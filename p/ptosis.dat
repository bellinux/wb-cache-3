5|$|Two {{cases from}} Liberia {{experienced}} severe neurological symptoms, including <b>ptosis,</b> nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, and respiratory distress. A child in Ghana died within 20 minutes after being {{bitten by a}} snake suspected to be from this species.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{was injured}} {{when he was}} hit in the face by a {{football}} during a New York Jets mini-camp on April 3, 2002, while filming a special for ESPN, a blow which damaged his cornea. He received surgery but afterwards suffered from <b>ptosis,</b> or drooping of the eyelid.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the {{oculomotor nerve}} (III) can cause double vision (diplopia) and {{inability}} {{to coordinate the}} movements of both eyes (strabismus), also eyelid drooping (<b>ptosis)</b> and pupil dilation (mydriasis). Lesions may also lead to inability to open the eye due to paralysis of the levator palpebrae muscle. Individuals suffering from a lesion to the oculomotor nerve may compensate by tilting their heads to alleviate symptoms due to paralysis {{of one or more}} of the eye muscles it controls.|$|E
5|$|The local {{symptoms}} of victims bitten by the many-banded krait are usually neither serious swelling nor pain; the victims merely feel slightly itchy and numb. Systemic symptoms occur, in general, one {{to six hours}} after being bitten by this snake. Symptoms may include bilateral <b>ptosis,</b> diplopia, discomfort in the chest, general ache, weak feeling in limbs, ataxia, glossolysis, loss of voice, dysphagia, tunnel vision, and difficulty breathing. In case of serious bite, suppression of breathing may occur, leading to death. Hyponatremia is also seen, but less commonly.|$|E
5|$|A bite from a {{black mamba}} causes initial {{neurological}} and neuromuscular symptoms that may commonly include headache and a metallic taste in the mouth, which may {{be accompanied by a}} triad of paresthesias, profuse perspiration and salivation. Other symptoms may include <b>ptosis</b> and gradual bulbar palsy. Localised pain or numbness around the bite site is common but not typically severe; therefore, application of a tourniquet proximal to the bite site is feasible and may assist in slowing the onset of prominent neurotoxicity. Without appropriate treatment, symptoms typically progress to more severe reactions such as tachydysrhythmias and neurogenic shock, leading to death by asphyxiation, cardiovascular collapse, or respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|Bites {{in which}} {{envenomation}} does occur are usually painless {{and may not}} even be noticed when contact is made. Teeth may remain in the wound. Usually, little or no swelling occurs, and rarely are any nearby lymph nodes affected. The most important symptoms are rhabdomyolysis (rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) and paralysis. Early symptoms include headache, a thick-feeling tongue, thirst, sweating, and vomiting. Symptoms that can occur 30minutes to several hours after the bite include generalized aching, stiffness, and tenderness of muscles all over the body. Passive stretching of the muscles is also painful, and trismus, which is similar to tetanus, is common. This is followed later on by symptoms typical of other elapid envenomations: a progressive flaccid paralysis, starting with <b>ptosis</b> and paralysis of voluntary muscles. Paralysis of muscles involved in swallowing and respiration can be fatal.|$|E
25|$|CPEO is a slowly {{progressing}} disease. It {{may begin}} {{at any age}} and progresses {{over a period of}} 5–15 years. The first presenting symptom of <b>ptosis</b> is often unnoticed by the patient until the lids droop to the point of producing a visual field defect. Often, patients will tilt the head backwards to adjust for the slowly progressing <b>ptosis</b> of the lids. In addition, as the <b>ptosis</b> becomes complete, the patients will use the frontalis (forehead) muscle to help elevate the lids. The <b>ptosis</b> is typically bilateral, but may be unilateral for a period of months to years before the fellow lid becomes involved.|$|E
25|$|Gravity is {{the most}} common cause of breast <b>ptosis,</b> or sagging.|$|E
25|$|The {{surgical}} {{management of}} breast <b>ptosis</b> is {{evaluated by the}} degree of severity.|$|E
25|$|Congenital <b>ptosis</b> and pseudoptosis, as {{observed}} in {{conditions such as}} tuberous breast deformity (constricted breast).|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} reduction mammoplasty {{procedure is}} determined by the volume of breast tissues (glandular, adipose, skin) to be resected (cut and removed) from each breast, and the degree of breast <b>ptosis</b> present: Pseudoptosis (sagging of the inferior pole of the breast; the nipple is at or above the inframammary fold); Grade I: Mild <b>ptosis</b> (the nipple is below the IMF, but above the lower pole of the breast); Grade II: Moderate <b>ptosis</b> (the nipple is below the IMF; yet some lower-pole breast tissue hangs lower than the nipple); Grade III: Severe <b>ptosis</b> (the nipple is far below the IMF; no breast tissue is below the nipple). The full, corrective outcome of the surgical re-establishment of a bodily-proportionate bust becomes evident at 6-months to 1-year post-operative, during which period the reduced and lifted breast tissues settle upon and into the chest. The post-operative convalescence is weeks long, depending upon the corrections performed; and some women might experience painful breast-enlargement during the first post-operative menstruation.|$|E
25|$|Post-explantation <b>ptosis,</b> {{the sagging}} of the inelastic skin envelopes, once emptied {{of the breast}} implants.|$|E
25|$|In the post-menopausal woman, besides gravity, such breast <b>ptosis</b> atrophy is {{aggravated by}} the inelasticity of overstretched, aged skin.|$|E
25|$|Grade II: Moderate <b>ptosis</b> — The nipple {{is located}} below the IMF; yet some lower-pole breast tissue hangs {{lower than the}} nipple.|$|E
25|$|Acquired or {{relative}} <b>ptosis,</b> {{as seen in}} the post-mastectomy breast reconstruction of a bust that is of natural and proportionate size, look, and feel.|$|E
25|$|Grade I: Mild <b>ptosis</b> — The nipple {{is located}} below the inframammary fold (IMF), but remains located above the lower pole of the breast.|$|E
25|$|Grade III: Advanced <b>ptosis</b> — The nipple {{is located}} below the IMF, {{and is at}} the maximum {{projection}} of the breast from the chest.|$|E
25|$|Grade IV: Severe <b>ptosis</b> — The nipple is {{far below}} the inframammary fold, {{and there is no}} lower-pole breast tissue below the nipple.|$|E
25|$|Grade I: Mild breast <b>ptosis,</b> {{which can}} be {{corrected}} with breast implant augmentation, or with a periareolar skin resection (crescent lift), with or without breast augmentation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of a woman’s life, her breasts change in size and volume as the skin {{envelope}} becomes inelastic, and the Cooper’s suspensory ligaments—which suspend the mammary gland high against the chest—become loose, and so cause the falling forward and the sagging of the breast and the nipple-areola complex (NAC). Moreover, additional to tissue prolapse, postpartum diminishment (involution) of the voluminous milk glands in the breast aggravates the looseness of the suspensory ligaments, and of the inelastic, overstretched skin envelope. Mastopexy corrects said degenerative physical changes, by elevating the (internal) parenchymal tissues, cutting and re-sizing the skin envelope, and transposing the nipple-areola complex higher upon the breast hemisphere. The degree of breast <b>ptosis</b> of each breast is determined by the position of the nipple-areola complex (NAC) upon the breast hemisphere; <b>ptosis</b> of the breast is measured with the modified Regnault <b>ptosis</b> grade scale.|$|E
25|$|The usual mastopexy {{patient is}} the woman who desires the {{restoration}} of her bust (elevation, size, and contour), because of the post-partum volume losses of fat and milk-gland tissues, and the occurrence of breast <b>ptosis.</b> The clinical indications presented by the woman—the degrees of laxness of the suspensory Cooper’s ligaments; and of the breast skin-envelope (mild, moderate, severe, and pseudo ptosis)—determine the applicable restorative surgical approach for lifting the breasts. Grade I (mild) breast <b>ptosis</b> can be corrected solely with breast augmentation, surgical and non-surgical. Severe breast <b>ptosis</b> can be corrected with breast-lift techniques, such as the Anchor pattern, the Inverted-T incision, and the Lollipop pattern, which are performed with circumvertical and horizontal surgical incisions; which produce a periareolar scar, at the periphery (edge) of the nipple-areola complex (NAC), and a vertical scar, descending from the lower margin of the NAC to the horizontal scar in the infra-mammary fold (IMF), where the breast meets the chest; such surgical scars are the aesthetic disadvantages of mastopexy.|$|E
25|$|Occasional problems: <b>ptosis</b> of the eyelid, microophthalmia, {{cleft lip}} {{with or without}} a cleft palate, webbed neck, short neck, tetralogy of Fallot, coarctation of the aorta, spina bifida, and hydrocephalus.|$|E
25|$|Laurence Kirwan {{published}} an alternative classification system for <b>ptosis</b> {{of the primary}} or non augmented breast that {{is meant to be}} better suited than the Regnault scale for planning surgery.|$|E
25|$|Grade III: Severe <b>ptosis,</b> {{which usually}} can be {{corrected}} with the circumvertical and horizontal incisions of the Anchor mastopexy (inverted-T incision), {{regardless of the}} type of pedicle used (inferior or superior).|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of cavernous sinus thrombosis is made clinically, with imaging studies {{to confirm the}} clinical impression. Proptosis, <b>ptosis,</b> chemosis, and cranial nerve palsy beginning in one eye and progressing to the other eye establish the diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Grade II: Moderate <b>ptosis,</b> {{which can}} be {{corrected}} with a circumareolar donut mastopexy technique featuring Benelli cerclage suturing; and with circumvertical-incision (lollipop mastopexy) techniques such as the Regnault B Mastopexy (and the Lejour–Lassus breast reduction).|$|E
25|$|According to a DRSS user manual, {{poor quality}} images (which may apply to other methods) {{may be caused}} by cataract, poor dilation, <b>ptosis,</b> {{external}} ocular condition, or learning difficulties. There may be artefacts caused by dust, dirt, condensation, or smudge.|$|E
25|$|The {{contraindications}} for mastopexy are few: aspirin use, tobacco smoking, diabetes, {{and obesity}} are medical and health conditions {{associated with increased}} incidences of nipple necrosis. In resolving the perceived <b>ptosis</b> {{of a woman with}} encapsulated breast implants, the surgeon determines her suitability for a breast lift procedure after explantation, which facilitates assessment of the true degree of <b>ptosis</b> present in the explanted breasts; likewise the assessment of the effects of a combined breast-lift and revision-augmentation procedure, featuring the removal and the replacement of breast implants. For the woman who is at high risk for developing breast cancer (primary or recurrent), the mastopexy might alter the histologic architecture of the breasts, which tissue change might interfere with the accurate MRI detection and subsequent treatment of cancer; the risks and benefits will be discussed in that setting.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle-aged}} woman, breast <b>ptosis</b> usually {{is caused by}} the {{postpartum}} hormonal changes to the maternal body, which depleted the quantity of adipose fat tissue and atrophied the milk glands, and because of the inelasticity of the skin envelope, which was overstretched by the engorgement of lactation.|$|E
25|$|Horner's syndrome* {{results from}} {{damage to the}} {{sympathetic}} innervation of the eye. Signs include enophthalmos (sunken eye), miosis (small pupil), elevated third eyelid, and <b>ptosis</b> (drooping of the upper eyelid). Usually the syndrome in dogs is idiopathic, {{but it can also}} be caused by trauma, tumors, or ear infections.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, mastopexy surgery {{techniques}} {{also are}} applied to reduction mammoplasty, which is the correction of oversized breasts. Psychologically, a mastopexy procedure to correct breast <b>ptosis</b> is not indicated by medical cause or physical reason, but by the self-image of the woman; that is, the combination of physical, aesthetic, and mental health requirements of her Self.|$|E
25|$|Breast {{reduction}} by liposuction only {{cannot be}} performed upon {{a woman whose}} mammogram indicates that the oversized breast is principally composed of hypertrophied milk glands. Furthermore, liposuction mammoplasty also is contraindicated for any woman whose mammograms indicate the presence of unevaluated neoplasms; likewise, {{the presence of a}} great degree of breast <b>ptosis,</b> and an inelastic skin envelope.|$|E
25|$|In realizing {{a breast}} lift, a {{conservative}} surgical technique produces the fewest, least visible scars after excising (cutting) excess folds of {{skin from the}} skin-envelope, when either replacing or rearranging or augmenting the internal breast tissues (parenchymal and adipose). Breast lift techniques are known according {{to the number of}} scars produced, which is related to the achievable degree of breast-lift. Pre-operatively, the patient and the surgeon decide upon the appropriate surgical technique (superior, medial, or inferior pedicle) that will achieve the best degree of breast lift. Generally, breast <b>ptosis</b> (sagging) is determined by the locale of the nipple-areola complex upon the breast; the lower the nipple-areola complex, the greater the degree of breast prolapsation (<b>ptosis).</b> Nonetheless, in breast-lift surgery, the primary consideration is the tissue viability of the nipple-areola complex, so that the outcome is a functionally sensate breast of natural size, contour, and feel.|$|E
25|$|There {{are eight}} {{serological}} varieties of the bacterium denoted by the letters A to H. The toxin {{from all of}} these acts {{in the same way}} and produces similar symptoms: the motor nerve endings are prevented from releasing acetylcholine, causing flaccid paralysis and symptoms of blurred vision, <b>ptosis,</b> nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, cramps, and respiratory difficulty.|$|E
25|$|The sole {{application}} of breast augmentation mammoplasty to correct minimal breast <b>ptosis</b> (Grade I) usually is effected with a breast implant prosthesis. The dual {{application of}} mastopexy and of breast augmentation surgeries — as one surgical procedure — requires thorough planning, {{because of the}} required resections of the parenchymal tissues. The periareolar incision lends itself to breast prosthesis implantation and to nipple-areola complex transposition, whilst maintaining the tissue viability of the nipple-areola complex.|$|E
25|$|Some {{physical}} malformations {{associated with}} Edwards syndrome include small head (microcephaly) {{accompanied by a}} prominent back portion of the head (occiput), low-set, malformed ears, abnormally small jaw (micrognathia), cleft lip/cleft palate, upturned nose, narrow eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), drooping of the upper eyelids (<b>ptosis),</b> a short breast bone, clenched hands, choroid plexus cysts, underdeveloped thumbs and/or nails, absent radius, webbing of {{the second and third}} toes, clubfoot or rocker bottom feet, and in males, undescended testicles.|$|E
