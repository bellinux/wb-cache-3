There was also no official effort for a re-evaluation of the communist past. Cracks in this consensus occurred after 1998, when the anti-communist opposition came to power. Revisionist tendencies appeared which portrayed Yugoslavia as a peoples' prison and tried to rehabilitate personalities from Macedonian history, previously kept out of the national pantheon. The main dividing line was the one between historians who kept to the radical dissociation of Macedonian from Bulgarian history, and those who accepted the cultural proximity between these two peoples.

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] History. "December 2011 "During the height of the memorialization movement in the United States, varying groups of women, northern, southern, white and black, used the memory of the Civil War to achieve their social, economic and political goals. Southern sympathizing white women and African American women in Missouri took part in this <b>process.</b> <b>Historians</b> have paid close attention to the memorialization movement in the United States, but few have focused on the events and experiences that led to the participation of these women in this contest over memory. This dissertation explores the memorial work of Missouri women from its roots in the Civil War through the height of the memorial movement in the late nineteenth century. The damage and loss brought on by the Civil War and the consequent process of rebuilding their lives culminated in the memorialization efforts of black and white women although through differing methods for their work. Southern sympathizing white women worked through organizations such as the United Daughters of the Confederacy and African American women filed claims to the Federal Government for their men's Civil War pension. Divided by slavery in the antebellum period and by the post war persistence of racial hierarchies, this close examination of the memorial work of forty Missouri women, twenty southern sympathizing women and twenty African American women, explores the ways in which their gendered experiences as mothers, wives and daughters arguably united them...|$|R

The basic assumption of most of the work produced by historians of Afro-American women {{is that there is a}} large body of unexplored accomplishment that merely awaits those with the interest and resources to dig it out and write it up. They view Black women as being oppressed by a number of social forces such as racism and sexism. They do not see Black women as mere victims, or as being defeated by these forces. They assume that since Black people have not only survived but have contributed much to the world in which we live, Black women must have played a large role in those <b>processes.</b> <b>Historians</b> of Black women generally emphasize racial as opposed to sexual oppression, study Black women within the general context of the history of Black Americans, and pay little attention to matters of sexual preference or to the personal and private behavior of those they are studying. Black feminists, on the other hand, seem to come to the study of Black women with the concerns of the White feminist movement, most of whose participants share the racist attitudes of White males. Black feminists tend to emphasize issues of sexual preference and personal, private behavior, and give a much greater weight to the role of sexual oppression by Black males in determining the life chances of Black females. They assume, in many cases, that Black women were oppressed in much the same way as White women [...] i. e., were denied political and economic roles of significance. Black feminists, therefore, are very weak on the actual achievements of Black women throughout their history in the United States.
