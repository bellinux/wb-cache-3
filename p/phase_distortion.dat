40|$|In the {{development}} of fast axial flow (FAF) high power CO 2 lasers the increase of mass flow and the reduction of <b>phase</b> <b>distortions</b> are of main interest in the realisation of high output power with high beam quality. Both topics strongly depend on {{the layout of the}} flow system for the convective cooling of the medium. Reducing the pressure losses in the closed loop gas circuit guarantees an enhanced mass flow in the system. The element at the outlet of the discharge tubes is the place of the largest pressure losses in FAF CO 2 lasers. Optimized geometries have been developed to increase the mass flow significantly. The inlet into the discharge tube is of major interest due to <b>phase</b> <b>distortions</b> of the active medium. Besides stationary, statistical <b>phase</b> <b>distortions</b> strongly influence the output power and beam quality. The influence of inlet geometries on the flow profile has been investigated. The discharge stability could be clearly improved by new developed geometries.

40|$|Adaptive optics is {{concerned}} with the correction of <b>phase</b> <b>distortions</b> in wavefronts which degrade the quality of images produced by optical systems. It was originally developed for both astronomy and the military, where the Earth's atmosphere causes distortions, although other uses are now being developed. As ground based telescopes become increasingly large the size and complexity of adaptive optics systems also increase, creating "extreme adaptive optics”. This thesis deals with such an adaptive optics system. A novel self referenced phase shifting interferometer based on a liquid crystal (LC) waveplate is presented which can measure high spatial frequency <b>phase</b> <b>distortions.</b> This is then coupled to a LC spatial light modulator wavefront corrector. The geometry is matched such that {{there is no need for}} a wavefront reconstructor. The performance is measured in two stages. Firstly, spatially where static <b>phase</b> <b>distortions</b> are measured by the interferometer and corrected. Secondly, temporally where a simple analogue feedback is implemented to show correction over a single corrector pixel for fast time varying <b>phase</b> <b>distortions.</b> This work builds on other published research on using point diffraction interferometry in adaptive optics. The novelty lies in the development of a new implementation of a point diffraction interferometer, and in the demonstration of a high-speed closed loop single channel system. This work therefore contributes to the groundwork required to build an extreme adaptive optics system whose complexity scales linearly with the size (area) of the telescope aperture.

40|$|The {{trend of}} {{development}} in fast axial flow CO 2 lasers with transversal RF excitation leads to increasing laser power with high beam quality. Since the power density of the discharge is limited due to thermal instabilities scaling the output power enforces an increase of the discharge dimensions and the mass flow for the convective cooling of the medium. Under the boundary conditions of large discharge volume and high mass flow the active medium affects the optical path of the laser beam by stationary as well as statistical <b>phase</b> <b>distortions.</b> Output power and beam quality are strongly impaired by <b>phase</b> <b>distortions</b> of the active medium. The description and diagnosis of the instationary, statistical <b>phase</b> <b>distortions</b> is an important field of activity {{in the development of}} high power CO 2 lasers and an important step in optimizing the beam source. In order to estimate the influence of gas flow state and discharge conditions, a measurement technique to evaluate the statistical phase distort ions is presented. Parallel beams of coherent light being chopped at high frequency pass the medium to be investigated. Propagating through the medium the beams suffer different refractions which can be measured as a relative motion of the beams to each other. The different refractions are caused by density and temperature inhomogeneities and fluctuations in the discharge. The relationship between measured signals and characteristical quantities of the statical <b>phase</b> <b>distortions</b> is discussed. The measurement technique as well as experimental examples are presented...|$|R

A system model for the OSI physical layer including a transmitter, the propagation channel, and a receiver is presented. The emphasis lies on a realistic modelling of the radio frequency part of the system including coupling among the antenna elements, noise, and accurate models for components of the analog front end. Adverse effects may occur there leading to amplitude and <b>phase</b> <b>distortions.</b> Several systems with different numbers of transmit and receive antennas are compared.

40|$|We {{address the}} case, when {{querying}} to the oracle in Grover's algorithm {{is exposed to}} noise including <b>phase</b> <b>distortions.</b> Another possibility is that the oracle-box wires are specially modified by an opposite party that tries to prevent correct receiving data from the oracle. This situation coincides with the experienced truth that an access to prophetic knowledge cannot be common and direct. To study the problem, we introduce a simple model of collective <b>phase</b> <b>distortions</b> {{on the base of}} phase damping channel. In the model used, the probability of the success is not altered via the the oracle-box wires per se. So, <b>phase</b> <b>distortions</b> of the considered type can hardly be detected via any one-time query to the oracle. However, the success probability is significantly changed, as the errors are introduced as an intermediate step into the Grover iteration. The success probability is investigated with respect to variations of the parameter that characterizes the amount of phase errors. It turns out that the success probability is decreased significantly even if the amount of phase errors is not very high. Moreover, the success probability quickly reduces to the value of one half, which corresponds to the completely mixed state. We also study how trade-off relations between quantum coherence and the success probability are modified in the presence of noise of the considered type. Comment: 11 pages, three figure...|$|R

40|$|Microfabricated devices {{designed}} to provide phase contrast in the transmission electron microscope must be free of <b>phase</b> <b>distortions</b> caused by unexpected electrostatic effects. We find that such <b>phase</b> <b>distortions</b> occur even when a device is heated to 300 degrees C during use {{in order to avoid}} the formation of polymerized, carbonaceous contamination. Remaining factors that could cause unwanted <b>phase</b> <b>distortions</b> include patchy variations in the work function of a clean metal surface, radiation-induced formation of a localized oxide layer, and creation of a contact potential between an irradiated area and the surround due to radiation-induced structural changes. We show that coating a microfabricated device with evaporated carbon apparently eliminates the problem of patchy variation in the work function. Furthermore, we show that a carbon-coated titanium device is superior to a carbon-coated gold device, with respect to radiation-induced electrostatic effects. A carbon-coated, hybrid double-sideband/single-sideband aperture is used to record in-focus, cryo-EM images of monolayer crystals of streptavidin. Images showing no systematic phase error due to charging are achievable under conditions of lowdose data collection. The contrast in such in-focus images is sufficient that one can readily see individual streptavidin tetramer molecules. Nevertheless, these carbon-coated devices perform well for only a limited length of time, and the cause of failure is not yet understood. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
