The target area is mid-latitude locations, such as Europe, where a fairly simple local ionospheric delay model {{can be used to}} simplify the estimator. A total of 8 local ionospheric model are tested in different European locations under different levels of ionosphere activities (high to very high). The simulations assume that the NeQuick model is representative of the true ionospheric delay. The results show that different local ionospheric delay models can be used depending upon the location of the user: from very simple ones in Northern Europe where the ionospheric delay does not vary greatly with the ionosphere <b>pierce</b> <b>point</b> location to more advanced ones in Southern and middle Europe where the ionospheric delay can vary significantly with the <b>pierce</b> <b>point</b> location. It also shows that it can provide very interesting results in terms of ionospheric delay estimation accuracy: as an example, the ionospheric delay estimation error standard deviation at L 1 in Toulouse, France, is below 50 cm for a very active ionosphere (within the top 7. 5 % over 1931 - 2001) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{geometric}} {{calibration method}} that determines a complete description of source-detector geometry was adapted to a mobile C-arm for cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). The non-iterative calibration algorithm calculates a unique {{solution for the}} positions of the source (Xs,Ys,Zs), detector (Xd,Yd,Zd), <b>piercing</b> <b>point</b> (Uo,Vo), and detector rotation angles (ϕ,θ,η) based on projections of a phantom consisting of two plane-parallel circles of ball bearings encased in a cylindrical acrylic tube. The prototype C-arm system was based on a Siemens PowerMobil modified to provide flat-panel CBCT for image-guided interventions. The magnitude of geometric nonidealities in the source-detector orbit was measured, and the short-term (∼ 4 h) and long-term (∼ 6 months) reproducibility of the calibration was evaluated. The C-arm exhibits large geometric nonidealities due to mechanical flex, with maximum departures from the average semicircular orbit of ΔUo= 15. 8 mm and ΔVo= 9. 8 mm (for the <b>piercing</b> <b>point),</b> ΔX and ΔY= 6 – 8 mm and ΔZ= 1 mm (for the source and detector), and Δϕ∼ 2. 9 °, Δθ∼ 1. 9 °, and Δη∼ 0. 8 ° (for the detector tilt∕rotation). Despite such significant departures from a semicircular orbit, these system parameters were found to be reproducible, and therefore correctable by geometric calibration. Short-term reproducibility was < 0. 16 mm (subpixel) for the <b>piercing</b> <b>point</b> coordinates, < 0. 25 mm for the source-detector X and Y, < 0. 035 mm for the source-detector Z, and < 0. 02 ° for the detector angles. Long-term reproducibility was similarly high, demonstrated by image quality and spatial resolution measurements over a period of 6 months. For example, the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) in axial images of a thin steel wire increased slightly {{as a function of the}} time (Δ) between calibration and image acquisition: FWHM= 0. 62, 0. 63, 0. 66, 0. 71, and 0. 72 mm at Δ= 0 s, 1 h, 1 day, 1 month, and 6 months, respectively. For ongoing clinical trials in CBCT-guided surgery at our institution, geometric calibration is conducted monthly to provide sufficient three-dimensional (3 D) image quality while managing time and workflow considerations of the calibration and quality assurance process. The sensitivity of 3 D image quality to each of the system parameters was investigated, as was the tolerance to systematic and random errors in the geometric parameters, showing the most sensitive parameters to be the <b>piercing</b> <b>point</b> coordinates (Uo,Vo) and in-plane positions of the source (Xs,Ys) and detector (Xd,Yd).

30|$|In this study, we {{have used}} the FAI {{observed}} by the EAR and the GPS scintillation observed by a GPS receiver at the EAR site to detect the plasma bubble occurrence. As shown in Fig.  2, the FAI occurrence is not always consistent with the GPS scintillation occurrence. This discrepancy could be attributed mainly to the following two reasons. (1) Since EAR {{is located at the}} magnetic latitude of 10.4 °S, plasma bubbles that do not reach the latitude of the EAR are not observed. FAIs are mostly observed with the EAR at altitudes higher than 250  km. The apex altitude of the field-of-view of the EAR at a 250 -km altitude is 420  km (Dao et al. 2016). Consequently, no plasma bubbles that are confined at an apex altitude lower than 420  km are detected with the EAR. On the other hand, the GPS scintillation measurement covers an area within a zenith angle of less than 60 °, i.e., an area within a radius of approximately 470  km, and thus the plasma bubbles that do not reach the field-of-view of the EAR can be observed with the GPS measurements. (2) The ionospheric <b>pierce</b> <b>points</b> of the ray path of GPS radio waves move either from SSW to NNE or from NNW to SSE at approximately 100  m/s. Plasma bubbles immediately after sunset move eastward at 100 – 150  m/s on average (e.g., Otsuka et al. 2006). Since the movements of both the ionospheric <b>pierce</b> <b>points</b> and plasma bubbles have an eastward component, {{it is possible that the}} <b>pierce</b> <b>points</b> cannot come across the plasma bubbles although multiple satellites are available simultaneously, implying that GPS measurements at a single site may miss the plasma bubble occurrence. Consequently, in this study, {{we have used}} both FAIs and GPS scintillations and defined the day of plasma bubble occurrence as the day when either the FAIs or GPS scintillations are detected.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe propose two new {{approaches}} regarding recent fault offset measurements {{by studying the}} seismogenic potential of the Jasneuf Fault. The NE trending right-lateral strike-slip Jasneuf Fault is the southwestern extension of the Belledonne fault system in the Vercors Massif. This fault, which is located in an intraplate domain, does not show strongly associated seismicity but displays morphological anomalies {{that are related to}} recent faulting (right-lateral offset of Late Cenozoic cliffs, recent talwegs, and post Ganz scarps). The two methods that we use to quantify fault slip are as follows. 1 - Recursive measurements of stream offsets are conducted. This analysis reveals that a stream network can display characteristic distances between streams that can be mistakenly interpreted as long-term cumulative fault offsets. A comparison of the apparent stream offset values and stream spacing values is necessary to identify the true offsets. 2 - We propose a new method that enables us to determine the fault offset and kinematics by using recursive measurements of topographic apparent offsets to counter the lack of morphologic features that are used to determine <b>piercing</b> <b>points</b> or lines. This method enables us to define each possible slip vector for numerous artificial <b>piercing</b> <b>points</b> along a fault. The slip vector that is shared by these <b>piercing</b> <b>points</b> is the true slip vector. By applying these methodologies, we determine that the Jasneuf Fault has accumulated slip since the Messinian, which corresponds to an average slip rate of 0. 13 +/- 0. 03 mm year The extension of the fault is poorly constrained. Nevertheless, if we do not consider the potential aseismic (creep slip) component of the faulting, we calculate that this fault could generate Mw 5. 7 earthquakes every similar to 500 years according to Wells and Coppersmith's scaling laws and by assuming that the faulting is limited to the sedimentary cover and the Vercors Plateau.

40|$|The normal offset {{decomposition}} is {{a recent}} method to approximate images consisting of smoothly colored areas separated by smooth contours. In contrast to wavelet approximation methods, that perform suboptimally in this setting, this method is non-linear; the decomposition depends on the actual data. In every iteration new points are added by searching from {{the midpoint of the}} edges of the previous approximation along the normal direction until it pierces the surface that represents the image. The <b>piercing</b> <b>points</b> are attracted towards steep transitions and the edges that connect the new and old points line up against the contours in the image. The normal offset algorithm starts from an initial triangulation of the rectangular domain of the image. The choice of these initial points and triangles determines the quality of the resulting approximation. The most straightforward choice for the initial triangulation is two triangles that share a diagonal. However, other choices that are adapted to the specific image are more efficient because <b>piercing</b> <b>points</b> will only be placed on, or in the neighborhood of a discontinuity if there is an edge crossing the contour on the previous level.

40|$|We shall {{consider}} the compression of piecewise smooth images. This means images that consist of (relatively few) smooth regions {{that have a}} smooth boundary. These boundaries are the only singularities in the image-function. It {{is well known that}} classical wavelets have a poor approximation behaviour on this kind of images. We present an approach that has its origin in computer graphics. An image can be considered as a geometric object when the pixel values are z-values perpendicular to the xy-plane. A triangulation of the xy-plane gives a mesh whose vertices interpolate the object in 3 D space. That mesh can be decorated for example by polynomial wavelets. Successive resolution levels are added as differences to that mesh when the triangulation is refined. In particular we shall measure the difference for each edge of the mesh along the normal bisector of the edge in a plane (though that edge) normal to the xy-plane. That is what is called a normal offset. The <b>piercing</b> <b>point</b> is where that bisector pierces the surface.
