Although data rates around 100 kbps are enough for crucial data transmission, {{it may be useful}} to reach a few megabits per second for other applications like networking. Such data rates can be reached by using appropriate modulations and clock rates. In this paper, three forms of <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulations</b> (<b>PAM)</b> are compared in a vehicular context: on-off keying (OOK), PAM- 4 and generalized space-shift keying (GSSK). A prototype based on off-the-shelf light-emitting diodes (LED) headlamps is used for static tests in straight line configuration, with an inter-vehicle distance up to 30 m, and curves of minimum radius 100 m and inter-vehicle distance of 10 m. These tests show that OOK and GSSK are the most interesting modulations for highway platooning applications. OOK provides indeed a good mobility while remaining simple to implement. A 1 Mbps link of BER below 10 − 6 is thus demonstrated. In GSSK, the data rate reaches 2 Mbps for an equivalent BER.

In this contribution, we conceive a low-complexity universal soft demapper, which reduces the demapper’s complexity considerably for the binary-reflected Gray-labeled <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulation</b> (<b>PAM),</b> phase shift key-ing (PSK), quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), and ampli-tude phase-shift keying (APSK) relying on product constellation labeling (product-APSK).

We determined that both PAM and DO techniques similarly discriminate between HI and LI and are significantly correlated in most parameters. HI results diverge, but results from LI samples do not. The hypothesis is presented that the divergence between PAM and DO at super-saturating irradiance may be an artifact arising from PAM's concurrent measurement of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). The results are shown to be reconciled if the energy diverted to NPQ {{is added to the}} PAM rates of electron transport.

40|$|Biofuels {{derived from}} microalgae may {{represent}} a key source for alternative energy vectors. Moreover, microalgae exhibit a great potential for sustainable production {{of a wide range}} of commodities and value-added products, including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals, which makes them suitable for biorefinery applications. Their high productivity and their ability to accumulate large amounts of lipids, along with their independence from arable land, put them in a competitive position with respect to traditional oil crops. However, the economical and energetic sustainability of large scale microalgae cultivation for biodiesel production are still debated. The most optimistic previsions are in fact based on gross estimates of productivity, derived by extrapolation of laboratory-scale data. Therefore, the development of reliable mathematical models that are capable of quantitative predictions of the behaviour of large-scale outdoor microalgae culture is of paramount importance. Such models prove especially useful in identifying which parameters have the largest impact on productivity, thereby providing a means for enhancing the growth conditions through design and operational changes. Moreover, accurate forecasts of microalgal growth in the outdoor conditions can lead to a better understanding of the real potential of microalgae-based biofuels. This Thesis aims of investigating the complex effect of light in the photosynthetic apparatus activity, and its effect on microalgae growth. The work presented in this Thesis follows two general lines. The first contribution has been to propose a general approach for model development. The proposed methodology guides the modelling effort in order to assure both an accurate representation of the calibration data, but most importantly also the identifiability of the model. The identifiability of a model, i. e. the possibility to estimate in accurate and reliable way its parametric set, is in fact, a necessary property for the model to be confidently used in process scale-up and optimization. The proposed methodology has been successfully applied to growth and fluorescence data of the sea water alga Nannochloropsis Salina. A second contribution is concerned with <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Amplitude</b> <b>Modulation</b> (<b>PAM)</b> fluorometry. A dynamic model of chlorophyll fluorescence has been developed. The model integrates photoproduction, photoregulation and photoinhibition processes in a semi-mechanistic way. The model has been calibrated against fluorescence data of a sample of the microalga Nannochloropsis gaditana. The proposed fluorescence model is capable of quantitative prediction of the state of the photosynthetic apparatus of microalgae in terms of their open, closed and damaged reaction centres under variable light conditions. Two promising application of the fluorescence model have also been analysed: (i) the model has been used for the prediction of photosynthesis rate versus irradiance (PI) -response curves based on PAM fluorometry; and (ii) a model based experiment design (MBDoE) approach has been followed to define new information rich PAM protocols to further validate and refine the model structure...|$|R

30|$|It {{is known}} that uncoded or analog {{transmission}} achieves the optimal performance theoretically attainable (OPTA) in MMSE sense when both the source and the channel are Gaussian and memoryless and have the same bandwidths [7]. Clearly, uncoded transmission cannot be optimal for sources with memory and when the source and channel bandwidths are not matched. For sources with memory, widely used digital source-coding techniques such as predictive quantization (PQ) transform coding (TC) [8] exploit source memory to achieve a coding gain and will outperform uncoded transmission if both the transmitter and the receiver have CSI. However, systems based on these techniques still suffer from the aforementioned cliff effect when the transmitter has no CSI. On the other hand, implementing good analog codes for sources with memory is difficult. A promising approach to benefit from both the robustness of analog transmission against CSNR variations and the source-coding gain due to source correlation is HDA coding. Fundamentally, HDA transmission involves the simultaneous transmission of a source in both digital and analog forms. Most previous work on HDA coding have used a form of layered transmission in which the base layer is digitally coded, and the quantization error of the base layer is transmitted as a refinement layer, using analog <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> (<b>PAM)</b> <b>modulation</b> [2, 9 – 12]. While {{a considerable amount of}} research has focused on HDA transmission of memoryless sources, much less work has been devoted to developing good HDA codes for sources with memory. In particular, when the source has memory, the optimal HDA coding involves a very different design trade-off compared to coding a memoryless source. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} design HDA systems which can simultaneously benefit from high coding gain of PQ or TC and the CSNR-independent optimality of a parallel analog transmission. PQ is the standard technique for moderate to high bit-rate (16 – 40 kbs) speech coding [13] while TC is a staple in image and video compression.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Error vector {{magnitude}} (EVM) {{is one of}} {{the widely}} accepted figure of merits used to evaluate the quality of communication systems. In the literature, EVM has been related to signalto-noise ratio (SNR) for data-aided receivers, where preamble sequences or pilots are used to measure the EVM, or under the assumption of high SNR values. In this paper, this relation is examined for nondata-aided receivers and is shown to perform poorly, especially for low SNR values or high modulation orders. The EVM for nondata-aided receivers is then evaluated and its value is related to the SNR for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulation</b> (<b>PAM)</b> signals over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and Rayleigh fading channels, and for systems with IQ imbalances. The results show that derived equations can be used to reliably estimate SNR values using EVM measurements that are made based on detected data symbols. Thus, presented work can be quite useful for measurement devices such as vector signal analyzers (VSA), where EVM measurements are readily available.
