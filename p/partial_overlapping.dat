This is termed the separation model. An L2 speaker will speak one of the languages, but no connection is made between them in the mind (Cook 2003: 7). Another proposed model is the integration model, which suggests that rather than having two separate mental lexicons, an L2 speaker has one lexicon where words from one language are stored from one language alongside words from the other. Regarding phonology, {{it has been found}} that L2 speakers sometimes have one merged system for producing speech, not distinguished by L1 or L2. The integration model focuses on how there is a balance between the unique elements of both languages, and how they form one system. Though these two proposed models offering interesting perspectives, it is impossible to have total separation because both languages exist in the same mind. Total integration is impossible because we are able to keep the languages apart in our minds (Cook 2003: 7). Another proposed model is the link language model. This model illustrates the idea that two languages within the same mind are able to influence and interact with one another.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} how the power absorption and damping in a linear generator for wave energy conversion are affected by <b>partial</b> <b>overlap</b> between stator and translator. The theoretical study shows that the electrical power {{as well as the}} damping coefficient change quadratically with <b>partial</b> stator <b>overlap,</b> if inductance, friction and iron losses are assumed independent of <b>partial</b> stator <b>overlap</b> or can be neglected. Results from onshore experiments on a linear generator for wave energy conversion cannot reject the quadratic relationship. Measurements were done on the inductance of the linear generator and no dependence on <b>partial</b> stator <b>overlap</b> could be found. Simulations of the wave energy converter’s operation in high waves show that entirely neglecting <b>partial</b> stator <b>overlap</b> will overestimate the energy yield and underestimate the peak forces in the line between the buoy and the generator. The difference between assuming a linear relationship instead of a quadratic relationship is visible but small in the energy yield in the simulation. Since the theoretical deduction suggests a quadratic relationship, this is advisable to use during modeling. However, a linear assumption could be seen as an acceptable simplification when modeling since other relationships can be computationally costly...|$|R
40|$|Many {{wireless}} {{channels in}} different technologies {{are known to}} have <b>partial</b> <b>overlap.</b> However, due to the interference effects among such partially overlapped channels, their simultaneous use has typically been avoided. In this paper, we present a first attempt to model <b>partial</b> <b>overlap</b> between channels in a systematic manner. Through the model, we illustrate that the use of partially overlapped channels is not always harmful. In fact, a careful use of some partially overlapped channels can often lead to significant improvements in spectrum utilization and application performance. We demonstrate this through analysis as well as through detailed application-level and MAC-level measurements. Additionally, we illustrate the benefits of our developed model by using it to directly enhance the performance of two previously proposed channel assignment algorithms — one in the context of wireless LANs and the other in the context of multi-hop wireless mesh networks. Through detailed simulations, we show that use of partially overlapped channels in both these cases can improve end-to-end application throughput by factors between 1. 6 and 2. 7 in different scenarios, depending on wireless node density. We conclude by observing that the notion of <b>partial</b> <b>overlap</b> can be the right model of flexibility to design efficient channel access mechanisms in the emerging software radio platforms...|$|R
