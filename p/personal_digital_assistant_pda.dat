500|$|On May 26, 1995, Bill Gates {{sent the}} [...] "Internet Tidal Wave" [...] {{memorandum}} to Microsoft executives. The memo described Netscape with their Netscape Navigator as a [...] "new competitor 'born' on the Internet." [...] The memo outlines Microsoft's failure {{to grasp the}} Internet's importance, and in it Gates assigned [...] "the Internet {{the highest level of}} importance" [...] from then on. Microsoft began to expand its product line into computer networking and the World Wide Web. On August 24, 1995, it launched a major online service, MSN (Microsoft Network), as a direct competitor to AOL. MSN became an umbrella service for Microsoft's online services, using Microsoft Passport (now called a Microsoft account) as a universal login system for all of its web sites. The company continued to branch out into new markets in 1996, starting with a joint venture with NBC to create a new 24-hour cable news television station, MSNBC. The station was launched on July 15, 1996 to compete with similar news outlets such as CNN. Microsoft also launched Slate, an online magazine edited by Michael Kinsley, which offered political and social commentary along with the cartoon Doonesbury. In an attempt to extend its reach in the consumer market, the company acquired WebTV, which enabled consumers to access the Web from their televisions. Microsoft entered the <b>personal</b> <b>digital</b> <b>assistant</b> (<b>PDA)</b> market in November with Windows CE 1.0, a new built-from-scratch version of their flagship operating system, designed to run on low-memory, low-performance machines, such as handhelds and other small computers. 1996 saw the release of Windows NT 4.0, which brought the Windows 95 GUI and Windows NT kernel together.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the summer}} of 1992, the team could {{demonstrate}} portions of the new platform, including the Green OS, the Oak language, the libraries, and the hardware. Their first demonstration, on September 3, 1992, focused on building a <b>personal</b> <b>digital</b> <b>assistant</b> (<b>PDA)</b> device named Star7 that had a graphical interface and a smart agent called [...] "Duke" [...] to assist the user. In November of that year, the Green Project was spun off to become Firstperson, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Microsystems, and the team relocated to Palo Alto, California. The Firstperson team {{had an interest in}} building highly interactive devices, and when Time Warner issued a request for proposal (RFP) for a set-top box, Firstperson changed their target and responded with a proposal for a set-top box platform. However, the cable industry felt that their platform gave too much control to the user, so Firstperson lost their bid to SGI. An additional deal with The 3DO Company for a set-top box also failed to materialize. Unable to generate interest within the television industry, the company was rolled back into Sun.|$|E
