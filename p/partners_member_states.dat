40|$|The Czech agrarian trade {{represents}} a variable {{which has been}} developing in a very dynamic manner over time. In the time period of 2000 – 2010 alone, {{the value of its}} turnover grew up from about USD 2. 7 billion to about USD 11. 4 billion. In the course of time, the Czech agrarian foreign trade has gradually adjusted its territorial as well as commodity structure. As regards the importance of trading <b>partners,</b> <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> of the European Union have unequivocally come to the fore. Accession of CR to the EU has also left its marks on the existing form of the commodity structure of realized exports and imports alike, while especially the export structure has still been shaping in a significant manner. The paper deals with issues related to development of the Czech agrarian foreign trade with the aim to identify its comparative advantages {{in the area of the}} commodity and territorial structure both in relation to the global market (the market of third countries outside the EU) and in relation to the EU 27 countries. Following are the outcomes of the paper conclusions. Although the Czech agrarian trade as the whole does not have any comparative advantages both with respect to the market of the EU 27 countries and with respect to third countries (the global market), its individual aggregations are able to win through and gain comparative advantages, especially with respect to individual Member States of the EU. In this respect, it is worth mentioning that in 2010, 190 (i. e. nearly one half) out of 390 studied export flows realized to 26 Member States of the EU were competitive. The comparative advantages are more or less evenly distributed among the new and old Member States of the EU. As regards third countries, it may be stated that the Czech agrarian export has comparative advantages only to a significantly limited scope...|$|E
40|$|The global {{information}} society is evolving at breakneck speed. The accelerating convergence between telecommunications, broadcasting multimedia and {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs) is driving new products and services, as well as ways of conducting business and commerce. At the same time, commercial, social and professional opportunities are exploding as new markets open to competition and foreign investment and participation. The modern world is undergoing a fundamental transformation as the industrial society that marked the 20 th century rapidly gives way to the {{information society}} of the 21 st century. This dynamic process promises a fundamental change in all aspects of our lives, including knowledge dissemination, social interaction, economic and business practices, political engagement, media, education, health, leisure and entertainment. We are indeed {{in the midst of a}} revolution, perhaps the greatest that humanity has ever experienced. To benefit the world community, the successful and continued growth of this new dynamic requires global discussion. ” Information and communication technology (ICT) is an engine of growth and change for the world economy. If this technology is to be harnessed to enhance democratic principles, it must contribute to the creation and enrichment of an educated, informed citizenry; it must incorporate the accumulated knowledge and creativity of the past; and it must anticipate and enhance creativity for the future. In this context, it is essential that ICT embrace a cultural agenda. Development effectiveness depends to a great extent on “solutions” that resonate with a community’s sense of identity and culture creates that sense of identity. Culture encompasses human knowledge, values, beliefs, behavior, customs, language, ideas, codes, institutions, heritage, rituals, and creative expression all of which constitute essential signposts for understanding who we are and what we do. If advances in health, commerce, education, and economic growth are to be implemented and sustained, understanding culture is critical. ” Discussion Topic Rapid changes in technology make preservation of digital content a challenge. Taking into account the huge amount of data to be filed, the amount of time to accomplish with this task and more over the period of time we need to store such information, we have to value objectively a problem up till now widely underestimated and that is the conservation for long periods of time of digital information. This subject takes us to consider two aspects, the first is technological obsolescence and the second the 'temporary instinct' of the so-called 'permanent supports'. The biological clock of ICT beats smaller time slices compared to those considered worldwide in the field of cultural heritage. Digital formats becomes suddenly obsolete and disappear. An extraordinarily long-lived solution, such as the PC/DOS in great favour for over twenty years, represents a short-lived apparition if compared to the time spent in state owned archives. Computer systems are aging, media on which information is stored are disintegrating, the magnetic technology diskette survives without problems for thousands of hours but not enough to be considered 'permanent' for those aims. What are the long-term implications if we rely on current digital technology to preserve our cultural memory? [] Long term preservation of digital archives is a issue not only for cultural content but even for e-government and social services. Background At the G 7 Conference on the Information Society in February 1995 Ministers approved 11 pilot projects to show the potential offered by the Information Technologies. The implementation of the pilot projects was encouraged by the G 7 Heads of State at their Summit in Halifax in June 1995. The Pilot Project N° 5 named “Multimedia Access to World Cultural Heritage” had its first demonstration of work in progress at the ISAD (Information Society and Developing Countries) Conference in Midrand (May 1996). The official progress report dated April 1996 reported that the third area that can be defined as application and testing, “will be made up of projects that are market-oriented and based on the fruition of cultural heritage. This area will include projects aiming at producing advanced cultural applications by using the present technological resources in key sectors (education, entertainment, cultural tourism, disadvantaged users etc.). ” In this area an assessment of museums initiatives outlines that the World Wide Web assumed a leading position within the “Multimedia Access to World Cultural Heritage” project. Following such a trend, after the interesting experience carried out on the occasion of WWW 7 in Brisbane (April 1998) and the 9 th World Wide Web Conference (Amsterdam May 2000), a complete set of session called "Culture Track" was devoted to draw a comprehensive scenario on emerging technologies and trends on "networked arts". With specific reference to virtual museums WWW 9 Culture Track explored how multimedia technology could re-engineer the way visitors presently perceive their visiting a museum or art gallery. Added value associated to ICT applications. Real issues of Museums & Archives. E-Society, E-Commerce and E-Services as part of the whole scenario were considered too. On the occasion of the tenth WWW (Hong Kong) a similar panel was held and as a follow up an official final report was submitted to the G 8 on the occasion of the G 8 held in Genoa (Italy). A number of suggestion and remarks was gathered and similar / converging publications were issued (eg. Vital Links for a knowledge culture). On the occasion of WWW 11 held in Honolulu a successful session mainly devoted to a comparative evaluation of European and Asian issues in the field of Culture and Traditions took place. On the occasion of the World Wide Web Conference 2003, held in Budapest, we had the opportunity to enjoy a fruitful panel outlining different issues and achievements in the field of access, policies and IPR protection fo on line cultural applications and services. This year (2003) on December, the World Summit on the Information Society will provide a unique opportunity for all key stakeholders to assemble at a high-level gathering and to develop a better understanding of this revolution and its impact on the international community. It aims to bring together Heads of State, Executive Heads of United Nations agencies, industry leaders, non-governmental organizations, media representatives and civil society in a single high-level event. The roles of the various <b>partners</b> (<b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> UN specialized agencies, private sector and civil society) in ensuring smooth coordination of the practical establishment of the information society around the globe will also be at the heart of the Summit and its preparation. Some of the contributors to the proposed panel will contribute even to the WSIS event reporting major findings and achievements on the occasion of WWW panel. Thanks to this scenario, following the WSIS 2003 and anticipating the WSIS 2005, it seems to be the right moment to collect the efforts and promote a debate on “Culture in a world-wide information society” with specific reference to digital archives and related issues...|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{itself is}} based on two parts of empirical research. The first-and most extensive-part consists of interviews taken from both Commission officials and officials of the <b>member</b> <b>states</b> responsible for the negotiations on the Uruguay Round. The aim of these interviews was not to conduct research on the substantive issues of these three cases, but rather to help the interviewees to focus their answers to concrete cases, {{rather than to the}} abstract notion of negotiations in general. This was necessary because the questions themselves dealt with {{the way in which the}} respondents perceived their role and the opportunities of their role in both the internal EU decision-making and the external negotiations, and the limits of that role and its opportunities, given the involvement of the other actors (external <b>partners,</b> <b>member</b> <b>state</b> representatives, Commission representatives), and the impact of certain factors (the institutional context of the external negotiations, stages in the negotiating process, politicization of negotiating issues, the constraints of the mandate, etc. The second part of the empirical research was conducted through interviews taken from European Commission negotiators, officials from the Belgian trade administration in the course of February and April 2001, and British trade officials in the course of May and July 2002. Due to time constraints, it only concerns seven Commision officials, three Belgian officials, and seven British officials directly involved in the operation of the Committee 133. The interviews focused on the preparations of the (abortive) attempts to start the Millennium Round (1998 - 99) and on the subsequent Commission attempts to reanimate the idea of a round of multilateral trade negotiations in 2001 (Everything but Arms Initiative) ...|$|R

The investigation shows which main fields they have been working in, especially which applicant countries have co-operated with which countries in which fields? The objective of this investigation has been to find patterns of co-operation and we have tried to answer the following questions: Which behaviour concerning the co-operation can be found especially in the fields of “ Information Society Technologies ” and “Quality of life and management of living resources” and on the horizontal programme “International Co-operation”? Which <b>partners</b> of <b>member</b> <b>states</b> of the European Union have been working with Eastern European partners in European projects in which fields? We have been using the data of CORDIS for the investigation. For structuring, visualising and analysing the huge amount of data the bibliometric method BibTechMonTM has been used. BibTechMonTM has been developed at the Department of Technology Management of ARC Seibersdorf research GmbH and uses the co-word analysis (Kopcsa and Schiebel, 1998).
