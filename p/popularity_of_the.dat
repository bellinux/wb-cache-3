40|$|Recently, microblogging {{is widely}} studied by the {{researchers}} in <b>the</b> domain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> online social network (OSN). How to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>popularities</b> <b>of</b> microblogging users is an important research field, which {{can be applied to}} commercial advertising, user behavior analysis and information dissemination, and so forth. Previous studies on the evaluation methods cannot effectively solve and accurately evaluate <b>the</b> <b>popularities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> microbloggers. In this paper, we proposed an electromagnetic field theory based model to analyze <b>the</b> <b>popularities</b> <b>of</b> microbloggers. <b>The</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> source in microblogging field is first put forward, which is based on <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> source in <b>the</b> electromagnetic field; then, one’s microblogging flux is calculated according to his/her behaviors (send or receive feedbacks) on the microblogging platform; finally, we used three methods to calculate one’s microblogging flux density, which can represent one’s popularity on the microblogging platform. In the experimental work, we evaluated our model using real microblogging data and selected the best one from the three popularity measure methods. We also compared our model with the classic PageRank algorithm; and the results show that our model is more effective and accurate to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>popularities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> microbloggers...|$|R

2500|$|There is {{no limit}} on movie length. The average movie length is between 30 seconds and 3 minutes, but user created films {{can be as}} long as budget will allow (although a 10-minute film might require over 20 game years of filming). In sandbox mode however, a {{director}} can have the movie shoot automatically with the correct options turned on, allowing a 15–20 minute movie made in about a minute. If this is chosen, however, the movie's crew rating will be announced as [...] "awful". Once the actors, extras, director and crew are assigned to a film, production begins, with <b>the</b> entire staff <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film travelling between sets to film the movie. The sandbox mode allows films to be created without undergoing the lengthy production process, and with budgets of over $100 million. A film {{can be one of}} five genres: action, comedy, horror, romance or science fiction. The main effect genre choice has is that real world events affect <b>popularity</b> <b>of</b> different genres.
