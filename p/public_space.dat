5|$|During {{this period}} the {{struggle}} against colonial rule intensified. Nationalism became the pre-eminent cause. Claiming Indian superiority became the tool of cultural revivalism resulting in an essentialising model of Indian womanhood {{similar to that of}} Victorian womanhood: special yet separated from <b>public</b> <b>space.</b> Gandhi legitimised and expanded Indian women's public activities by initiating them into the non-violent civil disobedience movement against the British Raj. He exalted their feminine roles of caring, self-abnegation, sacrifice and tolerance; and carved a niche for those in the public arena. Peasant women {{played an important role in}} the rural satyagrahas of Borsad and Bardoli. Women-only organisations like All India Women's Conference (AIWC) and the National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW) emerged.

40|$|Purpose: Modern digital <b>public</b> <b>spaces</b> are {{evolving}} {{from being}} mostly the provider of ICT and internet connection to institutions that provide complex {{range of services}} {{and support for the}} community. With this shift in their focus new challenges are emerging, among others their sustainability. Methodology/Approach: We build on and extend the methodology of Digital Cooperatives project. Within this project, survey on 59 digital <b>public</b> <b>spaces</b> from 12 EU countries was conducted. These digital <b>public</b> <b>spaces</b> were examined in 21 areas, some of them relating to their sustainability. We further analyse the sustainability issue of these digital <b>public</b> <b>spaces.</b> Findings: We identified three main issues affecting sustainability of digital <b>public</b> <b>spaces</b> – budgeting, services and community. Digital <b>public</b> <b>spaces</b> mostly rely on public funding and have limited diversification of their funds, which increases a risk when one source of funding drops out. They also have to build a strong community of users, supporters, which will make use of their capacities and helps co-create new services and thus strengthen and improve the community itself. Originality/Value of paper: Research in this paper is based on the collection of best practices from various EU countries in the field of digital <b>public</b> <b>spaces.</b> Recommendations based on these practices could help the creation of new, and in current digital <b>public</b> <b>spaces.</b> </p...|$|R

5|$|In 304, {{the fourth}} edict ordered all persons, men, women, and children, {{to gather in}} a <b>public</b> <b>space</b> and offer a {{collective}} sacrifice. If they refused, {{they were to be}} executed. The precise date of the edict is unknown, but it was probably issued in either January or February 304, and was being applied in the Balkans in March. The edict was in use in Thessalonica (Thessaloniki, Greece) in April 304, and in Palestine soon after. This last edict was not enforced at all in the domains of Maximian and Constantius. In the East, it remained applicable until the issue of the Edict of Milan by Constantine and Licinius in 313.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} tackles the <b>public</b> <b>spaces</b> in {{the framework}} of Beirut’s mosaic history, whereby the Middle East constitutes the background and not the context. It will first identify the <b>public</b> <b>spaces</b> by shedding light on their genesis and tracking their evolution in relation to the city’s urban history. The approach on <b>public</b> <b>spaces</b> history is multi-faceted and interpreted based on a parallelism between the urban morphology, the functional aspect, social practice, and political condition. In the same way, the significance of <b>public</b> <b>spaces</b> is tackled as an intrinsic dimension transcending their physical existence, embodied in history and memory, thus their possible cohesion in the future city plans. Following the study of the relation of <b>public</b> <b>spaces</b> to the urban history, a closer look will be based on the two case studies of Martyr Square and the Waterfront’s transformation across time. The research followed a dual scale reading of the public spaces; a general overview was followed by a closer perspective on the case studies. This bi-fold display highlighted all the complex aspect of the <b>public</b> <b>spaces</b> in their continuities and discontinuities within the city model. The question on <b>public</b> <b>spaces</b> arises {{in the aftermath of the}} reconstruction following the civil war years.

40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>spaces,</b> {{which have}} been one of the {{integral}} components of cities for centuries, have become subject to broad concern for more than two decades. Particularly under the shadow of globalisation and privatisation, attractive and alluring <b>public</b> <b>spaces</b> have been placed at the centre of the major world cities and the old-industrial cities competing as part of a search for new niches in the competitive urban markets. Starting from the late- 1970 s, the significance of <b>public</b> <b>spaces</b> has also been increasingly recognised by the central and local governments in Britain. A number of `well-designed' <b>public</b> <b>spaces</b> were developed especially through the regeneration and revitalisation schemes of the derelict lands of industrial estates, declining waterfronts and city centres. The recent interest in British <b>public</b> <b>spaces</b> is a promising sign, as the decline and decay had lately become their predominant characteristics. Nevertheless, it raises major questions about their `publicness'. As an outcome of these questions, this thesis focuses on the problem of the `publicness' of the 1990 s <b>public</b> <b>spaces</b> in Britain. It concentrates on the two recently developed <b>public</b> <b>spaces</b> in the city centre of Newcastle upon Tyne. By employing the case study method as a research strategy, this research, first, examines the history of the two <b>public</b> <b>spaces,</b> as well as their physical, psychological, social, political, economic and symbolic roles and problems just before the recent redevelopment schemes began. Then, it analyses the `publicness' of the recent development schemes of both <b>public</b> <b>spaces</b> through i) planning and design, ii) construction, iii) management and maintenance, iv) use phases with regard to the criteria of `access', `actors' and `interest'. Here, it mainly tries to see whether the `publicness' of the <b>public</b> <b>spaces</b> has reduced or increased with the recent development schemes. Finally, comparing one case to another, it seeks to show the similarities and differences of both <b>public</b> <b>spaces</b> in terms of the change in their `publicness' with the recent development schemes. The findings of the research lead us to draw the conclusion that, with the recent development schemes, both cases turned into `good-looking' and `well-maintained', but `less' <b>public</b> <b>spaces</b> than they used to be.

Taste of Cherry is punctuated throughout by shots of this kind, including distant overhead shots of the suicidal Badii's car moving across the hills, usually while he is in conversation with a passenger. The physical distancing techniques stand in juxtaposition to the dialogue, which always remains in the foreground.
