While trade reforms are often expected to decrease <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> as firms struggle to compete in international markets, {{there is the possibility}} that increased competition may improve firm efficiency and provide a positive impetus to firm profitability. This paper is different from many others in this area in that it considers both these possibilities. An efficiency index is created to directly analyse the impact of changing efficiency levels on firm <b>profit</b> <b>margins.</b> Results indicate that liberalization significantly influenced <b>profit</b> <b>margins.</b> However, its main effect is through the impact that it has had on other firm variables - market shares, advertising, R&D and exports - all of which changed after 1991. While exports have had a pro-competitive effect on <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> in the selected sample, AD and R&D both cause an increase in <b>profit</b> <b>margins.</b> It is also found that neither capital nor managerial capabilities (as proxied by remuneration) are particularly effective in increasing <b>profit</b> <b>margins.</b> ...|$|R

Using various panel data procedures over twenty-nine subsectors of Turkish manufacturing for the 1980 - 1996 period, we focus on three sets of issues: (1) the effect of openness {{on the extent of}} market concentration as measured in CR 4 ratios; (2) the behavior of gross <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> (markups) in relation to openness, concentration ratios, and real wage costs; and (3) the behavior of sectoral real investments (by destination) in relation to the <b>profit</b> <b>margins,</b> real wage costs, and the openness indicator. Our results suggest very little structural change in the sectoral composition and nature of market concentration and behavior of <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> under the post- 1980 structural adjustment reforms and outward-orientation. We find that, contrary to expectations, "openness" had very little impact, if any, on <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> (markups), and, within manufacturing, the trade-adjusting sectors reveal a positive relationship between the <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> and openness. <b>Profit</b> <b>margins</b> are found to be positively and significantly related to concen- © 2002 M.

40|$|International audienceThe {{interdependence}} {{of competition and}} <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> {{is one of the}} mostimportant features of industrial economics. According to mainstream economics,intense market competition results in smaller <b>profit</b> <b>margins.</b> Long-termprofitsare contingent on competition and market imperfections; perfect competitionpresumably reduces profits to zero in the long run (excluding normal profitsallocated to managerial compensation). This relationship between competition and <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> is also an importanttheme in Post Keynesian economics. From Joan Robinson’s Economics of ImperfectCompetition to Kalecki’s analyses of the degree of monopoly, Post Keynesianeconomists have long been interested in this aspect of economic theory. There ishowever no unified Post Keynesian view of competition and its effect on profitmargins, and we can, from a historical perspective, identify two main strands ofPost Keynesian thought, each relying on a specific theory to determine profitmargins. Based on the ‘imperfect competition and degree of monopoly principle,’the first branch considers that <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> are the result of market structure(market imperfections). In this view, as in the theory of monopoly capitalism (seeMoudud, Bina, and Mason 2013), <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> thus positively correlate withcompetition imperfections and degree of monopoly. Rooted in the ‘investmentfinancing tradition,’ including the works of Alfred Eichner and Adrian Wood, thesecond branch makes a direct connection between <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> and internalfinancing requirements for investment. We consider this second view to clearlyrepresent Fred Lee’s economic thinking (see, for example, Lee 2013 b). A comparisonof the two Post Keynesian branches shows that the first position closelyresembles what later became the mainstream view on the relation between competitionand <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> (notably with the emergence of the so-calledstructure-conduct-paradigm in the 1960 s and 1970 s, which remains an influential theoreticalframework for industry-competitionpolicies). Stated succinctly, in this theory, thetougher the competition, the smaller the <b>profit</b> <b>margins.</b> Nevertheless, empirical testing of this theory poses certain difficulties. In fact,many empirical studies fail to validate the direct link between the degree of competition(regardless of the chosen criterion) and <b>profit</b> <b>margins.</b> Such studies often report weak or even paradoxical results, be it at the sectoral or macroeconomiclevel. These unexpected results can, however, be explained from the‘investment-financing’theory of <b>profit</b> <b>margins.</b> Based on the theories of AlfredEichner (1973, 1976) and Adrian Wood (1975), this second branch offers anexplanation for why <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> are independent of the degree of competitionin the market. In conjunction with his two-curvediagram, Adrian Wood’s analysis(developed in his 1975 book, A Theory of Profits) enables us to show whycompetition does not affect the determination of <b>profit</b> <b>margins.</b> Therefore, thesecond strand’s main contribution is its emphasis on the fundamental role ofinternal financing in capitalist economies, which is the missing link in industrialeconomics...|$|R
5|$|During 1934 {{and early}} 1935, all feature films {{released}} in the Dutch East Indies {{had been made by}} the American-educated Chinese-Indonesian director The Teng Chun. His low budget but popular films were mainly inspired by Chinese mythology or martial arts, and although aimed at ethnic Chinese proved popular among native audiences because of their action sequences. The Teng Chun's dominance was an effect of the Great Depression and changing market trends. The Great Depression had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices, ensuring that there was a very low <b>profit</b> <b>margin</b> for local films. As a result, cinemas in the colony mainly showed Hollywood productions, while the domestic industry decayed. The Teng Chun was able to continue his work only because his films often played to full theatres.|$|E

This affected both the King's and the Duke's companies, {{but most of all}} the King's which had no <b>profit</b> <b>margin</b> to carry them through the lean years. In 1682, the companies merged, or rather, the King's was absorbed by the Duke's. Led at the time by Thomas Betterton, the United Company, as it was now called, chose Drury Lane as their production house, leaving the Duke's Company's theatre in Dorset Garden closed for a time. In 1688 Betterton was removed from managerial control by Alexander Davenant, son of William Davenant, the original patent holder for the Duke's Company. Davenant's management (with Charles Killigrew) proved brief and disastrous, and by 1693 he was fleeing to the Canary Islands in the wake of embezzlement charges. The Theatre Royal found itself in the hands of lawyer Christopher Rich for the next 16 years.|$|E

5|$|When the Parliament of Norway {{decided on}} 8 October 1992 {{to build a}} new central airport for Eastern Norway, they also decided that the main mode of ground {{transport}} to the airport should be by railway. While the previous airport, Oslo Airport, Fornebu, was located just outside the city limits; the new Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, would be located some 50 kilometers north of the city, outside the reach of the existing public transport systems. The political agreement to build the airport stated that the costs of construction should not be borne by the tax payers. As a result, the entire airport was financed with money borrowed through Oslo Lufthavn AS, a subsidiary of the Norwegian Airport Administration. The same principle was chosen for the airport rail link. The Norwegian State Railways (NSB) created the subsidiary, NSB Gardermobanen AS, on 24 November 1992 to perform the construction of the line. This company would be able to charge train operators using the railway line; and could use this income to cover its down payments and interest on the debt created to pay for the infrastructure investment.
