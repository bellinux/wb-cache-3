500|$|Using a large cast of characters—a wide {{assortment}} of personalities and cultures—allows Lat {{to comment on}} {{a wider range of}} topics than is possible {{with a small group of}} characters. [...] Malaysian comics scholar Muliyadi Muhamood commented that the humour in Lat's cartoons is evoked through graphical and textual means; [...] "short, compact dialogues" [...] and puns form the text while [...] "facial expressions and actions" [...] of the characters help to bring out the funny side of things. [...] Muliyadi further stated that Lat's works offer many levels of interpretation; one reader would laugh at Lat's cartoon for its slapstick, while another would find the same work hilarious for its subtle critique of society. [...] As an example, Muliyadi referred to a Keluarga Si Mamat strip published in 1972. [...] Malaysia was facing a shortage of qualified <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> then, and such duties were often placed on the shoulders of teachers of other faculties. [...] Lat illustrated an obese teacher who conducted a physical education session to his eventual collapse. [...] Muliyadi suggested that the cartoon could be interpreted as a simple tease of the teacher's plight, a suggestion to examine the curriculum taught (change physical education to an informal session), a remark on the shortage of teachers, or more extremely, a criticism of the government's failure to prevent the situation from happening.|$|E

In the end, Lady Mabel Fitzwilliam, sister of the 7th Earl and a local alderman, brokered a deal whereby the West Riding County Council leased most of the house for an educational establishment, leaving forty rooms as a family apartment. Thus, from 1949 to 1979, the house was home to the Lady Mabel College of Physical Education, which trained female <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers.</b> The college later merged with Sheffield City Polytechnic (now Sheffield Hallam University), which eventually gave up the lease in 1988 due to high maintenance costs.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the impact Cognitive CoachingSM, a {{mentoring}} tool, (a) has on <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>teacher</b> candidates’ teacher efficacy and (b) their perceptions of the impact Cognitive CoachingSM had on the lesson planning and lesson reflection abilities during a student teaching experience. Both quantitative and qualitative measures were employed to determine the impact of Cognitive CoachingSM <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>teacher</b> candidate’s teacher efficacy. The design for this study was a quasi-experimental design with an untreated control group with pre-test and post-test samples (Shadish, Cook 2 ̆ 6 Campbell, 2002). The quantitative date was collected through the Ohio State Teacher Efficacy Scale (OSTES) (Tschannen-Moran 2 ̆ 6 Hoy, 2001) and the <b>Physical</b> <b>Education</b> Teaching Efficacy Scale (PETES) (Humphries, Hebert, Daigle, 2 ̆ 6 Martin, 2012). The qualitative data, semistructured interviews, the planning and reflecting conversations in Cognitive CoachingSM, and an intervention open-ended survey helped identify how the intervention impacted <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>teacher</b> candidates’ teacher efficacy and perceptions. Overall, the impact of the treatment, Cognitive CoachingSM, had a statistically significant impact of <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>teacher</b> candidates’ teacher efficacy measured by the PETES and OSTES and the participants perceived Cognitive CoachingSM impacted their lesson planning, lesson reflection capabilities, and professional and personal lives. From these findings, a recommendation can be made to incorporate Cognitive CoachingSM, a mentoring tool, into <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> programs to foster growth in <b>teacher</b> efficacy among <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>teacher</b> candidates...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} issues {{fundamental to}} educating thoughtful, competent, intelligent teachers by highlighting arguments against out-of-field teaching in <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> programs.

The paper explains that <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> programs {{have the potential to}} fall under the guise of out-of-field teaching. Teacher preparation programs house an array of courses from the applied sciences and allied fields of <b>physical</b> <b>education,</b> which can stand alone as separate fields of study yet are possible out-of-field teaching assignments. People who are pursuing employment in predominantly undergraduate institutions within <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> programs must be able to teach within several content areas, yet {{more than half of the}} doctoral degree granting programs in physical education-pedagogy offer only specialized curriculums. When teachers are assigned to courses outside their area of study, the curriculum is weakened by fragmented content knowledge.
