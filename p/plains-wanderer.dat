50|$|The <b>plains-wanderer</b> (Pedionomus torquatus) is a bird, {{the only}} {{representative}} of family Pedionomidae and genus Pedionomus. It is endemic to Australia. The {{majority of the}} remaining population {{is found in the}} Riverina region of New South Wales.|$|E
5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports most of Victoria’s population of <b>plains-wanderers.</b> As well as the land used by the species, the IBA includes extensive areas of unsuitable farmland which {{has the potential for}} restoration to habitat suitable for <b>plains-wanderers.</b> It includes an area of woodland which supports the largest regional population of diamond firetails. [...] Birds of prey that breed in the area include spotted harriers and black falcons. Bush stone-curlews and painted honeyeaters have been recorded. The woodland area is important for brown treecreepers, black-chinned honeyeaters, grey-crowned babblers and hooded robins. Inland species near the south-eastern limit of their range include Australian ringnecks, chestnut-crowned babblers and white-winged fairy-wrens.|$|R
5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it contains most of the habitat suitable for <b>plains-wanderers</b> in the Riverina. [...] It also has good populations of other grassland birds, including brown songlarks, Australasian pipits, banded lapwings and singing bushlarks, {{as well as the}} arid biome restricted inland dotterel.|$|R
50|$|The Important Bird Area (IBA) {{has been}} {{identified}} as such by BirdLife International because it supports a large population of Eyrean grasswrens as well as small numbers of <b>plains-wanderers.</b> It also contains good numbers of grey falcons, Australian bustards, inland dotterels, banded whitefaces, grey-headed, grey, black and pied honeyeaters, gibberbirds, chirruping and chiming wedgebills, cinnamon quail-thrushes and painted finches.|$|R
50|$|Hakawai is an extinct genus {{of prehistoric}} birds that lived {{during the early}} Miocene to middle Miocene in New Zealand. According to a 2015 paper, Hakawai melvillei was a {{representative}} of {{a large group of}} birds that comprises the seedsnipes of family Thinocoridae) and the <b>plains-wanderer</b> (family Pedionomidae). This discovery sheds light on evolutionary processes at work when South America, Antarctica, Australia, and New Zealand were all parts of Gondwanaland.|$|E
50|$|Terrick Terrick National Park {{was one of}} {{the last}} {{remaining}} strongholds for the <b>Plains-wanderer,</b> an endangered Australian endemic bird species. Land management techniques employed by Parks Victoria has seen the species almost wiped-out, in addition to the creation of dangerous fuel loads, and the prevalence of many noxious weeds. The park is part of the Patho Plains Important Bird Area, so identified by BirdLife International principally because of its importance for the conservation of Plains-wanderers.|$|E
50|$|With Astrebla Downs National Park, Diamantina National Park forms {{part of the}} 7627 km2 Diamantina and Astrebla Grasslands Important Bird Area, {{identified}} by BirdLife International as such because {{it is one of}} few sites known for the critically endangered night parrot. It also supports globally important populations of the <b>plains-wanderer,</b> Australian bustard, straw-necked ibis, white-necked heron, inland dotterel, Bourke's parrot, black and pied honeyeaters, gibberbird, Hall's babbler, chestnut-breasted quail-thrush, cinnamon quail-thrush and spinifexbird.|$|E
50|$|The Boolcoomatta, Bindarrah and Kalkaroo Stations Important Bird Area is a 1402 km2 {{tract of}} land in {{north-eastern}} South Australia. It comprises three pastoral properties, 53,000 ha Kalkaroo Station, 24,000 ha Bindarrah Station, and 63,000 ha Boolcoomatta. The whole site has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports a significant population of endangered <b>plains-wanderers</b> - perhaps the largest population of the species outside the Riverina region of New South Wales.|$|R
50|$|The site {{encompasses}} {{remnants of}} native grassland inhabited by an endangered grassland bird in a monotypic family - the <b>plains-wanderer</b> - with the intervening farmland. The area has a Mediterranean climate with cool, damp winters and hot dry summers, supporting native tussock grassland dominated by Austrostipa and Austrodanthonia species. Other vegetation types are temperate grassy woodlands dominated by white cypress-pine, grey box and yellow box. There are also small areas of black box riparian woodland and granite outcrop shrubland.|$|E
50|$|Population decline {{has been}} caused by the {{conversion}} of native grasslands to cultivation and intensive predation by the introduced fox — the species' ground-nesting habits, poor flying ability, and tendency to run rather than fly from predators make it easy prey for the introduced fox. Sites identified by BirdLife International as being important for <b>plains-wanderer</b> conservation are Boolcoomatta, Bindarrah and Kalkaroo Stations in north-eastern South Australia, Diamantina and Astrebla Grasslands in western Queensland, Patho Plains in northern Victoria and the Riverina Plains in New South Wales.|$|E
50|$|The <b>plains-wanderer</b> is a quail-like ground bird, {{measuring}} 15 - 19 cm. It {{is such an}} atypical {{bird that}} it is placed in an entire family of its own, Pedionomidae. The adult male is light brown above, with fawn-white underparts with black crescents. The adult female is substantially larger than the males, and has a distinctive white-spotted black collar. They are excellent camouflagers, and will first hide at any disturbance. If they're approached too close, they will run as opposed to flying, which they are very poor at. Females lay four eggs, which the male then incubates.|$|E
50|$|Baker-Gabb studied {{agriculture}} and then biology at Massey University in North, New Zealand, graduating in 1978 with a master's degree in science {{for his work}} on the swamp harrier. He then went to Monash University in Melbourne, where he studied the swamp harrier, the spotted harrier and other Australian birds of prey to earn his PhD. He devoted himself from 1984 to 1987 to the study and conservation of the <b>plains-wanderer.</b> Between 1988 and 1989 he studied the habits of the red goshawk in the Northern Territory until 1990 when he joined the Department of Conservation and Environment in Victoria as a manager of threatened fauna, a role he carried out until 1992.|$|E
50|$|These grasslands are {{the western}} limit {{for much of}} the {{wildlife}} that lives here as further west is desert. Wildlife of the savanna includes mammals such as the mouse-like kultarr marsupial (Antechinomys laniger), tiger quoll (Dasyurus maculatus), and brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata). The western barred bandicoot (Perameles bougainville fasciata) and bridled nail-tail wallaby that once lived here are now presumed extinct in New South Wales. Birds include the endangered bush stone-curlew (Burhinus grallarius), superb parrot (Polytelis swainsonii), red goshawk (Erythrotriorchis radiatus), malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata) and <b>plains-wanderer</b> (Pedionomus torquatus), and reptiles include an endangered skink Anomalopus mackayi. The Riverina grasslands are home to birds such as the freckled duck, and wintering populations of swift parrot (Lathamus discolor).|$|E
5000|$|It was {{formerly}} {{believed to be}} related to the buttonquails and thus placed in the gamebird order Galliformes or with the cranes and rails in Gruiformes. DNA-DNA hybridization and RAG-1 sequence data places it as a wader related to the jacanas (Sibley & Ahlquist 1990, Paton et al. 2003, Thomas et al. 2004, van Tuinen et al. 2004). It thus represents a remarkable case of morphological convergence, or perhaps it is simply extremely plesiomorphic in morphology (the buttonquails, meanwhile, having turned out to be a very basal offshoot of the wader radiation). In the latter case, this would mean that the jacanas, painted snipe and seedsnipes [...] - [...] all ecologically very different birds [...] - [...] all evolved from birds very similar to the living <b>plains-wanderer.</b>|$|E
50|$|The park is very flat {{with few}} {{elevated}} features. For {{the most part}} it is grassland, with trees only along the watercourses and around the normally dry lakes and depressions.The low woodland is dominated by black box (Eucalyptus largiflorens) and River Cooba (Acacia stenophylla). Before European settlement saltbush, cotton bush and native grasses {{are likely to have}} been the main plant cover on the plains. However, over 100 years of grazing and some pasture improvement have modified this and the plant and animal communities do not represent the environments that existed prior to European settlement. Despite this, Willandra is important habitat for many native species, including the emu, the threatened <b>Plains-wanderer,</b> red and grey kangaroos, echidnas and a variety of reptiles, such as Gould's Sand Goanna and the Mulga Brown Snake.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are only}} two suprafamilial clades (natural groups) among the birds {{traditionally}} classified as Gruiformes. Rails (Rallidae), flufftails (Sarothruridae), finfoots and sungrebe (Heliornithidae), adzebills (Aptornithidae), trumpeters (Psophiidae), limpkin (Aramidae), and cranes (Gruidae) compose the suborder Grues and are termed [...] "core-Gruiformes" [...] (Fain et al. 2007). These are the only true Gruiformes. The suborder Eurypygae includes the kagu (Rhynochetidae) and sunbittern (Eurypygidae). These are not even remotely related to Grues. The families of mesites or roatelos (Mesitornithidae), button-quails (Turnicidae), Australian <b>plains-wanderer</b> (Pedionomidae), seriemas (Cariamidae), and bustards (Otididae) each represent distinct and unrelated lineages. Many families known only from fossils have been assigned to the Gruiformes, e.g., Ergilornithidae, Phorusrhacidae, Messelornithidae, Eogruidae, Idiornithidae, Bathornithidae, {{to name just a}} few (see below). Though some of these are superficially 'crane-like' and the possibility that some may even be related to extant families traditionally included in the Gruiformes, there are no completely extinct families that can be confidently assigned to core-Gruiformes.|$|E
50|$|The brown quail is also {{a member}} of the family Phasianidae that looks similar to the stubble quail, however the brown quail appears darker in colour. The white streaks that are obvious on the back of the stubble quail are thinner and less obvious on the brown quail. The brown quail does not have white streaks {{underneath}} its body like the stubble quail, but has black horizontal bars instead. This makes the brown quail look much darker than the stubble quail in flight. The brown quail's wings produce a whistling noise when flushed which is different from the whirring sound produced by the stubble quail's wings. The <b>plains-wanderer</b> is a highly endangered native species that looks very similar to the stubble quail but can be distinguished by their long yellow legs that can be observed during flight. The little buttonquail is a member of the Turnicidae family but is another species that is sometimes confused with the stubble quail. The little button-quail is a smaller bird with short, round wings and often makes a call of alarm when flushed, whereas stubble quail are vocally silent.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} order Gruiformes {{was established}} by the influential German avian comparative anatomist Max Fürbringer (1888). Over the decades, many ornithologists suggested {{that members of the}} order were in fact more closely related to other groups (reviewed by Olson 1985, Sibley and Ahlquist 1990). For example, it was thought that sunbittern might be related to herons and that seriemas might be related to cuckoos. Olson and Steadman (1981) were first to correctly disband any of the traditional Gruiformes. They recognized that the Australian <b>plains-wanderer</b> (family Pedionomidae) was actually a member of the shorebirds (order Charadriiformes) based on skeletal characters. This was confirmed by Sibley and Ahlquist (1990) based on DNA-DNA hybridization and subsequently by Paton et al. (2003), Paton and Baker (2006) and Fain and Houde (2004, 2006). Sibley and Ahlquist furthermore removed button-quails (Turnicidae) from the Gruifomes based on large DNA-DNA hybridization distances to other supposed Gruiformes. However, {{it was not until the}} work of Paton et al. (2004) and Fain and Houde (2004, 2006) that the correct placement of buttonquails within the shorebirds (order Charadriiformes) was documented on the basis of phylogenetic analysis of multiple genetic loci. Using 12S ribosomal DNA sequences, Houde et al. (1997) were the first to present molecular genetic evidence of gruiform polyphyly, although apparently they were not convinced by it. However, on the basis of numerous additional sequence data, it has been shown decisively that the traditionally recognized Gruiformes consist of five to seven unrelated clades (Fain and Houde 2004, Ericson et al. 2006, Hackett et al. 2008).|$|E
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{whether the}} <b>plains-wanderer</b> (Pedionomus torquatus), a species lacking the criteria {{outlined in the}} traditional flagship model, is a suitable local flagship for the Northern Plains Grasslands of Victoria in Australia. Questionnaires and telephone interviews were used to survey residents and natural resource management professionals and volunteers ('NRM participants') in communities living close to the Northern Plains Grasslands. Questionnaires were completed by 146 residents and 69 NRM participants, and 15 interviews were conducted. Results suggest that {{a significant proportion of}} the local community was aware of, and valued, the <b>plains-wanderer,</b> and that the species is currently functioning as an effective flagship for the region. Recommendations are provided for the future selection of flagship species in ecosystems where traditional flagships are not present...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Lowland native grasslands {{are among}} the most {{depleted}} ecosystems in south-eastern Australia, and contain a disproportionately large number of threatened plant species. Threatened grassland fauna such as the <b>Plains-wanderer</b> have suffered a similar decline. Plains-wanderers are permanent residents in their favoured patches of sparse native grassland. However, they cannot survive where these grasslands are converted to crops or dense introduced pasture, or are overgrazed by stock. In the five years since the publication of the first RAOU <b>Plains-wanderer</b> Conservation Statement in 1993, considerable effort has been expended in surveying and studying the temperate native grasslands of South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. This work has revealed that the status of the <b>Plains-wanderer</b> is worse than previously thought. A very significant new threat has emerged from an expanding rice industry in the Plains-wanderer’s stronghold, the Riverina of New South Wales. The situation for Plainswanderers in Queensland remains unclear, but {{there is no reason to}} suspect that it is improving given the expansion of the cotton industry and conversion of native grasslands to introduced pasture there. On the positive side, recent studies have provided refined information on managing native grasslands to maintain their biodiversity, and they provide some clear targets for urgent conservation action.

40|$|Author version made {{available}} {{in accordance with}} publisher copyright policy. The remarkable fauna of Australia evolved in isolation from other landmasses for millions of years, yet understanding the evolutionary history of endemic avian lineages on the continent is confounded by the ability of birds to disperse over geographical barriers even after vicariance events. The <b>Plains-wanderer</b> Pedionomus torquatus (Charadriiformes) is an enigmatic, predominantly sedentary, quail-like bird that occurs exclusively in sparse native grasslands of south-eastern Australia. It is the only known species of its family (Pedionomidae), and its closest relatives are the South American seedsnipes (Thinocoridae). Here we describe a further representative of this lineage, Oligonomus milleri gen. et sp. nov. from the Late Oligocene of South Australia (26 – 24 Ma), which predates the earliest record of P. torquatus by ca. 22 Ma and attests {{to the presence of}} this lineage during Australia's period of isolation (50 - 15 Ma). Based on the morphology of the coracoid and the palynological record, we propose that O. milleri and P. torquatus were ecologically disparate taxa, and that similar to coeval marsupials, O. milleri inhabited well-wooded habitats, suggesting that the preference for grassland in the extant P. torquatus and thinocorids is likely convergent and not ancestral. The speciation event leading to the evolution of the extant <b>Plains-wanderer</b> was probably triggered by the spread of grasslands across Australia in the Late Miocene-Pliocene, which this record predates. The presence of a pedionomid in the Late Oligocene of Australia strengthens the hypothesis of a Gondwanan divergence of the lineages giving rise to Thinocoridae and Pedionomidae...|$|E
