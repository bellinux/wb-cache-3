40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 Benjamin, a rather Frail boy of {{seven and a}} half, unhesitatingly walked through the forge puddle which {{obstructed}} his way. The water, especially toward the middle, proved too deep for his worn, <b>patched</b> <b>rubbers.</b> But Benjamin didn 2 ̆ 7 t mind a 2 ̆ 2 soaker 2 ̆ 2. In fact he rather enjoyed the momentary pleasure of the warm, muddy rain water on his feet. Nor did he even consider the scolding which invariably followed {{when he came home}} with his feet wet, his only unpleasant feeling arising when his feet later became chilly in the coolness of the June late-afternoon. His two older brothers would have been home from school long ago; first communion practice had detained him. Still, he would have been home earlier had he not remained after the others. When there were no people in the church he liked to walk its long aisles: he enjoyed the feel of the thick carpet as he walked: he imagined he might sink in it if he followed it through the small opening into the dark room next to the St. Joseph 2 ̆ 7 s altar and he always shivered and felt a kind of pleasant weakness when he approached it. 2 ̆...|$|R
50|$|The key to {{understanding}} {{the behavior of the}} balloons is understanding how the pressure inside a balloon varies with the balloons diameter. The simplest {{way to do this is}} to imagine that the balloon is made up of a large number of small <b>rubber</b> <b>patches,</b> and to analyze how the size of a patch is affected by the force acting on it.|$|R
40|$|We study rubber {{friction}} for {{tire tread}} compounds on asphalt road surfaces. The road surface topographies are measured using a stylus instrument and atomic force microscopy, {{and the surface}} roughness power spectra are calculated. The rubber viscoelastic modulus mastercurves are obtained from dynamic mechanical analysis measurements and the large-strain effective modulus is obtained from strain sweep data. The rubber friction is measured at different temperatures and sliding velocities, and is compared to the calculated data obtained using the Persson contact mechanics theory. We conclude {{that in addition to}} the viscoelastic deformations of the rubber surface by the road asperities, there is an important contribution to the rubber friction from shear processes in the area of contact. The analysis shows that the latter contribution may arise from <b>rubber</b> molecules (or <b>patches</b> of <b>rubber)</b> undergoing bonding-stretching-debonding cycles as discussed in a classic paper by Schallamach...|$|R
5000|$|Adidas Predator are a {{range of}} {{football}} boots developed by German sportswear manufacturers Adidas based on a prototype concept from the Australian former footballer Craig Johnston.

In late 2010, Adidas designed the new [...] "Power-spine" [...] technology, which they claim improves shot power by reducing the amount the foot bends back as it kicks the ball.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a study on the}} {{valuation}} and mathematical formulation of human touch sensation. First, the feelings of touch are collected on five natural and chemical fabrics through the SD (Semantic Differential) method questionnaires sent to twenty three examinees. The feelings are valued on each fabric by using the weigthed mean on graded factor feelings. The multiple regression analysis is then introduced to represent the overall evaluation of touch on every fabric by a linear function of the valuations on feelings of touch. Next, a soft tactile sensor made of a PVDF (Polyvinylidene Fluoride) film <b>patch</b> and <b>rubber</b> layers is assembled and slid over the same sample fabrics to collect the surface tactile information on the fabrics. The features on the collected data are then extracted by calculating the temporal average of absolute out signal and using the intensity of power spectral density on the medium frequency range. Comparison of the results show that the PVDF sensor well describes the tactile perception of forefingers...|$|R
50|$|Reverted rubber (steam) {{aquaplaning}} {{occurs during}} heavy braking {{that results in}} a prolonged locked-wheel skid. Only a thin film {{of water on the}} runway is required to facilitate this type of aquaplaning. The tire skidding generates enough heat to change the water film into a cushion of steam which keeps the tire off the runway. A side effect of the heat is it causes the rubber in contact with the runway to revert to its original uncured state. Indications of an aircraft having experienced reverted rubber aquaplaning, are distinctive 'steam-cleaned' marks on the runway surface and a <b>patch</b> of reverted <b>rubber</b> on the tire.|$|R
30|$|Metabolic sensors {{are also}} evolving. In {{patients}} with an arterial catheter or a central venous catheter, in situ measurements of blood gases and electrolytes are now possible [42]. They allow on demand measurements, quick results (no {{need to send}} anything to the laboratory), without any blood loss (no blood sample). Electronic tattoos or biostamps are currently under development. They are <b>rubber</b> <b>patches</b> that have a layer of flexible silicon wires (Fig.  5). The idea {{is to create an}} electronic device that is thinner than a sheet of paper, as flexible as a Band-Aid, and that can stick to the skin [43]. Beside their ability to record and transmit vital signs, these sensors have the potential to measure electrolytes and lactates in skin fluids [44]. If reliable, they may bring further opportunities such as remote metabolic monitoring in patients with chronic disease.|$|R
50|$|Rustin {{developed}} his ideas from 1908 with his colleague, Jean Larroque, registering a first patent, number 397 424, on December 15, 1908. Research {{ended with the}} start of World War I in 1914. Rustin fought in the army, {{then returned to the}} tyre industry after demobilisation, opening a workshop at 16 rue du Bois in Clichy (now the rue Henri Barbusse). It was there that he made the first modern puncture patch, a thin circular <b>patch</b> of flexible <b>rubber</b> that was already coated with a gum that {{did not need to be}} heated. He patented his invention, offering “ instant repair of inner tubes without solutions, without petrol, without anything ” The patent covered the patch, the dry fixative attached to it, and the protective bands which kept the patch clean until they were removed just before the repair.|$|R

Northern Dancer recovered quickly and reentered training in January. His first race at three was in a six-furlong prep under a new jockey, Bobby Ussery, who was instructed {{to take it easy}} and not use the whip. Northern Dancer was bumped at the start and fell {{to the back of the}} pack. He recovered and steadily advanced up the rail, only to become trapped behind several horses and get bumped again, eventually finishing third. Despite the instructions of Luro, Ussury had taken to his whip in the final strides of the race, which led the trainer to publicly criticize the rider. [...] "I believe in being very patient with my horses," [...] said Luro. [...] "I don't want punishment—under no circumstances." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{expansion of}} rubber plantations throughout East and Southeast Asia urgently requires improved methods for effective mapping and monitoring. The phenological information from rubber plantations was found effective in rubber mapping. Previous studies have mostly applied rule-pixel-based phenology approaches for rubber plantations mapping, which {{might result in}} broken patches in fragmented landscapes. This study introduces a new paradigm by combining phenology information with object-based classification to map fragmented <b>patches</b> of <b>rubber</b> plantations in Xishuangbanna. This research first delineated the time windows of the defoliation and foliation phases of rubber plantations by acquiring the temporal profile and phenological features of rubber plantations and natural forests through the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. To investigate the ability of finer resolution images at capturing the temporal profile or phenological information, 30 m resolution Landsat image data were used to capture the temporal profile, and a phenology algorithm to separate rubber plantations and natural forests was then defined. The derived phenology algorithm was used by both the object-based and pixel-based classification to investigate whether the object-based approach could improve the mapping accuracy. Whether adding the phenology information to the object-based classification could improve rubber plantation mapping accuracy in mountainous Xishuangbanna was also investigated. This resulted in three approaches: rule-pixel-based phenology, rule-object-based phenology, and nearest-neighbor-object-based phenology. The {{results showed that the}} rule-object-based phenology approaches (with overall accuracy 77. 5 % and Kappa Coefficients of 0. 66) and nearest-neighbor-object-based phenology approach (91. 0 % and 0. 86) achieved a higher accuracy than that of the rule-pixel-based phenology approach (72. 7 % and 0. 59). The results proved that (1) object-based approaches could improve the accuracy of rubber plantation mapping compared to the pixel-based approach and (2) incorporating the phenological information from vegetation improved the overall accuracy of the thematic map...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A new {{and robust}} 2 D phased array {{technique}} with multiple distributed actuators is experimentally studied for damage detection {{in a thin}} isotropic panel. This array technique is combined with guided Lamb wave (GLW) interrogation. A 2 D phased array technique using a single actuator, located {{near the center of}} the array, is unable to detect a linear crack whose orientation is normal to the wavefront of the GLW excited from the actuator. To overcome this limitation, the array is coupled with multiple actuators positioned at four different locations on a test panel, while the array is mounted at the center of the panel. A piezoceramic-based 2 D spiral phased array is used as a sensor array. The associated array signal processing is used to produce array responses and detect two types of damages, such as a <b>rubber</b> <b>patch</b> and linear crack. An innovative GLW propagation and reflection analysis method is implemented to evaluate the damage locations within the panel geometry. Experimental results demonstrate that the spiral array damage detection technique, using multiple distributed actuators, can provide more robust damage detection scheme, in thin isotropic panels, than the array tech-nique with a single actuator collocated at the center of the array...|$|R
40|$|Latex {{hypersensitivity}} {{manifests itself}} most commonly with contact urticaria. In this study, we investigated {{the frequency of}} latex hypersensitivity as a possible aetiological factor in patients with chronic urticaria (CU) and compared latex hypersensitivity of CU patients (n = 50) with that of rubber factory workers (n = 50) and healthy controls (n = 50). Prick test with latex and fruit extracts and determination of latex-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) were performed. As a risk factor, contact dermatitis due to rubber additives was tested by patch test. Latex hypersensitivity was detected in 14 % of CU patients, 12 % of rubber factory workers and 12 % of healthy controls (P > 0. 05). Positive <b>patch</b> test with <b>rubber</b> additives was detected in 6 % of CU and 4 % of rubber factory workers. 3 of 7 CU patients had sensitivity to fruits in addition to latex hypersensitivity. In 1 patient with CU, the clinical complaints {{were found to be}} related to latex hypersensitivity. These findings suggest that the frequency of latex hypersensitivity in CU patients is no higher than that in healthy individuals. However, CU patients should be carefully asked about latex allergy, as we demonstrated that 1 of the CU patients had undiagnosed symptomatic latex allerg...|$|R
40|$|Background and Design: We {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the frequency of latex allergy in our hospital and to to evaluate the clinical and demographical features of the cases. Materials and Methods: A detailed questionnaire was administered to healthcare workers by a physician. Skin prick test with latex and <b>patch</b> test with <b>rubber</b> chemicals {{and a piece of}} latex glove were performed for all healthcare workers. Latex-specific IgE was measured in serum. Results: The study sample consisted of 36 nurses, 14 doctors, and 50 healthcare workers. While 46 subjects had symptoms, 54 subjects had no symptoms. The relationship of clinical disease with working duration, exposure duration (hour/day), history of atopy, and drug/food allergies was statistically significant. Five nurses and 1 healthcare worker had positive skin prick test. Two of them had positive latex-specific IgE. Positive skin prick test statistically significantly correlated with occupation, working duration, exposure duration (hour/day) and positive latex-specific IgE. Two nurses and 2 healthcare workers had positive latex-specific IgE. Two of them had positive skin prick test. Positive latexspecific IgE statistically significantly correlated with working duration, exposure duration, and positive skin prick test. Patch test with a piece of latex glove was negative in all subjects. Three healthcare workers had positive patch test with thiuram-mix, one of them had also positive patch test with mercaptobenzothiazole. Discussion: One of the risk factors for latex allergy is occupations involving frequent exposure to latex products. Latex allergy should be taken into consideration if type I hypersensitivity reactions occur in occupational groups at risk for anaphylactic reaction...|$|R
40|$|Latex gloves are a {{frequent}} cause of complaints in dental staff, which complaints may start during the student education. The {{aim of the}} present study was to evaluate the prevalence of latex gloves-related complaints among dental students and to establish the etiology of these problems. Material and Methods: 122 dental students completed a questionnaire. Those with latex glove-related complaints were evaluated for latex sensitivity by assessment of skin prick test and for cell-mediated sensitivity to rubber additives and occupational hazards by assessment of patch test. Results: 8. 2 % of dental students had skin hand complaints wearing latex gloves. 3 of them (30 %) showed a positive skin prick to latex and 1 of them (10 %) showed a positive <b>patch</b> test to <b>rubber</b> additives. Conclusions: Dental students are at risk to develop occupational hypersensitivity although the limited exposure to latex gloves during education. Key words: allergy, dermatitis, latex gloves Dental practitioners who regularly use latex gloves are at increased risk for latex sensitivity (6, 10). They are also at risk for irritant or allergic contact dermatitis (8). There are three types of reactions to latex products: irritant contact dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, and immediate type I reaction (1, 3). Hand contact dermatitis in dental staff is a common occupational disorder (2, 5). It develops shortly after beginning the dental practice even during the education in dental schools (2, 10). The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the prevalence of latex gloves-related complaints among dental students in four year of their education and to establish the etiology of these problems...|$|R
