This approach can be useful to both general testing and regression testing after software maintenance and reengineering activities. Several strategies, including original algorithms, to move towards practical test data generation have been investigated in this paper. Methods include: ffl the analysis of minimum path-length partial execution trees for unconstrained arcs, thus increasing the generation performance and reducing the difficulties originated by infeasible paths ffl {{the reduction of the}} difficulties originated by nonlinear path conditions by considering alternative linear paths ffl the reduction of the number of test cases, which are needed to achieve the desired coverage, based on the concept of unconstrained arcs in a control flow graph ffl the extension of symbolic execution to deal with dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, pointers and pointers to functions Execution trees are symbolically executed to produce Extended Path Constraints (EPC), which are then partially mapped by an original algorithm into linear problems whose solutions correspond to the test data to be used as input to cover <b>program</b> <b>branches.</b> Partially mapping this problem into a linear optimization problem avoids infeasible and non-linear path problems, if a feasible linear alternate path exists in the same execution tree.

The framework is based on control flow graphs and applies to various procedural languages. In this framework, environments assigned to edges and nodes of control flow graphs are basically conjunctions of certain predicate formulas.

Using address traces captured from a SPARC-based computer system, the simulations show that the new prediction algorithm provides a significant improvement in the PRC performance.

40|$|Abstract. Power leakage {{constitutes}} an increasing {{fraction of the}} total power consumption in modern semiconductor technologies. Recent research efforts also indicate architecture, compiler, and software participations can help reduce the switching activities (also known as dynamic power) on microprocessors. This raises interests on the issues to employ architecture and compiler efforts to reduce leakage power (also known as static power) on microprocessors. In this paper, we investigate the compiler analysis techniques related to reducing leakage power. The architecture model in our design is a system with an instruction set to support the control of power gating in the component levels. Our compiler gives an analysis framework to utilize the instruction to reduce the leakage power. We present a data flow analysis framework to estimate the component activities at fixed points of programs with the consideration of pipelines of architectures. We also give the equation for the compiler to decide if the employment of the power gating instructions on given program blocks will benefit the total energy reductions. As the duration of power gating on components on given program routines is related to <b>program</b> <b>branches,</b> we propose a set of scheduling policy include Basic Blk Sched, MIN Path Sched, andAVG Path Sched mechanisms and evaluate the effectiveness of those schemes. Our experiment is done by incorporating our compiler analysis and scheduling policy into SUIF compiler tools [32] and by simulating the energy consumptions on Wattch toolkits [6]. Experimental results show our mechanisms are effective in reducing leakage powers on microprocessors. ...|$|E

The FPGAs being capable of implementing custom hardware blocks giving the advantage of ASICs, and allowing the implementation of processor platform are resulting in powerful Configurablesystem on chip(C-SoC) platforms. The Microchip’s PIC microcontroller is very widely used microcontroller architecture across various {{embedded systems}}. The implementation of such core on FPGA is very much useful in CSOC based embedded systems. This type of designs can be widely used in those controlling fields demanding low power consumption and high ratio of performance to price. In this project a {{reduced instruction set computer}} (RISC) CPU IP core whose instructions are compatible with the Microchip PIC 16 C 6 Xseries of microcontrollers is implemented in VHDL. The core is based on 8 -bit RISC architecture and top-Down design methodology is used in developing the core. The RISC CPU core is based on Harvard architecture with 14 -bit instruction length and 8 -bit data length and two-stage instruction pipeline. The architecture will be designed aiming at single cycle execution of the instructions, except those related to <b>program</b> <b>branches.</b> Since this type of CPU based on RISC architecture, there are only 35 reduced instructions in its instruction set, which are easy to be learned and used.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Software {{testing is}} of {{critical}} importance {{for the success of}} software projects. Current inefficient testing methods often still take up half or more of a software project's budget. Automatic test data generation is the most promising way to lower the software testing cost. Manually creating testing data is expensive and often needs deep domain knowledge. Therefore, both industry and academia are always highly interested in automatic approaches to generating test data. Symbolic execution {{has been one of the}} most promising and exciting areas of automated testing research for many years now. In principle, symbolic execution "runs" a program, replacing concrete inputs with symbolic variables that represent all possible values. When a <b>program</b> <b>branches,</b> the execution takes both paths (if they are feasible under current constraints) and a set of path conditions on symbolic variables is modified for each path to record the new constraints on the symbolic values. However, scaling symbolic execution to large programs or programs with complex inputs remains difficult due to path explosion and complex constraints, as well as external method calls. Additionally, creating an effective test structure with symbolic inputs can be difficult. A popular symbolic execution strategy in practice is to perform symbolic execution not "from scratch" but based on existing test cases. This dissertation explores the idea that the effectiveness of this approach to symbolic execution can be enhanced by (1) reducing the size of seed test cases, (2) prioritizing seed test cases to maximize exploration efficiency, and (3) selecting a subset tests for symbolic execution without specifying the number of tests. The proposed test case reduction strategy is based on a recently introduced generalization of delta-debugging, and our prioritization and selection techniques include novel methods that, for this purpose, can outperform some traditional regression testing algorithms. Our results show that applying these methods can significantly improve the effectiveness of symbolic execution based on existing test cases...|$|E

The {{study was conducted to}} determine the relationship of individuals who perceived they were making a significant contribution in volunteer work and their level of subjective morale. The number of hours, length of time, number of various jobs, and the use of a volunteer's skills, knowledge, and talents devoted to volunteer service are specifically identified as they relate to subjective morale. A pilot study was conducted on the telephone using 10 - 12 volunteers from a random sample of retired Ball State employees. These individuals were asked open-ended questions concerning several aspects of volunteering. Once the data was collected a Liekert questionnaire was developed using the common patterns noted in the volunteer's answers. The Liekert questionnaire was distributed to 50 volunteers, recruited from the Muncie, Indiana andthe New Castle, Indiana RSVP (The Retired Senior Volunteer <b>Program)</b> <b>branches.</b> The volunteers completed the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale: A Revision (PGC) and the Volunteer Attitude Questionnaire (VAQ). The results indicated no statistically significant relationship between volunteers who perceived they were making a significant contribution and their level of subjective morale. Likewise, the data indicated no statistically significant relationship between subjective morale and number of hours, length time, number of various jobs, and use of skills, knowledge, and talents devoted to volunteer services. The volunteers in the study reported a wide variety of subjective morale levels regardless of the factors examined in the study. It is apparent that older volunteers who perceived they were significantly contributing do not all develop increased morale.
