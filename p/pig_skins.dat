The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare the resemblance to human skin of four models commonly used to teach suturing: <b>pig</b> <b>skin,</b> beef tongue, hot dog and latex glove. METHODS: 5 centimeter biconvex incisions were made in each of the models and closed by 50 physician study volunteers comprised of 33 board-certified physicians and 17 resident physicians. They rated each model on a scale of 1 to 4, where 4 closely resembles human skin and 1 does not resemble human skin. RESULTS: The following mean ratings were given by study volunteers: beef tongue 3. 5 +/- 0. 5, <b>pig</b> <b>skin</b> 3. 2 +/- 0. 8, latex glove 1. 6 +/- 0. 7, hot dog 1. 4 +/- 0. 6.

Previous studies have characterised the mechanism of nerve agent toxicity in rodent models, however, it is generally accepted {{that one of the most}} appropriate animal models for human skin absorption is the domestic pig. The purpose of the present study was to measure and compare the skin absorption kinetics of VX in vitro using pig, human and guinea <b>pig</b> <b>skin</b> to highlight any potential species differences in skin permeability. When undiluted VX was applied directly to the skin, the permeability of guinea <b>pig</b> <b>skin</b> was approximately 7 -fold greater than human skin. There was no significant difference in the permeability of <b>pig</b> and human <b>skin.</b> When VX diluted with isopropyl alcohol was applied to the skin, the permeability of guinea <b>pig</b> <b>skin</b> was approximately 4 -fold greater than human skin.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of vehicles, enhancers, and polymer membranes on 3 -azido- 3 -deoxythymidine (AZT) permeation across cadaver <b>pig</b> <b>skin.</b> Four binary vehicles (ethanol/water, isopropyl alcohol/water, polyethylene glycol 400 /water, and ethanol/isopropyl myristate [IPM] were tested for AZT solubility and permeability across pig skin; ethanol/IPM (50 / 50, vol/vol) demonstrated the highest AZT flux (185. 23 μ/cm 2 /h). Next, the addition of various concentrations of different enhancers (N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone [NMP], oleic acid, and lauric acid) to different volume ratios of ethanol/IPM was investigated for their effect on AZT solubility and permeability across <b>pig</b> <b>skin.</b> The use of 2 conbinations (ethanol/IPM [20 / 80] plus 10 % NMP and ethanol/IPM [30 / 70] plus 10 % NMP) resulted in increased AZT solubility (42. 6 and 56. 27 mg/mL, respectively) and also high AZT flux values (284. 92 and 460. 34 μg/cm 2 /h, respectively) without appreciable changes in lag times (6. 25 and 7. 49 hours, respectively) when compared with formulations using only ethanol/IPM at 20 / 80 and 30 / 70 volume ratios without addition of the enhancer NMP. Finally, AZT permeation across <b>pig</b> <b>skin</b> covered with a microporous polyethylene (PE) membrane was investigated.

30|$|In {{comparison}} to mammal skin data, {{the skin of}} X. laevis was shown to be considerably more permeable to caffeine and testosterone. On average, 71.4  % (dorsal) to 87.5  % (ventral) of the applied dose of caffeine {{was found in the}} receptor fluid after 4  h. In an inter-laboratory data collection of human skin in vitro, mean measured percentages in receptor fluids ranged from 10.9 to 46.5  % of the applied dose after 24  h [28]. Although exposure time was 6 times higher, clearly less was absorbed through human skin compared to the skin of X. laevis. For testosterone, it was shown that on average 69.0  % (dorsal) to 84.8  % (ventral) of the applied dose was permeated across the skin of X. laevis after 8  h. The corresponding data shown by van de Sandt et al. [28] again demonstrate that after 24  h only 3.9 – 38.9  % of the applied dose of testosterone is permeated across human skin on average. For <b>pig</b> <b>skin</b> (dermatomed skin, 500 – 900  µm thick), data were found from static diffusion cell experiments, measured under conditions which are comparable to those of this study (the applied dose of caffeine and testosterone was 40  µg/cm 2, test compound vehicles were water for caffeine and ethanol for testosterone, and the receptor fluid was composed of a Ringer’s solution including 4.5  % BSA for testosterone) [29]. Mean permeability coefficients of <b>pig</b> <b>skin</b> derived from this study were 0.25  ×  10 − 4 cm/h and 0.20  ×  10 − 4 cm/h for caffeine and testosterone, respectively. Average maximum permeability coefficients of amphibian dorsal and ventral skin measured in our study were 37  ×  10 − 4 cm/h and 19  ×  10 − 4 cm/h for caffeine and testosterone, respectively. Thus, compared to <b>pig</b> <b>skin,</b> permeability of amphibian skin (X. laevis) is 148 - and 95 -fold greater to caffeine and testosterone, respectively. The magnitude of these differences between amphibian and <b>pig</b> <b>skin</b> corresponds to the results reported by Quaranta et al.

In order to determine whether there was calmodulin-like activity in <b>pig</b> <b>skin</b> epidermis and to see its relationship to epidermal phosphodiesterase, we used an established calmodulin deficient phosphodiesterase system prepared from bovine heart. Calmodulin deficient phosphodiesterase prepared from bovine heart was markedly stimulated by the addition of <b>pig</b> <b>skin</b> (epidermal) boiled extract in the presence of calcium. Boiled skin extract alone had only little phosphodiesterase activity by itself. This effect of boiled skin extract on bovine heart phosphodiesterase was inhibited by the addition of EGTA, a divalent metal ion chelator of relative Ca++ specificity. At a fixed concentration of EGTA, increasing the Ca++ concentration counteracted the effect of EGTA. Pure <b>pig</b> <b>skin</b> epidermis (separated by trypsinization, NaBr, CaCl 2 -sucrose or NH 4 Cl treatment) was also shown to have heat-stable calmodulin activity. In contrast to the bovine heart phosphodiesterase, epidermal phosphodiesterase was only partially inhibited when Ca++ was removed by EGTA. The addition of boiled skin extract on the crude extract of epidermal phosphodiesterase had minimal effect on the enzyme activity. Overall results indicate that although <b>pig</b> <b>skin</b> epidermis contains significant amount of calmodulin, the regulation of phosphodiesterase may not be the main biological activity of epidermal calmodulin...|$|R

40|$|A formal {{validation}} study was performed, {{in order to}} investigate whether the commercially available reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) models, EPISKIN (R), EpiDerm (TM) and SkinEthic (R), are suitable for in vitro skin absorption testing. The skin types currently recommended in the OECD Test Guideline 4 28, namely, ex vivo human epidermis and <b>pig</b> <b>skin,</b> were used as references. Based on the promising outcome of the prevalidation study, the panel of test substances was enlarged to nine substances, covering a wider spectrum of physicochemical properties. The substances were tested under both infinite-dose and finite-dose conditions, in ten laboratories, under strictly controlled conditions. The data were subjected to independent statistical analyses. Intra-laboratory and inter-laboratory variability contributed almost equally to the total variability, {{which was in the}} same range as that in preceding studies. In general, permeation of the RHE models exceeded that of human epidermis and <b>pig</b> <b>skin</b> (the SkinEthic RHE was found to be the most permeable), yet the ranking of substance permeation through the three tested RHE models and the <b>pig</b> <b>skin</b> reflected the permeation through human epidermis. in addition, both infinite-dose and finite-dose experiments are feasible with RHE models. The RHE models did not show the expected significantly better reproducibility, as compared to excised skin, despite a tendency toward lower variability of the data. Importantly, however, the permeation data showed a sufficient correlation between all the preparations examined. Thus, the RHE models, EPISKIN, EpiDerm and SkinEthic, are appropriate alternatives to human and <b>pig</b> <b>skin,</b> for the in vitro assessment of the permeation and penetration of substances when applied as aqueous solutions...|$|R

To document that donor proliferative characteristics are maintained in the grafts, a comparative analysis of agents that induce proliferation was made on skin of mice homozygous and heterozygous for nude, on <b>pig</b> <b>skin,</b> and on <b>pig</b> <b>skin</b> transplanted onto nude mice. A wave of epidermal proliferation could be induced in <b>pig</b> <b>skin</b> and <b>pig</b> <b>skin</b> grafted onto nude mice, but not in nude mouse skin after the topical application of 10 ng 12 -O- tetradecanoyl phorbol 13 -acetate (TPA). A 10 -fold greater concentration of TPA or 5 % croton oil induced proliferation in all species of epidermis studied. Mice, heterozygous for nude, showed a normal response to 10 ng TPA, suggesting that the ability to respond to TPA may be related, in part, to a recessive genetic trait. Nude mouse skin transplanted to a heterozygous littermate capable of responding to 10 ng TPA does not respond. These observations argue that: the graft retains its donor proliferative characteristics when transplanted to the nude, and the inability of the nude mouse to respond to lower doses of TPA may be related to absorption, the nude gene(s), or an inherent threshold to response. The lack of response to the promoter TPA provides a plausible explanation for the decreased incidence of tumors arising in nude mice during two-stage carcinogenesis experiments...|$|R
