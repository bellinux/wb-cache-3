Many newer washes use either cloth (which is not harmful to a car's finish, as long as it is flushed with plenty of water to remove the grit from previous washes) or a closed cell foam brush, which does not hold dirt or water, thus is far less likely to harm any painted finish.

30|$|At the Au film front, both {{polishing}} and {{pore formation}} occurred almost simultaneously for the highly doped Si. Maybe pore formation underneath the pillars is occurring even before polishing (Figure 2 d,f and Additional file 1 : Figure S 2 a,b). It is supposed that dopants serve as nucleation sites for pore formation, {{and the higher}} doping level leads to a larger thermodynamic driving force for pore formation in the p-type Si[15]. The charge supply (hole injection) {{is dependent on the}} concentration of H 2 O 2 by MaCE, as shown in Equation 1. In the λ 1, λ 2, and λ 3 solutions with relative higher charge supply, only a thin porous base layer is observed (Figure 2 f and Additional file 1 : Figure S 2 a,b), and the <b>polishing</b> <b>effect</b> is very strong (indicated by the long pillar length as seen Figure 8 b). The thickness of the thin porous base layer is not homogenous, and a thicker layer was generally observed underneath the pillars, where the local current density is smaller than that directly under the Au film. As the molar ratio λ increases to 0.92 (λ 4) with small H 2 O 2 concentration, thick porous base layers (Figure 3 d) under the Au film front were observed in the highly doped Si. The current density at the Au film front is reduced by the limited charge supply, and thereby, the polishing is depressed and the formation of pores under the Au film front becomes more active. This is also confirmed by the smaller pillar length compared with pillars etched in the λ 1, λ 2, and λ 3 solutions (as seen in Figure 8 b). A thick porous base layer was also observed under the Au film front after 3 -min etching in the λ 3 solution (Figure 2 a), while the thickness of the porous base layer is reduced with increasing etching time (Figure 2 d,f). The <b>polishing</b> <b>effect</b> becomes stronger after the first 3 -min etching (Figure 8 a). The initial weak <b>polishing</b> <b>effect</b> and the active formation of a thick porous base layer are probably due to the depressed charge transfer by the native SiO 2 layer and solid by-products of RIE between the Au film and the Si.|$|E

Among the valuable non-traditional finishing processes for generating super-smooth freeform surfaces that have been developed, the two-axis vibration assisted polishing process has attracted great attention from some scholars in recent years.

Precision polishing of micro structured mold {{has been}} highly demanded {{due to the}} increasing demand for optics manufacturing such as solar optics and DVD pick-up system, and medical devices like µ-TAS [1 - 5]. These micro structured molds usually have complicated structure {{and need to be}} polished after grinding or cutting.

The actuator consists of 3 multilayers-stacked piezoelectric actuators (PZT) incorporated with mechanical amplitude magnified mechanism. The mechanical amplitude magnified mechanism utilizes mechanical structures which is also called mechanical transformer, which is capable to elongate the stroke of the piezoelectric actuator to almost 13 times to 225 µm. By driving the PZT in sine wave with particular phase different, dual direction trajectory such as circle can be achieved, and is proved to be effective in precision mold polishing [8].
