5|$|The debate {{took all}} day, and the votes were counted very late that night. After the presentations, people {{voted for the}} {{continuation}} of the Viceroy, alone or {{at the head of a}} junta, or his dismissal. The ideas explained were divided into a small number of proposals, designated with the names of their main supporters, and the <b>people</b> <b>then</b> voted for one of those proposals. The voting lasted for a long time, and the result was to dismiss the Viceroy by a large majority: 155votes to69.|$|E
5|$|The {{same basic}} {{procedure}} {{was used by}} all of the above-mentioned psychologists. A participant makes a judgment about some particular issue. At a later time, they judge the same problem again but with information of how certain groups or prestigious people have evaluated the same problem. If the subject changes his judgment {{in the same direction as}} the evaluations of these groups of people or prestigious <b>people,</b> <b>then</b> this is considered a degree of influence that they have exerted on the participant's judgment.|$|E
5|$|In {{a sign of}} {{problems}} to come, three Spaniards passing through a region near the Peñol de Cerquín were attacked and killed. This area was considered pacified, and the attack deeply disturbed Montejo, since similar incidents during his conquest of Yucatán had been a prelude to general uprisings. He rushed {{to the scene of}} the attack with a strong force, and summoned all the native leaders to meet him, in an effort to forestall rebellion. He investigated the attack and meted out punishment to the most guilty, then continued with conciliatory policies towards the rest of the leaders, who reaffirmed their loyalty. Montejo let the leaders return to their <b>people,</b> <b>then</b> marched to Comayagua to reinforce Cáceres, before returning to Gracias a Dios.|$|E

5|$|Parts of Varanasi are {{contaminated}} with industrial chemicals including toxic heavy metal. Studies of wastewater from Varanasi's sewage treatment plants identify that water's contamination with metals and the reuse of this water for irrigation {{as a way}} that the toxic metals come to be in the plants that people grow for food. One studied example is palak, a popular leafy vegetable which takes up heavy metal when it is in the soil, and which <b>people</b> <b>then</b> eat. Some of the polluting sludge contains minerals which are fertiliser, which could make polluted water attractive to use. Pesticides used in local farming are persistent enough to be spread through the water, to sewer treatment, then back to the farms as wastewater.|$|E
5|$|Social wasps are {{considered}} pests {{when they become}} excessively common, or nest close to buildings. People are most often stung in late summer, when wasp colonies stop breeding new workers; the existing workers search for sugary foods {{and are more likely}} to come into contact with humans; if <b>people</b> <b>then</b> respond aggressively, the wasps sting. Wasp nests made in or near houses, such as in roof spaces, can present a danger as the wasps may sting if people come close to them. Stings are usually painful rather than dangerous, but in rare cases, people may suffer life-threatening anaphylactic shock.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, devices like a blink {{comparator}} {{were used}} in astronomy to detect objects in the Solar System, because these objects would move between two exposures—this involved time-consuming steps like exposing and developing photographic plates or films, and <b>people</b> <b>then</b> using a blink comparator to manually detect prospective objects. During the 1980s, the use of CCD-based cameras in telescopes {{made it possible to}} directly produce electronic images that could then be readily digitized and transferred to digital images. Because the CCD captured more light than film (about 90% versus 10% of incoming light) and the blinking could now be done at an adjustable computer screen, the surveys allowed for higher throughput. A flood of new discoveries was the result: over a thousand trans-Neptunian objects were detected between 1992 and 2006.|$|E

25|$|The {{styles and}} {{purposes}} of music vary greatly {{between and among}} each Native American tribe. However, a common concept amongst many indigenous groups is a conflation of music and power. For example, the Pima people feel many of their songs were given in the beginning and sung by the Creator. It was believed that some <b>people</b> <b>then</b> have more of an inclination to musical talent than others because of an individual's peculiar power.|$|E

25|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) has {{produced}} a six-stage classification that describes {{the process by which}} a novel influenza virus moves from the first few infections in humans through to a pandemic.

25|$|Counterfeits are {{put into}} {{circulation}} by dishonest <b>people,</b> <b>then</b> circulated inadvertently by others who are unaware; in many cases banks do not check, and circulate counterfeits. A 2011 BBC television programme withdrew 1,000 £1 coins from each of five major banks and found that each batch contained between 32 and 38 counterfeits; the Mint estimated that about 31 per 1,000 £1 coins were counterfeit. Some of the counterfeits were found by automated machinery, others could be detected only by expert visual inspection.|$|E

Bryant shot Janet Quin in the back, where she fell, unable to move, near Royce Thompson.|$|E
25|$|The {{wild horse}} race begins with untamed {{horses in the}} chutes. Teams of three <b>people</b> <b>then</b> run to the chutes and saddle the horses. One {{member of the group}} must then ride the horse across a finish line in the arena, ahead of any other riders. The wild bullock race is {{conducted}} in a similar manner to the wild horse race.

25|$|The Maharishi {{initiated}} {{thousands of}} <b>people,</b> <b>then</b> developed a TM teacher training {{program as a}} way to accelerate the rate of bringing the technique to more people. He also inaugurated a series of world tours which promoted Transcendental Meditation. These factors, coupled with endorsements by celebrities who practiced TM and claims that scientific research had validated the technique, helped to popularize TM in the 1960s and 1970s. By the late 2000s, TM had been taught to millions of individuals and the Maharishi was overseeing a large multinational movement. Despite organizational changes and the addition of advanced meditative techniques in the 1970s, the Transcendental Meditation technique has remained relatively unchanged.|$|E
