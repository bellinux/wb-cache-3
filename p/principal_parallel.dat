(I use the term "text type " as a neutral one which does not imply any specific theoretical stance.) The British National Corpus (Burnard, 1995) made an initial division into written texts and spoken ones (i. e. transcripts of recordings), and within each of these macrocategories, employed further categorisations and subcategorisations. For the spoken component, a first distinction was between "demographic " (conversations: 153 texts) versus "context-governed " (speech recorded in particular types of setting: 757 texts), and the "context-governed " component was further divided according {{to the nature of the}} setting (educational/informative; business; public/institutional; leisure: from 131 to 262 texts in each), paralleled by a monologue/dialogue distinction (40 %/ 60 %).

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the development of}} parallel algorithms to solve fractional differential equations using a numerical approach. The methodology adopted is to adapt existing numerical schemes and to develop prototype parallel programs using the MatLab Parallel Computing Toolbox (MPCT). The approach is to build on existing insights from parallel implementation of ordinary differential equations methods and to test a range of potential candidates for parallel implementation in the fractional case. As {{a consequence of the}} work, new insights on the use of MPCT for prototyping are presented, alongside conclusions and algorithms for the effective implementation of parallel methods for the fractional calculus. The <b>principal</b> <b>parallel</b> approaches considered in the work include: - A Runge-Kutta Method for Ordinary Differential Equations including the application of an adapted Richardson Extrapolation Scheme - An implementation of the Diethelm-Chern Algorithm for Fractional Differential Equations - A parallel version of the well-established Fractional Adams Method for Fractional Differential Equations - The adaptation for parallel implementation of Lubich's Fractional Multistep Method for Fractional Differential Equations An important aspect of the work is an improved understanding of the comparative diffi culty of using MPCT for obtaining fair comparisons of parallel implementation. We present details of experimental results which are not satisfactory, and we explain how the problems may be overcome to give meaningful experimental results. Therefore, an important aspect of the conclusions of this work is the advice for other users of MPCT who may be planning to use the package as a prototyping tool for parallel algorithm development: by understanding how implicit multithreading operates, controls can be put in place to allow like-for-like performance comparisons between sequential and parallel programs...|$|E

Clinical and Experimental Optometry © 2012 Optometrists Association AustraliaThe {{research}} outputs in {{this collection}} have been funded {{in whole or in}} part by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). In this paper, we review the path taken by signals originating from the short wavelength sensitive cones (S-cones) in Old World and New World primates. Two types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) carrying S-cone signals (blue-On and blue-Off cells) project to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) in the thalamus. In all primates, these S-cone signals are relayed through the 'dust-like' (konis in classical Greek) dLGN cells. In New World primates such as common marmoset, these very small cells are known to form distinct and spatially extensive, koniocellular layers. Although in Old World primates, such as macaques, koniocellular layers tend to be very thin, the adjacent parvocellular layers contain distinct koniocellular extensions. It appears that all S-cone signals are relayed through such konio cells, whether they are in the main koniocellular layers or in their colonies within the parvocellular layers of the dLGN. In the primary visual cortex, these signals begin to merge with the signals carried by the other two <b>principal</b> <b>parallel</b> channels, namely the magnocellular and parvocellular channels. This article will also review the possible routes taken by the S-cone signals to reach one of the topographically organised extrastriate visual cortical areas, the middle temporal area (area MT). This area is the major conduit for signals reaching the parietal cortex. Alternative visual inputs to area MT not relayed via the primary visual cortex area (V 1) may provide the neurological basis for the phenomenon of 'blindsight' observed in human and non-human primates, who have partial or complete damage to the primary visual cortex. Short wavelength sensitive cone (S-cone) signals to area MT may also play a role in directing visual attention with possible implications for understanding the pathology in dyslexia and some of its treatment options.

40|$|The {{chapter is}} premised on {{recognition}} {{that change is}} ongoing, discontinuous, and that responsiveness to change requires new and different forms of leadership in educational organisations. Parallel leadership is one such frame breaking concept. Parallel leadership is defined as 'a process whereby teacher leaders and their principal engage in collective action to build school capacity. It embodies three distinct qualities – mutual trust, shared purpose, and allowance for individual expression' (Crowther et al, 2002, p. 38). This conceptualisation unlocks the leadership potential for building the capacity to respond to change in schools. Parallel leadership is both powerful and challenging for principals. Teacher pedagogical leadership has been investigated in some detail (e. g.) {{and there has been}} some exploration of the metastrategic role of the principal (Crowther et al; 2001; Crowther & Andrews, 2004; Morgan, 2008). Such action includes aligning organisational elements, articulating shared direction and values, and networking beyond the school. Also crucial to the principal's role is the task of building leadership capacity within the professional community. This task includes enabling the growth of leadership skills and of the particular group of teachers within the school – a group that changes as staff come and go. There is both flexibility and fluidity implicit in this aspect of the work of the <b>principal</b> within <b>parallel</b> leadership [...] . As indicated in the definition above, teachers and their principal engage in collective action. What implications does this have for the <b>principal?</b> For <b>parallel</b> leadership to emerge, teachers leadership must be enabled. For collective action to be sustained, new ways of working must be developed for both the principal and the teachers. This is the area explored in detail in this chapter. Further insight will be provided through the exploration of the experiences of two principals who are working within the reality of parallel leadership. These cameos illustrates the power and the challenges of working in parallel with teachers – where there is shared purpose, trust and mutualism are valued and there is clearly allowance for individual expression. ...|$|R

The use of path models to explain exploratory factor analysis, speeds the learning curve in a subject that was previous dominated by matrix algebra (Loehlin, 1998).

The integration of factor analysis and measurement theory including item response theory (McDonald, 1985, 1999) is a breakthrough that will enable students to grasp the essentials of psychometric theory necessary for advanced study. The recognition that psychological constructs are often hierarchical in nature (Reise, Waller, & Comrey, 2000) is eminently reasonable and suggests that more attention needs to be given to hierarchical analysis.

40|$|Objective. To {{examine the}} effect of {{parallel}} trade on patterns of price dispersion for prescription drugs in the European Union. Data Sources. Longitudinal data from an IMSMidas database of prices and units sold for drugs in 36 categories in 30 countries from 1993 through 2004. Study Design. The main outcome measures were mean price differentials and other measures of price dispersion within European Union countries compared with within non-European Union countries. Data Collection/Extraction Methods. We identified drugs subject to parallel trade using information provided by IMS and by checkingmembership lists of parallel import trade associations and lists of approved <b>parallel</b> imports. <b>Principal</b> Findings. <b>Parallel</b> trade was not associated with substantial reductions in price dispersion in European Union countries. In descriptive and regression analyses, about half of the price differentials exceeded 50 percent in both European Union and non-European Union countries over time, and price distributions among European Union countries did not show a dramatic change concurrent with the adoption of parallel trade. In regression analysis, we found that although price differentials de-creased after 1995 in most countries, they decreased less in the European Union than elsewhere. Conclusions. Parallel trade for prescription drugs does not automatically reduce international price differences.
