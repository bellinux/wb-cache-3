30|$|In the LocVSDP {{protocol}} [3], the {{routing path}} established between a service requester and its correspondent service provider {{is the first}} path from which the elected leader has received the first request message or <b>parent</b> <b>message.</b> In our QoS and load balancing LocVSDP, this first path is not necessarily chosen. If the first path is congested, our load balancing and QoS-based protocol is able to generate an alternative path less congested than the first path {{in order to establish}} an efficient communication between the service provider and the service requester. In the following, we explain how our load balancing and QoS-based LocVSDP protocol generates the less congested path while propagating the service reply.|$|E
30|$|Questions {{and answers}} sparked many {{messages}} {{and more complex}} threads.

While both types of messages yielded direct responses (child messages), opinion-seeking messages more often generated rich threads, as evidenced by the high number of descendant messages (M[*]=  3.70, t(39)[*]=[*] 4.41, p[*]<[*] 0.001).|$|R
30|$|To {{discuss how}} {{messages}} are connected in conversations, we use genealogy terms {{to emphasize the}} nested and time-based nature of discussions. Any given message may have a <b>parent</b> <b>message(s)</b> to which it directly responds or child message(s) that directly respond to it. All messages connected upward from a node in a thread are ancestors, and all messages connected downward are descendants.

30|$|Figure 4 plots {{the load}} {{balancing}} on RRs in the vehicular network using the basic LocVSDP and the QoSLocVSDP respectively for 100 service requests. It shows mainly the used capacity of each RR in the simulated vehicular network. In the basic LocVSDP, almost 100 % of {{the capacity of}} RR 1 is used. The used capacity of the other RRs is less that 50 %. The reason behind this {{is that in the}} basic LocVSDP, the service reply returned to the service requester contains information about the fastest path to the service provider, i.e., the path from which the elected leader received the first request message or <b>parent</b> <b>message</b> as we explained earlier. Thus the basic LocVSDP, does not consider the load and the capacity of RRs in the choice of the routing path between the service provider and the service requester. On the other hand, in the QoSLocVSDP, the used capacity of all the RRs is less than 40 %. Thus, our proposed load balancing mechanism succeeds again in guaranteeing a balanced load on the RRs. In fact, in the QoSLocVSDP, a service reply is geocast to the service requester and the path retained for the communication between the service provider and the service requester is not necessarily the fastest path, but it is the less loaded path among the traversed routing paths in the geocast region between the service provider and the service requester. This explains the balanced capacity used in RRs 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11 located inside the geocast region.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a MAC-Iayer packet {{scheduling}} algorithm called BPA, for real-time switched Ethernet networks. BPA considers a message model where trans-node application-level messages have endto-end timeliness requirements that are specified using Jensen's benefit functions. The objective of BPA is to maximize the aggregate message-Ievel benefit. The algorithm reasons that this objective {{can be achieved by}} maximizing aggregate packet-level benefit, where packets of messages are allowed to inherit benefit functions of their <b>parent</b> <b>messages.</b> BP A thus solves a non-preemptive packet scheduling problem. Since this problem is NP-hard, BPA heuristically computes packet schedules to maximize aggregate benefit, incurring a worst-case computational complexity of O(n 2). This is better than the O(n 3) complexity of the previously known best algorithm (called CMA) for the same problem. Further, our experimental studies show that BPA performs as good as CMA for a broad set of benefit functions, and significantly outperforms CMA for some benefit functions. Furthermore, we observe that BPA yields lower missed-deadline ratio than CMA when message arrival density increases. 1...|$|R
40|$|For this thesis, I {{designed}} and implemented {{a system to}} summarize e-mail messages. The system exploits two aspects of e-mail, thread reply chains and commonly-found features, to generate summaries. The system uses existing software designed to summarize single text documents. Such software typically performs best on well-authored, formal documents. E-mail messages, however, are typically neither well-authored, nor formal. As a result, existing summarization software typically gives a poor summary of e-mail messages. To remedy this poor performance, the system's approach preprocesses e-mail messages to synthesize new input to this software, {{so that it will}} output more useful summaries of e-mail. This pre-processing involves a lightweight, heuristics-based approach to filtering e-mail to remove e-mail signatures, header fields, and quoted <b>parent</b> <b>messages.</b> I also present a heuristics-based approach to identifying and reporting names, dates, and companies found in e-mail messages.

30|$|In this phase, {{a leader}} is elected in the RI. When an RR RRi {{receives}} a QoSReq message, it generates a QoS-based election (QoSElec) message and broadcasts {{it inside the}} RI. Every RR that receives a QoSElec message generates its own election message and broadcasts it to its neighbors inside RI. In the QoSElec message, the RR RRi adds its distance {{to the center of}} RI. If RRi has been elected as leader for another QoS-based service request, it adds the radius of RI to the distance to RI and sends it in the QoSElec message, such that it will not be elected as leader again until all RRs inside RI have been elected at least once as leaders. After the exchange of QoSElec messages between RRs inside RI, every RR chooses its parent in the RI as the RR that has the smallest value of the distance to the origin of RI. After the exchange of <b>parent</b> <b>messages</b> a spanning tree inside the RI is constructed. The root of the spanning is elected as leader. QoS-based local reply (QoSLocalRep) messages are sent by every RR to its parent in the spanning tree. A QoSLocalRep message includes all the service providers that satisfy the QoS-based service request sent by the service requester. The leader RR will receive the information about all the service providers inside the desired RI that satisfy the requester. At this stage, it generates the QoS-based reply message that will be propagated to the service requester.|$|R
40|$|Within {{a public}} health {{approach}} to improving parenting, the mass media offer a potentially more efficient and affordable format for directly reaching {{a large number of}} parents with evidence-based parenting information than do traditional approaches to parenting interventions that require delivery by a practitioner. Little is known, however, about factors associated with parents’ interest in and willingness to watch video <b>messages</b> about <b>parenting.</b> Knowledge of consumer preferences could inform the effective design of media interventions to maximize parental engagement in the <b>parenting</b> <b>messages.</b> This study examined parents’ preferred formats for receiving parenting information, as well as family sociodemographic and child behavior factors that predict parents’ ratings of acceptability of a media-based parenting intervention. An ethnically diverse sample of 162 parents of children ages 3 – 6 years reported their preferences for various delivery formats for parenting information and provided feedback on a prototype episode of a video-format parenting program based on the Triple P Positive Parenting Program. Parents reported the strongest preference for self-administered delivery formats such as television, online programs, and written materials; the least preferred formats were home visits, therapists, and multiweek parenting groups. Parents’ ratings of engagement, watchability, and realism of the prototype parenting episode were quite strong. Parents whose children exhibited clinical levels of problem behaviors rated the episode as more watchable, engaging, and realistic. Mothers also rated the episodes as more engaging and realistic than did fathers. Lower income marginally predicted higher watchability ratings. Minority status and expectations of future problems did not predict acceptability ratings. The results suggest that the episode had broad appeal across groups...|$|R
40|$|Background: This study {{investigated}} whether providing self-directed and web-based support for parents enhanced {{the effects of}} viewing a reality television series based on the Triple P - Positive Parenting Programme. Method: Parents with a child aged 2 to 9 (N = 454) {{were randomly assigned to}} either a standard or enhanced intervention condition. In the standard television alone viewing condition, parents watched the six-episode weekly television series, 2 ̆ 7 Driving Mum and Dad Mad 2 ̆ 7. Parents in the enhanced television viewing condition received a self-help workbook, extra web support involving downloadable parenting tip sheets, audio and video streaming of positive <b>parenting</b> <b>messages</b> and email support, in addition to viewing the television series. Results: Parents in both conditions reported significant improvements in their child 2 ̆ 7 s disruptive behaviour and improvements in dysfunctional parenting practices. Effects were greater for the enhanced condition as seen on the ECBI, two of the three parenting indicators and overall programme satisfaction. However, no significant differences were seen on other measures, including parent affect indicators. The level of improvement was related to number of episodes watched, with greatest changes occurring in families who watched each episode. Improvements achieved at post-intervention by parents in both groups were maintained at six-month follow-up. Online tip sheets were frequently accessed; uptake of web-based resources was highest early in the series. Conclusions: The value of combining self-help approaches, technology and media as part of a comprehensive public health approach to providing parenting support is discussed...|$|R

Psychosocial correlates (Sensation Seeking, peer behaviour, parent behaviour, and peer and <b>parent</b> anti-substance use <b>messages)</b> from three domains of influence (personality, parent, and peer) were examined together to provide a greater context for the occurrence of such health-risk behaviours. The strongest predictor(s) of each behaviour were identified to better inform intervention practices. Three groups were compared— 1) those who never tried substances, 2) those who tried substances in the past, and 3) those who continue to use substances at present, in a population of emerging adults. Self-report data was gathered from 203 Collèges d'Enseignement Général Et Professionnel (CEGEP) students in the Montreal region. Measures included: Reckless Behaviour Questionnaire, Reckless Driving Measure, Health Behaviour Survey, Sensation Seeking Scale—Form V, and the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale. Results revealed that peer behaviour was the most significant predictor of substance use in emerging adults, whereas parent behaviour was only a significant predictor of reckless driving. Sensation Seeking, specifically Disinhibition, was found to predict more global reckless behaviours, including illegal activities, such as stealing or using marijuana (p <. 01).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relations among adolescent perceived racial socialization messages and mother transmitted messages {{in a sample}} of African American mothers and their children. It first examined the size and direction {{of the relationship between the}} two perspectives of racial socialization. The findings indicate that, although adolescent and <b>parent</b> socialization <b>messages</b> are related, there are substantial differences between the two perspectives. However, the size of the relationship differed across the socialization messages. Mothers and adolescents were more likely to agree on the indirect <b>messages</b> <b>parents</b> send through their actions (r = 0. 35) than they were to agree on the direct verbal <b>messages</b> that <b>parents</b> use. The next set of analysis explored the ways in which adolescent, maternal, and family characteristics shaped the relationship between adolescent and maternal views of racial socialization messages and practices. These analyses demonstrated that adolescent gender, maternal education, and family structure affected the relationship between adolescent and maternal reports of behavioral socialization practices. Mother-daughter dyads had higher congruence on behavioral socialization than mother-son dyads. Dyads headed by married mothers had higher congruence than those headed by unmarried mothers. College-educated mothers had higher levels of congruence with their adolescent children than non-college educated mothers. The last set of analyses explored the relation between racial socialization and racial identity over time. Overall, adolescents’ perceptions of racial socialization were better predictors of their later racial identity than their mothers’ reports of socialization. For example, mother transmitted egalitarian messages were significant predictors of children’s public regard. However, adolescent perceived egalitarian messages did not share a similar relationship with adolescent public regard. Instead, public regard was related to adolescent perceived behavioral socialization. These findings, together with findings from the other two research questions, demonstrate the uniqueness of the two perspectives of racial socialization messages and practices and the necessity to further explore the reasons behind the discrepancies between adolescents and parents...|$|R
