2500|$|El Señor Presidente uses surrealistic {{techniques}} and reflects Asturias' notion that Indian's non-rational awareness of reality {{is an expression}} of subconscious forces. Although the author never specifies where the novel takes place, {{it is clear that the}} plot is influenced by Guatemalan president, and well-known dictator, Manuel Estrada Cabrera's rule. Asturias's novel examines how evil spreads downward from a powerful political leader, into the streets and homes of the citizens. Many themes, such as justice and love, are mocked in the novel, and escape from the dictator's tyranny is seemingly impossible. Each character within the novel is deeply affected by the dictatorship and must struggle to survive in a terrifying reality. The story opens with the accidental murder of a high official, Colonel Parrales Sonriente. The President uses the Colonel's death to dispose of two men as he decides to frame them both for the murder. The tactics of the President are often viewed as sadistic, as he believes his word is the law which no one shall question. The novel then travels with several characters, some close to the President and some seeking escape from his regime. The dictator's trusted adviser, whom the reader knows as [...] "Angel Face", falls in love with a General Canales's daughter, Camila. Also, Angel Face, under the direct order of the President, convinces General Canales that immediate flight is imperative. Unfortunately, the General is one of the two men the <b>President</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to frame for murder; the President's plan to make General Canales appear guilty is to have him shot while fleeing. The General is hunted for execution while his daughter is held under house arrest by Angel Face. Angel Face is torn between his love for her and his duty to the President. While the Dictator is never named, he has striking similarities to Manuel Estrada Cabrera.|$|E

Donovan hopes the assets of the airline will be available for OSS use; Cletus Frade suspects the <b>President</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to put pressure on Pan American-Grace Airways, which has a near monopoly on South American air travel. He nevertheless is able to form the airline in relatively short order, but staffs it with Argentine pilots and staff under pressure from the Argentine government, which makes it unlikely to be usable by the OSS.|$|E

Cotton also seemed to underestimate what military action against Iran would entail, stating: [...] "the <b>president</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to make {{you think it would}} be 150,000 heavy mechanized troops on the ground in the Middle East again as we saw in Iraq. That's simply not the case." [...] Drawing a comparison to President Bill Clinton's actions in 1998 during Operation Desert Fox, he elaborated: [...] "Several days' air and naval bombing against Iraq's weapons of mass destruction facilities for exactly the same kind of behavior. For interfering with weapons inspectors and for disobeying Security Council resolutions." ...|$|E
50|$|Hacker, seeking {{revenge on}} the President for {{shutting}} down his business, uses {{a software program}} ("Hacker Hellstorm") to activate missile silos across the country. The President learns that the signal causing the activation of the silos originated from Canada, and summons Hacker. Hacker offers to sell a program to the President that can cancel out the Hellstorm — for $1 trillion. With only six minutes left, the <b>President</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to figure out what's going on. Stuart, {{fed up with the}} President being too busy to give Hacker the money, realizes that Hacker, getting up to leave, is the one controlling the silos, not Canada, and, after storming up, takes the operating codes from him required to stop the Hellstorm (accidentally killing Hacker in the process). The President orders Stuart's arrest, despite his protests that he is now able to give the codes to the President so they could deactivate the missiles which are aimed at Moscow. As the launch time approaches the President pleads with Canadian Prime Minister Clark MacDonald (Wallace Shawn) over the phone to stop the launch.|$|E

40|$|A trans-Atlantic {{panel of}} social {{scientists}} addresses {{the question of}} what social science might offer the new President of the United States in various areas of policy and government action. Andrew Rudalevige's analysis of the scholarship on managing the presidency leads him to state that 'most of the major happenings of the Bush years were essentially administrative in nature. That is likely to continue. Thus, how and whether presidents achieve the sort of advice and responsiveness they desire from the bureaucracy has important implications not only for the kinds of policy the government implements, but for assessing democratic governance itself'. George Edwards examines presidential strategies for government with the conclusion that 'Social science shows us that there is no silver bullet' when a <b>president</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to obtain the support of the public or Congress. Jenel Virden points out that in 2008 women turned out to vote more than men, voted for Obama more than men, and were strongly hopeful that under the new administration prospects would improve. Having engaged so successfully with this sector of the population, the Obama administration is under pressure to recognize and address its needs. Robert Singh points out that there are necessary reservations about the utility of social science in informing an Obama foreign policy, but nonetheless elaborates propositions and principles that could usefully frame the administration's approach. Dilys Hill provides an overview and draws the debate to a close. The discussion in these pages is based on the 2009 Academy of Social Sciences annual debate, convened by Philip Davies and hosted by the Eccles Centre for American Studies at the British Library (Davies et al, 2009) ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how {{the leadership of}} the European Union has developed over the years and what has caused these changes. The Commission and the Council will be the compared objects for this analysis. The institutions are delegated unique powers in the executive politics but {{the leadership of the}} Union is formally largely unregulated, and is often described as shared between the two institutions. This balance has tilted {{back and forth over the}} history of the EU which has periodically raised the matter of a leadership deficit in the Union, not least in present time. Upcoming reforms, with a permanent <b>President,</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to overcome this disadvantage. By conceptualising leadership, facilitated by established international relations theory, it will be shown that this deficit is only partly true. Instead there is substantial evidence revealing that the roles of the institutions have shifted.
