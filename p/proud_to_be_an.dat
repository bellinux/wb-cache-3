He was imprisoned for 13 days and tortured several times, before being released on bail; he faced life imprisonment for disbelief in God. Sherwan tried to contact the media for seven months, but all refused to run his story until the private newspaper Awene published it in May 2014. It went viral, and human rights activists came to his aid.|$|E

500|$|The {{candidates}} {{waved at}} the crowd of 3,000 which had come to meet the plane, and rode together, with Nixon in place of honor, to a rally at City Island Stadium as Eisenhower chatted to Nixon as if the crisis had never occurred. At the stadium, Eisenhower introduced Nixon as a [...] "colleague" [...] who had been subject to [...] "a vicious and unprincipled attack" [...] but who had [...] "vindicated himself" [...] and who [...] "stood higher than ever before". The presidential candidate finished by reading two telegrams, one from Nixon's mother assuring the general of her son's integrity, and the second from Summerfield stating that the RNC had voted unanimously to retain Nixon on the ticket. Nixon then spoke, telling the crowd that {{this was one of}} two moments when he was most <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> American; the other had been at the victory parade in New York in 1945, when he had seen General Eisenhower go by. He called the Wheeling rally [...] "the greatest moment of my life".|$|E
500|$|Frusciante {{developed}} serious drug habits while touring {{with the}} band during the previous four years. He {{said that when he}} [...] "found out that Flea was stoned out of his mind at every show, that inspired me to be a pothead". Not only was Frusciante smoking large amounts of marijuana, but he began to use heroin and {{was on the verge of}} full-scale addiction. Upon returning to California in the summer of 1992, Frusciante entered a deep depression, feeling that his life was over and that he could no longer write music or play guitar. For a long time, he focused on painting, producing 4-track recordings he had made while working on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and writing short stories and screenplays. To cope with his worsening depression, Frusciante increased his heroin use and spiraled into a life-threatening dependency. His use of heroin to medicate his depression was a clear decision: [...] "I was very sad, and I was always happy when I was on drugs; therefore, I should be on drugs all the time. I was never guilty—I was always really <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> addict." [...] Frusciante openly admitted to being a [...] "junkie", believing that drugs were the only way of [...] "making sure you stay in touch with beauty instead of letting the ugliness of the world corrupt your soul." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Grande drew {{criticism}} for allegedly impolite interactions with reporters and fans in 2014, she dismissed these reports as [...] "weird, inaccurate depictions".

Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "Some may cry 'diva', but it's also Grande just taking a stand to not allow others to control her image." [...] In July 2015, Grande was seen on surveillance video in a doughnut shop licking doughnuts that were on display and saying [...] "I hate Americans. I hate America. This is disgusting", referring to a tray of doughnuts. She apologized, writing that she is [...] "extremely <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> American" [...] and that her comments related to American obesity. She later released a video apology for [...] "behaving poorly". The incident was parodied by The Muppets and featured in Miley Cyrus' Saturday Night Live cover of [...] "My Way", about the regrets of the summer of 2015. Grande mocked the incident herself on Saturday Night Live in 2016, saying [...] "A lot of kid stars end up doing drugs, or in jail, or pregnant, or get caught looking at a doughnut they didn't pay for." ...|$|E

60|$|Gran'pa Jim was {{the only}} {{relative}} she had {{in all the world}} and she loved him devotedly. Their life in the pretty little town had been peaceful and happy until recently--until the war. But the old Colonel, loyal veteran that he was, promptly made it his war and was roused as Mary Louise had never seen him roused before. In his mind was no question of the justice of our country's participation in the world struggle; he was <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> American and gloried in America's sacrifice to the cause of humanity. Too old to fight on the battlefield, he felt honored at his appointment to the membership of the Liberty Bond Committee and threw all his energies into the task assigned him. So it is easy to understand that the coldness and reluctance to subscribe for bonds on the part of his fellow townsmen had well nigh broken his heart.|$|E
60|$|But {{when the}} great ship entered the English Channel, Alec could {{scarcely}} bear his impatience. It would have astonished those who thought him unhuman if they had known the tumultuous emotions that rent his soul. His fellow-passengers never suspected that the bronzed, silent man who sought to make no acquaintance, was the explorer with whose name all Europe was ringing; and {{it never occurred to}} them that as he stood in the bow of the ship, straining his eyes for the first sight of England, his heart was so full that he would not have dared to speak. Each absence had intensified his love for that sea-girt land, and his eyes filled with tears of longing as he thought that soon now he would see it once more. He loved the murky waters of the English Channel because they bathed its shores, and he loved the strong west wind. The west wind seemed to him the English wind; it was the trusty wind of seafaring men, and he lifted his face to taste its salt buoyancy. He could not think of the white cliffs of England without a deep emotion; and when they passed the English ships, tramps outward bound or stout brigantines driving before the wind with their spreading sails, he saw the three-deckers of Trafalgar and the proud galleons of the Elizabethans. He felt a personal pride in those dead adventurers who were spiritual ancestors of his, and he was <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> Englishman because Frobisher and Effingham were English, and Drake and Raleigh and the glorious Nelson.|$|E
