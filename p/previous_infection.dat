5|$|There are {{two types}} of herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-1 more {{commonly}} causes infections around the mouth while HSV-2 more commonly causes genital infections. They are transmitted by direct contact with body fluids or lesions of an infected individual. Transmission may still occur when symptoms are not present. Genital herpes is classified as a sexually transmitted infection. It may be spread to an infant during childbirth. After infection, the viruses are transported along sensory nerves to the nerve cell bodies, where they reside lifelong. Causes of recurrence may include: decreased immune function, stress, and sunlight exposure. Oral and genital herpes is usually diagnosed based on the presenting symptoms. The diagnosis may be confirmed by viral culture or detecting herpes DNA in fluid from blisters. Testing the blood for antibodies against the virus can confirm a <b>previous</b> <b>infection</b> but will be negative in new infections.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Comparison {{was made}} between the {{parasite}}mia of Chesson strain Plasmodium vivax in humans and in splenectomized Aotus lemurinus griseimembra, A. nancymaae, A. vociferans, and A. azarae boliviensis monkeys. In the monkeys, 56. 3 % of the animals had maximum counts> 25, 000 /µL and in humans 59. 6 % were above this peak parasitemia. In humans, it took an average of 9. 3 days to reach the maximum parasite count. In monkeys with no <b>previous</b> <b>infections,</b> it took an average of 18. 9 days to reach the maximum parasite count; for those with <b>previous</b> <b>infections,</b> it took an average of 15 days.

25|$|Most {{people become}} {{infected}} with EBV and gain adaptive immunity. In the United States, {{about half of}} all five-year-old children and about 90 percent of adults have evidence of <b>previous</b> <b>infection.</b> Infants become susceptible to EBV as soon as maternal antibody protection disappears. Many children become infected with EBV, and these infections usually cause no symptoms or are indistinguishable from the other mild, brief illnesses of childhood. In the United States and other developed countries, many people are not infected with EBV in their childhood years. When infection with EBV occurs during adolescence, it causes infectious mononucleosis 35 to 50 percent of the time.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} {{focuses on}} targeting two stages {{in the development of}} the worm: the larval stage and the adult stage. Research on larval antigens has focused on proteins that are members of the pathogenesis-related protein superfamily, Ancylostoma Secreted Proteins. Although they were first described in Anyclostoma, these proteins have also been successfully isolated from the secreted product of N. americanus. N. americanus ASP-2 (Na-ASP-2) is currently the leading larval-stage hookworm vaccine candidate. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study has already been performed; 36 healthy adults without a history of hookworm infection were given three intramuscular injections of three different concentrations of Na-ASP-2 and observed for six months after the final vaccination. The vaccine induced significant anti-Na-ASP-2 IgG and cellular immune responses. In addition, it was safe and produced no debilitating side effects. The vaccine is now in a phase one trial; healthy adult volunteers with documented evidence of <b>previous</b> <b>infection</b> in Brazil are being given the same dose concentration on the same schedule used in the initial study. If this study is successful, the next step would be to conduct a phase two trial to assess the rate and intensity of hookworm infection among vaccinated persons. Because the Na-ASP-2 vaccine only targets the larval stage, it is critical that all subjects enrolled in the study be treated with antihelminthic drugs to eliminate adult worms prior to vaccination.|$|E

2500|$|Research {{suggests}} that <b>previous</b> <b>infections</b> may provoke the autoimmune responses present in Behçet's disease. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) {{are present in}} some bacteria {{and serve as a}} [...] "danger signal" [...] to the immune system. However, some HSPs share a similarity in bacteria and humans. The anti-HSP60 and anti-HSP65 antibodies that target HSPs produced by Streptococci (including S. sanguinis and S. pyogenes) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis can also target human HSPs, leading to immune responses linked to uveitis and various symptoms shown in parenchymal neuro-Behçet's disease.|$|R
500|$|Humans {{and higher}} {{primates}} also produce [...] "natural antibodies" [...] that {{are present in}} serum before viral infection. Natural antibodies have been defined as antibodies that are produced without any <b>previous</b> <b>infection,</b> vaccination, other foreign antigen exposure or passive immunization. These antibodies can activate the classical complement pathway leading to lysis of enveloped virus particles long before the adaptive immune response is activated. Many natural antibodies are directed against the disaccharide galactose α(1,3)-galactose (α-Gal), which is found as a terminal sugar on glycosylated cell surface proteins, and generated in response to production of this sugar by bacteria contained in the human gut. Rejection of xenotransplantated organs is thought to be, in part, the result of natural antibodies circulating in the serum of the recipient binding to α-Gal antigens expressed on the donor tissue.|$|E

50|$|In brief, {{the crucial}} role of C1q in the pathway is its {{importance}} as the first protein to start the complement cascade (which ends {{in the destruction of}} the invading bacteria or virus), and its ability to link the two important arms of the immune system - the innate immune system: a broad defence system; and the adaptive immune system: the strong immune response capable of remembering <b>previous</b> <b>infections,</b> allowing fast response against recurrent infections, meaning that people with a normal immune system don't continually catch the same cold or same strain of flu repeatedly.|$|R

2500|$|Fecal bacteriotherapy {{involves}} {{the infusion of}} human probiotics through fecal enemas. Ulcerative colitis typically requires a more prolonged bacteriotherapy treatment than Clostridium difficile infection to be successful, possibly due to {{the time needed to}} heal the ulcerated epithelium. The response of ulcerative colitis is potentially very favorable with one study reporting 67.7% of sufferers experiencing complete remission. It suggests that the cause of ulcerative colitis may be a <b>previous</b> <b>infection</b> by a still unknown pathogen. This initial infection resolves itself naturally, but somehow causes an imbalance in the colonic bacterial flora, leading to a cycle of inflammation which can be broken by [...] "recolonizing" [...] the colon with bacteria from a healthy bowel.

2500|$|Natural {{immunity}} from maternal antibodies lasts in the kitten {{from three to}} nine weeks. [...] After that, kittens are susceptible to FCV. [...] <b>Previous</b> <b>infection</b> does not guarantee lifelong immunity, since an antigenically dissimilar FCV (such as VS-FCV) can cause infection. [...] However, usually {{after the age of}} three years, FCV infections are mild or asymptomatic. [...] FCV vaccination will not always prevent disease, but can reduce the severity. [...] FCV vaccines come in two types, inactivated (ATCvet code: [...] ) and attenuated (live, but not virulent; in various combination vaccines). [...] They {{have been shown to be}} effective for at least three years. [...] Attenuated FCV vaccine has been shown to possibly cause mild upper respiratory infection. Inactivated vaccine does not, but it causes more local inflammation and possibly predisposes the cat to vaccine-associated sarcoma. [...] The only vaccine licensed for prevention of VS-FCV is CaliciVax, manufactured by Fort Dodge Animal Health, a division of Wyeth. [...] It also contains a strain of the traditional FCV virus. [...] Since VS-FCV has arisen from variant strains of FCV, it is not certain that a vaccine for one virulent strain will protect against all virulent strains.|$|E
40|$|Repeated infections with Neisseria gonorrhoeae {{are common}} among {{patients}} attending {{sexually transmitted disease}} clinics. We examined whether <b>previous</b> <b>infections</b> or site of infection altered the local and systemic antigonococcal antibody levels in males and females. Antibodies against N. gonorrhoeae MS 11 and the patients’ homologous infecting isolates were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In general, the local and systemic immune responses to gonococci were extremely modest. There was {{a slight increase in}} serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) against the MS 11 strain and the homologous isolates in infected males. Levels of serum IgA 1 antibodies against MS 11 were slightly higher in infected than in uninfected females. A history of <b>previous</b> <b>infections</b> with N. gonorrhoeae did not alter the antibody levels in patients with a current infection, suggesting that immunological memory is not induced by uncomplicated gonococcal infections. Antibody responses to infected subjects’ homologous isolates were observed in cervical mucus; IgA 1 levels increased while IgG levels decreased. The decline in mucosal IgG against the homologous isolates was less common in subjects having both rectal and cervical infections; otherwise, no effect of rectal involvement was observed. The absence of substantially higher antibody levels to gonococci where there is infection at a site known to contain organized lymphoid tissue suggests that the low levels of responses to uncomplicated infections may not be due simply to an absence of inductive sites in the genital tract. We propose that in addition to its potential ability to avoid the effects of an immune response, N. gonorrhoeae does not elicit strong humoral immune responses during uncomplicated genital infections...|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectivesTo {{estimate}} {{the impact of}} immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) on morbidity and mortality in patients starting highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). MethodsA retrospective cohort study of HIV-positive patients starting HAART was conducted at a tertiary care referral center in Mexico City. We estimated the incidence of IRIS, hospitalizations and death rates during the first 2 years of HAART. The relative risk of death (RR) and hospitalization for patients with IRIS were adjusted for relevant covariates using regression methods. ResultsDuring the 2 -year follow-up period, 27 % of patients developed IRIS (14 IRIS cases per 100 person-years). The relative risk of death among patients who developed IRIS was 3 times higher (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 19 – 7. 65, p = 0. 03). After adjusting for <b>previous</b> opportunistic <b>infections</b> we still observed a higher death rate among patients with IRIS (RR 2. 3, 95 % CI 0. 9 – 5. 9, p= 0. 09).
