25|$|The {{standard}} igloo design {{resulted from}} a need for lightweight <b>prefabricated</b> <b>structures</b> which could be quickly erected as aircraft hideouts, or shelters in more remote areas. It has been assumed that the timber lattice arch truss design was based on American steel lattice structures. However, Emil Brizay, a French engineer refugee from Singapore {{in the office of}} MR Hornibrook is also credited with designing the construction system on which the igloo was modelled. The igloos at Eagle Farm were one of several designs for lightweight long span structures which utilised timber in small sectional sizes of chords to enable the lattice trusses to be hand nailed in jigs on site and speedily erected at low cost.|$|E

Initially, teaching took place in the temporary [...] "University Village". Sited on the opposite side of the Earlham Road to the present campus, this was a collection of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>structures</b> designed for 1200 students, laid out by the local architectural firm Feilden and Mawson.

50|$|Specialized expositions {{are usually}} smaller in scale and cheaper {{to run for}} the host {{committee}} and participants because the architectural fees are lower and they only have to rent the space from the host committee, usually with the <b>prefabricated</b> <b>structure</b> already completed. Countries then have the option of 'adding' their own colours, design etc. to the outside of the <b>prefabricated</b> <b>structure</b> and filling in the inside with their own content. One example of this is China, which has often chosen to add a Chinese archway in the front of its prefabricated pavilions to symbolize the nation (Expo '88, Expo '92, Expo '93).|$|R

This <b>prefabricated</b> <b>structure</b> is made of a steel frame which is completely filled with soil and a face made of tree trunks among which scions or autochthonous bushes are planted. Due to the difficulties in interpreting the complex interaction between soil and structure during the installation and lifetime, an in situ test was carried out in order to evaluate the state of stress in the steel frame and to understand the global behavior of the structure under service loads. On the basis of the obtained results, a procedure for checking the structure safety was proposed and discussed. An easy design method was developed during the research. Moreover, the use of this type of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>structure</b> shows several advantages, such as good performances in terms of stabilizing effects, and easy assembly and transport...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis article {{deals with}} the {{proposal}} of a stone <b>prefabricated</b> <b>structure.</b> Today, prefabrication promises convenience when applied to the construction industry, in terms of project costs abatement, ecology and final results quality. Notwithstanding, it implies some technological expedients that cannot be overlooked {{and that should be}} solved with an accurate engineering effort. Furthermore, freestone manifests qualities related to sustainable development, durability and aesthetic that lead us to want to extend this material use in contemporary architecture. Our proposal combines these issues. We present a design description of a sandwich structure in dimension stone and an analysis of its mechanical behavior that could confirm it responds positively to all the typical loading conditions of a <b>prefabricated</b> <b>structure.</b> In conclusion, we also report a record of a first constructive experimentation performed on this type of structure as a further confirmation of its efficacy...|$|R
