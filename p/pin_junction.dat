Each micro-junction can switch in time between two states: A pinned state characterized by a displacement-dependent force, and a slipping state characterized by a time-dependent force. Instead of tracking each micro-junction individually, the state of the interface is described by two coupled distributions for (i) the stretching of <b>pinned</b> <b>junctions</b> and (ii) the time spent in the slipping state.

As the framework allows for a whole family of micro-junction behaviour laws, we show how these laws can be chosen to obtain monotonic (strengthening or weakening) or non-monotonic velocity dependence at the macroscale. By then considering transient situations, we predict that the macroscopic static friction coefficient is strongly influenced by the way the interface was prepared, in particular by the slip dynamics of the previous sliding event.

40|$|To {{study how}} {{macroscopic}} friction phenomena originate from microscopic junction laws, we introduce a general statistical framework describing the collective {{behavior of a}} large number of individual microjunctions forming a macroscopic frictional interface.

Instead of tracking each microjunction individually, the state of the interface is described by two coupled distributions for (i) the stretching of <b>pinned</b> <b>junctions</b> and (ii) the time spent in the slipping state. This framework allows for a whole family of microjunction behavior laws, and we show how it represents an overarching structure for many existing models found in the friction literature. We then use this framework to pinpoint the effects of the time scale that controls the duration of the slipping state. First, we show that the model reproduces a series of friction phenomena already observed experimentally. The macroscopic steady-state friction force is velocity dependent, either monotonic (strengthening or weakening) or nonmonotonic (weakening-strengthening), depending on the microscopic behavior of individual junctions. In addition, slow slip, which has been reported in a wide variety of systems, spontaneously occurs in the model if the friction contribution from junctions in the slipping state is time weakening. Next, we show that the model predicts a nontrivial history dependence of the macroscopic static friction force. In particular, the static friction coefficient at the onset of sliding is shown to increase with increasing deceleration during the final phases of the preceding sliding event. We suggest that this form of history dependence of static friction should be investigated in experiments, and we provide the acceleration range in which this effect is expected to be experimentally observable...|$|R

The results show that the conversion efficiency of GaAs nanowires can be greatly enhanced by using AlGaAs for the p segment instead of GaAs. A maximum efficiency enhancement of 8.42 % has been achieved in this study. And for axial nanowire, by using AlGaAs for the top p segment, a relatively long top segment can be employed without degenerating device performance, which could facilitate the fabrication and contacting of nanowire array solar cells.

Materials with both larger and smaller band gaps would allow for the fabrication of semiconductor heterostructures that have increased function in the ultraviolet (UV) region of the spectrum. ZnO is a wide band-gap material possessing good radiation-resistance properties. It is desirable to modify the energy band gap of ZnO to smaller values than that for ZnO and to larger values than that for ZnO for use in semiconductor devices. A material with band gap energy larger than that of ZnO would allow for the emission at shorter wavelengths for LED (light emitting diode) and LD (laser diode) devices, while a material with band gap energy smaller than that of ZnO would allow for emission at longer wavelengths for LED and LD devices.

30|$|In Fig.  4, both KPFM and CP-AFM {{measurements}} {{along the}} cell cross section {{show that the}} profiles with and without illumination diverge strongly at the epi-Si/wafer p++ interface.

In recent years, many non-linear photonic devices have been demonstrated based on the Silicon On Insulator (SOI) technology platform allowing for an unprecedented level of integration. Many research groups have demonstrated non-linear devices that can perform wavelength conversion [2], demultiplexing operations [3] and all-optical switching [4].

Using the area indented by CP-AFM as a geolocalization mark, we could perform measurements within a 100 -μm distance, thus ensuring that the conditions of illumination and the local electrical properties of the solar cell are similar. By adapting our CP-AFM setup, we have proposed {{a new way of}} performing photocurrent measurements without an external voltage source, which enables an easier interpretation of the date. Photocurrent and photovoltage measurements are coherent with what is expected: photocurrent increases and surface potential decreases in the epitaxial silicon layer with increasing illumination intensity. The difficulties to achieve quantitative measurements are discussed. In particular, we highlight different sources of measurement artifacts. CP-AFM is very sensitive to the surface topography while KPFM is very sensitive to the surface condition (e.g., surface oxidation or surface contamination). The sample preparation steps (cleavage, polishing and cleaning) are therefore crucial to achieve accurate measurements. We also found that reproducibility of CP-AFM is more challenging than for KPFM measurements. The potential reasons are the degradation of both the area of the sample scanned and that of the measurement setup (abrasion of the tip and drift of the AFM laser). Despite these limitations, the comparison of measurements highlighted a dissymmetry on profiles along the <b>PIN</b> <b>junction</b> enabling to raise a hypothesis on undesired phenomena during the deposition process: unintentional n-doping of the epitaxial silicon layer and defective interface between the wafer and the epitaxial layer.

The turbulence models examined are the shear-stress transport (SST) model and the stress-omega Reynolds stress model (RSM). In all simulations, the mesh was fine enough so that wall functions were not employed and integration of all equations is to the wall. Since RSM naturally accounts for streamline curvature, anisotropy of the Reynolds stresses, and the time-lagged response of turbulence to changes in the mean flow, predictions from RSM were used to assess the results from the SST model on the flow structure and surface heat transfer. Results obtained show how different models capture the key flow features created by a staggered array of pin fins—namely the horseshoe vortex at the <b>pin</b> fin-wall <b>junction,</b> the wake behind each pin fin, and their interactions - and how those flow structures affect surface heat transfer. Results are also obtained to show the differences in the predicted heat transfer coefficient with and without conjugate analysis. ...|$|R
