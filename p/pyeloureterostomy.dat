40|$|<b>Pyeloureterostomy</b> {{was used}} as the {{preferred}} method of urinary tract reconstruction in 260 of 371 consecutive renal allograft procedures performed between September 1967 and December 1980. Initially chromic catgut suture was used for the anastomosis in 96 patients with ten complications developing (10. 4 %). Because of the high incidence of anastomotic leakage (8. 3 %) with chromic catgut suture, the next 101 pyeloureterostomies were constructed using 7 - 0 Tevdek. Although urinary leakage occurred in only five of these patients (4. 9 %), late stone formation occurred along the suture material in three patients (2. 9 %), influencing the conversion to 7 - 0 Prolene for this anastomosis. With this suture material, only two complications have occurred in 63 subsequent pyeloureterostomies (3. 1 %), neither related to the anastomosis. In comparison, eight complications developed in 111 patients who underwent reconstruction with the Politano-Leadbetter method of ureteroneocystostomy (7. 2 %). The currently recommended method for <b>pyeloureterostomy,</b> as described, when combined with meticulous attention to technical details has made <b>pyeloureterostomy</b> a safe and effective method of urinary tract reconstruction in renal transplant recipients, with morbidity indistinguishable from that of ureteroneocystostomy...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction Complete {{ureteral}} avulsion {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious complications of ureteroscopy. The aim of this report was to look for a good solution to full-length complete ureteral avulsion. Case presentation A 40 -year-old man underwent ureteroscopic management. Full-length complete avulsion of ureter occurred during ureteroscopy. <b>Pyeloureterostomy</b> plus greater omentum investment outside the avulsed ureter and ureterovesical anastomosis were performed 6 hours after ureteral avulsion. The patient was followed-up during 34 months. Double-J tube was removed at 3 months after operation. Twenty three months after the first operation, the patient developed hydronephrosis because of a new ureter upside stone, then rigid ureteroscopy and holmium laser lithotripsy were used successfully. Conclusion <b>Pyeloureterostomy</b> plus greater omentum investment outside the avulsed ureter and ureterovesical anastomosis may be a good choice for full-length complete ureteral avulsion...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuplications of the urinary {{collecting}} system and pyelo-ureteral junction obstruction (PUJO) are common, but the simultaneous presence of both anomalies is rarely encountered. In incomplete duplicated systems, PUJO usually affects the lower moiety. We present {{the case of}} a 5 -year old boy with left bifid renal pelvis and hydronephosis of the lower moiety treated by robot-assisted <b>pyeloureterostomy...</b>|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Ureteroneocystostomy (UCN) is {{the most}} widely used urinary {{reconstruction}} technique during kidney transplantation. Disadvantages of this technique include a high incidence of hematuria and reflux, plus the potential for obstruction resulting from distal ureteral fibrosis. <b>Pyeloureterostomy</b> (PU) avoids these complications but increases the technical complexity. METHODS: Between January 1990 and December 2005, 1066 adults patients underwent kidney transplantations; 768 patients (72. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{cases with}} {{incomplete}} ureteric duplication, lower pole ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) may occur as an unusual entity. Surgical reconstruction of UPJO {{can be with}} different techniques such as pyeloplasty, <b>pyeloureterostomy</b> or ureteroureterostomy. In our case, the connecting segment distal to the pelvioureteric junction was found short and we performed direct pyeloureteral side-to-side anastomosis, with a double j catheter. It is helpful to determine prior to reconstruction of a short lower pole ureteral length...|$|E
40|$|Pyelouretersotomy or ureteroureterostomy was the {{urinary tract}} {{reconstructive}} procedure in 114 of 132 consecutive renal transplants {{performed at the}} Massachusetts General Hospital from September 1967 to December 1973. Anastomotic leakage was the only complication related to failure of <b>pyeloureterostomy</b> or ureteroureterostomy. This occurred in nine transplants (7. 9 %). Since 1970, only four anastomotic leaks have occurred in 79 consecutive pyeloureterostomies or ureteroureterostomies. Six of the nine primary anastomotic leaks were corrected either by retrograde ureteral catheter drainage or re-suturing of the anastomotic defect. Only one patient {{died as a result}} of complications following a leak. The operative technique is described with emphasis on the important details believed necessary for consistent success in performing this procedure...|$|E
40|$|The twelfth case of {{bilateral}} ectopic ureteroceles in Japan is reported. A two-month-old girl {{was referred to}} our clinic because of urinary tract infection. Two large intravesical cystic lesions communicating to the dilated upper urinary tracts, which were compatible with bilateral ectopic ureteroceles were detected. Histological findings of the upper moieties of the duplex kidney showed dysplasia on the left side, and immaturity {{on the right side}}. Left heminephrectomy was performed, and a <b>pyeloureterostomy</b> was applied on the right side after placement of nephrostomy for 6 months. The ureteroceles collapsed satisfactorily to void smoothly. The patient has not been in trouble for more than thirty months postoperatively. Indications for preservation of the upper segment and ureterocelectomy in small infants are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Between December 1964 and April 1974, 216 renal transplants were {{performed}} on 200 recipients at the University Clinic of the Cantonal Hospital at Zurich. The ureteroneocystostomy was performed in most cases, a <b>pyeloureterostomy</b> being done only five times. 12 % of all recipients (24 patients) developed serious urological postoperative complications involving 27 (14. 3 %) of the transplants, with four cases being fatal. Not considered as a serious complication were urinary infections and retention due to clotting, both {{of which could be}} treated conservatively with success. Of the more serious cases, 8 involved stenosis of the ureter, 4 compression of the ureter, 2 obstruction of the ureter, and 4 bladder fistulation. In 10 of these cases the complication can be related to imperfect operative technique in respect to transplanting the donor kidney. Preserving sufficient ureter vascularization is of paramount importance, and consideration must be given to increased vulnerability to infection {{as a result of the}} immunosuppressive therapy. Extreme stripping of the pyelon and ureter can result in stenosis and necrosis of the ureter. The treatment of urinary passage complications has not been standardized. However, fistula closure and operative correction of ureter obstruction must be carried out quickly...|$|E
40|$|Background/PurposeThe {{technical}} and ergonomic details of laparoendoscopic single site (LESS) reconstruction {{have not been}} reported. In this study, we explored the feasibility and safety of performing advanced LESS upper urinary tract reconstruction with conventional laparoscopic instruments. MethodsBetween September 2010 and March 2011, we retrospectively reviewed prospectively collected data from five patients who underwent LESS urinary tract reconstruction. The LESS reconstruction included <b>pyeloureterostomy</b> (N =  1), dismembered pyeloplasty (N =  2), ureteroneocystostomy (N =  1), and ureteroplasty for bifid blind ending ureter (N =  1). The perioperative and postoperative parameters were collected for analysis. The ergonomic principles and techniques are detailed. ResultsAll reconstructive LESS procedures were completed successfully without open conversion or laparoscopic conversion. Ancillary ports or ancillary instruments were not applied {{in any of the}} patients. The mean patient age was 40. 4 years. The mean operative time was 213  ±  69 minutes, the estimated blood loss ranged from minimal to 50  mL, and the mean hospital stay was 4. 4  ±  4 days. No operation-related complication occurred. ConclusionBased on our ergonomic principles and suturing/knotting techniques, conventional laparoscopic instruments are feasible and safe for LESS urinary reconstructive procedures...|$|E
40|$|Aim. Ureteral {{obstruction}} {{secondary to}} ischemia {{is the most}} common urologic complication of kidney trans- plantation. Pyeloureteral anastomosis with recipient ureter has shown most satisfactory long-term results in its management. Existing urinary infection and immunosupression determine the high risk of wound complications. We have experience more than 50 reconstructive procedures of urinary tract after kidney transplantation by open surgery during 25 years. Till last time this procedure has been performed through open surgery. Method. We used pyeloureteral anastomosis with recipient ureter in two patients with ureteral stricture after kidney transplantation by laparoscopic approach. The operations lasted 215 and 275 min respectively. In both cases the surgery was per- formed after percutaneous nephrostomy because of deterioration of transplanted kidney function. Internal stent was indwelled laparoscopicaly. No drain tube was left. Results. The nephrostomy tubes were removed after 10 and 7 days respectively. The stents were removed after 27 and 20 days respectively. No complications were seen during the surgery and postoperative period. Now serum creatinine level is 0. 12 mmol/l and 0. 15 mmol/l after 15 and 12 months after surgery respectively. Conclusion. In spite of some dif fi culties related with topographic land- marks and severe tissues fi brosis after transplantation laparoscopic <b>pyeloureterostomy</b> in transplanted kidney is safe and feasible procedure. The main advantage is absence of risk of most serious complications related with wound infection in immune compromised patients. Moreover, early recovery to usual activity and diet facilita- tes to prevent pulmonary infections and to normalize intestinal absorbability of the immunosuppressive drugs.   </div...|$|E
