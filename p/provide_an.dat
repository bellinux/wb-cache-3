5|$|In 2007 Pistorius {{applied to}} run in non-disabled track meets. He was at first accepted, but {{questions}} quickly arose about whether the blades give him an unfair advantage. After initial research showed the blades did <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> advantage, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) changed their rules to ban the use of technical devices that <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> advantage and ruled him ineligible to compete. Pistorius challenged the ruling with additional research and was reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2008, meaning that he can continue {{to run in}} non-disabled meets {{as long as he}} uses the equipment that was studied in the research.|$|E

30|$|As {{noted by}} Groff [15], RAT <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> groundwork for interaction, {{but does not}} <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> {{framework}} for decision making. Cornish and Clarke’s [16] rational choice theory (RCT) contends that offenders are rational, similar to non-offenders; however, they have a propensity to commit crime that sets them apart. RCT <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> perspective by which offenders are rational actors and seek optimal strategies for themselves. RAT <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> framework for interacting pieces within a criminological system and RCT <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> theory for rational offender decision-making.|$|R
