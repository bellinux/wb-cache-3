40|$|To achieve {{enhanced}} cooling of hot {{components in}} the high pressure (HP) section of an aeroengine, application of cooled cooling air (CCA) has been proposed. Here a “two row <b>preswirl</b> feed” arrangement is considered to accommodate the CCA, together with the uncooled cooling air (UCA) in high pressure turbine (HPT) <b>preswirl</b> cavity. The CCA and UCA inflows are introduced into the <b>preswirl</b> cavity at two different radii. Most of the cooling air leaves the <b>preswirl</b> cavity from the receiver holes. To assess the CCA behavior in the <b>preswirl</b> cavity, a definition of feeding effectiveness is introduced based on the relative total temperature at the exit of the receiver hole. The CFD investigation for the <b>preswirl</b> cavity was conducted in a systematic way by altering both the radial position of the receiver hole and inflows of the CCA and UCA, while keeping other conditions unchanged. It {{was found that the}} feeding effectiveness increases as the radial position of the receiver hole decreases. An optimal feeding effectiveness close to a minimum mixing condition was achieved by adjusting the CCA and UCA inflows. Unsteady CFD investigations gave a similar prediction for the overall performance of the CCA in the <b>preswirl</b> cavity, but with a lower feeding effectiveness compared with its steady CFD counterpart. The reduction in the feeding effectiveness was attributed to an enhanced mixing from the discrete CCA and UCA inflows and associated unsteady effects...|$|E

40|$|Modem gas {{turbines}} are cooled using air diverted from the compressor In a "direct transfer" <b>preswirl</b> system, this cooling air flows axially across the wheel space from stationary <b>preswirl</b> nozzles to receiver holes {{located in the}} rotating turbine disk. The distribution of the local Nusselt number Nu on the rotating disk is governed by three nondimensional fluid-dynamic parameters: <b>preswirl</b> ratio beta(p), rotational Reynolds number Reo, and turbulent flow parameter lambda(T). This paper describes heat transfer measurements obtained from a scaled model of a gas turbine rotor-stator cavity, where the flow structure is representative of that found in the engine. The experiments reveal that Nu on the rotating disk is axisymmetric except {{in the region of}} the receiver holes, where significant two-dimensional variations have been measured. At the higher coolant flow rates studied, there is a peak in heat transfer at the radius of the <b>preswirl</b> nozzles associated with the impinging jets from the <b>preswirl</b> nozzles.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} effect of the radial {{location}} of the inlet nozzles on the performance of a direct-transfer <b>preswirl</b> system in a rotor-stator wheel-space. A commercial code is used to solve the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations using a high-Reynolds-number kappa-epsilon/kappa-omega turbulence model with wall functions. The three-dimensional steady-state model has previously been validated against experimental results from a scale model of a gas turbine rotor-stator system. Computations are performed for three inlet-to-outlet radius ratios, r(p) /r(b) = 0. 8, 0. 9, and 1. 0, a range of <b>preswirl</b> ratios, 0. 5 < beta(b) < 2. 0, and varying turbulent flow parameters, 0. 12 < gamma(T) < 0. 36. The rotational Reynolds number for each case is 10 (6). The flow structure in the wheel-space and in the region around the receiver holes for each inlet radius is related to the swirl ratio. The performance of the system is quantified by two parameters: the discharge coefficient for the receiver holes (C-d,C-b) and the adiabatic effectiveness for the system (Theta(b,ad)). As in previous work, the discharge coefficient is found to reach a maximum when the rotating core of fluid is in synchronous rotation with the receiver holes. As the radius ratio is increased, this condition can be achieved with a smaller value for <b>preswirl</b> ratio Ob. A simple model is presented to estimate the discharge coefficient based on the flowrate and swirl ratio in the system. The adiabatic effectiveness of the system increases linearly with <b>preswirl</b> ratio but is independent of flowrate. For a given <b>preswirl</b> ratio, the effectiveness increases as the radius ratio increases. Computed values show good agreement with analytical results. Both performance parameters show improvement with increasing inlet radius ratio, suggesting that for an optimum <b>preswirl</b> configuration an engine designer would place the <b>preswirl</b> nozzles at a high radius...|$|E
40|$|The T 56 Series III 1 st stage {{rotor blade}} is cooled using {{moderately}} preswirled air from 36 <b>preswirl</b> injection nozzles. The amount of swirl achieved by discrete <b>preswirl</b> coolant jets is generally unknown, due to mixing losses. A “frozen-rotor ” CFD analysis was therefore performed on a {{sector of the}} NGV support plate/ 1 st stage rotor disc cavity of the T 56 turboprop engine, including a <b>preswirl</b> injection hole and {{a section of the}} upstream plenum. It was found for this geometry that the mean tangential velocity of the coolant in the <b>preswirl</b> region of the rotor-stator cavity was about half the maximum tangential velocity in the <b>preswirl</b> jets (Cθmean/Cθmaxjet = 0. 5). This value was used in ICP, a one-dimensional coolant flow network program, to model coolant flow in the disc cavities. ICP was then iterated with the disc assembly conduction code DCOOL to obtain the temperature distribution in the disc assembly. The result was compared with the resultant temperature distribution for a Cθmean/Cθmaxjet value of unity. The temperature distribution in most of the 1 st disc remained largely insensitive to the value of Cθmean/Cθmaxjet, showing the spacer to play a greater role in heat conduction to the disc than the blade shanks...|$|E
40|$|In {{high-pressure}} centrifugal compressors, honeycomb seals {{are often}} used as replacements for labyrinth seals to enhance dynamic stability. A concern exists {{with the loss of}} this enhanced stability if the honeycomb cavities become clogged with debris over time. So, as a first objective, static and dynamic tests were conducted on a constant-clearance honeycomb and a constant-clearance smooth-bore seal under three inlet <b>preswirl</b> conditions {{to determine the effects of}} inlet <b>preswirl.</b> The resulting leakage flowrate and dynamic parameters, effective stiffness and damping of the seal, were measured for each seal and then compared, with the smooth-bore seal representing the honeycomb seal with completely clogged cells. The second objective was to evaluate a two-control volume theory by Kleynhans and Childs with the measured data under the influence of <b>preswirl.</b> Both seals have a 114. 7 mm bore with a radial clearance of 0. 2 mm from the test rotor. The honeycomb seal has a cell width of 0. 79 mm and cell depth of 3. 2 mm. The target test matrix for each <b>preswirl</b> setting consisted of three exit-to-inlet pressure ratios of 15 %, 35 %, and 50 %, and three rotor speeds out to 20, 200 rpm. The target inlet air pressure was 70 bar-a. Experimental results show that, for a clean honeycomb seal, <b>preswirl</b> has little effect on effective stiffness, Keff*, and decreases effective damping, Ceff*, by about 20 % at the high inlet <b>preswirl</b> ratio (~ 0. 6). However, comparing smooth and honeycomb seal results at higher inlet <b>preswirl</b> shows a potential reduction in Keff* by up to 68 %, and a large drop and shift in positive Ceff* values, which could cause an instability in the lower frequency range. Measured leakage shows a potential increase of about 80 %, regardless of test conditions. A swirl brake at the seal entrance would fix this loss in stability by significantly reducing inlet <b>preswirl.</b> The two-control-volume theory model by Kleynhans and Childs seems to follow the frequency-dependent experimental data well for the honeycomb seal. Theory predicts conservatively (under-predicts) for stability parameters such as k* and Ceff* and for leakage.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of high supply (up to 84 bar) pressure testing of hole-pattern annular gas seals performed at the Texas A & M Turbomachinery Laboratory in College Station, TX. The test variables were chosen to determine the influence of pressure ratio, rotor speed, and negative <b>preswirl</b> on seal performance. <b>Preswirl</b> signifies the circumferential fluid flow entering a seal, and negative <b>preswirl</b> indicates a fluid swirl in the direction opposite of rotor rotation. Changes in pressure ratio had only small effects on most rotordynamic coefficients. Cross-coupled stiffness showed slightly different profiles through the mid-range of excitation frequencies. Pressure ratio showed some influence on direct and cross-coupled damping at low excitation frequencies. Rotor speed significantly affected both cross-coupled stiffness and cross-coupled damping. As rotor speed increased, the magnitude of cross-coupled rotordynamic coefficients increased due to the positive fluid swirl induced by rotor rotation. For the low rotor speed, negative inlet <b>preswirl</b> was able to overpower the positive rotor induced fluid rotation, producing a negative cross-coupled stiffness. This outcome showed that, for hole-pattern seals, positive fluid swirl does indeed produce positive cross-coupled stiffness coefficients and negative fluid swirl produces negative cross-coupled stiffness coefficients. The addition of negative <b>preswirl</b> greatly reduced cross-coupled rotordynamic coefficients, while direct rotordynamic terms were unaffected. Cross-over frequency signifies the excitation frequency where effective damping transitions from a negative value to a positive value with increasing excitation frequency. Peak effective damping was increased by 50 percent and cross-over frequency reduced by 50 percent for high-negative <b>preswirl</b> versus zero <b>preswirl</b> results. This led to the conclusion that a reverse swirl could greatly enhance the stability of hole-pattern balance piston seals. A two-control-volume model that uses the ideal gas law at constant temperature (ISOT) was used to predict rotordynamic coefficients and leakage. This model predicted direct rotordynamic coefficients well, but greatly under predicted cross-coupled rotordynamic coefficients especially at high negative preswirls. The model predicted seal leakage well at low pressure ratios, but showed increasing error as the pressure ratio was increased. These results showed that the prediction model could not adequately estimate cross-coupled rotordynamic coefficients for a hole-pattern seal with negative inlet <b>preswirl</b> and requires modification to do so...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} computational {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) predictions of flow and heat transfer for an over-swirled low-radius <b>preswirl</b> system and comparison with experimental data. The rotor-stator CFD model comprises a stationary domain with the <b>preswirl</b> nozzles and a rotating domain with the receiver holes. The fluid-dynamic conditions feature an over-swirled system with a swirl ratio at the nozzle radius β p 1. 4 - 1. 5 and rotational Reynolds number Re Φ 0. 8 × 10 6 and 1. 2 10 6. Three different treatments for the rotating and stationary domain interface are {{used to evaluate the}} influence on the flow and heat transfer behavior: a stationary approach (including Coriolis forces in the rotating domain) with direct connection and fixed angle between <b>preswirl</b> nozzle and receiver holes; a stationary approach with circumferential averaging of the velocity at radial bands; and a full transient simulation with the rotating domain capturing the unsteady flow due to the rotating receiver holes. Results at different circumferential angles show high variability in pressure and velocity distributions at the <b>preswirl</b> inlet nozzle radius. Circumferential averaging of these flow parameters lead to an alignment of the pressures and velocities between the three different interface approaches. Comparison with experimental pressure and swirl-ratio data show a quantitative agreement but the CFD results feature a systematic overestimation outward of the <b>preswirl</b> nozzle radius. Heat transfer coefficient distributions at the rotor surface show the effect of the different interface approaches and dependence on the flow structure (for example the impinging jet and vortex structures). The three different interface approaches result in significant differences in the computed heat transfer coefficients between pairs of receiver holes. Circumferentially averaged heat transfer coefficients inward of the receiver holes radius show good agreement between the transient and stationary direct connection interfaces, whereas those for the circumferential averaging interface differ, contrary to the flow parameters, due to smoothing of local effects from the <b>preswirl</b> jets...|$|E
40|$|Results are {{presented}} for measured and predicted rotordynamic coefficients and leakage for hole-pattern seals {{with a hole}} depth that varies axially along the seal. Testing was done to discover how pressure ratio, inlet <b>preswirl,</b> and rotor speed affect the seals?????? rotordynamic characteristics and leakage. The results were compared to a constant hole depth hole-pattern seal. Experimental {{results show that the}} seals?????? rotordynamic characteristics are not strongly influenced by pressure ratio. There were three <b>preswirl</b> conditions tested, each separated by a 6. 9 bar (100 psi) difference in inlet pressure. Therefore, normalized <b>preswirl</b> results were compared. The normalized results indicate that introducing inlet fluid <b>preswirl</b> affects the crosscoupled stiffness and effective damping coefficients. Inlet <b>preswirl</b> increases the magnitude of cross-coupled stiffness. Effective damping decreases with inlet <b>preswirl,</b> as well as the effective damping cross-over frequency increasing. These results indicate that swirl brakes would be of great value. Rotor speed had a significant effect on the cross-coupled coefficients; both increased with speed. Experimental results were compared to results for a constant hole depth holepattern seal. The variable hole-depth seal has higher direct damping. The crosscoupled stiffness and cross-coupled damping coefficients were very similar. The direct stiffness was always lower at lower frequencies and higher at higher frequencies for the variable hole depth hole-pattern seal. This was also the case for effective stiffness. The effective damping of the variable hole-depth seal was not only larger than for the constant hole depth seal, it also had a drastically lower cross-over frequency. The difference in cross-over frequency was 40 percent on average. Experimental results for rotordynamic characteristics and leakage were compared to theoretical predictions by ISOTSEAL 2, a modified version of ISOTSEAL. Both cross-coupled stiffness and damping are reasonably predicted. Direct damping is always under-predicted. ISOTSEAL 2 does a poor job of predicting direct stiffness. Direct stiffness is over-predicted at lower frequencies and under-predicted at higher frequencies. This is also the case for effective stiffness. ISOTSEAL 2 under-predicts the direct damping, but does an excellent job of predicting the direct damping crossover frequency. Seal leakage is well predicted by ISOTSEAL 2...|$|E

Experimental results show that cross-coupled stiffness coefficients are highly influenced by fluid <b>preswirl</b> and only moderately influenced by other operating parameters, whereas direct damping is nearly unaffected by changes in operating parameters. Effective damping, a good indicator of stability, is highly affected by fluid <b>preswirl.</b> Although rotordynamic coefficients of straight smooth annular gas seals {{are assumed to be}} frequency independent, experimental results suggest a frequency dependent nature at high back-pressures and high excitation frequencies.

40|$|LectureThe rotordynamic {{stability}} of high pressure compressors is strongly {{affected by the}} aerodynamic effects induced by the gas flow through rotor-stator seals. In particular the tangential velocity (swirl) of the gas flowing through the seals is a main destabilizing factor (Childs, 1993) and therefore needs to be minimized. Swirl brakes are well-known devices to reduce the swirl of the leakage at seal inlet, or <b>preswirl.</b> Their effectiveness is function of several geometrical parameters (swirl brake vane dimensions and shape, clearance gap between rotor and stator, seal diameter) and operating parameters (such as rotating speed, gas pressure, temperature, molecular weight, gas swirl upstream of the seal). A CFD study {{was carried out in}} order to evaluate the impact of each geometrical parameter on swirl brake performance, starting from a baseline and varying it over a possible design range. The purpose was to identify an optimum design that could achieve a strong <b>preswirl</b> reduction over the widest range of compressor applications, sizes and operating conditions. Swirl brakes developed according to this optimization study were used in a high pressure centrifugal compressor. The full load test performed in 2013 included a direct measurement of the logarithmic decrement, thus providing useful information to validate the outcome of the analysis.

40|$|To reduce {{manufacturing}} cost and time, a hole-pattern seal incorporating holes of larger diameter (12. 19 mm (0. 48 inches)) has been proposed. Experimental leakage and rotordynamic coefficients {{for this new}} seal design are presented. This experimental data was compared to theoretical results generated by ISOTSEAL a program developed by Kleynhans and Childs. Finally, the performance of this new hole-pattern seal was compared to a hole-pattern seal tested by Wade. The experiments are configured to investigate the influence of changes in pressure ratio, <b>preswirl,</b> rotor speed, and clearances on seal characteristics. Due to stator stability issues, the peak inlet pressures had to be varied to allow for testing. Consequently, to study the effect of inlet <b>preswirl</b> and clearance, data were non-dimensionalized or normalized. Cross-coupled coefficients were relatively frequency-independent while direct coefficients were functions of excitation frequency. For all test cases, the seal developed negative direct stiffness at low frequencies. Tests showed that pressure ratio had minimal effect on rotordynamic coefficients. Non-dimensional cross-coupled stiffness increased with increasing <b>preswirl</b> causing the seal to become less stable with increasing <b>preswirl.</b> Cross coupled stiffness increased with increasing running speed. Two clearances: 0. 1 mm (4 mils) and 0. 2 mm (8 mils) were tested. The results demonstrated that non-dimensionalized stiffness is greater for the smaller clearance. The larger clearance develops larger normalized direct damping values, and has enhanced stability. Rotordynamic predictions are poor for cross-coupled coefficients. Generally, ISOTSEAL over-predicts direct stiffness and under-predicts direct damping. Negative stiffness was not predicted by ISOTSEAL. Predictions do improve for the smaller clearance. ISOTSEAL {{does a good job}} of predicting non-dimensional leakage. Non-dimensionalized direct and effective stiffness were greater for the "old" hole-pattern seal tested by Wade. However, the "new" seal generally developed greater normalized direct damping and exhibited a lower cross-over frequency. Non-dimensionalized leakage was greater for the seal tested here. Production of this new seal proved to be more difficult than originally thought. The price of the new seal cost approximately the same as an original hole-pattern seal...|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} model {{based on a}} transformed, conservative form of the three dimensional Navier-Stokes equation and an analytical model based on lumped fluid parameters are presented and compared with studies of modeled rotor bearing seal systems. The rotor destabilizing factors {{are related to the}} rotative character of the flow field. It is shown that these destabilizing factors can be reduced through a decrease in the fluid average circumferential velocity. However, the rotative character of the flow field is a complex three dimensional system with bifurcated secondary flow patterns that significantly alter the fluid circumferential velocity. By transforming the Navier-Stokes equations to those for a rotating observer and using the numerical code PHOENICS- 84 with a nonorthogonal body fitted grid, several numerical experiments were carried out to demonstrate the character of this complex flow field.

Tests were conducted at speeds out to 16, 000 rpm, supply pressures up to 18. 3 bars, and the following three inlet tangential velocity conditions: (1) no preswirl; (2) intermediate <b>preswirl</b> {{in the direction of}} rotation; and (3) high <b>preswirl</b> in the direction of rotation. The back pressure can be controlled independently and was varied to yield the following four pressure ratios: 0. 4, 0. 45, 0. 56, and 0. 67. The central and simplest conclusion to be obtained from the test series is that the alternate swirl brake consistently outperforms the current swirl brake in terms of stability performance. The alternate swirl brake's whirl frequency ratio was generally about one half or less than corresponding values for the current design.

Measurements for both seals are also compared to predictions from XLLaby. Both seals have identical diameters {{and can be}} considered as relatively long labyrinth seals. The TOR seal has a length-to-diameter ratio of 0. 62, whereas the TOS seal is longer and has a length-to-diameter ratio of 0. 75. Both seals also differ by number of teeth, tooth height, and tooth cavity length. TOR labyrinth tests were carried out at an inlet pressure of 70 bar-a (1, 015 psia), pressure ratios of 0. 4, 0. 5, and 0. 6, rotor speeds up to 20, 200 rpm, a radial clearance of 0. 1 mm (4 mils), and three <b>preswirl</b> ratios.

TOR labyrinth measurements show a pronounced dependence of rotordynamic coefficients on rotor speed, especially when compared to prior documented TOS labyrinth seal tests run at a radial clearance of 0. 2 mm (8 mils). The TOR labyrinth cross-coupled stiffness is higher in magnitude and increases at a higher rate for increasing speed than that of the TOS labyrinth. However, the TOR labyrinth effective damping was determined to be greater due to higher measurements of direct damping.

40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{the results of}} high pressure testing of hole-pattern annular gas seals conducted at the Texas A&M University's Turbomachinery Laboratory. The testing conditions were aimed at determining the test seals sensitivity to pressure ratio, inlet fluid <b>preswirl,</b> rotor speed, and rotor to seal clearance. The rotordynamic coefficients showed only small changes resulting from the different pressure ratios tested. Only the damping terms at the lower frequencies showed some influence. One other notable result from the testing of different pressure ratios is that the seals were tested in a choked flow condition, {{and there was not}} a significant change in the seal behavior when the seals transitioned to the choked condition. The inlet fluid <b>preswirl</b> only had a notable effect on the cross-coupled stiffness in the larger clearance tests. These results lead to the conclusion that a swirl brake could have some rotordynamic value, but only if the seals have sufficiently large clearance. Conversely this also means that if hole-pattern seals are being implemented with a small clearance, then a swirl brake would not be an effective way to improve the rotordynamic stability of the system. The only significant effect that the rotor speeds had on the rotordynamic coefficients were that the cross-coupled coefficients increased as the rotor speed increased. This is the expected result because as the rotor speed increases there is a greater shear force on the gas as it passes through the seal resulting in more fluid circumferential velocity, which results in stronger cross-coupled coefficients. The changes in clearance resulted in drastic changes in the magnitude of the coefficients. The smaller clearance yielded much higher coefficients than the larger clearance. All of the rotordynamic coefficients were predicted well by ISOTSEAL. The code was found {{to do a good job}} predicting the seal leakage as well.

Experiments were carried out for three different jetto- cross-flow velocity ratios (R = 4. 0, 5. 1, 6. 2) and angles (θ = 90 °, 75 °, 60 °). Hot film anemometry was used to determine velocity magnitudes. Correlation of the data obtained revealed that the jet axes for the 90 degree angle correlated very well when the non-dimensional spatial coordinates were reduced by R² whereas the axes for the 75 and 60 degree angles correlated well when their coordinates were reduced by R. This suggested that there was a prominence of momentum effects for the smaller angles, as opposed to a prominence of energy (inertia) effects for the normal jet. The decay of excess non-dimentional velocity for all experimental conditions was very well correlated when the non-dimentional natural coordinate (jet axis) was reduced by R, {{the relationship between the two}} being very nearly linear with a - 0. 77 power of s/hR. The velocity profile data obtained proved to be impossible to correlate and no conclusions on velocity profile similarity could be drawn. The jet axis and velocity decay correlations proved useful in concluding that the <b>preswirl</b> concept for the V. A. H. R. could be feasible given large enough velues of jet velocity ratio and jet orifice apperture, in order, however, to be possible to draw any definite conclusions for the receiver design, a scaled model of the V. A. H. R. would need to be constructed and tested...|$|E
40|$|Short {{staggered}} {{labyrinth seals}} {{are widely used}} in high pressure cylinder shroud seals of steam turbines. They are good at restricting the leakage flow but do not respond well to rotordynamics and often lead to turbomachine instabilities. A numerical investigation into the leakage and rotordynamic characteristics of a short staggered labyrinth seal is carried out in this paper, concerning effects of pressure ratio, inlet <b>preswirl,</b> rotational speed, seal clearance and whirling frequency, using both the whirling rotor method and the multiple frequencies transient simulation method. The numerical model is verified by experimental data. The result shows that the staggered labyrinth seals have a similar but not identical leakage and rotordynamic performance {{compared with that of}} teeth-on-stator see-through labyrinth seals. The cross-coupled stiffness can be reduced by decrease inlet swirl with considering the factor of rotational speed, which can significantly benefit the stability of rotor system...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThis paper {{shows the}} study of <b>preswirl</b> duct as an {{effective}} energy saving devices that have been devised and reviewed to support the propeller performance, especially for the ship of VLCC with large block coefficients. From the bare hull wake measurements, typical upper/lower asymmetry of hull wake at the propeller disk was found. The 2 kinds of pre-swirl duct, Unconventional half circular duct and Conventional circular pre-swirl duct have been designed and reviewed to recover the loss of propeller running in that condition. The general function of the pre-swirl duct was set to work against this asymmetry of wake and generate pre-swirled flow into the propeller against the propeller ro-tating direction. The optimum self propulsion tests with various angle configurations were carried out and the best configuration was decided. Accordingly, cavitation test was carried out with best configuration of unconventional half circular duct. The blade surface and tip vortex cavitation behaved smoother when the duct was mounted. The hull pressure amplitudes reflected this difference, so the hull pressure amplitude with duct was smaller than that of without duct...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 55 - 64 The rotordynamic and leaking {{characteristics}} of {{two types of}} gas damper seals, honeycomb seal and pocket damper seal, were experimentally evaluated on a rotating test rig. The effect of supply pressure, <b>preswirl,</b> and seal eccentricity on seal dynamic performance was investigated in the tests. The pressurized working gas flowed through the seal and exhausted to atmospheric conditions. The maximum seal supply pressure was limited to 500 psia. By simulating the rotor experimental unbalance response and amplification factors based on a well-established rotor model, the equivalent stiffness and damping coefficients were estimated for tested gas damper seals. Experimental results confirm that both honeycomb and pocket damper seals provide high positive effective damping. On the other hand, the pocket damper seal increases the first critical speed. A correlation study was performed between the identified rotordynamic coefficients and predictions obtained from existing theoretical models for both honeycomb and pocket damper seals. In this paper is discussed as well a damper seal design {{and its impact on}} the rotordynamic performance of an industrial high-pressure compressor rotor...|$|E

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) for the prediction of flow and heat transfer in a direct transfer <b>preswirl</b> system is assessed through a comparison of CFD results with experimental measurements. Axisymmetric and three dimensional (3 D) sector CFD models are considered. In the 3 D sector models, the pre-swirl nozzles or receiver holes are represented as axisymmetric slots so that steady state solutions can be assumed. A number of commonly used turbulence models are tested in three different CFD codes, which were able to capture all of the significant features of the experiments. Reasonable quantitative agreement with experimental data for static pressure, total pressure and disc heat transfer is found for the different models, but all models gave results which differ from the experimental data in some respect. The more detailed 3 D geometry did not significantly improve the comparison with experiment, which suggested deficiencies in the turbulence modelling, particularly in the complex mixing region near the pre-swirl nozzle jets. The predicted heat transfer near the receiver holes was also shown {{to be sensitive to}} near-wall turbulence modelling. Overall, the results are encouraging for the careful use of CFD in pre-swirl-system design Copyright 2010 by ASME...|$|E
40|$|The {{leakages}} and {{the dynamic}} characteristics of six types of spiral grooved seals are experimentally investigated. The {{effect of the}} helix angle of the seal is investigated mainly under {{the condition of the}} same nominal clearances, land and groove lengths, and groove depths. The dynamic characteristics are measured for various parameters such as <b>preswirl</b> velocity, pressure difference between inlet and outlet of the seal, whirling amplitude, whirling speed, and rotating speed of the rotor. The results are also compared with leakage increases with the increase of the helix angle, but as the rotating speed increases, the leakages of the larger helix angle seals quickly drop. The leakage of the smooth-stator (SS) /smooth-grooved rotor (SGR) seal drops faster than that of the spiral-grooved stator (SGS) /smooth-rotor (SR) seal. It is found that a circumferential flow can be produced by the flow along the helix angle direction, and this circumferential flow acts as a negative swirl. For the present helix angle range, there is an optimum helix angle with which the seal has a comparatively positive effect on the rotor stability. Compared with the SGS/SR seals, the SS/SGR seal has a worse effect on the rotor stability...|$|E
40|$|Surge {{is a limit}} cycle {{oscillation}} in {{the pressure}} rise acid mass flow across an axial flow compressor. The generation of surge oscillations in axial flow compressors is investigated by a bifurcation analysis of the Moore-Greitzer model. The work reported in this paper {{is an extension of}} previous work by McCaughan which distinguished between deep surge and classic surge. In the present study, both deep surge and classic surge limit cycles are computed by using a continuation algorithm. The bifurcation mechanisms for the onset and termination of deep surge and classic surge: oscillations are discovered. It is found that the generation of deep surge is independent of the presence of classic surge. Classic surge limit cycles originate at a Hopf bifurcation and are found to terminate at a saddle loop. The occurrence of stable classic surge oscillations depends on the relative locations of the Hopf bifurcation point and the saddle loop. By modeling the effect of rotational disturbances at the compressor inlet as a perturbation to the compressor characteristic, it is shown that the rotational disturbance introduced by <b>preswirl,</b> inlet guide vanes, or air injection, can be used to manipulate the location of the bifurcation points so as to avoid stable classic surge...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{compares the}} leakage and rotordynamic {{characteristics of a}} slanted-tooth labyrinth seal to a conventional straight-tooth labyrinth. Detailed results comparing the rotordynamic coefficients and leakage parameters of a slanted-tooth see-through labyrinth seal and a straight-tooth see-through labyrinth seal are presented. The straight-tooth labyrinth seal used in this research was originally tested by Arthur Picardo. The slanted-tooth labyrinth seal was designed and fabricated to be identical to the straight-tooth labyrinth seal in terms of pitch, depth, {{and the number of}} teeth. The angle of inclination of the teeth in the slanted-tooth labyrinth seal was chosen to be 65 ? from the normal axis. The seals were tested at an inlet pressure of 70 bar-a (1015 psi-a), pressure ratios of 0. 4, 0. 5, and 0. 6, rotor speeds of 10, 200, 15, 350, and 20, 200 rpm, and a radial clearance of 0. 2 mm (8 mils). The experiments were carried out at zero, medium, and high inlet <b>preswirl</b> ratios. The experimental results show only minute differences in the rotordynamic coefficients between the two seals. But, the slanted-tooth labyrinth seal leaked approximately 10 % less than the straight-tooth labyrinth seal. A study of prediction versus experimental data was done. XLlaby was used for prediction. XLlaby was developed for a straight-tooth labyrinth seal design and did not do a good job in predicting the rotordynamic coefficients and the leakage rate...|$|E
