5000|$|Departing Souda Bay on 9 February Wood County {{returned}} home via Barcelona and Gibraltar {{and arrived at}} Little Creek on 28 February. However, soon after returning to her home port, Wood County began preparations {{to return to the}} Mediterranean. The coming deployment would be especially significant, as Wood County had been assigned the task of support ship to the product of the Navy's newest developments in hydrofoil technology, the gunboat [...] On 22 March 1971, Tucumcari was deck-loaded <b>piggyback</b> on <b>board</b> Wood County; and, three days later, the tank landing ship sailed from Little Creek, bound for the first stop on the special demonstration deployment. Over the ensuing months, Wood County and Tucumcari visited seven NATO nations and 16 ports: Copenhagen and Frederikshavn, Denmark; Kiel and Olpenitz, Germany; Portsmouth and the Isle of Portland, England; and Rendsburg, Germany. Then, after a transit of the Kiel Canal, she stopped at Rosyth, Scotland; Brest and Toulon, France; Naples, Brindisi, La Spezia, and Augusta, Sicily; Athens, Greece; and Gölcük, Turkey. Tucumcari was demonstrated in hopes that NATO would develop a guided-missile hydrofoil weapons system. In addition to providing a base of operations and facilities for briefings and discussions between United States liaison officers and foreign representatives, Wood County provided logistics support, messing and berthing facilities, and engaged in numerous public relations efforts to promote international goodwill. The performance of Wood County and Tucumcari both elicited praise from the Chief of Naval Operations; Commander Amphibious Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet; the United States NATO Mission; Commander in Chief, United States Naval Forces Europe, and others.|$|R
40|$|The {{acquisition}} of a single Silicon Photomultiplier require multiple and expensive electronics modules as : preamplifier, discriminator, bias voltage power supply, temperature monitor, Scalers, Analog to Digital Converter and Time to Digital Converter. The developed ArduSiPM is a compact cost effective and easily replicable Hardware software module for SiPM detector readout. The ArduSiPM uses an Arduino DUE (an open Software/Hardware board based on an ARM Cortex-M 3 microcontroller) as processor <b>board</b> and a <b>piggyback</b> custom designed <b>board</b> (Shield), these are controlled by custom developed software and interface. The Shield contains different electronics features both to monitor, to set and to acquire the SiPM signals using the microcontroller board. The shield embed a controlled bias voltage power supply, a fast voltage preamplifier, a programmable fast discriminator to generate over threshold digital pulse, a peak hold to measure the pulse height, a temperature monitor system, a scaler to monitor over threshold rate and arrival time of the pulses. A TCP/IP Wi-Fi or Ethernet connection is used both to control and to acquire the ArduSiPM remotely with either a PC software or a Tablet APP (depending on the application) ...|$|R
5000|$|A daughterboard, daughtercard, {{mezzanine}} board or <b>piggyback</b> <b>board</b> is an expansion card that attaches {{to a system}} directly. [...] Daughterboards often have plugs, sockets, pins or other attachments for other boards. Daughterboards often have only internal connections within a computer or other electronic devices, and usually access the motherboard directly rather than through a computer bus.|$|E
