These challenges include compliance to international treaties, practical implementation of regional guidelines and national strategies, in-creasing biosecurity and biosecurity awareness at all levels, empowering farmers to manage disease and other risks through better management practices, and conduct-ing targeted research that will support biosecurity assessments.

40|$|We {{describe}} VHA’s {{information technology}} (IT) implementation from the providers’ perspective, and identify factors influencing its effective implementation to improve care. We surveyed a stratified random national sample of 4227 clinicians from three VHA primary care provider groups: 1) physicians; 2) nurse practitioners, physician assistants; and 3) nurses. Facility-level IT support availability was rated across six dimensions: 1) access to literature/evidence, 2) computerized decision support, 3) computerized clinical data, 4) error reduction, 5) provider communication, and 6) patient communication. Factor analysis identified a 5 -item scale (IT clinical support, α = 0. 76). Generalized estimating equation models identified factors influencing IT clinical support.

In particular, it examines the role of firms' strategies in affecting {{the intensity of}} usage {{and the degree of}} substitution/complementarity between VoIP and other communications means. It investigates the importance of firms' strategies and compares pure players with the network-based operators, in order to understand whether the existence of bundling offerings as opposed to very low prices may drive consumers of specific companies to use the service more intensively. The results show that, once the control for the characteristics of VoIP <b>providers</b> <b>is</b> <b>included,</b> the customers of telecom operators are more likely to use intensively VoIP services, suggesting that the subscription to bundled service can attract consumers to value added services. Furthermore, those who use frequently VoIP services exploit the PC-to-telephone and Phone-to-Phone functionality suggesting that usage intensity is associated with a higher sophistication of the users more than with the existence of local effects on PC-to-PC applications. Finally, age and work conditions also play a role with respect to the intensity of VoIP usage. Consumers' adoption Telecom operators' strategies VoIP services...|$|R

Objective: The objective {{of the study was to}} assess the status of quality of PAC in health facilities of Amhara and Oromiya regional states. Methods: The study was cross-sectional by design and was conducted from November 2002 to March 2003. Patient interview, provider interview and direct service delivery observation were utilized to capture different aspects of care. Eleven health facilities (five in Oromiya and six in Amhara Regions), 103 post-abortion patients and 87 health service <b>providers</b> <b>were</b> <b>included</b> in the study. Results: although facilities were found to be prepared to manage abortion complications, some patients were delayed from receiving services because of requirement to pay before getting services, and to buy drugs and supplies from other sources. Patient-provider interaction was generally satisfactory as viewed by the respondents. Majority (88. 3 %) of patients felt that PAC services maintained confidentiality.

40|$|Spirituality {{and spiritual}} care are gaining {{increasing}} attention but their potential contribution to palliative care remains unclear. The {{aim of this}} study was to synthesize qualitative literature on spirituality and spiritual care at the end of life using a systematic (‘meta-study’) review. Eleven patient articles and eight with healthcare <b>providers</b> <b>were</b> <b>included,</b> incorporating data from 178 patients and 116 healthcare providers, mainly from elderly White and Judaeo-Christian origin patients with cancer. Spirituality principally focused on relationships, rather than just meaning making, and was given as a relationship. Spirituality was a broader term that may or may not encompass religion. A ‘spirit to spirit’ framework for spiritual care-giving respects individual personhood. This was achieved in the way physical care was given, by focusing on presence, journeying together, listening, connecting, creating openings, and engaging in reciprocal sharing. Affirmative relationships supported patients, enabling them to respond to their spiritual needs. The engagement of family caregivers in spiritual care appears underutilized. Relationships formed an integral part of spirituality as they were a spiritual need, caused spiritual distress when broken and were the way spiritual care was given. Barriers to spiritual care include lack of time, personal, cultural or institutional factors, and professional educational needs. By addressing these, we may make an important contribution to the improvement of patient care towards the end of life...|$|R
