40|$|Objectives: The {{activities}} of <b>pazufloxacin</b> and tosufloxacin against Legionella spp. were evaluated in vitro and {{compared with those}} of other quinolones, macrolides and azithromycin. Methods: The conventional MICs were determined by the microbroth dilution method. Intracellular {{activities of}} drugs were evaluated by a cfu count. The minimal extracellular concentration inhibiting intracellular growth of bacteria (MIEC) was determined by a colorimetric cytopathic assay. Results: MICs of pazuloxacin and tosufloxacin at which 90 % (MIC 90) of isolates are inhibited in 76 different Legionella spp. strains (38 ATCC strains and 38 clinical isolates) were 0. 032 and 0. 016 mg/L, whereas the MIC 90 s of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, garenoxacin, erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin were 0. 032, 0. 032, 0. 032, 2. 0, 0. 125 and 2. 0 mg/L, respectively. <b>Pazufloxacin</b> and tosufloxacin at 4 ·MIC inhibited intracellulargrowthofLegionellapneumophilaSG 1 (80 - 045 strain), asdidotherquinolones, clarithromycin and azithromycin, whereas erythromycin at 4 · MIC did not. MIECs of <b>pazufloxacin,</b> tosufloxacin, levo-floxacin, ciprofloxacin and garenoxacin for the strain were 0. 063, 0. 004, 0. 016, 0. 032 and 0. 008 mg/L respectively, which were superior to those of macrolides and azithromycin. <b>Pazufloxacin</b> showed potent activity against three additional clinical isolates of L. pneumophila SG 1, one clinical isolate each of L. pneumophila SG 3 and SG 5, as well as Legionella micdadei, Legionella dumoffii and Legionella long-beachae SG 1. Conclusions: <b>Pazufloxacin</b> and tosufloxacin, as well as other quinolones, were more potent than macro-lides and an azalide. Present data warrant further study on the efficacy of these drugs in the treatment of Legionella infections...|$|E
40|$|The {{patient was}} a 67 -year-old man with {{diabetes}} mellitus {{who had been}} to a hot spring spa {{a few days before}} his admission. The diagnosis of Legionella pneumonia was made using a urinary antigen assay. Intravenous <b>pazufloxacin</b> and oral clarithromycin were started. However, despite these treatments, he developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He was administered the combination of intravenous <b>pazufloxacin</b> and erythromycin, corticosteroid, and sivelestat for two weeks. Then he was successfully recovered. The outcome suggests that treatment with corticosteroid and sivelestat, in addition to a combination of appropriate anti-Legionella antibiotics, should be considered for patients with severe Legionella pneumonia with ARDS...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Evaluation of meloxicam, levofloxacin, <b>pazufloxacin,</b> and {{enrofloxacin}} {{for their}} effect on the plasma antioxidative activity (AOA) and the body weight in rabbits. Materials and Methods: Thirty two male Soviet Chinchilla rabbits were divided to eight groups of four rabbits each. Group A, serving as control, was administered 5 % dextrose. Group B, C, E and G were gavaged meloxicam, levofloxacin, <b>pazufloxacin</b> and enrofloxacin, respectively, in 5 % dextrose. Levofloxacin and <b>pazufloxacin</b> were administered at the dose rate of 10 mg/kg body weight b. i. d 12 h, whereas the meloxicam and enrofloxacin were administered at 0. 2 mg/kg body weight o. i. d and 20 mg/kg body weight, respectively. Groups D, F and H were co-gavaged meloxicam with levofloxacin, <b>pazufloxacin,</b> and enrofloxacin, respectively, at the above dose rates. All these drugs were administered for 21 consecutive days. The plasma AOA and body weight was determined on 0, 7, 14, and 21 day of treatment. Results: The plasma AOA of meloxicam treated group was {{significantly lower than the}} control from 7 th day of treatment. On the 14 th day of treatment, the levofloxacin treated group had values significantly higher than the enrofloxacin-meloxicam co-treated group. Except for the levofloxacin treated group, a significant decrease in the antioxidative activity was observed in all treatment groups when compared to the control group on 21 st day of treatment. The body weight of all groups differed non-significantly throughout the study period. Conclusion: The results from this study indicate that although these drugs have no effect on the body weight, a decrease in the plasma AOA is observed, especially when the duration of treatment is increased...|$|E
40|$|Forty-two {{men with}} gonococcal {{urethritis}} {{were treated with}} an oral dosage of 200 mg of <b>pazufloxacin,</b> a new fluoroquinolone, three times daily for 3 days. Only 28 of the 42 men (66. 7 %) had negative culture results for Neisseria gonorrhoeae during follow-up. Of the 42 isolates, 41 could be recultured for antibiotic susceptibility testing and DNA sequencing. In 26 of the 41 isolates (63. 4 %), GyrA mutations with or without ParC mutations were identified. Among the 26 isolates, 23 contained a single GyrA mutation, 1 contained two GyrA mutations, and 2 contained three mutations including double GyrA and single ParC mutations. A single Ser- 91 -to-Phe mutation, which was detected in 14 of the 26 isolates, {{was the most common}} GyrA mutation, followed by an Ala- 75 to Ser mutation and an Asp- 95 to Asn or Gly mutation in GyrA. All three isolates with two or three mutations contained the Ser- 91 -to-Phe GyrA mutation. Eleven of the 14 isolates with the single Ser- 91 -to-Phe mutation within GyrA and all 3 isolates with two or three mutations persisted after <b>pazufloxacin</b> treatment. On the other hand, all 15 wild-type and 9 mutant isolates with a substitution at codon Ala- 75 or Asp- 95 were eradicated. The mean MIC of <b>pazufloxacin</b> for mutants with the single Ser- 91 -to-Phe mutation in GyrA was 66 -fold higher than that for the wild type. The results obtained in this study suggest that a high prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant gonococcal isolates with the Ser- 91 -to-Phe mutation in GyrA reduced the efficacy of <b>pazufloxacin</b> as treatment for gonococcal urethritis...|$|E

40|$|Objective 　To {{study and}} compare the effects of fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, {{moxifloxacin}} and <b>pazufloxacin)</b> on the enzyme system of liver microsome cytochrome P 450 in rat. Methods 　Thirty male Wistar rats were equally assigned into five groups: control group, levofloxacin (LV) group, gatifloxacin (GT) group, moxifloxacin (MX) group and <b>pazufloxacin</b> (PZ) group. Each drug was consecutively administered by tail vein injection for 7 days in a dosage of 120 mg/(kg•d). Liver microsomes were prepared by differential centrifugation, the concentration of protein in the liver microsome was measured by Lowry method, the content and activity of cy tochrome P 450 were detected by spectrophotometric determination, {{and the results were}} analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Results 　Compared with control group, the weight of liver in MX group and GT group was significantly reduced (P 0. 05). Assay of aminopyrine-N-demethylase activity showed that the difference in enzyme activity was statistically significant between the control group and groups LV, GT and MX (P < 0. 01). Erythromycin-N-demethylase activity measurement revealed that the enzyme activity was lowered in GT group and slightly elevated in MX group, and the difference was statistically significant compared with that of control group (P < 0. 01). Measurement of activity of rat liver microsomal CYP 450 enzyme system subfamily showed that the BROD activity increased in LV, MX and PZ groups (P < 0. 01), and slightly decreased in GT group as compared with control group (P < 0. 05). The PROD activity increased in GT group, but decreased in PZ group (P < 0. 01). The EROD activity increased in all the four groups (P < 0. 01). Conclusions 　The four fluoroquinolones have some effects on the enzyme system of liver microsome cytochrome P 450 in rats, but the effects may be different (enhancement or attenuation of the enzymatic activity) depending on the enzymes, and the extent of the decrease of effect is in the following order: gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin and <b>pazufloxacin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Uropathogenic E. coli is a {{major cause}} of urinary tract infections (UTIs), but current {{antibiotics}} do not always effectively clear the persistent infection. To identify drugs that eliminate uropathogenic E. coli persisters, we screened a clinical drug library consisting of 1524 compounds using high throughput drug exposure assay in 96 -well plates. Bacterial survival was assessed by growth on LB plates. We identified 14 drug candidates (tosufloxacin, colistin, sparfloxacin, moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin, enrofloxacin and sarafloxacin, octodrine, clofoctol, dibekacin, cephalosporin C, <b>pazufloxacin,</b> streptomycin and neomycin), which had high anti-persister activity. Among them, tosufloxacin and colistin had the highest anti-persister activity and could completely eradicate E. coli persisters in 3 days in vitro while the current UTI antibiotics failed to do so. Our findings may have implications {{for the development of a}} more effective treatment for UTIs...|$|E
40|$|The {{antibacterial}} {{activities and}} target inhibition of 15 quinolones against grlA and gyrA mutant strains were studied. The strains {{were obtained from}} wild-type Staphylococcus aureus MS 5935 by selection with norfloxacin and nadifloxacin, respectively. The antibacterial activities of most quinolones against both mutant strains were lower than those against the wild-type strain. The ratios of MICs for the gyrA mutant strain to those for the grlA mutant strain (MIC ratio) varied from 0. 125 to 4. The ratios of 50 % inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s) of quinolones against topoisomerase IV to those against DNA gyrase (IC 50 ratios) also varied, from 0. 177 to 5. 52. A significant correlation between the MIC ratios and the IC 50 ratios was observed (r = 0. 919; P 1, and type III quinolones (gatifloxacin, <b>pazufloxacin,</b> moxifloxacin, and clinafloxacin) had MIC ratios of 1. Type I and type II quinolones seem to prefer topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase, respectively. Type III quinolones seem to target both enzymes at nearly the same level in bacterial cells (a phenomenon known as the dual-targeting property), and their IC 50 ratios were approximately 2...|$|E
