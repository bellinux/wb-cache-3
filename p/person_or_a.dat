Packages may include modifications introduced by Debian to achieve compliance with Debian Policy, even to fix non-Debian specific bugs, although coordination with upstream developers is advised.|$|E
5|$|Some of the Kentish crowds now dispersed, {{but others}} continued. From this point, {{they appear to}} have been led by Wat Tyler, whom the Anonimalle Chronicle {{suggests}} was elected their leader at a large gathering at Maidstone on 7 June. Relatively little is known about Tyler's former life; chroniclers suggest that he was from Essex, had served in France as an archer and was a charismatic and capable leader. Several chroniclers believe that he was responsible for shaping the political aims of the revolt. Some also mention a Jack Straw as a leader among the Kentish rebels during this phase in the revolt, but it is uncertain if this was a real <b>person,</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> pseudonym for Wat Tyler or John Wrawe.|$|E
5|$|The delegates couldn't {{agree on}} whether the {{executive}} should be a single <b>person,</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> board of three. Many wished to limit {{the power of the}} executive and thus supported the proposal to divide the executive power between three persons. The possible problems of this system, in addition to the knowledge that George Washington would probably be the first president, calmed the fears enough so that the proponents of a singular executive could accumulate a large coalition. This issue came up occasionally after the matter was settled, but was never again seriously doubted.|$|E

25|$|Diversity of {{language}} is protected and respected by most nations who value cultural diversity. However, people are sometimes subjected to different treatment because their preferred language {{is associated with}} a particular group, class or category. Notable examples are the Anti-French sentiment in the United States as well as the Anti-Quebec sentiment in Canada targeting people who speak the French language. Commonly, the preferred language is just another attribute of separate ethnic groups. Discrimination exists if there is prejudicial treatment against a <b>person</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> group of people who speak a particular language or dialect.|$|E

25|$|The Law on the Freedom of the Press of 29 July 1881 {{guarantees}} {{freedom of}} the press, subject to several prohibitions.

25|$|Emotional target cues {{have been}} shown to {{eliminate}} age differences in prospective memory. For older participants, emotional prospective memory cues were better remembered than neutral cues. Whether the cues are positive or negative, strong emotional attachment makes the cue more self-relevant and easier to remember. For example, an aversive picture of a snake biting a <b>person</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> positive picture of a dog licking its owner are easier to remember because they evoke emotional responses, as opposed to a neutral picture of an animal that does not evoke an emotional response. It is speculated that the amygdala and hippocampus {{may play a role in}} this emotionally enhanced memory effect.|$|E
25|$|A trust {{may have}} {{multiple}} trustees, and these trustees are the legal {{owners of the}} trust's property, but have a fiduciary duty to beneficiaries and various duties, such as a duty of care and a duty to inform. If trustees do not adhere to these duties, they may be removed through a legal action. The trustee may be either a <b>person</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> legal entity such as a company, but typically the trust itself is not an entity and any lawsuit must be against the trustees. A trustee has many rights and responsibilities which vary based on the jurisdiction and trust instrument. If a trust lacks a trustee, a court may appoint a trustee.|$|E

25|$|In some {{traditional}} African religions, morality {{is associated with}} obedience or disobedience to God regarding the way a <b>person</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> community lives. For the Kikuyu, according to their primary supreme creator, Ngai, acting through the lesser deities, is believed to speak to and be capable of guiding the virtuous person as one's conscience. Traditionally, as now, the Kikuyu were monotheists, believing in a unique and omnipotent God whom they called Ngai. The word, {{is related to the}} Maasai word Enkai, and was borrowed by both the Kikuyu and Kamba. God is also known as Mungu, Murungu, or Mulungu (a variant of a word meaning God which is found as far south as the Zambesi of Zambia), and is sometimes given the title Mwathani or Mwathi (the greatest ruler), which comes from the word gwatha, meaning to rule or reign with authority.|$|E
25|$|The {{anticonvulsant}} {{properties of}} potassium bromide were first noted by Sir Charles Locock {{at a meeting}} of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society in 1857. Bromide can be regarded as the first effective medication for epilepsy. At the time, it was commonly thought that epilepsy was caused by masturbation. Locock noted that bromide calmed sexual excitement and thought this was responsible for his success in treating seizures. In the latter half of the 19th century, potassium bromide was used for the calming of seizure and nervous disorders on an enormous scale, with the use by single hospitals being as much as several tons a year (the dose for a given person being a few grams per day). By the beginning of the 20th century the generic word had become so widely associated with being sedate that bromide came to mean a dull, sedate <b>person</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> boring platitude uttered by such a person.|$|E
25|$|An entity (<b>person</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> corporation) may be {{compelled}} to produce documentary evidence {{in accordance with the}} subpoena powers of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 as applied by Bankruptcy Rule 9016. The United States Bankruptcy Court has powers to compel production of documents from a non-debtor corporation or person concerning transactions involving the debtor corporation or person. Production of documents can be challenged as being burdensome. Assets diverted to outside corporations or bank accounts/stock portfolios and such other assets as land holdings lie within the power to compel production under subpoena duces tecum. Federal law recognizes no accountant-client privilege. A subpoena duce tecum served pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 2004 is not a violation of accountant-client privilege. 11 United States Code section 107 (a) provides that papers filed in cases under the Bankruptcy Code and dockets of the Bankruptcy Courts are public records and are to be open to examination at reasonable times without charge.|$|E
