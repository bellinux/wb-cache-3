Firstly, we search optimal batch sizes in a parallel-aisle warehouse with online order arrivals. We employ a sample path optimization and perturbation analysis algorithm to search the optimal batch size for a warehousing service provider, and a central finite difference algorithm to search the optimal batch sizes {{from the perspectives of}} customers and total systems. Secondly, we research a polling-based dynamic order picking system for online retailers. We build models to describe and analyze such systems via stochastic polling theory, find closed-form expressions for the order line waiting times, and apply polling-based picking to online retailers. We then present closed-form analytic expressions for pick rates of order <b>picking</b> <b>bucket</b> brigades systems in different storage profiles, and show how to combine storage policies and bucket brigades protocols to improve order picking productivity. Finally, we propose a new warehouse design approach oriented to improving revenue management of public storage warehouses. Our experiments show a proper facility design can significantly improve the expected revenue of public storage warehouses...|$|E

2500|$|A {{major fire}} {{took place on}} February 27, 1820, that [...] "almost {{destroyed}} the early Ponce settlement". It destroyed 106 [...] "of the best homes in town." [...] In 1823, then Governor of Puerto Rico, Miguel de la Torre mandated that [...] "every male from 16 to 60 years old must be a firefighter". [...] Those firefighters had to supply their own fire fighting equipment (essentially <b>picks,</b> <b>buckets,</b> and shovels). Unfortunately, once De la Torre left office, this first fire fighting institution started to decay.|$|R

Dust clogs drive chain and other parts and must be removed by hand. <b>Picks</b> and <b>bucket</b> lips become overheated by friction and be resharpened or replaced frequently. Addition of oscillating and rotating water jets to pick-and-bucket machine keeps down dust, cools cutting edges, and flushes machine. Rotating jets wash dust away from drive chain.

50|$|Puerto Rico firefighters {{have their}} {{origins in the}} {{southern}} town of Ponce. In 1823, Spanish Governor Miguel De La Torre, became deeply concerned by a large fire that occurred in Ponce, on February 27, 1820. This fire almost destroyed the town. As a result, it became mandatory for every male between 16 and 60 years to be a volunteer firefighter. Firefighters at this time had to provide their own fire-fighting tools such as <b>picks,</b> shovels, and <b>buckets.</b> Unfortunately, this first fire corps saw its decline once Governor De La Torre left his post.|$|R
50|$|Several moments later, {{the cat and}} the rat {{arrive at}} the elderly man's house. They then notice a sign saying window washers are needed. The cat then takes {{a bucket of water}} but the uses the rat as a cloth to wipe the mud stain on the window. When the stain is removed, the cat puts his buddy down. The rat, for some reason, is half-crippled but is still able to walk. Totally annoyed, the rat <b>picks</b> up the <b>bucket</b> and hurls it at the cat. The cat chases the rat into the house.|$|R
5000|$|The Ranger then {{shows the}} bears the {{property}} boundary line between their park and Donald's honey farm. Donald puts up a barbed wire fence {{to keep the}} bears out, but this doesn't stop Humphrey, who uses a sign to prop it up. After failing twice to outsmart the bees, Humphrey uses a hose to try to obtain the honey, but accidentally <b>picks</b> up a <b>bucket</b> of water, which squirts {{in his face and}} catapults, him, Donald and Woodlore into the pond, after which Woodlore hits him on the head and says, [...] "You take too many baths!" ...|$|R
50|$|UDD {{stands for}} Universal-Dig-Dump. It {{represents}} the first fundamental change to draglines {{for almost a}} century, since {{the invention of the}} 'miracle hitch'. Instead of using two ropes (the hoist rope and the drag rope) to manipulate the bucket, a UDD machine uses three ropes, two hoist and one drag. This allows the dragline operator to have much greater selectivity in when to <b>pick</b> up the <b>bucket,</b> and in how the bucket may be dumped. UDD machines generally have higher productivity than a standard dragline, but often have greater mechanical issues. Within the mining industry, there is still much debate as to whether UDD improvements justify their costs.|$|R
5000|$|The honey wagon was {{originally}} a horse-drawn vehicle {{that went through}} back alleys to collect human excreta. Houses at that time did not have flush toilets or indeed any form of indoor sanitation beyond the chamberpot. In rural areas the outhouse (privy) {{is associated with a}} pit latrine of various sorts, but many towns and cities depended on some variant of the pail closet, which needed frequent emptying. At each outdoor toilet, the driver would stop the wagon, flip up the back hatch door (trap-door) of the outhouse, slide out the pail (<b>bucket),</b> <b>pick</b> it up, and dump the contents into one of eight oak half-barrels in the wagon box. The half-barrels had no lids. These toilets were known as dunnies in Australia, hence the [...] "dunnywagon" [...] driven by [...] "dunnymen".|$|R
5000|$|A {{study by}} Dr. Naoko Irie of Tokyo University {{has shown that}} {{elephants}} demonstrate skills at arithmetic. The experiment [...] "consisted of dropping varying numbers of apples into two buckets {{in front of the}} Zoo elephants and then recording how often they could correctly choose the bucket holding the most fruit." [...] When more than one apple was being dropped into the bucket, this meant that the elephants had to [...] "keep running totals in their heads {{to keep track of the}} count." [...] The results showed that [...] "Seventy-four percent of the time, the animals correctly <b>picked</b> the fullest <b>bucket.</b> An African elephant named Ashya scored the highest with an amazing eighty-seven percent … Humans in this same contest managed a success rate of just sixty-seven percent." [...] The study was also filmed to ensure its accuracy.|$|R

Why can't she give me a CD like other mums?)" [...] The doctor, Dr. Parker, also comes to check her over, and tells her {{that it is probably}} just running about in the heatwave, and that even in the early mornings when she goes out she must be careful. She spills out all her woes to Dr. Parker, but feels protective when he <b>picks</b> up the <b>bucket</b> off her windowsill, and feels like something is flowing out of it. He invites her to his garden party, the Greet, next week, and leaves, but when Jess checks the bottom of the bucket again, the base is bare - Epsilon's name and symbol have gone.|$|R
40|$|Bucket brigades ” {{are a way}} {{of sharing}} work on a flow line that results in the {{spontaneous}} emergence of balance and consequent high throughput. All this happens without a work-content model or traditional assembly line balancing technology. Here we show that bucket brigades can be effective even in the presence of variability in the workcontent. In addition, we report confirmation at the national distribution center of a major chain retailer, which experienced a 34 % increase in productivity after the workers began <b>picking</b> orders by <b>bucket</b> brigade. Bucket brigades are a way of coordinating workers who progressively assemble a product along a flow line. Each worker follows this simple rule: Carry work forward from station to station until someone takes over your work; then go backfor more. When the last worker completes a product, he walks back upstream and takes over the work of his predecessor, who then walks back and takes over the workof his predecessor, and so on until the first worker begins a new product {{at the start of the}} line. No unattended work-in-process (WIP) is allowed in the system...|$|R
5000|$|But {{the weight}} of the stand causes Goofy to wobble around, causing Goofy to enter an {{underground}} station and <b>pick</b> up a <b>bucket</b> of motor oil. As Goofy struggles to shake the bucket off, he lets loose several rivets and finally gets the bucket off by sliding on a skateboard. He swings around on a gas pump and heads toward Donald, who puts down a plank of wood for Goofy to cross the underground station. Goofy bangs into Donald and causes Donald to hit a larger oil can, which splatters oil everywhere. Goofy slides around on the oil (his movements looking like he is doing a tap dance) and finally gets off the slick, causing Mickey and the car to crash to the ground, and Goofy gets his head stuck in the lever. Just then, Pete arrives. He pushes Mickey aside and gets into the car, but due to the team's inadequate work, the car won't start. They tiptoe away while Pete is distracted and as they watch the car dismantles itself until only the engine is remaining. The engine moves forward on four [...] "legs" [...] and chases Pete away, banging into him the whole time.|$|R
50|$|Evillene rules {{over the}} yellow {{land of the}} west, enslaving its people, the Winkies. She is evil, power hungry, and ruthlessly {{determined}} to get {{her hands on the}} silver slippers, so that she may increase her power and rule over all of Oz ("Winkie Chant/Don't Nobody Bring Me No Bad News"). Receiving word of Dorothy and her odd friends approaching, she sends her Winged Monkeys to kill them ("Funky Monkeys"). Catching up to the group in the forest surrounding the castle, the monkeys dash the Tin Man against rocks until he falls apart, and rip the straw out of the Scarecrow, leaving both of them helpless. Seeing Dorothy's silver slippers, however, they dare not harm her. Instead, they carry her to Evillene's castle along with the Lion. While searching for a way to get the slippers from Dorothy, the witch forces her and the Lion to do menial chores around the castle. She takes delight in torturing the Lion before Dorothy, threatening to have him skinned unless she hands over the silver slippers. Angered by this, Dorothy <b>picks</b> up a <b>bucket</b> of water and throws it over Evillene, who melts until only her magic golden cap remains. Her spell on the Winkies is lifted, and they show their thanks by restoring the Scarecrow and Tin Man to top condition, and reuniting the four friends ("Everybody Rejoice").|$|R
50|$|A {{little girl}} named Ayşa {{lives with her}} parents on a farm, where they often feed the {{chickens}} or harvest crops. One day, however, there is a terrible tornado. Her dog is locked inside, so she rushes back to the house. But at that moment, strong winds blow the cottage off its foundation and into the sky. When the house lands, she {{opens the front door}} and peeks outside. Given a protective kiss and a pair of silver shoes by the Northern Sorceress and promised aid by seven munchkins, she sets out to find the Great Wizard. Through the grasslands and forests, she encounters Korkuluk (the Scarecrow) and in the forest she meets Teneke Koruadam (the Tin Woodman), and Korkak Aslan (the Cowardly Lion). Keşkin Zeka demands that they kill the Wicked Witch (Kötü Cadı) of the South (Suna Selen) in order to receive their wishes. But Ayşecik and Korkak Aslan are imprisoned in the witch's jail-house after their friends are destroyed by her army of soldiers. Aysecik comes into the jail-house, carrying a heavy, tin bucket but the sets it down as the wicked witch orders her to wash the floor. The girl trips over a string and her left shoe lands on the floor, the wicked witch picks up the shoe and teases Aysecik. Ayesecik <b>picks</b> up her <b>bucket</b> of water and throws it at her, the witch screams as her servants run away but then she begins to tremble, then she finally evaporates into thin air. The witch's former subjects willingly restore Korkuluk and Teneke Koruadam. Back at the Emerald City, Keşkin Zeka admits to being a fraud, delivers trinkets to Ayşecik's friends, and accidentally leaves her behind in his balloon escape, so they set off on their journey again, meeting again the china dolls, the hammer-wielding cavemen (loosely based on Baum's Hammerheads) and then start to dance, then, after the Good Sorceress tells her how to use her shoes, Aysecik bids farewell to her friends, clicks her heels, and ends up home.|$|R
