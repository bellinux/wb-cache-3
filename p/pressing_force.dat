50|$|A {{common cause}} of {{brinelling}} {{is the use of}} improper installation procedures. Brinelling often occurs when pressing bearings into holes or onto shafts. Care must usually be taken to ensure that pressure is applied to the proper bearing race to avoid transferring the pressure from one race to the other through the balls or rollers. If <b>pressing</b> <b>force</b> is applied to the wrong race, brinelling can occur to either or both of the races. The act of pressing or clamping can also leave brinell marks, especially if the vise or press has serrated jaws or roughened surfaces. Flat pressing plates are often used in the pressing of bearings, while soft copper, brass, or aluminum jaw covers are often used in vises to help avoid brinell marks from being forced into the workpiece.|$|E

40|$|Experimental and {{numerical}} simulation studies {{were carried out}} to enhance the understanding of the compaction behaviour of powder materials and to study the breakage behaviour of tablets after compaction. In order to simulate powder compaction and post compaction behaviour an appropriate constitutive model is required. To calibrate the constitutive model (e. g. a Drucker-Prager Cap model) a series of experiments were carried out including closed die compaction, uniaxial and diametrical compression tests. A newly developed apparatus consisting of a die instrumented with radial stress sensors was used to determine constitutive parameters as well as friction properties between the powder and die wall. The calibration of constitutive models requires accurate stress-strain curves. During die compaction the deformation of the powder material is determined by considering the elastic deformation (or compliance) of the system. The effect of different compliance correction methods was evaluated with regards to the accuracy of models predicting the <b>pressing</b> <b>forces.</b> A method for accounting for non-homogeneous stress states in instrumented die compaction was also developed. A complete data extraction procedure was presented. The breakage behaviour of flat and curved faced tablets was investigated and the breakage patterns of tablets were examined by X-Ray computed tomography. An empirical equation that relates the material strength to the break force was proposed. The constitutive model was implemented into the finite element package Abaqus/Standard to simulate powder compaction and breakage. A range of failure criteria have been evaluated for predicting break force of flat and curved faced tablets under diametrical compression.
