The article considers that a ‘business as usual’ type of response is insufficient in these circumstances and more radical corporate governance reforms should be considered. Two issues deserve particular attention. First, board composition and competence must be addressed and the value of shareholder engagement on this issue is considered. Secondly, and more radically, the case is made for setting up a <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> oversight <b>body</b> under the umbrella of the FRC to have oversight of corporate governance issues in publicly traded companies. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Public private {{partnerships}} (PPPs) are {{instruments of}} the <b>public</b> <b>interest,</b> yet <b>bodies</b> that actively engage private actors. As a result, questions of governance are particularly important. Here, governance {{refers to the}} rules that prescribe who should make, execute and be accountable {{for the conduct of}} a PPP, and in what way that conduct should be exercised, for example through consultation with interested parties, transparency in decision-making, and so on. This chapter explores four facets of PPP governance: legal, regulatory, democratic, and corporate governance. Legal governance has implications for the allocation of roles and responsibilities between the parties to the PPP, the PPP entity itself, and the state and citizens more widely. Regulatory governance covers the legal and contractual obligations on parties, the procedures through which they are enforced, and the softer norms that operate around these. Democratic governance concerns the empirical and normative question of what is, and what should be, the level and form of constitutional oversight of PPPs. Corporate governance concerns itself with ensuring that the enterprise is managed in a manner that does not put the future of the business and investors funds at undue risk. The chapter concludes that the key task in developing the governance of PPPs is less to do with their financial probity, and more with aligning their mode of operating to the fundamental democratic values of the wider public service...|$|R

The {{effectiveness of the}} Overseas Development Aid (ODA) has become a topic of great <b>public</b> <b>interest.</b> A growing <b>body</b> of experience exists to demonstrate that finance alone is not sufficient for development, and capacity and knowledge are increasingly seen as the constraints to proper decision making, adsorption of funds, and effective results on the ground. This book presents {{the investigation into the}} role of Knowledge and Capacity Development (KCD) in public water management in Indonesia and the Netherlands. The two cases indicate that the institutional environment matters for the type of knowledge and capacities that are allowed and also determines the formal organisational structure and KCD mechanisms in use. They further show the importance yet the low valuation of tacit knowledge, while the Indonesian case also shows that tacit knowledge is the most important asset gained from international post-graduate education. The conceptual model introduced in this book has provided a measure of knowledge and capacity at three nested levels: the institutional, organisational and individual level. It provides insight in the numerous contextual factors that influence knowledge and capacity and KCD mechanisms present. Water ManagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|OF THE DISSERTATION ON "PUBLIC INTEREST IN ENVIRONMENTAL LAW" Zdeněk Horáček, 2011 The {{dissertation}} examines <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> {{in environmental}} law. Due {{to the lack}} of professional resources dealing with the very concept of <b>public</b> <b>interest,</b> the dissertation offers its basic definition and relevant connections, but always in relation to the institutes of the environmental law. Interpretive and historical aspects of <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> are analyzed and basic definition features, classification and process of the formulation of <b>public</b> <b>interest,</b> including correction of the improper process, are established. The dissertation specifies <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in environmental law as a legally defined value of environmental protection shared by whole society. Such a <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> is promoted in all the phases of evaluation and authorization of a project that may be harmful to the environment, in the extent always depending on the specific situation. The dissertation concludes that environmental protection is a worldwide shared value and <b>public</b> <b>interest.</b> In addition, <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in environmental protection is a criterion for a decision making process carried out by public authorities, and the resulting <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> (adopted solution) depends on the specific circumstances of the situation...|$|R

40|$|As {{a set of}} {{economic}} activities, tourism trades {{on the character of}} special places. Conflict can emerge where local residents perceive that tourism development proposals challenge the special qualities of place, and where place meaning and attachments are compromised. A key function of government in mediating conflict is to protect <b>public</b> <b>interests,</b> yet explicit consideration of <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in tourism development conflict is unusual. This paper argues for a reinvigoration of <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in the mediation of tourism development conflicts. It explores the concept of <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> and how governments interpret and give meaning to it in development debates. In a case study of a cruise ship terminal proposal on the Gold Coast, Australia, the state adopted a neoliberal interpretation of <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> wherein increased global competitiveness of the destination was the overriding common good pursued. Local and diverse interests were marginalised in the debate. The paper concludes that in order to reinvigorate <b>public</b> <b>interest,</b> a <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> evaluation framework for tourism development is needed...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{the use of}} <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> factors in merger analysis. We begin with {{a review of the}} use of such factors in jurisdictions around the world and then focus on the U. S.

Although we do not advocate a ready embrace of <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> considerations, we do think that the Wal-Mart/Massmart decision provides insight into how jurisdictions that consider <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> factors might usefully do so. Based on the lessons learned from these two cases, we conclude with a discussion of the appropriate norms that jurisdictions should follow when taking account of <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in merger enforcement, with particular emphasis on clear articulation of <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> goals, transparency of process, and quantification of costs and benefits...|$|R

40|$|Due {{to legal}} {{uncertainty}} surrounding {{the application of}} key provisions of European and UK data protection law, the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in protecting individuals’ informational privacy is routinely neglected, as are the <b>public</b> <b>interests</b> in certain uses of data. Consent or anonymisation are often treated as the paradigmatic example of compliance with data protection law, even though both are unable {{to attend to the}} full range of rights and interests at stake in data processing. Currently, where data processing may serve a realisable <b>public</b> <b>interest,</b> and consent or anonymisation are impracticable (if not impossible to obtain) the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> conditions to processing are the rational alternative justifications for processing. However, the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> conditions are poorly defined in the legislation, and misunderstood and neglected in practice. This thesis offers a much-needed alternative to the predominant consent-or-anonymise paradigm by providing a new understanding of the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> concept in data protection law and to suggest a new approach to deploying the concept {{in a way that is}} consistent with the protective and facilitative aims of the legislation. Through undertaking legislative analysis new insight is provided on the purpose of the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> conditions in data protection law, revealing critical gaps in understanding. By engaging with <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> theory and discovering the conceptual contours of the <b>public</b> <b>interest,</b> these gaps are addressed. Combined with the insight obtained from the legislative history, we can determine the reasonable range of circumstances and types of processing where it may be justifiable to use personal data based on the <b>public</b> <b>interest.</b> On this basis, and to develop a new approach for deploying the concept, other legal uses of the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> are examined. The lessons learned suggest legislative and procedural elements that are critical to successful deployment of the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> concept in data protection. The thesis concludes with the identification of key components to allow a clearer understanding of the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in this field. Further, these insights enable recommendations to be made, to reform the law, procedure and guidance. In doing so, the concept of the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> can be confidently deployed in line with the aims of data protection law, to both protect and facilitate the use of personal data...|$|R
