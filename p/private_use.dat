It was then bought by Douglas Wills, who donated {{it and the}} rectory field to Winford Hospital as a convalescent home for 16 children. It was later used as a nurses' home before being sold for <b>private</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
5|$|The bucentaur {{was used}} {{not only for}} the Marriage of the Sea ceremony, but also for other state {{functions}} such as festivals celebrating the Virgin Mary and the bearing of newly crowned dogaressas (the wives of doges) to the Doge's Palace. On 6 May 1401, a law was passed to prohibit the doge from making <b>private</b> <b>use</b> of the bucentaur.|$|E
5|$|The De Beatis description, only rediscovered by Steppe in the 1960s, cast {{new light}} on the {{commissioning}} of a work that was previously thoughtsince it has no central religious imageto be an atypical altarpiece. Many Netherlandish diptychs intended for <b>private</b> <b>use</b> are known, and even a few triptychs, but the Bosch panels are unusually large compared with these and contain no donor portraits. Possibly they were commissioned to celebrate a wedding, as large Italian paintings for private houses frequently were. Nevertheless, The Gardens bold depictions do not rule out a church commission, such was the contemporaneous fervor to warn against immorality. In 1566, the triptych served as the model for a tapestry that hangs at El Escorial monastery near Madrid.|$|E
40|$|Gold {{has both}} <b>private</b> <b>uses</b> (depletion uses and service uses) and {{government}} uses. It {{can be obtained}} from mines with high extraction costs (about $ 300 per ounce) or from above ground stocks with no extraction costs. Governments still store massive stocks of gold. Making government gold available for <b>private</b> <b>uses</b> through some combination of sales and loans raises welfare from <b>private</b> <b>uses</b> by removing two types of inefficiencies. For given <b>private</b> <b>uses,</b> there is a production inefficiency if costless government gold is withheld while costly gold is taken from mines. There are use inefficiencies if costless government gold is withheld from private users. We assess both qualitatively and quantitatively the gain in welfare and its distribution.

5|$|The Sable Island horse, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Sable Island pony, is a type of small feral horse found on Sable Island, an island off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. It is a small type, often pony sized, but with a horse phenotype and horse ancestors, and usually dark in color. The first horses were released on the island in the late eighteenth century, and soon became feral. Additional horses were later transported to improve the herd's breeding stock. They were rounded up for <b>private</b> <b>use</b> and sale for slaughter, which by the 1950s had placed them in danger of extinction.|$|E
5|$|The new rectory {{was built}} by the Reverend John Ellershaw in the 1870s. The last rector to occupy it was Lionel St. Clair Waldy from 1907 to 1945. It was then bought by Douglas Wills who donated it and the rectory field to Winford Hospital as a convalescent home for 16 children, and later used as a nurses' home before being sold for <b>private</b> <b>use.</b> Primarily an {{orthopaedic}} hospital, Winford was built in 1930, and became a part-military and part-civilian hospital. Wards A to D were for civilian use, while wards E to K, added {{to the hospital in}} 1940, were for the treatment of service and civilian war casualties. The hospital closed in 1996, and the rectory is now divided into several residential units.|$|E
5|$|Vespasian {{started his}} own {{redevelopment}} of the site around AD70 to 72, possibly funding the construction with booty seized after the Roman victory in the First Jewish-Roman War in AD70. The lake was in-filled and the site designated as the location for the Flavian Amphitheatre. Reverting the <b>private</b> <b>use</b> by Nero to a more popular social purpose of a colosseum raised Vespasian's popularity. Gladiatorial schools (ludi) and other support buildings were later constructed within the former grounds of the Domus Aurea, much {{of which had been}} torn down.|$|E

5|$|After the {{original}} {{contract with the}} state was terminated, a new agreement {{for the production of}} 650 vehicles to be delivered between 1948 and 1952 was reached. The state helped production with a significant prepayment of 132 million marks. According to the contract, 150 vehicles were scheduled to be built in 1948. The company reached this target and made a further 11 vehicles for <b>private</b> <b>use.</b> 92 were sold under the name of Sisu S-22 or S-22K and 69 were badged as Vanaja V-48. 101 M2 Half-Tracks were sold. In 1948, VAT made a loss of 746,000 marks. In 1949, VAT made another 150 vehicles for the state and 37 vehicles for private operators; it produced 163 V-48s and 24 VaWhs. The company also sold 211 M2 Half-Tracks, allowing it to declare its first profit of 1.208 million marks, which was helped by a devaluation of the Finnish mark.|$|E
5|$|Public {{perception}} of the national flag varies. Historically, both Western and Japanese sources claimed the flag was a powerful and enduring symbol to the Japanese. Since the end of World War II (the Pacific War), {{the use of the}} flag and the national anthem Kimigayo has been a contentious issue for Japan's public schools. Disputes about their use have led to protests and lawsuits. The flag is not frequently displayed in Japan due to its association with ultranationalism. To Okinawans, the flag represents the events of World WarII and the subsequent U.S. military presence there. For some nations that have been occupied by Japan, the flag is a symbol of aggression and imperialism. The Hi no maru was used as a tool against occupied nations for purposes of intimidation, asserting Japan's dominance, or subjugation. Several military banners of Japan are based on the Hi no maru, including the sunrayed Naval Ensign. The Hi no maru also serves as a template for other Japanese flags in public and <b>private</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
