25|$|The NTSB was {{initially}} unable {{to resolve the}} cause of the crash, but after similar accidents and incidents involving Boeing 737 aircraft, the crash was determined to be caused by a defect {{in the design of the}} 737's rudder <b>power</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (PCU).|$|E
25|$|According to {{the series}} Mayday, the rudder issue had been {{corrected}} before construction started on the accident aircraft.

25|$|Starting in 1991, several {{accidents}} and incidents involving the Boeing 737 {{were the result of}} uncommanded movement of their rudders. On 3 March 1991, United Airlines Flight 585, a 737-200, crashed in Colorado Springs, Colorado, killing 25 people. On 8 September 1994, USAir Flight 427, a 737-300, crashed near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, killing 132 people. There were four more incidents where a 737 rudder <b>power</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (PCU) malfunction was suspected.|$|E
25|$|The FCV concept {{also uses}} {{portions}} of Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive technology including the electric motor, <b>power</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> {{and other parts}} and components from its hybrid vehicles to improve reliability and minimize cost. The hybrid technology {{is also used to}} work together with the fuel cell. At low speeds such as city driving, the FCV runs just like any all-electric car by using the energy stored in its battery, which is charged through regenerative braking. At higher speeds, the hydrogen fuel cell alone powers the electric motor. When more power is needed, for example during sudden acceleration, the battery supports the fuel cell system as both work together to provide propulsion.|$|E
25|$|Another {{potential}} {{factor that}} led to the crash of the 737 aircraft was the <b>power</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (PCU) that controlled the aircraft's rudder. The cause of some 737 crashes such as USAir Flight 427 had been attributed to the 737's rudder issues. Although the NTSB and PCU manufacturer Parker Hannifin had already determined that the PCU was properly working, and thus not the cause of the crash, a private investigation into the crash for a civil lawsuit tried by jury in a California state court in Los Angeles, which was not allowed to hear or consider the NTSB's and Parker Hannifin's conclusions, decided that the crash was caused by a defective servo valve inside the PCU, based on forensic findings from an electron microscope which determined that minute defects within the PCU had caused the rudder hard-over and a subsequent uncontrollable flight and crash. The manufacturer of the aircraft's rudder controls and the families later reached an out-of-court settlement.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the flight}} data {{recorder}} (FDR) outer protective case was damaged, the data tape inside was intact and all the data was recoverable. Five parameters were recorded by the FDR: heading, altitude, airspeed, normal acceleration (G loads), and microphone keying. [...] The FDR did not record rudder, aileron or spoiler deflection data, which could have aided the NTSB in reconstructing the plane's final moments. The data available proved insufficient to establish why the plane suddenly went into the fatal dive. The NTSB considered the possibilities of a malfunction of the rudder <b>power</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> servo (which might have caused the rudder to reverse) {{and the effect of}} powerful rotor winds from the nearby Rocky Mountains might have had, but there was not enough evidence to prove either hypothesis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Insight had {{a conventional}} manual transmission. Starting with the 2001 model, a CVT {{variant of the}} Insight was available; the CVT {{is similar to that}} used in the Honda Civic Hybrid and the Honda Logo. A traditional transmission shifts between a fixed set of engine-to-wheel ratios; however, a CVT allows for an infinite set of ratios between its lowest gear and its highest. A feature shared by the two hybrids (and now appearing in others) is the ability to automatically turn off the engine when the vehicle is at a stop (and restart it upon movement). Since it is more powerful than most starters of conventional cars, the Insight's electric motor can start the engine nearly instantaneously. The Integrated Motor Assist is run by an [...] "Intelligent Power Unit (IPU)", a desktop computer-sized box. The Intelligent Power Unit, the <b>Power</b> <b>control</b> <b>Unit,</b> the Electronic Control Unit, the vehicle's batteries, dc-to-dc converter and a high-voltage inverter are all located under the cargo floor of the vehicle, behind the seats.|$|E

2500|$|The Egyptian report {{suggested}} several {{control failure}} scenarios as possible {{causes of the}} crash, focusing on a possible failure {{of one of the}} right elevator's <b>power</b> <b>control</b> <b>units.</b> While the NTSB's report did not determine a specific reason for the relief first officer's alleged actions, their report stated the impact was [...] "a result of the relief first officer's flight control inputs". Supporting its deliberate-act conclusion, the NTSB report determined that no mechanical failure scenario could result in aircraft movements that matched those recorded by the flight data recorder (FDR), and that even had any of the failure scenarios put forward by the Egyptian authorities occurred, the aircraft would still have been recoverable because of the 767's redundant elevator control system.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. High {{temperature}} SiC devices {{require the}} materials for packaging also capable of working at higher temperature {{than those for}} Si devices. SiC devices are expected to help hybrid vehicle <b>power</b> <b>control</b> <b>units</b> (PCUs) produce higher power in a more compact size as SiC can withstand higher voltages and temperatures (above 300 Â°C) than silicon with less power loss. The improvement of interconnection technologies is increasingly becoming a top priority, particularly for the operation of SiC devices at relatively high temperatures. We propose a new interconnection method using nickel electroplating to replace Al wire bonding or die-bonding using solder materials. During {{the evaluation of the}} reliability of interconnections annealed at up to 500 Â°C, we observed no significant changes in mechanical or electrical properties. We found that micro-plating connections can be used successfully for high-temperature-resistant packaging for SiC devices...|$|R
