40|$|In recent years, <b>public-to-private</b> {{transaction}} (going private transaction) {{has become}} a common practice in Taiwan''s business models. However, what are the problems of this business model? How should the legal system regulate it? In the U. S. A., the development and academic studies of the concept and regulations of <b>public-to-private</b> transaction are mature. This thesis hopes to help readers to understand the problems and regulation of <b>public-to-private</b> transaction by researching the concept and regulations of <b>public-to-private</b> transaction in the United States. Chapter one includes the motive, the purpose, the range, the methodology of the research and the analysis of related domestic papers {{in order to make}} readers understand where the questions are in the topic. Chapter two describes the concept, motive, and means of the <b>public-to-private</b> transaction in the U. S.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an exhaustive literature {{review of the}} motives for <b>public-to-private</b> LBO transactions. First, the paper develops the theoretical framework for the potential sources of value creation from going private: a distinction is made between the reduction in agency costs, stakeholder wealth transfers, tax benefits, transaction costs savings, takeover defense strategies, and corporate undervaluation. The paper then reviews and summarizes whether and how these theories have been empirically verified in the four different strands of literature in LBO research. These strands of literature are categorized by phase in the LBO transaction: Intent (of a buyout), Impact (of the LBO on the various stakeholders), Process (of restructuring after the leveraged buyout) and Duration (of retaining the private status). Then, the paper shows {{that in the first}} half of the 2000 s, a <b>public-to-private</b> LBO wave re-emerged in the US, UK and Continental Europe, whose value vastly exceeded that of the 1980 s US LBO wave.

40|$|I {{investigate}} {{the sources of}} value gains in <b>public-to-private</b> transactions by examining the wealth effects on industry rivals of target firms. For a sample of 279 <b>public-to-private</b> bids in the U. S. from 1980 to 2007, I find that agency hypothesis explains more of the cross-sectional variation in rival firms’ abnormal returns at the initial bid announcements than the other suggested hypotheses. For rival firms with Tobin’s q (less than one), abnormal returns are positively related to the firms’ cash holdings before the relevant buyout bids and to the decline in cash holdings from before to after the bids. The median portfolio of rival firms with low Tobin’s q and above-median cash holdings reduces cash holdings and capital spending significantly after a buyout bid in the industry and experiences improved return on assets. Although the median portfolio in the entire sample of rival firms reduces cash holdings and capital spending significantly after a buyout bid, only that with low Tobin’s q and above-median cash holdings experiences significantly-increased return on assets. Also, rival firms that are subsequent targets within one year of buyout bids in their industries earn higher abnormal returns at the bid announcements. Rival firms with low Tobin’s q and low sales growth have higher likelihoods of becoming targets within one year of buyout bids in their industries. These findings suggest that rival firms that {{are more prone to}} agency conflicts are perceived to be more likely candidates for future private buyouts and that they improve returns on assets in response to buyout threats, implying that agency cost savings is a source of value in <b>public-to-private</b> transactions. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT ESSAYS ON REVERSE LEVERAGED BUYOUTS by MARK GRUSKIN August 2011 Advisor: Dr. Sudip Datta Major: Business Administration (Finance) Degree: Doctor of Philosophy This {{dissertation}} is {{the first}} study to investigate <b>public-to-private</b> reverse leveraged buyouts (RLBOs). The first essay measures changes in profitability, financial structure, operations, and cost structure to detect actions taken during the private period. Results show that approaching the leveraged buyout there is an above industry level of free cash flow and capital expenditures, while growth options are at competitive levels. These factors {{in the presence of}} low ownership concentration suggest the existence of overinvestment. Increased leverage in the private period leads to significant declines in free cash flow and capital expenditures, while ownership concentration increases, which I contend incentivizes management to avoid overinvestment. I find that private period restructuring that improves growth and reduces cost structure leads to superior post-RLBO valuations. Further, even though free cash flow increases as leverage decreases, management retains the discipline to invest in projects that generate positive future cash flows. The second essay investigates long-run stock returns of <b>public-to-private</b> RLBOs. First, I examine whether RLBOs suffer from the same long-run underperformance characteristic of IPOs. Then, following up on the results in Chapter 2 that identifies the determinants of post-RLBO valuation, I investigate what firm characteristics are related to stock returns after the offering. Finally, I investigate whether underwriters perform the certification role found for first IPOs. The findings demonstrate that <b>public-to-private</b> RLBOs earns stock returns that outperform IPOs in comparable industries, with little evidence of market mispricing. As these RLBOs were previously exchange listed, I argue that reduced information asymmetry ameliorates the underperformance found for IPOs. The evidence suggests that restructuring that creates growth has the same beneficial impact on stock performance as for valuation. I also find that private period actions that reduce cost structure lead to positive stock returns after the RLBO. I find that executive committees {{of the board of directors}} are discounted by the market, leading to lower stock returns. Further, underwriter quality of RLBOs is generally higher than that of IPOs, and is positively correlated with stock performance. Public offerings by higher quality underwriters earn positive abnormal stock returns over long horizons...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{in an informal}} way the <b>Public-To-Private</b> (P 2 P) approach to interorganizational workflows, {{which is based on}} a notion of inheritance. The approach consists of three steps: (1) create a common understanding of the interorganizational workflow by specifying a shared public workflow, (2) partition the public workflow over the organizations involved, and (3) for each organization, create a private workflow which is a subclass of the respective part of the public workflow. Using an example, we explain that the P 2 P approach yields an interorganizational workflow which is guaranteed to realize the behavior specified in the public workflow. ...|$|E
40|$|Managers {{have the}} choice to take the firm private {{themselves}} in a management buyout or to seek private equity backing. We argue that managers seek private equity backing in case they are more constrained to finance the deal themselves. We confirm the hypothesis using a sample of UK <b>public-to-private</b> transactions over the period 1997 – 2003. A post going private performance analysis reveals that both management buyouts and private equity backed deals outperform their industry peers. However, private equity backed deals outperform their peers already before the deal takes place whereas management buyouts improve performance afterwards. This suggests a passive role for private equity firms in going private transactions...|$|E
40|$|In a <b>public-to-private</b> (PTP) acquisition, the {{gained control}} and the {{capabilities}} of the private equity investor affect strategic management of the firm and its value. We examine the role of idiosyncratic investor capabilities in the value appropriation from PTPs and provide implications for the changing market for private equity. Next to the traditional sources of value, we incorporate and value entrepreneurial aspects, investor specialisation, path-dependency and levering the private investor’s core competencies. Due to competition and replicability an increasing part of value creation in PTPs is reflected in the acquisition premium. As a result, we expect more specialization in private equity to lever idiosyncratic capabilities, as can be observed in buy-and-build strategies. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper studies {{what drives}} firms to {{voluntary}} delist from capital markets and what differs in firms ’ behavior and fundamentals between <b>public-to-private</b> transactions and M&A deals with listed corporations. Moreover, I study {{the relationship between}} ownership percentage in controlling shareholders ’ hands and cumulative returns around the delisting public announcement. I perform my tests both for the Italian and the US markets and I compare the findings to better understand how the phenomenon works in these different institutional environments. Consistent with my expectations, I find that the likelihood of delisting is mainly related to size, underperformance and undervaluation, while shareholders are more rewarded when their companies are involved in PTP transactions than in M&As with public firms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Management buy-outs {{have become}} a global phenomenon. This paper {{examines}} the key market trends in the UK and Continental Europe and identifies challenges for the future development of the market. Key recent trends include: buy-out funds raised have exceeded funds invested; evidence from Continental Europe indicates an intention by institutional investors to increase their commitment; private equity firms from the United States have become more prominent investors in European buy-outs; increased competition has come from hedge funds and new entrants such as government-sponsored operators, family offices and wealthy entrepreneurs; major changes in deals have been the growth of secondary buy-outs and <b>public-to-private</b> buy-outs; recent lower interest rates {{have been associated with}} a rise in debt; size of deal syndicates is increasing in very large deals; average share price reaction to the PTP announcement in the UK during 1997 - 2003 was 30 %; secondary buy-outs {{have become a}}n important exit route, and there is an increasing number of tertiary or quaternary buy-outs. Future challenges include: realizing the scope for attractive deals from restructuring larger corporations in Continental Europe; encouraging succession planning that will result in buy-outs involving family-owned firms; further differentiation between private equity firms in order to generate upside gains; addressing the competitive challenge to existing financiers from hedge funds; reconciling concerns about the medium term economic performance of European economies and the degree of leverage in buy-out deals; and secondary buy-outs raise major challenges relating to whether managers are buyers or sellers, and the attitudes of limited partners.

40|$|Abstract: This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three chapters on private equity (PE) investments. The first chapter studies the earnings manipulation preceding the <b>public-to-private</b> leveraged buyouts (LBOs), the incentives underlying the earnings manipulation, {{and the effectiveness of}} accounting regulation (the revised Corporate Governance Code of 2003) on alleviating earnings manipulation. The second and third chapters focus on the private-to-private LBOs (private LBOs). Chapter 2 investigates why some private LBOs are backed by PE firms (rather than by banks) and how these deals fare in the aftermath. Chapter 3 examines the role of private equity firms in the build-up of professional teams as well as leadership changes in private LBOs. I document that the human capital role of PE investors goes beyond that of the traditional financial institutions that provide capital and monitoring. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. When a peer in {{a public}} network opens a {{connection}} to another one being behind a network address translator, it encounters the network address translation problem. So called “UDP hole punching ” approach allows to open a <b>public-to-private</b> or private-to-private network connection. This article deals with this approach to propose new security architecture for IPv 4 communica-tion introducing so called “implicit security ” concept. Main contributions are ability to interconnect to any host behind NAT using just a host’s domain name, enhanced mobility, and encryption and authentication of all data transmitted through this connection right from a packet sender to a local receiver. Secure channel is established on-demand automatically and is independent on any ap-plication. No additional modification of current NAT, IPv 4 or DNS is required. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} the performance of <b>Public-to-private</b> leveraged buy-outs during the recent period of recession. With the recent degradation of the UK economy, we can rightly assume that these types of highly leverage transactions have been enduring issues to service their substantial debt. Therefore, we suppose they have suffered from liquidity and solvency problems and thus underperformed comparable companies remained public in terms of profitability, efficiency and growth. Following the approaches of recent papers on Leveraged buy-outs, we compare the adjusted performance of this specific form of leveraged buy-outs to the performance of similar transactions conducted in the early 2000 s and the performance of comparable public companies. The positive contribution of private equity firms to the performance of these highly leveraged transactions is also under study...|$|E
