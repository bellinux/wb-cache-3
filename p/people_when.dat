5|$|Based on {{research}} on findings made there, the lake did support a substantial population that relied mostly on {{resources from the}} lake, including aquaculture and fishing.

According to the CLEAR framework, <b>people</b> participate <b>when</b> they can: when they have the resources necessary to make their argument. <b>People</b> participate <b>when</b> they feel part of something: they like to participate because it is central to their sense of identity. They participate when they are enabled {{to do so by}} an infrastructure of civic networks and organisations. <b>People</b> participate <b>when</b> they are directly asked for their opinion.

5|$|According to the {{prevailing}} classification scheme by Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman, the first division occurred around 2200 BCE, when Huastecan split away from Mayan proper after its speakers moved northwest along the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Proto-Yucatecan and Proto-Ch'olan speakers subsequently split off from the main group and moved north into the Yucatán Peninsula. Speakers of the western branch moved south into the areas now inhabited by Mamean and Quichean <b>people.</b> <b>When</b> speakers of proto-Tzeltalan later separated from the Ch'olan group and moved south into the Chiapas highlands, they {{came into contact with}} speakers of Mixe–Zoque languages. According to an alternative theory by Robertson and Houston, Huastecan stayed in the Guatemalan highlands with speakers of Ch'olan-Tzeltalan, separating from that branch at a much later date than proposed by Kaufman.|$|E
5|$|Another origin tale {{claims that}} King Solomon {{was given a}} pure Arabian-type mare named Safanad ("the pure") by the Queen of Sheba.

This legendary stallion was said to be faster than the zebra and the gazelle, and every hunt with him was successful, thus when he was put to stud, he became a founding sire of legend.|$|E

This prophecy was again present {{in the minds of many}} <b>people,</b> <b>when</b> only three months after the dynasty's 150th anniversary celebrations the Siamese revolution of 1932 was carried out. The revolution replaced the absolute monarchy of the Chakri monarchs with a constitutional monarchy with Siam's first constitution.|$|E

5|$|Botanists {{study how}} plants produce food {{and how to}} {{increase}} yields, for example through plant breeding, making their work important to mankind's ability to feed the world and provide food security for future generations. Botanists also study weeds, which are a considerable problem in agriculture, and the biology and control of plant pathogens in agriculture and natural ecosystems. Ethnobotany {{is the study of}} the relationships between plants and <b>people.</b> <b>When</b> applied to the investigation of historical plant–people relationships ethnobotany may be referred to as archaeobotany or palaeoethnobotany. Some of the earliest plant-people relationships arose between the indigenous people of Canada in identifying edible plants from inedible plants. This relationship the indigenous people had with plants was recorded by ethnobotanists.|$|E

5|$|Heavy metals can degrade air, water, {{and soil}} quality, and {{subsequently}} cause health issues in plants, animals, and <b>people,</b> <b>when</b> they become concentrated {{as a result}} of industrial activities. Common sources of heavy metals in this context include mining and industrial wastes; vehicle emissions; lead-acid batteries; fertilisers; paints; and treated timber; aging water supply infrastructure; and microplastics floating in the world's oceans. Recent examples of heavy metal contamination and health risks include the occurrence of Minamata disease, in Japan (1932–1968; lawsuits ongoing as of 2016); the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster in Brazil, and high levels of lead in drinking water supplied to the residents of Flint, Michigan, in the north-east of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Hurricanes Arlene and Chloe, as well {{as several}} {{tropical}} depressions, originated from tropical waves that left the coast of Africa.

In late September, Tropical Storm Edith was a minimal storm that moved through the Lesser Antilles without serious impact. Hurricane Fern killed three <b>people</b> <b>when</b> it struck Mexico north of Tampico.

It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, Rollin Woodyatt {{reviewed}} {{the research on}} diet and diabetes. He reported that three water-soluble compounds, β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone (known collectively as ketone bodies), were produced by the liver in otherwise healthy <b>people</b> <b>when</b> they were starved or if they consumed a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Russel Wilder, at the Mayo Clinic, built on this research and coined the term ketogenic diet to describe a diet that produced {{a high level of}} ketone bodies in the blood (ketonemia) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate. Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely. His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy.|$|E
