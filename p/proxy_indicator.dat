40|$|More {{than half}} a century after the liberation of the {{majority}} of African countries, Africa is facing major socio-economic challenges including unemployment, slow economic growth and inequality. With waves of violent service delivery protests {{over the last few years}} throughout South Africa, it is now more than ever vital to identify the key challenges to development and the ways to overcome these trials. The importance of plans for development, and that reliable data plays an essential role in development have been wildly discussed, especially as the legitimacy and reliability of plans are highly dependent upon the quality of the data utilised. Even though data plays such a significant role in development, quality up to date data is expensive, difficult to obtain and in many instances not available. Furthermore, South Africa and many developing countries do not have the luxury of such data, nor the skills and resources to develop high quality statistics on a regular basis. In the light of the importance of accurate up-to-date data for planning and the lack of the aforementioned data in South Africa, the dissertation explores means of ‘accessing’ high quality up-to-date data by the use of ‘proxy indicators’. The dissertation seeks to explore whether it would be possible to use <b>proxy</b> <b>indicators</b> to measure local economic conditions and to identify a set of <b>proxy</b> <b>indicators</b> that accurately portray the economy. The study commences with an analysis on the relationship between a number of <b>proxy</b> <b>indicators</b> and the national economy in order to identify a set of <b>proxy</b> <b>indicators</b> that accurately portrays the economy where after the accurate indicators is empirically tested to that of the local economy in three study areas. The study established that six <b>proxy</b> <b>indicators</b> can be used to measure the local economy in South Africa. These are the (1) number of middle class residential properties sold, (2) growth in residential building activity, (3) retail sales of durable goods including business profit, (4) hardware sales including business profit, (5) volume of sales of spare parts for vehicles and (6) fuel consumption. Apart from the fact that the indicators mirror the economy to a high degree, a number of trends with regards to the dynamics of the relationship between the indicator and the economy were revealed. The study demonstrated that there is merit in further studies regarding the use of <b>proxy</b> <b>indicators</b> in planningDissertation (MTRP) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013. gm 2014 Town and Regional Planningunrestricte...|$|R

Eddy {{but much of the}} content referencing him can be found under his nickname Jack which he preferred to use. In 1976 Dr. Eddy published a landmark paper in Science titled [...] "The Maunder Minimum" [...] where, using the Nineteenth Century works of Edward W. Maunder and Gustav Spörer, he identified a 70-year period from 1645 to 1715 as a time when solar activity all but stopped. In making the case for the anomaly, he gathered and interpreted data {{from a wide variety of}} sources, including first-hand accounts from extant historical observations of the Sun going back to the telescopic observations of Galileo and other contemporary scientists of the 17th and early 18th centuries; from historical reports of the aurora borealis observed in past centuries in Europe and the New World; from visual observations of sunspots seen with the unaided eye at sunrise and sunset in dynastic records from the Orient; from existing descriptions of the eclipsed Sun; and from measurements of carbon-14 in dated tree-rings. In the last of these, which can be used as a <b>proxy</b> <b>indicator</b> of solar activity, he found evidence of other similar periods of solar quiescence in the distant past, the most recent an even longer 90-year span, from about 1460 until 1550, which he named the Spörer Minimum. Both the Maunder and Spörer minima fell during the coldest parts of the Little Ice Age, which suggested a meaningful connection between the longer term behavior of the Sun and of the Earth’s mean surface temperature. In advancing the theory that the Sun is a variable star Eddy observed: [...] "It has long been thought that the Sun is a constant star of regular and repeatable behavior. Measurements of the radiative output, or solar constant, seem to justify the first assumption, and the record of periodicity in sunspot numbers is taken as evidence of the second. Both records, however, sample only the most recent history of the Sun." ...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{traditional}} {{tools for}} assessing surgical capacity in low-income countries requires {{significant amounts of}} time and resources, and have thus not been systematically utilized in the poorest regions of the world. <b>Proxy</b> <b>indicators</b> have been suggested as a simpler and more accessible tool {{to achieve the same}} end. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the use of <b>proxy</b> <b>indicators</b> to assess the number of operations per capita in a given region of Sub-Saharan Africa. Method: We compiled surgical data from 57 health institutions in Sierra Leone that performed surgery in 2012 to evaluate the reliability of using the percentage of caesarean sections compared to total operations performed (%CS), hernia repairs (%HR) or both(%CS&HR) as indicators of total surgical activity. In total 23 496 cases were included in the study. We performed a logistic regression analysis with %CS, %HR and %CS&HR as the dependent variable and the operations per thousand capita as the co-variant. Results: We found a strong significant correlation for each of the <b>proxy</b> <b>indicators,</b> with the estimated odds ratio for %HR being 0. 864 (p < 0, 001), the estimated odds ratio for %CS being 0. 942 (p < 0, 001) and the estimated odds ratio for %CS&HR being 0. 856 (p < 0, 001).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Earthquakes are {{the most}} violent type of natural {{disasters}} and injuries are the dominant medical problem in the early phases after earthquakes. However, likely because of poor data availability, high-quality research on injuries after earthquakes is lacking. Length of hospital stay (LOS) has been validated as a <b>proxy</b> <b>indicator</b> for injury severity in high-income settings and could potentially be used in retrospective research of injuries after earthquakes. In this study, we assessed LOS as an adequate <b>proxy</b> <b>indicator</b> for severe injury in trauma survivors of an earthquake. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted using a database of 1, 878 injured patients from the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. Our primary outcome was severe injury, defined as a composite measure of serious injury or resource use. Secondary outcomes were serious injury and resource use, analysed separately. Non-parametric receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) {{analysis was used to}} test the discriminatory accuracy of LOS when used to identify severe injury. An 0. 7 <AUC< 0. 8 was defined as adequate. RESULTS: Our study shows that LOS discriminatory accuracy is poor for the primary outcome. However, LOS discriminatory accuracy is adequate for resource use, excluding critical orthopaedic interventions and debridement. CONCLUSIONS: Length of hospital stay was not validated as a <b>proxy</b> <b>indicator</b> for severe injury in earthquake survivors. However, LOS was found to be a proxy for major nonorthopaedic surgery and blood transfusion. These findings can be useful for retrospective research on earthquake-injured patients when detailed hospital records are not available...|$|E

40|$|Much of {{the health}} {{information}} available to consumers on the Internet is incomplete, out of date, and even inaccurate. Seals of approval or trustmarks have been suggested as a strategy to assist consumers to identify high quality information. Little is known, however, about how consumers interpret such seals. This study addresses this issue by examining assumptions about the quality criteria that are reflected by a seal of approval. This question is of particular importance because {{a wide variety of}} quality criteria have been suggested for online health information, including core aspects of quality such as accuracy, currency, and completeness, <b>proxy</b> <b>indicators</b> of quality such as the disclosure of commercial interests, and indicators that reflect the quality of the site or the interaction it affords, such as the availability of a search mechanism. The {{results of this study suggest}} that seals of approval are assumed to certify information quality primarily with respect to core quality indicators, aspects that subjects both consider to be important and feel relatively less able to evaluate for themselves (compared to their ability to rate <b>proxy</b> <b>indicators</b> of information or indicators of site or interaction quality). This assumption is largely inconsistent with practice: most seals of approval involve assessment of <b>proxy</b> <b>indicators</b> of information quality, rather than direct assessment of content. These results identify a problem that certification or accreditation bodies must address, since unless and until consumer expectations are congruent with evaluation practice, seals of approval seem to promise more than they deliver...|$|R

The study population comprised 6 – 17 year old subjects belonging to three local health units of the Lombardy Region, northern Italy. Regional administrative databases were used to collect data on: the number of children with an incident hospitalization for asthma during the 2004 – 2006 period, anti-asthma therapy, specialist visit referrals, and claims for spirometry, released in the 12 months before and after hospitalization.

We used 5 existing data sets (from Burkina Faso, Mali, Mozambique, Bangladesh, and the Philippines) with repeat 24 -h recalls to construct 8 candidate food group diversity indicators (FGI) and to calculate the mean probability of adequacy (MPA) for 11 micronutrients. FGI varied in food group disaggregation and in minimum consumption required for a food group to count. There were large gaps between intakes and requirements across a range of micronutrients in each site.
