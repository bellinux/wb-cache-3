40|$|This paper investigates passive vehicle {{suspensions}} with inerters {{by considering}} multiple performance requirements including ride comfort, <b>suspension</b> <b>deflection</b> and tyre grip, where <b>suspension</b> <b>deflection</b> performance is novelly considered which is formulated {{as a part}} of objective functions and a constraint separately. Six suspension configurations are analyzed and the analytical solutions for each performance measure are derived. The conditions for each configuration to be strictly better than the simpler ones are obtained by presenting the analytical solutions of each configuration based on those of the simpler ones. Then, two stages of comparisons are given to show the performance limitations of <b>suspension</b> <b>deflection</b> for passive <b>suspensions</b> with inerters. In the first stage, it is shown that although the configurations with inerters can improve the mixed performance of ride comfort and tyre grip, the <b>suspension</b> <b>deflection</b> performance is significantly decreased simultaneously. In the second stage, it is shown that for passive suspensions with inerters, <b>suspension</b> <b>deflection</b> is the more basic limitation for both ride comfort and tyre grip performance by doing comparisons among mixed ride comfort and <b>suspension</b> <b>deflection</b> optimization, mixed ride comfort and tyre grip optimization, and mixed <b>suspension</b> <b>deflection</b> and tyre grip optimization. Finally, the problem of mixed ride comfort and tyre grip performance optimization with equal <b>suspension</b> <b>deflection</b> is investigated. The limitations of <b>suspension</b> <b>deflection</b> for each configuration are further highlighted. <br/...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the performance of a full car model active suspension system using LQR controller. Dynamic model used in this study is a linear model. A linear model can capture basic performances of vehicle suspension such as body displacement, body acceleration, wheel displacement, wheel <b>deflection,</b> <b>suspension</b> travels, pitch and yawn. Performance of suspension system is determined by the ride comfort and vehicle handling. It can be measured by car body displacement and wheel displacement performance.

40|$|Summary A stroke {{dependent}} damper {{is designed}} for the front axle suspension of a truck. The damper supplies extra damping for inward deflections rising above 4 cm. In this way the damper should reduce extreme <b>suspension</b> <b>deflections</b> without deteriorating {{the comfort of the}} truck. But the question is which stroke dependent damping curve yields the best compromise between <b>suspension</b> <b>deflection</b> working space and comfort. Therefore an optimization problem is defined to minimize the maximum inward <b>suspension</b> <b>deflection</b> subject to constraints on the chassis acceleration for three typical road undulations. The optimization problem is solved using sequential linear programming (SLP) and multibody dynamics simulation software. Several optimization runs have been carried out for a small two degree of freedom vehicle model and a large full-scale model of the truck semi-trailer combination. The results show that the stroke dependent damping can reduce large deflections at incidental road disturbances, but that the optimum stroke dependent damping curve is related to the acceleration bound. By means of vehicle model simulation and numerical optimization {{we have been able to}} quantify this trade-off between <b>suspension</b> <b>deflection</b> working space and truck comfort...|$|R

The optimization results are compared {{with two other}} configurations, one having the same complexity in construction but employing an inerter while the other being the simplest suspension network with one damper and one spring only. The motivation is to investigate the possibility and situations where the inerter can be replaced by some cheaper element such as the spring.

40|$|Abstract: To improve riding {{performance}} of the bus with air suspension, the half-car nonlinear model of air suspension was created {{with the help of}} analyzing nonlinear character of spring-pneumatic. Slow on-off control of two-state damping was proposed according to the tire deformation and <b>suspension</b> <b>deflection,</b> and the shock absorber with two-state damping was designed by opening and closing the orifice of throttle. It was difficult to obtain the tire deformation directly, and the state-observer of air suspension was proposed based on Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) algorithm, namely the tire deformation was estimated by the <b>suspension</b> <b>deflection</b> and its relative changing speed. Simulation shows EKF algorithm can estimate the running states well, and the estimating error of RMS is below 10 % in 3 seconds and the whole vehicle testing validate that the slow on-off control can enhance the capability of air suspension. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{proposes a}} systematic and effective optimization {{process for the}} design of vertical passive suspension of light rail vehicles (LRVs) using new constrained multiobjective evolution algorithms. A multibody dynamic model of the three-car train set is presented and the suspension spring and damping parameters are optimally designed. A new design of the passive suspension is aided by the use of evolution algorithms to attain the best compromise between ride quality and <b>suspension</b> <b>deflections</b> due to irregular gradient tracks. Extensive simulations are performed to verify the proposed design scheme. The preliminary results show that, when the passive suspension is optimized via the proposed approach, a substantial improvement in the vertical ride quality is obtained while keeping the <b>suspension</b> <b>deflections</b> within their allowable clearance when the light rail vehicle runs onto the worst track condition.

40|$|Optimal control schemes {{are usually}} {{employed}} to minimize different performance criteria of active suspension system {{of a vehicle}} such as, ride comfort and road safety. These factors are usually combined into a single quantity using proper weighting parameters that depend on the designerâs preferences. Generally, the selection of these weighting parameters is based on trial and error, {{which can be a}} time-consuming and computationally-intensive process. This paper proposes the use of an approach based on nested optimization loops to automate the selection process of these weighting parameters. The objective of the inner optimization loop is to minimize of the quadratic performance index associated with the original active suspension problem while the objective of the outer optimization loop is to minimize driverâs acceleration, for ride comfort, while maintaining both tire <b>deflection</b> and <b>suspension</b> <b>deflection</b> within acceptable limits. The design variables are the weighting parameters associated with the quadratic performance index used in the optimal control of active suspension. A modified form of Hooke-Jeeves algorithm is used to handle this problem while the penalty function method is used to handle the constraints.

30|$|As {{shown in}} FiguresÂ  6 and 8, the peak {{values of the}} front <b>suspension</b> <b>deflections</b> and front tire dynamic forces are reduced by the HIS under the front wheel input. For the front <b>suspension</b> <b>deflections</b> of the VHIS, the {{frequency}} response lower than the natural vibration frequency is slightly enlarged, and that higher than the natural vibration frequency is unchanged; further, the HIS system reduces the transmissibility in high frequency ranges. For the front tire dynamic forces, the proposed HIS system maintains the same transmissibility located before the oscillation frequency, but slightly increases the transmissibility higher than the natural vibration frequency, and the frequency response is reduced in higher frequency ranges. Moreover, the frequency responses of the rear <b>suspension</b> <b>deflections</b> and rear tire dynamic forces under the left wheel input for the VHIS are much larger {{than those of the}} VCS-EP. This phenomenon illustrates that a mining vehicle with the HIS system transmits a greater degree of motion to the opposite wheels under the corresponding mode vibration. As shown, the frequency responses of the VHIS exhibit much broader peak ranges than the VCS-EP owing to the interconnection mechanism. For the VHIS, the additional excitation applied to the front or rear wheels can be transmitted much more efficiently to the opposite wheel through the hydraulic system. This result is helpful to balance the dynamic forces between the front and rear wheels, thus enhancing the ground holding performance.|$|R

40|$|This project {{focuses on}} the design of sliding mode control with {{particle}} swarm optimization algorithm for a system with external disturbance. The disturbance can be matched and/or mismatched. Also the matched part can be matched to part of the control inputs. Therefore, the proposed controller is developed to be applied for any of these types of disturbance. Essentially, sliding mode control provides a control law that moves the states trajectory of the system into a prespecified sliding surface and maintains the state on this surface thereafter. The main advantage of sliding mode control is that when the system is restricted in the sliding surface its dynamic is insensitive to the external disturbance that satisfies the matching condition. If the disturbance does not satisfy the matching condition it has effect on the system during the sliding mode which may affect the stability of the system. In this project, a straight forward method for sliding surface and control law design that guarantees the reaching and sliding condition are presented. Then, sliding mode control with particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to reduce the effect of the mismatched disturbance on the system during the sliding mode. Finally, the proposed controller is applied to a quarter car suspension system. In general, there are four important aspects must be considered in suspension system control design. These aspects are body acceleration, tire <b>deflection,</b> <b>suspension</b> travel, and hydraulic actuator limit. In this project, the strategy that is used in designing the controller is to minimize the body acceleration by maintaining the other three aspects within an acceptable limit.
