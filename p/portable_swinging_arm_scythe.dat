Attached to the stationary tower is a <b>swinging</b> <b>arm</b> that moves with the push of a 64KW drive motor. Fixed to both sides of the <b>swinging</b> <b>arm</b> is an opposite propulsion conduction system via two drive shafts that run from the connection point of the stationary tower and <b>swinging</b> <b>arm,</b> to the connection point where the <b>swinging</b> <b>arm</b> attaches to the passenger gondola, which keep the passenger gondola upright.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, billet caster mold {{oscillation}} {{have been}} found that the mold have sinked and swing have became deformed in the operated process, in order to solve the problem, firstly,the billet caster mold oscillation is simulated on dynamics by using Adams; the force of every joining on <b>swinging</b> <b>arm</b> is obtained. Then, the finite element analysis is worked on <b>swinging</b> <b>arm</b> by using Solid Works COSMOS Works; the stress on everywhere is obtained. The place of maximum stress value is found, then reconstruct <b>swinging</b> <b>arm,</b> at last, the maximum stress value of <b>swinging</b> <b>arm</b> is declined and the factor of safety of <b>swinging</b> <b>arm</b> is increased. So the problem of mold sunk is solved...|$|R

50|$|Large-scale {{changes were}} made in 2001, with a {{complete}} restyling of the bodywork by designer Gareth Davies, a newly designed engine raising the horsepower to 149 with internal performance upgrades included Forged steel crankshaft, forged steel connecting rods, and forged aluminium pistons. Focussed on reducing weight and better handling, the 2001 955i used a more common double-sided <b>swing</b> <b>arm</b> (DSSA) {{as opposed to the}} single-sided <b>swing</b> <b>arm</b> (SSSA) of the previous Daytonas. The DSSA version weighs 7.5 lb less than the SSSA due to the lighter weight <b>swing</b> <b>arm,</b> and it is argued that the DSSA version handles better than the SSSA as it has less flex in the <b>swing</b> <b>arm.</b> The 2001+ 955i version had a more compact and advanced Sagem MC1000 electronic engine management system (2-plug) instead of the original Sagem MC2000 controller (1-plug).|$|R

50|$|The mount/demount {{mechanism}} {{consists of}} the duckhead, <b>swing</b> <b>arm,</b> and vertical slide. The duckhead {{is at the bottom}} end of the vertical slide. The duckhead is uniquely shaped, like a tapered bill, to fit next and surround the rim of a wheel. It can either be made of metal or plastic. The duckhead mounts and demounts the tire from the wheel. The <b>swing</b> <b>arm</b> moves left and right. The purpose of the <b>swing</b> <b>arm</b> is to move the duck head near or away from the rim. The last component of the mount/demount mechanism is the vertical slide. The vertical slide moves up and down so that the duck head can fit onto the rims of different size wheel widths. The vertical slide has a spring and locking handle above the <b>swing</b> <b>arm</b> to set the duckhead and maintain a stable position around the rim.|$|R

50|$|<b>Arm</b> <b>swing</b> {{in human}} bipedal walking {{is a natural}} motion that each <b>arm</b> <b>swings</b> with {{the motion of the}} {{opposing}} leg. <b>Swinging</b> <b>arms</b> in an opposing direction with respect to the lower limb reduces the angular momentum of the body, balancing the rotational motion produced during walking. Although such pendulum-like motion of arms is not essential for walking, recent studies point that <b>arm</b> <b>swing</b> improves the stability and energy efficiency in human locomotion. Those positive effects of <b>arm</b> <b>swing</b> have been utilized in sports, especially in racewalking and sprinting.|$|R
40|$|Humans walk bipedally, and thus, it {{is unclear}} why they <b>swing</b> their <b>arms.</b> In this paper, we will review the {{mechanisms}} and functions of <b>arm</b> <b>swinging</b> in human gait. First, we discuss the potential advantages of having <b>swinging</b> <b>arms.</b> Second, {{we go into the}} detail on the debate whether <b>arm</b> <b>swing</b> is arising actively or passively, where we will conclude that while a large part of <b>arm</b> <b>swinging</b> is mechanically passive, there is an active contribution of muscles (i. e. an activity that is not merely caused by stretch reflexes). Third, we describe the possible function of the active muscular contribution to <b>arm</b> <b>swinging</b> in normal gait, and discuss the possibility that a Central Pattern Generator (CPG) generates this activity. Fourth, we discuss examples from pathological cases, in which <b>arm</b> <b>swinging</b> is affected. Moreover, using the ideas presented, we suggest ways in which <b>arm</b> <b>swing</b> may be used as a therapeutic aid. We conclude that (1) <b>arm</b> <b>swing</b> should be seen {{as an integral part of}} human bipedal gait, arising mostly from passive movements, which are stabilized by active muscle control, which mostly originates from locomotor circuits in the central nervous system (2) <b>arm</b> <b>swinging</b> during normal bipedal gait most likely serves to reduce energy expenditure and (3) <b>arm</b> <b>swinging</b> may be of therapeutic value...|$|R
