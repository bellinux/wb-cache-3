2500|$|About [...] {{from the}} tunnel's Western Portal {{there is an}} {{underground}} wharf about [...] long with the tunnel here widened to about [...] One of the horizontal tunnels departing from the tunnel at this point used {{to run to the}} Butterley Company's Butterley Carr Pit which opened in 1812 and loaded its coal directly into narrow boats at the underground wharf. There were also vertical shafts from the wharf which allowed goods in tram boxes to be lowered directly from and lifted up to the Butterley Company's works (on the hill above the tunnel) to and from the underground wharf. These tram boxes were used by Benjamin Outram on the Little Eaton Tramway. The box could be lifted from the tram chassis and loaded directly into narrow boats or barges on the Derby Canal. Similar designs were used in other undertakings in which Benjamin Outram had an interest. Initially the boxes were lowered {{with the aid of a}} large water bucket descending or ascending a <b>parallel</b> <b>shaft</b> to act as a counterbalance. This system was later replaced by a steam engine winding the boxes up and down the shafts. Reputable sources cited here consider the presence and mode of use of this underground wharf to be if not unique, extremely rare within the United Kingdom.|$|E

50|$|In a two pulley system, {{the belt}} can either drive the pulleys {{normally}} {{in one direction}} (the same if on <b>parallel</b> <b>shafts),</b> or the belt may be crossed, so that {{the direction of the}} driven shaft is reversed (the opposite direction to the driver if on <b>parallel</b> <b>shafts).</b> As a source of motion, a conveyor belt is one application where the belt is adapted to carry a load continuously between two points.|$|R
50|$|The open {{belt drive}} has <b>parallel</b> <b>shafts</b> {{rotating}} {{in the same}} direction, whereas the cross-belt drive also bears <b>parallel</b> <b>shafts</b> but rotate in opposite direction. The former is far more common, and the latter not appropriate for timing and standard V-belts {{unless there is a}} twist between each pulley so that the pulleys only contact the same belt surface. Nonparallel shafts can be connected if the belt's center line is aligned with the center plane of the pulley. Industrial belts are usually reinforced rubber but sometimes leather types, non-leather non-reinforced belts, can only be used in light applications.|$|R

It is found that there is significant qualitative influence of the motor constants on the system behaviour. At the resonance, there are two periodic attractors for the same value of the control parameter. Two catastrophic bifurcations are associated with each resonance.

50|$|A {{screw pump}} {{is a more}} {{complicated}} type of rotary pump that uses two or three screws with opposing thread — e.g., one screw turns clockwise and the other counterclockwise. The screws are mounted on <b>parallel</b> <b>shafts</b> that have gears that mesh so the shafts turn together and everything stays in place. The screws turn on the shafts and drive fluid through the pump. As with other forms of rotary pumps, the clearance between moving parts and the pump's casing is minimal.|$|R

50|$|RJR's {{dominant}} {{feature is the}} 152 m Storstupet ("Big Shaft"). All of the water falls down a <b>parallel</b> <b>shaft</b> only a few metres away. The Ulvgangen ("Wolf Walk") traverses across the cascades {{at the mouth of}} this wet shaft to the dry Storstupet. A pulldown descent of Storstupet is complicated by its low angle (about 80 degrees), and many teams prefer to detackle this pitch from above. Halfway down Storstupet is a window connecting back with the wet shaft, so descending cavers can enjoy all of the sound and fury of the wet shaft in relative comfort. All of the water from the <b>parallel</b> <b>shaft</b> sinks into the floor at its bottom, and is not seen again in the cave.|$|E

5000|$|Spur gears or straight-cut gears are the {{simplest}} type of gear. They {{consist of a}} cylinder or disk with teeth projecting radially. Though the teeth are not straight-sided (but usually of special form to achieve a constant drive ratio, mainly involute but less commonly cycloidal), the edge of each tooth is straight and aligned parallel to the axis of rotation. These gears mesh together correctly only if fitted to <b>parallel</b> <b>shafts.</b> [...] No axial thrust is created by the tooth loads. Spur gears are excellent at moderate speeds but tend to be noisy at high speeds.|$|R
50|$|Hamites {{species are}} characterised by a shell {{that began with}} an open, {{sometimes}} helical, regular spiral that either opened into a single large hook http://homepage.mac.com/nmonks/Projects/ammonitereconstr.html, or else formed three <b>parallel</b> <b>shafts</b> that gave the mature shell the approximate appearance of a paper clip http://homepage.mac.com/nmonks/Projects/ammonitereconstr.html. No Hamites had spines or other such ornamentation on the shell, but several species appear to have developed apertural modifications when mature; that is, once the ammonite had grown to its final size, the aperture became constricted and was bounded by one or two thickened ribs, known as collars. These have been observed on other ammonites as well, and {{are assumed to be}} signs of sexual dimorphism.|$|R

50|$|At about 19:00 on that day, Alfredo {{fell into}} an {{artesian}} well {{which was very}} narrow and deep (about 30 centimeters wide and 80 meters deep). His position, on arrival of the first rescuers, was estimated at around 36 meters below ground level. To reach him, a <b>parallel</b> <b>shaft</b> was constructed beside the well. Unfortunately, the drilling caused him to slip an estimated 30 meters farther down the well.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} a {{longitudinally}} mounted flat twin four-stroke engine with overhead valves. The compressor was located between {{the seat and}} gearbox {{and in the first}} version was driven by an additional open <b>parallel</b> <b>shaft</b> next to the magneto with a right-angle bevel gear linkage. Thus, the compressor shaft ran transversely to the direction of travel. The boost pressure was up to 2 bar depending on application.

5000|$|Floyd Collins from Sand Cave in Kentucky in 1925. Likely {{the first}} high profile cave rescue in history. Collins' desperate {{situation}} {{in the depths of}} Sand Cave made headlines across America. Over 10,000 spectators flocked to Sand Cave in the week following the news of Floyd's predicament. The National Guard was called in to control the carnival-like atmosphere surrounding the cave. Despite the heroic efforts of volunteers who attempted to dig a <b>parallel</b> <b>shaft</b> to free Collins, he was found dead, buried to his shoulders in debris. One 25-pound rock had jammed Collin's foot, preventing his escape. Collins remained trapped in Sand Cave for another 2 months until a crew of German engineers finished the digging of the shaft and extracted his body.|$|E
40|$|A three-point hitch, mounted {{implement}} {{was developed}} to control the injection rate of trickle irrigation tubing. Power to the implement was supplied by the tractor's electric and hydraulic systems. A doppler radar velocity sensor measured ground speed and provided a signal to a single board computer. The computer generated an output signal which operated a throttling valve that controlled the hydraulic flow to the motor coupled {{to one of two}} pulling wheels. The wheels, mounted on <b>parallel</b> <b>shafts</b> with their faces in contact, utilized friction to feed the tubing. An error feedback loop controlled the pulling wheels speed with satisfactory operation being obtained over a range of travel speeds of 3. 7 km/h to 5. 6 km/h. Extra tube dispensing and cutting systems were incorporated in the design. These were manually activated by the operator when required...|$|R
50|$|Roll forming is, {{among the}} {{manufacturing}} processes, {{one of the}} simplest. It typically begins with a large coil of sheet metal, between 1 inch cm and 20 inch cm. in width, and 0.004 inch mm and 0.125 inch mm thick, supported on an uncoiler. The strip is fed through an entry guide to properly align the material as it passes through the rolls of the mill, each set of rolls forming a bend until the material reaches its desired shape. Roll sets are typically mounted {{one over the other}} on a pair of horizontal <b>parallel</b> <b>shafts</b> supported by a stand(s). Side rolls and cluster rolls may also be used to provide greater precision and flexibility and to limit stresses on the material. The shaped strips can be cut to length ahead of a roll forming mill, between mills, or {{at the end of the}} roll forming line.|$|R
50|$|A Sumera is a {{bottomless}} pit, {{and locals}} initially treated Noon's Hole as a supernatural area, viewing it with suspicion and fear. However, in August 1895, the French cave explorer Édouard-Alfred Martel explored the cave {{for the first}} time, descending to 20 m. It was not until 1912 that {{a group called the}} Yorkshire Ramblers reached the bottom. Not discouraged by their equipment not having arrived from England, they made the descent of the complex 78 m shaft using a 35 m long rope ladder built from materials purchased from Fermanagh ships chandlers and timber merchants, hauling it up and down from the surface when the explorers found ledges to stand on. All they found at the bottom was a short passage leading to a sump. During the Easter of 1970, a group from the University of Leeds Speleological Association investigated the <b>parallel</b> <b>shafts,</b> and found that one led into 400 m of passages they named the After-Noon Series.|$|R
50|$|Professor McKenny Hughes {{reported}} that the entrance was blocked with glacial fill until a flood in 1872, when it got washed out. He wriggled round the large boulder and reached the shaft which he estimated as being in excess of 90 m deep. In 1895 Edward Calvert, of the Yorkshire Ramblers' Club, attempted to replicate Edouard Martel's descent of the Main Shaft of a few weeks earlier, but failed to get beyond Birkbeck's Ledge at -60 m because of the quantity of water. Looking up, {{he could see that}} the shaft divided behind a curtain. Later in the year he entered Jib Tunnel, and realised that this was the <b>parallel</b> <b>shaft</b> that he had seen, and that a man could be lowered directly {{to the floor of the}} Main Chamber from its lip. The following year, he set up a series of jibs and pulleys, and was lowered in a boatswain's chair, becoming the second person to reach the Main Chamber. Jib Tunnel was used for explorations of the system until 1921, when the current system of lowering the winch from a gantry positioned across the corner of the Main Shaft was developed.|$|E

40|$|Most {{turbines}} in {{the market}} today follow a modular configuration comprised of a main shaft, gearbox, high speed shaft, and generator. The gearbox has the important task of increasing the slow rotor speeds to meet the electromechanical requirements of the electromechanical. These gearboxes are commonly composed of a planetary stage and several <b>parallel</b> <b>shaft</b> stages. The planetary, or epicyclical, design of the gearbox is {{a feature of the}} design that has many advantages compared to the traditional <b>parallel</b> <b>shaft</b> arrangement. Among these are that higher gear ratios can be achieved in a single stage, they are capable to carrying higher loads, and they require less space than the traditional <b>parallel</b> <b>shaft</b> arrangement. For this reason, planetary gearboxes they are commonly used in the first stage of the wind turbine gearboxes. However, planetary stages are more complex than the typical <b>parallel</b> <b>shaft</b> arrangement, and can be affected by deflection in the planet carrier, annulus deformations and bearing clearances. Unanticipated levels of these motions can reduce their life expectancy. This paper gives a brief overview of a subset of the experimental efforts, data, and analysis of the GRC project focusing on the planet carrier deformation...|$|E
50|$|The F23 has two gearsets on each {{of three}} <b>parallel</b> <b>shafts</b> - the input shaft, the output shaft, and the {{intermediate}} shaft. This three-shaft (also called three-axis) design results {{in a very short}} axial length for better packaging. There are three separate shift fork shafts, which hold three shift forks to activate the synchronizer rings for the two gearsets {{on each of}} the three gear shafts. The shift forks are activated by a cable system. The clutch release bearing is operated by a concentric slave cylinder that surrounds the input shaft in the clutch housing. A concentric slave cylinder allows more linear clutch feel than an external lever-actuated clutch and release bearing. The input shaft carries the 3rd and 4th gear synchronizer, the intermediate shaft carries the 1st and 2nd gear synchronizer, and the output shaft carries the 5th and reverse gear synchronizer. The aluminium case contains a conventional final drive gearset.|$|R

Modern level advanced carbon composite materials have opened a new level of soundless, high resilience, lubricant free and precision gearing in power and motion transmission. A proper understanding and prediction of gear failure is an important pre-requisite for any reliable application. In this project, a spur gear is designed using advanced modelling software (Solidworks) and is meshed and analyzed using analysis software by the application of torque load. Finally, by comparing the analysis result of both composite spur gear and the existing cast steel spur gear...|$|R
50|$|From {{the outset}} the largest problem was {{torsional}} vibration of the crankshaft, {{at one time}} necessitating a ban on using below 4000rpm on the bench. The vibration often caused one or other of the cranks to shear itself off the central spur gear, resulting in the engine becoming two aphasic flat-8s, or the <b>parallel</b> quill <b>shaft</b> (driven at 0.8 times the crank speed, located below crank, and in turn driving the flywheel and ancillaries) overheated and disintegrated.|$|R

40|$|A {{generalized}} {{life and}} reliability model is presented for <b>parallel</b> <b>shaft</b> geared prop-fan and turboprop aircraft transmissions. The transmission life and reliability {{model is a}} combination of the individual reliability models for all the bearings and gears in the main load paths. The bearing and gear reliability models are based on classical fatigue theory and the two parameter Weibull failure distribution. A computer program was developed to calculate the transmission life and reliability. The program is modular. In its present form, the program can analyze five different transmission arrangements. However, the program can be modified easily to include additional transmission arrangements. An example is included which compares the life of a compound two-stage transmission with the life of a split-torque, parallel compound two-stage transmission as calculated by the comaputer program...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: To {{enhance the}} {{mobility}} of combat tracked vehicles, a high-powered compact power pack is crucial. To achieve this goal, it is planned to apply the concept of high-contact-ratio (HCR) gearing to an independent final-drive planetary gear assembly of the tracked vehicle transmission. Before applying the concept to the final-drive, the performances of both normal-contact-ratio (NCR) and HCR conventional <b>parallel</b> <b>shaft</b> spur gearing systems are evaluated and compared. The results show that, for the same torque, HCR gears are subjected to lower loads and endure almost double the life of NCR gears. This reveals that an HCR gear can transmit more power for the same size. Furthermore, the power loss, vibration, and noise level of the HCR gearing are significantly {{lower than those of}} the NCR gearing. The proven results of the case study have encouraged the replacement of the existing NCR gearing with the HCR gearing for the final-drive planetary assembly of the combat tracked vehicle for evaluation...|$|E

This shared many similar design features with the Dingo, notably the H form drive train in which a central differential eliminates loss of traction due to wheel-slip, and <b>parallel</b> drive <b>shafts</b> considerably reduced the height of the vehicle (roughly equivalent to that of a tracked AFV), considerably reducing the vehicle's visual signature over conventional armoured car designs.|$|R
40|$|A conical {{involute}} gear, which resembles {{in shape}} a spur gear-shaper cutter, {{is generated by}} feeding the cutter along any element of the cone. There {{is no question about}} the way of generating a gear with a rack cutter or a spur gear-shaper cutter. 　Now speaking of generating a conical gear, the way of using a hob is practically much commoner and easier than that of using a rack cutter or a gear-shaper cutter. Cutting the gear with a hob comes to the same result with cutting it with a rack cutter set obliquely to the pitch circle of the gear, as the hob is shaped into a screw-like form. Asymmetric teeth are obtained by feeding a rack cutter set obliquely to the pitch circle of the gear along any element of the cone. 　We show in detail the process of generating a conical gear with a hob and the difference between both the normal pitches of {{the right and the left}} profiles of a gear tooth. If the conical gears are mounted on the two <b>parallel</b> <b>shafts,</b> they rotate smoothly, but if they are mounted on the two intersecting shafts in place of the bevel gears, their mesh is not conjugate theoretically...|$|R
