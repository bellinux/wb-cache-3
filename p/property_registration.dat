40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The {{objective}} of this thesis is to make recommendations for a residential property tax mechanism {{for the city of}} Wenzhou, China. The research question is " Given what can be learned from the U. S. system, how can we improve the property tax system in China to be more complete and how can the Shanghai and Chongqing pilots be made current to be more appropriate for Wenzhou?" To conduct the research, {{the first step is to}} investigate the Chinese property tax system. Then, it examines the U. S. property tax system, including an analysis of the legal background, land ownership, and process of taxation. In addition to the U. S. property tax model for insights, recommendations for Wenzhou also draw on the current Shanghai and Chongqing pilots, which are studied as part of this thesis. The recommendations are: combine ad valorem tax and specific tax; decentralize and leave autonomy for local government; address land-transferring fees issues; establish a personal <b>properties</b> <b>registration</b> system and <b>properties</b> assessment system; tax taxpayers in same circumstances alike; implement general homestead exemption and other more comprehensive abatement; create appeal process; address use of tax...|$|R

40|$|The Title Deeds and <b>Properties</b> <b>Registration</b> Organization (ITDPRO) in Iran was {{established}} in the early 1940 s and Cadastral Organization in Iran {{was established}} 2 decades ago. All ownership deeds of the country are issued in a traditional textual form, and in this description, there is no direct mention of the coordinates indicating the corners of the land, nor is there a map attached. The result is {{that it is difficult to}} find the location of parcels of land which is causing many claims and disputes related to the real estate. In other words, the management of land and property in Iran is currently costing a lot of time and effort. In addition to that, there is an insufficient number of staff to deal with the problems arising from this situation. The ITDPRO is managed in a traditional way, whereby experts of the ITDPRO are relying on traditional technologies. In contrast, the Cadastral Organization of the country is utilizing modernized technology and young specialists in the field of surveying, geodesy, GIS, and Computer Engineering, who were assigned to reform and reorganize the present situation of properties of the country. This duality is resulting in disagreement on the concepts used among ITDPRO and the Cadastral Organization. The main factors o...|$|R
