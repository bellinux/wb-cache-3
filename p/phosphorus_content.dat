5|$|Geologists have {{classified}} the volcano's {{lava flows}} into two units. The Hawi Volcanic layers were {{deposited in the}} shield stage of the volcano's life, and the younger Pololu Volcanics were deposited in the volcano's post-shield stage. The rock in the younger Hawi section, which overlies the older Pololu flows, is mostly 260,000 to 140,000 years old, and composed mainly of hawaiite and trachyte. The separation between the two layers is not clear; the lowest layers may actually be in the Pololu section, based on their depositional patterns and low <b>phosphorus</b> <b>content.</b> The time intervals separating the two periods of volcanic evolution were extremely brief, something first noted in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{not widely}} cultivated, Alloxylon flammeum {{has proven to be}} by far the most hardy and {{adaptable}} (as well as the showiest) member of the genus Alloxylon, and has been grown successfully in as cool a climate as Victoria. It does best in a well-drained soil rich in organic material but low in phosphorus with some shelter when young. Applying mulch to the soil around the plant and extra water in dry spells is beneficial. Fertilisers high in <b>phosphorus</b> <b>content</b> can damage the plant, though fertilisers specifically for Australian native plants can be used. Yellowing of new leaves may indicate chlorosis from iron deficiency and can be remedied with iron chelate or iron sulphate. Its flowers attract birds to gardens. A large tree grows in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney. It is thought that there are more plants in cultivation than there are in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Each year, some East African {{populations of}} blue {{wildebeest}} have a long-distance migration, seemingly timed {{to coincide with}} the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth. The timing of their migrations in both the rainy and dry seasons can vary considerably (by months) from year to year. At the end of the wet season (May or June in East Africa), wildebeest migrate to dry-season areas in response to a lack of surface (drinking) water. When the rainy season begins again (months later), animals quickly move back to their wet-season ranges. Factors suspected to affect migration include food abundance, surface water availability, predators, and <b>phosphorus</b> <b>content</b> in grasses. Phosphorus is a crucial element for all life forms, particularly for lactating female bovids. As a result, during the rainy season, wildebeest select grazing areas that contain particularly high phosphorus levels. One study found, in addition to phosphorus, wildebeest select ranges containing grass with relatively high nitrogen content.|$|E

25|$|There are {{benefits}} of using recycled water for irrigation, including the lower cost compared {{to some other}} sources and consistency of supply regardless of season, climatic conditions and associated water restrictions.

25|$|On March 27, 2006, Governor Christine Gregoire {{signed into}} law the {{recently}} approved House Bill 2322.

40|$|The {{nutritional}} value of zooplankton (lipid and <b>phosphorus</b> <b>contents)</b> was analyzed in outdoor, plankton-culture tanks, {{to monitor the}} effects of diurnal variation and fertilization. Total lipid contents were significantly higher (average values of about 14 % DW) for the treatment fertilized during the sampling week. A significantly highher total lipid concentrations generally coincided with high biomass of Moina sp.

The values tended to be higher during the afternoon and the night. <b>Phosphorus</b> <b>contents</b> in the zooplanktonic population varied from 0. 15 to 0. 91 % DW, with significant differences among the tanks.

At the University of Aberdeen, one of MacLeod's principal teachers was the young Professor John Alexander MacWilliam. He obtained a PhD in medicine in 1898 and then spent a year studying biochemistry at the University of Leipzig, Germany, on a travelling scholarship. After returning to Britain, he became a demonstrator at the London Hospital Medical School, where in 1902 he was appointed lecturer in biochemistry. In the same year, he was awarded a doctorate in public health from Cambridge University. Around that time he published his first research article, a paper on <b>phosphorus</b> <b>content</b> in muscles.|$|E
500|$|The most {{economically}} {{important aspect}} of the geology of the area is the Northampton Sands ironstone formation. This is a marine sand of Jurassic age (Bajocian stage), deposited as part of an estuary sequence and overlain by a sequence of limestones and mudrocks. Significant amounts of the sand have been replaced or displaced by iron minerals giving an average ore grade of around 25 wt% iron. To the west the iron ores have been moderately exploited for a very long time, but their high <b>phosphorus</b> <b>content</b> made them difficult to smelt and produced iron of poor quality until the development of the Bessemer steel making process and the [...] "basic slag" [...] smelting chemistry, which combine to make high quality steelmaking possible from these unprepossessing ores. The Northampton Sands were a strategic resource for the United Kingdom in the run-up to World War II, being the best developed bulk iron producing processes wholly free from dependence on imported materials. However, because the Northampton Sands share in the regional dip of all the sediments of this part of Britain to the east-south-east, they become increasingly difficult to work as one progresses east across the county.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{alteration}} of kidney function with increase kidney calcium, magnesium and <b>phosphorus</b> <b>contents</b> in rats fed a high-phosphorus diet. Five-week-old male SD rats were used. The rats were fed a diet {{with either a}} control (0. 3 %) or a high (1. 5 %) level of phosphorus for 20 days.

Calcium, magnesium and <b>phosphorus</b> <b>contents</b> of nucleus fraction, mitochondrial fraction, microsomal fraction and cytosol of kidney were determined.

2500|$|An average adult human {{contains}} about 0.7kg of phosphorus, about 85–90% in bones and {{teeth in the}} form of apatite, and the remainder in soft tissues and extracellular fluids (~1%).

40|$|Summary: The {{effects of}} Ambilhar (niridazole or nitrothiazole) on the calcium, {{magnesium}} and <b>phosphorus</b> <b>contents</b> of various tissues of rabbits were studied. It {{results in a}} decrease in the calcium content of bones, liver and muscles. A similar depletion of the magnesium content of brain, blood, liver and muscles was observed. On the other hand, the urinary excretion of calcium and magnesium was increased. These facts indicate that the drug possibly chelates with these divalent cations. This is supported by the ultra violet spectra of the complexes prepared in vitro. The effect of Ambilhar on tissue phosphorus seems to be indirect. The <b>phosphorus</b> <b>contents</b> of both blood and urine are decreased. This could be due to an increased calcium concentration.

50|$|Phosphorus is not {{necessarily}} detrimental to iron. Ancient Indian smiths did not add lime to their furnaces. The absence of calcium oxide in the slag, and the deliberate use of wood with high <b>phosphorus</b> <b>content</b> during the smelting, induces a higher <b>phosphorus</b> <b>content</b> (less than 0.1%, average 0.25%) than in modern iron. Analysis of the Iron Pillar of Delhi gives 0.10% in the slags for 0.18% in the iron itself, for a total <b>phosphorus</b> <b>content</b> of 0.28% in the metal, accounting for much of its corrosion resistance.
