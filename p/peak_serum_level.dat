50|$|Lorazepam serum {{levels are}} {{proportional}} to the dose administered. Giving 2 mg oral lorazepam {{will result in a}} peak total serum level of around 20 ng/ml around two hours later, half of which is lorazepam, half its inactive metabolite, lorazepam-glucuronide. A similar lorazepam dose given intravenously will result in an earlier and higher <b>peak</b> <b>serum</b> <b>level,</b> with a higher relative proportion of unmetabolised (active) lorazepam. On regular administration, maximum serum levels are attained after three days. Longer-term use, up to six months, does not result in further accumulation. On discontinuation, lorazepam serum levels become negligible after three days and undetectable after about a week. Lorazepam is metabolised in the liver by conjugation into inactive lorazepam-glucuronide. This metabolism does not involve hepatic oxidation, so is relatively unaffected by reduced liver function. Lorazepam-glucuronide is more water-soluble than its precursor, so gets more widely distributed in the body, leading to a longer half-life than lorazepam. Lorazepam-glucuronide is eventually excreted by the kidneys, and, because of its tissue accumulation, it remains detectable, particularly in the urine, for substantially longer than lorazepam.|$|E

Male New Zealand white rabbits were given 120 ml of sterile saline intraperitoneally, and peritonitis developed over the following 8 h, with exudate fluid containing a mean of 17, 188 granulocytes per mm 3 at 8 h. Each antibiotic was administered intramuscularly at a dose of 30 mg/kg 3 h after peritonitis was initiated, and serum and peritoneal concentrations were measured 0. 5, 1, 2, and 4 h later. Cefamandole gave the highest mean <b>peak</b> <b>serum</b> <b>level</b> (26. 8 μg/ml), and cephalothin, cephacetrile, and cephradine all gave peak serum levels between 13 and 15 μg/ml.

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of tobramycin and clindamycin {{were examined}} in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis for chronic renal failure. <b>Peak</b> <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of tobramycin in functionally anephric patients were less than expected, probably secondary to a larger volume of distribution. Peritoneal dialysis resulted in a significant clearance of tobramycin, with a resultant reduction in serum half-life. The present data suggest that, if bactericidal <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of tobramycin are to be maintained in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, a parenteral loading dose be administered, followed by either (i) an identical dose every third half-life or (ii) one-half the loading dose every half-life.

The extent of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to fluoroquinolones {{depends on the}} mutation in the DNA gyrase, the only target of fluoroquinolones. The MIC of moxifloxacin, the most active fluoroquinolone against M. tuberculosis, may be lower than its <b>peak</b> <b>serum</b> <b>level</b> for some ofloxacin-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

We infected Swiss mice with either wild-type H 37 Rv or one of three mutant strains with different MICs that are commonly seen in clinical practice. The MICs of the mutant strains ranged from below to above the peak moxifloxacin level seen in humans (3 g/ml). Each mouse was treated with one of four moxifloxacin doses for 1 month.

40|$|Forty {{critically}} ill surgical patients with documented infections were studied during their stay in an intensive care unit. Among these patients, 19 developed septic shock and 16 died, 9 {{of them from}} septic shock. Interleukin 1 beta (IL- 1 beta), tumor necrosis factor (TNF alpha), and interleukin 6 (IL- 6) were measured each day and every 1 or 2 hours when septic shock occurred. Although IL- 1 beta was never found, TNF alpha was most often observed in the serum at a level under 100 pg/mL except during septic shock. During these acute episodes TNF alpha level reached several hundred pg/mL, {{but only for a}} few hours. In contrast, IL- 6 was always increased in the serum of acutely ill patients (peak to 500, 000 pg/mL). There was a direct correlation between IL- 6 <b>peak</b> <b>serum</b> <b>level</b> and TNF alpha <b>peak</b> <b>serum</b> <b>level</b> during septic shock and between IL- 6 serum level and temperature or C-reactive protein serum level.

40|$|Miloxacin, a {{synthetic}} antibacterial agent structurally related to oxolinic acid, has {{a broad spectrum}} of activity in vitro against gram-negative bacteria and considerable activity in vivo against infections with these bacteria. These observations led to studies on the absorption and excretion of miloxacin in mice, rats, and dogs after administration of a single oral dose. Studies on oxolinic acid have been included for comparison. <b>Peak</b> <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of miloxacin, attained 1 h after administration of 20, 50, and 100 mg/kg to rats and dogs, were approximately 20, 40, and 60 micrograms/ml, respectively. Peak levels in mice receiving the same dose were 15, 60, and 80 micrograms/ml at 0. 5 h. <b>Peak</b> <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of oxolinic acid were attained 0. 5 to 1 h later than the above times at comparable doses and were one-half to one-fourth those of miloxacin. Urinary recovery of miloxacin at the above doses ranged from 3. 2 to 6. 5 % during the 24 -h posttreatment period. Recoveries of oxolinic acid were one-half to one-fifth those of miloxacin. At a 50 -mg/kg dose, rats excreted 4. 6 % of the miloxacin in bile in the 20 -h posttreatment period...|$|R
40|$|Minimal {{concentrations}} of aminoglycoside that {{could produce a}} synergistic effect with penicillin were investigated in broth cultures containing 10 (8) enterococci per ml, in vitro in vegetations infected with ca. 10 (8) enterococci per g, and in vivo in an experimental model of enterococcal endocarditis. Penicillin G plus gentamicin (1. 5 or 0. 75 microgram/ml) sterilized a broth culture of a streptomycin-resistant strain (E 1) at 48 h. In contrast, penicillin G plus gentamicin (1. 5 or 0. 75 microgram/ml) sterilized only 2 of 15 in vitro vegetations at 5 days. Similarly, doses of gentamicin that resulted in <b>peak</b> <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of 1. 5 microgram/ml failed after 10 days of therapy with penicillin G plus gentamicin to sterilize in vivo vegetations infected with E 1, and doses of gentamicin that resulted in <b>peak</b> <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of about 8 micrograms/ml sterilized four of six vegetations. Similar results were obtained with a streptomycin-susceptible strain. These studies indicated {{that the rate of}} bactericidal activity in broth cultures is greater than the bacteriological response in infected vegetations and that aminoglycoside concentrations that appear efficacious on the basis of synergy studies in broth cultures may not be satisfactory clinically...|$|R
