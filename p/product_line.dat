5|$|One of Smith's {{significant}} contributions to the menu was {{the addition of a}} breakfast <b>product</b> <b>line</b> as part of the 1978 <b>product</b> <b>line</b> expansion. Up until that point, breakfast was not a market Burger King had served. Other than the addition of the Croissan'Wich in 1983, the breakfast menu remained almost identical to the McDonald's offerings until a menu revamp in 1986. This expansion introduced BK's A.M. Express <b>product</b> <b>line,</b> which included French toast sticks and mini-muffins. The new breakfast line was designed to be portable, because studies had shown that an increasing percent of consumers were eating breakfast on the go. Shortly after the introduction of the French toast stick products, BK partnered with Lender's Bagels to introduce a bagel breakfast sandwich. The new product was designed to drive sales in the morning by piquing customer's curiosity with a new taste. The product was tested for several months in BK's original home territory of Miami before a national roll-out.|$|E

5|$|The Burger King Specialty Sandwiches are {{a line of}} {{sandwiches}} {{developed by}} the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King in 1978 and introduced in 1979 {{as part of a}} new <b>product</b> <b>line</b> designed to expand Burger King's menu with more sophisticated, adult oriented fare beyond hamburgers. Additionally, the new line was intended to differentiate the company from other fast food hamburger restaurants at the time. Since the line's introduction, the other sandwiches have been discontinued, leaving the chicken offering, the Original Chicken Sandwich (abbreviated as OCS), as the primary product left. Additionally, other sandwiches that utilize the same roll as the chicken sandwich have been introduced to the company's menu both domestically and internationally since the original <b>product</b> <b>line</b> was introduced.|$|E
