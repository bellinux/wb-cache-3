50|$|Separating, sorting, and jig {{technology}} {{continued to}} {{advance in the}} 20th century. The first compressed air sorter for fine coal (pea and smaller) was installed in the U.S. in 1916. Major innovations in the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cleaning</b> of coal were made in 1924, 1932, and 1941. In 1935, the first dense-media separator was introduced. In these wet separators, a very dense medium (such as magnetite) is introduced into an agitated mixture of coal and water. The dense media drops {{to the bottom of}} the tank, sending water and the lighter material (such as coal) over the top for collection and drying. The first coal processing plant to utilize dense-medium separation widely was established by Dutch State Mines in 1945, and by 1950 the technology was in wide use in the U.S.|$|E
40|$|Resumo: No Brasil, a agroindústria canavieira processa 318 milhões de toneladas de cana-de-açúcar por ano (UNICA, 2003). Atualmente, de 5 a 15 % desta matéria-prima é perdida no campo, quando o corte é feito manual ou mecanizado respectivamente, representando um prejuízo da ordem de US$ 450 milhões por ano. Devido a lei governamental n° 11. 241 de 19 / 09 / 2002, o corte tende a tornar-se apenas de cana crua, sem queimar, inviabilizando o corte manual. Desta forma, as perdas devem permanecer próximas do último valor. Este trabalho parte da hipótese de que é possível desenvolver alternativas tecnológicas, como o aprimoramento dos componentes e sistemas das colhedoras de cana-de-açúcar picada, para minimizar este desperdício. Pretendeu-se, inicialmente, quantificar as perdas impossíveis de serem levantadas diretamente no campo (perdas invisíveis), já que as perdas visíveis são conhecidas, e a incidência de matéria estranha na cana processada pelas colhedoras de cana picada. Mantendo-se as colhedoras sob condições controladas, os ensaios foram realizados em um galpão de manutenção de máquinas da Usina São João/Araras-SP e na oficina de protótipos agrícolas do Centro de Tecnologia da Copersucar-CTC, de janeiro/ 1997 a março/ 2000. As colhedoras, que permaneceram estacionárias, foram alimentadas por uma esteira rolante acionada pelo motor hidráulico. Nos ensaios de perdas invisíveis foram utilizadas, inicialmente, canas limpas, desfolhadas e despontadas e depois canas com folhas e pontas. Para a determinação das impurezas vegetais na carga, foram processados colmos integrais, com folhas e ponteiros, simulando a condição adversa de canavial tombado. Por meio da análise dos dados quantificados nos ensaios de cana com palha, concluiu-se que as perdas invisíveis nos sistemas das colhedoras variaram de 2 a 11 %, e são maiores na cana com maior teor de fibra e mais torta e na cana com palha em relação à cana sem palha. A eficiência de limpeza da matéria-prima ficou entre 74 % na base matéria seca, para a velocidade angular de rotação das pás do extrator primário de 1000 rpm e 89 % para a velocidade de 1200 rpm. Os resultados apontaram que o fluxo de massa de cana que alimenta a colhedora não tem influência nas {{magnitudes}} das perdas invisíveis totais de cana e na eficiência de limpeza na matéria-prima. Baseado nos resultados obtidos na primeira fase, na segunda etapa apresentou-se 4 propostas para a regulagem, ajustes e o aperfeiçoamento dos componentes das colhedoras. A primeira proposta foi verificar a possibilidade de utilização de uma mini-câmera para ser instalada junto ao disco de corte de base para auxiliar o operador da colhedora no controle da altura de corte. A segunda proposta avaliada foi a eficiência de um novo mecanismo de controle de altura do corte de base flutuante, capaz de acompanhar as ondulações do terreno. Observou-se, durante as safras 1999 / 2000, 2000 / 2001 e 2001 / 2002, que o mecanismo avaliado é eficiente, robusto e que oferece uma rápida resposta na altura requerida. Os resultados obtidos nos testes de campo, indicam que o corte de base flutuante tem um desempenho melhor que o convencional. Demonstram que o índice de impureza mineral na carga, a quantidade de soqueiras arrancadas e de perdas visíveis no campo são menores quando a colhedora trabalha em cana comercial equipada com o conjunto corte basal flutuante. O trabalho, também, avaliou a possibilidade de se utilizar um material alternativo (ferro fundido branco) para as facas dos rolos picadores em substituição ao padrão aço mola, visando, sem sucesso, aumentar a resistência ao desgaste e ao impacto destas peças. A quarta proposta foi o uso de um monitor de perdas instalado no extrator primário da colhedora. Avaliou-se o desempenho deste monitor trabalhando no campo e quantificando as perdas visíveis de cana e a eficiência de limpeza do extrator primário em relação a variação da rotação do ventilador. Utilizou-se para monitorar as perdas um sensor piezoelétrico que apresentou boa sensibilidade aos impactos contra o capuz do extrator primário. Observou-se também uma boa correlação entre os dados de eficiência de limpeza e perdas com os valores registrados pelo monitor. Assim, o presente trabalho visa reduzir os custos do processamento de cana minimizando as perdas e melhorando o desempenho das colhedoras de cana picada, aumentando a competitividade do setor. Abstract: The Brazilian {{sugar cane}} industry crashes 318 millions tones of sugarcane a year. Nowadays, from 5 to 15 % this raw material {{is lost in}} the field, when the harvesting is done by hand or mecanized respectively, given a damage about US$ 450 millions a year, since only 15 % is mechanical harvested. Due to a environmental government law green cane harvesting will be compulsory, in few years, so the losses must be keeping nearly the last number. The hipotesis for this work {{is that it is}} possible to make use of technologicals alternatives, to improve the components and internals systems to process raw material inside the sugar cane chopped harvesters, to minimize this waste. The purpose of this research was to determine the invisible losses (which are impossible to be located in the field) because the visible losses are already known, and the incidence of vegetable impurities (harvester primary extractor’s cleanliness efficiency) in the sugarcane processed by chopper harvesters. Trials carried out under controlled conditions at the maintenance workshop of São João Sugar mill (Araras-SP) and at the agricultural prototypes workshop of Centro de Tecnologia Copersucar (Piracicaba-SP), from January / 1997 till march/ 2000. The harvesters, which stayed stationary, were fed by a conveyor driven by a hydraulic motor. For the tests of invisible losses clean cane whithout leaves, straw and tops was used first, afther that, the wholestalks were processed with leaves and tops, also to determine vegetable impurities in the load, simulating adverse condition of lodged cane crop. The <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cleaning</b> systems velocity, extractors in the harvesters, affected the magnitude of invisible losses and the amount of vegetable impurities in the load. The largest invisible losses in the cane processed by the harvesters occured due to choppers and base cutter waste knives and they were higher at the primary extrator followed by the base cutter in all over the components and internals systems of the harvesters. The harvester had higher invisible losses in cane with leaves than in cane whithout leaves, and they were highest in the hard cane (higher fibre) and lodged and tangled cane. The values of invisible losses and incidence of amount of vegetable impurities (harvester primary extractor’s cleanliness efficiency) in the load, due to the different adjustments of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cleaning</b> systems of the harvesters, are analysed and discussed in this work. Based on the first step data, it intends on the second step to show four proposals to set up, to adjust and to improve the harvester’s components. First of all, this work want to verify to use of a mini camera helping the harvesters’ operators control the base cutter’s height. At the beginning of this research a novel system for controlling base cutter cutting height was designed and manufactured in an attempt to improve the performance of commercial sugarcane chopper harvesters. The system differed from previous attempts to control base cutter height by suspending the base cutter gearbox and associated components as a discrete module incorporating a passive height control system. The advantages offered by this system include the potential for rapid response to cutting height requirements, the elimination of the secondary effects of base cutter height adjustments on topper height setting and, being fully mechanical, the system does not require additional hydraulic or mechanical control. This paper reviews the results of a testing programme undertaken on the floating base cutter system during the 1999 / 2000, 2000 / 2001 and 2001 / 2002 harvesting seasons with machines working in commercial cane fields. The results of the trial programme indicated that the mineral trash levels in loads transported from field to mill were consistently lower from machines fitted with the floating base cutter system relative to standard machines. The amounts of butts left in the field, of roots and stools removed from the field were also lower with the floating base cutter, however, under the conditions of the tests, statistical significance was not achieved. At the end, this research want to assess the chopper knives made of alternative material (white cast iron) to minimize the wearing and breaking by impacts, and it checks the Cane Loss Monitor working on primary extractor aimed to reduce raw material losses and improve the cleanliness of the cane load to the mill The proposed work aims to reduce the sugar cane processed costs minimizing the losses and improves to the chopped harvesters performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{compressed}} air system (CAS) provides {{compressed air}} to station service equipment and to safety-related and nonsafety-related equipment. There may be two systems or subsystems, an instrumentation and control air system (ICAS) which provides control air to safety-related and nonsafety-related components and systems and a station service air system (SSAS) which provides compressed air to nonsafety-related service equipment (e. g., <b>pneumatic</b> tools, <b>cleaning,</b> etc.). If the two systems are interconnected, the area of review includes the ICAS to the outermost isolation valve on all interconnections between the two systems. The review also evaluates {{the quality of the}} compressed air provided by the SSAS to the ICAS, if the SSAS is used as a back up source for the ICAS. If the systems are not connected, review is limited to the ICAS. The portions of the CAS described above are reviewed for compliance with 10 CFR 50, appendix A, General Design Criteria (GDCs) 1, 2, and 5 and 10 CFR 50. 63.

40|$|The United States Navy {{incorporates}} {{many different}} occupations to ensure it achieves its overall mission. These occupations are extremely diversified and present {{a wide spectrum}} of occupational exposures. Many of these exposures have been well studied and documented. However, shipboard pneumatic tool hand-arm vibration, (HAV) and how it relates to different body postures is an area of occupational exposure that has received little attention. The chief objective {{of this study was to}} assess whether there is a difference in hand-arm vibration levels, while working on one of two surface orientations (e. g., horizontal and vertical) among distinctly different <b>pneumatic</b> tools while <b>cleaning</b> or not cleaning. The design of the study evaluated three <b>pneumatic</b> tools <b>cleaning</b> both horizontal and vertical surfaces and the fourth tool only cleaning a horizontal surface. HAV levels were measured to identify the effect horizontal and vertical surface orientations had on the tool. Five subjects were used in the evaluation of the four tools by a random sequencing order. Each subject was required to hold the tool in an idle condition, an activated without cleaning condition, and an activated cleaning condition, (surface contact) for 20 seconds each. These conditions were evaluated in two different surface orientations; horizontal and vertical (except for the 4 th tool). Each subject repeated each of the cleaning/not cleaning conditions three times for a total of 7 measurements per surface. The idle condition was only conducted one time for each tool and surface. The measurements were collected from a Quest, HAVPro instrument using an accelerometer on the pneumatic tool following ISO 5349 - 1 : 2001 and ISO 5349 - 2 : 2001 methods. A three-way ANOVA (subjects by tool, by condition, (cleaning vs. not cleaning) and tool vs. condition) with replicates (not including idle conditions) was conducted on the data. The analysis included the main effects and the interaction of tool and surface orientation. The subjects were treated as a blocking variable. All the main effects and the interaction were significant at p 3 ̆c 0. 0001, except for surface, p 3 ̆c 0. 6396. Surface orientation does not affect HAV levels in pneumatic tools...|$|R

It has a two manual organ by Nelson - unusually the great organ has tracker action but the swell <b>pneumatic.</b> It {{underwent}} <b>cleaning</b> and partial reconstruction in 2012. The great has a fine if not loud open diapason. Originally part of the Wadsley parish, Oughtibridge is now a separate parish although the vicar of Wadsley still appoints the vicar at Oughtibridge. Coronation Park is situated in {{the centre of the}} village by the river and includes a children's playground and tennis courts as well as some fine specimens of trees. Sheffield Canoe Club use the river by the park as their outdoor base. Just across the road from the park is the hall of the Oughtibridge Brass Band who were formed around 1890. The War Memorial sports ground is situated next to the River Don slightly downstream, providing facilities for the village football and cricket teams. The ground was donated by the Silica Firebrick Company in 1921.|$|R
