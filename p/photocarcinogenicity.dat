40|$|The {{carcinogenicity}} (<b>photocarcinogenicity)</b> {{of sunlight}} to human skin {{has been recognized}} {{more than a century}} ago. Last decades numerous experimental studies show that UV rays damage DNA, cause gene mutations leading to the development of malignant tumors such basal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas and melanomas. The tumors occur most frequently in fair skinned people, and the mutations typically are found at dipyrimidine sites with C-T or / and CC-TT tandem double mutations. The authors briefly summarize their investigation of the p 53 suppressor gene, and expose their hypothesis of hTERT involvement in cancerogenesis. Also their underline the importance of UV induced immunosuppression in photocarcinogenesis. Psoriatic patients are exposed to numerous cancerogens in their treatment. A better understanding of the mechanisms of photocarcinogenesis could provide new ways in the treatment of skin tumors...|$|E
40|$|Sunlight is a known human carcinogen. Many {{cosmetics}} contain retinoid-based compounds, such as {{retinyl palmitate}} (RP), either {{to protect the}} skin or to stimulate skin responses that will correct skin damaged by sunlight. However, {{little is known about}} the photodecomposition of some retinoids and the toxicity of these retinoids and their sunlight-induced photodecomposition products on skin. Thus, studies are required to test whether topical application of retinoids enhances the phototoxicity and <b>photocarcinogenicity</b> of sunlight and UV light. Mechanistic studies are needed to provide insight into the disposition of retinoids in vitro and on the skin, and to test thoroughly whether genotoxic damage by UV-induced radicals may participate in any toxicity of topically applied retinoids in the presence of UV light. This paper reports the update information and our experimental results on photostability, photoreactions, and phototoxicity of the natural retinoids including retinol (ROH), retinal, retinoid acid (RA), retinyl acetate, and RP (Figure 1) ...|$|E
40|$|For pharmaceuticals, current {{regulatory}} {{guidance for}} photosafety testing states that studies are warranted for drug candidates that both absorb {{light in the}} range of 290 - 700 nm and that are either applied topically or reach the skin or eyes by systemic exposure. In contrast to standard genotoxicity evaluations, where a positive (or equivocal) result in vitro can be placed into context with additional testing in vivo, there are no equivalent short-term in vivo photogenotoxicity assays in the current photosafety test battery. Therefore, a short-term in vivo assay for the evaluation of a photogenotoxic potential in the skin, the target organ for <b>photocarcinogenicity,</b> was developed in rats. After oral 8 -methoxypsoralen administration, rats were exposed to ultraviolet radiation and sacrificed 3 days after treatment to isolate epidermal cells for subsequent micronucleus (MN) evaluation. Optimal conditions were determined to obtain maximal induction of MN, followed by demonstrating feasibility and reproducibility of the method. The {{results of the present study}} indicate that the in vivo rat skin photomicronucleus test may be a promising tool for detection of photoclastogenicity. Given the association between MN induction and cancer, the assay may also provide a promising tool for the early detection of photocarcinogenesis and help bridge the gap in the existing photosafety testing paradigm. © The Author 2010.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Pimecrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor, is a non-steroidal {{treatment}} {{option in}} patients aged ≥ 2 years with mild-to-moderate atopic eczema (AE). It was approved {{as a viable}} therapeutic option by the FDA in 2001 and in the European Union a year later in 2002. Calcineurin inhibitors inhibit the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines released from T cells and mast cells. In contrast to corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors act specifically on proinflammatory cells. Pimecrolimus shows comparative efficacy to mild topical corticosteroids and a special antipruritic effect. Furthermore, examinations of the systemic absorption of pimecrolimus implicated no systemic immunosuppression. In 2006, the FDA set a black box warning in the packaging materials of pimecrolimus alluding {{to the risk of}} skin malignancy or lymphomas due to theoretical consideration. AREAS COVERED: The authors provide a review of pimecrolimus as a treatment for AE. Specifically, the authors present the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information on pimecrolimus and also review its efficacy. The authors also discuss pimecrolimus' safety and tolerability profile. EXPERT OPINION: Pimecrolimus represents a valuable part of active and proactive therapy in AE. That being said, the long-term safety of topical calcineurin inhibitors remains to be investigated. Given the results from experimental <b>photocarcinogenicity</b> studies, effective sun protection should be employed during the therapy, although an increased risk for skin malignancies and lymphomas was not found in recent studies. Pimecrolimus should be considered as an alternative therapeutic approach in AE treatment management going along with a corticoid-sparing effect...|$|E
40|$|Photosafety {{testing is}} {{of concern for the}} {{evaluation}} of personal care products and pharmaceuticals. Current regulatory guidance state that photosafety should be evaluated for compounds that absorb radiation between 290 and 700 nm with relevant exposure in the skin or eyes. However, oversensitivity and the occurrence of 'pseudo-effects' with current in vitro photo(geno) toxicity assays have become a major problem. Furthermore, at this moment, there are no relevant in vitro assays available to identify the photocarcinogenic potential of compounds, which might result in unnecessary in vivo <b>photocarcinogenicity</b> studies for pharmaceutical ingredients or unnecessary dropouts in the development of ingredients of personal care products. For these reasons, availability of a relevant and highly predictive in vitro model from human origin to identify the photogenotoxic and/or photocarcinogenic potential of compounds is viewed as high priority. In the present study, human skin tissue obtained from surgery was used for developing a photomicronucleus test. Prior to investigations of the photogenotoxic potential of 8 -methoxypsoralen, tissue viability (lactate production and lactate dehydrogenase leakage), cell proliferation (Ki- 67 expression) and the effect of ultraviolet (UV) exposure on viability (MTT test), proliferation (Ki- 67 expression) and p 53 expression were determined. Results of the present study indicate that ex vivo human skin seems to be a relevant method for safety evaluation of compounds that reach the skin in combination with UV exposure. © The Author 2010.

40|$|Photochemical {{genotoxicity}} can {{be detected}} using appropriately adapted versions {{of most of the}} standard in vitro genotoxicity assays. The most sensitive approach to detect potentially photogenotoxic agents seems to be the investigation of DNA damage (DNA strand breakage, chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei) in mammalian cells in vitro. In a previous paper, we proposed the use of the micronucleus assay in Chinese hamster V 79 cells for this purpose. This assay was found suitable to detect various photogenotoxic compounds with different photoactivation mechanisms. In order to extend the experimental experiences with this assay, we present here further data from a screening mode testing of 16 different potential photosensitizers. The photoclastogenic and photocytotoxic potential of the compounds was investigated concomitantly. So far, all substances detected in the photo-micronucleus assay as photogenotoxins also exhibited photocytotoxic properties but not vice versa. Among the compounds tested in the present study, tiaprofenic acid, 5 -MOP, angelicin, nitrazepam, bendroflumethiazide, and dacarbazine were photogenotoxic and photocytotoxic. Further, 6 -mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine was positive for both endpoints, whereas azathioprine was found negative. Azathioprine seems to be an example of a compound which lacks photo(geno) toxic properties in vitro but may be converted to a photosensitizer by enzymatical metabolization. With the results obtained in this study, the data base for the photo-micronucleus assay was extended to 35 compounds, which were tested using the same protocol and the same irradiation conditions. The photogenotoxicity results of all these compounds are summarized and discussed in correlation to their different photoactivation mechanisms, photocytotoxicity and <b>photocarcinogenicity...</b>|$|E
40|$|Objective and methods: This health {{technology}} assessment (HTA) report synthesises systematically randomized controlled studies (RCT) on the therapy of moderate and severe psoriasis vulgaris which were published between 1999 and 2004; it includes some important clinical studies {{which have been}} published after 2004 and thus updates the English HTA report by Griffiths et al. [1]. The major objective is {{the evaluation of the}} medical effectiveness of different therapeutical approaches and the cost effectiveness with relevance for Germany. Results: The major conclusions from the results of medical RCT on moderate and severe psoriasis vulgaris are: Oral fumarates are effective in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris. However, fumarates quiet frequently cause moderate side effects. Cyclosporine and methotrexate are both effective in the treatment of severe psoriasis vulgaris. Both substances have a different spectrum of side effects which may limit the individual applicability. Acetritin is only moderately effective in the treatment of severe psoriasis of the plaque type. Calcipotriol or UV-radiation used at the same time can increase the clinical effectiveness of acetritin. Systemic PUVA, balneo-PUVA and UVB therapy are all effective for the treatment of severe psoriasis. The combination of UV therapy with vitamin D 3 analogues or with topical steroids is more effective than the treatment with UV radiation alone. Saltwater baths increase the effectiveness of UVB therapy. No RCT on the therapeutical effects of topical tar or of dithranol in combination with UV therapy have been published so far. A continuous therapy with PUVA should not be applied due to its proven <b>photocarcinogenicity.</b> Three substances from the group of biologicals (Efalizumab, Etanercept, and Infliximab) are now available in Europe and a further substance (Alefacept) is available in the USA for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. All biologicals have been effective in placebo controlled studies. The substances differ in the times until a clinical effect is observable, in the spectrum of side effects and in their efficiency on psoriasis arthritis. From health-economic studies considering both costs and clinical efficiency oral fumarates appear to be superior to acitretin or cyclosporine (although cyclosporine appears to be more effective in severe psoriasis). From the health economic view methotrexate is equivalent with UVB or PUVA and superior to cyclosporine. The therapy options UVB, UVB plus calcipotriol and PUVA are equivalent and superior to balneo-phototherapy. Biologicals are cost intensive and should be used when other approaches are not sufficient or are not applicable due to their side effects. The HTA report summarizes some health-economic studies on dithranol, on calcipotriol and on the combination with tar and UV light. No RCT have been published for the treatment of severe psoriasis with these agents alone but it appears to be certain that these substances are effective in severe psoriasis as well. DiscussionThe spectrum of therapeutical options has fortunately increased during the last years. It must be emphasized that a number of therapeutical procedures exist which are not discussed in detail in this HTA. This is due to the search strategy of literature: Only RCT performed with patients with moderate and/or severe psoriasis vulgaris were included into this evaluation. This led to the exclusion of a number of substances which are traditionally used alone or in combination for the treatment of moderate or severe psoriasis vulgaris (e. g. dithranol, salicyc acid, tar, corticosteroids and topical retinoids). Moreover, other approaches which include neither drugs nor UV light are not discussed in this HTA although the authors believe in the importance of psychotherapeutical interventions, educational approaches and combined medical and non-medical approaches in rehabilitational medicine in the management of psoriasis vulgaris. The transferability of the health economic evaluations is strongly limited by the fact that all included health economic evaluations except one were not aligned to a German setting. A future research question will be the evaluation of the duration of remission and relapse ratios in the context of different therapy options of moderate and severe psoriasis. Moreover, the consideration of combined outcomes such as the improvement of psoriatic symptoms and the decrease of symptoms in accompanying psoriasis arthritis represents a future requirement of health assessment. Conclusions: From the clinical point of view it is positive that the spectrum of therapeutic procedures for a chronic severe skin disease has increased continuously during the last years. In cases of individual contraindications or individual inefficacies it is now possible to try alternative approaches. Moreover the risk of long-term side effects can be reduced by changing the therapeutical procedure after some time (so-called rotation therapy). The therapeutical algorithm for severe psoriasis vulgaris now includes photo(chemo-) therapy in combination with topical substances, oral fumaric acid esters, retinoids (in combination with phototherapy or topical substances), methotrexate, cylosporine and the new biologics. Future studies should address therapeutical approaches which can not easily be studied by RCT, e. g. physical, balneological, climate approaches, educational programs and complex rehabilitation therapy which all may have positive effects on individuals with severe psoriasis. As in medical therapy management of moderate and severe psoriasis the economic evaluation also points out the way of a strategic therapy concept which corresponds to a large extent to the algorithm in medical practice...|$|E
