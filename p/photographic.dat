5|$|On {{the fatal}} flight, 8,545 feet of <b>photographic</b> film were carried as cargo. Air Navigation Orders {{specified}} that {{a maximum of}} 3,000 feet of <b>photographic</b> film may be carried.|$|E
5|$|Selenium {{is used in}} the toning of <b>photographic</b> prints, and it is sold as a toner by {{numerous}} <b>photographic</b> manufacturers. Selenium intensifies and extends the tonal range of black-and-white <b>photographic</b> images and improves the permanence of prints.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{considerable}} <b>photographic</b> record of early Princes Street, largely thanks to the presence in the street of the studios of the Burton Brothers, pioneering New Zealand photographers. Many of their images, {{and those of other}} early Dunedin photographers, were collated and published in a series of books by <b>photographic</b> historian Hardwicke Knight, one of which — a collection of <b>photographic</b> works by Daniel Louis Mundy — was entitled Princes Street by gaslight (1977).|$|E
5|$|As his curios {{business}} developed, with {{branches in}} Rangoon, Mandalay {{but also in}} Colombo and London, he also acquired the <b>Photographic</b> Art Gallery in Mandalay in 1903, another <b>photographic</b> studio. In his old age, Felice Beato had become an important business party in Colonial Burma, involved in many enterprises from electric works to life insurance and mining.|$|E

5|$|Examples of Rossier's {{views of}} Switzerland {{are held in}} several {{institutions}} and private collections in that country. Rossier took the first commercial photographs of China and Japan, and they are now quite rare. He complained at times of the adverse effects of the climate on his <b>photographic</b> chemicals {{and some of his}} negatives may have been damaged en route to London from Asia. Though his surviving images are scarce, his importance to the early history of photography in Asia is great. Before his arrival in Japan in 1859, Japanese students of photography had struggled to produce satisfactory images, but Rossier's experience, instruction, and contacts with suppliers of <b>photographic</b> materials were extremely helpful in the development of an autonomous <b>photographic</b> tradition in Japan.|$|E
5|$|From Constitución to Diagonal Norte, {{the line}} {{features}} murals of Iberian landscapes created by Spanish {{artists such as}} Ignacio Zuloaga and Fernando Álvarez de Sotomayor y Zaragoza, which {{date back to the}} time of the line's opening by CHADOPyF. General San Martín station includes <b>photographic</b> reproductions of the Museo de la Ciudad (City Museum) activities, <b>photographic</b> reproductions and images of the Plaza San Martín and <b>photographic</b> reproductions of streets and building of the South zone of the City.|$|E
5|$|In the Apollo11 <b>photographic</b> record {{there are}} only five images of Armstrong partly shown or reflected. The mission was planned to the minute, with the {{majority}} of <b>photographic</b> tasks to be performed by Armstrong with a single Hasselblad camera.|$|E
5|$|Leavitt also {{developed}} {{and continued to}} refine the Harvard Standard for <b>photographic</b> measurements, a logarithmic scale that orders stars by brightness over 17 magnitudes. She initially analyzed 299 plates from 13 telescopes to construct her scale, which was accepted by the International Committee of <b>Photographic</b> Magnitudes in 1913.|$|E

5|$|Acetic {{anhydride}} is an acetylation agent. As such, {{its major}} application is for cellulose acetate, a synthetic textile {{also used for}} <b>photographic</b> film. Acetic anhydride is also a reagent {{for the production of}} heroin and other compounds.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to the stock exchange, Kertész decided to emigrate, to study at one of France's <b>photographic</b> schools. His mother dissuaded him, {{and he did not}} emigrate for several years. Working during the day at the exchange, he pursued photography the rest of the time.|$|E
5|$|After two sabbaticals to Harvard, Baker's {{interest}} {{moved from}} photometry to the Milky Way. In 1939 the 30-inch reflector {{was replaced with}} a Ross <b>photographic</b> telescope and {{for more than ten}} years after that, 1939 through 1951 Baker used the observatory's <b>photographic</b> telescope to help count the stars in the Milky Way and determine their distribution as part of Harvard's Star Counting Circuit. This would be the primary research until Baker's retirement in 1951. The 12-inch refractor was only used for instruction, public open houses and for visiting school groups.|$|E
5|$|Although Rossier's time in Japan {{was brief}} and the {{surviving}} <b>photographic</b> legacy of his sojourn is scant, he nevertheless had a lasting impact on photography in the country.|$|E
5|$|Arguably {{the most}} notable {{resident}} of Low Fell was Sir Joseph Swan. Swan, most famous as {{the inventor of the}} incandescent lightbulb (though also instrumental in improvements to <b>photographic</b> film and rechargeable batteries), lived at Underhill, 99 Kells Lane in Low Fell between 1869 and 1883.|$|E
5|$|At this time, Ueno Hikoma and Horie Kuwajirō also {{received}} <b>photographic</b> instruction from Rossier. Apparently Ueno had {{originally intended to}} learn not only the practice of photography but also the manufacture of cameras. The encounter with Rossier seems to have convinced Ueno to pursue photography as a career, {{but he was so}} overwhelmed by the technology of the camera that he quickly dropped the notion of making one himself. Within a few months, he and Horie had purchased a French camera and chemicals, thereafter launching their independent <b>photographic</b> careers.|$|E
5|$|Available sources do not {{acknowledge}} that Audacious was {{fitted with a}} fire-control director {{on the roof of}} the spotting top before her loss, but <b>photographic</b> evidence shows one visible as she was sinking.|$|E
5|$|Before 1907, all {{magnitude}} {{measurements for}} stars were obtained through visual comparison of relative brightness, {{a process that}} was slow and inexact. Later <b>photographic</b> methods would use starlight to make a representation on a <b>photographic</b> plate. Regardless, neither method was adequate for quantitative measurements. The drawback of previous methods of measuring stellar magnitude made the use of electricity for empirically gathering astronomical data revolutionary for the science of astronomy. Joel Stebbins' pioneering research for astronomical photometry {{took place at the}} observatory.|$|E
5|$|Carney {{is married}} to a free-lance journalist, Victoria Butler. He has a {{daughter}} from a previous marriage. He and his wife, both writers, have published, with a British photographer, a <b>photographic</b> essay on the Sudan.|$|E
5|$|Cott was a {{founding}} member of the Society of Wildlife Artists, and a fellow of the Royal <b>Photographic</b> Society. From material gathered in field expeditions, he made contributions to the Cambridge University zoological museum.|$|E
5|$|Eakins {{made several}} on-site oil {{sketches}} and <b>photographic</b> studies before painting The Swimming Hole. It is unknown whether the photographs were taken before the oil sketches were produced {{or vice versa}} (or, indeed, whether they were created on the same day).|$|E
5|$|Felice Beato {{set up a}} <b>photographic</b> {{studio in}} Mandalay and, in 1894, a curiosa and {{antiques}} dealership, running both businesses separately and, according to records at the time, very successfully.|$|E
5|$|Following a brief {{military}} career, including {{service in}} the American Civil War, he became a successful entrepreneur and commercial photographer. His <b>photographic</b> work was highly regarded, particularly his hand-coloured portraits and landscapes, which he sold mostly to foreign residents and visitors to the country.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, the British Secret Intelligence Service Chief of Air Intelligence, Wing Commander F. W. Winterbotham, {{developed}} {{aerial photograph}} techniques {{in collaboration with}} the French. The task was to gather a record of German targets. By the summer, 1939, RAF Bomber Command's No. 2 Group RAF was carrying out this role. However, various problems with standard equipment {{led to the formation of}} specialist formations for this duty. One of the first squadrons to act as a PR (<b>Photographic</b> reconnaissance) unit was No. 212 Squadron RAF, which saw service in the campaigns in Western Europe, in May and June 1940 under Fighter Command's control. However, at the end of that campaign, the Admiralty pressed its case for the need for coastal and sea reconnaissance. With operations now over, owing to the evacuation of northern Europe by the Allies, these reconnaissance operations were given to Coastal Command on 18 June 1940. This included the Interpretation Unit, which analysed <b>photographic</b> evidence. The organisation was called the PRU (<b>Photographic</b> Reconnaissance Unit). It was administered by No. 16 Group RAF, but under the operational control of Coastal Command.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 {{a further}} survey {{was carried out}} by Bath and Camerton Archaeological Society and the Bath and North East Somerset Archaeological Officer. This {{involved}} high data density magnetometer, resistance pseudosection profiles and <b>photographic</b> surveys showed a new henge entrance and further detail of post holes.|$|E
5|$|In the 21st century, Crawford's <b>photographic</b> archive {{stored at}} Oxford University's Institute of Archaeology was still {{consulted}} by archaeologists seeking to view how various sites {{appeared during the}} first half of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Kikai’s other {{long-term}} <b>photographic</b> {{projects are}} of working and residential neighborhoods in and near Tokyo, and {{of people and}} scenes in India and Turkey. All these are black and white. However, his occasional diversions have included color photographs of the Gotō Islands and even of nudes.|$|E

5|$|Neon {{played a}} role in the basic {{understanding}} of the nature of atoms in 1913, when J. J. Thomson, as part of his exploration into the composition of canal rays, channeled streams of neon ions through a magnetic and an electric field and measured the deflection of the streams with a <b>photographic</b> plate. Thomson observed two separate patches of light on the <b>photographic</b> plate (see image), which suggested two different parabolas of deflection. Thomson eventually concluded that some of the atoms in the neon gas were of higher mass than the rest. Though not understood at the time by Thomson, this was the first discovery of isotopes of stable atoms. Thomson's device was a crude version of the instrument we now term a mass spectrometer.|$|E
5|$|One model had its lens {{fixed to}} a bag bellows. A scissor {{mechanism}} held the bellows in its expanded state until {{the photo was}} taken, but condensed it immediately afterwards. This allowed one exposure of size 6cm×9cm on a <b>photographic</b> plate, at a focal length of 85mm.|$|E
