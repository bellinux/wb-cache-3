This requirement can be satisfied only by using a well-defined System-level design methodology and by reducing the migration time between the algorithm development language and the hardware specification language. In this report, we propose to use the SpecC language for the development (specification and validation) of new control algorithms.

30|$|Aromatic {{oxidation}} requires {{large amounts}} of heat {{to be removed from}} the reaction zone to maintain the temperature and keep the overall <b>process</b> <b>under</b> <b>control.</b> An uncontrolled reaction would cause a severe reduction of yields (complete combustion would be favored) as well as the loss of catalyst life [23]. Furthermore, it is a self-amplifying problem, i.e., an increase in temperature causes more combustion reactions that would further increase the temperature. Proper reactor design and heat management are therefore key aspects in industrial processes. Reaction at near-isothermal conditions is preferred to maintain optimal catalyst efficiency and product selectivity. Multitubular reactors and fluidized beds with heat exchange internals have been widely used for this purpose; after all, these configurations are suitable to minimize the temperature gradients across the catalyst bed.|$|E
