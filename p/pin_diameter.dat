25|$|Brazil, {{which had}} been using mostly Europlugs, and NEMA 1–15 and NEMA 5–15 standards, adopted a (non-compliant) variant of IEC 60906-1 as the {{national}} standard in 1998 under specification NBR14136 (revised in 2002). These are used for both 220 volt and 127 volt regions of the country, despite the IEC 60906-2 recommendation that NEMA 5-15 be used for 120V connections. There {{are two types of}} sockets and plugs in NBR 14136: one for 10A, with a 4.0mm <b>pin</b> <b>diameter,</b> and another for 20A, with a 4.8mm <b>pin</b> <b>diameter.</b> This differs from IEC 60906-1 which specifies a <b>pin</b> <b>diameter</b> of 4.5mm and a rating of 16A. NBR 14136 was not enforced in that country until 2007, when its adoption was made optional for manufacturers. It became compulsory on January 1, 2010.|$|E
2500|$|In {{printed circuit}} board {{assembly}} individual connector pins are sometimes pressed/swaged into place using an arbor press. [...] Some pins have a hollow end that is pressed over by the arbor's tool to form a mushroom-shaped retaining head.

2500|$|While it {{is often}} stated that the COF is a [...] "material property," [...] it is better {{categorized}} as a [...] "system property." [...] Unlike true material properties (such as conductivity, dielectric constant, yield strength), the COF for any two materials depends on system variables like temperature, velocity, atmosphere and also what are now popularly described as aging and deaging times; {{as well as on}} geometric properties of the interface between the materials, namely surface structure. For example, a copper pin sliding against a thick copper plate can have a COF that varies from 0.6 at low speeds (metal sliding against metal) to below 0.2 at high speeds when the copper surface begins to melt due to frictional heating. The latter speed, of course, does not determine the COF uniquely; if the <b>pin</b> <b>diameter</b> is increased so that the frictional heating is removed rapidly, the temperature drops, the pin remains solid and the COF rises to that of a 'low speed' test.|$|E

2500|$|Plugs and sockets {{are usually}} {{designed}} together, with the contacts of the socket part designed {{to accept the}} specific <b>pin</b> <b>diameter,</b> pin length, and pin spacing of the mating plug part. However, there is no socket defined by EN50075; neither is there a socket specified in CEE7 to accept only [...] pins or {{the profile of a}} Europlug. (There are examples of sockets on the market which accept only such plugs, sometimes in multiples, but these meet no recognized standard.) Instead of being designed with a matching socket, the Europlug was designed to be compatible with a range of sockets in common use throughout mainland Europe. These sockets, including the CEE7/1, CEE7/3 (German/"Schuko"), CEE7/5 (French), and most Israeli, Swiss, Danish and Italian sockets, were designed to accept pins of various diameters, mainly 4.8mm but also 4.0mm and 4.5mm, and are usually fed by final circuits with either 10 A or 16 A overcurrent protection devices. To improve contact with socket parts intended to receive pins having a diameter larger than 4.0mm, the Europlug has two round, slightly flexible pins which converge slightly towards their free ends.|$|E

50|$|Progressive {{hardware}} {{improvements to}} impact printers boosted the carriage speed, added more (typeface) font options, increased the dot density (from 60 dpi up to 240 dpi), and added color printing. Faster carriage speeds meant faster (and sometimes louder) printing. Additional typefaces allowed {{the user to}} vary the text appearance of printouts. Proportional-spaced fonts allowed the printer to imitate the non-uniform character widths of a typesetter. Increased dot density allowed for more detailed, darker printouts. The impact pins of the printhead were constrained to a minimum size (for structural durability), and dot densities above 100 dpi merely caused adjacent dots to overlap.

Comparison of load at fracture initiation with loading rate shows that as loading rate increases, the load at fracture initiation also rises for all <b>pin</b> <b>diameters</b> tested.
