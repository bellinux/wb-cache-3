5|$|The {{first episode}} opens with an {{assassination}} attempt on president Teikun Ō of Zheng Fa; he survives, but he later finds his head bodyguard, Gai Tojiro, dead. Asked by the Chief <b>Prosecutor</b> <b>to</b> investigate, {{and in the process}} getting involved with the infamous assassin Shelly de Killer, Edgeworth discovers that Tojiro's second-in-command Manosuke Naitō had killed Tojiro to replace him as head bodyguard, and that the assassination attempt was staged by the president to reverse his declining popularity.|$|E
5|$|If {{the trial}} judge erroneously permits the {{striking}} of a juror under Batson, and the error is preserved, the only remedy is automatic reversal. If {{the trial judge}} erroneously prevents the striking of a juror under Batson, and the juror is seated, the Constitution permits a jurisdiction to utilize harmless error analysis. The race of the defendant is irrelevant to a Batson claim. Batson also permits the <b>prosecutor</b> <b>to</b> challenge defense peremptory strikes ("reverse Batson"). And, Batson applies equally to race and gender.|$|E

5|$|In United States v. Phillips (1832), the Court {{dismissed}} {{a criminal}} action, on {{the motion of}} the Attorney General, pursuant to the district prosecutor's filing of a nolle prosequi motion (a motion by the <b>prosecutor</b> <b>to</b> dismiss the case) in the trial court, even though the nolle prosequi motion was filed after the writ of error issued from the Supreme Court. Phillips has been cited as an early example of judicial recognition of the norm of prosecutorial enforcement discretion and as an example of mootness (although the Phillips Court did not use that term). The underlying case had involved the prosecution of Zalegman Phillips, a prominent Philadelphia attorney, for interfering with diplomatic immunity, as protected by the Crimes Act of 1790, by filing a lawsuit against a former diplomat. The question certified was whether the provision extended to former diplomats.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 2009 the ICC Presidency {{assigned}} {{the situation in}} Kenya to Pre-Trial Chamber II and the prosecutor made an application to that chamber for authorisation to open a formal investigation on 26 November. The judges of the pre-trial chamber granted this authorisation on 31 March 2010. The judges who made this decision, Ekaterina Trendafilova, Hans-Peter Kaul and Cuno Tarfusser noted in their written ruling that while Article 15 of the Rome Statute does allow for the <b>Prosecutor</b> <b>to</b> investigate and prosecute a case of his own volition, {{this is one of}} the more controversial aspects of the ICC. In the ICC's history, this case was the first time the Prosecutor decided to investigate a case in this manner, with all prior cases being referred to the Court either by a national government, or by the United Nations Security Council.|$|E
5|$|Pre-Trial Chamber II {{ruled that}} there were {{reasonable}} grounds to be believe that William Ruto and Henry Kosgey were criminally responsible as indirect co-perpetrators of the crimes outlined in counts 1, 2 and 4, {{but in the case}} of Joshua Sang it ruled that his involvement was not essential to the commission of the crimes and so only ruled {{that there were}} grounds to believe he otherwise contributed to the crimes. The Chamber rejected the request by the <b>Prosecutor</b> <b>to</b> include the charge of torture in count 3. In the case of Kenyatta, Muthaura and Ali the Chamber ruled that there were reasonable grounds to believe that Uhuru Kenyatta and Francis Muthaura were guilty as indirect co-perpetrators of the crimes of which they were accused {{but in the case of}} Mohammed Ali, the Chamber ruled that his contribution was not essential to the commission of the crimes and so he was charged with having otherwise contributed.|$|E

5|$|The first living koala in Britain {{arrived in}} 1881, {{purchased}} by the Zoological Society of London. As related by <b>prosecutor</b> <b>to</b> the society, William Alexander Forbes, the animal suffered an accidental demise when the heavy lid of a washstand fell on {{it and it was}} unable to free itself. Forbes used the opportunity to dissect the fresh female specimen, thus was able to provide explicit anatomical details on the female reproductive system, the brain, and the liver—parts not previously described by Owen, who had access only to preserved specimens. Scottish embryologist William Caldwell—well known in scientific circles for determining the reproductive mechanism of the platypus—described the uterine development of the koala in 1884, and used the new information to convincingly place the koala and the monotremes into an evolutionary time frame.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} and final case, Phoenix is visiting a {{mountain}} retreat with Maya and Pearl when a fellow guest, Elise Deauxnim, is murdered. While looking for Maya, he falls into a river and becomes ill, forcing Edgeworth and Franziska to temporarily fill in as attorney and <b>prosecutor</b> <b>to</b> keep his client, a nun named Iris, from being found guilty. When Phoenix returns, he explains that Elise is really Maya's long-lost mother, Misty Fey, and that her death {{was the result of}} a plan engineered by her sister Morgan to kill Maya with the help of the now deceased Dahlia, who turns out to be Iris's twin. Through cross-examination, Phoenix reveals that not only is Dahlia impersonating Iris, she is using Maya's body to do so. With Mia's help, Dahlia is exorcised from Maya and Iris is declared innocent. Godot is revealed as the one responsible for killing Misty to protect Maya, leading to the discovery of his true identity: Diego Armando. Having spent many years blaming Phoenix for Mia's death, he sought revenge, but concedes that Phoenix has done more to continue her legacy than him. Iris also reveals that she posed as Dahlia while Phoenix was attending college to protect him, ended up falling in love with him, and that she regrets her failure to stop her sister from becoming a criminal. Reuniting with his friends, Phoenix celebrates finally being free of his past.|$|E

The independence of the public <b>prosecutor</b> is essential <b>to</b> ensure a free and fair trial in the court. However, in India, scant {{attention is paid to}} this crucial office and its importance is regularly undermined by vested interests in the system.|$|R

25|$|The Carabinieri's ROS (Raggruppamento Operativo Speciale) {{persuaded the}} Palermo Public Prosecutor's Office not to {{immediately}} search the Riina's apartment, and then abandoned surveillance {{of the apartment}} after six hours leaving it unprotected. The apartment was only raided 18 days later {{but it had been}} completely emptied. According to the Carabinieri commanders the house was abandoned because they didn't consider it to be important and they actually never told the <b>prosecutor</b> <b>to</b> be willing to maintain the surveillance during the following days.|$|E

BC NDP Public Safety Critic and Port Coquitlam MLA Mike Farnworth called for a special <b>prosecutor</b> <b>to</b> be appointed to investigate the incident, citing concerns of police investigating themselves.|$|E
25|$|In Brady v.

In some cases, the production of documents must be made at a time prior to that required by the Jencks Act.
