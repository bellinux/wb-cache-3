40|$|This paper {{introduces}} extractive cooling {{from the}} 2 nd stage <b>pulse</b> tube and <b>regenerator</b> in a two-stage 4 K pulse tube cryocooler. Excess cooling can be distributed cooling along the <b>pulse</b> tube and <b>regenerator</b> or intermediate cooling {{at a certain}} location on the <b>pulse</b> tube and <b>regenerator.</b> The 2 nd stage pulse tube provides significantly more capacity of distributed cooling than the regenerator with less effect of cooling performance on both stages. Two intermediate heat exchangers mounted on the 2 nd stage <b>pulse</b> tube and <b>regenerator</b> can provide cooling capacities of 0. 5 W to 3. 5 W at temperatures between 6. 5 K to 26 K without affecting the 2 nd stage performance.

Assuming simple sinusoidal oscillations, the static and oscillatory pressures, velocities and temperatures have been determined for a model that includes a compressible gas and imperfect thermal contact between the gas and the regenerator matrix. For realistic material parameters, the analysis reveals that the pressure and, velocity oscillations are largely independent of details of the thermal contact between the gas and the solid matrix. Only the temperature oscillations depend on this contact. Suggestions for optimizing the design of a regenerator are given...|$|R

40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. Multistage {{pulse tube}} cryocoolers require {{separate}} phase shifters for each stage. For sufficiently high frequency and acoustic power, the inertance tube {{is commonly used}} for such phase shifting. For Stirling-type, multistage pulse tube cryocoolers, the warm end of the coldest pulse tube is often heat sunk to the cold end of a warmer stage rather than at room temperature to improve the figure of merit for the pulse tube and/or to achieve a larger phase shift with a cold inertance tube. The use of a secondary <b>pulse</b> tube or <b>regenerator</b> between the main pulse tube and a phase shifter allows the phase shifter to operate at room temperature where space is more readily available. It also allows {{for the use of}} commercially available pressure oscillators as expanders. The secondary regenerator amplifies the acoustic power, so a room temperature inertance tube may perform as well as a cold one. A secondary pulse tube transfers acoustic power to room temperature without amplification, so a rather small warm expander or displacer can provide the optimum phase shift even in a low-power cryocooler. In this paper, we model the behavior of these secondary <b>pulse</b> tubes and <b>regenerators</b> using REGEN 3. 3 and present results to assist in selecting the optimum geometry and the optimum characteristics for the expander. We show that acoustic power flows from cold to hot in such systems can be modeled with REGEN 3. 3 by changing the flow phase by 180 degrees...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a two-stage Pulse Tube Cryocooler (PTC) which produces a no-load temperature of similar to 3 K and delivers a refrigeration power of similar to 250 mW at 5 K is reported in this work. The system uses stainless steel meshes along with lead (Pb) granules and combinations of Pb, Er 3 Ni and HoCu 2 in layered structures as {{the first and second}} stage regenerator materials respectively. With Helium as a working fluid, the pressure oscillations are generated using a 6 kW water-cooled Helium compressor along with an indigenous rotary valve. Different configurations of pulse tube systems have been experimentally studied, by both varying the dimensions of <b>pulse</b> tubes and <b>regenerators</b> as well as the second stage regenerator material composition. The pulse tube Cryocooler has been numerically analyzed by using both the isothermal model and the model based on solving the energy equations.

40|$|Pulse Tube Refrigerators (PTR) {{have become}} highly {{popular due to}} their {{inherent}} advan-tages like absence of moving parts at the cold end, reduced vibration, high reliability, light weight, and simple construction. There are various configurations possible in PTRs like inline, U-type, coaxial, and annular. Also, different phase-shifting mechanisms like orifice valve, double-inlet valve, inertance tube, etc. are in practice. The present work aims to study and compare the performance of an inline and a U-type configuration of a single-stage, Stirling-type PTR developed in our laboratory, keeping the same dimensions for the pulse tube and the regenerator in both. The inline configuration reached a minimum temperature of 48. 2 ¶K, while the PTR with the U-type configuration with the same <b>pulse</b> tube and <b>regenerator</b> dimensions reached about 70 ¶K. The U-type configuration has been further studied to understand its performance dependence on the connecting tube diameter and length. Additional investigations were carried out to study and compare the performance of these inline and U-type configurations for different operating parameters like charge pressure, frequency of operation, etc. and design parameters like length of inertance tube.

40|$|A {{two stage}} Pulse Tube Cryocooler (PTC) is {{designed}} and fabricated which reaches a no-load temperature of 2. 5 K {{in the second}} stage and similar to 60 K {{in the first stage}} respectively. The system provides a cooling power of similar to 250 mW at 5 K in the second stage. Stainless steel meshes (size 200) and lead (Pb) granules are used as the first stage regenerator materials and combination of Pb with Er 3 Ni / HoCu 2 are used as the second stage regenerator materials. The system operates at 1. 6 Hz using a 6 kW water cooled helium compressor. Studies conducted by varying the dimensions of <b>Pulse</b> Tubes and <b>regenerators</b> show that the dimensions of the Pulse Tubes are more critical to the performance of the Cryocooler than those of the regenerators. Experimental studies show that the optimum volume ratios of Er 3 Ni to Pb and HoCu 2 to Pb in the second stage regenerator should be 3 : 2 and 2 : 3 respectively for the best performance. Further, systems with HoCu 2 performed better than those with Er 3 Ni. The theoretical analysis of the system has been carried out using a simple isothermal model. The experimentally measured cooling powers are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a single-stage coaxial pulse tube refrigerator used as an oxygen liquefier is discussed. The liquefier is a half-size laboratory unit for NASA/JSC to demonstrate the technology of liquefying and storing oxygen on Mars. The liquefier {{would be part of}} a plant that extracts oxygen from the Martian carbon dioxide atmosphere and stores the oxygen in liquid form. The liquid oxygen could then be used either for the oxidizer of a fuel or for breathing in a manned mission. The <b>pulse</b> tube and <b>regenerator,</b> which are arranged coaxially, provide 18. 8 W of cooling at 90 K with 222 W of PV input power. The resulting coefficient of performance (COP) is 20. 0 % of the Carnot value based on PV input power, among the highest ever achieved. Liquid nitrogen was produced at a rate of 1. 75 g/min (2. 17 cm 3 /min) with 215 W of PV input power. Oxygen should be produced at about 2. 7 g/min (2. 37 cm 3 /min). While this cooler is not a flight version, it is a flight-like design similar to what would be used on a mission.

The second stage of the system provides a refrigeration power of similar to 250 mW at 5. 0 K. The system uses stainless steel meshes (mesh size 200) along with lead (Pb) granules and combinations of Pb, Er 3 Ni, and HoCu 2 as {{the first and second}} stage regenerator materials, respectively. Experimental studies have been carried out on different pulse tube configurations by varying the dimensions of the <b>pulse</b> tubes and <b>regenerators</b> to arrive at the best one, which leads to the lowest no-load second stage cold head temperature. Using this configuration, detailed experimental studies have been conducted by varying the volume percentage ratios of the second stage regenerator materials such as HoCu 2, Er 3 Ni, and Pb (with an average grain size of similar to 250 mu m). This article presents the results of our experimental studies on cryocoolers with the regenerator material arranged in layered structures. Comparative studies have also been presented for specific cases where the regenerator materials are arranged as a homogeneous mixture in the second stage. The experimental results clearly indicate that the design of PTCs should use only layered structures of regenerator materials and not homogenous mixtures...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{refrigeration}} is {{an emerging}} technology {{based on the}} magnetocaloric effect in solid-state refrigerants. This technology offers a smaller global environmental impact than the refrigeration obtained {{by means of the}} classical vapor compression machines operating with fluids such as HFCs. The Active Magnetic Regenerative Refrigeration (AMRR) is currently the most studied ant tested magnetic cycle. It combines the regenerative properties of a high specific heat solid porous matrix with the ability of performing thermo-magnetic cycles thanks to the magnetocaloric property of the refrigerant; while a fluid <b>pulsing</b> through the <b>regenerator</b> works as a heat transfer medium. An active magnetic regenerator can provide larger temperature spans making up for the local small temperature variation of the refrigerant. In the present paper, a practical model for predicting the performance and efficiency of an AMRR cycle has been developed. The model evaluates both the refrigerant properties and the entire cycle of an AMR operating in conformity with a Brayton regenerative cycle. The magnetocaloric material of choice is gadolinium, while the heat transfer medium is liquid water. With this model can be predicted the refrigeration capacity, the power consumption and consequently the Coefficient of Performance. The results show a greater COP when compared to a classical vapor compression plant working between the same temperature levels.

40|$|The salient {{features}} of a Stirling-type Pulse Tube Refrigerator (PTR) are its compactness, low vibration, high frequency of operation, and longevity. The flow in the pulse tube is complex because of its oscillatory nature. The flow pattern {{plays an important role}} in the performance of the pulse tube. Various design parameters like dimensions of the <b>pulse</b> tube, the <b>regenerator,</b> and operating parameters like pressure and frequency affect pulse tube performance. The cold end heat exchanger forms the most important component of the PTR, as the cooling effect is distributed from this component. This paper evaluates the experimental performance of a PTR for different configurations of the cold end heat exchanger in terms of cool down curve, lowest temperature reached, and cooling power at 80 K. The performance of the PTR is studied using a stack of coarse copper meshes in the cold heat exchanger. A similar investigation is carried out by replacing the meshes with a tapered finned copper block in order to get better heat transfer at the cold end. The results show a substantial improvement in the performance of the PTR. It is also found that the optimum frequency gets affected by such changes. In another system, the study is extended to investigate the effect of tapering the cold end heat exchanger using coarse copper meshes. The included taper angle is varied, and its effect on the performance of the PTR is studied...|$|R
40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. Macroscopic models used in {{the design}} and {{development}} of <b>pulse</b> tube cryocooler <b>regenerators</b> do not explicitly consider the complex microscopic interaction of the working fluid as it flows through the interstitial passages formed by the solid matrix. Rather, the governing equations for these models are typically formulated in terms of average macroscopic quantities (e. g., the bulk velocity and temperature within the interstitial passage) and require user input in the form of friction factor and Nusselt number to account for microscopic fluid-to-solid interactions. Traditionally, the friction factor and Nusselt number are correlated from steady flow experimental data, despite the oscillatory flow that exists within the regenerator. It is not clear how well this technique works and how much the failure to account for oscillating flow affects the performance predicted by a macroscopic model of a regenerator. In addition, correlations from steady flow are limited in terms of the matrix configuration and the range of the conditions. This paper outlines the development of a design tool that is capable of deriving Nusselt number and friction factor correlations based on computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis of a unit-cell model that considers the microscopic interactions between the fluid and solid. The model explicitly includes the oscillating flow effects, can be applied to arbitrary matrix geometry, and can be used to provide information over a large range of operating conditions. This paper presents the details of the model and the data reduction process as well as preliminary results for a typical regenerator geometry...|$|R
40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. In a coaxial {{pulse tube}} cryocooler, the radial thermal {{conduction}} between the pulse tube and the regenerator {{has a large}} influence on cryocooler performance. Caused by the temperature mismatch between the <b>pulse</b> tube and <b>regenerator,</b> this phenomenon needs to be carefully considered during the cryocooler design process. In this work, models with and without radial thermal conduction between the regenerator and its coaxial pulse tube have been constructed to analyze the mechanism and predict its effect on cryocooler performance. Experiments {{have been carried out}} to characterize the coaxial pulse tube axial temperature distribution under a variety of working conditions. A linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) has been used to analyze the pressure-flow phase angle in the test system. The results were then compared with the simulated results and were used to provide direction for further optimization. The simulation results show that a steady radial thermal conduction exists between the pulse tube and the regenerator, and this heat transfer can affect the fluid dynamics and thermodynamics in the system. Experiments show that the shape of the wall temperature distribution curve is a useful indicator of the cooler performance and the appropriateness of the arrangement of the pulse tube and the regenerator for achieving optimal working conditions. The simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental data, which verifies the numerical simulation modeling. To validate the theoretical and experimental studies, the configuration of a previous 2 W at 60 K experimental prototype PT was redesigned and optimized to get an optimal axial temperature match between the <b>regenerator</b> and <b>pulse</b> tube. The new experimental prototype achieved a COP of 2 % at 60 K and 4. 3 % at 80 K with around 100 W of input electric power...|$|R
