50|$|The {{effect of}} wear on {{a roller chain}} is to {{increase}} the pitch (spacing of the links), causing the chain to grow longer. Note that this is due to wear at the pivoting <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> <b>bushes,</b> not from actual stretching of the metal (as does happen to some flexible steel components such as the hand-brake cable of a motor vehicle).|$|E
40|$|In the paper, {{the design}} and {{operation}} of the planetary cycloidal transmission have been discussed. The transmission is a synthesis of the planetary and the straight-line mechanism. The planetary mechanism is made of a planetary gear set with rollers, which is critical for the proper work of the transmission. Its basic and most important element is the planetary cycloidal gear. Influence of the parameters determining the cycloidal profile of the gear on the gear’s geometry and the forces has been presented. The straight-line mechanism carrying the motion from the driving onto the driven unit of the transmission is made of the <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> <b>bushes</b> located in the holes of the planetary gears. The influence of the number and geometry of the elements on the forces and occuring in the holes of the planetary gears has been presented. Therefore, the properly defined geometry of the gear and of the material of which the gear is made is crucial for the safe operation of the planetary cycloidal transmission...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} the theoretical pressure distribution and loading capacity of the chain joints. The lubricating contact between <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> <b>bush</b> (<b>bush</b> chains) or <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> tooth cleat (silent chains) is modelled with Ocvirk’s short bearing solution which is based on the assumption that the contact surface between the two elements on width direction is significantly smaller than on length direction. This paper is presenting the steps to obtain the final the formula for pressure distribution. Numerical calculations are applied in the case of a bush chain. The loading capacity is calculated depending on lubricant thickness and speed in order to predict the type of lubrication that is present between the <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> <b>bush...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{statistical}} methodology of estimating wear coefficient and predicting wear volume in a revolute joint using in-situ measurement data is presented. An instrumented slider-crank mechanism is built, which can measure the joint {{force and the}} relative motion between the <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> <b>bushing</b> during operation. The former is measured using a load cell built onto a necked portion of the hollow steel pin, while the latter is measured using a capacitance probe. In order to isolate the effect of friction in other joints, a porous carbon air bearing for the revolute joint between the follower link and the slide stage, {{as well as a}} prismatic joint for the linear slide, are used. Based on the relative motion between the centers of <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> <b>bushing,</b> the wear volumes are estimated at six different operating cycles. The Bayesian inference technique is used to update the distribution of wear coefficient, which incorporates in-situ measurement data to obtain the posterior distribution. In order to obtain the posterior distribution, Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique is employed, which effectively draws samples of the given distribution. The results show {{that it is possible to}} narrow the distribution of wear coefficient and to predict the future wear volume with reasonable confidences. The effect of prior distribution on the wear coefficient is discussed by comparing with non-informative case...|$|R

50|$|The o-ring {{chain is}} named for the rubber o-rings built into {{the space between the}} outside link plate and the inside roller link plates. Chain {{manufacturers}} began to include this feature in 1971 after the application was invented by Joseph Montano while working for Whitney Chain of Hartford, Connecticut. O-rings were included as a way to improve lubrication to the links of power transmission chains, a service that is vitally important to extending their working life. These rubber fixtures form a barrier that holds factory applied lubricating grease inside the <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> <b>bushing</b> wear areas. Further, the rubber o-rings prevent dirt and other contaminants from entering the chain linkages, where such particles would otherwise cause significant wear.|$|R
50|$|Many driving chains (for example, in factory equipment, {{or driving}} a {{camshaft}} inside an internal combustion engine) operate in clean environments, {{and thus the}} wearing surfaces (that is, the <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> bushings) are safe from precipitation and airborne grit, many even in a sealed environment such as an oil bath. Some roller chains are designed to have o-rings built into {{the space between the}} outside link plate and the inside roller link plates.

40|$|Driving {{and timing}} chains {{are widely used}} machine {{elements}} which are continuously improved regarding wear and energy efficiency. Especially for timing chains, reducing wear is of high importance as the chain is critical for {{the function of the}} combustion engine. To achieve this goal, the wear within the chain joint has to be measured precisely which is usually done by measuring the length of the entire chain. With this measurement, no information about the distribution of wear between the contacting bodies, <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> <b>bush,</b> is available. An additional measuring and analyzing technique using a standard roundness instrument is developed with which more detailed information about the wear within the chain joint is obtained. With this new method, unworn chain joint components are characterized and the wear on worn components is measured <b>and</b> compared for <b>pins</b> with different surface treatments. Furthermore, approaches to use the measured data in simulation and calculation are presented. Keywords chain drives, wear measurement, roundness measurement, wear calculation...|$|R
40|$|Pin joints {{are found}} in many large {{articulating}} structures. They tend to be under high load and articulate slowly; so, the joints typically operate in the boundary or mixed lubrication regimes. This means that the operating torque depends on the respective proportions of liquid and solid contact between the joint mating faces. In this article, a mixed lubrication model of a grease-lubricated landing gear joint is established to determine a theoretical Stribeck curve, frictional torque and lubricant film thickness under different loads. Parameters describing pin joint working conditions, geometry, lubricant properties and pin/bush texture are used. The model can also predict {{the proportion of the}} load that is supported by contacting asperities and lubricant film. The changing proportions of these two parts indicate transformations between different lubrication regimes. Experiments on an instrumented pin joint have been carried out to compare with the predicted friction and torque performance. Theoretical calculation results show good consistency with experimental plots at high load. But under low load, the real friction between <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> <b>bush</b> is significantly lower than theoretical predictions. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} for modeling and simulating roller-chain drives using multibody formulations. The presented approach models the chain links as spatial decoupled dynamic bodies. The chain links are modeled using two different dynamic representations for the pin-link and the bushing-link. The bushing-link is modeled with two descendent dynamic bodies to represent the rollers. The adjacent <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> <b>bushing</b> links are connected by compliant bushing force elements. An efficient search algorithm is used to detect the contact between the roller and the sprocket teeth while a nonlinear force module is used to predict the contact force. A generalized sprocket representation is used to model the sprocket. The spatial motion of the chain links allows the out-of-plane vibrational motion of the links as well as simulating sprockets misalignment. Using the compliant connection between links avoids using the iterative calculation needed to satisfy the joint constraint equations leading to more efficient calculation scheme. The nonlinear dynamic equations of motion are solved using recursive approach. Complex roller chains drives, bicycle chain and conveyance systems can be easily modeled and analyzed using the proposed approach...|$|R

A new magazine release lever (available {{on both sides of}} the frame) was installed just beneath the trigger guard, which forced designers to modify both the pistol's frame and magazine.

5000|$|The {{lightweight}} {{chain of}} a bicycle with derailleur gears can snap (or rather, come {{apart at the}} side-plates, since it is normal for the [...] "riveting" [...] to fail first) because the pins inside are not cylindrical, they are barrel-shaped. Contact between the <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> the <b>bushing</b> is not the regular line, but a point which allows the chain's pins to work {{its way through the}} <b>bushing,</b> <b>and</b> finally the roller, ultimately causing the chain to snap. This form of construction is necessary because the gear-changing action of this form of transmission requires the chain to both bend sideways and to twist, but this can occur with the flexibility of such a narrow chain and relatively large free lengths on a bicycle.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Roller {{conveyor}} {{chains are}} commonly used to transport goods in production lines or assembly lines, such as pallets, cars or steel coils. They are sometimes used in severe environments, soiled with water, foreign particles, chemicals or other contaminants. Normal use will result in wear {{of the components of}} the chain which can lead to unexpected failure and costly production downtime. Today, few literatures on the wear of conveyor chain are available and there are almost no reliable test-rigs to generate and measure chain wear in a reproducible manner. In this paper the different components of roller conveyor chains are designed for sugar bucket elevator used in sugar industries for 20 tonnes per hour capacity and the loading conditions are described. Additionally, the advantages of chain drive as compared with other drives are discussed. The chain wear mechanisms found in literature are listed. Abrasive and adhesive wear between <b>pin,</b> <b>bushing,</b> <b>and</b> roller are also discussed...|$|R

50|$|As with {{standard}} roller chains, self-lubricating roller chains consist of five basic parts: inner plates, outer plates, <b>pins,</b> <b>bushes,</b> <b>and</b> rollers. However, the bushes for self-lubricating chains are sintered metal bushes. Sintered-metal self-lubricating bearings {{are based on}} powder-metallurgy technology. They are economical, suitable for high production rates and can be manufactured to precision tolerances.Specifically, alloyed powdered metal is mixed, then compacted to form the bushing. The initial compaction {{to a large degree}} dictates the density, shape, dimensions, and mechanical properties of the finished part.The bushings are then sintered.Sintered materials have inherent porosity and the presence of pores have both beneficial and detrimental role on the part performance. The pores act as stress concentration zones and reduce the mechanical strength and ductility. However, the presence of pores acts also contribute to the reduction in noise and vibration also serve as lubricant pockets in lubricated contacts. Sintered bearings and gears are also used in many applications where the external lubrication is not possible or not preferred.It is essential that the pores form an interconnected system of controlled size and volume, so that oil is supplied to the entire bearing surface. The rate of oil supply automatically increases with temperature and, therefore, with increasing speeds of rotation, to achieve optimum working conditions.|$|R
