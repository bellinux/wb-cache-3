Although this relatively intermediate error is acceptable for palaeoclimate reconstructions (Mosbrugger and Utescher 1997; Wilf et al. 1998), it also <b>pinpoints</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> of what causes this discrepancy for MAP.|$|R

The criticized practice of deriving stylized facts ad hoc is still quite prevalent in economics. Still, some possible approaches to derive stylized facts from empirical evidence have been suggested, such as surveying experts, statistically analysing large data sets (especially suitable for financial markets) or aggregating both qualitative and quantitative data from different empirical methods by following a systematic process.|$|R

We provide some evidence to suggest that this shift in perspectives is in fact necessary, and <b>pinpoint</b> <b>a</b> semantic <b>problem</b> that has not received sufficient attention in the past. We also propose <b>a</b> solution <b>to</b> this <b>problem,</b> by putting forward a new kind of steganography that employs human interactive proofs as a security primitive...|$|R

40|$|Going Noire is a single-player {{game where}} you are put into the shoes of a detective chasing a vicious killer around the globe by {{investigating}} each crime scene, finding clues that are hidden around the level and continuing on, one step behind the “underground killer” at all times. On finding every clue in the level the player will {{move on to the}} next level and be given a bit of insight into what the player character is thinking in between this transition. It’s difficult <b>to</b> <b>pinpoint</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> being addressed when speaking about games and it’s more about looking for something innovative and new in an ever growing industry, so my main goals with Going Noire were to create an interesting and different game that was most importantly fun to play. I chose to create Going Noire with a very stylised art style, with mostly dark colours and shades used on the levels with vibrant colours standing out more. Although Going Noire is a first-person game it is not a shooter, as I didn’t want to make a generic FPS (first-person shooter), which the gaming market is saturated with, and I would consider it more a puzzle game disguised as a first-person style game as FPS is a very popular genre in gaming today. The project was developed using the Unity 3 D game engine, with coding and scripts created using Microsoft Visual Studio, which is integrated with Unity. All models and objects for the game were created by me using Maya, a 3 D animation and modelling software...|$|R
