25|$|To work in {{the nursing}} profession, all nurses hold one or more {{credentials}} depending on their scope of practice and education. A licensed <b>practical</b> <b>nurse</b> (LPN) (also {{referred to as a}} licensed vocational nurse, registered <b>practical</b> <b>nurse,</b> enrolled nurse, and state enrolled nurse) works independently or with a registered nurse (RN). The most significant differentiation between an LPN and RN is found in the requirements for entry to practice, which determines entitlement for their scope of practice. For example, Canada requires a bachelor's degree for the RN and a two-year diploma for the LPN. A registered nurse provides scientific, psychological, and technological knowledge in the care of patients and families in many health care settings. Registered nurses may earn additional credentials or degrees.|$|E

Trouten's mother received several typed letters signed by her daughter and purportedly mailed while the couple was abroad, although the envelopes all bore Kansas City postmarks. The letters were, her mother said, uncharacteristically mistake-free. Later, Robinson told Trouten's mother that she had run off with an acquaintance after stealing money from him.|$|E
500|$|Monk's phobias {{and anxiety}} {{disorders}} make him depend on personal assistants, who drive him around, do his shopping, and always carry {{a supply of}} wipes for his use, as shown in episodes like [...] "Mr. Monk Meets the Playboy", [...] "Mr. Monk Goes to the Carnival", etc. They also {{take an active role}} in organizing his consultancy work, and sometimes investigate cases themselves. His first assistant, Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram), is a single mother and <b>practical</b> <b>nurse</b> by profession, hired by the police department to help Monk recover from the three-year catatonic state he lapsed into after Trudy's death. After several years of loyal service, Sharona leaves the show in season 3 to return to New Jersey and remarry her ex-husband Trevor. After her abrupt departure, Monk has a chance meeting with Natalie Teeger (Traylor Howard), whom he hires as his new assistant starting in [...] "Mr. Monk and the Red Herring".|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} the practical/vocational nurse {{can be traced back}} to the {{practice}} of self-taught individuals who worked in home care in the past, assisting with basic care (ADLs such as bathing) and light housekeeping duties (such as cooking). Licensing standards for <b>practical</b> <b>nurses</b> came later than those for professional nurses; by 1945, 19 states and one territory had licensure laws, but only one state law covered <b>practical</b> <b>nursing.</b> By 1955, however, every state had licensing laws for <b>practical</b> <b>nurses.</b> <b>Practical</b> <b>nurses</b> who had been functioning as such at the time new standards were adopted usually granted a license by waiver, and exempt from new training requirements.|$|R

40|$|Research {{utilization}} {{is becoming}} increasingly important in nursing programs, especially since sound clinical nursing practice {{must be based on}} evidence-based nursing. In this study, research was incorporated into a 2 -year <b>practical</b> <b>nursing</b> diploma program at the College level. No formal method exists within the <b>practical</b> <b>nursing</b> program to implement research and therefore a paradigm similar to the undergraduate research programs present in universities was employed. Student selection was based on faculty consensus and a project spanning 2 semesters was selected. Faculty met with the student approximately once a month and the student indicated satisfaction with the way the research program was integrated within the <b>practical</b> <b>nursing</b> program. To provide motivation for students in the <b>practical</b> <b>nursing</b> program at Sheridan College to participate in the research component, a record of the participation can be made on the student’s curricular record at the College. Other ways research can be incorporated into college-level <b>practical</b> <b>nursing</b> programs include the incremental introduction of research into specific courses within the program or provision a credited research course. A structured blueprint is provided to aid college-level health programs incorporate research into their curricula...|$|R
