5|$|As Kenta Cho usually {{releases}} the source code of his games under a BSD-like <b>permissive</b> license, his games are often ported by volunteers to other systems. For example, Tumiki Fighters written in D and released in 2004, {{was included in}} the Linux distribution Debian and also ported to Pandora handheld.|$|E
5|$|Reasons for the {{decision}} not to publish the cartoons widely in the United Statesdespite that country's <b>permissive</b> free speech lawsincluded increased religious sensitivity, higher integration of Muslims into mainstream society, and a desire to be tactful considering the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|FreeBSD has {{similarities}} with Linux, {{with two}} major differences {{in scope and}} licensing: FreeBSD maintains a complete operating system, i.e. the project delivers kernel, device drivers, userland utilities and documentation, as opposed to Linux delivering a kernel and drivers only and relying on third-parties for system software; and FreeBSD source code is generally released under a <b>permissive</b> BSD license {{as opposed to the}} copyleft GPL used by Linux.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 another Parliamentary select {{committee}} recommended the compulsory {{adoption of the}} metric system after a two-year <b>permissive</b> period. The 1897 Weights and Measures Act legalised the metric units for trade, but did not make them mandatory. A bill to make the metric system compulsory in order to enable the British industrial base to fight off {{the challenge of the}} nascent German base passed through the House of Lords in 1904, but did not pass in the House of Commons before the next general election was called. Following opposition by the Lancashire cotton industry, a similar bill was defeated in 1907 in the House of Commons by 150 votes to 118.|$|E
5|$|Parsons was {{immediately}} fired from Hughes; the FBI investigated the complaint and were suspicious that Parsons was spying for the Israeli government. Parsons denied the allegations when interrogated; {{he insisted that}} his intentions were peaceful {{and that he had}} suffered an error of judgment in procuring the documents. Some of Parsons' scientific colleagues rallied to his defense, but the case against him worsened when the FBI investigated Rosenfeld for being linked to Soviet agents, and more accounts of his occult and sexually <b>permissive</b> activities at the Parsonage came to light. In October 1951 the U.S. attorney decided that because the contents of the reports did not constitute state secrets, Parsons was not guilty of espionage.|$|E
5|$|The FreeBSD project {{includes}} a security team overseeing all software shipped {{in the base}} distribution. A wide range of additional third-party applications may be installed using the pkgng package management system or the FreeBSD Ports, or by directly compiling source code. Due to its <b>permissive</b> licensing terms, much of FreeBSD's code base has {{become an integral part}} of other operating systems, such as Juniper JUNOS, Apple's Darwin (which is the base for macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS operating systems by Apple), the Nintendo Switch system software, and the operating systems running on Sony's PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, the Box Office Attractions {{name was}} replaced with the newly incorporated Fox Film Corporation. Edwards remained one of the studio's most important directors and one of William Fox's closest advisers. He became known for his epic filmmaking and for a <b>permissive</b> approach to directing his starring cast, an attitude that led Bara's biographer to compare him to Alfred Hitchcock. Often, that cast included Bara, whose films with him include Under Two Flags (1916), the epic historical drama Cleopatra (1917), and A Woman There Was (1919).|$|E
5|$|The <b>permissive</b> {{attitude}} toward business {{did not always}} extend toward large corporations. A lack of venture capital in the state became a significant problem with the early industry. Civic and business leaders, and even ordinary citizens, worried that the influx of capital from outside the state {{would lead to a}} loss of political power, revenue, and business opportunities. This sentiment led to a series of antitrust lawsuits by the state Attorney General starting in 1906. The lawsuits easily succeeded and limited the ability of outside investors, most notably Standard Oil, to gain control of the state oil companies.|$|E
5|$|Version 2002 was {{announced}} August 28, 2001. The Family Edition was dropped, so parental controls and information filtering are bundled with this release. The installation was noted as quick and simple by both PC Magazine and CNET. An installation requires a reboot, and afterwards the Security Assistant guides users through a questionnaire to best configure the settings. A problem CNET encountered when upgrading from the prior release was {{the loss of}} customized settings. PC Magazine found the default settings, aimed at avoiding frequent notifications, were somewhat <b>permissive.</b> Windows 95 support was also dropped.|$|E
5|$|Governmental Regulation No. 493/2002 Coll. {{divides the}} listed {{illnesses}} and handicaps into four groups, covering various issues from psychological and psychiatrical to eyesight and hearing (for example, the applicant {{must be able}} to hear casual speech over distance of 6 meters to be cleared for the E category). Generally, the regulation is more <b>permissive</b> {{when it comes to the}} license categories A and B, and more strict with view to the other categories, listing which illnesses and handicaps may curtail or outright prevent positive clearance by the general practitioner. The outcome of the medical examination may be either full clearance, denial, or conditional clearance that lists obligatory health accessories (glasses, hearing aid, etc.) or sets obligatory escort when armed (e.g. B – sport shooters with minor psychological issues, or with addiction habits cured more than three years prior to the health check).|$|E
5|$|In many European {{countries}} (e.g., Britain, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland) {{the risk}} or dose limit for {{a member of}} the public exposed to radiation from a future high-level nuclear waste facility is considerably more stringent than that suggested by the International Commission on Radiation Protection or proposed in the United States. European limits are often more stringent than the standard suggested in 1990 by the International Commission on Radiation Protection by a factor of 20, and more stringent by a factor of ten than the standard proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository for the first 10,000 years after closure. Moreover, the U.S. EPA’s proposed standard for greater than 10,000 years is 250 times more <b>permissive</b> than the European limit.|$|E
5|$|Many viruses can be {{synthesised}} de novo ("from scratch") and {{the first}} synthetic virus was created in 2002. Although somewhat of a misconception, {{it is not the}} actual virus that is synthesised, but rather its DNA genome (in case of a DNA virus), or a cDNA copy of its genome (in case of RNA viruses). For many virus families the naked synthetic DNA or RNA (once enzymatically converted back from the synthetic cDNA) is infectious when introduced into a cell. That is, they contain all the necessary information to produce new viruses. This technology is now being used to investigate novel vaccine strategies. The ability to synthesise viruses has far-reaching consequences, since viruses can no longer be regarded as extinct, as long as the information of their genome sequence is known and <b>permissive</b> cells are available. , the full-length genome sequences of 3843 different viruses, including smallpox, are publicly available in an online database maintained by the National Institutes of Health.|$|E
5|$|Helen {{went away}} for a period in June 1941, during which Parsons, {{encouraged}} {{to do so by}} the sexually <b>permissive</b> attitude of the O.T.O., began a sexual relationship with her 17-year-old sister, Sara. Upon Helen's return, Sara asserted that she was Parsons' new wife, and Parsons himself admitted that he found Sara more sexually attractive than Helen. Conflicted in her feelings, Helen sought comfort in Smith and began a relationship with him that lasted {{for the rest of his}} life; the four remained friends. The two couples, along with a number of other Thelemites (some of whom with their children), moved to 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue, an American Craftsman-style mansion. They all contributed to the rent of $100 a month and lived communally in what replaced Winona Boulevard as the new base of the Agape Lodge, maintaining an allotment and slaughtering their own livestock for meat as well as blood rituals. Parsons decorated his new room with a copy of the Stele of Revealing, a statue of Pan, and his collection of swords and daggers. He converted the garage and laundry room into a chemical laboratory and often held science fiction discussion meetings in the kitchen, and entertained the children with hunts for fairies in the 25-acre garden.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{wanted to}} get rid of Goodell, a Republican who had been {{appointed}} by Governor Rockefeller after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, and who had shifted considerably to the left while in office. Goodell could be sacrificed as there was a Conservative Party candidate, James Buckley, who might win the seat. Nixon did not want to be seen as engineering the defeat of a fellow Republican, and did not have Agnew go to New York until after Nixon left on a European trip, hoping Agnew would be perceived as acting on his own. After dueling long-distance with Goodell over the report of the Scranton Commission on campus violence (Agnew considered it too <b>permissive),</b> Agnew gave a speech in New York in which, without naming names, he made it clear he supported Buckley. That Nixon was behind the machinations did not remain secret long, as both Agnew and Nixon adviser Murray Chotiner disclosed it; Goodell stated he still believed he had Nixon's support. Although it was by then deemed unlikely the Republicans could gain control of the Senate, both Nixon and Agnew went on the campaign trail for the final days before the election. The outcome was disappointing: Republicans gained only two seats in the Senate, and lost eleven governorships. For Agnew, one bright spot was Goodell's defeat by Buckley in New York, but he was disappointed when his former chief of staff, Charles Blair, failed to unseat Governor Marvin Mandel, Agnew's successor and a Democrat, in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|The Basingstoke Canal {{started at}} a canal basin, roughly where the cinema in Festival Place is located. From there the canal ran {{alongside}} the River Loddon following {{the line of}} Eastrop Way. The old canal route passes under the perimeter ring road and then follows a long loop partly on an embankment to pass over small streams and water meadows towards Old Basing, where the route goes around the now ruined palace of Basing House and then through and around {{the eastern edge of}} Old Basing. It followed another loop to go over small streams near the Hatch public house (a lot of this section was built over when constructing the M3) and headed across fields on an embankment towards Mapledurwell. The section of the canal from Up Nately to the western entrance of the Greywell Tunnel still exists and is a nature reserve; there is water in the canal and the canal towpath can be walked. A <b>permissive</b> footpath at the western entrance to the tunnel allows walkers to access public footpaths to get to the eastern entrance of the tunnel. The limit of navigation is about 500m east of the Greywell Tunnel. The renovated sections of the canal can then be navigated east towards West Byfleet where it joins the Wey Navigation, which itself can be navigated to the River Thames at Weybridge.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the above steps to reduce {{the probability of a}} nuclear detonation arising from a single fault, locking mechanisms referred to by NATO states as <b>Permissive</b> Action Links are sometimes attached to the control mechanisms for nuclear warheads. <b>Permissive</b> Action Links act solely to prevent the unauthorised use of a nuclear weapon.|$|E

25|$|The {{official}} reference {{implementation of the}} PNG format is the programming library libpng. It is published as free software {{under the terms of}} a <b>permissive</b> free software licence. Therefore, it is usually found as an important system library in free operating systems.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{although}} the Turkish capitulations {{were not in}} themselves treaties, yet by subsequent confirmation they acquired the force of commercial durable instead of personal nature; the conversion of <b>permissive</b> into perfect rights; questions as to contraband and neutral trade stated in definite terms.|$|E
25|$|The {{diversity}} of Linux distributions {{is due to}} technical, organizational, and philosophical variation among vendors and users. The <b>permissive</b> licensing of free software means that any user with sufficient knowledge and interest can customize an existing distribution or design one to suit {{his or her own}} needs.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{discussion}} of whether some recent trends towards more revealing clothing and <b>permissive</b> habits {{have created a}} more sexualized general environment, in which some forms of communication are unfairly labeled harassment, but are simply a reaction to greater sexualization in everyday environments.|$|E
25|$|On October 20, 2011 the California Public Utilities Commission {{confirmed}} implementing 669 as an overlay to {{the existing}} 408 area code, {{the first in the}} San Francisco Bay Area. The new area code became active in November 2012, following a six-month <b>permissive</b> dialing period.|$|E
25|$|This day Boycott {{was not so}} <b>permissive</b> and his innings {{shone like}} a {{sapphire}} in the sun.

25|$|Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, a {{vast number}} of species were tested for the ability to shed oocysts upon infection. Whereas at least 17 {{different}} species of felids have been confirmed to shed oocysts, no nonfelid {{has been shown to be}} <b>permissive</b> for T. gondii sexual reproduction and subsequent oocyst shedding.|$|E
25|$|Gay travel {{destinations}} {{are popular}} among practitioners of gay tourism because they usually have <b>permissive</b> or liberal attitudes towards gays, feature a prominent gay infrastructure (bars, businesses, restaurants, hotels, nightlife, entertainment, media, organisations, etc.), {{the opportunity to}} socialize with other gays, and the feeling that one can relax safely among other gay people.|$|E
25|$|Nyíri's {{proposition}} {{was immediately}} criticised by Ottó Gyürk, {{pointing to the}} fact that with such a <b>permissive</b> deciphering method one can get anything out of the code. Also, the mere fact that Nyíri makes an uncritical allusion to the fringe theory that the Hungarian language descended from Sumerian, discredits his enterprise.|$|E
25|$|With a large German {{immigrant}} {{population and the}} development of a brewing industry, Missouri always has had among the most <b>permissive</b> alcohol laws in the United States. It never enacted statewide prohibition. Missouri voters rejected prohibition in three separate referenda in 1910, 1912, and 1918. Alcohol regulation did not begin in Missouri until 1934.|$|E
25|$|Agar plates may be {{formulated}} {{as either}} <b>permissive,</b> {{with the intent}} of allowing the growth of whatever organisms are present, or restrictive or selective, {{with the intent of}} only allowing growth a particular subset of those organisms. This may {{take the form of a}} nutritional requirement, for instance providing a particular compound such as lactose as the only source of carbon and thereby selecting only organisms which can metabolize that compound, or by including a particular antibiotic or other substance to select only organisms which are resistant to that substance. This correlates to some degree with defined and undefined media; undefined media, made from natural products and containing an unknown combination of very many organic molecules, is typically more <b>permissive</b> in terms of supplying the needs of a wider variety of organisms, while defined media can be precisely tailored to select organisms with specific properties.|$|E
25|$|In 1983 {{her father}} {{sent her to}} Newtown School, an {{exclusive}} Quaker boarding school in Waterford, an institution with a much more <b>permissive</b> atmosphere than Grianan. With the help and encouragement of her Irish language teacher, Joseph Falvey, she recorded a four-song demo, with two covers and two of her own songs which later appeared on her first album.|$|E
25|$|When area codes were {{introduced}} in 1947 San Jose was assigned to area code 415 {{along with the rest}} of the San Francisco Bay Area and much of northern California. Area code 408 was created on January 1, 1959, and included most of Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Monterey and San Benito Counties. Until the late 1970s, there was <b>permissive</b> dialing between (408) and (415). At the time, the entire East Bay, peninsula, and on to Marin County was in area code (415). Phone numbers were not duplicated across (415) and (408), so subscribers could dial seven-digit San Francisco or Berkeley numbers without dialing an area code and the call would go through. Population growth, facsimile machines, and pagers caused demands for numbers to outrun the capacity of this <b>permissive</b> dialing plan. The additional demands for PCS and cellular phone numbers helped necessitate the (831)/(408) area code split, the (650)/(415) split, and the earlier (510)/(415) split.|$|E
