Farmers grew rice, vegetables and pineapples, while fishermen lived in huts connected by plank walkways in the small harbour of Tsing Yi Tong which stretched far back into the island. Many fishermen also lived on their junks and boats all the time, fishing in the nearby waters. Even {{as late as the}} 1970s, Tsing Yi Tong resembled Tai O with its characteristic stilt houses and water vehicles. Like many other fishing villages in Hong Kong, the Tsing Yi dwellers worshipped Tin Hau, the goddess of mercy and the sea. A Tin Hau Temple was built on the shore of Tsing Yi Tong.

500|$|..... And when Michel {{gets his}} strokes of genius and, {{in the video}} for [...] "Army of Me", wants a dentist that's a gorilla to find a diamond in my mouth, some <b>people</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> nonsense. But it's {{probably}} the most realistic way of expressing what situation I'm in - all these people trying to take things away from me, and the gorilla finding a diamond that I don't know I have and then stealing it. [...] "Army of Me" [...] is so much about me actually learning that I have to defend myself. I {{have to stand up}} and fight the fucking gorilla. Once I've got the diamond and I run away with it, it becomes massive 'cos it's mine. But if the gorilla had kept it, it would have gone really tiny. That's surrealism for me.|$|E
500|$|Along with Knocked Up and Waitress, {{two other}} 2007 films about women facing {{unplanned}} pregnancies, Juno was interpreted by some critics {{as having a}} pro-life theme. Ann Hulbert of Slate magazine believed that Juno [...] " [...] both pro-life and pro-choice purism." [...] Jeff Dawson of The Sunday Times believed that the film was inevitably placed in the [...] "unwanted pregnancy subgenre" [...] with Knocked Up and Waitress due to its subject matter but thought that its interpretation as a pro-life film only [...] "muddied the waters".

[...] A. O. Scott, writing for The New York Times, agreed that Juno has [...] "an underlying theme, a message that is not anti-abortion but rather pro-adulthood." [...] Ellen Page commented, [...] "What I get most frustrated at is when <b>people</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a pro-life movie, which is just absurd... The {{most important thing is}} the choice is there, and the film completely demonstrates that." [...] Cody and Page have openly stated that they are pro-choice; Reitman thought that it was [...] "fantastic" [...] that pro-life and pro-choice groups were embracing the film.
