50|$|In 1985, The Great Northern Telegraph Company {{changed its}} name to GN Store Nord (GN = Great Nordic) with the aim of {{creating}} a new group identity and organizing its businesses. In this process, all subsidiaries were renamed to include GN: GN Danavox, GN NetTest, GN Automatic etc. A major change happened in 1991 when GN was assigned the attractive GMS concession from the national Danish telecommunication authorities. In March 1992, GN's new subsidiary Sonofon opened the first <b>private</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> network in Denmark. Although GN was not the only investor in Sonofon, it owned the majority of the shares. With the blossoming of the data communications and telephony industry, and a charismatic CEO Jørgen Lindegaard, GN was back on track and enjoyed massive success in the late 1990s. In 2000, the company sold Sonofon to Norwegian telecom operator Telenor for a price of DKK 14,7 billion. A large amount was invested in the GN subsidiary NetTest, which had evolved from the former Elmi and considered GN’s prospective core business. It was decided to let NetTest acquire the French company Photonetics for a price of DKK 9,1 billion. The optimistic view of the future was also reflected in the share price which had increased fivefold in only one year from September 1, 1999 to September 1, 2000. The focus and investment in NetTest, however, resulted in a serious downturn since GN had misjudged the market development of NetTest’s products. In 2001, net profit ended at DKK -9,2 billion followed by a share price decline equivalent to previous years’ gains. Thereby major parts of the yield from Sonofon was lost within one year, and shareholders were raging in the media and at the annual general meeting.|$|E

It analyses how <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> usage affects relationships between respondents by comparing models of the cause-effect relationship of several latent factors in different environments, namely dependency on <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> communication, perception of friendships, individual factors and IT literacy. By applying a covariance structure analysis, the correlations between latent and observable variables can be successfully visualized.

Method The 2010 Irish Contraception and Crisis Pregnancy Survey (ICCP- 2010) is a nationally representative sample of adults aged 18 - 45 years living in Ireland (n = 3002; 1416 recruited by landline telephone and 1586 recruited by <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone).</b> The overall response rate for the survey was 69 % (79 % for the landline telephone strand; 61 % for the <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> strand). All interviews were conducted using computer-assisting telephone interviewing. Results During the 18 -week fieldwork period, five main challenges relating to the use of <b>mobile</b> <b>telephones</b> were encountered: (1) explaining to respondents how random digit dialling works in relation to mobile telephones; (2) establishing the respondent's eligibility; (3) calling the respondent with the Caller ID blocked or withheld; (4) calling the respondent when they are in any number of locations or situations; and (5) explaining to respondents the importance of refusal conversion calls for the response rate calculation. Details of how the survey protocols and procedures were monitored and adapted throughout the study to ensure a high response rate are outlined. Conclusion It is undeniably more challenging to recruit respondents using <b>mobile</b> <b>telephones</b> as opposed to landline telephones. Respondents are generally not familiar with being contacted on their personal <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> for the purposes of being recruited for a research study. The main challenge for survey methodologists and interviewers is to devise simple protocols to explain to respondents why they are being contacted on a <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone.</b> Recommendations for survey researchers interested in using this methodological approach in the future are discussed. </p...|$|R
