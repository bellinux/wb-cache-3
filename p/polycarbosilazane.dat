40|$|The {{pyrolysis}} of cross-linked poly(hydridomethyl) silazane pellets via transient isothermal {{ammonia gas}} treatment yields amorphous layered ceramic bulk Si/N-Si/N/C-materials with graded carbon content. By this process the C {{content in the}} material can be adjusted with high accuracy in the range between 0 and 14 wt. %. The influence of (1) temperature of reactive ammonia treatment (2) time of reactive isothermal ammonia treatment (3) isothermal holding time under inert atmosphere (Ar) before application of ammonia (4) degree of cross-linking of the <b>polycarbosilazane</b> (5) porosity of green compact (6) volume ratio of NH 3 in the reactive atmosphere was examined. The temperature of 525 ºC and the reactive atmosphere containing 10 vol. % NH 3 {{were found to be}} optimum for carbon content adjustment. Higher ammonia contents did not allow suitable control of the process, while higher temperature of transient heat treatment caused crack formation in the specimen due to excessive pressure of gaseous reaction products. High degree of cross-linking as well as the annealing of cross-linked green bodies at transient temperature in inert atmosphere decrease the efficiency of the reactive treatment and increase the ratio of C built in the pre-ceramic continuous random network (CRN). Next to graded materials, samples with bulk homogeneous carbon distribution were generated. However, these require more sophisticated heating schedules and combination of reactive treatment with pre-annealing in inert gas...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{reported}} research is to develop and characterize chemical processes leading to the fabrication of high temperature structural materials which experience temperatures above 1000 °C. Ceramic based materials are chosen due to high melting points and potentially greater then-no-mechanical stability compared with metals. Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMCs) represent a significant improvement in toughness over monolithic type ceramics which allows for their incorporation as structural materials. The synthesis of multiphase material systems was investigated to exploit synergistic enhancement which composite like materials exhibit, especially non-brittle mechanical behavior as ceramic components. ^ Three specific areas of study will be discussed: Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) of ceramic interface coatings, ceramic preform and pre-ceramic polymer synthesis for composite processing, and environmental/thermal barrier coatings for oxide and non-oxide substrates. Processing of boron nitride-silicon nitride coatings for SiC based ceramic fibers was studied to identify deposition parameters, microstructure and the resultant composite properties utilizing the coatings in as-received and in wet oxidative conditions above 1000 °C. The second area concerns the development and characterization of composites utilizing novel, low cost ceramic preforms and a synthesized <b>polycarbosilazane</b> pre-ceramic polymer compared with commercially available material systems. 2 -D 8 ply laminate CMCs via a modified Polymer Impregnation and Pyrolysis (PIP) method were investigated. Commercially available fibers based on SiC were used including Nicalon™ and Tyranno™. Analysis from the first section involving interface coatings {{was applied to the}} CMC processing. The third area of consideration is the CVD deposition of refractory/transition metal silicides and oxides of MoSi 2 /Al 2 O 3 as barrier coatings for the advanced protection of the metal and non-oxide CMCs substrates. Conditions for the atmospheric pressure deposition of the bi-layer coating are discussed. Total CMC fabrications and the impact of the individual component processing developed in this research will be compared to currently available systems for efficacy of the discussed fabrication routes. ...|$|E
40|$|Poly(methylsilane) (PMS) {{has been}} used as a {{precursor}} to form a variety of ceramic materials within the Si-C-N system. Special emphasis was placed on the synthesis of SiC, $ rm Si sb 3 N sb 4 $ and derived tertiary ceramic materials for use in semiconductor applications, mainly as thin films coated onto various substrates. Detailed insight into the chemical transformations occurring during pyrolysis under inert (N$ sb 2 $, Ar) or reactive (NH$ sb 3 $) atmospheres was achieved by analysis of the layers coated on silicon single-crystal wafers. The oxidation of PMS and its transformation during pyrolysis into SiC were monitored by IR reflectance and transmission spectroscopy. The degree of the oxidation of PMS is not only a critical factor in determining the electronic properties of the final resulting materials, but is also a key factor in determining the pyrolysis mechanism. An important observation was the low-temperature ($ sim$ 200 $ sp circ$C) Kumada rearrangement of the PMS to poly(cabosilane) (PCS). This reaction was evident at 200 $ sp circ$C on silicon substrates, when the oxygen concentration in PMS was below 40 parts per million (ppm). Ultrathin layers of amorphous SiC (a-SiC) with thicknesses of $ sim$ 100 nm were obtained by deposition of the volatile species resulting from the thermal cracking of the precursor. The cracked-polymer vapor deposition (CP-VD) method allowed the synthesis of smooth (mirror-like) ceramic layers. The layers obtained by both CP-VD and spin-coating procedures exhibited resistivities in the range of $ 10 sp 3 - 10 sp 6 Omega$ cm and good adhesion properties onto the silicon substrates. n-type SiC layers doped with nitrogen having a resistivity range suitable for Si/SiC heterojunctions in solar cells were also synthesized on silicon single-crystal wafers. A homogeneous doping procedure was developed that consists of reacting the Wurtz PMS prepolymer with NH$ sb 3 $ to form a "doping polymer". Partial pressure of NH$ sb 3 $ can enhance the rate of deposition of ceramics on cold substrates. In this case, CP-VD appears to combine some advantages of the two currently used procedures for growing thin films [...] i. e., a high deposition rate characteristic of pyrolysis of spin-coated films of precursors and good texture of the layers, characteristic of the chemical vapor deposition process (CVD). The inclusion of higher concentrations of nitrogen into the ceramic material was studied during the synthesis of $ rm Si sb 3 N sb 4 $ by pyrolysis of PMS under pure NH$ sb 3 $. The analysis of the intermediate products resulting from the reaction of the precursor with NH$ sb 3 $ revealed that carbon loss occurred at temperatures below 600 $ sp circ$C, and involves <b>poly(carbosilazane)</b> species. The stoichiometric 4 : 3 atomic ratio of N to Si is achieved below 500 $ sp circ$C. A reaction path way is proposed in which only heterodehydrocoupling between Si-H and N-H groups occurs. This pathway is sufficient to explain the incorporation of excess nitrogen (compared to $ rm Si sb 3 N sb 4 $) usually observed in the intermediate pyrolysis products. Carbon loss is not directly related to nitrogen incorporation, thus the two processes are, at least partially, independent. The effect of the thermal decomposition of NH$ sb 3 $, as an independent variable, on the carbon/nitrogen exchange process was studied. Deviations from thermodynamic equilibrium were related to dynamic conditions characterizing the flow regime...|$|E
