In both types of sample the most common item was insects (Isoptera e Hymenoptera) and, in less quantity, plant fragments and orhers invertebrates (Aranae, Blattaria, Coleoptera, Diplopoda, Scorpiones).

40|$|Abstract The last {{assessment}} of the conservation status of mammals in Paraguay took place in 2006 and found just two species of Xenarthra, Myrmecophaga tridactyla and <b>Priodontes</b> <b>maximus,</b> to be threatened at the national level. Though seriously outdated in a rapidly-changing landscape, this assessment continues to be used today {{as a tool for}} national wildlife management decisions. This paper highlights difficulties in the current national assessment process, and suggests solutions with the aim of producing a more accurate reflection of the conservation status of Paraguayan xenarthrans during the next review. The provision to reviewers of regularly updated “crash-courses ” in the current issues affecting the conservation of xenar-thrans in Paraguay is suggested as a useful tool in reaching this aim, and a revision of the main factors that reviewers should be considering at the time of writing is provided here for each of the Paraguayan species...|$|R
40|$|Large and {{medium-sized}} mammals {{are essential to}} forest ecosystems as {{they are responsible for}} prey population control, seed dispersal and predation. A mammal survey was conducted in the Humaitá Forest Reserve (HFR), a 20 km² forest fragment located in the southeastern part of the state. The survey was carried out using census transects, camera traps, and occasional records such as bones and footprints. In all, 27 species of large to medium-sized mammals were recorded for the RFH, representing 48 % of those expected for the region. Dasyprocta fuliginosa, Pecari tajacu and Didelphis marsupialis were the species with the highest number of records with camera traps. The occurrence of two species of cats (Leopardus pardalis and Puma concolor) and three endangered species (Callimico goeldii, Myrmecophaga tridactyla and <b>Priodontes</b> <b>maximus)</b> are important records for the RFH. The results may aid future research on the ecology, biogeography and conservation of mammals in the region...|$|R
40|$|We report 20 {{records of}} <b>Priodontes</b> <b>maximus</b> (Kerr, 1792) {{collected}} between 1990 and 2009 in three nature reserves located in forested areas of southeastern Brazil within the Atlantic Forest biome. Seventeen records {{were collected in}} Parque Estadual do Rio Doce (PERD), state of Minas Gerais, two in Reserva Biológica de Sooretama and one in Reserva Natural Vale, both located {{in the state of}} Espírito Santo. The records were burrows (n = 11), photographs from camera-traps (n = 6), sightings (n = 2) and carcass (n = 1). Given the higher number of records, the PERD seems to maintain the largest population among the three study areas. We searched the literature and found no other recent evidence of the species' presence in the Atlantic forest of Brazil. There are few Museum specimens and a general lack of information on the presence of the species in this biome as a whole. These facts suggest that the conservation status of the giant armadillo is extremely critical in the Atlantic Forest...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} impact of two wildfires,, in 1994 and 1995, on the large mammal fauna of Emas National Park, central Brazil. The 1994 fire burned 100 per cent of the park's {{grassland}} and after the fire, in a c. 2000 -ha survey area, the authors found 16 giant anteaters Myrmecophaga tridactyla, two giant armadillos. <b>Priodontes</b> <b>maximus</b> and one tapir Tapirus terrestris that {{had died in the}} fire. The 1995 fire burned 15 per cent of the park's grassland and no dead animals were found in a 220 -ha survey area. The authors discuss the possible long-term ecological consequences of wildfires on the large mammal fauna of Emas, with a special focus on the giant anteater population, which is particularly susceptible to fires. They recommend a fire management programme, which would include controlled bums on a rotational basis in different sections of the park [...] : The programme would also improve the availability of food for herbivores and control the spread of alien grass species...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Knowledge about fauna {{location}} and distribution {{is very important}} for animal biology understanding. Conservation Units are relevant to biodiversity when considering factors such as hunting, agricultural expansion and forest fires. The conservation of native vegetation fragments under more suitable management plans, recovery areas and surveys are essential to the mammals preservation. This study aimed to survey the mammals of medium and large size of the Brasilia National Forest Area 1. To carry out this study it was performed weekly rounds in search for direct and indirect mammals traces existing at forest reserve. It is reported the presence of 27 species in the study area. According to the IUCN Red List, four species are vulnerable to extinction: tapir (Tapirus terrestris), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), giant armadillo (<b>Priodontes</b> <b>maximus)</b> and oncilla (Leopardus guttulus). Two species were recorded nearly threatened species: maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) and pampas deer (Ozotocerus bezoarticus). Also according to the same list, 48 % (n= 13) of species are declining in population trend and 26 % (n= 7) for this data is unknown. Differences in the area were observed, with mammal species presence associated to Cerrado vegetation types and in distribution of records over the period...|$|R
40|$|The {{consumption}} of hunting animals is of fundamental importance for human subsistence in different tropical areas. Knowing the chosen species, {{the techniques of}} capture and the quantity are fundamental aspects {{to understand how to}} use and the degree of threat of hunting on each wild species. In this perspective, the objective of this work was to record the wild animal species most commonly used as food resource in five rural settlements in the municipality of Uruará-PA, in addition to qualify the main techniques of capturing these species. The data collection was made through semi-structured interviews and participant observation. For the selection of the interviewees, we adopted the “snowball” method. As a result, we identified 38 species of animals consumed, most being mammals (42. 1 %), followed by birds (39. 4 %) and reptiles (18. 5 %). The species most frequently mentioned were: Cuniculus paca (n= 156), Euphractus sexcinctus (n= 154) and Pecari tajacu (n= 137). The most used technique was hunting with shotgun. Among the animals cited, <b>Priodontes</b> <b>maximus,</b> Tayassu pecari, Tapirus terrestris, Myrmecophaga tridactyla, Podocnemis unifilis, Tinamus tao, Crax fasciolata and Podocnemis unifilis are in the list of threatened species. The results point to the urgent need for educational programs to farmers regarding the unsustainable use of animals...|$|R
40|$|Standard line-transect census {{techniques}} were deployed {{to generate a}} checklist and quantify the abundance of medium and large-bodied vertebrate species in forest areas of eastern Amazonia with and without a history of reduced-impact logging (RIL). Three areas were allocated a total of 1, 196. 9 km of line-transect census effort. Sampling was conducted from April to June 2012 and from April to August 2013, and detected 29 forest vertebrate species considered in this study belonging to 15 orders, 20 families and 28 genera. Additionally, eight species were recorded outside census walks through direct and indirect observations. Of this total, six species are considered vulnerable according to IUCN (Ateles paniscus, Myrmecophaga tridactyla, <b>Priodontes</b> <b>maximus,</b> Tapirus terrestris, Tayassu peccary, Chelonoidis denticulata). Observed species richness ranged from 21 to 24 species in logged and unlogged areas, and encounter rates along transects were highly variable between treatments. However, the relative abundance of species per transect did not differ between transects in logged and unlogged forests. Of the species detected during censuses, only three showed different relative abundance between the two treatments (Saguinus midas, Tinamus spp. and Dasyprocta leporina). Our {{results show that the}} effect of RIL forest management was a relatively unimportant determinant of population abundance for most medium and large vertebrates over the time period of the survey...|$|R
