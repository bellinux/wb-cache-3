The majority of BI research has been conducted with non-opioid dependent participants. The current study developed a tailored BI for illicit drug use and alcohol use to a methadone maintained opioid dependent <b>polydrug</b> <b>using</b> cohort of patients. Methods Focus groups with staff and one-to-one qualitative interviews with patients guided the tailoring of all intervention materials for use in a subsequent cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT). This was done to make them contextually appropriate to an opioid dependent cohort and culturally appropriate to Ireland. Thematic analyses were utilised. Results The BI was modified to ensure its compatibility with the culture of an Irish drug using population, with elements of motivational interviewing (MI) and personalised feedback incorporated. Example scripts of a screening and BI were included, as was an algorithm to facilitate clinicians during a session. Modifications to the ‘Substance Use Risk’ cards included weighting the severity of the problems, writing the language in the first person to personalise the feedback and including tick boxes so as to further highlight the relevant risk factors for individual patients. Photographs of key risk factors were included to display pictorially risks for illiterate or semi-literate patients. Examples of the interaction of particular substances with methadone were of particular importance to this group. Modifications of the ‘Pros and Cons of Substance Use/Reasons to Quit or Cut Down’ included additional categories such as addiction, crime and money that were salient to this cohort.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. This study addresses whether ecstasy, a widely used recreational drug, adversely affects sleep, because any marked shortening of sleep {{could contribute to}} the emotional, social and intellectual deficits {{that occur in the}} days after taking the drug. The study also addresses whether ecstasy causes impaired learning of skills. Current ecstasy users as well as abstinent ecstasy users are involved in the study, and are compared to non-ecstasy <b>polydrug</b> <b>using</b> controls. The study also investigates the integrity of the memory consolidation and enhancement function of post-learning sleep in the participants. This follows from recent work with non drug taking healthy individuals that shows how a period of sleep in the night after training can lead to an enhancement of memory beyond the level seen immediately after training, and beyond the level seen if testing occurred after a similar period of wakefulness. The study will have important implications for advice to policy makers and drug users about the harmful effects of ecstasy, for advice to educators and employers about the work training needs of people who take drugs, and, at the theoretical level will have important implications for the rapidly expanding field of the investigation of the memory enhancement function of sleep...|$|R
40|$|Rationale Studies {{reporting}} ecstasy-induced serotonin-toxicity and (neuro) psychological dysfunctions {{have been}} conducted in young adults. Little is known about ecstasy effects later in life, when serotonin levels and cognition decrease {{as a consequence of}} normal ageing. Objective This study aimed to assess whether harmful effects of ecstasy only add to or also interact with age-related neuropsychological decline. Methods Attention, verbal and visual memory, visuospatial ability, self-reported depression, sensation-seeking and impulsivity were assessed in middle-aged moderate to heavy ecstasy/polydrug users (n = 17) and compared with none or very mild ecstasy <b>using</b> <b>polydrug</b> users (matched for age, gender, intelligence and other drugs; n = 16) and a group of drug-naive controls (n = 20).

40|$|Aim – Previous {{studies of}} the {{association}} between <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> and other risk behaviours have generally been limited to specific substances and {{a small number of}} behaviours. The aim {{of this study is to}} obtain better insight into <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> (comprising legal and illegal substances: tobacco, alcohol, tranquillisers/sedatives, cannabis, and other illegal drugs) and its association with co-occurring problem behaviours drawn from various broad domains (sexual, aggressive, delinquent, school achievement, relationships) among European adolescents. METHODS – Data were obtained from 101, 401 16 -year-old students from 35 European countries participating in the 2011 ESPAD survey. Associations between <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> and other problem behaviours were examined by multinomial and binary logistic regression analyses. RESULTS – Tranquillisers/sedatives appeared among the commonest combinations in the <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> pattern, especially for females. A strong trend was found between levels of involvement with <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> and other problem behaviours for both genders. The highest associations with <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> were for problems with the police, risky sexual behaviour and skipping school. Gender differences showed higher prevalences among boys than girls of problem behaviours of aggressive, antisocial type, while girls prevailed over boys in relationship problems. CONCLUSION – An incremental relationship exists between the level of involvement with <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> and the co-occurrence of problem behaviours. Preventative interventions should consider the misuse of tranquillisers/sedatives within the context of <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> by adolescents and expand their target groups towards multiple problem behaviours...|$|E
40|$|Background: Alcohol use and {{illicit drug}} use peak during young {{adulthood}} (around 18 - 29 years of age), but comparatively {{little is known about}} <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> in nationally representative samples of young adults. Drawing on a nationally representative cross-sectional survey (Australian National Drug Strategy Household Survey), this study examines <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> patterns and associated psychosocial risk factors among young adults (n = 3, 333; age 19 - 29). Method: The use of a broad range of licit and illicit drugs were examined, including alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, ecstasy, ketamine, GHB, inhalants, steroids, barbiturates, meth/amphetamines, heroin, methadone/buprenorphine, other opiates, painkillers and tranquillizers/sleeping pills.

Despite this, {{it is often difficult}} to make generalisations or conclusive statements about the neuropsychological and neurobiological correlates of chronic drug use given variations in the nature or extent of deficits observed within or across different classes of drugs. In this review, we focus specifically on the evidence for impairments in prefrontally-mediated cognitive functions that underlie behavioural regulation, namely decision making and inhibitory control. We argue that impairments in these specific domains, which are often compounded by an earlier initiation of drug <b>use,</b> <b>polydrug</b> abuse, comorbid psychiatric conditions, previous head injury, and acute withdrawal effects can serve to increase the risk for making decisions that are impulsive, focussed on short-terms gains and lack inhibitory control.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine the frequency of injecting drug use among GHB/GBL overdose patients and whether there are temporal differences in the occurrence of GHB/GBL overdoses of injecting drug and recreational drug users. Methods In this retrospective study, the ambulance and hospital records of suspected GHB- and GBL overdose patients treated by the Helsinki Emergency Medical Service from January 1 st 2006 to December 31 st 2007 were reviewed. According to the temporal occurrence of the overdose, patients were divided in two groups. In group A, the overdose occurred on a Friday-Saturday or Saturday-Sunday night between 11 pm- 6 am. Group B consisted of overdoses occurring on outside this time frame. Results Group A consisted of 39 patient contacts and the remaining 61 patient contacts were in group B. There were statistically significant differences between the two groups in (group A vs. B, respectively) : history of injecting drug abuse (33 % vs. 59 %, p = 0. 012), reported <b>polydrug</b> and ethanol <b>use</b> (80 % vs. 62 %, p = 0. 028), the location where the patients were encountered (private or public indoors or outdoors, 10 %, 41 %, 41 % vs. 25 %, 18 %, 53 %, p = 0. 019) and how the knowledge of GHB/GBL use was obtained (reported by patient/bystanders or clinical suspicion, 72 %, 28 % vs. 85 %, 10 %, p = 0. 023).

40|$|According to the {{regulations}} {{contained in the}} Social Services Act (SFS 2001 : 453), Swedish social services have a legal responsibility to provide support, care, and treatment for individuals with substance use problems.   This law mandate those who are responsible to provide treatment to motivate drug users to actively seek treatment on a voluntary basis, ensuring an end to their dependence on drugs. Studies have shown that although the treatment system largely focuses on promoting abstinence, about two-thirds of client’s relapse into substance use within one year after completing treatment. This dissertation focuses broadly on clients who repeatedly enter and use treatment for substance use disorders in the Swedish addiction treatment system. The aim of this thesis is to examine and identify the population groups who are repeated treatment users of the Swedish treatment system for substance use disorder, including both the voluntary treatment and compulsory care. This thesis was based on three national level databases. The results showed that clients with {{a higher degree of}} problems and problems in different areas of life also had an increased risk of having treatment for substance use disorder repeatedly. Clients who were older, men, reported more years of <b>polydrug</b> and alcohol <b>use</b> to intoxication, reported more compulsory care episodes for substance use, had ever been charged with crime, had ever been in inpatient mental health treatment, and had a higher ASI mental health symptom composite score, {{were significantly more likely to}} report more voluntary addiction treatment episodes. The strongest significant association with the number of treatment episodes was the number of compulsory treatment episodes for alcohol and drugs. Individuals who experienced prior compulsory care including mandatory treatment through LVU (law (1990 : 52)), been in prison, and had children mandated to out-of-home care, were more likely to have two or more entries in the compulsory care system for substance use disorder. In addition, this analysis showed that 59 % of clients mandated to compulsory care dropped-out during their compulsory care episode, and that younger clients were significantly more likely to drop-out. Those who drop-out were significantly more likely to experience negative outcomes, i. e. additional sentence to compulsory care and higher risk of mortality.   A hierarchal logistic regression model also identified that individuals with riskier childhood conditions were more likely to have had repeated entries to compulsory care for substance use disorder. The indirect effects showed that a family history of substance use disorder and psychiatric problems are both associated with higher probability of institutional care as a child i. e. LVU, and that in turn, mandated childhood institutional care is related to repeated compulsory care intakes as an adult. Individuals who use treatment for substance use disorder repeatedly have a higher degree of problems i. e. an exposed and problematic group of individuals characterized by problem in several different areas of life. Growing up in a home environment with unfavorable conditions, mandated care before the age of 18 (LVU), compulsory care for substance use disorder as an adult, children taken into out-of-home care, and crime are the factors that are primarily associated with repeated treatment for substance use. A change in the view of treatment for clients in need of repeated use of treatment seems important, and access to adapted continuous care efforts are crucial to counteract the risk of relapse after a treatment episode of voluntary or compulsory care. Further, it seems important to motivate the client to complete the compulsory care without any deviation, since this seems to have positive effects on their substance use disorder...|$|R

The overall prevalence of <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> was 21 %. The multivariate ordinal logistic regression model showed that males, participants aged 18 to 34 years and those from Chile, Uruguay and Argentina were significantly more likely to be polydrug users after adjusting for age and sex. This is the first study that documents the burden of <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> in Latin American countries. Future epidemiological studies should be conducted to examine the relationship between other demographic characteristics and risk behaviors with patterns of <b>polydrug</b> <b>use.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|The National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol (NACDA) today (24 th June 2014) {{launched}} the Drug Use in Ireland and Northern Ireland 2010 / 2011 Drug Prevalence Survey: <b>Polydrug</b> <b>Use</b> Bulletin This bulletin {{is the last}} in the current series of bulletins which arise from the data collected in the 2010 / 11 Drug Prevalence Survey. It presents prevalence rates regarding current polydrug use; that is, the use {{of more than one}} substance within the last month (last 30 days), in Ireland for 2010 / 11. These <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> prevalence rates include combinations of both legal and illegal drug use. In addition, the bulletin also examines gender and age differences and the relationship between the use of a particular substance and the use of another substance. Dr Orla Dempsey, who carried out the analysis of this data for the NACDA, noted that twenty percent of all adults aged 15 - 64 in Ireland had not used any substance (legal or illegal) in the month prior to the survey. <b>Polydrug</b> <b>use</b> is associated with a number of negative consequences including mental and physical ill-health, violence, aggression and a range of social problems. <b>Polydrug</b> <b>use</b> is more likely to result in accidents and death (including death from overdose) than when a single substance is consumed. There is evidence that <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> is common among people seeking drug treatment. <b>Polydrug</b> <b>use</b> is more complex to treat, requiring services that can treat both alcohol and other drug dependence while providing a broad range of interventions, and is associated with poorer treatment outcomes The survey found that the largest proportion of respondents (39...|$|E
40|$|Data from {{a sample}} of 329 primary heroin users and from {{a sample of}} 301 regular {{amphetamine}} users were analysed {{in order to determine}} the extent and correlates of <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> among illicit drug users. Both samples exhibited high levels of <b>polydrug</b> <b>use,</b> with means of 5. 2 (heroin) and 6. 3 (amphetamines) drug classes used in the preceding 6 months. Multi-variate analyses indicated that being younger, being male, not being in treatment, being an injector, having recently borrowed injecting equipment and being from the regular amphetamine using sample were independently associated with higher levels of <b>polydrug</b> <b>use.</b> Rather than increasing levels of <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> being associated with age, illicit drug users appear to reduce their range of drugs as they get older. The 2 ̆ 7 pure 2 ̆ 7 heroin or amphetamine user was extremely rare. It is concluded that to characterise drug users as 2 ̆ 7 heroin 2 ̆ 7 or 2 ̆ 7 amphetamine 2 ̆ 7 users misses the context in which these drugs are used...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Most {{research}} of {{ethnic differences in}} adolescent drug use resorts to combining all Hispanic individuals into one group. This study focused on <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> among adolescents residing in an in-ner-city region by Hispanic ethnicity (Puerto Rican versus Dominican) and gender. Puerto Rican and Dominican students in 22 New York City middle schools participated. Sixth and seventh graders completed self-re-port questionnaires with measures of the three gateway drugs (cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana) at baseline (N = 849) and at a one-year fol-low-up (N = 678). In {{the first year of}} middle school, gender moderated the effect of Hispanic ethnicity on lifetime <b>polydrug</b> <b>use.</b> Specifically, Dominican boys reported greater <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> than Dominican girls, but use was similar across gender for Puerto Rican adolescents. In th...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{the frequency of}} <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> (alcohol and illicit drugs) among college students and its associations with gender and age group. Methods: A nationwide sample of 12, 544 college students was {{asked to complete a}} questionnaire on their use of drugs according to three time parameters (lifetime, past 12 months, and last 30 days). The co-use of drugs was investigated as concurrent <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> (CPU) and simultaneous <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> (SPU), a subcategory of CPU that involves the use of drugs at the same time or in close temporal proximity. Results: Almost 26 % of college students reported having engaged in CPU in the past 12 months. Among these students, 37 % had engaged in SPU. In the past 30 days, 17 % college students had engaged in CPU. Among these, 35 % had engaged in SPU. Marijuana was the illicit drug mostly frequently used with alcohol (either as CPU or SPU), especially among males. Among females, the most commonly reported combination was alcohol and prescribed medications. Conclusions: A high proportion of Brazilian college students may be engaging in <b>polydrug</b> <b>use.</b> College administrators should keep themselves informed to be able to identify such use and to develop educational interventions to prevent such behavior...|$|E
40|$|Aims: Failure to {{complete}} high school predicts substantial {{economic and social}} disadvantage in adult life. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the longitudinal association of mid-adolescent <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> and high school non-completion, relative to other drug use profiles. Design: A longitudinal analysis of the relationship between <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> in three cohorts at grade 9 (age 14 – 15 years) and school non-completion (reported post-high school). Setting: A State-representative sample of students across Victoria, Australia. Participants: A total of 2287 secondary school students from 152 high schools. The retention rate was 85...|$|E
40|$|This {{bulletin}} presents key {{findings on}} <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> (the use {{of more than}} one substance within a specific time period). It presents data collected in the All Ireland Drug Prevalence Survey 2006 / 2007 relating to <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> on a last month (current use) basis. The focus is on the combinations of both legal and illegal drugs based on information obtained from the second drug prevalence survey of households to be carried out in both Ireland and Northern Ireland. The bulletin also examines gender and age differences and the relationship between the use of a particular substance and the use of another substance...|$|E
40|$|Simultaneous <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> in {{undergraduate}} students was studied in one university in Kingston, Jamaica. The {{study was a}} cross-sectional, and used a survey method of data collection. We examined protective and risk factors associated with simultaneous <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> {{in a sample of}} 295 undergraduate students from the health and medical science departments in the university. Our results suggest that continued residence with family, family support, and students' emotional well-being are protective factors. On the other hand, ease of access of substance and limited emotional support may be considered risk factors. Our findings may inform preventive programs, though further research is required...|$|E
40|$|Resiliency theory {{provides}} {{a conceptual framework}} for studying why some youth exposed to risk factors do not develop the negative behaviors they predict. The {{purpose of this study}} was to test compensatory and protective models of resiliency in a longitudinal sample of urban adolescents (80 % African American). The data were from Years 1 (9 th grade) and 4 (12 th grade). The study examined effects of cumulative risk and promotive factors on adolescent <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> including alcohol, tobacco and marijuana. Cumulative measures of risk/promotive factors represented individual characteristics, peer influence, and parental/familial influences. After controlling for demographics, results of multiple regression of <b>polydrug</b> <b>use</b> support the compensatory model of resiliency both cross‐sectionally and longitudinally. Promotive factors were also found to have compensatory effects on change in adolescent <b>polydrug</b> <b>use.</b> The protective model of resiliency evidenced cross‐sectionally was not supported in longitudinal analysis. The findings support resiliency theory and the use of cumulative risk/promotive measures in resiliency research. Implications focused on utilizing multiple assets and resources in prevention programming are discussed...|$|E
