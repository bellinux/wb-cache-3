5|$|L D Institute of Indology houses about 76,000 hand-written Jain manuscripts with 500 {{illustrated}} versions and 45,000 printed books, {{making it}} the largest collection of Jain scripts, Indian sculptures, terracottas, miniature <b>paintings,</b> cloth <b>paintings,</b> painted scrolls, bronzes, woodwork, Indian coins, textiles and decorative art, <b>paintings</b> of Rabindranath Tagore and art of Nepal and Tibet.

50|$|As {{most of the}} <b>painting’s</b> {{inscriptions}} {{were not}} transported to the ROM from China and the Xinghua si monastery fell to ruins in 1938, {{it is impossible to}} get a full record of the <b>painting’s</b> background information. Both White and Bachlofer made assumptions in their findings and as such, neither has been able to make a full claim on the <b>painting’s</b> date. As such, The Paradise of Maitreya remains the most controversial painting from the Yuan dynasty.|$|R

5|$|Modelling is {{far from}} the only {{possible}} way to illustrate mathematical concepts. Giotto's Stefaneschi Triptych, 1320, illustrates recursion in the form of mise en abyme; the central panel of the triptych contains, lower left, the kneeling figure of Cardinal Stefaneschi, holding up the triptych as an offering. Giorgio Chirico's metaphysical <b>paintings</b> such as his 1917 Great Metaphysical Interior explore the question of levels of representation in art by depicting <b>paintings</b> within his <b>paintings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Painting is {{a recent}} art form common among women artists. Famous artists include Yvette Bouquet from Koumac who has {{produced}} <b>paintings</b> with Pacific and Oceania themes, Paula Boi, whose <b>paintings</b> are of more abstract scenes, and Denise Tuvouane and Maryline Thydjepache who use mixed art forms. Bus stop shelters are common places where their <b>paintings</b> are illustrated.|$|E
5|$|<b>Paintings</b> from a cave at Hindagala {{date back}} to the late Anuradhapura period, and may even belong to the same period as the Sigiriya <b>paintings.</b> The <b>paintings</b> of Sigiriya and Hindagala are the only {{surviving}} specimens of art of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. However, remnants of <b>paintings</b> indicate that walls and ceilings of some buildings and the inside walls of stupas and vahalkadas were also painted. Saddhatissa had employed painters to decorate the Ruwanweli Seya when his brother Dutthagamani wanted to see it on his death bed.|$|E

5|$|The National Gallery {{opened to}} the public on 10 May 1824, housed in Angerstein's former townhouse at No. 100 Pall Mall. Angerstein's <b>paintings</b> were joined in 1826 by those from Beaumont's collection, and in 1831 by the Reverend William Holwell Carr's bequest of 35 <b>paintings.</b> Initially the Keeper of <b>Paintings,</b> William Seguier, bore the burden of {{managing}} the Gallery, but in July 1824 some of this responsibility fell to the newly formed board of trustees.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} date that appears on Ruisdael's <b>paintings</b> and etchings is 1646. Two years after this date he {{was admitted to}} membership of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke. By this time landscape <b>paintings</b> were as popular as history <b>paintings</b> in Dutch households, though {{at the time of}} Ruisdael's birth, history <b>paintings</b> appeared far more frequently. This growth in popularity of landscapes continued throughout Ruisdael's career.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum has}} a {{permanent}} exhibition of <b>paintings</b> by Lodewijk Bruckman (1903–1995). Bruckman lived in Bellingwolde {{in a hotel}} opposite to the museum from 1987 to 1989. He donated 21 <b>paintings</b> to the Bellingwedde municipality in 1988. These <b>paintings,</b> which are now exhibited in the museum, are mostly still lifes in a style which is described as realistic, surrealistic, or magic realistic.|$|E

5|$|A pair {{of large}} canvases with hunting dogs by Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1742), now {{hanging in the}} Salle du synode, once hung in the Parisian hôtel particulier of Samuel-Jacques Bernard. The three <b>paintings</b> in the chapel are copies of works by Antonio da Correggio: Adoration of the Shepherds, Virgin and Child with Sts Jerome and Madeleine, and The Rest on the Return from Egypt. They were made in 1724 in Modena and Parma by Robert deSéry (1686–1733) for Armand Gaston, whom he had met in Rome the same year. DeSéry would later provide many other <b>paintings</b> for the cardinal's apartments, all of them copies of <b>paintings</b> by greater masters. Napoleon's green bed is an {{authentic}} work by Jacob-Desmalter.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the mundane}} subject was {{constant}} throughout the Haystack series, the underlying theme {{may be seen}} as the transience of light. This concept enabled Monet to use repetition to show nuances of perception as the time of day, the seasons and the weather changed. The almost unvarying subject provided the basis for him to compare changes of light and mood across his nuanced series. The first <b>paintings</b> in the series were started in late September or early October 1890, and he continued producing these <b>paintings</b> for about seven months. These <b>paintings</b> made Monet the first painter to paint such a large quantity of pictures of the same subject matter differentiated by light, weather, atmosphere and perspective.|$|E
50|$|The <b>painting's</b> {{attribution}} {{has been}} brought into question and some have claimed it is by Sofonisba Anguissola. The sitter is also unknown, but considering the <b>painting's</b> royal provenance, {{the value of the}} fur and the jeweled necklace, various guesses have been made based on her widow's peak that it could be someone from Louis Philippe's royal family.|$|R
50|$|According to the Musée d'Orsay catalogue, the <b>painting's</b> {{principal}} {{subject is}} représentation animalière or {{the depiction of}} animals. As suggested by the <b>painting's</b> Japanese name and observed in the contemporary Japanese press, the work draws heavily on Japanese mythology, in particular the episode of the sun goddess Amaterasu's withdrawal into a cave due to her brother Susanoo's improprieties, depriving the land of light.|$|R

5|$|Animals, often mammals but {{including}} {{fish and}} insects among other groups, {{have been the}} subjects of art from the earliest times, both historical, as in Ancient Egypt, and prehistoric, as in the cave <b>paintings</b> at Lascaux and other sites in the Dordogne, France and elsewhere. Major animal <b>paintings</b> include Albrecht Dürer's 1515 The Rhinoceros, and George Stubbs's c. 1762 horse portrait Whistlejacket.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Monet's {{innovative}} use {{of light}} and color led to its rejection by the Paris Salon of 1869. Today, art historians classify The Magpie as one of Monet's best snowscape <b>paintings.</b> The painting was privately held until the Musée d'Orsay acquired it in 1984; it {{is considered one of}} the most popular <b>paintings</b> in their permanent collection.|$|E
5|$|Baron Edmond de Sélys Longchamps {{coined the}} name Raphus solitarius for these birds in 1848, as he {{believed}} the accounts referred to a species of dodo. When 17th-century <b>paintings</b> of white dodos were discovered by 19th-century naturalists, it was assumed they depicted these birds. Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans suggested that {{the discrepancy between the}} <b>paintings</b> and the old descriptions was that the <b>paintings</b> showed females, and that the species was therefore sexually dimorphic. Some authors also believed the birds described were of a species similar to the Rodrigues solitaire, as it was referred to by the same name, or even that there were white species of both dodo and solitaire on the island.|$|E
