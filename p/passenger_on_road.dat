40|$|When a {{taxi driver}} of an unoccupied taxi is seeking <b>passengers</b> <b>on</b> a <b>road</b> unknown {{to him or her}} in a large city, what should the driver do? Alternatives include {{cruising}} around the road or waiting for a time period at the roadside in the hopes of finding a passenger or just leaving for another road enroute to a destination he knows (e. g., hotel taxi rank) ? This is an interesting problem that arises everyday in many cities worldwide. There could be different answers to the question poised above, but one fundamental problem is how the driver learns about the likelihood of finding <b>passengers</b> <b>on</b> a <b>road</b> that is new to him (as in he has not picked up or dropped off passengers there before). Our observation from large scale taxi drivers behavior data is that a driver not only learns from his own experience but through interactions with other drivers. In this paper, we first formally define this problem as Socialized Information Learning (SIL), second we propose a framework including a series of models to study how {{a taxi driver}} gathers and learns information in an uncertain environment through the use of his social network. Finally, the large scale real life data and empirical experiments confirm that our models are much more effective, efficient and scalable that prior work on this problem...|$|R

40|$|Exchange of {{geographical}} movement information is an im-portant and potential life-saving feature for vehicular sys-tems. By exchanging and processing their movement infor-mation, vehicles can easily detect dangers such as intersec-tion collisions or notification of accidents ahead, thus im-proving {{the safety of}} drivers and <b>passengers</b> <b>on</b> the <b>road.</b> Many applications for active safety in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) operate in a decentralized fashion, namely by Vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) communications without using any infrastructure. This paper describes such a kind of ve-hicular communication system that uses an efficient dissem-ination mechanism known as MHVB for the exchange {{of geographical}} location information at the network layer. The system targets active safety applications that have high re-quirements with respect to transmission delay and packet loss probability.

In this regard, the research develops failure probability model of vehicle emission test for passenger car which utilize binomial logit model. The model focuses on failure of CO and HC emission test for gasoline cars category and Opacity emission test for diesel-fuel cars category as dependent variables, while vehicle age, engine size, brand {{and type of}} the cars as independent variables. In order to implement the model, a survey to measure the vehicle emission was done to the two categories of <b>passenger</b> cars <b>on</b> <b>road.</b> Other information related to {{the characteristics of the}} cars sampling was collected in the survey. The survey was done at two main roads in Makassar City, one of the large cities in Indonesia. According to calculation result, the model gave good appearance. In further, the results showed that vehicle age became significant variable to determine the failure probability of vehicle emission test for CO and HC emission of gasoline cars category. As well as, engine size gave significant contribution to the failure of Opacity emission test for diesel-fuel cars category. The model provides good expectation to be tested in others cases and to develop failure model of vehicle emission test on macro scale in further studies...|$|R
