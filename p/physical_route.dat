5|$|Records {{indicate}} that the alignment of PA371 was first constructed as a cut from the Delaware River to the community of Great Bend, Pennsylvania, in1791 through Wayne and Susquehanna Counties. In1801, the state legislature of New York and Pennsylvania brought up the proposal for the Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike (later the Great Bend and Newburgh Turnpike) to connect the Hudson River to the Delaware River. Although the route was finished in New York, the portion in Pennsylvania was not legislated until March29,1804. Construction through Wayne and Susquehanna Counties commenced in1806, with completion of the roadway coming in1811. At that point, the turnpike was extended onto the cut in Pennsylvania to the Susquehanna River. The turnpike was used for transportation of farmers' goods and stock along with a route for pioneers to use for heading westward. After construction of the original CochectonDamascus Bridge in 1817 (and later in 1821), {{the area around the}} bridge became a bustling community. The alignment of what is now PA371 eventually became littered with a large rate of development, with nineteenth-century style buildings constructed in Damascus. The turnpike itself fared poorly later on, and was abandoned in1853. Although the roadway itself was abandoned, the turnpike corporation that was supposed to maintain the roadway remained intact until 1868, when it was dissolved. Even afterwards, the roadway remained the only <b>physical</b> <b>route</b> in the area until at least the1890s.|$|E

With this location data and other context variables we can determine places {{that are important to}} the user, and make predictions about the next location when the user is moving. The predictions and location data can be made available to others, in a form of a presence service. The learning algorithms work solely on the user’s personal phone and do not need any external server infrastructure. Because the user is in control of the movement data, we avoid otherwise problematic privacy issues. This paper describes the task of learning routes and predicting future locations by maintaining a database of <b>physical</b> <b>routes.</b> Route predictions are based on approximate string matching techniques. When a confident prediction cannot be made, we attempt to predict at least the general direction of movement by finding places where different routes fork. ...|$|R
