50|$|The <b>Poncelet</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is a type}} of {{waterwheel}} {{invented by}} Jean-Victor Poncelet while working at the Ã‰cole d'Application in Metz. It roughly doubled the efficiency of existing undershot waterwheels through a series of detail improvements. The first <b>Poncelet</b> <b>wheel</b> was constructed in 1838, and the design quickly became common in France. Although the design was a great improvement on existing designs, further improvements in turbine design rendered the <b>Poncelet</b> <b>wheel</b> obsolete by the mid-century.|$|E

40|$|Water {{wheels are}} {{the topic of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis, which {{is divided into three}} parts. The first one describes a history of water wheels. The second part is focused on different types of water wheels and basic part of water construction. In the last part is concept and calculation of overshot bucket water wheel and adjustment of the parameters of <b>Poncelet</b> water <b>wheel...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Jean Charles de Borda was {{the first}} to {{directly}} characterize the efficiency of waterwheels by comparing the velocities of water before and after meeting the <b>wheel.</b> <b>Poncelet</b> was familiar with this work and started looking for ways to improve the design. He stated that [...] "After having reflected on this, {{it seemed to me that}} we could fulfil this double condition by replacing the straight blades on ordinary wheels with curved or cylindrical blades, presenting their concavity to the current." ...|$|R
50|$|The Duke of Marlborough's Blenheim estate adjoins the village. The estate's former sawmill, Combe Mill, is now {{a working}} museum. It was {{originally}} powered by a leat from the Evenlode that turned a breastshot water wheel. It has also a steam-powered rotative beam engine driven by a Cornish boiler, {{both of which were}} added in 1852. In 1926 the old water wheel was replaced with a more efficient <b>Poncelet</b> <b>wheel.</b> The mill {{is now a}} Grade II* listed building.|$|E
