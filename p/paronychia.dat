25|$|Several {{species of}} plants have been named for William Baldwin. Among those names that are still in use, we have, {{including}} authors, the following names: Eleocharis baldwinii (John Torrey) Alvan Wentworth Chapman, Rhynchospora baldwinii Asa Gray, Saccharum baldwinii Curt Sprengel, Clematis baldwinii John Torrey and Asa Gray, <b>Paronychia</b> baldwinii (Torrey and Gray) Eduard Fenzl and Wilhelm Walpers, Eryngium baldwinii Curt Sprengel, Vernonia baldwinii John Torrey, Xyris baldwiniana Josef Schultes, and Matelea baldwyniana (Robert Sweet) Robert Woodson.|$|E
25|$|Clotrimazole may be {{compounded}} with a glucocorticoid, such as betamethasone, in a topical cream {{for the treatment}} of tinea corporis (ringworm), tinea cruris (jock itch) and tinea pedis (athlete's foot). Although FDA approved, clotrimazole-betamethasone combination cream is not the preferred treatment for dermatophyte infections due to increased side effects from the topical glucocorticoid. Although temporary relief and partial suppression of symptoms may be observed with the combination therapy, glucocorticoids can elicite an immunosuppressive response and rebound effect that results in more severe infection typically requiring systemic antifungal agents to treat the disease. Combination creams are best avoided in order to improve treatment outcome, reduce the possibility of skin atrophy associated with prolonged topical glucocorticoid use, and to limit the cost of treatment. It can be effective in treating chronic <b>paronychia.</b> The preferred treatment of tinea infections is therefore with clotrimazole monotherapy.|$|E
50|$|Augustin François César Prouvençal de Saint-Hilaire (4 October 1779 - 3 September 1853), French {{botanist}} and traveler, {{was born}} at Orléans, France, on 4 October 1779. A keen observer, he is credited with important discoveries in botany, notably {{the direction of the}} radicle in the embryo sac and the double point of attachment of certain ovules. He also described two families, the <b>Paronychiae</b> and the Tamariscinae, as well as a large number of genera and species.|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcus lugdunensis, a rare {{cause of}} severe infections such as native valve endocarditis, often causes {{superficial}} skin infections similar to Staphylococcus aureus infections. We initiated {{a study to}} optimize the identification methods in the routine laboratory, followed by a population-based epidemiologic analysis of patients infected with S. lugdunensis in Viborg County, Denmark. Recognition of a characteristic Eikenella corrodens-like odor on Columbia sheep blood agar combined with colony pleomorphism and prominent β-hemolysis after 2 days of incubation, confirmed by API-ID- 32 Staph, led to an 11 -fold increase in the detection of S. lugdunensis. By these methods we found 491 S. lugdunensis infections in 4 years, corresponding to an incidence of 53 per 100, 000 per year, an increase from 5 infections per 100, 000 inhabitants in the preceding years. Seventy-five {{percent of the cases}} were found in general practice; these were dominated by skin abscesses (36 %), wound infections (25 %), and <b>paronychias</b> (13 %). Fifty-six percent of the infections occurred below the waist, and toes were the most frequently infected site (21 %). Only 3 % of the patients suffered from severe invasive infections. The median age was 52 years, and the male/female ratio was 0. 69. Our study shows that S. lugdunensis is a common cause of skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTI) and is probably underrated by many laboratories. S. lugdunensis should be accepted as a significant pathogen in SSTI and should be looked for in all routine bacteriological examinations, and clinicians should be acquainted with the name and the pathology of the bacterium...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Paronychia</b> is a nail {{disease that}} is an often-tender {{bacterial}} or fungal infection of the hand or foot where the nail and skin meet at the side or {{the base of a}} finger or toenail. The infection can start suddenly (acute <b>paronychia)</b> or gradually (chronic <b>paronychia).</b> <b>Paronychia</b> is commonly misapplied as a synonym for whitlow or felon. The term is from παρωνυχία from para, [...] "around" [...] and onukh-, [...] "nail".|$|E
50|$|Herpes whitlows are {{frequently}} found among dentists and dental hygienists. Prosector's <b>paronychia</b> {{is a primary}} inoculation of tuberculosis of the skin and nails, named after its association with prosectors, who prepare specimens for dissection. <b>Paronychia</b> around the entire nail is {{sometimes referred to as}} runaround <b>paronychia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Acute <b>paronychia</b> {{is usually}} caused by bacteria. Claims {{have also been}} made that the popular acne medication, isotretinoin, has caused <b>paronychia</b> to develop in patients. <b>Paronychia</b> is often treated with antibiotics, either topical or oral. Chronic <b>paronychia</b> is most often caused by a yeast {{infection}} of the soft tissues around the nail but can also be traced to a bacterial infection. If the infection is continuous, the cause is often fungal and needs antifungal cream or paint to be treated.|$|E
50|$|Hangnails {{can become}} {{infected}} and cause <b>paronychia,</b> {{a type of}} skin infection that occurs around the nails. Treatments for <b>paronychia</b> vary with severity, but may include soaking in hot salty water, the use of oral antibiotic medication, or clinical lancing. <b>Paronychia</b> itself rarely results in further complications but can lead to abscess, permanent changes {{to the shape of}} the nail or the spread of infection.|$|E

5000|$|Chronic <b>paronychia</b> is an {{infection}} of the folds of tissue surrounding the nail of a finger or, less commonly, a toe, lasting more than six weeks. It is a nail disease prevalent in individuals whose hands or feet are subject to moist local environments, and is often due to contact dermatitis. In chronic <b>paronychia,</b> the cuticle separates from the nail plate, leaving the region between the proximal nail fold and the nail plate vulnerable to infection. It can {{be the result of}} dish washing, finger sucking, aggressively trimming the cuticles, or frequent contact with chemicals (mild alkalis, acids, etc.). Chronic <b>paronychia</b> is treated by avoiding whatever is causing it, a topical antifungal, and a topical steroid. In those who do not improve following these measures oral antifungals and steroids may be used or the nail fold may be removed surgically.|$|E

5000|$|Acute <b>paronychia</b> is an {{infection}} of the folds of tissue surrounding the nail of a finger or, less commonly, a toe, lasting less than six weeks. The infection generally starts in the paronychium {{at the side of}} the nail, with local redness, swelling, and pain. Acute <b>paronychia</b> is usually caused by direct or indirect trauma to the cuticle or nail fold, and may be from relatively minor events, such as dishwashing, an injury from a splinter or thorn, nail biting, biting or picking at a hangnail, finger sucking, an ingrown nail, or manicure procedures. When no pus is present, warm soaks for acute <b>paronychia</b> is reasonable, even though there is a lack of evidence to support its use. Antibiotics such as clindamycin or cephalexin are also often used, the first being more effective in areas where MRSA is common. If there are signs of an abscess (the presence of pus) drainage is recommended.|$|E
