40|$|Thermal {{analysis}} methods (differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis) {{were used to}} characterize the nature of polyester-melamine coating matrices prepared under nonisothermal, high-temperature, rapid-cure conditions. The results were interpreted {{in terms of the}} formation of two interpenetrating networks with different glass-transition temperatures (a cocondensed polyester-melamine network and a self-condensed melamine-melamine network), a phenomenon not generally seen in chemically similar, isothermally cured matrices. The self-condensed network manifested at high melamine levels, but the relative concentrations of the two networks were critically dependent on the cure conditions. The optimal cure (defined in terms of the attainment of a <b>peak</b> <b>metal</b> <b>temperature)</b> was achieved at different oven temperatures and different oven dwell times, and so the actual energy absorbed varied over a wide range. Careful control of the energy absorption, by the selection of appropriate cure conditions, controlled the relative concentrations of the two networks and, therefore, the flexibility and hardness of the resultant coatings.

The cured coatings were exposed in a QUV A accelerated ageing test with exposure time intervals of 1200 hours and 4098 hours. Isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) cross-linker gave lower cross-linking density and degradation rate to the PU coating compared to hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI). Cyclic trimer (CT) isocyanate cross-linker gave higher durability compared to biuret (BI). A primary amide and urea entity rich top-film was formed at the surface of degraded PU coatings, with characteristic IR bands at 1640 cm- 1 and 1560 cm- 1.

A preliminary design study provided several suitable thermal protection system designs for the combustor, one of which was a two-pass regenerative type air-cooled omega-shaped segment liner. A final design layout of the omega segment liner was prepared and analyzed for steady-state and transient conditions. The design of a support system for the fuel spray bar assembly was also included. Detail drawings suitable for fabrication purposes were also prepared. Liner design problems defined during the preliminary study included (1) the ingress of gas into the attachment bulb section of the omega segment, (2) the large thermal gradient along the leg of the omega bulb attachment section and, (3) the local <b>peak</b> <b>metal</b> <b>temperature</b> at the radius between the liner ID and the leg of the bulb attachment.

40|$|Modern {{gas turbine}} engines operate at {{temperatures}} {{well above the}} melting point of the metal components. This has driven manufactures to develop sophisticated cooling methods which minimise the use of coolant to maximise engine efficiency by enabling further increases in operating temperature. This thesis investigates the cooling performance of engine representative mid-chord internal cooling passages for turbine blades. The work forms {{part of a larger}} E. C. FP 7 project ERICKA (Engine Representative Internal Cooling Knowledge Applications). This thesis provides detailed maps of heat transfer coefficient (HTC) under a number of conditions, new experimental techniques, and has lead {{to a better understanding of}} the impact HTC distributions have on the thermal performance of a turbine blade at engine conditions. Transient liquid crystal experiments have been conducted on a large scale model of an engine representative internal cooling passage at three aspect ratios (width:height (chord length:spanwise length), 1 : 2, 1 : 3 and 1 : 4). Spatially resolved maps of Nusselt number have been produced for the full surface of the internal cooling passages. Little information exists in the literature for more engine representative geometries, and it is rare for spatial measurements to be presented over the full surface. The detailed maps provide validation data for CFD within the ERICKA programme. A novel method which produces spatially resolved maps in areas with highly non-one-dimensional heat transfer has been developed and validated. This method couples transient finite element analysis and data from transient liquid crystal experiments. Applied to the ribbed passage geometry, this produced spatially resolved maps of HTC over the rib surface. To the author’s best knowledge this is the first time spatial HTC maps have been presented for an engine representative rib. Industry best practice methods for internal cooling passage design typically apply averaged values of HTC, in part due to lack of spatially resolved data. To determine the significance of this approximation on blade design and life, experimental measurements have been applied to finite element (FEA) models at typical engine conditions. Application of a 3 D HTC distribution to a FEA model of a section of ribbed wall demonstrated a significant under prediction (up to 58 %) of localised thermal gradients when an average value is applied compared to a spatially resolved profile. This work demonstrated good agreement between distributions taken from experimental data and CFD predictions, indicating that CFD distributions may be more appropriate than bulk values in the design process. A 2 D FEA study was undertaken to quantify the impact of HTC distribution approximations and aspect ratio on cooling of a generic turbine section. This study considered multiple adjacent internal cooling passages. It was confirmed that multi-pass arrangements offer greater heat removal for a given mass flow rate. Also a symmetric heat transfer profile with a higher HTC on the ribbed wall is the most desirable distribution. Use of average values significantly impacted the <b>metal</b> <b>temperature,</b> causing an underprediction up to 13 ◦C and 8 ◦C in the maximum and average values respectively. Based on the experimental HTC data, the 1 : 3 aspect ratio passage offered the lowest <b>metal</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Applying HTC distributions from CFD data (calculated with using the centreline temperature) showed, in general, good agreement, with the lowest <b>metal</b> <b>temperatures</b> (by up to 8 ◦C) in the 1 : 4 aspect ratio passage. Use of and HTC distribution provided by CFD prediction based on the mixed bulk temperature, produced average and <b>peak</b> <b>metal</b> <b>temperatures</b> 16 ◦C and 17 ◦C, respectively, lower in the 1 : 4 aspect ratio passage than the next best design. This highlights the need for appropriate and consistent method to be used in the analysis. As expected, reducing the passage aspect ratio led to increases in both thermal gradient and total pressure loss. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R

40|$|The {{strength}} of intercoat adhesion exhibited between {{a series of}} polyester/polyurethane (PU) based primer formulations and a standard poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVdF) based topcoat formulation has been investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). An initial XPS study of changes in surface elemental composition (induced by variation of the <b>peak</b> <b>metal</b> <b>temperature</b> (PMT) achieved during thermal curing), on {{a subset of the}} PU primers employed, indicates that beyond a PMT of 232 °C changes in PU primer surface composition are negligible. A reference PU primer coating formulation and four variations of this formulation, produced by including, excluding or substituting components/additives in the reference formulation, are characterised by XPS. The PU primer formulation in which a flow agent additive is included exhibits segregation of the flow agent to the primer surface. The PU primer and PVdF topcoat intercoat adhesion failure surfaces resulting from failure at or near the PVdF/PU interface {{as a result of a}} peel test are also characterised by XPS. Additionally the PVdF topcoat air-coating surface is characterised by XPS. The interface analyses for the flow agent containing PU primer formulation indicates stripping of the flow agent layer from the PU primer and transfer of the flow agent to the PVdF topcoat interfacial failure surface. Similarly, PU primer formulations in which the concentrations of a crosslinking resin are changed demonstrate that the transfer of carbon and oxygen containing materials from the PU primer to the PVdF topcoat occurs, due to insufficient crosslinking of the polyester component of the PU primer formulation. These results suggest a correlation between the nitrogen concentration at the PU primer surface and the {{strength of}} the intercoat adhesion exhibited by the PU primer towards the PVdF topcoat...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuing}} maturation {{of metal}} laser-sintering technology has presented {{the opportunity to}} de-risk the engine design process by experimentally down-selecting high pressure nozzle guide vane (HPNGV) cooling designs using laboratory tests of laser-sinteredâinstead of castâparts to assess thermal performance. Such tests are very promising as a reliable predictor of the thermal-paint-engine-test, which is used during certification to validate cooling system designs. In this thesis, conventionally cast and laser-sintered parts are compared in back-to-back experimental tests at engine-representative conditions over a range of coolant mass flow rates. Tests were performed in the University of Oxford Annular Sector Heat Transfer Facility. The aerothermal performance of the cast and laser-sintered parts is shown to be very similar, demonstrating the utility of laser-sintered parts for preliminary engine thermal assessments. It can be shown that in most situations counter-current heat exchanger arrangements outperform co-current arrangements. This concept, though familiar in the heat exchanger community, {{has not yet been}} applied to hot-section gas turbine cooling. In this thesis, the performance benefit of novel reverse-pass cooling systemsâthat is, systems in which the internal coolant flows substantially in the opposite direction to the mainstream flowâis demonstrated numerically and experimentally in film-cooled HPNGVs. It is shown numerically that reverse-pass cooling systems always act to flatten lateral wall temperature variation and to reduce <b>peak</b> <b>metal</b> <b>temperature</b> by maximising internal convective cooling at the point of minimum film cooling effectiveness. Reverse-pass cooling systems therefore require less coolant than other internal flow arrangements to maintain acceptable metal temperatures. The benefits of reverse-pass cooling can be fully realised in systems with long, undisturbed surface length, such as the suction-side (SS) of a HPNGV, afterburner liners, HPNGV platforms, and combustor liners. Three engine-scale HPNGVs with SS reverse-pass cooling systems were subsequently designed using bespoke numerical conjugate heat transfer and aerodynamic models to satisfy engine-realistic aerothermal and manufacturing constraints. The reverse-pass HPNGVs were metal laser-sintered and tested in back-to-back experiments with conventionally cooled HPNGVs in the Annular Sector Heat Transfer Facility. The reverse-pass HPNGVs are shown to reduce peak engine metal temperature by 30 K and reduce mean SS engine metal temperature by 60 K compared to conventionally cooled HPNGVs with the same cooling mass flow. A physically-based infra-red thermography procedure was implemented which takes into account the transmittance of the external optics, the surface emissivity of the object, the black-body temperature-radiometric characteristics of the camera, and the time-varying surrounding radiance. Failure to account for surrounding radiance is shown to result in an absolute error in overall cooling effectiveness of 0. 05. A new experimental facilityâthe Coolant Capacity Rigâwas developed in order to measure row-by-row, compartmental and total coolant capacity of HPNGVs to a precision of 0. 03 %, over a large range of pressure ratios and mass flows using a differential mass flow measurement technique, bypass system, and calibrated mass flow orifice. A novel method for estimating internal loss coefficients from the coolant capacity measurements has been devised which, uniquely, does not require internal pressure measurement. </p...|$|E

As the welding arc voltage increases starting from 140 V, the tensile strength of the weldment also increases but the higher arc values results in more spatters around the weld seam up to 180 V. Conversely, the lower arc voltages causes poor tensile strength values to weldments. Tensile tests proved {{that all of the}} samples are split from each other in the welding zone but deformation occurs in duplex plates during the tensile testing of weldments so that the elongation values are not practically notable. The satisfactory tensile strength and bending values are determined by applying 180 volts of welding arc voltage according to ISO 14555 standard. Peak values of micro hardness occurred in weld metal most probably as a consequence of increasing heat input decreasing the delta ferrite ratios.

Radiant Coil vibration was observed in tubes some remedial measures pertaining to mechanical aspects were studied and implemented. However, a need of comprehensive study to identify and minimize the coil vibration problem was felt to ensure reliable operation of the heater. In this work, Flexibility analysis of Heater Radiant Coil by modeling applied end conditions and various temperature cases was performed to verify the mechanical design and to understand the probable reasons of coil lifting.

The effects of different film cooling geometries, mainstream turbulence, hot gas acceleration etc. are also investigated. It is found that for an actual liner wall, optimum values of mass flow ratio deviate significantly from unity. Increasing inlet pressure leads to increasing <b>metal</b> <b>temperatures</b> and the optimum value of mass flow ratio depends mainly upon internal radiation in the primary zone, convective components in the intermediate zone and the mainstream temperatures in the dilutio...|$|R
40|$|The {{sand mold}} 3 D {{printing}} technologies enable the manufacturing of molds with great dimensional accuracy. However, the roughness of as-cast components is higher when {{cast in a}} 3 D printed mold {{rather than in a}} traditional sand mold. Coating the inner cavity is an efficient solution but can be costly and, in the narrowest cavities, not achievable. Finding a procedure to reduce the as-cast roughness without coating would ease the casting procedures. In the present work, surface analysis of ZE 41 magnesium alloy is presented after being cast in 3 D printed furan sand molds without coating using the low-pressure casting process. The molten <b>metal</b> <b>temperature</b> was measured during casting at different positions along the cast cavity. The as-cast surface roughness was correlated to the molten <b>metal</b> <b>temperature</b> and solid fraction at the time of contact against the sand mold surface...|$|R
40|$|Conjugate Heat Transfer {{studies are}} a common method to predict the thermal loading in high {{pressure}} nozzles. Despite the accuracy of nowadays tools, {{it is not clear}} how to include the uncertainties associated to the turbulence level, the temperature distribution or the thermal barrier coating thickness in the numerical simulations. All these parameters are stochastic even if their value is commonly assumed to be deterministic. For the first time, in this work a stochastic analysis is used to predict the <b>metal</b> <b>temperature</b> in a real high pressure nozzle. The domain is the complete high pressure nozzle of F-type Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gas turbine with impingement, film and trailing edge cooling. The stochastic variations are included by coupling Uncertainty Quantification Methods and Conjugate Heat Transfer. Two Uncertainty Quantification methods have been compared: a Probabilistic Collocation Method (PCM) and a Stochastic Collocation Method (SCM). The stochastic distribution of thermal barrier coating thickness, used in the simulations, has been measured at the midspan. A Gaussian distribution for the turbulence intensity and hot core location has been assumed. By using PCM and SCM, the probability to obtain specific <b>metal</b> <b>temperature</b> at midspan is evaluated. The two methods predict the same distribution of temperature with a maximum difference of 0. 6 % and the results are compared with the experimental data measured in the real engine. The experimental data are inside the uncertainty band associated to the CFD predictions except near at the trailing edge on the pressure side, This work shows that one of the most important parameters affecting the <b>metal</b> <b>temperature</b> uncertainty is the pitch-wise location of the hot core. Assuming a probability distribution for this location, with a standard deviation of 1. 7 degrees, the <b>metal</b> <b>temperature</b> at midspan can change up to 30 %. The impact of turbulence level and thermal barrier coating thickness is one order of magnitude less important. Copyright © 2012 by ASME...|$|R
