40|$|A {{land-based}} culture {{facility for}} research on yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares, was developed at the Achotines Laboratory in the Republic of Panama. Six concrete tanks, and seawater and life support systems were built to maintain a yellowfin broodstock. On average, 50 % of the yellowfin caught survived capture and handling, and approximately 30 % became broodstock in Tank 1 (17 m diameter, 6 m depth) or Tank 2 (8. 5 m diameter, 3 m depth). Each fish was tagged with a microchip implant tag, then weighed, measured, and injected with oxytetracycline (OTC) prior to stocking. Daily rations of primarily market squid, Loligo opalescens, and <b>Pacific</b> <b>thread</b> <b>herring,</b> Opisthonema spp., were regulated based on the feeding activity and energy requirements of the fish. Feeding activity of the broodstock decreased when the water temperatures decreased, and the fish ate decreasing daily rations and increasing calories with increasing size. Spawning occurred in both tanks within 6 – 8 months of capture. Spawning first occurred in Tank 1 when 24 females ranged in size from 6 to 16 kg and 65 to 93 cm fork length (FL). Spawning was intermittent during the first 2 months and occurred near daily thereafter. Tank size appeared to affect survival rates, the types of mortalities that occurred, {{and the growth of}} the fish. Survival rates after 1 year in captivity were higher, and the fish were larger, on average, in Tank 1 than in Tank 2. Most of the mortalities in Tank 1 were the result of wall strikes, which occurred more frequently after the fish reached their highest density of 0. 64 kg m 3 and sizes greater than 96 cm FL and 19 kg. Non-linear growth models were fitted to the initial stocking sizes and final sizes of fish that die...|$|E

40|$|We {{present data}} on ichthyoplankton distribution, abundance, and {{seasonality}} and supporting environmental information for four species of coastal pelagics {{from the family}} Clupeidae: round herring Etrumeus teres, scaled sardine Harengula jaguana, Atlantic <b>thread</b> <b>herring</b> Opisthonema oglinum, and Spanish sardine Sardinella aurita. Data are from 1982 and 1983 cruises across the northern Gulf of Mexico sponsored by the Southeastern Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP). This is the first such examination for these species on a multiyear and gulfwide scale. Bioproflles on reproductive biology, early life history, meristics, adult distribution, and fisheries characteristics are also presented for these species. During the summer, larval Atlantic <b>thread</b> <b>herring</b> and scaled and Spanish sardines were abundant on the inner shelf < 40 m depth), but were rare or absent in deeper waters. Scaled sardine and <b>thread</b> <b>herring</b> were found virtually everywhere inner-shelf waters were sampled, but Spanish sardines were rare in the north-central Gulf. During 1982, larval Atlantic <b>thread</b> <b>herring</b> were the most abundant of the four target c 1 upeid species, whereas Spanish sardine were the most abundant during 1983. On the west Florida shelf, Spanish sardine dominated larval c 1 upeid populations both years.

50|$|Opisthonema, the <b>thread</b> <b>herrings,</b> is a genus of herring {{found in}} {{tropical}} {{waters of the}} Western Hemisphere. They get their name from a filamentous nature of the last ray of the dorsal fin. There are currently five members of this genus.|$|R
50|$|Spanish {{mackerel}} are voracious, opportunistic, carnivores. As {{with other}} members of the genus, food consists mainly of small fishes with lesser quantities of shrimp and squid. Striped anchovies (Engraulidae) and clupeoids such as menhaden, alewives and <b>thread</b> <b>herring</b> (Opisthonema), are particularly important forage in North Carolina, Florida, Texas, and Veracruz. The percentage of anchovies consumed is higher for juveniles than for adults.|$|R
40|$|Learning {{capabilities}} {{of a small}} tropical pelagic fish, the <b>thread</b> <b>herring</b> (#Opisthonema oglinum$), were studied under experimental conditions. The conditioning consisted of associating {{a series of three}} sound pulses with a stress (hoisting a horizontal rigid net from the bottom to the surface). Individual sensibility and school stability measures indicate that fish can be stress-conditioned. Futhermore, these conditioned fish, when mixed with non conditioned fish ("naive" fish), can lead reactions in a school. The results and their influence on fishing are discussed.

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. The {{relationship between the}} distribution of menhaden and selected oceanographic parameters (water color, turbidity, and possibly chlorophyll concentrations) was established. Similar relationships for <b>thread</b> <b>herring</b> were not established nor were relationships relating to the abundance of either species. Use of aircraft and LANDSAT remote sensing instruments to measure or infer a set of basic oceanographic parameters was evaluated. Parameters which could be accurately inferred included surface water temperature, salinity, and color. Water turbidity (Secchi disk) was evaluated as marginally inferrable from the LANDSAT MSS data and chlorophyll-a concentrations as less than marginal. These evaluations considered the parameters only as experienced in the two test areas using available sensors and statistical techniques...|$|R
50|$|In the Gulf of California, they mainly feed on Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) and <b>thread</b> <b>herring</b> (Opisthonema libertate) (about 88%), {{but also}} feed on euphausiids (mostly Nyctiphanes simplex, 11%). They {{have also been}} {{observed}} feeding on pelagic red crabs (Pleuroncodes planipes) off southern Baja California. In the Coral Sea, the South Pacific, and the Indian Ocean, they appear to mainly feed on euphausiids, while off Brazil, they have been observed feeding on sardines. Individuals caught off Western Australia were found with anchovies (E. australis) in their stomachs (though these individuals may refer to Omura's whale). Bryde's whales use several feeding methods, including skimming the surface, lunging, and bubble nets especially within Gulf of Tosa.|$|R
40|$|The {{information}} theory {{approach has been}} widely applied in Mexican fisheries {{in the last few}} years. This Special Issue on “Multi-model inference and model selection in Mexican Fisheries” provides {{the state of the art}} on this topic in Mexico. It includes studies investigating size at sexual maturity (of the shark Rhizoprionodon terraenovae, the <b>thread</b> <b>herring</b> Opisthonema libertate, and the rocky oyster Striostrea prismatica), and growth (of the cuatete Occidentarius platypogon, the gulf corvina Cynoscion othonopterus, the silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis, juvenile blue crabs Callinectes arcuatus, and Cortes Geoduck Panopea globosa). This Special Issue is an important collection of best practice examples in fisheries science, promoting the shift from the single-model approach to the more robust and less restricted by strict assumptions approach of multi-model inference.

40|$|The daily {{periodicity}} of micro-increments in the otoliths of Atlantic <b>thread</b> <b>herring</b> Opisthonema oglinum {{was demonstrated}} from juveniles injected with oxytetracycline and reared {{for up to}} 62 days. Micro-increments ranged from 26 to 358 in the overall sample. Von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) using micro-increment counts were: L-infinity = 337 mm fork length (L-F) (s. e. = 31 mm); K = 1. 2 (s. e. = 0. 2) and t(0) = 0. 04 years (s. e. = 0. 01 years). The otolith-based growth was corroborated using the L-F frequency analysis. Observed lengths of increments were considered unsuitable for VBGF derivation, as no increase in size was obtained from them. Furthermore, the high percentage of unreadable otoliths suggests that increment analysis is unreliable for age estimation. Most growth occurs within the first year, differing from previous longevity estimates of 4 - 8 years. In contrast with published information, O. oglinum is a fast-growing and short-lived species...|$|R

40|$|High {{diversity}} of fish {{along the west}} coast of the Baja California Peninsula is a consequence of strong climatic contrasts between the cool California Current and the warm subtropical California Countercurrent. This favors the distribution of biotas of temperate and tropical affinities belonging to the San Diegan and Panamic Provinces. This work analyzes the specific composition and abundance of fish larvae to characterize their assemblage and seasonal changes in Bahía Magdalena, Baja California Sur, during the first 10 months of the 1997 - 1998 El Niño event. For 46, 229 fish larvae, 105 taxa were grouped into 84 genera of 45 families. During the study period, more than a twofold {{increase in the number of}} species with respect to other studies represents the largest collection to date. Species composition suggests that at least 40 % of the 260 taxa reported as adults had reproductive activity. Two temporally distinct larval fish assemblages were characterized by dominant species with massive spawning, such as Pacific sardine in winter, and mojarras and <b>thread</b> <b>herring</b> in summer. The SST annual cycle, as an indicator of environmental variability, is consistent with the taxonomic change between cool and warm periods...|$|R
