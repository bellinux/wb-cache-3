50|$|To {{enable a}} decoder to present {{synchronized}} content, such as audio tracks matching the associated video, {{at least once}} each 100 ms a Program Clock Reference, or PCR is transmitted in the adaptation field of an MPEG-2 transport stream packet. The PID with the PCR for an MPEG-2 program is identified by the pcr_pid value in the associated Program Map Table. The value of the PCR, when properly used, is employed to generate a system_timing_clock in the decoder. The STC or System Time Clock decoder, when properly implemented, provides a highly accurate time base {{that is used to}} synchronize audio and video elementary streams. Timing in MPEG2 references this clock. For example, the <b>presentation</b> <b>time</b> <b>stamp</b> (PTS) is intended to be relative to the PCR. The first 33 bits are based on a 90 kHz clock. The last 9 are based on a 27 MHz clock. The maximum jitter permitted for the PCR is +/- 500 ns.|$|E

40|$|Video quality {{assessment}} {{is becoming more}} important in current digital video application. Most of the video encoders and decoders focus in providing more visual quality in less amount of digital information, being the compression {{one of the most}} important solutions for making possible the transmission of high quality videos in the current digital transmission media. Sometimes, however, not only video compression is good enough for video quality transmission, maybe the available network bandwidth or the ability to process the video by a low-end processor is not sufficient for continuous playback. Many techniques that consider time variabilities of different sorts need to be developed to keep a digital video watchable. This work focus on a new timeline approach to compare the quality of videos for which a <b>presentation</b> <b>time</b> <b>stamp</b> variability is allowed. Based on video quality metrics already established the new approach can be used to help the decision about the most suitable method for real-time video transmission. Among the many possible techniques able to cope with time stamp variability, one can mention the variable delay time in video presentation, or the use of frame skipping technique, or even more compression applied to reduce the bandwidth and/or processing - improving the perceived video quality under scarce resource availability. A new timeline approach to calculate the current video quality metrics used in most of the encoders and decoders available was developed. This timeline approach takes into account not only the frames themselves, as a frame-by-frame evaluation, but both the frame and <b>presentation</b> <b>time</b> <b>stamp</b> are considered in the proposed approach to the problem. The quality comparison is based on a new discretization, which hopefully serves better the quality of digital video without losing perceptual quality in the process.

40|$|Abstract. In this {{document}} a new <b>time</b> <b>stamping</b> system with linear chaining is presented. It has the characteristic {{that there is}} a symmetric situation between the computation of the <b>time</b> <b>stamp</b> of a given document, and the control of its integrity. This is obtained through the use of of a new “baby step giant step ” algorithm that is introduced and applied. The equation for computing a <b>time</b> <b>stamp,</b> is a variable in the number of older timestamps used to compute the actual one. It is safer than the one used in other methods. It has also the characteristic that it establish a logarithmic link between any <b>time</b> <b>stamp</b> in the cycle and the last one that is characteristic of the cycle. The availability is very high as no intermediate computations are required. The algorithm is named LILO as an abbreviation for linear logarithmic. From its properties it follows that the data for checking a <b>time</b> <b>stamp</b> is logarithmic in volume and is independent of the position of the document in the cycle, whether it be for delivering a <b>time</b> <b>stamp</b> or checking the integrity of a <b>time</b> <b>stamp.</b> Another characteristic of the system is that it has a detection and time localization of attempts to modify timestamps. A generalization using arbitrary arithmetic bases of integers is sketched. ...|$|R
