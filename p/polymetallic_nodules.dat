5|$|Sediments {{of certain}} abyssal plains contain {{abundant}} mineral resources, notably <b>polymetallic</b> <b>nodules.</b> These potato-sized concretions of manganese, iron, nickel, cobalt, and copper, distributed on the seafloor at depths of greater than 4000meters, are of significant commercial interest. The area of maximum commercial interest for polymetallic nodule mining (called the Pacific nodule province) lies in international {{waters of the}} Pacific Ocean, stretching from 118°–157°, and from 9°–16°N, an area of more than 3 million km². The abyssal Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCFZ) is an area within the Pacific nodule province that is currently under exploration for its mineral potential.|$|E

25|$|Manganese nodules are {{expected}} {{to exist in the}} Southern Ocean. Manganese nodules are rock concretions on the sea bottom formed of concentric layers of iron and manganese hydroxides around a core. The core may be microscopically small and is sometimes completely transformed into manganese minerals by crystallization. Interest in the potential exploitation of <b>polymetallic</b> <b>nodules</b> generated a great deal of activity among prospective mining consortia in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E

Seafloor topographic map with 1 meter contour line was produced in two areas of about 20 km 2 each by AUV survey equipped with MBES, SSS and SBP. Photographs, continuously covering the seafloor taken by AUV, together with seafloor topographic map produced from MBES of the AUV enable us to understand detail manner of distribution of <b>polymetallic</b> <b>nodule.</b> By this method, more accurate resource estimation is possible. Furthermore, information of micro-topography helps for designing ore collector...|$|R

2500|$|Deep sea mining is a {{relatively}} new mineral retrieval process that takes place on the ocean floor. Ocean mining sites are usually around large areas of <b>polymetallic</b> <b>nodules</b> or active and extinct hydrothermal vents at about 1,400 – 3,700 meters below the ocean's surface. The vents create sulfide deposits, which contain precious metals such as silver, gold, copper, manganese, cobalt, and zinc. The deposits are mined using either hydraulic pumps or bucket systems that take ore to the surface to be processed. As with all mining operations, deep sea mining raises questions about environmental damages to the surrounding areas ...|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} the dual role is a project on <b>polymetallic</b> <b>nodules</b> that has been {{sponsored}} by the Government of India at the institute for well over 25 years. By the late 1970s the government had decided that the country needed to enhance its resources of minerals of strategic interest. NIO was given the responsibility of exploring the oceans for this purpose. On 26 January 1981, NIO hauled up <b>polymetallic</b> <b>nodules</b> from a depth of 4,800 m in the western Indian Ocean using its first research vessel, RV Gaveshani, which was acquired in 1976.|$|E
50|$|<b>Polymetallic</b> <b>nodules</b> were {{discovered}} in 1868 in the Kara Sea, in the Arctic Ocean of Siberia. During the scientific expeditions of the HMS Challenger (1872-1876), they were found to occur in most oceans of the world.|$|E

50|$|<b>Polymetallic</b> <b>nodules</b> have {{economically}} valuable metals such as Copper, Cobalt, Nickel and Manganese in {{them and}} are viewed as potential resources {{to take care of}} the depleting land resources and increasing demand of these metals. There are 380 million tons of nodules in the retained Indian Pioneer area. However development of deep subsea technology for mining these resources is a major challenge considering the ultra high pressure environment, very soft soils and other factors. NIOT has been working on a mining concept where a crawler based mining machine collects, crushes and pumps nodules to the mother ship using a positive displacement pump through a flexible riser system. It is expected that multiple mining machines will cover the mining field during large scale commercial mining operations. With this perspective, the integrated mining system is under development for demonstration of deep-sea mining of <b>polymetallic</b> <b>nodules.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Nodules lie on {{the seabed}} sediment, often partly or {{completely}} buried. They vary greatly in abundance, in some cases touching one another and covering more than 70% of the sea floor.

50|$|The Authority's main {{legislative}} accomplishment to {{date has}} been the adoption, in the year 2000, of regulations governing exploration for <b>polymetallic</b> <b>nodules.</b> These resources, also called manganese nodules, contain varying amounts of manganese, cobalt, copper and nickel.

50|$|Research {{shows that}} <b>polymetallic</b> <b>nodule</b> fields are {{hotspots}} of abundance and diversity for a highly vulnerable abyssal fauna. Nodule mining could affect {{tens of thousands}} of square kilometers of these deep sea ecosystems. Nodule regrowth takes decades to millions of years and that would make such mining an unsustainable and nonrenewable practice. Any prediction about the effects of mining is extremely uncertain. Thus, nodule mining could cause habitat alteration, direct mortality of benthic creatures, or suspension of sediment, which can smother filter feeders.Future environmental impact studies should address the impact on disruption and release of methane clathrate deposits in the deep oceans.|$|R
50|$|Odunton has {{had more}} than 20 years of {{experience}} in the International Civil Service, with progressively increased responsibilities in marine resource policy formulation, particularly marine mineral resources. Since the establishment of the Authority in 1996 he has concurrently held several positions there at the policy-making level, as Deputy to the Secretary-General, head of the ISA Office of Resources and Environmental Monitoring, Interim Director-General of the Enterprise (the Authority’s seabed mining arm, not yet operational) and Secretary of the Authority’s Assembly. He has conceptualized and convened technical workshops of the Authority, on topics such as deep-seabed <b>polymetallic</b> <b>nodule</b> exploration, the development of environmental guidelines, and proposed technologies for deep-seabed mining of nodules.|$|R
50|$|Research {{shows that}} <b>polymetallic</b> <b>nodule</b> fields are {{hotspots}} of abundance and diversity for a highly vulnerable abyssal fauna. Because {{deep sea mining}} {{is a relatively new}} field, the complete consequences of full scale mining operations on this ecosystem are unknown. However, some researchers have said they believe that removal of parts of the sea floor will result in disturbances to the benthic layer, increased toxicity of the water column and sediment plumes from tailings. Removing parts of the sea floor could disturb the habitat of benthic organisms, with unknown long-term effects. Aside from the direct impact of mining the area, some researchers and environmental activists have raised concerns about leakage, spills and corrosion that could alter the mining area’s chemical makeup.|$|R
