50|$|A tree <b>planting</b> <b>bar</b> or dibble bar {{is a tool}} used by foresters {{to plant}} trees, {{especially}} in large-scale afforestation or reforestation. It is very ergonomic, as it greatly speeds up the planting and prevents back pain.|$|E
5000|$|Forestation is the {{establishment}} of forest growth on areas that either had forest or lacked it. Reforestation and afforestation are categories of forestation. Many governments and non-governmental organizations directly engage in programs of afforestation to create forests, increase carbon capture and carbon sequestration, and help to anthropogenically improve biodiversity. (In the UK, afforestation may mean converting {{the legal status of}} some land to [...] "royal forest".) Special tools, e.g. tree <b>planting</b> <b>bar,</b> are used to make planting of trees easier and faster.|$|E

40|$|With the {{increasing}} emphasis on productivity enhancement in agriculture/horticulture/forestry sectors precision in every field method {{is of utmost}} importance. To realize the productive potential of every plant in the field accuracy in spacing is essentially required so that crop plants can grow without competing with one another for nutrients, water, sunlight or space. This article aims at offering simple technique based on locally developed field tool called Multiple Nursery <b>Planting</b> <b>Bar</b> (MNPB) to get necessary precision in maintaining spacing while planting medicinal plants especially Mushakbala (Valeriana jatamansi), Atish (Aconitum heterophyllum) and Kutki (Picrorhiza kurrooa).

40|$|Vegetation {{was added}} to a fully {{developed}} sandy point bar in the meander of a constructed stream. Significant changes in the flow structure and bed topography were observed. As expected, the addition of vegetative resistance decreased the depth-averaged streamwise velocity over the bar and increased it in the open region. In addition, the secondary circulation increased in strength but became confined to the deepest section of the channel. Over the point bar, the secondary flow was entirely outward, i. e., toward the outer bank. The changes in flow led to changes in bar shape. Although {{the region of the}} bar closest to the inner bank accumulated sediment, erosion of the bar and the removal of plants by scouring were observed at the interface between the <b>planted</b> <b>bar</b> and the open channel.

40|$|Abstract. We analyze {{existing}} masonry arch-bridges {{and corresponding}} reinforcement methods {{in this paper}} and bring about the method of using strip-shaped outer-wrap reinforced concrete with chemically <b>planted</b> <b>bar</b> to improve the new and old concrete’s cooperative work so as to strengthen the wholeness and improve impermeability of the bridge. We also compare two experiments on one actual bridge of 30 cm strip-shaped outer-wrap reinforced concrete in the main arch ring and 20 cm global outer-wrap reinforcement concrete, of which the data shows the superiority of strip-shaped outer-wrap reinforced concrete for it strengthens both the bridge floor and bottom structure and improve the load capacity. Foreword Masonry arch-bridges have many advantages, such as convenience in drawing raw material, steel and concrete saving, large load capacity, easy-got technique, simple structure, good durability and low maintenance costs. [1] During the time from 1950 s to 1980 s, masonry arch-bridges came into large-scale applications in China. According to related statistic data, China has the biggest number of arch-bridges {{in the world and}} arch-bridges make the biggest share in all the existent bridges in China...|$|R

50|$|Investigating the vaults, {{and quickly}} ruling as {{impossible}} the actual removal of many tonnes of gold via a narrow tunnel {{in the time}} available, Holmes swiftly determines what has taken place; based on {{the speed of the}} lift's descent, it should take them 45 seconds to reach the vaults, but they stopped after only 42 seconds. From this, Holmes deduces that Moriarty had an empty, duplicate vault built a few meters above the real one, subsequently <b>planting</b> iron <b>bars</b> to stop the lift reaching the real vault. While everyone puzzled over how the bars of gold were stolen from the false vault, Moriarty would actually be stealing them from the real one below.

While the CNT was the leading organization in Catalonia, it often shared power with the UGT.

40|$|In this paper, a {{mathematical}} model of the thermal power plants TENT A and TENT B, developed for voltage and reactive power control simulation purposes, is presented. The model is developed using the Simulink/Matlab program platform. All important elements, such as synchronous generator, step-up transformer, turbine and governor, excitation system, automatic voltage regulator (ARN) and the network, connected to the power <b>plant's</b> bus <b>bars,</b> are modelled with the complexity level required for studying the problems of interest. In the first part, {{a review of the}} hierarchical voltage control in the system is given, because the coordinated reactive power regulator (GRRS) has to be embedded in future processes of voltage control automatisation on higher levels and 'smart' control in the power system. For the needs of studying the HV bus bars voltage control, as well as reactive power allocation within the power plant in manual and automatic control mode, a series of simulations was performed. For verification purposes, the simulation results are compared to the on-site measurements. An excellent match of simulated and recorded results is achieved...|$|R
40|$|The {{time and}} space {{assembly}} line balancing problem (TSALBP) is a re- alistic multiobjective version of assembly line balancing industrial problems in- volving the joint optimization of conflicting criteria such as the cycle time, the number of stations, and the area of these stations. For this family of problems there is not any repository where researchers and practitioners can o bt ain realistic problem instances also containing information on mixed products plans. In this contribution we introduce a new TSALBP instance software generator that can produce problem instances having industrial real-like features.
