Typically, plastics multi layers exhibit a migration behaviour which is different from mono layer plastics and which is characterized by a delayed migration profile. As a natural consequence, the question needs to be addressed as to whether currently applied migration test conditions are still applicable for multi layers. It appears that migration test conditions should be adapted to the requirements coming from multi layer migration characteristics.

In this paper, examples of experimental results obtained in this project are given and the concluded migration testing concept is presented...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMost food {{packages}} and food contact materials are manufactured using adhesives. The EU regulates all food contact materials, as their constituents may not contaminate food and endanger consumer's health. In contrary to plastics which are regulated by <b>positive</b> <b>lists</b> of authorised ingredients, adhesives {{have not yet}} a specific regulation.

40|$|Food {{is a big}} {{business}} in the EU and nanofood products are beginning {{to be placed on}} the market. It is still unclear whether the absence of minimum regulation at a global level promotes or prevents the growth of a market in nanofood. However, the development of an adequate risk management policy in relation to food safety is a key concern for consumers. Importantly, the European Parliament in its 2009 Resolution on “Legal aspects on nanomaterials” called for more in-depth scientific research on the toxicity of compounds in nanomaterials, and for the adoption of an EU definition of nanomaterials for regulatory purposes. Unfortunately, in 2011, nanotechnology led to inconclusive debates {{in the context of the}} revision of Novel Food Regulation. General Food Law applies to nanofood in terms of safety requirements, and specific rules also apply to food contact materials containing nanoparticles as well as to to additives, vitamins and minerals. The EU legislator also introduced mandatory labelling in respect of products derived from nanotechnologies. The legal framework is evolving according to the so-called “incremental approach”, a governance model that creates the risk of fragmentation. But the main problem is the inconsistent definition of the terms “nanotechnology” and “nanomaterials” when looking at the enforcement of regulations and the provision of a wide range of specific tools for different nanofoods: for example the use of <b>positive</b> <b>lists</b> of authorised substances applying only to food contact materials, additives and supplements.

Currently discussed options for climate change mitigation under the FCCC include land-use, land-use change and forestry activities, which can have both positive or negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems. On the other hand, activities undertaken under the CBD can {{have an impact on the}} ability of ecosystems to provide climate-relevant services like carbon sequestration, regulation of N 2 O and CH 4 emissions, water cycling and the energy budget. Synergies between climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation can be reached in the areas of conservation of old-growth forests and wetlands. Clear conflicts could arise e. g. from the introduction of exotic species for carbon sequestration, the construction of hydroelectric dams or from the implementation of so-called 'hard' adaptation technologies under the Kyoto Protocol. Most mitigation and adaptation activities discussed under the Kyoto Protocol, however, have ambivalent effects on biodiversity and climate-relevant processes that depend largely on the ecosystem type and the management practices chosen. The report discusses instruments such as guidelines, indicators, impact assessments, <b>positive</b> <b>lists</b> or participation of stakeholders that could promote the consistence between climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation.

40|$|Two studies {{investigated}} {{the role of}} mental imagery in recall of a target 2 ̆ 7 s behaviors. The studies also explored {{whether there was a}} direct effect of imagery or an indirect effect (mediated through recall) on impressions of the target. An overriding question of this research was whether three imagery variables (encoding strategy, concreteness of information, and ability to form vivid images) would have additive or interactive effects on recall and impressions. Encoding strategy was manipulated by asking participants in both studies, to either make trait inferences, comprehend information, or form images of the behaviors described to them. In both studies the concreteness of the descriptions presented to participants was a within-subject manipulation. In Study 1, participants read either lists of concrete positive descriptions and abstract negative descriptions or of concrete negative and abstract positive descriptions of a target. In Study 2, participants read concrete descriptions of behaviors whose meanings were each qualified by abstract information. In Study 1, the participants who read the concrete <b>positive</b> <b>lists</b> remembered more concrete descriptions and had more positive impressions of the target than those who read the concrete negative lists. Analyses confirmed that there was both a direct and indirect effect of concreteness on impressions. The concreteness effects on recall and impressions were significant only in the comprehend encoding task condition. In Study 2, participants recalled more concrete than abstract information overall, but were more influenced by the abstract information that provided the evaluative meaning of the concrete behaviors than by the concrete characteristics of the behaviors. The possible effect on memory and impressions of an ability to form vivid imagery was also examined in both studies. All the results are discussed and interpreted from an imagery perspective. Their implications for insights into the previous findings in the social vividness literature are described. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{general picture}} of {{toxicological}} approach and practical aspects of cosmetic safety {{is described in}} this thesis. Such considerations are the basis for introducing negative and <b>positive</b> <b>lists</b> of cosmetic ingredients into cosmetic legislation. The first Dutch Cosmetic Act of 1968 already has several of these lists, but no analytical methods were given to control these lists. Therefore a study has been started with the aim to make analytical market surveys of several classes of potentially risk-bearing compounds. The analytical experience gained in the study {{can be used for}} the developments of official methods for the Dutch Cosmetic Act. The results of these market surveys can moreover be used as information on the actual use of risk-bearing compounds and will therefore contribute to the establishment of sound and significant cosmetic legislation in the Netherlands. Eye make-up colours were identified by a set of characteristic reactions. Lipstick colours were identified by wellknown chromategraphic methods. Colour intermediates for the oxidative hair colouring were identified by two-dimensional thin- layer chromatography. The aromatic amines were confirmed by direct gaschromatographic analysis which permitted quantitative determination. A separation of phenolic intermediates by means of gaschromatography is also described. Suntan preparations were analysed for the presence of UV-absorbers, browning agents and local anesthesics. A simple aerosol sampling method, prior to gaschromatographic analysis was developed, thus permitting a total analysis of propellants and solvents in single-phase aerosols within an hour. Hormonal substances were detected in selected samples by chromatographic methods. These chemical findings supported the results of the biological assay for the detection of oestrogenic and androgenic activity of cosmetic products. Finally antimicrobial compounds were analysed in many kinds of cosmetic products, in which they were used for preservation or for its deodorizing, antidandruff or antiseptic actions. The diversity in chemical structure did not allow the development of universal methods, but most of the compounds could be identified and determined by chromatographic methods. Formaldehyde was determined by fluorometry. A study of the stability of formaldehyde releasing substances is presented. ...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to explore the efficiency of two regulatory options in the context of a global commitment to gradually phase-out the use of mercury-added products. In the first case no mercury-added products would be allowed unless they are listed in an annex (the negative list), while in the second case all mercury-added products would be allowed unless they are listed in an annex (the <b>positive</b> <b>list).</b> In both cases countries may have time to make the transition away from these products through the use of exemptions. The paper provides first a conceptual discussion of bans as regulatory instruments and of the use of technology-forcing standards to attain deep reductions in the use of hazardous substances, and we outline a simple theoretical framework within which the above regulatory options for mercury-added products can be analyzed. This framework is employed to analyze some important pros and cons of the negative and the <b>positive</b> <b>list</b> approaches. Specifically, we address a number of factors that may differ across the two options, such as: (a) the potential presence of different types of information inefficiencies; (b) the flexibility in compliance measures granted by the two approaches; (c) the significance of administration costs as well as other relevant policy implementation issues. The analysis indicates that the negative list approach could facilitate a more cost-effective phase-out of mercury, in part since in this case an individual country seeking exemption would bear the burden of identifying the need for the exemption. With the <b>positive</b> <b>list</b> approach it would be more difficult to induce mercury users to reveal their true costs of substituting to other substances.

50|$|In the 20th century, the {{improvement}} of chemical analysis {{and the development of}} trials to identify the toxic features of substances added to foods led to the replacement of the negative lists by lists of substances allowed to be used for the production and {{the improvement}} of foods. This principle is called a <b>positive</b> <b>listing,</b> and almost all recent legislations are based on it. <b>Positive</b> <b>listing</b> implies that substances meant for human consumption have been tested for their safety, and that they have to meet specified purity criteria prior to their approval by the corresponding authorities. In 1962, the first EU directive (62/2645/EEC) approved 36 colorants, of which 20 were naturally derived and 16 were synthetic. This directive did not list which food products the colorants could or could not be used in. At that time, each member state could designate where certain colors could and could not be used. In Germany, for example, quinoline yellow was allowed in puddings and desserts, but tartrazine was not. The reverse was true in France. This was updated in 1989 with 89/107/EEC, which concerned food additives authorized for use in foodstuffs.|$|R

40|$|Certified {{emission}} reductions (CERs) from Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) {{projects have}} traditionally {{served as an}} indirect link between cap and trade systems around the world. However, since 2010, import restrictions have increased. Reasons for import limitations include the supplementarity principle, genuine concerns about the environmental integrity of CERs and social benefits of CDM projects, pressure from domestic emissions mitigation industries, concerns about competition in the industries in which reductions take place, {{as well as the}} attempt to pressure advanced developing countries to accept national emissions commitments under a future international climate policy regime. It is shown that import limitations lead to a decrease in CER prices and a race to generate CERs as quickly as possible. Such effects are visible in the CDM market after the EU announced its import limitations. The exclusion of CERs from specific project types will distort the CDM supply curve and increase the CER price unless the marginal abatement costs of the excluded project type are above the CER world market price. Similarly, exclusion of CERs from specific host countries will increase the price. Substantial differences are found in CER access to national carbon markets around the world. Policy relevanceCDM regulators could try to improve access of CERs to cap and trade schemes through improvements to additionality testing, standardizing baseline and monitoring methodologies and stakeholder consultation. However, regulators should be aware that standardization is no panacea, and controversies may resurface if standardized additionality determination (e. g. through benchmarks or <b>positive</b> <b>lists)</b> are applied for a certain period and found to be problematic. However, domestic policy concerns such as an unwillingness to send money abroad to buy credits, an inability to control market prices, and competitiveness impacts cannot be resolved by CDM reforms. If, despite such reforms of the CDM, blatant protectionism continues, a challenge before the World Trade Organisation (WTO) could be launched to stop discrimination of service exports from specific countries...|$|E
40|$|The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is {{the first}} and {{by far the largest}} carbon offset {{instrument}} in the world. To date, it is the only market based on an environmental commodity which managed to attract several billions of euros of private capital on an annual basis. Being the first-of-a-kind climate change mitigation instrument, the CDM followed a "learning by doing" pattern undergoing numerous reforms throughout its more than 10 -year history. Although the post- 2012 fate of the mechanism remains uncertain, one should not "throw out the baby with the bath water" as the lessons from the CDM experience may be useful not only for the CDM reform but also for new market instruments. One of the widely discussed topics is the economic efficiency of the CDM. Despite being largely concentrated on the supply side (93 % of all issued credits come from 5 countries), the CDM provided a useful ―search tool‖ to identify new greenhouse gas abatement opportunities although in most cases failed to scale them up across the economies. The lion’s share of the demand for carbon offsets comes from the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), where the CDM helped companies save millions of euros by reducing emissions where it was the cheapest. With the quantitative restrictions in place, the demand for CDM offsets from projects registered after 2012 will likely dwindle to a few public buyers, dwarfed by the size of supply. The CDM has also raised criticism regarding its environmental integrity. For example, there is strong evidence that HFC- 23 destruction projects provided perverse incentives for installations to engage in strategic behavior. Besides, there are concerns over the additionality of some large renewable energy projects, in particular in China and India. The transparency of the framework has allowed identifying loopholes and implementing the reforms that have been ongoing since the inception of the CDM. Finally, the evaluations of the contribution of the CDM to sustainable development are mixed and largely depend on the project type and national circumstances. The principle of national sovereignty dominates the existing sustainability assessment which fully rests on the host country without any standardized criteria or monitoring. These issues have been and keep being addressed in reforms that have not ceased since the inception of the CDM. The gradual introduction of more stringent baselines {{has been one of the}} tools used to reinforce environmental integrity. Standardized baselines and <b>positive</b> <b>lists</b> help simplify and speed up the registration of projects, and hence the scaling up of local projects. This paper reviews the CDM’s achievements and challenges and derives 10 key lessons that should be taken into account while reforming the mechanism as well as while designing new instruments to tackle climate change. As the Green Climate Fund is still wondering how to raise the pledged 100 billion dollars until 2020, the CDM recipe for attracting private investments in the billions of euros per year to climate action is worth some attention...|$|E
