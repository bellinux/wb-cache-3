5|$|The spring {{contacts}} in the connectors eventually relax and wear out with repeated cycles of <b>plugging</b> and unplugging. The lifetime of a type-A plug is approximately 1,500 connect/disconnect cycles.|$|E
5|$|While {{connector}} interfaces can {{be designed}} to allow <b>plugging</b> with either orientation, the original design omitted such functionality to decrease manufacturing costs.

5|$|Inside the case, {{there were}} many more {{similarities}} with the ZX81. Like its successor, it used the Z80A microprocessor and had only 1KB of on-board RAM. It came with a specially written BASIC interpreter on a dedicated ROM chip and could use a television as a display. It relied on an ordinary cassette tape recorder for data storage. The main {{difference between the two}} machines lay in the internal software; when the ZX81 was released, ZX80 owners were able to upgrade by the relatively simple expedient of <b>plugging</b> a new ROM onto the circuit board.|$|E
30|$|In the {{vibratory}} sleeve penetration process, {{there are}} three degrees of soil <b>plug</b> inside the sleeve, namely the unplugged, partially <b>plugged</b> and fully <b>plugged.</b> When the soil <b>plug</b> is fully <b>plugged,</b> the soil <b>plug</b> doesn’t slide along the sleeve wall. Hence, the open-end piles in fully <b>plugged</b> mode behave like closed-end piles.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Osteochondral {{autologous}} transplantation {{is used for}} the treatment of full-thickness articular cartilage lesions of a joint. Press-fit stability is an important factor for good survival of the transplanted <b>plugs.</b> MATERIAL AND METHODS: 36 <b>plugs</b> of three different lengths were transplanted in fresh-frozen human knees. On one condyle, 3 <b>plugs</b> were exactly matched to the depth of the recipient site ("bottomed" <b>plugs)</b> and on the opposite condyle 3 <b>plugs</b> were 5 mm shorter than the depth of the recipient site ("unbottomed" <b>plugs).</b> <b>Plugs</b> were left protruding and then pushed in until flush, and then to 2 mm below flush level, using a loading apparatus. RESULTS: Longer <b>plugs</b> needed higher forces to begin displacement. At flush level, bottomed <b>plugs</b> needed significantly higher forces than unbottomed <b>plugs</b> to become displaced below flush level (mean forces of 404 N and 131 N, respectively). Shorter bottomed <b>plugs</b> required higher forces than longer bottomed ones. INTERPRETATION: Bottomed <b>plugs</b> generally provide much more stability than unbottomed ones. Short bottomed <b>plugs</b> are more stable than long bottomed <b>plugs.</b> Thus, in clinical practice it is advisable to use short bottomed <b>plugs.</b> If, however, unbottomed <b>plugs</b> are still chosen, the longer the <b>plug</b> the higher the resulting stability will be because of higher frictional forces...|$|R
5|$|As {{he makes}} his way further down the city, Foster {{eventually}} arrives in the abandoned subway tunnels. There he discovers that LINC has grown exponentially, {{to the point where he}} is now half-machine, half-organic entity. However, in order to function, LINC needs a human host to share its brain. The current host is Foster's biological father, who is old and has become severely worn out from his symbiosis with LINC. It is revealed that LINC sent for Foster because, with the death of its current host inevitable, it needed a replacement, and only a blood relative would do. Foster ultimately defeats LINC by <b>plugging</b> Joey (now calling himself Ken) into the mainframe. Joey/Ken is able to take control of the system, and he and Foster set about turning Union City into a utopia.|$|E
5|$|Springfield is in {{the midst}} of a massive heat wave. Every {{building}} in the town has installed a large air conditioning device. However, this draws a lot of power from the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Despite the safety measures Mr. Burns has taken (cutting power to the orphanage), the plant is at full power. At home, without an air conditioning device, the Simpsons have to follow an old-fashioned fan. Homer decides to give them a taste of winter by <b>plugging</b> in his dancing Santa Claus. This overloads the plant and causes a town-wide blackout. Eventually, widespread rioting and looting occur. The police try to intervene, but are powerless to stop the massive crime wave.|$|E
5|$|Difficulties {{with the}} {{diffusers}} and pumps paled into insignificance besides {{those with the}} porous barrier. In order to work, the gaseous diffusion process required a barrier with microscopic holes, but not subject to <b>plugging.</b> It had to be extremely porous, but strong enough to handle the high pressures. And, like everything else, it had to resist corrosion from uranium hexafluoride. The latter criterion suggested a nickel barrier. Foster C. Nix at the Bell Telephone Laboratories experimented with nickel powder, while Edward O. Norris at the C. O. Jelliff Manufacturing Corporation and Edward Adler at the City College of New York worked on a design with electroplated metallic nickel. Norris was an English interior decorator, who had developed a very fine metal mesh for use with a spray gun. Their design appeared too brittle and fragile for the proposed use, particularly on the higher stages of enrichment, but there was hope {{that this could be}} overcome.|$|E

50|$|Glow <b>plugs</b> have {{a limited}} {{lifetime}} and users are advised to have several replacement <b>plugs</b> on hand. Replacement <b>plugs</b> must be the correct type; <b>plugs</b> for turbo engines are not compatible with <b>plugs</b> for standard engines. The <b>plugs</b> should be tightened a quarter-turn past a snug fit to avoid over-tightening. Glow <b>plugs,</b> like all incandescent objects, are extremely hot, and glow <b>plugs</b> should never be removed when hot. Likewise, {{care must be taken}} when fueling because a hot glow <b>plug</b> can ignite fuel. Overheating of the battery can also be dangerous and only well-made connectors should be used.|$|R

5|$|In 1943, Urey {{brought in}} Hugh S. Taylor from Princeton University {{to look at}} the problem of a usable barrier. Libby made {{progress}} on understanding the chemistry of uranium hexafluoride, leading to ideas on how to prevent corrosion and <b>plugging.</b> Chemical researchers at the SAM Laboratories studied fluorocarbons, which resisted corrosion, and could be used as lubricants and coolants in the gaseous diffusion plant. Despite this progress, the K-25 Project was in serious trouble without a suitable barrier, and by August 1943 it was facing cancellation. On 13 August Groves informed the Military Policy Committee, the senior committee that steered the Manhattan Project, that gaseous diffusion enrichment in excess of 50 percent was probably infeasible, and that the gaseous diffusion plant would be limited to producing product with a lower enrichment that could be fed into the calutrons of the Y-12 electromagnetic plant. Urey therefore began preparations to mass-produce the Norris-Adler barrier, despite its problems.|$|E
5|$|This shift by Timex came at {{an ideal}} time for Sinclair. The ZX80 had proved {{more popular than}} {{expected}} and Sinclair's existing manufacturer, a small electronics company in St Ives, lacked the resources {{to deal with the}} demand. Timex took over production of the ZX80 late in 1980. The arrangement worked well for both companies and Timex took on the manufacture of the ZX81, aided by capital investment in its Dundee plant. Sinclair initially planned to produce 10,000 ZX81s a month, rising to 30,000 a month within a year. However, Timex initially had significant problems in producing enough ZX81s to satisfy demand. As a consequence, it took up to nine weeks for ZX81s to be delivered by mail order. It was not until September 1981, five months after the launch of the ZX81, that the delivery times finally came down to the promised twenty-eight days. Those who already owned or had recently ordered the ZX80 were not excluded; anyone who had ordered a ZX80 in the two weeks before the ZX81's launch would receive the newer machine, while existing owners were able to upgrade their ZX80s by <b>plugging</b> an extra £20 ROM chip into the circuit board.|$|E
