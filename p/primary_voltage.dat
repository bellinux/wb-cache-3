5|$|The tower's {{electrical}} service was supplied by Consolidated Edison (ConEd) at 13,800volts. The electricity {{passed through the}} World Trade Center Primary Distribution Center (PDC), and was then sent up the building's core to electrical substations located on the mechanical floors. The substations lowered the 13,800 <b>primary</b> <b>voltage</b> to 480/277volts, and the voltage was then further lowered to 208/120volts for general power and lighting services. The complex was also served by emergency generators located in the sub-levels of the towers and {{on the roof of}} Five World Trade Center.|$|E
2500|$|The second formula {{above is}} derived from the first using the {{resonance}} condition [...] Since the capacitance of the secondary coil is very small compared to the primary capacitor, the <b>primary</b> <b>voltage</b> is stepped up to a high value.|$|E
2500|$|The {{oscillating}} {{magnetic field}} of the primary winding induces an oscillating current in the secondary winding (L2), by Faraday's law of induction. Over a number of cycles, the energy in the primary circuit is transferred to the secondary. The total energy in the tuned circuits {{is limited to the}} energy originally stored in the capacitor C1, so as the oscillating voltage in the secondary increases in amplitude ("ring up") the oscillations in the primary decrease to zero ("ring down"). Although the ends of the secondary coil are open, it also acts as a tuned circuit due to the capacitance (C2), the sum of the parasitic capacitance between the turns of the coil plus the capacitance of the toroid electrode E. Current flows rapidly back and forth through the secondary coil between its ends. Because of the small capacitance, the oscillating voltage across the secondary coil which appears on the output terminal is much larger than the <b>primary</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{potential}} of the secondary voltage now flips to negative in the following manner. The collapsing flux induces primary current to flow out of the primary toward the now-open switch i.e. to flow {{in the same direction}} it was flowing when the switch was closed. For current to flow out of the switch-end of the primary, the <b>primary</b> <b>voltage</b> at the switch end must be positive relative to its other end that is at the supply voltage Vb. But this represents a <b>primary</b> <b>voltage</b> opposite in polarity to what it was during the time when the switch was closed: during Tclosed, the switch-end of the primary was approximately zero and therefore negative relative to the supply end; now during Topen it has become positive relative to Vb.|$|E
50|$|A {{so-called}} ultra-linear {{push-pull amplifier}} uses either pentodes or tetrodes with their screen grid fed from {{a percentage of}} the <b>primary</b> <b>voltage</b> on the output transformer. This gives efficiency and distortion that is a good compromise between triode (or triode-strapped) power amplifier circuits and conventional pentode or tetrode output circuits where the screen is fed from a relatively constant voltage source.|$|E
50|$|As in a two-winding transformer, {{the ratio}} of {{secondary}} to <b>primary</b> <b>voltages</b> is equal to {{the ratio of}} the number of turns of the winding they connect to. For example, connecting the load between the middle and bottom of the autotransformer will reduce the voltage by 50%. Depending on the application, that portion of the winding used solely in the higher-voltage (lower current) portion may be wound with wire of a smaller gauge, though the entire winding is directly connected.|$|R

2500|$|Modern {{transistor}} or {{vacuum tube}} Tesla coils {{do not use}} a primary spark gap. Instead, the transistor(s) or vacuum tube(s) provide the switching or amplifying function necessary to generate RF power for the primary circuit. Solid-state Tesla coils use the lowest <b>primary</b> operating <b>voltage,</b> typically between 155 and 800 volts, and drive the primary winding using either a single, half-bridge, or full-bridge arrangement of bipolar transistors, MOSFETs or IGBTs to switch the primary current. Vacuum tube coils typically operate with plate voltages between 1500 and 6000 volts, while most spark gap coils operate with <b>primary</b> <b>voltages</b> of 6,000 to 25,000 volts. The primary winding of a traditional transistor Tesla coil is wound around only the bottom portion of the secondary coil. This configuration illustrates operation of the secondary as a pumped resonator. The <b>primary</b> 'induces' alternating <b>voltage</b> into the bottom-most portion of the secondary, providing regular 'pushes' (similar to providing properly timed pushes to a playground swing). Additional energy is transferred from the primary to the secondary inductance and top-load capacitance during each [...] "push", and secondary output voltage builds (called 'ring-up'). An electronic feedback circuit is usually used to adaptively synchronize the primary oscillator to the growing resonance in the secondary, {{and this is the}} only tuning consideration beyond the initial choice of a reasonable top-load.|$|R
5000|$|An {{autotransformer}} has {{a single}} winding with two end terminals, and one or more terminals at intermediate tap points, or it is a transformer in which the primary and secondary coils have part of, or all of their turns in common. The <b>primary</b> <b>voltage</b> is applied across two of the terminals, and the secondary voltage taken from two terminals, almost always having one terminal {{in common with the}} <b>primary</b> <b>voltage.</b> The primary and secondary circuits therefore have a number of windings turns in common. Since the volts-per-turn is the same in both windings, each develops a voltage in proportion to its number of turns. In an autotransformer part of the current flows directly from the input to the output, and only part is transferred inductively, allowing a smaller, lighter, cheaper core to be used as well as requiring only a single winding. However the voltage and current ratio of autotransformers can be formulated the same as other two-winding transformers: ...|$|E
50|$|There is a {{capacitor}} (sometimes called a condenser) connected across the points. If the capacitor were missing or defective, the primary current would arc across the opening points allowing {{the current and}} therefore the magnetic field to collapse slowly causing a weak or no spark. When the points begin to open the primary current is diverted to charge the capacitor, checking {{the rate at which}} the <b>primary</b> <b>voltage</b> rises and limiting the arcing.|$|E
5000|$|Now {{that the}} switch has opened at Topen, the {{magnetizing}} current {{in the primary}} is Ipeak,m = Vp×Tclosed/Lp, and the energy Up is stored in this [...] "magnetizing" [...] field as created by Ipeak,m (energy Um = 1/2×Lp×Ipeak,m2). But {{now there is no}} <b>primary</b> <b>voltage</b> (Vb) to sustain further increases in the magnetic field, or even a steady-state field, the switch being opened and thereby removing the <b>primary</b> <b>voltage.</b> The magnetic field (flux) begins to collapse, and the collapse forces energy back into the circuit by inducing current and voltage into the primary turns, the secondary turns, or both. Induction into the primary will be via the primary turns through which all the flux passes (represented by primary inductance Lp); the collapsing flux creates <b>primary</b> <b>voltage</b> that forces current to continue to flow either out of the primary toward the (now-open) switch or into a primary load such as an LED or a Zener diode, etc. Induction into the secondary will be via the secondary turns through which the mutual (linked) flux passes; this induction causes voltage to appear at the secondary, and if this voltage is not blocked (e.g. by a diode or by the very high impedance of a FET gate), secondary current will flow into the secondary circuit (but in the opposite direction). In any case, if there are no components to absorb the current, the voltage at the switch rises very fast. Without a primary load {{or in the case of}} very limited secondary current the voltage will be limited only by the distributed capacitances of the windings (the so-called interwinding capacitance), and it can destroy the switch. When only interwinding capacitance and a tiny secondary load is present to absorb the energy, very high-frequency oscillations occur, and these [...] "parasitic oscillations" [...] represent a possible source of electromagnetic interference.|$|E

40|$|A set-up for the {{measurement}} of the frequency response of voltage measurement transformers under actual waveform conditions is presented. It {{is based on a}} two steps procedure that makes use of high voltage gas insulated capacitors and a digital bridge. It allows calibrations using distorted waveforms, with a fundamental tone at medium voltage level and superimposed harmonics up to 20 % and 15 kHz. Standard uncertainty in {{the measurement}} of the voltage transformer error is estimated 200 V/V for the ratio error and 300 µrad for the phase displacement up to 15 kHz. First applications to the frequency calibration of voltage measurement transformers with different rated <b>primary</b> <b>voltages</b> up to 50 kV are presented...|$|R
40|$|A high current, high voltage, all {{solid-state}} pulse modulator {{has been}} developed {{for use in the}} Plasma Electrode Pockels Cell (PEPC) subsystem in the National Ignition Facility. The MOSFET-switched pulse generator, designed to be a more capable plug-in replacement for the thyratron-switched units currently deployed in NIF, offers unprecedented capabilities including burst-mode operation, pulse width agility and a steady-state pulse repetition frequency exceeding 1 Hz. Capable of delivering requisite fast risetime, 17 kV flattop pulses into a 6 {Omega} load, the pulser employs a modular architecture characteristic of the inductive adder technology, pioneered at LLNL for use in acceleration applications, which keeps <b>primary</b> <b>voltages</b> low (and well within the capabilities of existing FET technology), reduces fabrication costs and is amenable to rapid assembly and quick field repairs...|$|R
5000|$|Utility poles are {{commonly}} used to carry two types of electric power lines: distribution lines (or [...] "feeders") and subtransmission lines. Distribution lines carry power from local substations to customers. They generally carry voltages from 4.6 to 33 kilovolts (kV) for distances up to 30 miles, and include transformers to step the voltage down from the <b>primary</b> <b>voltage</b> to the lower secondary voltage used by the customer. A service drop carries this lower voltage to the customer's premises.|$|E
50|$|Electrical {{service to}} the towers was {{supplied}} by Consolidated Edison (ConEd) at 13,800 volts.

The substations stepped down the 13,800 <b>primary</b> <b>voltage</b> to 480/277 volt secondary service, and then further down to 208/120 volt general power and lighting service.

5000|$|Incompatibility of {{electricity}} parameters: ships, having {{been built in}} diverse international yards, have no uniform voltage and frequency requirement. Some ships use 220 volts at 50 Hz, some at 60 Hz, some others use 110 volts. <b>Primary</b> distribution <b>voltage</b> can vary from 440 volts to 11 kilovolts.|$|R
50|$|The power {{management}} and distribution subsystem operates at a <b>primary</b> bus <b>voltage</b> set to Vmp, the peak power {{point of the}} solar arrays. , Vmp was 160 volts DC (direct current). It can change over time as the arrays degrade from ionizing radiation. Microprocessor-controlled switches control the distribution of primary power throughout the station.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Primary</b> {{distribution}} <b>voltages</b> {{range from}} 4 kV to 35 kV phase-to-phase (2.4 kV to 20 kV phase-to-neutral) Only large consumers are fed directly from distribution voltages; most utility customers {{are connected to}} a transformer, which reduces the distribution voltage to the low voltage [...] "utilization voltage", [...] "supply voltage" [...] or [...] "mains voltage" [...] used by lighting and interior wiring systems.|$|R
5000|$|A padmount or pad-mounted {{transformer}} is {{a ground}} mounted electric power distribution transformer {{in a locked}} steel cabinet mounted on a concrete pad. Since all energized connection points are securely enclosed in a grounded metal housing, a padmount transformer can be installed in places {{that do not have}} room for a fenced enclosure. Padmount transformers are used with underground electric power distribution lines at service drops, to step down the <b>primary</b> <b>voltage</b> on the line to the lower secondary voltage supplied to utility customers. A single transformer may serve one large building, or many homes.|$|E
50|$|When {{the core}} is {{displaced}} toward the top, the voltage {{in the top}} secondary coil increases as the voltage in the bottom decreases. The resulting output voltage increases from zero. This voltage is in phase with the <b>primary</b> <b>voltage.</b> When the core moves in the other direction, the output voltage also increases from zero, but its phase is opposite {{to that of the}} primary. The phase of the output voltage determines the direction of the displacement (up or down) and amplitude indicates the amount of displacement. A synchronous detector can determine a signed output voltage that relates to the displacement.|$|E
50|$|Power {{control for}} the system can be {{achieved}} by a variety of methods. Many latter day units feature thyristor power control which works by means of a full wave AC (alternating current) drive varying the <b>primary</b> <b>voltage</b> to the input transformer. More traditional methods include three phase variacs (autotransformer) or motorised Brentford type voltage regulators to control the input voltage. Another very popular method was to use a two part tank coil with a primary and secondary winding separated by an air gap. Power control was affected by varying the magnetic coupling of the two coils by physically moving them relative to each other.|$|E
30|$|The energy {{consumption}} dataset {{is provided by}} the local energy company, SET, that manages almost the entire electrical network over the Trentino territory. SET uses around 180 <b>primary</b> (medium <b>voltage)</b> distribution lines to bring energy from the national grid (high voltage) to Trentino’s consumers. To ensure the privacy of SET’s customers, their locations and the geometry of the 180 primary distribution lines is not explicitly exposed.|$|R
50|$|As of 2011, the {{electricity}} transmission networks consist of approximately 247 <b>primary</b> high <b>voltage</b> sub-stations. The network is coupled with 10500 low and medium voltage sub-stations (11 kV). Its voltage sub-stations {{are supported by}} a total 4000 km of overhead lines and 8500 km of underground cables running across the country. The National Control Center manages all network demand and data acquisition from generation plants and primary sub-stations.|$|R
50|$|Distribution {{transformers}} {{may include}} an off-load tap changer to allow slight adjustment of the ratio between <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>voltage,</b> {{to bring the}} customer voltage within the desired range on long or heavily loaded lines.|$|R
50|$|The ideal {{transformer}} model assumes that all flux {{generated by the}} primary winding links all the turns of every winding, including itself. In practice, some flux traverses paths that take it outside the windings. Such flux is termed leakage flux, and results in leakage inductance in series with the mutually coupled transformer windings. Leakage flux results in energy being alternately stored in and discharged from the magnetic fields with each cycle of the power supply. It is not directly a power loss, but results in inferior voltage regulation, causing the secondary voltage not to be directly proportional to the <b>primary</b> <b>voltage,</b> particularly under heavy load. Transformers are therefore normally designed to have very low leakage inductance.|$|E
5000|$|The company's core {{semiconductor}} product {{is used for}} energy efficient power supplies. Its patented gate switch technology, called Muxcapacitor, is pre-regulation capacitive voltage reduction technology which uses cascading capacitors to more efficiently store power on a chip. Some capacitor banks are shut down when not in use, conserving power. The device also reduces the <b>primary</b> <b>voltage</b> through a transformer before the energy is processed for voltage and current adjustment and isolation. This reduces {{the size of the}} transformer and limits the need for secondary parts. [...] Also, by using capacitive rather than inductive reductions, the need for magnets is eliminated, and very efficient high voltage conversions are achieved across a range of electrical loads.|$|E
50|$|Although it doesn't {{include a}} capacitor, the {{secondary}} winding {{is also a}} tuned circuit (electrical resonator); the parasitic capacitance between {{the ends of the}} secondary coil resonates with the large inductance of the secondary at a particular resonant frequency. When it is excited at this frequency by the primary, large oscillating voltages are induced in the secondary. The number of turns in the primary winding, and thus the resonant frequency of the primary, could be adjusted with a tap on the coil. When the two tuned circuits are adjusted to resonate at the same frequency, the large turns ratio of the coil, aided by the high Q of the tuned circuits, steps up the <b>primary</b> <b>voltage</b> to hundreds of thousands to millions of volts at the secondary.|$|E

In addition, we realized an adjustable output voltage of the pulser. The <b>primary</b> capacitor <b>voltage</b> can be varied while maintaining proper saturation of the pulse transformer. We will introduce a solution with a pre-magnetizing circuit on the primary winding so that a third winding is not needed...|$|R
50|$|Early color {{correction}} on Rank Cintel MkIII CRT telecine systems {{was accomplished by}} varying the <b>primary</b> gain <b>voltages</b> {{on each of the}} three photomultiplier tubes to vary the output of red, green and blue. Further advancements converted much of the color-processing equipment from analog to digital and then, with the next-generation telecine, the Ursa, the coloring process was completely digital in the 4:2:2 color space. The Ursa Gold brought about color grading in the full 4:4:4 color space.|$|R
50|$|As {{the points}} begin to open, point spacing is {{initially}} {{such that the}} <b>voltage</b> across the <b>primary</b> coil would arc across the points. A capacitor is placed across the points which absorbs the energy stored in the leakage inductance of the primary coil, and slows the rise time of the <b>primary</b> winding <b>voltage</b> to allow the points to open fully. The capacitor's function {{is similar to that}} of a snubber as found in a flyback converter.|$|R
