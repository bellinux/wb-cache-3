This article discusses this idea of 'uplifting the race' and how the portrayal of this appears in films. The article begins with a quote from Eddie Murphy who basically says the white majority has created {{a system in which}} powerful black men feel the need to whisper 'white' in their own office. Olaniyan then discusses a quote from Michael Foucault that describes the situation Murphy talks about in his quote. Olaniyan quotes Paul Rabinow from [...] "Representations Are Social Facts: Modernity and Post modernity in Anthropology" [...] on the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>representation.</b> Olaniyan states that Rabinow is saying [...] "To be in control of (the means of) representation is therefore, {{to be in a position}} of power: that is, to be in control of the production, promotion, and circulation of subjectivities". Olaniyan finds it interesting that in popular opinion, both films failed do that. He discusses how Coming to America 'others' the African people. First, he discusses how the forest and house scenes support this exoticized idea of Africa. He suggests that the film shows Hollywood's idea of Africa's 'civilized' culture. He discusses the role of black women, claiming that they are the [...] "scenery". He then discusses how Coming To America freezes African culture in a [...] "one-dimensional frame" [...] whereas Do the Right Thing gives its audience an unexpected and unapologetic view. Lee displays three-dimensional characters. In the end, Lee fails because he loses sight of the goal of 'uplifting the race'. Olanyian says that they both failed due to their representations of women. He felt that both failed to see the intersectionality of gender and race, therefore not uplifting the race.|$|E

Completeness in {{abstract}} interpretation {{is an ideal}} and rare situation where the abstract semantics is able {{to take full advantage}} of the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>representation</b> of the underlying abstract domain. In this paper, we develop an algebraic theory of completeness in {{abstract interpretation}}.

Under certain hypotheses, a constructive procedure for computing these complete domains is given. These methodologies provide advanced algebraic tools for manipulating abstract interpretations, which can be fruitfully used both in program analysis and in semantics design. ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction In {{the last}} decade, many {{efforts have been}} devoted to an {{analysis}} of the epistemological adequacy, and the computational effectiveness of Description Logics (DLs). In particular, starting with [4], the research on the computational complexity of the reasoning tasks associated with DLs has shown that in order to ensure decidability and/or efficiency of reasoning in all cases, one must renounce to some of the expressive power [17; 19; 20; 12; 13; 11]. These results have led to a debate on the trade-off between expressive <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>representation</b> formalisms and worst-case efficiency of the associated reasoning tasks. This issue {{has been one of the}} main themes in the area of DLs, and has led to at least four different approaches to the design of knowledge representation systems. ffl In the first approach, the main goal of a DL is t...|$|E
