25|$|Nuclear {{medicine}} imaging {{involves the}} administration into the patient of radiopharmaceuticals consisting of substances with affinity for certain body tissues labeled with radioactive tracer. The {{most commonly used}} tracers are technetium-99m, iodine-123, iodine-131, gallium-67, indium-111, thallium-201 and fludeoxyglucose (18F) (18F-FDG). The heart, lungs, thyroid, liver, brain, gallbladder, and bones are commonly evaluated for particular conditions using these techniques. While anatomical detail is limited in these studies, nuclear medicine is useful in displaying physiological function. The excretory function of the kidneys, iodine-concentrating ability of the thyroid, blood flow to heart muscle, etc. can be measured. The principal imaging devices are the gamma camera and the PET Scanner, which detect the radiation emitted by the tracer {{in the body and}} display it as an image. With computer processing, the information can be displayed as axial, coronal and sagittal images (single-photon emission computed tomography - SPECT or <b>Positron-emission</b> <b>tomography</b> - PET). In the most modern devices, nuclear medicine images can be fused with a CT scan taken quasisimultaneously, so the physiological information can be overlaid or coregistered with the anatomical structures to improve diagnostic accuracy.|$|E

50|$|With {{improved}} neuroimaging techniques, it {{has been}} possible to correlate patterns of impairment with a knowledge of exactly which parts {{of the nervous system}} are damaged, allowing previously undiscovered functional relationships to be explored (the lesion method). Contemporary cognitive neuropsychology uses many of the same techniques and technologies from the wider science of neuropsychology and fields such as cognitive neuroscience. These may include neuroimaging, electrophysiology and neuropsychological tests to measure either brain function or psychological performance. Useful technology in cognitive neuropsychology includes <b>positron-emission</b> <b>tomography</b> (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). These techniques make it possible to identify the areas of the brain responsible for performing certain cognitive tasks by measuring blood flow in the brain. PET scans sense the low-level radiation in the brain and produce 3-D images, whereas an fMRI works on a magnetic signal and is used to “map the brain”.

Methods: A total of 142 patients with potentially resectable non-small cell lung cancer were imaged with <b>positron-emission</b> <b>tomography</b> (neck to pelvis). Positron-emission tomographic scans were read prospectively with thoracic computed tomographic comparison. Patients without distant metastases at <b>positron-emission</b> <b>tomography</b> underwent staging with bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy, with or without mediastinotomy or thoracoscopy. Patients with metastases, pleural implants, or N 2 or N 3 disease did not undergo primary resection. Results: <b>Positron-emission</b> <b>tomography</b> revealed unsuspected distant metastases in 24 of 142 patients (16. 9 %) and unsuspected pleural implants in 6 others. Nodal stage was surgically established in 118 cases. <b>Positron-emission</b> <b>tomography</b> showed that 5 patients had nodal disease not accessible by mediastinoscopy. In 35 (24. 6 %) of these 142 cases, <b>positron-emission</b> <b>tomography</b> directed the evaluation away from routine bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy staging that would have resulted in inappropriate treatment selection. <b>Positron-emission</b> <b>tomography</b> correctly differentiated resectable stages IA through IIIA (N 1) from stages IIIA (N 2) through IV in 88. 7 % of cases. In identifying N 2 or N 3 disease, <b>positron-emission</b> <b>tomography</b> had an accuracy of 90. 7 %, a sensitivity of 80. 9 %, a specificity of 96 %, and positive and negative predictive values of 91. 9 % and 90. 1 %, respectively. Of the 8 cases in which <b>positron-emission</b> <b>tomography</b> missed N 2 disease, 7 had the disease discovered by mediastinoscopy and 1 had it discovered at thoracotomy. Conclusions: The diagnostic accuracy of positron-emission tomography-enhanced clinical staging is high. <b>Positron-emission</b> <b>tomography</b> has previously been used primarily to screen for lymph node spread and distant metastases, but it also provides localizing information that allows directed and more sensitive surgical staging and refinement of patient selection for curative resection. <b>Positron-emission</b> <b>tomography</b> and surgical staging play complementary roles in the journey toward more accurate overall staging.
