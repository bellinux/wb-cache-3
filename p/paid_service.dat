40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{effectiveness}} of <b>paid</b> <b>services</b> in supporting unpaid carers’ employment in England. There is currently a new emphasis in England on ‘replacement care’, or <b>paid</b> <b>services</b> for the cared-for person, {{as a means of}} supporting working carers. The international evidence on {{the effectiveness of}} <b>paid</b> <b>services</b> as a means of supporting carers’ employment is inconclusive and does not relate specifically to England. The study reported here explores this issue using the 2009 / 10 Personal Social Services Survey of Adult Carers in England. The study finds a positive association between carers’ employment and receipt of <b>paid</b> <b>services</b> by the cared-for person, controlling for covariates. It therefore gives support to the hypothesis that services for the cared-for person are effective in supporting carers’ employment. Use of home care and a personal assistant are associated on their own with the employment of both men and women carers, while use of day care and meals-on-wheels are associated specifically with women’s employment. Use of short-term breaks are associated with carers’ employment when combined with other services. The paper supports the emphasis in English social policy on <b>paid</b> <b>services</b> as a means of supporting working carers, but questions {{the use of the term}} ‘replacement care’ and the emphasis on ‘the market’...|$|R
25|$|Before 1938, {{there were}} some 1,600 local fire brigades in operation. The Fire Brigades Act 1938 {{constituted}} the councils of all county boroughs and county districts (municipal boroughs, urban and rural districts) as fire authorities. The councils were required to provide the services for their borough or district of such a fire brigade and of such fire engines, appliances and equipment as {{may be necessary to}} meet efficiently all normal requirements. At roughly the same time, the Auxiliary Fire Service, consisting largely of unpaid volunteers, was formed in parallel to the Air Raid Precautions organisation. Every borough and urban district had an AFS unit, and they operated their own fire stations in parallel to the local authority. Members of the AFS could be called up for full-time <b>paid</b> <b>service</b> if necessary, a similar arrangement applied to the wartime Special Constabulary.|$|E
