50|$|For {{meat and}} <b>poultry</b> <b>products,</b> which are {{regulated}} by USDA, {{the rules are}} more complicated. Ready-to-eat meat and <b>poultry</b> <b>products</b> contaminated with pathogens, such as Salmonella or Listeria monocytogenes, are adulterated. (Note that hotdogs are considered ready-to-eat products.) For raw meat or <b>poultry</b> <b>products,</b> the presence of pathogens will not always render a product adulterated (because raw meat and <b>poultry</b> <b>products</b> are intended to be cooked, and proper cooking should kill pathogens). Raw poultry contaminated with Salmonella is not adulterated. However, USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has ruled that raw meat or <b>poultry</b> <b>products</b> contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 are adulterated. This is because normal cooking methods may not reduce E. coli O157:H7 below infectious levels. E. coli O157:H7 is the only pathogen that is considered an adulterant when present in raw meat or <b>poultry</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R

These include seizing and condemning the product, detaining imported product, enjoining persons from manufacturing or distributing the product, or requesting a recall of the product.

In the case of an adulterated meat or <b>poultry</b> <b>product,</b> FSIS has certain additional powers. FSIS may suspend or withdraw federal inspection of an official establishment. Without federal inspection, an establishment may not produce or process meat or poultry products, and therefore must cease operations.
