This paper investigates {{the performance of the}} SDS (X) over bar chart with estimated <b>process</b> <b>parameters,</b> in terms of the average run length (ARL), average number of observations to signal (ANOS) and standard deviation of the run length (SDRL). The performance of the SDS (X) over bar chart with estimated <b>process</b> <b>parameters</b> by minimizing the out-of-control ARL and the out-of-control ANOS is compared with the corresponding chart's performance with known <b>process</b> <b>parameters.</b> In addition, the minimum number of Phase I samples required by the SDS (X) over bar chart with estimated <b>process</b> <b>parameters</b> so that it has approximately the same in-control ARL and ANOS performances as the chart with known <b>process</b> <b>parameters</b> is studied. The ARL, ANOS and SDRL properties of the SDS (X) over bar chart with estimated <b>process</b> <b>parameters</b> differ significantly from that of the chart with known <b>process</b> <b>parameters.</b> Therefore, suitable optimal charting parameters are introduced so that the SDS (X) over bar chart with estimated <b>process</b> <b>parameters</b> has an adequate performance as its known <b>process</b> <b>parameters</b> counterpart without having to use large number of Phase I samples and sample size...|$|R

The “free acid” (sulfuric acid) content of these leach solutions is a critical <b>process</b> <b>parameter.</b> While thermometric titrimetry can determine the free acid content with modest amounts of Fe(III), in some solutions the Fe(III) content is so high as to cause serious interference. Complexation with necessarily large amounts of oxalate is undesirable due to the toxicity of the reagent. A thermometric titration was devised by diluting the aliquot with propan-2-ol and titration with standard KOH in propan-2-ol. Most of the metal content precipitated prior to the commencement of the titration, and a clear, sharp endpoint for the sulfuric acid content was obtained.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – We {{present a}} novel low cost scheme for the on-die {{measurement}} of either clock jitter, or <b>process</b> <b>parameter</b> variations. By re-using and properly modifying the Ring Oscillators (ROs) {{that are currently}} widely employed for <b>process</b> <b>parameter</b> variation measurement in high performance microprocessors, our proposed scheme can be easily set in either the <b>process</b> <b>parameter</b> variation measurement mode, or the clock jitter measurement mode, by acting on an external control signal. This way, during the test or debug phase, clock jitter can also be measured at negligible area and power costs with respect to <b>process</b> <b>parameter</b> variation measurement only. Our scheme is scalable in the provided clock jitter measurement resolution, while allowing the same <b>process</b> <b>parameter</b> variation measurement resolution as the currently employed RO based schemes. Moreover, due to its allowing both <b>process</b> <b>parameter</b> variation and clock jitter measurements, our scheme features accurate clock jitter measurement despite the possible presence of significant <b>process</b> <b>parameter</b> variations...|$|E

A large set of 21 <b>process</b> <b>parameters</b> that could affect the device behavior have been investigated through Plackett–Burman screening design of experiment for 100 nm CMOS disposable spacer process technique. First-order regression models obtained from the experimental data in terms of these 21 <b>process</b> <b>parameters,</b> for threshold voltage $V_{tsat}$, subthreshold slope $SS_{sat}$, on-state current $I_{dsatdrive}$, and leakage current $I_{dsatleak}$ in the saturation region, are {{used to determine the}} statistical significance of each <b>process</b> <b>parameters</b> in terms of their rank. The ranking order, indicating the statistical significance of the respective <b>process</b> <b>parameters,</b> differs between NMOS and PMOS devices.

For example, in turning, multiple combinations of process parameters may lead to the same or similar value of surface roughness. In EMM, multiple combinations of process parameters may lead to the same or similar value of taper and overcut.
