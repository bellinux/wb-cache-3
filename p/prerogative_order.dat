5|$|Before May 2011, {{it was not}} {{possible}} to apply for prerogative orders and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings. In Chan Hiang Leng Colin, the appellants contended that a declaration might be obtained in proceedings taken under Order 53 of the Rules of Court. The Court of Appeal, following Re Application by Dow Jones (Asia) Inc. (1987), held that it had no power to grant a declaration under Order 53 because a declaration is not a form of <b>prerogative</b> <b>order.</b> If a declaration was sought, it had to be applied for by way of writ if there were substantial factual disputes between the parties, or, if not, by originating summons. In Yip Kok Seng v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board (2010), the High Court expressed the view that due to the lack of a unified regime in Singapore for applying for prerogative orders and declarations, it was not an abuse of process for an applicant to seek redress for a public law right by way of a declaration instead of applying for a <b>prerogative</b> <b>order.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once leave is granted, an {{applicant}} {{moves on to}} the second stage and applies for a <b>prerogative</b> <b>order</b> by filing in the High Court a document called a summons within the legal proceedings already started earlier. This must be done between eight and 14 days after leave {{to do so is}} granted by the Court; beyond that, the leave lapses. The applicant must serve the ex parte originating summons, the statement, the supporting affidavit, the order granting leave, and the summons by which the <b>prerogative</b> <b>order</b> is actually applied for, on all persons directly affected. Where the application relates to court proceedings and is intended to compel the court or a court official to do an act relating to the proceedings, or to quash the proceedings or any order made in them, the documents must be served on the registrar of the court and the other parties to the proceedings. The documents must also be served on the judge if his or her conduct is being objected to. If the Court is of opinion that any person who ought to have been served with the documents has not been served, the Court may adjourn the hearing on such terms as it may direct in order that the documents may be served on that person.|$|E
5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court commanding a public authority to perform a public duty, while a prohibiting order operates to prevent illegal action by an authority from occurring in the first place. A quashing order, the most commonly sought <b>prerogative</b> <b>order,</b> {{has the effect of}} invalidating an ultra vires decision made by an authority. Obtaining a mandatory, prohibiting or quashing order is a two-stage process, as an applicant must be granted leave by the Court to apply for the order. The Court must find the existence of a proper public law issue and available grounds of review. Leave will be granted provided that an arguable and prima facie case of reasonable suspicion that the authority has acted in breach of administrative law rules is established.|$|E
5|$|With {{effect from}} 1 May 2011, it became {{possible}} {{to include an}} {{application for a declaration}} together with an application for one or more <b>prerogative</b> <b>orders.</b> However, the application for a declaration cannot be made unless the court grants leave for the <b>prerogative</b> <b>orders</b> to be applied for.|$|R
5|$|The Subordinate Courts are not {{empowered}} to grant <b>prerogative</b> <b>orders.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{declaration}} is a pronouncement {{by a court}} {{stating the}} legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. Before 1 May 2011, {{it was not possible}} to apply for <b>prerogative</b> <b>orders</b> and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings. Following that date, changes to Order 53 of the Rules of Court permitted an application for a declaration to be made together with an application for one or more <b>prerogative</b> <b>orders.</b> However, the application for a declaration cannot be made unless the court grants leave for the <b>prerogative</b> <b>orders</b> to be applied for.|$|R
5|$|If a {{mandatory}} order, prohibiting order or quashing order is sought, the applicant must follow the procedure {{set out in}} Order 53 of the Rules of Court. In general, there are two stages. At the first stage, an applicant must obtain leave {{to apply for the}} <b>prerogative</b> <b>order.</b> This requirement prevents unmeritorious applications from being taken against decision-makers by filtering out groundless cases at an early stage to prevent wastage of judicial time, and protects public bodies from harassment, intentional or otherwise. An application for such leave must be made by ex parte originating summons and must be supported by a statement setting out the name and description of the applicant, the relief sought and the grounds on which it is sought; and by an affidavit, to be filed when the application is made, verifying the facts relied on. In granting leave, the judge hearing the application for leave may impose such terms as to costs and as to security as he or she thinks fit.|$|E
25|$|To {{direct a}} public body fulfil a {{legitimate}} expectation, the court issues a mandatory order (also {{known as a}} mandamus). This is a <b>prerogative</b> <b>order</b> which commands a public body to perform a public duty, and {{is often used to}} compel public bodies to exercise the powers given to them.|$|E
25|$|Before O. 53 was amended in 2011, the High Court did {{not have}} {{jurisdiction}} to grant a declaration under O.53 proceedings, as a declaration is not a <b>prerogative</b> <b>order.</b> If an applicant wished to obtain both prerogative orders and declarations, a separate action had to be commenced for the declarations. After the amendment, {{it is now possible}} to include a claim for a declaration if leave has been granted to the applicant to apply for prerogative orders.|$|E
25|$|However, as <b>prerogative</b> <b>orders</b> are {{discretionary}} remedies, the Court retains {{discretion to}} refuse leave if the circumstances warrant it.|$|R
25|$|Should leave be granted, the {{applicant}} can {{proceed to the}} second stage which is the actual application for {{one or more of}} the <b>prerogative</b> <b>orders.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{procedure}} for bringing applications for <b>prerogative</b> <b>orders</b> is {{set out in}} Order53 of the Rules of Court ("O. 53"). It is a two-stage process. At the first stage, the applicant must request the High Court for leave to apply for one or more <b>prerogative</b> <b>orders.</b> An application for such leave must be made by ex parte originating summons and must be supported by a statement setting out the name and description of the applicant, the relief sought and the grounds on which it is sought; and by an affidavit verifying the facts relied on.|$|R
500|$|In Singapore, an {{applicant}} {{must have a}} [...] "sufficient interest" [...] in {{the subject of the}} application to have standing to apply for a <b>prerogative</b> <b>order,</b> that is, a mandatory, prohibiting or quashing order. Previously, the rule of standing for mandatory orders was stricter than the rule applicable to prohibiting and quashing orders. To apply for a mandatory order, {{an applicant}} had to show a specific legal right in the matter. In contrast, an applicant only had to show that [...] "there had been an abuse of power which inconvenienced someone" [...] to apply for a prohibiting or quashing order. This rule of standing for prohibiting and quashing orders was relatively easy to satisfy because such orders were often used to ensure good standards of public administration.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{a person}} can apply to the High Court for a <b>prerogative</b> <b>order</b> such as a {{mandatory}} order, {{he or she must}} be granted leave to do so by the Court. The requirement for leave is a preliminary step that helps to sieve out [...] "groundless or hopeless cases at an early stage" [...] and [...] "prevent a wasteful use of judicial time and to protect public bodies from harassment". Leave will be granted if the Court is satisfied of the following: ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{controversial}} GCHQ case {{determined the}} scope of judicial review of prerogative powers (the Crown's residual powers under common law). This was Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service [...] AC 374 (often known simply as the [...] "GCHQ case"). In this case, a <b>prerogative</b> <b>Order</b> in Council had {{been used by the}} prime minister (who is the Minister for the Civil Service) to ban trade union activities by civil servants working at GCHQ. This order was issued without consultation. The House of Lords had to decide whether this was reviewable by judicial review. It was held that executive action is not immune from judicial review simply because it uses powers derived from common law rather than statute (thus the prerogative is reviewable). Controversially, they also held that although the failure to consult was unfair, this was overridden by concerns of national security.|$|E

5|$|The ancient {{remedies}} of certiorari, mandamus, prohibition and {{habeas corpus}} were originally only {{available to the}} British Crown and thus termed prerogative writs, that is, writs that could be issued at the prerogative of the sovereign. By {{the end of the}} 16th century, they could theoretically be sought by any aggrieved citizen. In 1938, the writs were abolished in the United Kingdom and replaced by <b>prerogative</b> <b>orders</b> with essentially the same names and functions. As a former British colony, Singapore inherited English administrative law at independence and the Singapore courts continue to pay close attention to English cases. In Singapore, the <b>prerogative</b> <b>orders</b> were known by their traditional names until 2006, when the names were modernized.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>prerogative</b> <b>orders,</b> the equitable remedy of a declaration {{can be employed}} to control an excess of legal authority. A declaration is a pronouncement by a court stating the legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. In contrast to the <b>prerogative</b> <b>orders</b> which are termed public law remedies, the declaration is called a private law remedy as it was originally developed in court cases between private parties. Only the High Court may grant declarations in judicial review cases; although the Subordinate Courts are generally empowered by the Subordinate Courts Act to grant declarations, a District Court exercises no judicial review jurisdiction over acts or decisions of persons or authorities, and a Magistrate's Court cannot deal with any action {{in which there is}} no claim for any sum of money.|$|R

5|$|In Tan Eng Hong, the Court of Appeal {{stated that}} the same test for {{standing}} applies to both declarations and <b>prerogative</b> <b>orders,</b> and read the statements from Chan Hiang Leng Colin quoted above as an implicit acceptance that an applicant must demonstrate the violation of a right personal {{to him or her}} to have standing.|$|R
50|$|Matters {{which still}} {{fall within the}} Royal Prerogative, and hence are {{regulated}} by (<b>Prerogative)</b> <b>Orders</b> in Council, include dealing with servants of the Crown, such as the standing orders for civil servants, appointing heads of Crown corporations, governance of British Overseas Territories, making appointments in the Church of England and dealing with international relations.|$|R
25|$|In Singapore, the High Court has {{the power}} to issue <b>prerogative</b> <b>orders.</b> These include {{mandatory}} orders which have the effect of directing public authorities to take certain actions, prohibiting orders that forbid them from acting, and quashing orders that invalidate their acts or decisions.

Questions of law concerning the Constitution can be referred by a Subordinate Court to the High Court for its decision at any stage of proceedings. In Chee Soon Juan v. Public Prosecutor (2011), which concerned a criminal matter, the High Court held that since the Subordinate Courts lack the power to grant <b>prerogative</b> <b>orders,</b> they do not have jurisdiction to deal with the substantive issues of a constitutional challenge. Such questions should be referred to the High Court unless they are [...] "frivolous, or ... made for collateral purposes or to delay proceedings, or if they otherwise constitute an abuse of process". The Court also cautioned against section395 being used to circumvent the requirement that leave of court must be obtained to apply for <b>prerogative</b> <b>orders</b> (see below).|$|R
25|$|An {{applicant}} who {{alleges that}} a public authority's act or decision has infringed {{his or her}} constitutional rights may bring a judicial review case to the High Court challenging it.
