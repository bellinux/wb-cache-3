40|$|With the {{increasing}} consumer digital content, demand for high capacity digital storage is increasing rapidly. Today, <b>portable</b> <b>storage</b> <b>media’s</b> {{are widely used}} in all mobile phones, digital Cameras, camcorders, and in many multimedia devices. Different memory formats like Flash, Secure Digital (SD), Compact Flash, Universal Serial Bus(USB), and Multimedia Card (MMC) {{are available in the}} market to store the digital contents. Of all these formats, SD provides many advantages over other formats. SD cards provide high storage capacity, higher transfer speed, and interoperability with Personal Computer (PC) related devices and multimedia products. Portable devices are battery operated, so they need to be power efficient. The goal of the Project is to design Secure Digital card which consumes low power and transfers data with greater speed...|$|R

50|$|Type-ins {{were very}} common in the early home {{computer}} era of the late 1970s and early 1980s because of the period's lack of inexpensive <b>portable</b> <b>storage</b> <b>media,</b> the low penetration of modems and bulletin board systems, and the relatively short maximum length for a program's code on a home computer with a main memory of a few tens of kilobytes. Type-ins were often seen as useful for learning programming, allowing users to begin their programming efforts by porting a program written for one system for use on another.|$|E

As well as bringing artists to remote communities to conduct those workshops, Big hART also partnered with the record label ‘Tracks of the Desert’ to record and publish project material, i.e. the “Ngurakutu Ara” CD in Ernabella (SA) with proceeds going towards purchasing musical equipment for the community.

Simply deleting the data in question or formatting the storage device is not enough to ensure that the data cannot be recovered. Furthermore, with the uptake of Universal Serial Bus drives (USBs) flash memory based storage devices have replaced previous <b>portable</b> secondary <b>storage</b> <b>media.</b> Therefore, it is of a major concern whether these tools and products developed for securely erasing data secondary storage Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) would be as efficient when targeting the USB flash memory storage devices. With a wide range of open source and commercial products available on the market, all claiming, among other things, to be able to securely delete your data, it is quite a difficult task for the consumer to pick the most efficient product.

50|$|WiRED International’s mission became {{focused on}} medical and health {{education}} {{as a result of the}} clear needs evident in Kosovo. A year later, with a National Institutes of Health developmental grant, WiRED began HIV/AIDS education programs across Kenya and then in Sierra Leone. The work expanded to all medical and health concerns, and today through partnerships, WiRED programs are in several African countries and in parts of China, Central and South America, the Middle East, Melanesia and Eurasia. In spring 2003 the State Department asked Dr. Selnow to travel to Baghdad with a representative of its U.S. Global Technology Corps to explore how WiRED could most effectively deliver medical training programs to Iraqi doctors. In June 2003, after reviewing field conditions and talking with U.S officials, Iraqi physicians and medical educators, WiRED launched the first technology-based medical training program in the country, starting with the opening of a facility in Iraq’s Medical City Center. Within 18 months the organization had set up 39 centers around Iraq. Several years later WiRED launched the country’s first telemedicine program. Technical problems with satellite availability in the war zone made that program difficult, and it never fully matured. WiRED’s work in Iraq ended in 2010, as the U.S. commitment was winding down. In 2011, as WiRED’s ground programs expanded elsewhere, it began development of its own educational training materials. The program evolved, in 2013, into the Center for the Development and Distribution of Health Education Programs. This resource supplies {{medical and health education}} modules via the Internet and <b>portable</b> <b>storage</b> <b>media.</b> It allows partners or any interested NGO to store training modules on thumb drives and laptops and sync them to acquire updates. The result has been a broad distribution of health education programs, even in the most remote areas. Now in 2014, WiRED has evolved into a health education hub operating in remote and resource-starved regions globally. WiRED collects intellectual content from physicians, nurses and medical educators from around the world. WiRED packages and translates it, when appropriate, and distributes it widely. This clearinghouse model has enabled many medical professionals to contribute to the program, and it has provided a source of health content for people in places isolated and often ignored.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{computers}} are {{an essential part}} of modern pharmaceutical research and data storage. It is also well known that experimental and observational data is crucial for scientific research. For approximately twelve years now, the pharmaceutical industry is storing its research data on <b>portable</b> <b>storage</b> <b>media,</b> where each research group was obligated to archive their research data on such portable media but they had also much individual responsibility for the archiving process. So far there are over 3. 000 portable media in the raw data archives of Novartis. Digital data archives are more unstable than paper-based archives basically due to development of computer technology and rapid changes of digital storage media. To guarantee the future readability and to preserve the research data, Novartis has decided to migrate the data from the current <b>portable</b> <b>storage</b> <b>media</b> to a storage type more suitable for long-term preservation while preserving the authenticity and provenance. In this paper, we would like to report on this migration project that nicely illustrates several problems of digital archiving and provides state-ofthe-art solutions for them...|$|E

40|$|USB storage devices, {{also known}} as USB sticks, pen drives, flash drives, thumb drives, and key drives, have {{replaced}} many other <b>portable</b> <b>storage</b> <b>media.</b> USB devices are popular given their robustness, low power consumption, rapid response rates, non-volatile nature, capacity, and ease of transportation. However, the data on these devices are most often unsecured and not deleted when disposed of. Using a quantitative and case study method to assess the extent and potential impact of the problem, this study obtained second-hand USB devices, purchased from eBay Australia to determine the data and erasure status of the devices using forensic acquisition and analysis techniques. Where data fragments were recovered, the volume and potential sensitivity of were investigated. The findings from the research show that in most cases, the USB devices held a large volume of data, were owned by both individuals and organizations, and were used to store highly sensitive and confidential data. This data were neither permanently nor securely destroyed prior to disposal (by sale) of the devices. Such incidents highlight the failure to meet regulatory obligations regarding privacy legislation in Australia. The paper provides recommendations for secure disposal of data from USB devices...|$|E
