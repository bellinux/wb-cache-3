As the above analysis, in the respect of energy type, coal-fired electricity would be the mainly power supply source under 0 % <b>pollutants</b> emission <b>reduction.</b> Natural gas-fired electricity conversion technology would {{play a key role}} in the power generation activities, coal-fired power would be in a second place and wind power would be the supplement under 10 % and 20 % <b>pollutants</b> emissions <b>reduction.</b> This is because coal-fired electricity conversion technology has comparatively low operating and penalty costs and relatively low capital cost for capacity expansion, and the related cost of natural gas-fired electricity conversion technology is a little higher than coal-fired power and the pollutants emission from natural gas-fired power generation process is smaller relatively. The maximum optimized wind power generation would be 0.5 GWh in April, July and October, due to the relatively higher operating cost and capital cost for its storage, which limits the development of wind power. The dominant role of coal-fired electricity would be displaced by some other conversion technologies with an increased demand for <b>pollutants</b> emission <b>reduction.</b> For example, under 20 % <b>pollutants</b> emission <b>reduction,</b> the optimized coal-fired power target would decrease to [39.94, 46.20] GWh in January; although fuel-fired power would decrease, the optimized targets of wind power would have a growth and play an important role to meet electricity demand. It indicates that environment-friendly electricity conversion technologies should better serve interests of the <b>pollutants</b> emission <b>reduction</b> and be chosen for power generation to meet the ever-increasing electricity demands and gradually enhancing <b>pollutants</b> emission <b>reduction</b> requirements.

Reflecting simultaneous re-moval of air pollutants along with the GHGs emission reduction, this study investigated relative cost effec-tiveness among GHGs reduction action plans in Busan Metropolitan City. We employed the Data Envelop-ment Analysis (DEA), a methodology that evaluates relative efficiency of decision-making units (DMUs) producing multiple outputs with multiple inputs, for the investigation. Assigning each GHGs reduction action plan to a DMU, implementation cost of each GHGs reduction action plan to an input, and reduction potential of GHGs and air pollutants by each GHGs reduction action plan to an output, we calculated effi-ciency scores for each GHGs reduction action plan.
