50|$|A <b>potato</b> <b>spinner</b> is {{connected}} to a tractor through the three-point linkage. Older machines were drawn by horse and were driven by a ground drive. It works by a flat piece of metal which runs horizontal to the ground lifting the potatoes up and a large wheel with spokes on it called a reel pushing the clay and potatoes out to the side. The potatoes are then gathered by hand, placed into containers and transported from the field for further packaging.|$|E

On October 12, 1886, while still superintendent, he had applied for a patent for a <b>potato</b> <b>spinner</b> he invented, and the United States Patent Office had granted the patent on July 5, 1887. After his return to Orchard Park, he filed for a patent for an improvement of the device on November 18, 1889, and was granted a patent on the improved version on September 30, 1890.|$|E
