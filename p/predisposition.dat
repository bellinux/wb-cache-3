When campaign related information flows activate <b>predispositions,</b> election results are largely predetermined given balanced resources.

5000|$|Calculus of <b>predispositions,</b> a {{basic part}} of <b>predispositioning</b> theory, {{belongs to the}} indeterministic procedures. “The key {{component}} of any indeterministic procedure is the evaluation of a position. Since {{it is impossible to}} devise a deterministic chain linking the inter-mediate state with the outcome of the game, the most complex component of any indeterministic method is assessing these intermediate stages. It is precisely the function of <b>predispositions</b> {{to assess the impact of}} an intermediate state upon the future course of development.” [...] According to Katsenelinboigen, calculus of <b>predispositions</b> is another method of computing probability. Both methods may lead to the same results and, thus, can be interchangeable. However, it is not always possible to interchange them since computing via frequencies requires availability of statistics, possibility to gather the data as well as having the knowledge of the extent to which one can interlink the system’s constituent elements. Also, no statistics can be obtained on unique events and, naturally, in such cases the calculus of <b>predispositions</b> becomes the only option.The procedure of calculating <b>predispositions</b> is linked to two steps - dissection of the system on its constituent elements and integration of the analyzed parts in a new whole. According to Katsenelinboigen, the system is structured by two basic types of parameters - material and positional. The material parameters constitute the skeleton of the system. Relationships between them form positional parameters. The calculus of <b>predispositions</b> primarily deals with ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the nexus}} of public attitudes toward military missions abroad, specific beliefs about the respective missions, and political <b>predispositions.</b> While some studies have argued that specific beliefs such as success expectations {{are the most important}} explanatory factors of attitudes, others have stressed the role of party-related <b>predispositions</b> in shaping both beliefs and attitudes. Using the case of German citizens’ attitudes toward the German participation in the International Security Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan, we argue that scope conditions determine the relative merit of these perspectives. With data from a representative survey conducted in 2010 we show that in this late stage of the military mission, success expectations had a substantial effect on German citizens’ mission support that was not merely mediating the influence of <b>predispositions.</b> At the same time, foreign policy <b>predispositions</b> also had a substantial impact on mission support, while party identifications had only minor effects.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a {{model in}} which individuals care about both consumption (intrinsic utility) and social status. Status depends on public perceptions about an individual's <b>predispositions</b> {{rather than on the}} individual's actions. However, since <b>predispositions</b> are unobservable, actions signal <b>predispositions</b> and therefore affect status. When status is sufficiently important relative to intrinsic utility, many individuals conform to a rigid standard of behavior, despite heterogeneous intrinsic preferences. When status is relatively unimportant, no conformity emerges. The model produces both customs and fads, and it suggests an explanation for the development of multiple subcultures with distinct norms.

40|$|Title: About {{identification}} of motor <b>predispositions</b> in triathlon Aims: The aim {{of our study}} was to find and verify appropriate indicators predicting the on-coming performance in a short triathlon and determine their level for the junior category. Methods: In our study, we combined quantitative and qualitative approaches with a predominance of quantitative methods. In {{the first phase of}} the research, we used quantitative methods, confirmatory factor analysis for verification of models of <b>predispositions</b> and elaboration of performance standards for individual tests by means of T-points. In the second part of the research, we used the qualitative method (casuistic studies) to validate the test battery and its application in practice. Results: We have compiled a structural model of motor <b>predispositions</b> for short triathlon, which explained 91 % of all cross-correlations of seventeen used indicators. <b>Predispositions</b> for triathlon were categorized into five separate groups; for swimming, cycling and running (i. e. according to individual disciplines), and functional and psychological <b>predispositions.</b> Finding a lower limit boundary of performance in the completed tests is considered to be the most important issue for the assessment of future performance in triathlon.

5|$|During his {{successful}} {{campaign for the}} U.S. presidency, Dwight Eisenhower pledged to pursue a more proactive anti-communist policy, promising to roll back communism, rather than contain it.

The length of the nerve is a factor since it {{is more common in}} larger horses, and the left side is affected almost exclusively. As the nerve cells die, there is a progressive paralysis of the larynx, causing the airway to collapse.

The condition is incurable, but surgery can keep the airway open. Experiments with nerve grafts have been tried.|$|E
