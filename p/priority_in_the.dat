5|$|At {{the start}} of the battle, they were poorly armed and many were {{equipped}} only with hunting rifles. They relied mostly on light infantry weapons, but obtained a few artillery pieces and anti-aircraft guns and improvised their own land mines. They also obtained several hundred anti-tank weapons such as M79 and M80 rocket launchers, but were critically short of ammunition throughout the battle. The capture of JNA barracks somewhat improved the situation as Vukovar had the <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supply of arms. It is estimated that the Vukovar battlefield consumed around 55–60 percent of all ammunition available to the Croatian forces.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its limited}} release, English-language copies of Panzer Dragoon Saga are rare and sell for high prices. It {{has not been}} re-released. In 2009, a {{spokesperson}} for the game-downloading service GameTap stated that GameTap had non-exclusive rights to distribute the game, but as Saturn emulation is difficult, there was not enough demand to make it a <b>priority.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> same year, Futatsugi stated that Sega had lost the game's source code, which would make porting the game difficult.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, the Cotswold Canals Partnership was established, drawing {{together}} people {{representing the}} Proprietors, the Cotswold Canals Trust, councils at district and county level, {{and a number}} of other interested parties. This provided a suitable structure to drive the restoration forwards. In 2002, the waterway was identified as being of high <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Association of Inland Navigation Authorities report entitled Vision for Strategic Enhancement of Britain's Inland Navigation Network, and was one of several new projects highlighted at British Waterways' Unlocked and Unlimited conference held in March. The estimated cost of the project to restore both the Stroudwater Navigation and the Thames and Severn Canal was £82 million.|$|E
5|$|The Republic of Senegal {{placed an}} {{emphasis}} on tourism early in its history. The results were promising, and developing the industry further became a <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country's 4th Economic and Social Plan (19731977). Casamance subsequently became the main tourist destination in the country. Already having been described in the 19th century by Captain Brosselard-Faidherbe {{as a kind of}} Brazil in Africa, Carabane seemed well-placed to attract visitors in search of exoticism as well as vacationers seeking sandy beaches and kite surfing.|$|E

5|$|Bradman {{arranged}} for Lindwall {{to see his}} Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, who restored the paceman’s leg to prime condition in a fortnight. On the public relations front, Bradman stated his firm belief in the fairness of Lindwall's delivery. During the lengthy sea voyage to England, Bradman {{emphasized the importance of}} caution with respect to his bowling action. Bradman advised Lindwall to ensure that his dragging rear right foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled, and to refrain from bowling at full speed until the umpires were satisfied with his delivery stride. The Australian captain guaranteed Lindwall selection for the Tests and told him that his first <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lead-in tour matches was passing the umpires' scrutiny. Bradman recalled how paceman Ernie McCormick had been no-balled 35 times in the traditional tour opener against Worcester during the 1938 campaign, destroying his confidence {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|In November1906 the American Robert Peary {{returned}} from his latest unsuccessful quest for the North Pole, claiming a new Farthest North of 87°6′—a record disputed by later historians. He immediately began raising funds for a further attempt. In July1907 Dr Frederick Cook, a former shipmate of Amundsen's from Belgica, set off northwards on what was ostensibly a hunting trip but was rumoured to be an attempt on the North Pole. A month later Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition sailed for Antarctica, while Robert Falcon Scott was preparing a further expedition should Shackleton fail. Amundsen {{saw no reason to}} concede <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south to the British, and spoke publicly about the prospects of leading an Antarctic expedition—although his preferred goal remained the North Pole.|$|E
5|$|Much {{of what is}} now MD291 was {{constructed}} as two different highways. MD291 proper ran from MD290 near Chesterville through Millington to the Delaware state line. MD447 connected US213 in Chestertown and MD290 in Chesterville, using MD291's current corridor from Chestertown to Morgnec and a more northerly path from Morgnec to Chesterville. MD291 {{was constructed}} as a concrete road from Millington to the Delaware state line in 1929 and 1930; the portion of River Road on which MD290 runs concurrently with MD291 was paved in concrete in the same time span. The concrete highway was extended west from Millington to Mills Branch in two sections, the eastern part completed in 1933 and the western segment built in 1934 and 1935. Kent County included the portion of River Road between MD290 and Mills Branch as its top <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> post-war construction program; that segment was surfaced and brought into the state highway system as an extension of MD291 in 1946.|$|E

5|$|The {{support of}} missionary work {{was also a}} <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th century. The first General Assembly {{requested}} {{that each of the}} four synods appoint and support two missionaries. Presbyterians took leading roles in creating early local and independent mission societies, including the New York Missionary Society (1796), the Northern Berkshire and Columbia Missionary Societies (1797), the Missionary Society of Connecticut (1798), the Massachusetts Missionary Society (1799), and the Boston Female Society for Missionary Purposes (1800). The first denominational missions agency was the Standing Committee on Mission, which was created in 1802 to coordinate efforts with individual presbyteries and the European missionary societies. The work of the committee was expanded in 1816, becoming the Board of Missions.|$|E
5|$|The {{system has}} {{two types of}} receivers: radio terminals, which can either be {{hand-held}} or mounted in vehicles, and desktop equipment for control centers. The system will include 40,000 radios throughout the country. Compared to the analog network, the digital radio equipment will be smaller and have options for additional equipment such as hands free, and allow special radios for motorcycles, snowmobiles, boats, undercover activities and smoke diving. Communication can either be performed as one-to-one conversations, group calls for predefined or ad-hoc groups, with radios able {{to be part of}} several groups, or as walkie talkies in areas without network coverage. The digital transmission reduced background noise and allows monitoring terminal identity to prohibit unauthorized use. All radios are equipped with an emergency button that will give <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> network.|$|E
5|$|Vanguard {{was laid}} down on 2 October 1941 by John Brown and Company of Clydebank, Scotland, with the yard number of 567. After the Japanese {{invasion}} of Malaya in December, {{the ship was}} given an A1 <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope of finishing her {{by the end of}} 1944 and construction of the light cruiser HMS Bellerophon, as well as some merchant shipping, was halted to expedite the ship's completion. This was unsuccessful, however, due to a shortage of skilled labour. As a result, it was not until 30 November 1944 that the ship was launched. Princess Elizabeth presided over this ceremony, the first ship she ever launched, and was presented with a diamond rose brooch to commemorate the event.|$|E

5|$|The gray wolf's {{range in}} the Soviet Union {{encompassed}} nearly the entire territory of the country, being absent only on the Solovetsky Islands, Franz-Josef Land, Severnaya Zemlya, and the Karagin, Commander and Shantar Islands. The species was exterminated twice in Crimea, once after the Russian Civil War, and again after World War II. Following the two world wars, Soviet wolf populations peaked twice. 30,000 wolves were harvested annually out of a population of 200,000 during the 1940s, with 40,000–50,000 harvested during peak years. Soviet wolf populations reached a low around 1970, disappearing over much of European Russia. The population increased again by 1980 to about 75,000, with 32,000 being killed in 1979. Wolf populations in northern inner Mongolia declined during the 1940s, primarily because of poaching of gazelles, the wolf's main prey. In British-ruled India, wolves were heavily persecuted because of their attacks on sheep, goats and children. In 1876, 2,825 wolves were bountied in the North-Western Provinces (NWP) and Bihar. By the 1920s, wolf extermination remained a <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NWP and Awadh. Overall, over 100,000 wolves were killed for bounties in British India between 1871 and 1916.|$|E
5|$|With Charles V {{distracted by}} the {{internal}} politics of his many kingdoms and external threats, and Henry and Francis on relatively good terms, domestic and not foreign policy issues had been Henry's <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{first half of the}} 1530s. In 1536, for example, Henry granted his assent to the Laws in Wales Act 1535, which legally annexed Wales, uniting England and Wales into a single nation. This was followed by the Second Succession Act (the Act of Succession 1536), which declared Henry's children by Jane to be next in the line of succession and declared both Mary and Elizabeth illegitimate, thus excluding them from the throne. The king was also granted the power to further determine the line of succession in his will, should he have no further issue. However, when Charles and Francis made peace in January 1539, Henry became increasingly paranoid, perhaps as a result of receiving a constant list of threats to the kingdom (real or imaginary, minor or serious) supplied by Cromwell in his role as spymaster. Enriched by the dissolution of the monasteries, Henry used some of his financial reserves to build a series of coastal defences and set some aside for use {{in the event of a}} Franco-German invasion.|$|E
