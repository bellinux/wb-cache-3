The variation in profile analysis {{can be divided into}} two kinds: variation due to profile level and variation due to profile pattern. The variation in the profile level or the level reliability is the proportion of total <b>profile</b> <b>variation</b> due to the true score variation in the level whereas the variation in the profile pattern or the pattern reliability is the proportion of total <b>profile</b> <b>variation</b> due to the true score variation in the pattern.

40|$|We analyse {{a series}} of {{high-resolution}} line pro files of He I 6678 in the periodic Be star 28 CMa. A simple zeroth-order approximation to the eigenfunctions is used to model the line <b>profile</b> <b>variations</b> in terms of non-radial pulsation. In addition, we use the best available theory for the eigenfunction in a rotating star. In all cases the calculated fits to the observed profiles are poor. We conclude that non-radial pulsation is almost certainly {{not responsible for the}} line <b>profile</b> <b>variations</b> in this star. In an attempt to understand the very large Line profile changes, but negligible light variation, we consider a 'patch' model. This consists of a circular area on the photosphere having the same temperature, but a different intrinsic line width. A simple model of this kind produces a good fit to the line <b>profile</b> <b>variations</b> and to the photometry. We conclude that modulation of the profile by a patch on, or close to, the photosphere may offer a plausible starting point for understanding the periodic variations in some Be stars. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|We {{extend the}} {{recently}} introduced Bayesian framework `Generative Pulsar Timing Analysis' to incorporate both pulse jitter (high frequency {{variation in the}} arrival time of the pulse) and epoch to epoch stochasticity {{in the shape of}} the pulse profile. This framework allows for a full timing analysis to be performed on the folded profile data, rather than the site arrival times as is typical in most timing studies. We apply this extended framework both to simulations, and to an 11 yr, 10 cm data set for PSR J 1909 - 3744. Using simulations, we show that temporal <b>profile</b> <b>variation</b> can induce timing noise in the residuals that when performing a standard timing analysis is highly covariant with the signal expected from a gravitational wave (GW) background. When working in the profile domain, these variations are de-correlated from the expected GW signal, resulting in significant improvement in the obtained upper limits. Using the PSR J 1909 - 3744 data set from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array project, we find significant evidence for systematic high-frequency <b>profile</b> <b>variation</b> resulting from non-Gaussian noise in the oldest observing system, but no evidence for either detectable pulse jitter, or low-frequency profile shape variation. Using our profile domain framework we therefore obtain upper limits on a red noise process with a spectral index of γ = 13 / 3 of 1 × 10 ^- 15, consistent with previously published limits.

40|$|We {{report the}} first {{comprehensive}} investigation of the line <b>profile</b> <b>variation</b> caused by non-radial pulsation in a magnetic oscillating chemically peculiar star. Spectrum variation of the well-known roAp star HR 3831 is detected using very high-resolution high signal-to-noise spectroscopic time-series observations and are followed through the whole rotation cycle of the star. We confirm outstanding diversity of pulsational behaviour of different lines in the HR 3831 spectrum and attribute this phenomenon to an interplay between extreme vertical chemical inhomogeneity of the HR 3831 atmosphere and a running pulsation wave, propagating towards the upper photospheric layers with increasing amplitude. Rapid <b>profile</b> <b>variation</b> of the NdIII 6145 A line is characterized by measuring changes of its equivalent width and the first three moments. We demonstrate that rotational modulation of the radial velocity oscillations cannot be fully explained by an oblique axisymmetric dipole (ell= 1, m= 0) mode, implied by the classical oblique pulsator model of roAp stars. Pulsational variation of the higher moments reveal substantial contribution of the high-order (ell= 3) spherical harmonics which appear due to distortion of pulsations in HR 3831 by the global magnetic field. We interpret observations with a novel numerical model of the pulsational variation and rotational modulation of the line profile moments in roAp stars. The comparison between observed and computed amplitudes and phases of the radial velocity and line width variation is used to establish parameters of the oblique pulsator model of HR 3831. Furthermore, definite detection of pulsational variation in lines of light and iron-peak elements enables the first 3 -D mapping of pulsations in non-radially oscillating star.
