50|$|Any {{extraction}} process {{will include a}} sequence of steps or unit processes for separating highly pure metals from undesirables in an economically efficient system. Unit processes are usually broken down into three categories: <b>pyrometallurgy,</b> hydrometallurgy, and electrometallurgy. In <b>pyrometallurgy,</b> the metal ore is first oxidized through roasting or smelting. The target metal is further refined at high temperatures and reduced to its pure form. In hydrometallurgy, the object metal is first dissociated from other materials using a chemical reaction, which is then extracted in pure form using electrolysis or precipitation. Finally, electrometallurgy generally involves electrolytic or electrothermal processing. The metal ore is either distilled in a electrolyte or acid solution, then magnetically deposited onto a cathode plate (electrowinning); or smelted then melted using an electric arc or plasma arc furnace (electrothermic reactor). Extractive metallurgy of ferrous and non-ferrous metals can involve <b>pyrometallurgy,</b> but chemical processes like hydrometallurgy and electrometallurgy are far more common in method of non-ferrous extraction.|$|E

50|$|Once the ore is mined, the metals must be extracted, {{usually by}} {{chemical}} or electrolytic reduction. <b>Pyrometallurgy</b> uses high temperatures to convert ore into raw metals, while hydrometallurgy employs aqueous chemistry {{for the same}} purpose.

50|$|The {{field of}} ferrous and {{non-ferrous}} extractive metallurgy have specialties that are generically grouped into {{the categories of}} mineral processing, hydrometallurgy, <b>pyrometallurgy,</b> and electrometallurgy based on the process adopted to extract the metal.

50|$|Ore {{concentrate}}, {{dressed ore}} or simply concentrate {{is the product}} generally produced by metal ore mines. The raw ore is usually ground finely in various comminution operations and gangue (waste) is removed, thus concentrating the metal component. The concentrate is then transported to various physical or chemical processes called hydrometallurgy, <b>pyrometallurgy</b> smelters, and electrometallurgy where {{it is used to}} produce useful metals.|$|E
5000|$|Hydrometallurgy is {{a method}} for obtaining metals from their ores. It is a {{technique}} {{within the field of}} extractive metallurgy involving the use of aqueous chemistry for the recovery of metals from ores, concentrates, and recycled or residual materials. [...] Metal chemical processing techniques that complement hydrometallurgy are <b>pyrometallurgy,</b> vapour metallurgy and molten salt electrometallurgy. Hydrometallurgy is typically divided into three general areas: ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pyrometallurgy</b> is {{a branch}} of {{extractive}} metallurgy. It consists of the thermal treatment of minerals and metallurgical ores and concentrates to bring about physical and chemical transformations in the materials to enable recovery of valuable metals. [...] Pyrometallurgical treatment may produce products able to be sold such as pure metals, or intermediate compounds or alloys, suitable as feed for further processing. Examples of elements extracted by pyrometallurgical processes include the oxides of less reactive elements like iron, copper, zinc, chromium, tin, and manganese.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{technologies}} are {{competing with the}} Kroll process. One process involves electrolysis of a molten salt. Problems with this process include [...] "redox recycling," [...] {{the failure of the}} diaphragm, and dendritic deposition in the electrolyte solution. Another process, the FFC Cambridge process, has been patented for a solid electrolytic solution, and its implementation would eliminate the titanium-sponge processing. Also in development is a pyrometallurgical route that involves the reduction of an intermediate form of titanium with aluminium. It combines the advantages of <b>pyrometallurgy</b> and a cheap reductant.|$|E

50|$|Matte is a {{term used}} {{in the field of}} <b>pyrometallurgy</b> given to the molten metal sulfide phases {{typically}} formed during smelting of copper, nickel, and other base metals. Typically, a matte is the phase in which the principal metal being extracted is recovered prior to a final reduction process (usually converting) to produce a crude metal. Mattes may also be used to collect impurities from a metal phase, such {{as in the case of}} antimony smelting. Molten mattes are insoluble in both slag and metal phases. This insolubility, combined with differences in specific gravities between mattes, slags, and metals, allows for separation of the molten phases.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pyrometallurgy</b> {{involves}} {{high temperature}} processes where chemical reactions take place among gases, solids, and molten materials. Solids containing valuable metals are treated to form intermediate compounds for further processing or converted into their elemental or metallic state. Pyrometallurgical processes that involve gases and solids are typified by calcining and roasting operations. Processes that produce molten products are collectively {{referred to as}} smelting operations. The energy required to sustain the high temperature pyrometallurgical processes may derive from the exothermic nature of the chemical reactions taking place. Typically, these reactions are oxidation, e.g. of sulfide to sulfur dioxide [...] Often, however, energy must {{be added to the}} process by combustion of fuel or, in the case of some smelting processes, by the direct application of electrical energy.|$|E

These include DC-are technology for ferroalloy smelting/melting; ilmenite smelting; ferronickel production from laterites; cobalt-copper recovery from furnace and converter slags; zinc recovery from slags and residues; ferro-alloy recovery from steel-plant dusts; matte and alloy smelting of low-sulphide high-chromium PGM concentrates; preheating; prereduction; smelting; fuming and condensing, and process modelling and simulation. The High Temperature Technology group of Pyro brings special {{skills to the}} pyrometallurgical processing environment, and carries out work on process development and optimisation for Mintek's Pyromettallurgy division and the local and international metallurgical industries. Activities include high temperature process development, solid-state and phase quilibrium studies of metallurgical systems at elevated temperatures, and investigations {{of the performance of}} refractory materials used in furnaces and ladles.|$|E
50|$|Electrometallurgy {{involves}} metallurgical {{processes that}} take place in some form of electrolytic cell. The most common types of electrometallurgical processes are electrowinning and electro-refining. Electrowinning is an electrolysis process used to recover metals in aqueous solution, usually as the result of an ore having undergone one or more hydrometallurgical processes. The metal of interest is plated onto the cathode, while the anode is an inert electrical conductor. Electro-refining is used to dissolve an impure metallic anode (typically from a smelting process) and produce a high purity cathode. Fused salt electrolysis is another electrometallurgical process whereby the valuable metal has been dissolved into a molten salt which acts as the electrolyte, and the valuable metal collects on the cathode of the cell. The fused salt electrolysis process is conducted at temperatures sufficient to keep both the electrolyte and the metal being produced in the molten state. The scope of electrometallurgy has significant overlap with the areas of hydrometallurgy and (in the case of fused salt electrolysis) <b>pyrometallurgy.</b> Additionally, electrochemical phenomena play a considerable role in many mineral processing and hydrometallurgical processes.|$|E

40|$|The {{roots of}} <b>pyrometallurgy</b> are obscure. This paper explores one {{possible}} precursor, in the Faynan Orefield in southern Jordan. There, at approximately 7000 cal. BP, banks of a near-perennial meandering stream (today represented by complex overbank wetland and anthropogenic deposits) were contaminated repeatedly by copper emitted by human activities. Variations {{in the distribution}} of copper in this sequence are not readily explained in other ways, although the precise mechanism of contamination remains unclear. The degree of copper enhancement was up to an order of magnitude greater than that measured in Pleistocene fluvial and paludal sediments, in contemporary or slightly older Holocene stream and pond deposits, and in the adjacent modern wadi braidplain. Lead is less enhanced, more variable, and appears to have been less influenced by contemporaneous human activities at this location. <b>Pyrometallurgy</b> in this region may have appeared as a byproduct of the activity practised on the stream-bank in the Wadi Faynan ~ 7000 years ago. authorsversionotherotherotherotherotherotherotherotherPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWaste from {{electronic}} and electrical equipment (WEEE) {{is one of}} the fastest growing waste streams, with its volume expected to increase by a third from 2013 to 2017. Lithium-ion batteries are the most common battery type used in portable electronic devices and their use is expected to double from 2013 - 14 to 2019 - 20. The recycling of lithium-ion batteries reduces energy consumption, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and results in considerable natural resource savings when compared to landfill. However, it is unclear which recycling processes have the least impact on the environment. This paper will investigate the different processes that are currently used for recycling portable lithium-ion batteries, such as hydrometallurgy, <b>pyrometallurgy,</b> and combinations of processes. Surveys are carried out to understand the materials recovered from each process, and are obtained from several recycling companies around the world. A comparative life cycle assessment will be performed for two different recycling processes (hydrometallurgy and <b>pyrometallurgy),</b> in order to understand the associated environmental impacts.
