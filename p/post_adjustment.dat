For example, ICSC calculated that U.

Growth that increases inequality may not reduce poverty; growth that does not change inequality (distribution-neutral growth) and growth that reduces inequality (pro-poor growth) result in poverty reduction. Policy makers can promote pro-poor growth by empowering the poor to participate in growth directly. Policy makers can focus on interventions that improve productivity in smallholder agriculture, particularly export crops, increasing employment of semi-skilled or unskilled labour, promoting technology adoption, increasing access to production assets, as well as effective participation in input and product markets.

40|$|Auditor-Client {{negotiation}} about difficult client {{accounting issues}} involves the auditor, the client, {{and various other}} parties on both the client and auditor side. On the auditor side, the Professional Practice Department {{has been reported to}} {{play a significant role in}} the financial reporting process, yet is rarely the focus of academic study. In this study, I investigate how communicating the involvement of the Professional Practice Department (PPD) to top management using different influence techniques impacts negotiated outcomes between audit partners and top management. I examine the impact of communicating the involvement of the PPD in the context of two other variables found in prior auditing literature to be important in the negotiation process, auditor type and CFO (Chief Financial Officer) preferred auditor-type. While auditors must attest that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, they also must ensure they foster a functional working relationship with the client. The auditor-client context is unique, and takes place within an on-going relationship where expectations and preferences have been established. Therefore, I examine these negotiation outcomes while incorporating a key contextual variable, auditor-type, in the negotiations. Both the CFO's preference for auditor-type, as well as actual auditor-type will be examined in addition to the specific influence tactic. I use a 3 x 2 x 2 fully factorial design to experimentally analyze the impact of two manipulated variable (influence tactic and auditor-type) and one measured variable (CFO preference for auditor-type) on two dependent variables. The two dependent variables are the CFO's willingness to <b>post</b> an <b>adjustment</b> to the financial statements and the CFO's satisfaction with the audit partner. I report the results of an audit negotiation experiment in which 154 highly experienced CFOs responded to a case scenario that incorporated or measured the three key variables (influence tactic communicating PPD involvement, auditor-type and CFO preference for auditor type). My results indicate that using the most aggressive influence tactic to communicate the Professional Practice Department's involvement had a mixed effect on the CFOs willingness to <b>post</b> <b>adjustments</b> to the financial statements. The CFOs in this influence condition that were paired with an accommodating auditor-type reported a higher willingness to adjust the financial statements while CFOs paired with a proactive and advising auditor-type reported a lower willingness to <b>post</b> <b>adjustments.</b> All CFOs reported less satisfaction with the audit partner when the most aggressive influence tactic was used to communicate the Professional Practice Department's inyolvement. Furthermore, the CFO's preference for an auditor-type significantly affects negotiation outcomes. CFOs that prefer more proactive and advising audit partners are more likely to <b>post</b> <b>adjustments</b> to the financial statements, regardless of whether or not. they are informed of the Professional Practice Department's involvement. These same CFOs report a high level of satisfaction with the audit partner and their satisfaction is not impacted by the type of audit partner they are paired with. CFOs that prefer more reactive and accommodating audit partners are less willing to adjust the financial statements and report less satisfaction (dissatisfaction), when paired with proactive and advising audit partners. These results highlight the importance of the existing relationship within the auditor-client dyads and help support findings from auditor-client negotiation research which show that prevailing expectations of the CFO are a contextually important feature of audit negotiation and should be incorporated into more research. I also show that aggressive tactics can help persuade some CFOs to adjust the financial statements; however, consistently pushing too aggressively results in reduced cooperation. Furthermore, there are large costs in terms of the CFO's satisfaction with the audit partner in using aggressive tactics, and therefore, practically speaking the tactic that could potentially be the most effective may result in a lost client...|$|R

Cost overruns and project delays {{have long been}} chronic difficulties in implementing infrastructure projects. Too many ex <b>post</b> <b>adjustments</b> not only incur significant adaptation costs to contractors but also undermine efficiency, credibility and predictability of the budget execution. The paper analyzes the case of public road procurement in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is found that if large post-award amendments are anticipated, bidders are likely to reflect them to their bids systematically. Under the perfect foresight assumption, one dollar of anticipated contract adjustment would decrease the bid strategy by 7 cents; the effect seems to be offset largely by the incurred adaptation cost to contractors, which is estimated at 93 cents per one dollar of contract adjustment. Therefore, the ex post adaptation approach is much costly, {{and it may be}} better to formulate the accurate budget on a more solid basis and use the agreed contract as high-powered incentives to contractors.

We here show that this first order approximation is not always valid if used naïvely. We find that such approximations require an ex <b>post</b> <b>adjustment</b> involving asymptotic likelihood ratios. These are given.

The first order approximations in this study can be over the period of one observation, or over blocks of successive observations.

Practically, the procedure permits (1) the definition of estimators of hard to reach quantities, such as the leverage effect, (2) the improvement in efficiency in classical estimators, and (3) easy analysis. More conceptually, we show that the approximation induces a measure change similar to that occurring in options pricing theory. In particular, localization over one observation induces a measure change related to the leverage effect, while localization over a block of observations creates an effect that connects to the volatility of volatility. Another conceptual gain is the relationship to Hermite polynomials. The three measure changes mentioned relate, respectively, to the first, third, and second such polynomial...|$|E

A proxy is someone other than the respondent who completes the survey for the respondent. Methods The propensity score method of matched sampling was used to compare proxy and self-completed responses. A propensity score is a value that equals the estimated probability of a given individual belonging to a treatment group given the observed background characteristics of that individual. Proxy and self-completed responses were compared on demographics, the SF- 36, chronic conditions, activities of daily living, and depression-screening questions. For each individual survey respondent, logistic regression was used to calculate the probability that this individual belonged to the proxy respondent group (propensity score). Pre and <b>post</b> <b>adjustment</b> comparisons were tested by calculating effect sizes. Results Differences between self and proxy-completed responses were substantially reduced with {{the use of}} the propensity score method. However, differences were still found in the SF- 36, several demographics, several impaired activities of daily living, several chronic conditions, and one depression-screening question. Conclusion The propensity score method helped to reduce differences between proxy-completed and self-completed survey responses, thereby providing an approximation to a randomized controlled experiment of proxy-completed versus self-completed survey responses. </p...|$|E

It is available for differentially detecting three-axis angular rates simultaneously. To overcome the coupling between drive and sense modes, numerous necessary frames, beams, and anchors are delicately figured out and properly arranged. Besides, some frequency tuning and feedback mechanisms are addressed {{in the case of}} post processing after fabrication.

In a nutshell the main results are: i) risk adjusted capital ratios are negatively related to the asset quality review shortfall {{but not to the}} stress test shortfall, instead the leverage ratio always plays a significant role; ii) the comprehensive assessment was mainly concentrated on the traditional credit activity rather than on the financial assets of the banks; iii) there is evidence of manipulation in the computation of risk weighted assets by the use of internal rating based models; iv) the comprehensive assessment seems to be characterized by double standards: non-core countries have been penalized by the asset quality review; medium size banks are either more risky or have been penalized in both exercises; a non diversification-home bias effect (including government bonds) has penalized banks in the asset quality review; the use of national discretion helped core countries and was not of help for peripheral countries. As far as the methodology is concerned, several pitfalls emerge. However, we show that the capital adjustment performed by the stress test is positively related to a market based risk measure (historical volatility) and that the leverage ratio <b>post</b> <b>adjustment,</b> but not before the adjustment and not the risk adjusted capital ratio, is related to it...|$|E

(Chiropractic) Purpose: To {{establish}} the immediate effect of sacroiliac joint adjustment on functional leg length Method: Seventy participants were randomly divided in two equal groups. Participants of Group A (n= 35) leg length was measured pre and immediately <b>post</b> <b>adjustment</b> of dysfunctional sacroiliac joint. Group B (n= 35) {{received the same}} assessment protocol with no adjustment being administered. The trial consisted of one treatment session only in which all data was obtained. Objective data consisted of measuring participant’s leg length from the anterior superior iliac spine to {{the apex of the}} medial malleolus using the standardized tape measure method. Subjective data was obtained through performing four sacroiliac joint orthopaedic tests or each participant’s and recording the results. Results: The subjective results showed positive results in at least three out of four of the orthopedic tests for the participants of both groups. The sacral thrust technique and sacroiliac joint compression showed a greater percentage positive result in Group A at 91. 4 % where as the sacroiliac joint distraction was positive in 94. 3 % of the participants in Group B. Gaenslen’s showed the least accuracy with a positive result in 82. 9 % of participants in Group A and 74. 3 % in Group B. Objectively, Shapiro-Wilk analysis indicated a statistically significant (p = 0. 014) change in the length of the left leg after treatment in Group A. A significant change in the length of both the right (p = 0. 002) and left (p = 0. 034) leg was found in Group B following assessment. Conclusion: The study showed that adjustment of the sacroiliac joint does not consistently result in change in functional leg length inequality. This information suggests that the assessment of functional leg length should not be used as the sole assessment tool in the diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction. Practitioners should rather incorporate a variety of assessment methods as the inequality may be caused by factors unrelated to the dysfunction...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{framework}} in which the effect of divorce in late life could be examined. Statistics indicate a growing number of persons who occupy the divorce status in late life. Many of these persons enter late life in the divorced status, others are divorced after age 60. This study focuses upon those who divorce after age 60. Although previous work does not shed much light upon late life divorce, it yields a clear picture of the characteristics, process and consequences of divorce for younger persons. Assumptions derived from work with younger divorcing populations provide a basis for the conceptual framework used in this study. A description of who gets divorced, causes, process and consequences of divorce in late life is provided. A model which predicts <b>post</b> divorce <b>adjustment</b> also is tested. Findings affirm similarities between younger and older divorcing persons. Persons divorcing in late life generally were urban residing, had low occupational status, few assets, weak religious and kinship ties. Generally, in this study divorce resulted from a long-standing lack of emotional gratification aggravated by some type of precipitating event.
