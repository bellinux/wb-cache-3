40|$|This paper {{presents}} an original typology of diaspora <b>engagement</b> <b>policies</b> intended to facilitate comparative research. The typology is arises from a two part argument: a) that diaspora <b>engagement</b> <b>policies</b> {{consist of a}} diversity of measures aimed at (re) producing citizen-sovereign relationships with expatriates, and b) that these measures can be coordinated as part of states’ attempts to manage the scale of their political and economic manoeuvres. By using the typology to systematically review the diaspora <b>engagement</b> <b>policies</b> of over 70 states, the paper questions four key assumptions in existing literature on diaspora <b>engagement</b> <b>policies,</b> establishing that they are compatible with two models of citizenship, and arguing {{that they are not}} confined to any one kind of state.

40|$|China is, {{and will}} {{continue}} to be for some time to come, a great concern to U. S. administrations. The Clinton administration has chosen to pursue a <b>policy</b> of <b>engagement</b> with China, arguing that it is best to try to bring China into “the community of nations” rather than to contain and isolate it. Integrating China through a <b>policy</b> of <b>engagement</b> has meant, most importantly, the maintenance and expansion of American trade with, and the encouragement of investments in, China. There have been some limits to the administration’s policy though, for a tough line has been taken toward China on membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and on the piracy of intellectual property (e. g., compact discs and videos). Engagement empowers pacific economic internationalists in China, while containment would likely bring to the fore more aggressive political and economic interests. What are the security implications of such a policy? This paper focuses on the impact that America’s economic relations in the <b>policy</b> of <b>engagement</b> with China have had, and will likely have, on the nature of Chinese foreign policy and on U. S. –Chinese security relations. In short, we argue that a <b>policy</b> of <b>engagement</b> will have beneficial consequences. Such a policy empowers more pacific economic internationalists in China, while containment would likely weaken those forces and might bring to the fore more aggressive political and economic interests. The risks of engagement are also insignificant in the near term. Because U. S. economic stakes in China are fairly small, they do not carry the danger of tying the hands of U. S. leaders should the Chinese pursue conflictual policies that require the United States to balance against China. A <b>policy</b> of <b>engagement</b> thus promises greater benefits than containment, with few risks...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, the {{question}} of migration {{has come to the}} forefront of the international agenda through a number of important events and policy initiatives devoted to what has been referred to as the migration-development nexus. Against this backdrop, many governments in Africa have developed policies and strategies aimed at engaging their diasporas in the development process. Diaspora <b>engagement</b> <b>policies</b> have thus become a primary channel through which migrant source states are interacting with their diasporas. The paper seeks to offer a comparative analysis of these national efforts and assess their soundness in regard to the best practices and the body of knowledge that has emerged from the field of diaspora <b>engagement</b> <b>policies</b> research. Using Alan Gamlens typology of diaspora <b>engagement</b> <b>policies</b> in comparative research, the focus of this paper is on three high-level sets of policies aimed respectively at a) building capacity; b) extending rights to the diaspora; c) extracting obligations from the diaspora. I contend that these diaspora <b>engagement</b> <b>policies</b> are not only changing the political landscape and institutional architecture of many states, they are also subtly reframing the basic terms of citizenship and sovereignty to which we have been accustomed...|$|R
