5000|$|The BBC {{would later}} {{describe}} the bombing as {{a turning point}} in the Troubles because the attack shook the IRA [...] "to its core". Pivotal to the change in attitude towards this sort of attack was Wilson's reaction to the death of his daughter. The 60-year-old draper publicly forgave those who had planted the bomb and said he would <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> He <b>also</b> begged that no-one take revenge for Marie's death and pleaded with loyalists not to do so.|$|R
5000|$|The idea of Purgatory as a {{physical}} place was [...] "born" [...] in the late 11th century. Medieval Catholic theologians concluded that the purgatorial punishments consisted of material fire. The Catholic Church believes that the living can help those whose purification from their sins is not yet completed not only by <b>praying</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> but <b>also</b> by gaining indulgences <b>for</b> <b>them</b> {{as an act of}} intercession. All Souls' Day commemorates the souls in purgatory. The Late Middle Ages saw the growth of considerable abuses, such as the unrestricted sale of indulgences by professional [...] "pardoners" [...] to release the donors' departed loved ones from suffering in purgatory, or the donors themselves.|$|R
5000|$|The Trust was {{established}} {{in the aftermath of the}} Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) bombing of the centotaph in Enniskillen on Remembrance Sunday, 8 November 1987, which killed 11 people. The atrocity could have provoked a wave of revenge attacks, but the Trust built itself on the words and deeds of Gordon Wilson, who lost his daughter Marie (aged 20) in the explosion. The BBC has described the bombing as a turning point in The Troubles, and an attack that shook the IRA [...] "to its core". Pivotal to turning point was Wilson's reaction to the murder of his daughter Marie in an interview that he gave to the BBC only hours after her death. Wilson forgave the terrorists and said he would <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> He <b>also</b> begged that no-one took revenge for Marie's death and pleaded with Loyalists not to do so.|$|R
2500|$|The idea of Purgatory as a {{physical}} place (like heaven and hell) was [...] "born" [...] in the late 11th century. Medieval theologians concluded that the purgatorial punishments consisted of material fire. The Western formulation of purgatory {{proved to be a}} sticking point in the Great Schism between East and West. The Catholic Church believes that the living can help those whose purification from their sins is not yet completed not only by <b>praying</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> but <b>also</b> by gaining indulgences <b>for</b> <b>them</b> as an act of intercession. The later Middle Ages saw the growth of considerable abuses, such as the unrestricted sale of indulgences by professional [...] "pardoners" [...] sent to collect contributions to projects such as the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. These abuses were one of the factors that led to the Protestant Reformation. Most Protestants rejected the idea of purgatory, as never clearly mentioned in Luther's canon of the Bible, which excludes the Deuterocanonical books. Modern Catholic theologians have softened the punitive aspects of purgatory and stress instead the willingness of the dead to undergo purification as preparation for the happiness of heaven ...|$|R

Christ has {{forbidden}} his people to <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> that have sinned that sin; and, therefore, will not <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> himself, but he <b>prays</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> that come.|$|R
