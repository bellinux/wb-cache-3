40|$|Although a {{considerable}} amount of research exists on geometrical aspects of 5 -axis flank milling, the dynamics of this efficient milling operation have not yet been given proper attention. In particular, investigating machining chatter in 5 -axis flank milling remains as an open problem in the literature. The axial depth of cut in this operation is typically quite large, which makes it prone to machining chatter. In this thesis, chatter in 5 -axis flank milling is studied by developing analytical methods of examining vibration stability, generating numerical simulations of the process, and conducting experimental investigations. The typical application of 5 -axis milling includes the machining of thermal resistant steel alloys at low cutting speeds, where the process damping dominates the machining vibration. The results of experimental study in this thesis showed that the effect of process damping is even stronger in flank milling due to the long axial engagement. Accordingly, {{the first part of the}} thesis is devoted to studying process damping, and in the second part, the modeling of chatter in flank milling is presented. Linear and nonlinear models have been reported in the literature that account for process damping. Although linear models are easier to implement in predicting stability limits, they could lead to misinterpretation of the actual status of the cut. On the other hand, nonlinear damping models are difficult to implement for stability estimation analytically, yet they allow the prediction of “finite amplitude stability” from time domain simulations. This phenomenon of “finite amplitude stability” has been demonstrated in the literature using numerical simulations. In this thesis, that phenomenon is investigated experimentally. The experimental work focuses on uninterrupted cutting, in particular <b>plunge</b> <b>turning,</b> to avoid unduly complications associated with transient vibration. The experiments confirm that, because of the nonlinearity of the process damping, the transition from fully stable to fully unstable cutting occurs gradually over a range of width of cut. The experimental investigation is followed by developing a new formulation for process damping based on the indentation force model. Then, the presented formulation is used to compute the stability lobes in <b>plunge</b> <b>turning,</b> taking into account the effect of nonlinear process damping. The developed lobes could be established for different amplitudes of vibration. This is a departure from the traditional notion that the stability lobes represent a single boundary between fully stable and fully unstable cutting conditions. Moreover, the process damping model is integrated into the Multi-Frequency Solution and the Semi Discretization Method to establish the stability lobes in milling. The basic formulations are presented along with comparisons between the two approaches, using examples from the literature. A non-shallow cut is employed in the comparisons. Assessing the performance of the two methods is conducted using time domain simulations. It is shown that the Semi Discretization Method provides accurate results over the whole tested range of cutting speed, whereas higher harmonics are required to achieve the same accuracy when applying the Multi Frequency Solution at low speeds. Semi Discretization method is modified further to calculate the stability lobes in flank milling with tools with helical teeth. In addition to the tool helix angle and long axial immersion, the effect of instantaneous chip thickness on the cutting force coefficients is considered in the modified formulation of Semi Discretization as well. Considering the effect of chip thickness variation on the cutting force coefficients is even more important in the modeling of 5 -axis flank milling, where the feedrate, and consequently the chip thickness, varies at each cutter location. It also varies along the tool axis due to the additional rotary and tilt axis. In addition to the feedrate, the tool and workpiece engagement geometry varies at each cutter location as well. The actual feedrate at each cutter location is calculated by the dynamic processing of the toolpath. The tool and workpiece engagement geometry is calculated analytically using the parametric formulation of grazing surface at the previous and current passes. After calculating the instantaneous chip thickness and tool/workpiece engagement geometry, they are integrated into the Semi Discretization Method in 5 -axis flank milling to examine the stability of vibration at each cutter location. While the presented chatter analysis results in establishing stability lobes in 3 -axis flank milling, it results in developing a novel approach in presenting the stability of the cut in 5 -axis flank milling. The new approach, namely “stability maps”, determines the unstable cutter locations of the toolpath at each spindle speed. The accuracy of established 3 -axis flank milling stability lobes and 5 -axis stability maps is verified by conducting a set of cutting experiments and numerical simulations...|$|E
40|$|With {{increased}} {{application of}} mechanical micromachining for creating small features with complex geometries {{on a broad}} range of materials, the need for understanding the mechanics of machining at the micro-scale has been recognized. During mechanical micromachining of metals, the tool-workpiece interaction occurs entirely within either a single crystal or a few crystals of the workpiece material. Consequently, the crystallographic properties (e. g., anisotropy) of individual crystals strongly affect the machining response, including micromachining forces and resulting surface finish. Hence, the crystallographic effects that are generally neglected (due to the perceived isotropic nature of the workpiece) in macro-scale machining need to be studied both experimentally and theoretically for gaining {{a better understanding of the}} micromachining process. This thesis aims to understand the effects of crystallographic anisotropy on machining response of face centered cubic metals through physics-based modeling and experimental analysis. The thesis begins with an introduction to micromachining and the associated crystallographic effects on the micromachining response. Subsequently, a literature review is presented and the shortcomings of the available research are identified. In particular, (a) the lack of physically realistic machining force models incorporating the effects of anisotropy, and (b) a necessity for experimental data analyzing the effect of anisotropy over {{a broad range of}} machining conditions, are addressed. The work is performed in three stages, with the first two addressing the former, and the last one addressing the latter shortcoming. First, a simplified machining force model incorporating the effects of anisotropy is developed by combining a plasticity theory and the Merchant 2 ̆ 7 s machining model. Since the deformation geometry is unknown a-priori in machining operations, a shear angle determination scheme is necessary before predicting the forces. For a given crystallographic orientation, the model considers the minimization of the total power, including the shearing (plastic) and rake-face friction power, to determine the shear angle and predict the machining forces. The calculation of shearing power is performed using the Bishop and Hill 2 ̆ 7 s plasticity theory, thus incorporating the effects of anisotropy. The model is calibrated and validated using the available (but limited) machining force data from the literature. An analysis of the model is also performed to observe the effects of orientation, friction angle and rake angle. The simplified model neglected the effects of hardening and lattice rotation observed during large strain deformation (such as that experienced in machining). Second, a more physically realistic rate sensitive plasticity-based machining (RSPM) force model is developed to enhance the simplified model by incorporating the hardening and lattice rotation effects. Similar to the simplified model, minimization of the total power (sum of plastic and friction power) is used to determine the shear angle. When calculating the required plastic power, rate-sensitive constitutive equations with hardening and kinematics of single crystal deformation (including lattice rotation) are used. The obtained shear angle is then used to predict the machining forces. The RSPM model is calibrated using the Kriging-algorithm-based SuperEGO (efficient global optimization) code to obtain the five material parameters required. Both the calibration and the subsequent validation are performed using the machining force data available in the literature. Use of the RSPM model improved the match with the experiments over the use of the simplified model. The RSPM model is then used to analyze the effects of orientation, rake angle, coefficient of friction and material properties on machining forces. Third, to address the need for comprehensive experimental data and analysis, a precision turning and a precision planing apparatus are designed and constructed. Initial machining experiments performed on single crystal and coarse-grained polycrystal aluminum showed that the machining force and surface finish values vary strongly with crystallographic orientations. A measurement of deformation below the cut surface also indicated the importance of measuring the subsurface deformation in future studies. Subsequently, a comprehensive study on the effect of anisotropy over a range of cutting parameters is performed for coarse-grained polycrystal aluminum. In these experiments, in addition to the machining parameters, the effect of subsurface deformation is studied by comparing experimental results from cases with and without cleanup cut. The results from these experiments quantified the effects of crystallographic anisotropy, its interaction with machining parameters and the effect of sub surface deformation on machining forces and surface finish. The thesis concludes with a discussion of future work covering both modeling and experimental aspects of the research. The future work is divided into near term and long term future work, where the near term work includes planing and <b>plunge</b> <b>turning</b> experiments on single crystals and the extension of the RSPM model to oblique machining. In the longer term, modifications to the machining force model to include the non-homogeneity of the shear zone, and extension of the model to three dimensional machining operations like milling are proposed. The fundamental contributions of this thesis research are focused on modeling and experimental investigations on single-crystal and coarse-grained materials. Specific contributions include; (1) A simplified machining model that includes the crystallographic anisotropy; (2) A comprehensive rate-sensitive plasticity-based machining force model including hardening and crystal rotation effects and large deformations; (3) An experimental infrastructure, including precision planing and plunge-turning testbeds, to facilitate experimental investigations and model validations in the presence of crystallographic effects; and (4) An experimental understanding on the effects of crystallography when micro-machining single-crystal and coarse-grained materials...|$|E

60|$|The two armies now {{prepared}} for battle. The King of France clothed {{himself in his}} royal armor, and nineteen of his knights were armed in the same manner, {{in order to prevent}} the enemy from being able to single out the king on the field. This was a common stratagem employed on such occasions. The English were strongly posted on a hill side, among vineyards and groves. The approach to their position was through a sort of lane bordered by hedges. The English archers were posted along these hedges, and when the French troops attempted to advance, the archers poured such a shower of barbed arrows into the horses' sides, that they soon threw them into confusion. The barbed arrows could not be withdrawn, and the horses, terrified with the stinging pain, would rear, and <b>plunge,</b> and <b>turn</b> round upon those behind them, until at length the lane was filled with horses and horsemen piled together in confusion. Now, when once a scene of confusion like this occurred upon a field of battle, it was almost impossible to recover from it, for the iron armor which these knights wore was so heavy and so cumbersome, that when once they were unhorsed they could not mount again, and sometimes could not even rise, but writhed and struggled helplessly on the ground until their squires came to relieve them.|$|R

In most machine shops, the profit margin is typically quite low. Optimized processing is required to ensure a profit. Simulation of metal-cutting processes provides substantial opportunities for enhancing throughput, decreasing costs and improving product quality. The use of computer simulations to avoid unstable cutting processes is one area where significant gains can be realized. Time domain simulation models were developed for both <b>plunge</b> feed <b>turning</b> and slender endmilling. Simulations were conducted using C++ computer programs. Chatter (i. e., excessive tool vibration) is shown to exist beyond a stability limit of chip width for both cases. Sinusoidal varying tool displacements are demonstrated to contribute to regenerative surface waviness (i. e., causing varying chip thickness) for all chip widths. A nominal tool displacement that is proportional to chip width arises due to the tool compliance and force exerted on the tool. When chip widths are below a limiting size for stability, displacement amplitudes decay towards the nominal tool displacement value. For chip widths at the stability limit, a constant amplitude of the tool displacement around the nominal value occurs. A constant growth of the displacement amplitude occurs for chip widths above the stability limit. Generally, the growth rate in the amplitude is fester for larger amounts of excessive chip widths. However, the amplitude growth is limited when the tool momentarily and repeatedly leaves the cut corresponding to chatter. Experimental verification was performed utilizing a Kistler force dynamometer, a Tektronix data acquisition system, a Renault lathe and a Mori-Seiki machining center. Good correlation was achieved between experiments and simulations. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R
