50|$|Prior to {{his career}} as a {{motorcycle}} builder, Arlen worked as a <b>pin</b> <b>setter</b> at the local bowling alley, and later as a post office worker and furniture mover. Ness also competed in semi-professional bowling leagues, the earnings of which he used to buy his first motorcycle, a 1947 Harley-Davidson Knucklehead that he later customized.|$|E
5000|$|Tom then uses a {{towel and}} powder before {{throwing}} another ball at Jerry, but Jerry picks up a pin and hits the ball back at Tom. The ball flies toward Tom, who backs up to catch it, only for the ball to hit him and make the cat crash through the floor. With the pins reloaded, Jerry waves at the cat. Tom throws the ball at Jerry, but his thumb gets stuck and he slides down the lane with the ball, bowling down all the pins. Jerry hangs onto the <b>pin</b> <b>setter,</b> which turns Tom into a bowling pin.|$|E
5000|$|During the game, the elves say {{phrases such as}} [...] "Is {{that all}} the balls you got, Santa?" [...] when the player misses their first spare {{opportunity}} or [...] "Gutter ball!" [...] in a silly-sounding voice when a ball is rolled into the gutter. Other potential distractions for the user are a Reindeer that walks up along the bowling lane that can be [...] "hit" [...] with the bowling ball if the arrow is positioned to the far left, and a frog wearing a Santa hat hopping {{back and forth across}} the player's field of vision (resembling Kalvin Kroaker from Frogapult, also made by Nstorm). If one hits the frog with the bowling ball, his body is hauled away from the screen by a bird from Frogapult. A white rabbit also jumps and defecates across the bowling lane. The elves moon Santa (asking [...] "who's your daddy" [...] as they do it). Both during the game and after a game finishes, the elves do a dance, shouting [...] "Elf elf, baby!" [...] in reference to Vanilla Ice's song [...] "Ice Ice Baby". The elves can also randomly move out of the way of the ball, and one elf can be decapitated by the <b>pin</b> <b>setter.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The game {{continues}} and Sam goes to {{the bathroom}} so she can [...] "freshen up". The person who murdered Dave and Julia is hiding {{in one of the}} stalls when Sam enters the girls' restroom and Sam, frightened by the noise coming from the stall, approaches it and is pulled inside. She tries to bargain with the killer, but the killer murders her by forcing a bowling pin down her throat. The killer lifts Sam's skirt up and, using the switchblade Sam tried to defend herself with, castrates Sam lengthwise. Later, Ben and Cindy leave to have sex in a storage room upstairs, but Ben leaves Cindy alone to buy a condom from the vending machine in the bathroom. He dies when the killer hits him over the head with a bowling pin and gouges his eyes out with a sharpened one. The killer finds Cindy upstairs and strangles her to death with a pair of bowling sneakers. Downstairs, Hannah searches for Julia but dies when the killer crushes her head with two bowling balls. Joey goes back behind the <b>pin</b> <b>setters</b> to fix his team's after noticing they were broken. A.J. notices the strikes appearing next to BBK on the scoreboard and questions Egerton about it, who assures him that it is still a glitch. Egerton sends A.J. to an area currently being remodeled with an [...] "out of order" [...] sign to put on an automatic ball polisher that Joey broke earlier. A.J. turns the ball polisher on and finds it already fixed but gets killed when the killer uses it to wax his face off.|$|R
5000|$|Steve, {{noticing that}} {{something}} is amiss, leaves to find Joey behind the <b>pin</b> <b>setters.</b> Joey lies dead on the ground, headless. Steve is frightened by the killer, who bludgeons him with a bowling pin before sodomizing him with another sharpened pin. As Steve tries to crawl away, the killer smashes his head in with the bowling pin. Meanwhile, Sarah and Jamie continue their game. Jamie reaches into the ball return slot to find his bowling ball, instead discovering Joey's severed head. The two try desperately to escape the bowling alley before coming {{face to face with}} the killer. They run and hide in the basement, where they find their friends' bodies. The killer appears with a shotgun and removes the bowling bag to reveal Egerton's face. Sarah discovers that Jamie knew about the murders of Steve, Joey, and A.J. but not the others. Lisa appears, dressed up as well, revealing that she murdered Steve. Jamie explains that Lisa told her father, who turns out to be Egerton, about the rape and Egerton let Jamie in on the plan. When asked why he killed their friends too, Egerton explains that they didn't intervene when Lisa reentered the bowling alley and are therefore just as guilty. Another person dressed like the killer, as Egerton goes on to explain, Another killer (possibly the real [...] "BBK") enters the basement and removes the bowling bag to reveal Patrick's face. Patrick explains that he confessed his involvement to Egerton and wanted to contact the police, but Egerton let him in on the plan instead and he was the person who murdered Joey and A.J., supposedly to make it up to her. Lisa is furious that her father allowed him to live so Egerton betrays Patrick and slits his throat with the switchblade he got from Sam. Jamie, realizing he's out of control, wrestles Egerton to the ground and, after a scuffle, blows his head clean off with the shotgun. Lisa cradles her father's body before grabbing the switchblade and trying to attack Jamie. Sarah grabs the shotgun and kills Lisa.|$|R
