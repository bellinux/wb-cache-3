40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} how <b>prescribers</b> and pharmacists use and perceive the drug-drug interaction database SFINX in their clinical work. Methods: A questionnaire was developed with questions aimed at the usage of SFINX, and the perceptions of the database. The questionnaire was sent out to all registered users of the web application of SFINX. The anonymous answers from the target users, <b>prescribers</b> and pharmacists were summarized using descriptive statistics. Statistical analysis was performed on age and gender differences for some questions regarding different usage patterns. Results: The questionnaire was sent to 11, 763 registered SFINX users. The response rate was 23 %, including 1871 answers from <b>prescribers</b> or pharmacists. SFINX was reported to be used at least weekly or more often by 45 % of the <b>prescribers</b> and 51 % of the pharmacists. Many <b>prescribers</b> reported using the database during the patient consultation (60 %) or directly before or after (56 %). Among the <b>prescribers,</b> 74 % reported that the information received made them change their action at least sometimes. About 20 % of the <b>prescribers</b> and 25 % of the pharmacists considered the information as irrelevant sometimes or more often. Conclusion: Most <b>prescribers</b> and pharmacists reported using SFINX in direct association with a patient consultation. Information received by using SFINX makes <b>prescribers</b> and pharmacists change their handling of patients. DDI databases with relevant information about patient handling might improve drug treatment outcome. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} diagnostic labeling of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and antibiotic prescription rates in family practice. DESIGN Descriptive analysis of outpatient chart review supplemented by interviews with physicians. Charts of patients attending 73 general practitioners were reviewed between October 1997 and February 1998. Two days of practice were evaluated per physician. SETTING Urban family practices in greater St John’s, Nfld. PARTICIPANTS Of 96 family physicians contacted, 73 (76 %) agreed to participate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Rates of diagnoses and antibiotic prescriptions for acute infections. Physicians were divided into “low <b>prescribers</b> ” and “high <b>prescribers</b> ” based on overall rates of prescription to patients with infections. Low <b>prescribers</b> were compared with high <b>prescribers</b> with respect to physician characteristics, patient characteristics, and diagnoses assigned. RESULTS Of all patients seen, 22 % were seen for acute infections; RTIs accounted for 76 % of diagnoses. Low <b>prescribers</b> and high <b>prescribers</b> were of similar ages and saw similar numbers of patients of similar ages with very similar presenting complaints. Both groups diagnosed urinary tract and skin and soft-tissue infections at similar rates, but differed markedly in their rates of diagnoses of RTIs. High <b>prescribers</b> diagnosed bacterial RTIs in 65. 4 % (147 / 225) of their patients; low <b>prescribers</b> diagnosed bacterial RTIs in 31. 0 % (66 / 213) (P <. 001). CONCLUSION Family doctors frequently prescribe antibiotics. The difference in rates of prescription between high <b>prescribers</b> and low <b>prescribers</b> is largely explained by assignment of diagnoses of RTIs.

40|$|Background: Drug-drug {{interactions}} (DDIs) are {{an important}} and preventable cause of medication errors in hospitals. Recent developments in technology have seen new strategies emerge for preventing DDIs but these computerized strategies are rarely evaluated and are typically implemented with little input from the individuals using them. Aim: To determine the opinions of both experts and users (<b>prescribers)</b> on computerized strategies available {{to assist in the}} identification and prevention of DDIs in hospitals. Method: Eight drug safety experts and 18 <b>prescribers</b> took part in semi-structured interviews. Participants were asked about their confidence in identifying DDIs and their views on potential computerized strategies to prevent DDIs. Results: No <b>prescribers</b> reported complete confidence in identifying dangerous DDIs, with junior <b>prescribers</b> appearing less confident than senior <b>prescribers.</b> Most <b>prescribers</b> believed that computerized alerts would be the most effective strategy for preventing DDIs, while experts were more critical of alerts. Conclusion: The lack of confidence displayed by <b>prescribers</b> in their ability to identify DDIs suggests that an appropriate strategy would be one that does not rely on individuals seeking out the information themselves. While a large number of problems related to DDI alert implementation {{have been reported in the}} literature (e. g. alert overload), <b>prescribers</b> appeared to be receptive to the idea of being alerted. By ensuring users are aware of the limitations of the system and involving them in DDI strategy design we expect greater use and satisfaction with the adopted strategy. 6 page(s...|$|R

Such forms are thought to reduce errors, especially omission and handwriting errors and are actively under evaluation. (See: Kennedy AG, Littenberg B.

2500|$|Many {{brand name}} drugs have cheaper generic drug {{substitutes}} that are therapeutically and biochemically equivalent.

2500|$|Prescriptions {{are also}} used for {{things that are not}} {{strictly}} regulated as a prescription drug. Prescribers will often give non-prescription drugs out as prescriptions because drug benefit plans may reimburse the patient only if the over-the-counter medication is taken under the direction of a medical practitioner. Conversely, if a medication is available over-the-counter, prescribers may ask patients if they want it as a prescription or purchase it themselves. Pharmacists {{may or may not be}} able to price the medication competitively with over-the-counter equivalents. If the patient wants the medication not under prescription, the <b>prescriber</b> is usually careful to give the medication name to the patient on a blank piece of paper to avoid any confusion with a prescription. [...] This is applied to non-medications as well. For example, crutches, and registered massage therapy may be reimbursed under some health plans, but only if given out by a <b>prescriber</b> as a prescription.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} threat to medical dominance posed {{by the addition of}} pharmacists as <b>prescribers</b> in the UK. It explores the role of prescribing as an indicator of professional power, the legitimacy and status of new pharmacist <b>prescribers</b> and the forces influencing professional jurisdictional claims over the task of prescribing. It draws upon 23 interviews with pharmacist supplementary <b>prescribers.</b> Data suggest that the legitimacy of pharmacists as <b>prescribers,</b> as experienced in the workplace, has been aided by: (1) blurred definitions of prescribing; (2) the emphasis on new prescribers' competence urging pharmacist <b>prescribers</b> to limit their areas of clinical practice; and (3) a team approach to patient management. Competence, self-limitation on practice and the benefits of team working as part of the ideology of patient safety were thus an important influence on pharmacists' jurisdictional claim over prescribing. While pharmacists have successfully negotiated a role for themselves as <b>prescribers,</b> medicine has retained its high status, relative to other health professionals and with patients; it controls the knowledge base relevant for prescribing practice and has managed to develop an 'overseer' role over the process of prescribing. Prescribing, as an indicator of medicine's autonomy of control over their work and professional status, has changed. Yet the extent to which new <b>prescribers</b> have been able to threaten the professional dominance of medicine is debatable...|$|R

They flatter themselves that the extreme misery brought upon the people by their folly will at last open {{the eyes of}} the multitude, if not of their leaders. Much the contrary, I fear. As to the leaders in this system of imposture,--you know that cheats and deceivers never can repent. The fraudulent have no resource but in fraud. They have no other goods in their magazine. They have no virtue or wisdom in their minds, to which, in a disappointment concerning the profitable effects of fraud and cunning, they can retreat. The wearing out of an old serves only to put them upon the invention of a new delusion. Unluckily, too, the credulity of dupes is as inexhaustible as the invention of knaves. They never give people possession; but they always keep them in hope. Your state doctors do not so much as pretend that any good whatsoever has hitherto been derived from their operations, or that the public has prospered in any one instance under their management. The nation is sick, very sick, by their medicines. But the charlatan tells them that what is past cannot be helped;--they have taken the draught, and they must wait its operation with patience;--that the first effects, indeed, are unpleasant, but that the very sickness is a proof that the dose is of no sluggish operation;--that sickness is inevitable in all constitutional revolutions;--that the body must pass through pain to ease;--that the <b>prescriber</b> is not an empiric who proceeds by vulgar experience, but one who grounds his practice[1] on the sure rules of art, which cannot possibly fail.

Compare this last address of the Assembly and the present state of your affairs with the early engagements of that body, engagements which, not content with declaring, they solemnly deposed upon oath,--swearing lustily, that, if they were supported, they would make their country glorious and happy; and then judge whether those who can write such things, or those who can bear to read them, are of themselves to be brought to any reasonable course of thought or action.|$|E
