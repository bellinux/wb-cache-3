25|$|In 1987 El Detalle, {{one of the}} bus body {{suppliers}} of Mercedes-Benz, started competing with its former chassis provider, investing in low price and modern urban buses, with cheaper Deutz engines. That same year model El Detalle OA-101 was launched. This model was rear-engined and had <b>pneumatic</b> <b>suspension,</b> providing smoother rides and more inside space.|$|E
2500|$|The bus was {{available}} {{with a choice}} of six-cylinder diesel engines, either the Leyland O.400 (later replaced [...] by the Leyland O.401) or the Perkins H6.354. The 5.8 litre H6.354 produced 101bhp; the 6.54 litre O.400 had a peak output of 125bhp whilst the 0.401 (from 1971) produced 138bhp. The usual gearbox was a Turner-Clark synchromesh five-speed model with overdrive top gear. The front and rear axles were sourced from British Leyland's Bathgate factory. Some buses were fitted with a SCG semi-automatic transmission and power steering. The engine was positioned in the centre of the chassis but its relatively high position meant that several steps were needed in the entrance. This was arranged in the overhang ahead of the front wheels allowing one-man operation (as it was known in those days) with the driver taking the fares and issuing tickets as passengers boarded. A small number of LH's, for Lancashire United Transport, Hants & Dorset and the Midland General group were also fitted with a central exit doorway. The radiator was positioned {{at the front of the}} chassis. The suspension was by half-elliptical leaf springs, although BCV had offered <b>pneumatic</b> <b>suspension</b> on heavier buses since 1962.|$|E
50|$|It used a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>suspension</b> {{combined}} with TEMS electronic damping control. The <b>pneumatic</b> <b>suspension</b> automatically raised {{and lowered the}} front and rear of the car separately for maximum stability. TEMS was also used on the Supra and the Soarer (2 stage) and on the highest spec Crown (3 stage).|$|E
5000|$|These {{suspension}} modifications are {{in contrast}} to Lowriders with hydraulic or <b>pneumatic</b> <b>suspensions.</b> Lowriders use another type of suspension tuning in which the height of each individual wheel can be rapidly adjusted by a system of rams which, in some cases, {{makes it possible to}} [...] "bounce" [...] the wheels completely clear of the ground.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a theoretical and experimental research aimed at introducing active control capabilities in the <b>pneumatic</b> secondary <b>suspension</b> of a high speed railway vehicle. The active airspring suspension is used, together with an active lateral suspension, to provide a limited carbody tilt, reducing passengers’ exposure to lateral acceleration in curves and hence allowing to raise service speed on existing high speed lines. To this aim, a suitable control strategy is defined for the active suspension, based on the combination of open-loop and closed-loop control, and the parameters of the actuation and control system are optimised using simplified models of the actively controlled vehicle. The active suspension concept is then demonstrated by means of laboratory tests performed on a full-scale test stand consisting of one bogie with active <b>pneumatic</b> secondary <b>suspension</b> and of a ballast mass reproducing the inertia of half carbody. The numerical and experimental results obtained show the potential of the proposed active suspension to meet the targets set for the investigation...|$|R

40|$|The {{classical}} mathematical {{models and}} the corresponding multibody programs are not always adapted to the increasing diversity of railway bogie designs, since the most general envisaged case consists of a carbody (or several) carried by two rigid bogies equipped with wheelsets. Although the latter configuration still represents the {{major part of the}} railway vehicles in use, new concepts in the design of bogies (independent wheels, articulated frame, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>suspensions,</b> [...] .) have a relatively poor scientific background with respect to the know-how gained in the domain of conventional vehicle : this justifies the development of more general mathematical modelling and computer programs, able to generate a reliable model in a relatively short time. The multibody program ROBOTRAN has been developed in that sense, offering the possibility to obtain the models of a family of railway vehicles - conventional or not - from a symbolic library of carbodies and bogies. The present paper illustates this through a comparison of behaviour between three bogies in a same situation :the entry curving at constant speed...|$|R
