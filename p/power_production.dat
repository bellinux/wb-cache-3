5|$|Conversely, on {{particularly}} windy days, {{even with}} penetration levels of 16%, wind power generation can surpass all other electric power sources in a country. In Spain, {{in the early}} hours of 16 April 2012 wind <b>power</b> <b>production</b> reached the highest percentage of electric <b>power</b> <b>production</b> till then, at 60.46% of the total demand. In Denmark, which had power market penetration of 30% in 2013, over 90hours, wind power generated 100% of the country's power, peaking at 122% of the country's demand at 2am on 28 October.|$|E

5|$|Croatian {{production}} of energy sources covers 85% of nationwide natural gas demand and 19% of oil demand. In 2008, 47.6% of Croatia's primary energy production structure comprised use of natural gas (47.7%), crude oil (18.0%), fuel wood (8.4%), hydro power (25.4%) and other renewable energy sources (0.5%). In 2009, net total electrical <b>power</b> <b>production</b> in Croatia reached 12,725GWh and Croatia imported 28.5% of its electric power energy needs. The bulk of Croatian imports are supplied by the Krško Nuclear Power Plant, 50% owned by Hrvatska elektroprivreda, providing 15% of Croatia's electricity.|$|E
5|$|In particular, the {{proposal}} {{of building the}} biggest offshore wind <b>power</b> <b>production</b> facility {{in the world in}} southwestern Spain in the coast of Cádiz, on the spot of the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar has been met with strong opposition who fear for tourism and fisheries in the area, and because the area is a war grave.|$|E

5|$|Concentrator {{photovoltaics}} (CPV) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for {{the purpose}} of electrical <b>power</b> <b>production.</b> Contrary to conventional photovoltaic systems, it uses lenses and curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto small, but highly efficient, multi-junction solar cells. Solar concentrators of all varieties may be used, and these are often mounted on a solar tracker {{in order to keep the}} focal point upon the cell as the sun moves across the sky. Luminescent solar concentrators (when combined with a PV-solar cell) can also be regarded as a CPV system. Concentrated photovoltaics are useful as they can improve efficiency of PV-solar panels drastically.|$|E
5|$|Grand Coulee Dam is a {{concrete}} gravity dam on the Columbia River in the U.S. state of Washington, built to produce hydroelectric power and provide irrigation water. Constructed between 1933 and 1942, Grand Coulee originally {{had only two}} powerhouses. The third powerhouse, completed in 1974 to increase energy production, makes Grand Coulee the largest power station in the United States by nameplate-capacity at 6,809 MW. However, in terms of yearly <b>power</b> <b>production,</b> Grand Coulee places fifth {{after a number of}} nuclear facilities to the south, like Palo Verde west of Phoenix. This is because river flow varies throughout the year. For example, while the dam may generate at nameplate-capacity in the spring, decreased river flow in the fall means less power can be generated the rest of the year, resulting in a lower capacity factor.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{oil shale}} {{involves}} {{a number of}} environmental impacts, more pronounced in surface mining than in underground mining. These include acid drainage induced by the sudden rapid exposure and subsequent oxidation of formerly buried materials, the introduction of metals including mercury into surface-water and groundwater, increased erosion, sulfur-gas emissions, and air pollution caused by the production of particulates during processing, transport, and support activities. In 2002, about 97% of air pollution, 86% of total waste and 23% of water pollution in Estonia came from the power industry, which uses oil shale as the main resource for its <b>power</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E

On 1 July 1983, SNSK moved its head office from Bergen to Longyearbyen. Svalbard Samfunnsdrift (SSD), a limited company that was responsible for public infrastructure and services, was established by SNSK on 1 January 1989.
