40|$|In {{the present}} review, the main {{objective}} was to report the incidence and causes of herbal medicines induced anticholinergic poisoning in Hong Kong during 1989 – 2012 and to {{emphasize the importance of}} pharmacovigilance, investigations and preventive measures. Relevant papers, official figures and unpublished data were obtained from Medline search, the Department of Health and the Drug and Poisons Information Bureau. In the New Territories East (where ~ 20 % of the Hong Kong population lived), the incidence of herbal medicines induced anticholinergic poisoning during 1989 – 1993 was 0. 09 per 100, 000 population. There were no confirmed cases during 1994 – 1996. In the whole of Hong Kong, the incidence during 2000 –June 2005 was 0. 03 per 100, 000 population. Contamination of Rhizoma Atractylodis (50 %) and erroneous substitution (42 %) were the main causes. The incidence during 2008 – 2012 was 0. 06 per 100, 000 population. Contamination of non-toxic herbs (50 %) and erroneous substitution (41 %) were the main causes. In Hong Kong, contamination of non-toxic herbs by tropane alkaloids and substitution of Flos Campsis by toxic Flos Daturae Metelis were the predominant causes of herbal medicines induced anticholinergic poisoning. Systematic studies along the supply chain are necessary to identify the likely sources of contamination. If erroneous substitution of Flos Campsis by Flos Daturae Metelis could be prevented, 40 % of herbal medicines induced anticholinergic poisoning would not have occurred. Regular inspection of the retailer, continuing education for the staff in the herbal trade and repeated <b>publicity</b> <b>measures</b> will also be required. Pharmacovigilance of herbal medicines should help determine the incidence and causes of adverse reactions and monitor the effectiveness of preventive measures...|$|E

40|$|Organic {{farming is}} {{promoted}} financially in the Federal Republic of Germany since 1989. The entire segment shows a very dynamic development since that time. In the past eleven years, the organically managed land area has {{increased more than}} ten-fold. Now, a large bouquet of measures are offered which target the promotion of organic farming. Among the supports are grants for organically managed land, investment incentives, the promotion of producer co-operatives, the promotion of on-farm processing and direct marketing, <b>publicity</b> <b>measures</b> and measures to raise consumer awareness {{as well as the}} support of training, extension and research in the field of organic farming. In addition, a series of pilot and demonstration projects in the area of processing and marketing of organic products have been carried out. Since large portions of the agricultural structure and the agri-environmental policy fall {{under the jurisdiction of the}} federal states (the â€œBundeslÃ¤nderâ€), the concrete forms of the support measures as, for example the rates of payments for organically managed land, differ significantly from state to state. This is also reflected in the varying reaction of the states to the new orientation in agricultural policy taken by the federal government. It begins to emerge that the emphasis of support policy for organic farming will remain on the payment of area related premiums despite the new accents in national policy. This article identifies and discusses the current form of these support measures as well as possible approaches for further development. With regard to the total spectrum of measures promoting organic farming, a better co-ordination of the existing activities is recommended, for example within the internationally approved framework of an action plan for organic farming. organic farming, agricultural policy, support measures, Agricultural and Food Policy, Environmental Economics and Policy, Farm Management,...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} known for some time that police records {{collected}} by the Department of Transport could be unreliable. Local Authorities use these data as an aid to the decision making process and to assist with objective setting. Studies warning of deficiencies in the accuracy of Stats 19 police data show confusing and often differing levels of inaccuracy. Due to the atypical nature of Road Traffic Accident typology the thesis sets out to examine a methodology for use by professional safety practitioners in order to test the reliability and accuracy of existing data and to test how in an operational environment these data might be expanded {{to meet the needs of}} the practitioner responsible for education, training and <b>publicity</b> <b>measures</b> rather than the pure highway engineering function which exists at the present time. Saunders, in 'Road Safety Management in a shire county' showed how tactical objectives were set by safety practitioners but concluded that operational resource planning was a vital stepping stone between the tactical and operational objective setting phase. The thesis examines this aspect in depth from a theoretical backcloth but illustrates throughout how this is-necessary to improve management efficiency and effectiveness within a public sector organisation. The thesis examines the levels of under-reporting in the local area from a management standpoint and considers the effects this information will have on the organisation. At the same time, aids to accident analysis such as statements made to the police and methods for improving the quality and reliability of data collection in an operational setting are considered. From this, the thesis examines the current and a proposed revision of the resource base and considers how these findings affect the operational resource plan for the organisation. This, and the methodology discussed, is a necessary management consideration if it is to enable an organisation to meet its aims and objectives...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} way in which planning advocates sought to engage the public in democratic reconstruction planning in Britain in the 1940 s. After the bombing of British cities during World War II, planners capitalized on an opportunity to expand the scale of town planning and redefine the role of the planning profession in shaping British society. As planners advocated for increased power for the government to plan, they recognized the need to embrace their role within the political system and legitimize their powers within a democracy. To address these concerns, planners created a forum through which they could inform, educate and consult the public about planning ideas and policies. They developed new techniques to engage and communicate with laypeople, including mobilizing <b>publicity,</b> <b>measuring</b> public opinion, organizing exhibitions, and experimenting with new visual strategies. Overall, the 1940 s is shown to be a period of progress in empowering of citizens to engage in the planning process. However, this empowerment remained partial and temporary, constrained by legal and professional structures that solidified the influence of technical experts. Publicity served as a tool for democratic engagement, but also as a means to promote the expansion of professional and government powers. Once planning legislation had passed, the ideological vigor and idealistic goals behind consultation faded along with their practical necessity. As planning practice shifted from prospective to statutory planning, many of the techniques developed in the 1940 s fell into disuse. The phase of experimentation ended, and the malleable tools for consultation hardened in perfunctory bureaucratic hurdles. Unearthing the roots of participatory planning within the 1940 s complicates the traditional depiction of modernist planners as merely deciding, announcing and defending their work. It shows how the political conditions of war and postwar reconstruction fostered a climate in which planning could thrive, bolstering public support for large scale redevelopment and the impetus for state control. This historical research on planning in the 1940 s adds complexity to the conventional portraits of modernist planners as heroes or villains, showing {{the ways in which they}} balanced the technocratic duties of their work with their commitment to public consultation...|$|R

40|$|Food {{safety is}} an {{important}} public health issue. Product recalls {{are an important part}} of the overall food safety system and occur when potentially unsafe products enter the marketplace. However, it is important that information about the recall ultimately reaches the public. This research assesses the publicity that recalls receive by the popular media. The focus is specifically on recalls of meat and poultry products. <b>Publicity</b> is <b>measured</b> by coverage in the AP Newswire. Data were gathered from the United States Department of Agriculture 2 ̆ 7 s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) and cover meat and poultry recalls from 1982 to 2009. These data were then matched to stories on product recalls from the AP Newswire to arrive at article counts for each recall event. The data compiled indicate that roughly 25 percent of meat and poultry recalls receive at least one story in the Newswire. Count data models were estimated to identify characteristics that make a meat and/or poultry recall event more likely to be publicized. Article counts were expressed as a function of recall characteristics. In particular, this study utilized the zero-inflated negative binomial and zero-inflated Poisson models. Results suggest that the volume of product recalled is a major driver of media coverage. Large recalls are more likely to receive coverage and are covered more intensively than small-volume recalls. In addition, recalls due to the presence of pathogens, especially E. coli O 157 :H 7 and Listeria monocytogenes, receive more publicity than recalls for other reasons. When the problem was discovered by the FSIS, recall events are more frequently covered by the AP Newswire. No significant differences in coverage were observed by the day of the week a recall is announced...|$|R

40|$|Background: Police suicides are an {{important}} problem, and many police forces have high rates. Montreal police suicide rates were slightly higher than other Quebec police rates in the 11 years before the program began (30. 5 / 100, 000 per year vs. 26. 0 / 100, 000). Aims: To evaluate Together for Life, a suicide prevention program for the Montreal police. Methods: All 4, 178 members of the Montreal police participated. The program involved training for all officers, supervisors, and union representatives as well as establishing a volunteer helpline and a <b>publicity</b> campaign. Outcome <b>measures</b> included suicide rates, pre-post assessments of learning, focus groups, interviews, and follow-up of supervisors. Results: In the 12 years since the program began the suicide rate decreased by 79 % (6. 4 / 100, 000), while other Quebec police rates had a nonsignificant (11 %) increase (29. 0 / 100, 000). Also, knowledge increased, supervisors engaged in effective interventions, and the activities were highly appreciated. Limitations: Possibly some unidentified factors unrelated to the program could have influenced the observed changes. Conclusions: The decrease in suicides appears {{to be related to}} this program since suicide rates for comparable populations did not decrease and there were no major changes in functioning, training, or recruitment to explain the differences. Comprehensive suicide prevention programs tailored to the work environment may significantly impact suicide rates...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we model, using the Queuing Theory, the {{situation}} in which the manager of some facilities wishes to maximize the profit generated by the same. The manager tries to attract customers and the effectiveness of his <b>publicity</b> politic is <b>measured</b> in the fraction of customers who renounce. In this paper, unlike the classic models, we consider that the service time of the only server of the facilities behave with uncertainty, which may be represented by means of a fuzzy number. The objective is to determine the rate to be paid by every customer for his service and the level of publicity which the manager must utilize to maximize his profits. The consideration of service times as fuzzy numbers implies that the function to be optimized has fuzzy coefficients, this is why it is necessary to use fuzzy optimization for the solution of the problem and, in addition, a new technique is proposed in order to optimize the functions of fuzzy profit of queuing models. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed proceeding is resolved satisfactorily, and applied as an example, a system of fuzzy queues, which is often found in real situations. The fuzzy queuing systems are more realistic than the crisp systems commonly used in many practical situations. Besides, the extension of the queuing decision models to fuzzy environment allows these models to have further applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to measure the presence of any interaction between the effect of mobile covert speed camera enforcement and the effect of intensive mass media road safety publicity with speedrelated themes. Previous research had shown the individual effect of each of these powerful road safety programs in Victoria, but had not been able to conclusively assess their interaction effect. During 1999, the Victoria Police varied the levels of speed camera activity substantially in four Melbourne police districts according to a systematic plan. Camera hours were increased or reduced by 50 % or 100 % in respective districts for a month at a time, during two separate months when speed-related mass media advertising was present and during two months when it was absent. Other Melbourne police districts remained unchanged. Monthly frequencies of casualty crashes, and their severe injury outcome, in each district during 1996 - 2000 were analysed using Poisson Regression Modelling and Logistic Regression, respectively, to test statistically the effects of the enforcement, publicity and their interaction. In these analyses, the enforcement was represented by five levels of speeding tickets emanating from camera activity during the previous month in the same district, and the <b>publicity</b> by a <b>measure</b> of retained awareness of past and current television advertising intensities. Reductions in crash frequency were associated monotonically with increasing levels of speed camer...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{assess what}} {{interventions}} {{are effective in}} promoting a population shift from using cars towards walking and cycling and to assess {{the health effects of}} such interventions. Data sources Published and unpublished reports in any language identified from electronic databases, bibliographies, websites, and reference lists. Review methods Systematic search and appraisal to identify experimental or observational studies with a prospective or controlled retrospective design that evaluated any intervention applied to an urban population or area by measuring outcomes in members of the local population. Results 22 studies met the inclusion criteria. We found some evidence that targeted behaviour change programmes can change the behaviour of motivated subgroups, resulting (in the largest study) in a shift of around 5 % of all trips at a population level. Single studies of commuter subsidies and a new railway station also showed positive effects. The balance of best available evidence about <b>publicity</b> campaigns, engineering <b>measures,</b> and other interventions suggests that they have not been effective. Participants in trials of active commuting experienced short term improvements in certain measures of health and fitness, but we found no good evidence on effects on health of any effective intervention at population level. Conclusions The best available evidence of effectiveness in promoting a modal shift is for targeted behaviour change programmes, but the social distribution of their effects is unclear and some other types of intervention have yet to be rigorously evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Problem Faith in {{the power}} of {{advertising}} has varied largely through the ages, and since we know that advertising is paid for, it therefore has less weight than the usual news. Publicity through promotional activities is in turn difficult to control. The question which of these two ways to communicate with the market that is the most effective, is equally entitled to ask, as difficult to answer. Purpose/Aim This paper is designed as a pilot study with two different objectives that go hand in hand. The first overall aim is to investigate how advertising and PR / <b>publicity</b> can be <b>measured</b> with the same tools while designing this metric. The second aim is to test whether this metric can find any differences in the advertisements or publicity efficiency. Method The main study that the paper leads to is an experiment that examines how two different groups is affected by the promotional and advertising materials. The two groups have been allocated an identical magazine with a difference between the groups. One group magazine was prepared by a published material as a possible result of a PR activity, such as a loan product or a press release. The second group magazine was prepared with an ad. In order to assure that good reliability achieved in the survey, two preparatory studies were carried out. The entire study leans towards a theoretical framework. Main results The conclusions of the paper are that this approach can seem to find differences between PR and paid advertising. However, the difference is small and focuses on increased probability of purchase after exposure of the ad. PR-material had a weaker effect than the advertisement in this case. The essay will give a basis for further research based on the experimental design used in the study...|$|R
40|$|Through {{a series}} of case studies, this thesis {{examines}} British attitudes to 'terrorism' as practised during various post-war colonial insurgencies. What did British governments and colonial officials understand by this term, as applied to the Jewish insurgents in Palestine {{at the end of}} the Mandate, the Malayan Communists, Mau Mau, and EOKA in Cyprus? The thesis focuses particularly on the way in which propaganda has been seen as a crucial component of the terrorist strategy. Consequently, in the attempt to deny insurgents publicity, and to mediate the perception of politically motivated violence held by various domestic and international audiences, British governments have used a wide variety of propaganda and news-management techniques. The thesis thus assesses the role of government propaganda in counter-insurgency. While some attention is paid to the employment of propaganda within the affected colonies themselves (as part of the 'hearts and minds' strategy), the focus is largely on government attempts to influence wider international audiences and, especially, domestic public opinion in Britain. The need to maintain public support at home for campaigns fought against 'terrorism' in the colonies has been a neglected aspect of most writings on counterinsurgency. However, a detailed examination of the files of the Colonial Office and Foreign Office information departments reveals that in each of the selected case studies, particular attention was paid to keeping domestic opinion 'on side'. Not only have various Whitehall departments and the Central Office of Information produced official publicity material on these insurgencies, but the Foreign Office's anti-communist Information Research Department has disseminated more covert material through the Trade Union movement and other channels. In addition, successive governments have sought to influence the press, newsreel and television coverage of events in the disputed territories. How successful was the effort which went into official publicity work and newsmanagement? Gauging the effectiveness of any propaganda campaign is notoriously difficult. However, by looking at the contemporary press, the output of the major newsreel companies and the files of the BBC, I have attempted to assess how far the mass communications media presented a view of terrorism which accorded with the governmental interpretation. What becomes apparent is that while it may have been fairly easy to ensure that 'terrorists' were duly condemned, and labelled as such - language forming an important part of the battle for legitimacy - government publicists have often struggled due to an absence of policy in Whitehall over the future of the colonies concerned, and on account of the behaviour of the Security Forces. Creating favourable <b>publicity</b> for counter-terrorist <b>measures</b> has been a much harder task than the denigration of terrorism itself...|$|R
