5|$|A {{number of}} species of shrimp and fish take refuge among the {{branches}} of Millepora alcicornis, seemingly immune to the venom. Hawkfish in particular often perch {{on top of the}} fire coral, <b>perhaps</b> protected by their skinless pectoral fins. <b>Perhaps</b> unsurprisingly, Millepora alcicornis has few predators. The fireworm (Hermodice carunculata) sometimes grazes on it, but prefers other corals. Certain nudibranchs in the genus Phyllidia eat it as do filefish in the family Monacanthidae.|$|E

5|$|During {{recorded}} history, eruptions have consisted {{primarily of}} a central vent eruption (in the caldera) followed by an explosive eruption, then lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene eruption was about 6660BC, and further eruptions occurred in 1245BC±150years (dated through radiocarbon dating), about 850BC, 200BC±100 years, 350AD±300 years, 675AD±50 years, in 1350, 1541 (<b>perhaps),</b> 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (<b>perhaps),</b> 1829, 1831, 1833 (<b>perhaps),</b> 1845, 1916, December 1984 – March 1985, September 1985 – July 1991, and possibly in April 1994. Many of these eruptions involved a central vent eruption, a flank vent eruption, and a phreatic (steam) explosion. Ruiz is the second-most active volcano in Colombia after Galeras.|$|E
5|$|Edward, {{or rather}} {{those who were}} {{wielding}} power on his behalf, also appointed {{a number of new}} ealdormen to positions in Wessex. Little is known of two of these men, {{and it is difficult to}} determine which faction, if any, they belonged to. Edwin, probably ruling in Sussex, and <b>perhaps</b> also parts of Kent and Surrey, was buried at Abingdon, an abbey patronised by Ælfhere. Æthelmær, who oversaw Hampshire, held lands in Rutland, <b>perhaps</b> suggesting links to Æthelwine.|$|E
5|$|Glastonbury {{fell into}} Saxon hands after the Battle of Peonnum in 658. Saxons under Cenwalh of Wessex conquered Somerset as far west as the River Parrett, <b>perhaps</b> with the {{intention}} of gaining control of the abbey. Cenwalh allowed the British abbot, Bregored, to remain in power, a move <b>perhaps</b> intended as a show of good faith to the defeated Britons. After Bregored's death in 669, he was replaced by an Anglo-Saxon, Berhtwald, but British monks remained for many years.|$|E
5|$|Karamokho Alfa's {{maternal}} {{cousin was}} Maka Jiba, {{the ruler of}} Bundu, and both men studied in Fugumba under the famous scholar Tierno Samba. However, there are no records of Bundu participation in the Futa Jallon jihad, <b>perhaps</b> because of the internal troubles in Bundu at that time, or <b>perhaps</b> because Maka Jiba was not greatly interested in the cause.|$|E

5|$|Some unusual {{features}} of the Chinese vampire include its long, curved fingernails, <b>perhaps</b> derived from the appearance of growing fingernails on corpses due to flesh recession, and its greenish-white furry skin, <b>perhaps</b> derived from fungus or mould growing on corpses. Jiangshi legends have inspired a genre of jiangshi films and literature in Hong Kong and East Asia. Films like Encounters of the Spooky Kind and Mr. Vampire were released during the jiangshi cinematic boom of the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Structure 4 is the North Structure. It {{dates to}} the Late Classic but overlies {{construction}} dating to the Middle Preclassic. A stairway ascended {{the front of the}} building, under which were found the remains of Late Classic polychrome ceramics, <b>perhaps</b> belonging to a pre-construction ritual offering. The stucco floors on top of the mound supported asymmetric walls that <b>perhaps</b> date to the Postclassic Period, being associated with a mix of Late Classic and Postclassic pottery.|$|E

5|$|The use of {{incendiary}} devices had {{decreased by}} the 14th century, <b>perhaps</b> {{due to the}} economic realities of war where it became increasingly important that captured castles and towns were undamaged.

5|$|According to {{historian}} John V. A. Fine, Shishman {{may have}} established his {{authority over the}} Vidin region {{as early as the}} 1270s, after the death of the previous lord of that area, Jacob Svetoslav. He was <b>perhaps</b> elevated to the position of despot of Vidin soon after the accession of another Bulgarian noble of Cuman origin, George Terter I (r. 1280–1292), to the Bulgarian throne in 1280. Shishman was likely a close relative, <b>perhaps</b> even a brother, of George Terter I.|$|E

It was probably in this time too that Nicholas became a clerk at Arbroath Abbey and <b>perhaps</b> a canon of Dunblane Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Many coins {{have been}} found in {{northern}} Ethiopia and Eritrea, the central region of Aksum, though Aksumite coins are reported to {{have been found}} in Arato and Lalibela. Many coins have been also found further afield. Numerous hoards of coins (always gold save one silver coin) {{have been found in}} Southern Arabia, much more than in Aksum itself, attesting <b>perhaps</b> to an Aksumite presence in parts of the region (<b>perhaps</b> supporting the use of titles claiming control over parts of South Arabia from GDRT's time). The hoards may be the remnants of hoards left in Kaleb's time (<b>perhaps</b> used to pay soldiers), when it was under an Aksumite governor. Outside of the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula, coins have been found as far as Israel, Meroe, Egypt, and India. Silver and copper coins are mainly found in Aksum, though some can be traced to Palestinian pilgrim centers.|$|E

5|$|Nevado del Ruiz has {{undergone}} three distinct eruptive periods, the first beginning 1.8million years ago. During the present period (beginning 11,000years ago), it has erupted at least twelve times, producing ashfalls, pyroclastic flows, and lahars. The historically recorded eruptions have primarily involved a central vent eruption (in the caldera) {{followed by an}} explosive eruption, then the formation of lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene eruption was in about 6660BC, and further eruptions occurred around 1245, 850, 200BC and in about 350, 675, in 1350, 1541 (<b>perhaps),</b> 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (<b>perhaps),</b> 1829, 1831, 1833 (<b>perhaps),</b> 1845, 1916, December 1984 through March 1985, 1987 through July 1991, and possibly in April 1994.
