In 1998, the NATO-Russia <b>Permanent</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Council</b> was established. On 8July 1997, three former communist countries, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland, were invited to join NATO, which each did in 1999. Membership went on expanding with the accession of seven more Central and Eastern European countries to NATO: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania. They were first invited to start talks of membership during the 2002 Prague summit, and joined NATO on 29March 2004, shortly before the 2004 Istanbul summit. At that time, the decision was criticised in the US by many military, political and academic leaders as a [...] "a policy error of historic proportions." [...] According to George F.

40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{political changes}} in Europe {{during the late}} 1980 s and the early 1990 s which {{marked the end of}} the Cold War and the bipolarity between two political systems did not simultaneously put an end to instabilities, crises, and conflicts. New threats to security arose quickly and unpredictably as the war in Bosnia and the conflict in Kosovo demonstrated. Within this geopolitical landscape NATO managed to change the priority of its tasks - redefining its military raison d'etre and emphasizing its political role. This study analyzes NATO's development during the post-Cold War era and its future strategic rationale, focusing on three cornerstones for European peace and stability: NATO's "open door" enlargement policy, the NATO-Russian cooperation in the <b>Permanent</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Council,</b> and NATO's new Strategic Concept.

On 28 May 2002, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Russian Federation adopted a Declaration in Rome on "NATO-Russian Relations: A New Quality. " The Declaration replaced the <b>Permanent</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Council</b> (PJC) with the NATO-Russia Council (NRC) {{as the new}} venue for consultation, cooperation, joint decision and joint action. This thesis analyzes the origins and prospects of the NRC. It provides background on Moscow's relations with NATO from 1990 to 1997. It analyzes the PJC, which was established by the May 1997 Founding Act, notably {{with regard to the}} key events in the PJC's history and its merits and shortcomings. Although the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks against the United States led to a new era in NATO-Russia relations, each side has pursued this new relationship because of its own motives. The thesis analyzes the Rome Declaration and discusses the key differences between the NATO-Russia Council and its predecessor, the PJC. It also assesses the NRC's progress to date and its visible and potential problems. The thesis concludes that the prospects for the NATO-Russia Council depend in large part on the political will of the participating governments. Major, United States Marine Corp...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{development}} of positive institutional arrangements such as Russian participation in the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia and the NATO-Russia <b>Permanent</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Council,</b> the strategic culture of Russia has not changed in any fundamental sense. Russian strategic culture has not evolved {{in ways that would}} make Russian policies compatible with those of NATO countries in the necessary economic, social, technological, and military spheres. On the domestic side, Russia has yet to establish a stable democracy and the necessary legal, judicial, and regulatory institutions for a free-market economy. Russia evidently lacks the necessary cultural traditions, including concepts of accountability and transparency, to make these adaptations in the short-term. Owing in part to its institutional shortcomings, severe socioeconomic setbacks have afflicted Russia. Russian conventional military strength has been weakened, and a concomitant reliance by the Russians on nuclear weapons as their ultimate line of defense has increased. The breakdown in the infrastructure that supports Russian early warning and surveillance systems and nuclear weapons stewardship defense, coupled with a tendency towards has exacerbated Russian anxiety and distrust toward NATO. Russia's reliance on nuclear weapons as the ultimate line of defense, coupled with a tendency toward suspicion and distrust toward NATO, could lead to dangerous strategic miscalculation and nuclear catastrophe.
