25|$|British Conservative Party Member of Parliament Charlie Elphicke {{published}} research on October 30, 2012, {{which showed that}} some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard corporation tax. He followed this research by calling on the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to force these multinationals, which also included Google and The Coca-Cola Company, to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> of UK tax.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} that the Declaration of Independence was adopted in July 1776, the Thirteen Colonies and Great Britain had been at war for more than a year. Relations had been deteriorating between the colonies and the mother country since 1763. [...] Parliament enacted a series of {{measures}} to increase revenue from the colonies, such as the Stamp Act of 1765 and the Townshend Acts of 1767.

2500|$|Some delegates were {{reluctant}} to expand into any so [...] "remote wilderness". It would retard the commercial development of the east. They would be easily influenced, [...] "foreign gold" [...] would corrupt them. Western peoples were the least desirable Americans, only good for perpetual provinces. There were so many foreigners moving out west, {{there was no telling}} how things would turn out. These were poor people, they could not <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> of taxes. It would be [...] "suicide" [...] for the original states. New states could become a majority in the Senate, they would abuse their power, [...] "enslaving" [...] the original thirteen. If they also loved liberty, and could not tolerate eastern state dominance, they would be justified in civil war. Western trade interests could drag the country into an inevitable war with Spain for the Mississippi River. As time wore on, any war for the Mississippi River was obviated by the 1803 Louisiana Purchase and the 1812 American victory at New Orleans.|$|E
5000|$|Research on {{tax evasion}} shows that tax {{cheaters}} may face psychic costs from their deception, [...] {{because they feel}} guilty about not <b>paying</b> <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> for the services that they use. These psychic costs may also be from fear of shame if they are prosecuted for tax evasion and damage to their reputation; with these psychic costs, taxpayers may even pass up fairly low-risk opportunities to hide income from the taxman.|$|R

50|$|Governor Murphy's {{address was}} {{thorough}} and straight forward.

On the issue of taxation, Murphy felt large corporations were not <b>paying</b> <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> <b>share.</b> Toward this end {{he argued that the}} owners of small properties paid taxes based upon the full value of their properties but large businesses had the means to disguise the true value of their holdings and thus reduce their tax burden.|$|R

About 80% thought that the government should do more to curb illegal immigration.|$|R
50|$|Identifying {{new sources}} of revenue and helping to close the City’s budget gap are among Treasurer Cisneros’ top priorities. He has re-focused staff to provide the city with more tax collectors, {{increased}} the collection of delinquent taxes, and closed loopholes to ensure that everyone <b>pays</b> <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> <b>share.</b> In his first full fiscal year (2004-2005), these and other initiatives resulted in over $40 million more collected over the previous fiscal year, far exceeded targeted projections. With the additional funding, the legislative and executive branches of San Francisco were able to restore funding for healthcare, public safety and other important programs.|$|R

50|$|In {{the real}} world, where people cannot {{negotiate}} costlessly, {{there may be}} collective action problems of those who caused a nuisance, for instance by smoke emissions from a factory to many neighbouring farms, and so getting together to negotiate effectively can be difficult against a single polluter because of coordination problems. If it is efficient for the farmers to pay the factory to reduce its emissions, some of those farmers may hold off <b>paying</b> <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> <b>share,</b> {{hoping to get a}} free ride.

[...] In June 2012, McKinnell publicly criticised Take That singer Gary Barlow following newspaper allegations of tax avoidance made against him. McKinnell agreed that Barlow should consider returning his recently awarded OBE if allegations of tax avoidance were proven [...] "because it doesn't send out the right messages to ordinary people who are <b>paying</b> <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> of tax".|$|R

Another example, legislation authorizing local governments to levy regulatory fees on water polluting businesses requiring businesses that pollute the water to <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> to clean polluted water resulting from their business activities.

5000|$|The {{truth is}} that the wealthy have {{received}} more from America than most Americans—not just wealth but the infrastructure that has allowed them to amass their wealth: banks, the Federal Reserve, the stock market, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the legal system, federally sponsored research, patents, tax supports, the military protection of foreign investments, and much much more.

The Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) programs to ensure compliance and to collect delinquent taxes are viewed by many as critical for maintaining the public's confidence in our tax system. Congress asked GAO to present information on trends in IRS's compliance and collection programs and to discuss issues related to IRS's efforts to increase staffing for these programs.

40|$|Cheaters disrupt {{cooperation}} by {{reaping the}} benefits without <b>paying</b> <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> of associated costs. Cheater impact can be diminished if cooperators display a tag ('greenbeard') and recognise and preferentially direct cooperation towards other tag carriers. Despite its popular appeal, {{the feasibility of}} such greenbeards has been questioned because the complex patterns of partner-specific cooperative behaviours seen in nature require greenbeards to come in different colours. Here we show that a locus ('Tgr') of a social amoeba represents a polychromatic greenbeard. Patterns of natural Tgr locus sequence polymorphisms predict partner-specific patterns of cooperation by underlying variation in partner-specific protein-protein binding strength and recognition specificity. Finally, Tgr locus polymorphisms increase fitness because they help avoid potential costs of cooperating with incompatible partners. These results suggest that a polychromatic greenbeard can provide a key mechanism for the evolutionary maintenance of cooperation...|$|R
5000|$|Before Trump {{declared}} his candidacy {{for president in}} 2015, he regularly shamed and criticized others for not <b>paying</b> <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> of taxes. However, in the September 2016 presidential debate, Trump said that using loopholes to avoid paying income taxes in the 1970s [...] "makes me smart." [...] In October 2016, the New York Times reported that Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns, a tax deduction so substantial it could have allowed him to legally avoid paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years. The Trump campaign did not challenge {{the accuracy of the}} tax returns or correct the claim that Trump might not have paid income taxes for 18 years. Trump also chastised Mitt Romney in 2012 for delaying on releasing his tax returns. Trump has, however, not released his tax returns.|$|R

The sensational {{manner in which the}} gang blasted their way out led to an intense manhunt that netted some of the culprits but not the leaders who had fled. In a sign of the Great Depression, the city controller's office revealed that the two patrolmen had been working without pay due to a shortage in the police fund.
