5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on 8May several satellite experts questioned the analysis of satellite <b>pings</b> made by Inmarsat staff because the Doppler frequency shifts measured were apparently not properly corrected against the satellite's own drift (a periodic North-South oscillation of 3° every 24hours). Without any additional data being released, the implication of this new analysis was that the northern portion of the Inmarsat satellite <b>pings</b> arc could not be ruled out. The Malaysian government released the satellite data three weeks later.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March, Inmarsat {{provided}} basic {{flight data}} relating to Flight 370 to SITA, which relayed information to Malaysia Airlines and investigators. On 9–10 March, Inmarsat engineers {{noted that the}} ground station log recorded <b>pings</b> from the aircraft for several hours after contact was lost with air traffic control. Malaysian investigators set up an international working group, consisting of various agencies with experience in aircraft performance and satellite communications, to further analyse the signals between Flight 370 and the ground station, especially the signal at 08:19. These included representatives from the UK's Inmarsat, AAIB, and Rolls-Royce; China's Civil Aviation Administration and Aircraft Accident Investigation Department; the US NTSB and FAA; and Malaysian authorities.|$|E
50|$|In online {{multiplayer}} video games, <b>ping</b> {{refers to}} the network latency between a player's client and the game server. Ping is reported quantitatively as an average time in milliseconds (ms). The lower one's <b>ping</b> is, the lower the latency is and the less lag the player will experience. High <b>ping</b> and low <b>ping</b> are commonly used terms in online gaming, where high <b>ping</b> refers to a <b>ping</b> that causes a severe amount of lag; while any level of <b>ping</b> may cause lag, severe lag is usually caused with a <b>ping</b> of over 100 milliseconds. In games where timing is key, such as first-person shooter and real-time strategy games, a low <b>ping</b> is always desirable, as a low <b>ping</b> means smoother gameplay by allowing faster updates of game data between the players' clients and game server.|$|R

25|$|A {{search of}} records related to Bonie's cell phone found {{a series of}} <b>pings</b> that night, {{as well as some}} calls from towers in Orange and Rockland counties, {{northwest}} of the city {{on the other side of}} the Hudson River. Bonie has relatives living there. One detective, Malcolm Reiman, worked with a ballistics expert to narrow a search area based on Bonie's known departure and arrival times at his house and an estimated rate of road travel speed. Within that area, they searched road embankments, primarily in Harriman State Park, a large wooded protected area that straddles the border between the two counties, but did not find Moore's body.|$|E
25|$|A {{few minutes}} after Chávez's {{broadcast}} at 3:45 pm, gunfire erupted again and the march began to disperse slightly. As the demonstrators marched closer to the Llaguno Overpass, they could see Chavistas heavily armed, some with pistols. Police began to disperse the Chavista gunmen returning fire and few demonstrators began to follow behind them with <b>pings</b> of gunfire heard on the police armored vehicles, though the marchers fled shortly after as the violence grew. Only when Chávez emerged from the broadcast did he learn {{the extent of the}} violence. According to medical staff at the Vargas Hospital, the first to arrive at the hospital were opposition marchers. According to surgeons, the marchers {{had been shot in the}} back with handgun fire while fleeing and others were severely injured from 7.62×51mm NATO military rounds from Fal rifles, standard equipment of the National Guard defending Chávez. Later after police responded to pro-Chávez shooting, Chávez supporters then began being seen injured in the hospitals. As a result of the confrontations, between 17 and 19 were left dead and around 60 injured, most killed between 3:20 pm and 3:55 pm.|$|E

IGN's Matt Risley rated the episode 9 out of 10 and concluded, [...] "Sweet, touching, intelligent, different, utterly imaginative and accessible by both hardcore fans and newbies alike— this is not only Doctor Who, but sci-fi telly at its finest". He also praised Gaiman's script for being [...] "a simple idea executed brilliantly".

In the first two weeks of April, aircraft and ships deployed equipment to listen for signals from the underwater locator beacons attached to the aircraft's [...] "black boxes". Four unconfirmed signals were detected between 6 and 8 April near the time the beacons' batteries were likely to have been exhausted.

2500|$|The aircraft's flight {{recorders}} were fitted with Dukane DK100 underwater acoustic beacons—also known as [...] "underwater locator beacons" [...] (ULBs) or [...] "pingers"—which are activated by immersion in salt water and thereafter emit a 10millisecond pulse every second at frequency of 37.5±1kHz. The beacons {{are limited by}} battery life, providing a minimum of 30 days and have an estimated maximum life of 40 days, according to their manufacturer. The nominal distance at which these beacons can be detected is 2,000–3,000metres. Because the {{flight recorders}} {{to which they are}} attached could provide valuable information in the investigation, an intense effort was made to detect the beacons' <b>pings</b> before their batteries expired.|$|E
