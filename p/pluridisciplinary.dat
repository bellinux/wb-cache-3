40|$|The {{application}} of technological development to {{the agricultural sector}} re-quires considerable structural change: increases {{in the size of}} farms, sub-stitutions of capital for labour and a consequent outflow of labour. Such changes ought to be brought about by the market mechanism, but in most western countries are impeded by the price policies of Governments. This political opposition originates in the well-integrated farmers organisations which press for a strong emphasis on price policy at the expense of structural or social policies. In this article a systems approach is used to explain this opposition {{in the context of the}} actions within and the interactions between the various social systems in which agriculture participates as a subsystem. A tentative descrip-tive model of this interaction pattern is developed to indicate the interfaces of the different social subsystems, and a <b>pluridisciplinary</b> approach is advocated to incorporate psychological, sociological and politicological material into the economic analysis. In a certain sense it is an institutional approach by means of <b>pluridisciplinary</b> research. The last two sections of the article deal with the possibilities and difficul-ties of such an approach and <b>pluridisciplinary</b> research based on open decision models is advocated.

40|$|Landscape: {{stake and}} tool for land use planning. For last decades, {{landscape}} has gradually become a stake {{of land use}} planning in Europe. The European Landscape Convention formalizes landscape as an issue of general interest and promotes a democratic landscape planning. However, landscape is rarely in practice the subject of <b>pluridisciplinary</b> and concerted approaches. So land use planning searches for a landscape concept able to gather together the various disciplinary and societal points of view. This federative concept can help it to build concerted policies of landscape planning. To question about and clarify nature, scale and ways of reading of landscape then enable us to develop a landscape concept that holds two positions in land use planning. Firstly, landscape as we define it constitutes a stake of land use planning in line with its <b>pluridisciplinary</b> and concerted approach. Secondly, as tool of questioning and consciousness-raising about land use planning, landscape contributes to elaborate a concerted land management...|$|E
40|$|There are {{numerous}} kinds of definitions and discourses of conceptualization for the collaboration among disciplines. Examining {{a wide range}} of the related texts represents various, divergent and also contradictory discourses back to this up. Carefully and critically examining the common perception of collaboration among disciplines, in this paper, authors introduce an alternative so-called <b>pluridisciplinary.</b> rn rnAnd, it is argued that pluri-disciplinary could be considered as an umbrella term for all other modes of collaboration among disciplines including multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdiciplinary. It is also contended that unlike the conventional perception of collaborations between disciplines, epistemological and instrument rationales need {{to be seen as a}} continuous integration, so such a holistic approach will lead to a new so-called discipline; transdiciplinary. It is also articulated that there is a hierarchical relationship between disciplines in the alternative. In this paper, simple knowledge in <b>pluridisciplinary</b> studies will be replaced by super-complex knowledge, so called; trans-disciplinary, as a new-fashioned discipline, emerges. ...|$|E

40|$|Educational {{phenomena}} and child development fascinate many disciplines {{for which they}} offer a tremendous field of experimentation and application. More {{than a hundred years}} ago, when educational sciences adopted the main institutional emblems of an academic discipline (chairs, diploma, laboratories, scientific network etc.), they obviously vacillated between the dream of becoming a unified science (as pedology testifies), and the claim of a rewarding pluridisciplinarity that could synergise all disciplines concerned with the child and with education. This paper asserts that the issue of pluridisciplinarity is constitutive for the development of sciences of education whose object is ever coveted by other disciplines. The first section adopts {{the point of view of}} a social history and, on the basis of voluminous archives, it describes the main lines of the shaping of this <b>pluridisciplinary</b> field in Geneva, representative of that which also occurs elsewhere.
