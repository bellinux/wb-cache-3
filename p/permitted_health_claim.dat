However {{there is no clear}} understanding of how consumers use <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> and their likely impact on consumer food behaviour or health. More research is needed, but a review of previous studies allows some common conclusions can be drawn. <b>Health</b> <b>claims</b> on foods are seen by consumers as useful, and when a product features a <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> they view it as healthier and state {{they are more likely to}} purchase it. Consumers are sceptical of <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> from food companies and strongly agree that they should be approved by government. Consumers do not make clear distinctions between nutrition content claims, structure-function <b>claims</b> and <b>health</b> <b>claims.</b> Consumers generally don’t like long and complex, scientifically worded claims on foods; they prefer split claims – with a short succinct statement of the claim on the front of pack and more detail provided elsewhere. At present about 8 % of Australian products carry a <b>health</b> or related <b>claim,</b> a level not much less than in the US, where more high-level claims are permitted. It may be that manufacturers will continue to prefer to use nutrient content or structure function claims in Australia and New Zealand, which will be easier to substantiate and more consumer-friendly than high-level disease-related <b>health</b> <b>claims...</b>|$|R

Results Awareness of the role of folate in the prevention of birth defects rose by 8 % in the first 6 months of the campaign (without <b>health</b> <b>claims)</b> and by 15 % in the second half (when <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> were incorporated). Awareness of the recommendation to take folate before pregnancy rose from 21 % at baseline to 29 % in November 1998 and 44 % in May 1999.

40|$|By the Croatian {{accession}} to the European Union, a legal framework {{related to the}} use of nutrition and <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> on foods was adopted, as well as rules on informing consumers about food. Since milk and dairy products are traditionally positioned as healthy and nutritionally valuable products, adjusting to the new legislation is challenging for the dairy industry. After the evaluation process of <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> for nutrients naturally present in milk and dairy products, as well as those added in the production process, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) confirmed the beneficial effect of many active substances and established their recommended doses and effects. By the adoption of Commission Regulation (EU) No 432 / 2012 of 16 May 2012 a list of <b>permitted</b> <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> made on foods other than those referring to the reduction of disease risk and to children’s development and health was established.

40|$|Given the {{credence}} {{nature of}} functional food attributes labelling {{plays a key}} role in allowing consumers to make informed choices about foods with enhanced health attributes. The degree to which a particular jurisdiction <b>permits</b> <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> for food products and the type of allowable <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> influence the information set available to consumers. In Canada the regulatory environment governing <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> for functional food products is somewhat more restrictive than in other jurisdictions, including the United States. Food manufacturers therefore also use visual imagery to suggest a health benefit, such as the picture of a red heart to imply that a product has heart health benefits. The paper characterizes these labelling strategies as “partial labelling”, while “full labelling’’ refers to formal <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> on food labels, ranging from general (structure-function) claims, to risk reduction claims, to disease prevention claims. This paper explores the effect of labelling (full and partial) on consumers’ functional food choices. How might different types of labelling information and the verification of <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> by different agencies affect consumers’ preferences for functional foods? Using data from an online survey of 740 Canadians conducted in summer 2009 the paper uses discrete choice modelling to examine the responses of Canadian consumers to different product labelling strategies for milk enhanced with Omega- 3. Conditional Logit and Latent Class models are estimated. Preliminary results suggest that full labelling is preferred over partial labelling, but primarily for risk reduction claims. There is no significant difference between a function claim, such as “good for your heart” and partial labelling in the form of a red heart symbol. The choice experiment included verification of <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> by a government agency (Health Canada) or by a third party (Heart and Stroke Foundation). The preliminary results suggest that consumers on average respond positively to verification of <b>health</b> <b>claims,</b> however, the latent class model reveals considerable heterogeneity in consumer attitudes toward the source of verification. Interactions between key-socio-demographic and attitudinal variables and the main effects variables in the choice experiment provide further insights into consumer responses.

40|$|Food {{manufacturers}} are increasingly placing <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> on their products like “important for eyesight” or “calcium {{is good for}} bones”. In order to protect consumers from erroneous claims and misleading information and to prevent unfair competition, uniform provisions have been introduced within the EU for <b>health</b> <b>claims.</b> The legal foundation is Regulation (EC) No. 1924 / 2006 on nutrition and <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> made on food. According to this Regulation, food manufacturers may only use <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> in future when they are contained in an EU positive list.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to survey the {{labelling}} of drinks with pronounced health benefits found on the Swedish market today and to evaluate whether they are in accordance to EU and national regulations or not.

The process of approaching full functioning regulations in the EU on nutrition and <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> is proceeding slowly. A snapshot of today�’s market of drinks with pronounced health effects shows that there are multiple cases of misleading statements and interfering labelling on the products. Often it concerns nutritional labelling or <b>health</b> <b>claims.</b> In this study a total of 60 <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> were found on the products. The <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> were made on 10 different vitamins, seven different minerals, five other substances, dietary fibre (one claim) and lactic acid bacteria (three <b>claims).</b> One <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> had reached a final decision from the European Commission and is no longer allowed. For 44 <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> found in this study similar claims were found in EFSA�’s (European Food Safety Authority) Register of questions database and the evaluations of these were used to estimate the outcome for those claims found in the study. The estimation reveals that 38 <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> might be approved though 13 of these might be considered to be misleading since the EU population does not have an inadequate intake of the subject of the claim. Six of the <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> might not be permitted to use.

The biggest threat is seen in false investment conditioned by the limited research and development budgets, especially of small and medium-sized enterprises, and the cost intensive scientific evaluation to reach an authorized <b>health</b> <b>claim.</b> Conclusions: Overall, there are several strengths and opportunities speaking for SMEs and <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> in the near future. The most promising ones are the publishing of the new European Union Register of Nutrition and <b>Health</b> <b>Claims</b> and the learning effects that will occur. The biggest threat is, and will remain to be, false investment and the possible loss of a lot of money. Nevertheless, <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> for small and medium-sized enterprises will inevitably be the future to keep the European food and drink market competitive...|$|R
40|$|<b>Health</b> <b>claims</b> that {{characterize}} {{the relationship between a}} sub-stance (e. g., a food or food component) and a disease (e. g., cancer or cardiovascular disease) or health-related condition (e. g., hyper-tension) require premarket approval by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be included on the labels of conven-tional foods and dietary supplements. Before 1990, <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> about disease were not allowed on food labels. However, in the late 1980 s, emerging evidence about relationships between diet and health generated interest among consumers and the food industry about conveying this information on the food label. <b>Health</b> <b>claims</b> were first authorized by FDA after the enactment of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (1). Initially, the only <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> that were allowed were authorized <b>health</b> <b>claims,</b> i. e., those that met FDA’s standard of “significant scien-tific agreement. ” FDA’s determination of significant scientifi...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> on {{purchase}} intent, emotional response and liking {{has never been}} previously reported. In this study prebiotic enriched bread {{was used as a}} model functional food. Purchase intent, emotional response and liking were investigated in 3 phases: 1 : focus groups were used to gauge consumer perception of <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> and functional foods. 2 : the impact of <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> on purchase intent and emotional responses were measured using an online survey (n = 122) and 3 : hedonic ratings on bread rolls presented with or without any associated claims were obtained (n = 100). A cluster analysis of the purchase intent data identified two clusters of consumers who were either receptive or non-receptive to <b>health</b> <b>claims.</b> Receptive and non-receptive consumers significantly differed in the emotions they reported with respect to the claims. The hedonic ratings did not significantly differ between the breads tasted with or without <b>health</b> <b>claims...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background The Nutrition and <b>Health</b> <b>Claim</b> Regulation 1924 / 2006 /EC, {{together}} with EFSA guidances on the scientific requirements for {{different type of}} <b>health</b> <b>claims,</b> is setting the basis for <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> substantiation in the EU. Aim The aim of this presentation is {{to bring up the}} key challenges that the food industry and clinical research organizations are facing when meeting these requirements. Results and discussion Key issues in clinical research planning to meet the requirements set for the <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> substantiation are: (1) Selection of right outcome markers since the selection of outcome marker defines actually the formulation of the <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> to be used on food or food ingredient. (2) Selection of right target population since that determines the target consumer group for the food with a <b>health</b> <b>claim.</b> (3) Selection of dose regime and food matrices used since these largely determine the conditions set {{for the use of the}} <b>health</b> <b>claim.</b> One of the major challenges in <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> substantiation is the deviant approach to risk factors or biomarkers. From the regulation point of view, a single risk factor approach is emphasized, but from the clinical and scientific point of view the pattern of different risk markers or biomarkers could, in some cases, be a more relevant choice to reflect the final health outcome. This is especially the case in the nutrition and health area because we are often dealing with weak but multiple health effects of certain food items or ingredients. Also the lack of validated well-established biomarkers potent to be affected by diet is a challenge in <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> substantiation. The selection of right target population is often a compromise between choosing a more potential target group to obtain efficacy (i. e. risk factors elevated vs. patient groups) and choosing a rationale to generalize the results to wider population (target consumer) group. The selection of optimal dosing regime and matrices for a clinical study is partly dependent on previous scientific data on the dose response, if existing. But equally important is the choice of feasible doses from product formulation and food consumption point of view. Conclusion With careful analysis of the existing data, advance planning and clinical research strategy it is possible to build up a <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> substantiation that meets the requirements both of Nutrition and <b>Health</b> <b>Claim</b> Regulation and EFSA...|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of studies examining {{the effect of}} nutrition information on food packets (such as the nutrition information panel (NIP), front-of-pack labels (FoPLs) and <b>health</b> <b>claims)</b> have examined each in isolation, even though they often occur together. This study investigated the relationship between FoPLs and <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> since (i) they both appear {{on the front of}} packs and typically receive more attention from consumers than the NIP, (ii) they can convey contradictory messages (i. e., <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> provide information on nutrients that are beneficial to health while FoPLs provide information on nutrients associated with increased health risks) and (iii) there is currently scant research on how consumers trade off between these two sources of information. Ten focus groups (n = 85) explored adults 2 ̆ 7 and children 2 ̆ 7 s reactions when presented with both a FoPL (the Daily Intake Guide, Multiple Traffic Lights, or the Health Star Rating) and a <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> (nutrient content, general-level-, or high-level). A particular focus was participants 2 ̆ 7 processing of discrepant information. Participants reported that <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> {{were more likely to be}} considered during product evaluations if they were perceived to be trustworthy, relevant and informative. Trust and ease of interpretation were most important for FoPLs, which were more likely than <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> to meet criteria and be considered during product evaluation (especially the Health Star Rating and Multiple Traffic Lights). Results indicate that consumers generally find FoPLs more useful than <b>health</b> <b>claims...</b>|$|R
