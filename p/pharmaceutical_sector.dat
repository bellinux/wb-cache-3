2500|$|Overall, about 5.5-6% of the European patents {{granted by}} the European Patent Office are opposed.

The same figures were cited in 2013. The opposition rate (i.e. the number of oppositions filed per 100 granted patents) before the EPO is consistently higher in the closest available proxy for the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>sector</b> than it is in organic chemistry and in all sectors (overall EPO average).

40|$|Convergence {{processes}} {{are based on}} the activity of distinct industry sectors showing crossindustry collaborations. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze cross-industry collaborations between the food and <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>sectors</b> in the convergence area of functional foods. Selected companies from food (Nestlé/Danone) and <b>pharmaceutical</b> (Martek/Bayer HealthCare) <b>sectors</b> are analyzed using the determinants of motivation and industrial scope. The analysis shows that food companies are more active in cross-industry collaborations than pharmaceutical companies. The latter are more active at the front-end of the value chain focusing on research and development, and delivering their ingredients to food companies that due to their higher expertise in consumer marketing launch the products. While the first cross-industry collaborations were based on an exploration motivation, those that follow focus on exploitation. Acquisitions and licensing agreements are dominant in inside-out and outside-in processes, whereas strategic alliances and joint ventures are based on a coupled process between the food and <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>sectors...</b>|$|R
