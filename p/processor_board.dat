He promoted {{the purchase of a}} VAX-11/780 for 'real-time' signal processing research and created the Peripheral Signal <b>Processor</b> <b>board</b> (PSP).

25|$|In 1988, NEC {{released}} a kit called PS98-145-HMW for Unix enthusiasts. The kit contained a V60 <b>processor</b> <b>board</b> {{that could be}} plugged into select models of the PC-9800 computer series and a 15-floppy disk distribution of their PC-UX/V release 2.0. The suggested retail price for this kit was 450,000 Yen. NEC themselves included a V60 processor in their 1991 Bungo mini 5SX, 7SX, and 7SD word processor computers, where the V60 was used as fast outline font processor, while the main system processor was a 16MHz NEC V33.|$|E
2500|$|The Slot-A Athlons {{were the}} first multiplier-locked CPUs from AMD. This was partly done to hinder CPU {{remarking}} being done by questionable resellers around the globe. AMD's older CPUs could simply be set to run at whatever clock speed the user chose on the motherboard, making it trivial to relabel a CPU and sell it as a faster grade than it was originally intended. These relabeled CPUs were not always stable, being overclocked and not tested properly, and this was damaging to AMD's reputation. Although the Athlon was multiplier locked, crafty enthusiasts eventually discovered that a connector on the PCB of the cartridge could control the multiplier. Eventually a product called the [...] "Goldfingers device" [...] was created by inventors Ryan Petersen and Micheal Franz Schuete that could unlock the CPU, named after the gold connector pads on the <b>processor</b> <b>board</b> that it attached to.|$|E

50|$|The caches in the Firefly were direct-mapped for {{simplicity}} {{and to support}} multiprocessing; they used the Firefly protocol to ensure cache coherency. The caches on the MicroVAX <b>processor</b> <b>boards</b> had a capacity of 16 KB (4,096 4-byte lines) and were implemented with eleven 2 KB (4-bit by 4,096-word) SRAMs and twenty transistor-transistor logic (TTL) devices.

The caches on CVAX <b>processor</b> <b>boards</b> differed only in the capacity: 64 KB (16,384 4-byte lines) and were implemented with 8 KB (4-bit by 16,384-word) SRAMs.|$|R

50|$|Update Channel Interface {{is a set}} of 10 {{differential}} signal pairs that interconnect two slots. Which slots are interconnected depends on the particular backplane design.

5000|$|Workstations have {{typically}} been the drivers of advancements in CPU technology. Although both the consumer desktop and the workstation benefit from CPUs designed around the multicore concept (essentially, multiple processors on a die, {{the application of}} which IBM's POWER4 was a pioneer), modern workstations typically use multiple multicore CPUs, error correcting memory and much larger on-die caches than those found on [...] "consumer-level" [...] CPUs. Such power and reliability are not normally required on a general desktop computer. IBM's POWER-based <b>processor</b> <b>boards</b> and the workstation-level Intel-based Xeon <b>processor</b> <b>boards,</b> for example, have multiple CPUs, more on-die cache and ECC memory, which are features more suited to demanding content-creation, engineering and scientific work than to general desktop computing.|$|R
40|$|PA-RISC is Hewlett-Packard’s (HP) reduced {{instruction}} set computer (RISC) architecture {{that is used}} in its high-performance computer sys-tems (Mahon et al. 1986). Implementations of this architecture have produced some of the most complex <b>processor</b> <b>boards</b> that HP makes (Robinson et al. 1987; Gassman et al. 1987) : They can contain as many as 8 very large scale integrated (VLSI) chips—most of them custom, from central processing units to bus controllers to floating-point pro-cessors—several high-speed random-access memory arrays, one or more high-speed buses with over 100 lines, and many other compo-nents. In large part because of this complexity, the testing of PA-RISC <b>processor</b> <b>boards</b> became a bottleneck, resulting in an undesirable backlog of undiagnosed boards, growing at a rate of 10 percent each month...|$|R

5000|$|In 1982, Convergent {{formed a}} new {{division}} {{to focus on}} a multi-processor computer known as the MegaFrame. The MegaFrame ran a UNIX System III-derived operating system called CTIX on multiple Motorola 68010 processors. Three other I/O <b>processor</b> <b>boards</b> could also be placed in the system: the file processor, the cluster processor, and the terminal processor. All I/O <b>processor</b> <b>boards</b> were based on the Intel 80186 and ran a scaled-down version of CTOS. The MegaFrame division was headed by Ben Wegbreit; Steve Blank, in charge of division marketing, went on to found several Silicon Valley startups, including E.piphany, and [...] lectures on technology startups at Stanford University and elsewhere; Jon Huie in charge of Software; Richard Lowenthal in charge of Hardware.|$|R
