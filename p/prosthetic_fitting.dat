40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{substantial}} {{effort has been}} directed toward developing ultrasonic systems for medical imaging. With advances in computational power, previously theorized scanning methods such as ultrasound tomography can now be realized. This thesis presents the design, error analysis, and initial image reconstructions from a single element 3 D ultrasound tomography system. The system enables volumetric pulse echo or transmission imaging of distal limbs, for applications including: improving <b>prosthetic</b> <b>fittings,</b> monitoring bone density, and characterizing muscle health. The system is designed as a flexible mechanical platform for iterative development of algorithms targeting imaging of soft tissue with bone. The mechanical system independently controls movement of two single element ultrasound transducers in a cylindrical water tank. Each transducer can independently circle about {{the center of the}} tank as well as move vertically in depth. High resolution positioning feedback (~ 1 [mu]m) and control enables flexible positioning of the transmitter and the receiver around the cylindrical tank; exchangeable transducers enable algorithm testing with varying transducer frequencies and beam geometries. High speed data acquisition (DAQ) through a dedicated National Instrument PXI setup streams digitized data directly to the host PC. System positioning error has been quantified and is within limits for the desired imaging modality.

40|$|High-performance {{polymers}} (HPP) is {{a material}} based on PEEK (poly ether ether ketone) or PEKK (poly ether ketone ketone), {{which has already}} been successfully used in operations carried out on humans for many years. The material developed {{to meet the requirements}} of dental prosthetics, whose predecessors are being used successfully in human medicine for more than 30 years as spinal intermediate bodies, knuckle joints and hip joint prosthetics, heart valve replacements, so that their bio-compatibility and mechanical properties are already tried and tested. High-performance polymers are greater interest due to a demand for products with optimal physical and aesthetic properties. The material has high flexural and compressive strength. These qualities, coupled with a low modulus of elasticity and therefore low brittleness, ensure the material delivers permanent elasticity. High-performance polymers a measurable resistance of 600 MPs, which clearly shows that this material has got characteristic features that provide more security. Unlike the materials used so far for skeleton restorations, the elastic characteristics of HPP are adaptable to the bone. These high-performance polymers have high long-term stability and low water retention. HPP offers three different options of processing: HPP as milling blank with special cutter for the manufacture of <b>prosthetic</b> <b>fittings</b> in the common CAD/CAM processes. Processing of HPP by means of a pressing procedure, through the for 2 press system, a specially developed vacuum pressing device. Third option is 3 d printing on polymer material. The white colour ensures that no dark shadows show through the gingiva. Opaques are therefore not required any more. The innovative material HPP offers new possibilities of fitting patients with fixed and removable high-value dental prosthetics on implants or natural teeth - from individual abutments to telescoping prosthetics, and is ideal framework material for composite veneers for patients with bruxism who require a restoration.

30|$|Most authors {{agree that}} {{lengthening}} {{is the preferred}} treatment for patients with mild to moderate leg length discrepancy with mild foot deformities (Paley types 1 and 2). The controversial cases are those that include more severe foot deformities (Paley types 3 and 4) and greater leg length discrepancies due to more severe tibial growth inhibition or combined femoral and tibial discrepancy. Syme’s or Boyd amputation has been the conventional recommendation for these more severe cases [37]. The justification for amputation for the more severe cases has been the failure of most surgeons to obtain satisfactory results after limb lengthening [38, 39, 40]. No one would dispute that amputation with <b>prosthetic</b> <b>fitting</b> requires fewer surgical interventions and fewer days of hospitalization and {{is associated with a}} lower complication rate. Furthermore, no one would dispute that with the availability of modern prosthetics, limb length equalization with excellent function can be achieved reliably in patients who have undergone Syme’s or Boyd amputation [28, 37, 41]. This does not prove, however, that the best treatment for severe cases of FH is amputation with <b>prosthetic</b> <b>fitting.</b> Excellent function could also be obtained if amputation and <b>prosthetic</b> <b>fitting</b> were used to treat clubfoot, ankle arthritis or other disabling foot conditions.

40|$|A novel capacitance-based sensor {{designed}} for monitoring mechanical stresses at the stump–socket interface of lower-limb amputees is described. It provides practical means of measuring pressure and shear stresses simultaneously. In particular, {{it comprises of}} a flexible frame (20 mm × 20 mm), with thickness of 4 mm. By employing rapid prototyping technology in its fabrication, it offers a low-cost and versatile solution, with capability of adopting bespoke shapes of lower-limb residua. The sensor was first analysed using finite element analysis (FEA) and then evaluated using lab-based electromechanical tests. The results validate that the sensor is capable of monitoring both pressure and shear at stresses up to 350 kPa and 80 kPa, respectively. A post-signal processing model is developed to induce pressure and shear stresses, respectively. The effective separation of pressure and shear signals can be potentially advantageous for sensor calibration in clinical applications. The sensor also demonstrates high linearity (approx. 5 – 8 %) and high pressure (approx. 1. 3 kPa) and shear (approx. 0. 6 kPa) stress resolution performance. Accordingly, the sensor offers the potential for exploitation as an assistive tool to both evaluate <b>prosthetic</b> socket <b>fitting</b> in clinical settings and alert amputees in home settings of excessive loading at the stump–socket interface, effectively preventing stump tissue breakdown at an early stage...|$|R
