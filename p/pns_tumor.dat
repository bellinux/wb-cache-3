40|$|BACKGROUND: We have {{previously}} {{shown that the}} transcription factor c-Fos is also capable of associating to endoplasmic reticulum membranes (ER) and activating phospholipid synthesis. Herein we examined phospholipid synthesis status in brain tumors from human patients and from NPcis mice, an animal model of the human disease Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF 1). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In human samples, c-Fos expression was at the limit of detection in non-pathological specimens, but was abundantly expressed associated to ER membranes in tumor cells. This was also observed in CNS of adult tumor-bearing NPcis mice but not in NPcis fos(-/-) KO mice. A glioblastoma multiforme and a malignant <b>PNS</b> <b>tumor</b> from a NF 1 patient (MPNST) showed a 2 - and 4 - fold c-Fos-dependent phospholipid synthesis activation, respectively. MPNST samples also showed increased cell proliferation rates and abundant c-Fos expression. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight a role of cytoplasmic c-Fos as an activator of phospholipid synthesis in events demanding high rates of membrane biogenesis as occurs for the exacerbated growth of tumors cells. They also disclose this protein as a potential target for controlling tumor growth in the nervous system...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Nodal {{categories}} for malignant pleural mesothelioma {{are derived from}} the lung cancer staging system and have not been adequately validated. The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer developed a multinational database to generate evidence-based recommendations to inform the eighth edition of the TNM classification of malignant pleural mesothelioma. METHODS Data from 29 centers were entered prospectively (n = 1566) or by transfer of retrospective data (n = 1953). Survival according to the seventh edition N categories was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Survival was measured from the date of diagnosis. RESULTS There were 2432 analyzable cases: 1603 had clinical (c) staging, 1614 had pathologic (p) staging, and 785 had both. For clinically staged tumors there was no separation in Kaplan-Meier curves between cN 0, cN 1 or cN 2 (cN 1 versus cN 0 hazard ratio [HR] = 1. 06, p = 0. 77 and cN 2 versus cN 1 HR = 1. 04, p = 0. 85). For pathologically staged <b>tumors,</b> patients with <b>pN</b> 1 or <b>pN</b> 2 <b>tumors</b> had worse survival than those with <b>pN</b> 0 <b>tumors</b> (HR = 1. 51, p <  0. 0001) but no survival difference was noted between those with pN 1 and <b>pN</b> 2 <b>tumors</b> (HR = 0. 99, p = 0. 99). Patients with both pN 1 and pN 2 nodal involvement had poorer survival than those with <b>pN</b> 2 <b>tumors</b> only (HR = 1. 60, p = 0. 007) or <b>pN</b> 0 <b>tumors</b> (HR = 1. 62, p < 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS A recommendation to collapse both clinical and pN 1 and pN 2 categories into a single N category comprising ipsilateral, intrathoracic nodal metastases (N 1) will {{be made for the}} eighth edition staging system. Nodes previously categorized as N 3 will be reclassified as N 2...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Vascular {{invasion}} is {{an adverse}} prognostic factor in colorectal cancer and often {{is considered an}} indication for systemic adjuvant therapy. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a predictive model of vascular invasion in a large cohort of colon cancers with use of tumor-related features and immunohistochemical analysis of protein markers. METHODS: A tissue microarray including 427 colon cancers was evaluated for 14 immunohistochemical protein markers. Complete data on pT, <b>pN,</b> <b>tumor</b> grade, tumor border configuration, vascular invasion, and tumor diameter were available. Classification and regression tree analysis was performed. RESULTS: The presence of vascular invasion independently predicted adverse outcome (P > 0. 001; hazard ratio = 1. 52 (1. 3 to 1. 8)) and decreased survival from 49. 0 to 19. 0 months (P > 0. 001) even in lymph node-positive patients. Tumor border configuration, Ki 67, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, and Raf- 1 kinase inhibitor protein expression were predictive of vascular invasion. The cross-validated misclassification rate was 23. 7 percent indicating a significant predictive accuracy of this model. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor border configuration, Ki 67, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, and Raf- 1 kinase inhibitor protein immunohistochemistry are highly predictive of vascular invasion and may play a decisive role in individualizing adjuvant treatment...|$|R
40|$|The proneural (PN) and mesenchymal (MES) subtypes of {{glioblastoma}} multiforme (GBM) are robust and generally consistent with classification schemes. GBMs in the MES subclass are predominantly primary tumors that, compared to <b>PN</b> <b>tumors,</b> exhibit a worse prognosis; thus, understanding {{the mechanism of}} MES differentiation may be of great benefit {{for the treatment of}} GBM. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling is critically important in GBM, and activation of NF-κB could induce MES transdifferentiation in GBM, which warrants additional research. NUDT 21 is a newly discovered tumor-associated gene according to our current research. The exact roles of NUDT 21 in cancer incidence have not been elucidated. Here, we report that NUDT 21 expression was upregulated in human glioma tissues and that NUDT 21 promoted glioma cell proliferation, likely through the NF-κB signaling pathway. Gene set enrichment analysis, western blotting, and quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed that NF-κB inhibitor zeta (NFKBIZ) was a downstream target affected by NUDT 21 and that the MES identity genes in glioblastoma cells, CHI 3 L 1 and FN 1, were also differentially regulated. Our results suggest that NUDT 21 is an upstream regulator of the NF-κB pathway and a potential molecular target for the MES subtype of GBM...|$|R

To analyze the clinical value of pre- and postoperative CA 19 - 9 serum levels in stage I and II pancreatic cancer. We analyzed 61 patients resected for pancreatic cancer. Patients were evaluated about the pre-operative CA 19 - 9 values and then divided into 3 groups: high, high-low and low, {{on the basis}} of pre- and postoperative CA 19 - 9 levels. The correlations between these groups and age, sex, pT, <b>pN,</b> <b>tumor</b> stage, jaundice, surgical radicality, tumor size, number of harvested and positive lymph nodes, grading, overall and major morbidities and post-operative mortality together with survival rates were analyzed. Higher values of pre-operative CA 19 - 9 were significantly correlated to the presence of jaundice, high pT, pN, stage and higher number of metastatic lymph nodes. In 49 patients (80. 3  %) an R 0 resection was performed. Five-year overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) were significantly better in patients with high levels of pre-operative CA 19 - 9, even in R 0 cases. After stratification, 30 patients were included in the high group, 13 in the high-low group and 18 in the low group. A statistically significant correlation was found between the CA 19 - 9 groups and the lymph nodal positivity, not between CA 19 - 9 and pT. OS and DFS were significantly better in low group patients. We confirm the prognostic value of preoperative CA 19 - 9 serum levels.

40|$|DNA {{methylation}} is {{a critical}} epigenetic mechanism involved in key cellular processes. Its deregulation {{has been linked to}} many human cancers including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). This study was designed to explore the whole methylation status of ESCC and to identify potential plasma biomarkers for early diagnosis. We used Infinium Methylation 450 k array to analyze ESCC tissues (n = 4), paired normal surrounding tissues (n = 4) and normal mucosa from healthy individuals (n = 4), and combined these with gene expression data from the GEO database. One hundred and sixty eight genes had differentially methylated CpG sites in their promoter region and a gene expression pattern inverse to the direction of change in DNA methylation. These genes were involved in several cancer-related pathways. Three genes were validated in additional 42 ESCC tissues and paired normal surrounding tissues. The methylation frequency of EPB 41 L 3, GPX 3, and COL 14 A 1 were higher in tumor tissues than in normal surrounding tissues (P < 0. 017). The higher methylation frequency of EPB 41 l 3 was correlated with large tumor size (P = 0. 044) and advanced pT tumor stage (P = 0. 001). The higher methylation frequency of GPX 3 and COL 14 A 1 were correlated with advanced <b>pN</b> <b>tumor</b> stage (P = 0. 001 and P < 0. 001). The methylation of EPB 41 L 3, GPX 3, and COL 14 A 1 genes were only found in ESCC patients' plasma, but not in normal individuals upon testing 42 ESCC patients and 50 healthy individuals. Diagnostic sensitivity was increased when methylation of any of the 3 genes were counted (64. 3 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity). These differentially methylated genes in plasma may be used as biomarkers for early diagnosis of ESCC...|$|R

Our study aimed to analyze PN expression in different histological variants of PTC and to correlate its expression with the clinicopathological prognostic factors. Material and Methods. PN expression has been immunohistochemically assessed in 50 cases of PTC (conventional, follicular, oncocytic, macrofollicular, and tall cell variants), in tumor epithelial cells and intratumoral stroma. The association between PN expression and clinicopathological characteristics has been evaluated. Results. Our results show that PTC presented different patterns of PN immunoreaction, stromal PN being significantly associated with advanced tumor stage and extrathyroidal extension. No correlations were found between <b>PN</b> overexpression in <b>tumor</b> epithelial cells and clinicopathological features, except for specific histological variants, the highest risk of poor outcome being registered for the conventional subtype in comparison to the oncocytic type.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} to ascertain if nutrition support (NS), either as parenteral nutrition (PN) or enteral nutrition (EN), stimulates tumor growth and causes cancer progression, but after almost 30 years, the question remains at least in part unresolved.

MEDLINE and PubMed were searched using combinations of the following keywords: <b>PN,</b> EN, <b>tumor</b> growth, tumor proliferation, tumor apoptosis, arginine, ω- 3 fatty acids, and glutamine. Unfortunately, the effect of nutrition support on tumor growth has been assessed only in terms of tumor proliferation, whereas the interferences on tumor apoptosis have never been determined. Overall, the results seem conflicting and inconclusive. Similarly, it remains unknown if PN or EN enriched with specific nutrients such as arginine, ω- 3 fatty acids, and glutamine can affect tumor growth in humans.

40|$|Purpose: Natural orifice {{specimen}} extraction (NOSE) is an ever-evolving advanced laparoscopic technique. NOSE minimizes surgical injury, {{involving a}} low risk of wound complications, fewer incisional hernias, faster recovery and less postoperative pain. Laparoscopic gastrectomy combined with NOSE is {{a procedure that}} can potentiate the advantages of both minimal invasive techniques. We aim to demonstrate the feasibility of laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy with transvaginal specimen extraction in advanced gastric cancer. Case: A 72 -year-old woman with a 2  cm adenocarcinoma in gastric antrum was treated by laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy and lymph node dissection. A totally laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy was constructed. Specimen was extracted through the posterior fornix of vagina without difficulty. Histopathology confirmed pT 3 <b>pN</b> 0 <b>tumor.</b> After a 10 -month follow-up the patient was asymptomatic and getting adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Conclusions: Transvaginal specimen extraction after laparoscopic gastric resection for advanced gastric cancer is a feasible procedure.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{whether the}} presence and severity of preoperative hydronephrosis have prognostic significance in patients who underwent radical cystectomy for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. The medical records of 457 patients who underwent radical cystectomy for bladder cancer between 1986 and 2005 were retrospectively reviewed. Following the Society for Fetal Urology grading system, patients were divided into low-, and high-grade hydronephrosis groups. Clinicopathologic factors associated with preoperative hydronephrosis and survival were evaluated. Of a total of 406 patients, unilateral hydronephrosis was found in 74 (18. 2 %), bilateral hydronephrosis in 11 (2. 7 %), and no hydronephoris in 321 (79. 1 %). Low-grade hydronephrosis was found in 57 (12. 2 %) patients and high-grade hydronephrosis in 28 (6 %). Preoperative hydronephrosis was related to higher pT stage and lymph node invasion. In univariate analysis, the presence of hydronephrosis, hydronephrosis grade, age, pT and <b>pN</b> stage, <b>tumor</b> grade, surgical margin, number of retrieved nodes, carcinoma in situ, and lymphovascular invasion were significant prognostic factors for cancer-specific survival.

MethodsIntrathoracic lymph nodes (n = 1063) from 60 patients with non–small cell carcinoma of the lung were studied for the presence of metastases with serial histologic sections and keratin immunostains. Metastases were classified as isolated <b>tumor</b> cells, <b>pN</b> 1 mi, pN 1, pN 2 mi, and <b>pN</b> 2. Isolated <b>tumor</b> cells were smaller than 0. 2 mm, while pN 1 mi and pN 2 mi measured 0. 2 mm to 2 mm. Survival analysis was performed, stratifying by nodal status and stage. ResultsIsolated tumor cells were detected in 11 lymph nodes from 5 of 33 pN 0 patients and in 9 pN 1 and pN 2 patients. The lymph nodes from 3 patients were reclassified as pN 1 mi. No pN 2 mi were detected. A survival model based on a stratification of the cohort into stages I to III was significant (chi-square = 7. 426, df = 2, P =. 024) but demonstrated considerable overlap between the survival curves of stage I and II patients. A model stratifying isolated <b>tumor</b> cells and <b>pN</b> 1 mi into stage I disease was significant (chi-square = 7. 985, df = 2, P =. 018) and showed no overlap between the survival curves of stage I and II patients. There were no significant survival function differences between patients with <b>pN</b> 0, isolated <b>tumor</b> cells, and <b>pN</b> 1 mi. ConclusionsPatients with non–small cell carcinoma of the lung with isolated <b>tumor</b> cells and <b>pN</b> 1 mi have similar survivals to those with pN 0, consistent with the findings reported for breast cancer patients. Future larger studies of patients with non–small cell carcinoma of the lung are needed to confirm whether current American Joint Committee on Cancer staging criteria should be modified to include the pN 1 mi category...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the expression of}} two different lymphatic vascular density (LVD) markers (D 2 - 40 and LYVE- 1) and a lymphangiogenic cytokine (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-C, [VEGF-C]) in prostate carcinoma and to investigate {{their relationship with the}} lymph node status. Settings and Design: Archival material study of 92 non-consecutive radical prostatectomy specimens. Materials and Methods: The mean LVD was assessed immunohistochemically in 24 prostate carcinoma specimens from patients with clinically localized disease, who were found to have nodal metastasis (pN 1), and was compared with 68 pN 0 cases. Furthermore, the mean LVD, VEGF-C expression, and lymphatic invasion were examined in relation to lymph node involvement. Results: Peritumoral (but not intratumoral) mean LVD assessed by D 2 - 40 was higher in <b>pN</b> 1 <b>tumors</b> (P = 0. 015). LYVE- 1 expression was limited and not associated with lymph node status. The VEGF-C expression was higher in the N 1 cases and also correlated with the increased mean LVD in both the peri- and intratumoral compartments. Lymphatic invasion was strongly associated with nodal metastasis and higher VEGF-C expression. Conclusions: Our results indicate that increased peritumoral (but not intratumoral) LVD in the tumor specimen is associated with lymph node metastasis. Increased expression of VEGF-C is associated with higher LVD (in both intratumoral and peritumoral compartments) and with positive lymph node status, indicating a possible dual role in both lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic vessel invasion...|$|R
40|$|Prostate {{adenocarcinoma}} (CaP) {{patients are}} classified into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups that reflect relative survival categories. While there are accepted treatment regimens for low- and high-risk patients, intermediate-risk patients pose a clinical dilemma, as treatment outcomes are highly variable for these individuals. A {{better understanding of}} the factors that regulate the progression of CaP is required to delineate risk. For example, aberrant activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is implicated in CaP progression. Here, we identify the serine protease inhibitor protease nexin 1 (PN 1) as a negative regulator of Hh signaling in prostate. Using human CaP cell lines and a mouse xenograft model of CaP, we demonstrate that PN 1 regulates Hh signaling by decreasing protein levels of the Hh ligand Sonic (SHH) and its downstream effectors. Furthermore, we show that SHH expression enhanced tumor growth while overexpression of <b>PN</b> 1 inhibited <b>tumor</b> growth and angiogenesis in mice.

40|$|We {{recently}} found that NFATc 1, {{a member of}} the NFAT family and a key regulator of the immune response, could induce bladder carcinogenesis and cancer progression. In this study, we immunohistochemically stained for NFATc 1 in upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UUTUC) specimens and paired nonneoplastic urothelial tissues. NFATc 1 was positive in 51 [52 %; 40 (40 %) weak (1 +), 9 (9 %) moderate (2 +), and 2 (2 %) strong (3 +) ] of 99 UUTUCs, which was significantly higher than in benign urothelium [30 (36 %) of 83; 28 (34 %) weak and 2 (2 %) moderate] (0 vs 1 +/ 2 +/ 3 +, P = . 038; 0 / 1 + vs 2 +/ 3 +, P = . 023). There were no significant associations between NFATc 1 expression pattern and tumor grade or pT stage. However, the positive rates of NFATc 1 expression tended to be higher in renal pelvic tumors (60 %) than in ureteral tumors (42 %; P = . 080) as well as in pN+ tumors (75 %) than in <b>pN</b> 0 <b>tumors</b> (49 %; P = . 089). Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests revealed that moderate (2 +) to strong (3 +) NFATc 1 expression correlated with lower progression-free survival (P = . 032) and cancer-specific survival (P = . 005) rates in the 99 cases. Patients with high (2 +/ 3 +) NFATc 1 muscle-invasive tumor (n =  9) also had a significantly higher risk of cancer-specific mortality (P = . 021) compared to those with low (0 / 1 +) NFATc 1 muscle-invasive tumor (n =  53). Thus, compared with nonneoplastic urothelium, {{a significant increase in the}} expression of NFATc 1 in UUTUC was seen, implying the involvement of NFATc 1 signals in the development of UUTUC.

We report our experiences on EBV in collections of gastro-esophageal adenocarcinomas from two surgical centers and discuss the current state of research in this field. Tumor samples from 465 primary resected gastro-esophageal adenocarcinomas (118 EAC, 73 GEJ and 274 GC) were investigated. Presence of EBV was determined by EBV-encoded small RNAs (EBER) in situ hybridization. Results were correlated with pathologic parameters (UICC pTNM category, Her 2 status, tumor grading) and survival. EBER positivity was observed in 14 cases. None of the EAC were positive for EBER. In contrast, we observed EBER positivity in 2 / 73 adenocarcinomas of the GEJ (2. 7 %) and 12 / 274 GC (4. 4 %). These were of intestinal type (7 cases) or unclassifiable (6 cases), while only one case was of diffuse type according to the Lauren classification. No association between EBV and pT, <b>pN</b> or <b>tumor</b> grading was found, neither was there a correlation with clinical outcome. None of the EBER positive cases were Her 2 positive. In conclusion, EBV does not seem to play a role in the carcinogenesis of EAC. Moreover adenocarcinomas of the GEJ show lower rates of EBV positivity compared to GC. Our data only partially correlate with previous reports from the literature. This highlights the need for further research on this distinct entity. Recent reports, however, have identified specific epigenetic and genetic alterations in EBV-associated GC, which might lead to a distinct treatment approach for this specific subtype of GC in the future...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to clarify the prognostic importance of several well-known but still debated pathological variables related to the survival of colon cancer patients. The study focuses on the definition and survival carried by the pT 4 category and stage II where the presence of high-risk variables may determine whether or not adjuvant chemotherapy is administered. A retrospective nationwide study was carried out including all colon cancer patients that underwent resection in Iceland between 1990 and 2004 (n[*]=[*] 889). All histopathology was reassessed. Cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival were analysed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis. In stage II, the five-year CSS for pT 4 was 50 % (95 % CI, 32 - 69 %), which was the lowest survival observed in that stage. In stage III the five-year CSS was 30 % (95 % CI, 18 - 41 %) and 37 % (95 % CI, 26 - 48 %) for pT 4 and <b>pN</b> 2 <b>tumors,</b> respectively. Lymphatic invasion and differentiation had no prognostic value in stage II. The survival associated with pT 4 a versus pT 4 b depends on how these categories are defined with regard to Shepherd's local peritoneal involvement (LPI). In the present series, pT 4 is a major indicator of poor prognosis in patients with stage II and III colon carcinoma. Four-tiered TNM or Dukes staging systems are insufficient by not taking this variable into account. Only Shepherd's LPI 4 and a subgroup of LPI 3 (i. e., borderline LPI 3 /LPI 4) should qualify for the pT 4 a subcategory.

Recent studies have shown that <b>PN</b> for renal <b>tumors</b> had superior intermediate-term preservation of renal function, and similar recurrence rate compared with RN (Favaretto et al. 2013; Lane et al. 2010). Our results suggested that the PN should be considered first for the T 1 b tumor whose size was close to 4  cm, namely the threshold of tumor size of 4  cm for PN should been expanded to some extent.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{retrospectively}} evaluate survival, progression-free survival (PFS) {{and biological}} response {{in a series}} of patients irradiated with mixed neutron/photon beams for locally advanced prostate cancer in our institution. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred and eight patients were treated between January 1990 and December 1996. Fifty-five of these were recruited for pT 3 or <b>pN</b> 1 <b>tumors</b> after radical prostatectomy. Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation was given in 106 patients. The treatment protocol consisted of a mixed photon/neutron irradiation in a two-to-three proportion, up to a total equivalent dose of 66 Gy (assuming a clinical RBE value of 2. 8). Pre- and post-treatment PSA determinations were available in practically all cases. Study endpoints were overall survival (OAS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to investigate the prognostic value of baseline characteristics on survival and progression-free survival were a progression was defined as local, regional, metastatic or biological progression. Mean age was 69 years (49 - 86); mean pretreatment PSA was 15 (0. 5 - 330) in all patients and 14 (0. 5 - 160) in those receiving neoadjuvant hormonotherapy; seven patients only had an initial PSA or = 20 ng/mL was the same. PFS could be predicted by two optimal Cox regression models, one including histological grade (p = 0. 003) and initial PSA (p = 0. 0009) as cofactors, the other including histological grade (p = 0. 003) and T stage (p = 0. 02). The main prognostic factors for overall survival were PSA and age. Biological responses with PSA < 1. 5 ng/mL, < 1 ng/mL and < 0. 5 ng/mL at any time after treatment were documented in 70 %, 61 % and 47 % of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Five-year OAS was 79 %, PFS was 64 %, and biological response was 70 % for prostate cancer patients treated with mixed photon/neutron beams as applied at Louvain-la-Neuve, which are good results as compared with the literature. The usual prognostic factors were confirmed...|$|R
40|$|For many decades, radical {{nephrectomy}} (RN) {{has been}} {{the gold standard for}} the treatment of localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, emerging evidence suggests that RN is a significant risk factor for the development of new-onset chronic kidney disease (CKD) or worsening of pre-existing CKD and leads to more cardiovascular events and worse survival [1 – 4]. Renal excision increases the risk factors for CKD by favoring arterial hypertension, proteinuria, hyperparathyroidism, anemia and metabolic acidosis. Patients are more likely to die of competing risks such as cardiovascular death than to die of the cancer itself. Owing to the higher risk of CKD following RN, the status of RN has been called into question. Other contributing factors are an increased incidental detection of small (< 4 cm) renal masses with a significant proportion of benign tumors, the possibility of late recurrence of RCC in the contralateral kidney and the equal oncologic efficacy as partial nephrectomy (<b>PN)</b> for renal <b>tumors</b> less than 4 cm [5, 6] and tumors between 4 and 7 cm [7, 8]. A study in patients with localized RCC of 4 cm or less and a normal contralateral kidney showed that compared with PN, RN was associated with decreased overall survival (OS) in young patients (< 65 years) with small renal masses [9]. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionThe tumor, node, {{metastasis}} (TNM) {{system has}} been recognized internationally as the standard for staging disease extension, but despite the improvements of the 1997 / 2002 international staging system, there may be marked differences in postoperative 5 -year survival rates within each stage. There is controversy {{about the impact of}} tumor size itself as a variable unrelated to stage. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the influence of tumor size on the survival in patients with surgically resected non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). MethodsBetween August 1985 and January 2006, 400 patients underwent pulmonary resection with a curative intention for non-small cell lung carcinoma. Patients were excluded if they had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The clinicopathological records of each patient were examined for prognostic factors such as age, sex, right or left side cancer, histology, tumor location, tumor size, clinical nodal stage number, and distribution of metastatic nodes. ResultsOperative mortality was 2. 2 % for lobectomy and 18 % for pneumonectomy (p < 0. 05). Adenocarcinoma was the most common type (n = 245, 61. 2 %). Surgery was considered a complete resection in 341 patients (85. 2 %). When only patients without neoplastic hilar or mediastinal metastases (pN 0) were included, the difference in survival was significantly different in terms of tumor size (log rank 28. 46, p < 0. 0001). Univariate analysis for the group of pN 0 patients showed survival was not significantly affected by age, sex, side, or adenocarcinoma histology. In the multivariate analysis, tumor size and the T factor were found to have maintained its independent prognostic effects on overall survival. Among patients with <b>pN</b> 0 <b>tumors</b> smaller that 15 mm in diameter, 5 -year survival was 95 % whereas patients with tumors bigger than 16 mm in diameter had a 5 -year survival of 65 % (p < 0. 0001). ConclusionIn conclusion, our data suggest that tumors over 15 mm are associated with shorter 5 -year survival in all TNM stages. Current TNM categories are not sufficiently discriminatory and the T factor requires to be reevaluated in further revisions of the TNM classification...|$|R
40|$|Eighty {{patients}} {{affected by}} supraglottic cancer were treated by transoral carbon dioxide laser surgery between 1989 and 2006 in two Italian institutions. Patient staging was as follows: 2 pTis, 20 pT 1, 38 pT 2, and 20 pT 3. Simultaneous or 1 -month delayed neck dissection (ND) {{was performed on}} 27 (34 %) patients, unilaterally in 10 and bilaterally in 17. The pN category was as follows: 9 pN 0, 6 pN 1, 8 pN 2 b, and 4 pN 2 c. A total of 16 (20 %) patients received complementary radiotherapy (RT) and 5 (6 %) were subjected to chemo-RT for persistent tumor after re-excision due to positive margins, multiple lymph nodes, and/or extracapsular spread after ND. The last follow-up was in December 2008. The 5 -year overall, disease-specific and disease-free survivals, local control with laser alone, and organ preservation rates calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis were 84. 4, 97. 4, 88. 3, 96, and 97. 2 %, respectively. Univariate analysis showed a statistically significant impact on disease-free survival, local control with laser alone, and organ preservation of pT category (p = 0. 009, p = 0. 01, and p = 0. 03, respectively), while <b>pN</b> category and <b>tumor</b> stage negatively influenced disease-free survival (p = 0. 007 and p = 0. 01, respectively).

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} diagnostic ureteroscopy on intravesical recurrence in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) after radical nephroureterectomy (RNU). Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 664 patients who were treated with RNU for UTUC from June 2000 to December 2011, excluding those who had concomitant/prior bladder tumors. Of the 664 patients, 81 underwent diagnostic ureteroscopy (URS). We analyzed the impact of diagnostic ureteroscopy on intravesical recurrence (IVR) using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to {{determine the}} independent risk factors. Results: The median follow-up time was 48 months (interquartile range (IQR) : 31 - 77 months). Patients who underwent ureteroscopy {{were more likely to have}} a small (p< 0. 01), early-staged (p= 0. 019), multifocality (p= 0. 035) and ureteral tumor (p< 0. 001). IVR occurred in 223 patients during follow-up within a median of 17 months (IQR: 7 - 33). Patients without preoperative ureteroscopy have a statistically significant better 2 -year (79. 3 %± 0. 02 versus 71. 4 %± 0. 02, p< 0. 001) and 5 -year intravesical recurrence-free survival rates (64. 9 %± 0. 05 versus 44. 3 %± 0. 06, p< 0. 001) than patients who underwent ureteroscopy. In multivariate analysis, the diagnostic ureteroscopy (p= 0. 006), multiple tumors (p= 0. 001), tumor size < 3 cm (p= 0. 008), low-grade (p= 0. 022) and <b>pN</b> 0 stage <b>tumor</b> (p= 0. 045) were independent predictors of IVR.

40|$|Introduction: Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma (UTUC) is a {{rare disease}} with few {{prognostic}} determinants. We sought to evaluate the impact of tumor size and location on patient survival following nephroureterectomy for UTUC. Materials and Methods: Data on 8284 patients treated with radical nephroureterectomy for UTUC in the United States between 1998 and 2011 were analyzed from the National Cancer Data Base. Univariable survivorship curves were generated based on pT stage, <b>pN</b> stage, grade, <b>tumor</b> size, and tumor site (renal pelvis vs. ureter). A Cox proportional hazards model {{was used to evaluate}} the effect of age, comorbidity, T stage, lymph node involvement, tumor site, and tumor size on survival. Results: The median follow-up time was 46 months. A majority of the patients were male (55. 4 %) with a tumor size of ≥ 3. 5 cm (52. 0 %) and pT stage <T 2 (47. 8 %). The overall 5 years survival overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort was 51. 6 %. When stratified by tumor size < 3. 5 cm or ≥ 3. 5 cm the 5 -year OS was 45. 9 % and 58. 5 %, respectively. On multivariable analysis controlling for age, Charlson comorbidity index, grade, and tumor stage, tumor size ≥ 3. 5 cm was independently predictive of worse OS (odds ratio: 1. 13 [95 % confidence interval: 1. 02 – 1. 26], P = 0. 023). Conclusions: Using the largest series of patients with UTUC undergoing nephroureterectomy, we demonstrated a worse survival in patients with larger tumor sizes (≥ 3. 5 cm) but no difference in survival based on tumor location while controlling for other pathologic characteristics. Incorporation of tumor size into perioperative risk modeling may help with patient stratification and provide further prognostic information for patient counseling...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and Objectives : Mortality due to AKI has {{not changed}} {{significantly}} over the past 50 years. This {{is due in part}} to failure to detect early AKI and to initiate appropriate therapeutic measures. There is therefore a need to identify biomarkers that would improve the early detection of AKI. The objective of this study was to assess whether cystatin C levels obtained at specific timepoints during laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (PN) could be early predictors of AKI. Materials and Methods: Twenty-five patients underwent laparoscopic <b>PN</b> for organ-confined <b>tumors.</b> All procedures were performed by two surgeons in a single institution. Plasma samples were collected preoperatively, and post-unclamping at 5, 20, 120 min and on the day following surgery. Plasma cystatin C was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Correlation between levels of cystatin C and other parameters of interest were assessed in order to define cystatin C ability to predict AKI and loss of renal function following laparoscopic PN. Results: The mean baseline eGFR was 93 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2. Warm ischemia time varied between 16 and 44 min. Post-operative day 1 (POD 1) cystatin C levels compared to baseline were increased in 13 (52 %) of the patients. There was a high correlation between the difference of POD 1 and baseline value, and eGFR in the immediate postoperative period (r = − 0. 681; P = 0. 0002) and at 12 -month follow-up (r = − 0. 460, P = 0. 048). However, the variation in cystatin C levels at earlier timepoints were not associated to AKI nor renal function. Conclusions: High increase in POD 1 cystatin C levels from baseline may help identify patients with AKI and those at higher risk of chronic kidney disease, following laparoscopic PN...|$|R
40|$|Background. Previous {{knowledge}} of {{cervical lymph node}} compromise may be crucial to choose the best treatment strategy in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Here we propose a set four genes, whose mRNA expression in the primary tumor predicts nodal status in OSCC, excluding tongue. Material and methods. We identified differentially expressed genes in OSCC with and without compromised lymph nodes using Differential Display RT-PCR. Known genes were chosen to be validated by means of Northern blotting or real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Thereafter we constructed a Nodal Index (NI) using discriminant analysis in a learning set of 35 patients, which was further validated in a second independent group of 20 patients. Results. Of the 63 differentially expressed known genes identified comparing three lymph node positive (pN+) and three negative (<b>pN</b> 0) primary <b>tumors,</b> 23 were analyzed by Northern analysis or RT-PCR in 49 primary tumors. Six genes confirmed as differentially expressed were used to construct a NI, as the best set predictive of lymph nodal status, with the final result including four genes. The NI was able to correctly classify 32 of 35 patients comprising the learning group (88. 6 %; p = 0. 009). Casein kinase 1 alpha 1 and scavenger receptor class B, member 2 {{were found to be}} up regulated in pN + group in contrast to small proline-rich protein 2 B and Ras-GTPase activating protein SH 3 domain-binding protein 2 which were upregulated in the pN 0 group. We validated further our NI in an independent set of 20 primary tumors, 11 of them pN 0 and nine pN+ with an accuracy of 80. 0 % (p = 0. 012). Conclusions. The NI was an independent predictor of compromised lymph nodes, taking into the consideration tumor size and histological grade.

40|$|Background: Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) {{followed}} by whole-breast irradiation (WBI) are {{the standard of}} care for treating early-stage breast cancer. The efficacy of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) has recently been investigated {{as an alternative to}} WBI. Although we previously reported that multicatheter brachytherapy in APBI is feasible in Japanese patients, long-term data of several APBI techniques have not yet been obtained. Here we estimated the long-term efficacy of multicatheter brachytherapy in Japanese patients with breast cancer to validate its use an individualized case–control (ICC) analysis. Method: From October 2008 to March 2013, a total of 184 consequent patients with 188 tumors underwent BCS {{followed by}} multicatheter brachytherapy. A total of 120 consecutive patients (mean age, 55. 1 years) with 122 <b>tumors</b> (<b>pN</b> 0) who had at least 1 year of follow-up were enrolled in this analysis. Before lumpectomy, the insertion of applicators and delivery doses were simulated by computed tomography. After confirming the free margins and negative sentinel node metastases by frozen section analysis, the applicators were inserted. APBI therapy was initiated on the same day of surgery {{on the basis of the}} dose distribution analysis, at 32 Gy in 8 fractions over 5 – 6 days with a 2 -cm tumor margin coverage. Regarding our prospective follow-up policy in this observational study, all patients had a predefined schedule including clinical examination every 3 – 4 months and mammography and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) every 12 months. We performed ICC analysis to estimate the number of patients with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). The 10 -year risk of IBTR for each patient when undergoing with WBI was calculated using the web-based decision-making tool IBTR! and was adjusted during the real-time follow-up period using data obtained from an overview by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group. Results: The median follow-up period was 3. 1 years (range, 1. 1 – 4. 4 years). Most tumors (92. 6 %) were ? 2 cm in diameter, and 89. 4 % were estrogen receptor-positive. Hormone therapy was administered in 86. 7 % and adjuvant chemotherapy in 20. 0 % patients. If all patients received WBI after BCS, we estimated IBTR in this group to be 1. 1 – 2. 8. Although 1 IBTR was observed, no tumor bed recurrence was recorded. Conclusions: Although this study involved only a small number of patients and short follow-up period, only 1 IBTR case was recorded, which was within the estimated range of local recurrence. Multicatheter brachytherapy using this technique may offer the same rates of local control as WBI in Japanese patients. </p...|$|R
