25|$|Before {{a verdict}} was issued {{in the new}} 1993 Rodney King federal civil rights trial against the four officers, Korean shop owners <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> as fear ran {{throughout}} the city, gun sales went up, virtually all of them by those of Korean descent, some merchants at flea markets removed their merchandise from their shelves, storefronts were fortified with extra Plexiglas and bars. Throughout the region, merchants readied to defend themselves as if {{on the eve of}} a war. College student Elizabeth Hwang spoke of the attacks on her parents' convenience store in 1992 and the fact that if trouble erupted following the 1993 trial, that they were armed with a Glock 17 pistol, a Beretta and a shotgun and they planned to barricade themselves in their store to fight off looters.|$|E
25|$|Many {{officers}} in the Indian army believed revolt was possible, and they <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst.</b> In Amritsar, more than 15,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh. The British Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab, Michael O'Dwyer, {{is said to have}} believed that these were the early and ill-concealed signs of a conspiracy for a coordinated revolt around May, at a time when British troops would have withdrawn to the hills for the summer. The Amritsar massacre, as well as responses preceding and succeeding it, have been described by some historians as the end result of a concerted plan of response from the Punjab administration to suppress such a conspiracy. James Houssemayne Du Boulay is said to have ascribed a direct relationship between the fear of a Ghadarite uprising {{in the midst of an}} increasingly tense situation in Punjab, and the British response that ended in the massacre.|$|E

500|$|Hurricane {{warnings}} were {{in effect}} from the Virginia Capes to Morehead, North Carolina and a Hurricane alert was issued northward to Atlantic City, New Jersey. Dump trucks loaded with dirt {{were ready to}} make earthen dikes around the Riegel paper mill, due to the severe damage caused to it by hurricanes earlier that year which caused the 1955 Delaware River flood. Recent flooding, from Hurricane Diane, along the Delaware River kept residents along its banks alert should the storm strike, business owners were also ready to move their merchandise if the need arose. New York City officials <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst,</b> with police officers filling gas tanks of their patrol cars and extra patrol men being called to duty {{in advance of the}} hurricane. [...] Flights were canceled in New York, firemen stood at the ready in Staten Island, and the Coast Guard warned shipping companies of the impending storm. [...] A boxing match between Rocky Marciano and Archie Moore was delayed, which allowed the promoters to sell an additional $150,000 (1955) in tickets, which is $ in present-day figures.|$|E

2500|$|Aung San was to {{all intents}} and {{purposes}} Prime Minister, although he was still subject to a British veto. On 27 January 1947, Aung San and the British Prime Minister Clement Attlee signed an agreement in London guaranteeing Burma's independence within a year; Aung San had been responsible for its negotiation. At a press conference during a stopover in Delhi, he stated that the Burmese wanted [...] "complete independence" [...] and not dominion status, and that they had [...] "no inhibitions of any kind" [...] about [...] "contemplating a violent or non-violent struggle or both" [...] in order to achieve it. He concluded that he hoped for the best, but was <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst.</b>|$|E

2500|$|By {{the time}} of the convention, city {{officials}} were <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst,</b> with 23,000 police, National Guard, and Federal troops. Following the pig's nomination on the first day, Rubin and 6 others were arrested, but protests and music concerts were allowed to continue in Lincoln Park for two days, albeit an 11:00 PM curfew was enforced. On the Convention's second night, poet Allan Ginsberg led protesters out of the park, thus avoiding confrontation, by chanting [...] "Om". On the third night, riots erupted in response to the curfew, causing police to indiscriminately attack protesters and innocent bystanders alike, including journalists from around the world and even visiting dignitaries, throughout the streets of Chicago. [...] The violence suffered by the journalists present, even including Mike Wallace, Dan Rather and Hugh Hefner, resulted in a mainstream media that was more sympathetic to certain hippie ideals, and less so to politicians, for several years. However, this galvanized the protest movement, and the following year, the trial of Hoffman, Rubin, and others as the [...] "Chicago Seven" [...] (originally Eight) generated significant interest.|$|E
