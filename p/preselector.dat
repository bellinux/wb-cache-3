25|$|The {{company was}} awarded a Royal Warrant to provide cars to the British Monarch in 1902; it lost this {{privilege}} in the 1950s after being supplanted by Rolls-Royce. The company occasionally used alternative technology: the Knight engine which it partially developed {{in the early twentieth}} century and used from 1909 to 1935, worm gear final drive fitted from 1909 until after the Second World War, and the Wilson <b>preselector</b> gearbox used from 1930 to the mid-1950s.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 1946 season Gerard {{decided to}} equip {{himself with a}} more potent mount. While both Bob and Joan Gerard {{continued}} to use R4A for a string of hillclimbing and sprint victories, newly purchased ERA R14B was rebuilt and modified for circuit racing. Gerard's major changes to the pre-war design were to fit a <b>preselector</b> gearbox and to change the Zoller-type supercharger for a smaller, but more efficient Murray-Jamieson design. He also later changed the car's outward appearance, switching the old-fashioned upright radiator to one with a far more raked cowl, lowering the bonnet line to accommodate this.|$|E
25|$|The 2600s {{shared the}} engines and {{transmission}} of their GNR(I) predecessors, having two , 9.6-litre, six-cylinder, four-stroke engines driving the inner axles {{of the two}} bogies via fluid flywheels and Self-Changing Gears five-speed <b>preselector</b> gearboxes, with cardan shafts driving forward/reverse gearboxes {{on the ends of}} the axles. Multiple working was via 24-core jumper cables. The cars were fitted with two parallel vacuum brake systems—a conventional system and a second high-vacuum, quick-release system, based on reservoirs in which a vacuum was continually maintained, for use on services with frequent stops. Steam heating was originally fitted; even-numbered cars had a boiler in the guard's compartment, capable of supplying steam for up to four cars. Cars used on suburban services were subsequently fitted with a bus-type heating system that utilised the engines' cooling water.|$|E

25|$|The PS2 {{followed}} the PD2 Titan in having the 125bhp 9.8-litre O600 engine {{and a new}} synchromesh gearbox. With changes to rules on width and length there were numerous {{different versions of the}} home market PS2 based on permutations of width and length, whether built with or without a rear dropped frame and whether reconstructed from short-wheelbase chassis or built new to the longer wheelbase. PS2/1, 3, 5 and 7 had a 17ft 6in wheelbase for 27ft 6in bodywork. PS2/10, 11, 12, 12A, 13, 13A, 14 and 15 had a longer wheelbase of 18ft 9in for 30ft long coachwork (but see later about the six-wheel PS2/10 and /11). The entire home market Tiger range was vacuum-braked and PS2s for the UK had the synchromesh gearbox only, whilst the Titan PD2 had a number of options including constant-mesh, AEC <b>preselector</b> and Pneumocyclic. The last new PS2 coaches entered service in 1953 with West Riding Automobile Company, and the last home-market customer for the Tiger PS2 bus was the Burnley, Colne and Nelson Joint Transport Committee, their last arrived in 1955 and put in 20 years and more of work, thus being the last half-cab single deckers on normal service in the UK.|$|E
500|$|In 1905, {{with his}} golfing friend H.C.B. Underdown, {{he became one}} of the two first {{directors}} of Commercial Cars Limited (Commer) which the pair of them set up to make Commer commercial vehicles. [...] Their venture was intended to capitalize on a promising <b>preselector</b> gearbox invented for heavy vehicles. He remained on that board until his death.|$|E
2500|$|A car enthusiast {{since the}} age of four, he owned a {{succession}} of interesting machines ranging from a Fiat Topolino, several Lancias, a Hispano-Suiza, a <b>preselector</b> gearbox Delage, and a special-bodied Jowett Jupiter. He made records like Phoney Folklore that included the song of the Russian peasant [...] "whose tractor had betrayed him" [...] and his [...] "Grand Prix of Gibraltar" [...] was a vehicle for his creative wit and ability at car-engine sound effects and voices.|$|E
5000|$|In winning {{preselection}}, O'Dwyer {{became the}} first woman to win Liberal Party preselection for a safe seat in metropolitan Melbourne. During the preselection process federal Liberal politicians Sophie Mirabella, Fran Bailey and Helen Coonan claimed {{that there had been a}} sexist campaign against O'Dwyer's candidacy, with some <b>preselectors</b> being told that a [...] "leadership seat" [...] such as Higgins was unsuited to a woman and that being elected to a federal seat might endanger her marriage.|$|R
50|$|Markham {{received}} a late endorsement from Premier Bob Carr {{ahead of the}} 2002 preselection vote, {{but this was not}} enough to sway the right-dominated <b>preselectors,</b> who voted for Noreen Hay, a local left faction figure who defected to the right soon after. He retired at the election rather than run as an independent, and Hay held the seat, albeit with a 13% swing against her. Tickets to his farewell dinner at the WIN Entertainment Centre sold out five days before it was held.|$|R
5000|$|The beacons {{that are}} between 510 kHz and 530 kHz can {{sometimes}} be heard on AM radios that can tune below {{the beginning of the}} Medium Wave(MW) broadcast band. Frequencies close to the MW band, like 515 kHz, may be within the receive bandwidth of some AM radios. However, reception of NDBs generally requires a radio receiver that can receive frequencies below 530 kHz (the longwave band). A NDB in Miramichi, New Brunswick once operated at 530 kHz as [...] "F9" [...] but had later moved to 520 kHz. Most so-called [...] "shortwave" [...] radios also include mediumwave and longwave, and they can usually receive all frequencies from 150 kHz to 30 MHz, which makes them ideal for listening to NDBs. Whilst this type of receiver is adequate for reception of local beacons, specialized techniques (receiver <b>preselectors,</b> noise limiters and filters) are required for the reception of very weak signals from remote beacons.|$|R
2500|$|By November 1933 the {{combination}} of fluid flywheel and Wilson <b>preselector</b> gearbox was used in all Daimler vehicles, [...] "ranging from 10h.p. passenger cars to double-deck omnibuses" [...] according to the chairman's report to the shareholders at their Annual General Meeting that month. According to the same report, [...] "more than 11,000 vehicles" [...] were using the transmission by that time. Daimler would continue to develop and use these transmissions until 1956, when Borg-Warner fully automatic units were offered initially as an alternative but later as standard.|$|E
50|$|Tunable antenna preamplifiers (preamps) often {{incorporate}} a front-end <b>preselector</b> circuit {{to improve their}} performance. The integrated device is both a preamplifier and a <b>preselector,</b> and either name is correct. This ambiguity sometimes leads to confusion. A passive <b>preselector</b> has no power and no internal amplifier, and typically works quite well with modern receivers, with negligible signal-loss. Further, receivers and preamps get no benefit from a <b>preselector</b> if they are fed from a narrow-band source, such as a small loop antenna.|$|E
50|$|For lowest loss (and widest bandwidth), the <b>preselector</b> is tuned {{using the}} lowest {{inductance}} and highest capacitance (and the lowest , or least selectivity) for the desired frequency. The wider bandwidth allows interference through from more nearby frequencies, but reduces {{the need to}} retune the <b>preselector</b> while tuning the receiver, since any one low-inductance setting for the <b>preselector</b> will pass many nearby frequencies.|$|E
50|$|A <b>preselector</b> {{typically}} is {{tuned to}} have a narrow bandwidth, centered on the receiver’s operating frequency. The <b>preselector</b> passes through the signal unchanged or only slightly reduced on the frequency that it is tuned to, but it diminishes or eliminates off-frequency signals, reducing or eliminating unwanted interference. However, a <b>preselector</b> does not remove interference on the same frequency that it and the receiver are both tuned to.|$|E
50|$|<b>Preselector</b> {{gearboxes}} are not automatic gearboxes, {{although they}} may have internal similarities. A fully automatic gearbox is able to select the ratio used; with a <b>preselector</b> gearbox, gear selection remains the driver's decision.|$|E

50|$|A <b>preselector</b> is a {{name for}} an {{electronic}} device that connects between a radio antenna and a radio receiver. The <b>preselector</b> is a band-pass filter that blocks trouble-causing out-of-tune frequencies from passing through from the antenna into the radio receiver (or preamplifier) that otherwise would be directly connected to the antenna.|$|E

5000|$|For {{the narrowest}} {{bandwidth}} (highest [...] ), the <b>preselector</b> is tuned using the highest inductance and lowest capacitance for the desired frequency, but this produces the greatest loss. It also requires retuning the <b>preselector</b> more often while searching for faint signals, {{to keep the}} preselector’s pass-through frequency closely matched to the receiver’s working frequency.|$|E
50|$|In October 1956 Daimler Conquest Century buyers {{were offered}} {{the choice of}} an {{automatic}} transmission or the traditional <b>preselector</b> system. Time was changing gear. <b>Preselector</b> gearboxes faded away as modern automatic transmissions took their place. Currency restrictions had meant that until Borg-Warner built a British plant automatic transmissions were only available on export cars.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>preselector</b> or self-changing gearbox {{is a type}} {{of manual}} gearbox (US: transmission) used on a variety of vehicles, most {{commonly}} in the 1930s. The defining characteristic of a <b>preselector</b> gearbox is that the manual shift lever is used to [...] "pre-select" [...] the next gear to be used, then a separate control (a foot pedal) is used to engage this in one single operation, without needing to work a manual clutch.|$|E
50|$|Some early {{internal}} combustion-engined railcars, both diesel and petrol, {{used the}} Wilson <b>preselector</b> gearbox. The AEC-engined GWR 'Flying Banana' railcars {{had such a}} transmission.|$|E
5000|$|The four-cylinder {{claimed a}} power output of [...] at 4,200 rpm. This was coupled through a fluid {{flywheel}} to an epicyclic <b>preselector</b> 4-speed gear box. Stopping power came from Girling mechanical brakes.|$|E
50|$|The K2 was {{the open}} 2-seater {{and so had}} the shorter chassis. It had at first the KB engine and manual box but later cars could have the larger KD with <b>preselector</b> gearbox.|$|E
50|$|A <b>preselector</b> {{improves}} {{the performance of}} nearly any receiver, but is especially helpful to receivers with broadband front-ends that are prone to overload, such as scanners and ordinary consumer-market AM broadcast and shortwave receivers.|$|E
50|$|With all preselectors {{there is}} some loss at the tuned frequency; usually, most of the loss is in the tuning coil (the ‘inductor’). Tuning the <b>preselector</b> for {{narrower}} bandwidth (or higher , or greater selectivity) increases this loss.|$|E
50|$|Although a <b>preselector</b> {{is placed}} in the same {{location}} as an antenna tuner, it serves a different purpose: An antenna tuner or “transmatch” connects two signal lines with different signal impedances and only blocks out-of-tune frequencies incidentally (if it blocks any at all).|$|E
50|$|Most preselectors have {{separate}} settings for an inductor and (at least) one capacitor. So {{with at least}} two adjustments available to tune to just one frequency, there are often a variety of settings that will tune the <b>preselector</b> to a frequency in its middle-range.|$|E
5000|$|At the 1933 Paris Salon, Delahaye {{showed the}} Superluxe, with a 3.2-litre six, {{transverse}} independent front suspension, and Cotal <b>preselector</b> or synchromesh-equipped manual transmission. It would be accompanied {{in the model}} range by a [...] four (essentially a cut-down six), and a sporting variant, the 18 Sport.|$|E
5000|$|One of the ingenious {{features}} of Dingo's design was the transmission {{which included a}} <b>preselector</b> gearbox and fluid flywheel that gave five speeds in both directions, another was a four-wheel steering system {{made possible by the}} H-drive drivetrain, giving a tight turning circle of 23 ft ...|$|E
50|$|The chassis was {{designed}} by Charles King and consisted of steel sections bolted together. The engine was connected to a four-speed <b>preselector</b> gearbox with right-hand change lever and the Girling system rod operated brakes had large 13 in drums. Half-elliptic springs provided the suspension controlled by friction dampers.|$|E
50|$|Power was {{delivered}} to the rear wheels through a Fluid flywheel transmission system, licensed under Vulcan-Sinclair and Daimler patents, that Daimler had introduced in all its vehicles {{at the beginning of}} the decade. The epicyclic <b>preselector</b> gearbox allowed a clear flat floor for driver and front seat passenger.|$|E
