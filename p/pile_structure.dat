40|$|A {{method of}} {{predicting}} equilibrium scour depths around multiple <b>pile</b> <b>structures</b> based on pre-scoured bottom shear stress {{was developed in}} this study. It was hypothesized that a relationship exists between the pre-scoured bottom shear stress and the equilibrium scour depth. A series of hydrodynamic tests were conducted in which near-bottom flow measurements {{were made in the}} vicinity of a variety of multiple <b>pile</b> <b>structures.</b> The distribution of bottom shear stress was estimated from these flow measurements. Scour tests were then made in the same flume using the same structures. A simple relationship between the equilibrium scour depth and the pre-scoured bottom shear stress was formulated and the data from the two sets of experiments were used to calibrate and test the formulation. The formulation gives reasonable predictions for the range of conditions tested. The approach appears promising as an alternative way of estimating equilibrium local scour depths for complex multiple <b>pile</b> <b>structures.</b> In addition, a number of interesting and useful findings were made regarding the rate at which a local scour hole forms near complex structures.

40|$|Tunnelling beneath <b>piled</b> <b>structures</b> may {{compromise}} {{the stability and}} serviceability of the structure. The assessment of potential structure damage is a problem being faced by engineers across the globe. This paper presents the outcomes {{of a series of}} geotechnical centrifuge experiments designed to simulate the effect of excavating a tunnel beneath <b>piled</b> <b>structures.</b> The stiffness and weight effects of <b>piled</b> <b>structures</b> are examined independently using aluminium plates of varying stiffness (`equivalent beam' approach) and the addition of weights supporteby aluminium piles. Greenfeld displacement patterns and results from pile loading tests are also provided. The variation of structure displacement profiles with plate stiffness, weight, and tunnel volume loss are used to illustrate the main effects of tunnel-pile interaction and the contribution of the superstructure to the global tunnel-pile-structure interaction. Results indicate that piles have a detrimental role in tunnel-structure interaction problems, whereas the superstructure stiffness and weight can, respectively, reduce and increase structure distor-tions and settlements. Finally, the potential for structural damage is evaluated by comparing structure and greenfield deflection ratios as well as resulting modification factors. The paper presents a unique set of results and insights which provide valuable guidance to engineers working across the ground and structural engineering disciplines...|$|R

50|$|Sylvia is {{very dark}} {{in color and}} {{probably}} has a very primitive composition. The discovery of its moons made possible an accurate measurement of the asteroid's mass and density. Its density {{was found to be}} very low (around 1.2 times the density of water), indicating that the asteroid is porous to very porous; from 25% to as much as 60% of it may be empty space, depending on the details of its composition. However, the mineralogy of the X-type asteroids is not known well enough to constrain this further. Either way, this suggests a loose rubble <b>pile</b> <b>structure.</b> Sylvia is also a fairly fast rotator, turning about its axis every 5.18 hours (giving an equatorial rotation velocity of about 230 km/h or 145 mph). The short axis is the rotation axis. Direct images indicate that Sylvia's pole points towards ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (+62.6°, 72.4°) with only a 0.5° uncertainty, which gives it an axial tilt of around 29.1°. Sylvia's shape is strongly elongated.|$|E
