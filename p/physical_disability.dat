40|$|BACKGROUND: Studies {{suggest that}} women with disabilities {{experience}} health and health care disparities before, during, and after pregnancy. However, existing perinatal health and health care frameworks do not address the needs and barriers faced by women with <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities</b> {{around the time of}} pregnancy. A new framework that addresses perinatal disparities among women with <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities</b> is needed. OBJECTIVE: To propose a framework for examining perinatal health and health care disparities among women with <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities.</b> METHODS: We developed a perinatal health framework guided by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and the integrated perinatal health framework by Misra et al. RESULTS: The proposed framework uses a life span perspective in a manner that directly addresses the multiple determinants specific to women with <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities</b> around the time of pregnancy. The framework is based on longitudinal and integrated perspectives that take into account women 2 ̆ 7 s functional status and environment over their life course. CONCLUSION: The perinatal health framework for women with <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities</b> was developed to inform the way researchers and health care professionals address disparities in perinatal health and health care among women with <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities...</b>|$|R
5|$|Ice sledge {{hockey is}} open only to male {{competitors}} with a <b>physical</b> <b>disability</b> {{in the lower}} part of their body. The game is played using international hockey rules with some modifications. Athletes sit on sledges with two blades that allow the puck to go beneath the sledge. They also use two sticks, which have a spike-end for pushing and a blade-end for shooting. The athletes are classified into three groups: group 1 is for athletes with no sitting balance or with major impairment in both upper and lower limbs, group 2 is for athletes with some sitting balance and moderate impairment in their extremities and athletes in group 3 have good balance and mild impairment in their upper and lower limbs.|$|E

Mary Jane Potterton (c.1837– 1873) had been born at Evington, Leicestershire, her father being William Potterton, who was {{described}} as an agricultural labourer in the 1851 census of Thurmaston, Leicestershire.

5|$|Every {{participant}} at the Paralympics {{has their}} disability grouped {{into one of}} five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any <b>physical</b> <b>disability</b> that does not fall strictly {{under one of the}} other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.|$|E
40|$|Children with <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities</b> {{typically}} {{participate in}} physical {{activities that are}} aligned with their function. As a result, children with <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities</b> engage in solitary activities more often, leaving little room to practice age appropriate social behaviors during physical activity with peers (Livingston et al, 2011). Emerging literature supports the prescription of participation-based physical therapy for children with <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities</b> to achieve certain goals, such as improving motor skills (Palisano et al, 2012). Motor skill proficiency is strongly correlated with a child’s physical activity (PA) level and children with <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities</b> are less physically active compared to typically developing children (Maher et al, 2007). Participation-based therapy assumes that physical therapists support social environments to achieve a child’s personal goals. However, relations between social behaviors and motor skills during physical activities have been underexplored. The purpose of this investigation is to examine relations of social behaviors and FMS performance during PA in children with <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities</b> {{in order to further}} guide and support participation-based therapy methods...|$|R

40|$|It is {{important}} to capture perceptions and experiences of people with <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities</b> about HIV/AIDS, because it may help service providers to understand the effects of HIV/AIDS on individuals with <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities,</b> their households and communities. People with <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities</b> may be a strategic group to engage in HIV/AIDS prevention strategies, lobbing and advocacy. The researcher conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 participants including students and staff with <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities</b> with the Disability Unit of the University of Witwatersrand. The {{results of the study}} show that people with <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities</b> have the perception that they are among the worst hit groups of people and who have received less focus for awareness, protection and prevention programmes. They believe that this adds to the already harrowing problems of discrimination and vulnerability that exacerbate the risk of contracting HIV/ AIDS. The stigmatization and discrimination have impacted negatively on their self confidence and personal pride, which in turn has an effect on their interpersonal relationships. They perceive services relating to HIV/AIDS as being not easily accessible to them, due to distance from lecture halls and students hostels, infrastructural barriers as well as lack of skills by service providers to specifically handle people with <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Recommendations include improving capacity of service delivery by providing adaptable infrastructure, additional structured services for people with disabilities, awareness campaigns, in-house or additional training specifically on handling people with <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities</b> for Campus Health and Wellness Clinics, other services providers and staff members...|$|R

One day, while trying to escape some bullies chasing him, his braces fall off revealing the young Forrest {{to be a very}} fast runner. Despite his low intelligence quotient, Forrest's new running ability leads to him receiving a football scholarship to the University of Alabama in the early 1960s, becoming a top running back, being named on the All-American team, and meeting President John F. Kennedy. After his college graduation, he enlists in the US Army, where he befriends a fellow soldier named Bubba, who convinces Forrest to go into the shrimping business with him when the war is over. In 1967, they are sent to Vietnam and, during an ambush, Bubba is killed in action. Forrest saves many of his platoon, including his Lieutenant, Dan Taylor, who loses both his legs. Forrest is awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To explore {{relations}} of fatigue, <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities,</b> and depression {{in patients with}} multiple sclerosis (MS) cross-sectionally and over time. Methods: Ninety-eight MS patients were interviewed twice at an interval of a year. Relationships of physical and mental fatigue, and reduced activity and motivation with depression and <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities</b> were established cross-sectionally by regression analyses and longitudinally by structural equation modelling. Results: Cross-sectionally, physical fatigue was related with <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities,</b> and mental fatigue was associated with depression. Prospectively, physical fatigue was a predictor of the <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities</b> of a year later. The reverse relationship of <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities</b> predicting the <b>physical</b> fatigue of one year later was, however, not significant, while depression predicted this physical fatigue and reduced activity of a year later. Depression did not predict the later mental fatigue nor was depression predicted by preceding fatigue experiences. Conclusions: Fatigue in MS should be studied over time as relationships of fatigue with {{physical and mental health}} change {{during the course of a}} year. Moreover, differentiating in fatigue experiences sheds light on the relationship of fatigue with physical and mental health. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
