40|$|A human {{movement}} as a response of something is always different for each individual. However, the response {{is often difficult to}} measure because it is very flexible and sometimes are very subjective. Research was conducted with the goal to design and create tools measure the response speed of human-based mikrokontroller AT 89 S 8252 and determine the level of accuracy tool. Measu rement tool consists of 4 switch, ie, 2, and for tester 2 for participants who tested, 2 indicator LED, buzzer, 4 buttons (menu, enter, select and cancel), speaker, and MK AT 89 S 8252. LCD as a display. For the data on the motor response and eye response, motor ears done 9 times as much for each individual. Before the test on the motor response, eye and ear motor is done, first time on the tool dikalibrasikan using the time on the stopwatch 1 / 1000. After that the process of testing carried out by determining the response to be conducted, the examiner pressing switch S 1 or S 2 switch, then LED 1 or LED 2 akan buzzer or light simultaneously. Participants must be tested first with a quick switch <b>press</b> <b>switch</b> S 3 or S 4 to stop the buzzer and the process of calculation. Step response of the data on the eyes and ears are the same. In the process of calibration equipment with time using the stopwatch 1 / 1000 data obtained 9. The relative error deviation of 2. 5 % was obtained, the accuracy produced by means of measuring the speed of human response, 97. 5 %. Boundary condition is the human response that is the limit of 3 is very good (one limit), normal / good (limit two), poor (limit three). In the testing of motor response in humans that use LED indicator, the data better than a motor ear response data, is due to the rapid Rambat different. LED light will reach the human eye without the lapse of time, but the sound or the sound will reach the human ear after the time interval...|$|E

50|$|Switches come in {{a variety}} of shapes and sizes {{depending}} on the action used to activate them (such as sip-puff, pushing, pulling, pressing, blinking or squeezing). Switches also vary in their colour and aesthetics. For push or <b>press</b> <b>switches,</b> the amount of force required to operate them varies or in some cases can be adjusted. Some switches may only require a touch (not even a press), some may be designed to be kicked. A switch can be operated by almost any body part that is able to produce consistent and voluntary movement..|$|R

Like the closure of TV-6 the year before, the regularly scheduled programming was suddenly interrupted by a brief announcement that the channel was [...] "taken off the air" [...] before switching to a testcard. It was widely speculated in the press that such a hurried closure was performed to prevent the final broadcast of Evgeny Kiselyov's [...] "Itogi" [...] show, the only remaining opposition political broadcast at the time.

50|$|Much of the game's dungeons and overworld {{are filled}} with monsters, mostly creatures from fantasy and mythology like ogres, skeletons, ghosts, golems, and more; many may be avoided or killed for gold or other collectables, while others must be killed to advance the plot and the game. Many traps, and puzzles also appear {{requiring}} the player to jump from platform to platform <b>press</b> <b>switches</b> and move blocks to climb on. Locked doors inhibit the player's progress, the player must find keys or beat enemies or puzzles to unlock them and progress further. Many dungeons and areas have a boss to defeat at the end. The monsters, puzzles and dungeons increase in difficulty as the game progresses. The player has health which is kept track of by hearts; health and the maximum health limit may be increased with items purchased in towns or found in dungeons. The player is not prevented from revisiting old towns and dungeons, and is frequently {{required to do so}} to advance the plot.|$|R

5000|$|The player {{controls}} a small stick-like {{figure who}} can walk, {{go up and}} down stairs, and <b>press</b> <b>switches.</b> The object of each level in the game is to move this stick figure from the entrance door to the exit door. There are multiple obstacles that the player must overcome to get to the exit door, including moving platforms, spiked blocks, and pressure-sensitive bridges. The player is given a set amount of time to traverse the level, but each level is set up to be impossible to complete in just one playthrough. This is how time bounces come into play. Each time the player moves through the level a recording of their actions is created. When time bounces, the player plays through the same level again, but alongside the recording of what they did in the previous playthrough. This recording is known as an [...] "echo" [...] and appears as a shadow of the player. By cooperating with these echoes of the players past actions, the player can successfully {{get to the end of}} the level.|$|R

The player must indicate a direction, then <b>press</b> the <b>switch</b> in order to shoot. The movement joystick is also set so that a considerable time delay exists before the new direction takes effect on screen. These controls allow the sheriff to walk in one direction while shooting in another.|$|R

25|$|In September 1971, the {{decision}} was made to commence work on the tunnel. A Shinkansen-capable cross section was selected, with plans to extend the Shinkansen network. Arduous construction in difficult geological conditions proceeded. 34 workers were killed during construction. On 27 January 1983, Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone <b>pressed</b> a <b>switch</b> that set off a blast that completed the pilot tunnel.

40|$|Ten {{subjects}} {{participated in}} an experiment in which each was presented with series of paired stimuli separated by 1000 msec. The first stimulus was a click. The second stimulus was either of two visual patterns, concentric circles or a star figure. Figure selection on each trial was determined by a random procedure. There were four experimental conditions: 1) Subjects <b>pressed</b> a <b>switch</b> following the presentation of either figure. 2) Subjects <b>pressed</b> a <b>switch</b> following {{the presentation of the}} star only. 3) Subjects guessed prior to the clicks, which figure would appear as S 2; no overt motor response was required. 4) Subjects had to add 7 to a cumulative sum following a star, and subtract 7 following the circles; no overt motor response was required. Using data obtained from a vertex to linked ear derivation we conclude that the CNV is not contingent on a motor response to S 2. The electrical potentials recorded following S 2, and in particular the positive-going “resolution” of the CNV seemed to vary systematically with the experimental conditions. An application of Tucker 2 ̆ 7 s three-mode factor analysis to this CNV is reported...|$|R
5000|$|Chaucer's {{works were}} {{originally}} printed in blackletter, but most <b>presses</b> were <b>switched</b> over to Roman type around 1590, following {{the trend of}} the Renaissance. Horace Walpole wrote in 1781 that [...] "I am too, though a Goth, so modern a Goth that I hate the black letter, and I love Chaucer better in Dryden and Baskerville than in his own language and dress". The final uses of blackletter in the 17th century were for printing ballads, chivalric romances, and jokebooks.|$|R
