5|$|Able and Baker are {{the first}} two letters of the Joint Army/Navy <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Alphabet,</b> used from 1941 until 1956. Alpha and Bravo are their {{counterparts}} in the current NATO <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabet.</b> Charlie is the third letter in both systems. According to eyewitness accounts, the time of detonation for each test was announced as H or How hour; in the official JTF-1 history, the term M or Mike hour is used instead.|$|E

50|$|The IPA {{and many}} other <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabets</b> use two systems to {{indicate}} tone: a diacritic system and an adscript system. In the diacritic system, the double acute represents an extra high tone.|$|R
50|$|The script {{remained}} unchallenged {{until the}} 1820s, {{when there were}} several attempts to replace them with <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabets.</b> The two most famous attempts were made by Peter Dajnko (Dajnko alphabet) in 1824 and Fran Metelko (Metelko alphabet) in 1825.|$|R
5|$|Extensions to the International <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Alphabet</b> for speech {{pathology}} {{were created}} in 1990 and officially adopted by the International Clinical Phonetics and Linguistics Association in 1994.|$|E
5|$|The name King was {{not used}} again after the season, {{although}} {{it was on the}} naming list for 1951 and 1952 due to being part of the Joint Army/Navy <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Alphabet.</b> The <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Alphabet</b> was decommissioned in 1953 in favor of using female names. Based on population growth in south Florida, it is estimated that a storm identical to Hurricane King would cause $2.8billion in insured damage if it struck in 2001, with the total roughly split between Broward and Miami-Dade counties.|$|E

2500|$|Linguists use letter {{frequency}} analysis as a rudimentary technique for language identification, where it's particularly effective {{as an indication}} of whether an unknown writing system is alphabetic, syllablic, or ideographic. [...] For example, the Japanese Hiragana syllabary contains 46 distinct characters, which is more than most <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabets,</b> e.g. the Hawaiian alphabet which has a mere 13 letters, or English which has 26.|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} {{represent}} {{the sounds of the}} world's languages in writing, linguists have developed the International <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Alphabet,</b> designed to represent all of the discrete sounds that are known to contribute to meaning in human languages.|$|E
5|$|The 1952 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the last}} Atlantic {{hurricane season}} to name tropical cyclones using the <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabet.</b> It was a near normal Atlantic hurricane season, although it was the least active since 1946. The season officially started on June15; however, a pre-season unnamed storm formed on Groundhog Day, becoming the only storm on record {{in the month of}} February. The other six tropical cyclones were named using the Joint Army/Navy <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Alphabet,</b> the first of which formed on August18. The final storm of the season dissipated on October28, {{two and a half weeks}} before the season officially ended on November15.|$|E
5|$|The {{table of}} consonants uses symbols from the modern orthography with the {{corresponding}} symbol in the International <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Alphabet</b> (IPA) following {{where the two}} vary, or {{to draw attention to}} a particular property of the sound in question.|$|E
50|$|The tie is {{a symbol}} {{in the shape of}} an arc similar to a large breve, used in Greek, <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabets,</b> and Z notation. It can be used between two {{characters}} with spacing as punctuation, or non-spacing as a diacritic. It can be above or below, and reversed. Its forms are called tie, double breve, enotikon or papyrological hyphen, ligature tie, and undertie.|$|R
40|$|Recently, neural sequence-to-sequence (Seq 2 Seq) {{models have}} been applied {{to the problem of}} grapheme-to-phoneme (G 2 P) conversion. These models offer a {{straightforward}} way of modeling the conversion by jointly learning the alignment and translation of input to output tokens in an end-to-end fashion. However, until now this approach did not show improved error rates on its own compared to traditional joint-sequence based n-gram models for G 2 P. In this paper, we investigate how multitask learning can improve the performance of Seq 2 Seq G 2 P models. A single Seq 2 Seq model is trained on multiple phoneme lexicon datasets containing multiple languages and <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabets.</b> Although multi-language learning does not show improved error rates, combining standard datasets and crawled data with different <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabets</b> of the same language shows promising error reductions on English and German Seq 2 Seq G 2 P conversion. Finally, combining Seq 2 seq G 2 P models with standard n-grams based models yields significant improvements over using either model alone...|$|R
5000|$|Prior to {{spelling}} alphabets, {{the words}} used to indicate English letters were [...] "a", [...] "bee", [...] "cee", [...] "dee", [...] "e", etc. Their spoken sounds {{are difficult to}} discriminate, particularly over a limited-bandwidth and noisy communications channel, hence the use by armed services of unambiguous <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabets</b> for electrical voice communication (telephone and radio, but not telegraph). Confusion between letters may not be problematical in some circumstances but, particularly in some military contexts, it can have lethal consequences.|$|R
5|$|The tables below {{list the}} consonants (Q. ólamar) and vowels of late colloquial Noldorin Quenya, i.e. Quenya as spoken among the Exiled Noldor in Middle-earth. They are written using the International <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Alphabet,</b> unless {{otherwise}} noted.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa has {{seventeen}} consonants {{and seven}} oral vowels; {{there are also}} long nasal vowels whose phonological status is unclear. In this article, Ottawa words are written in the modern orthography described below, with phonetic transcriptions in brackets using the International <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Alphabet</b> (IPA) as needed.|$|E
5|$|Since 2002, {{subtropical}} storms {{have been}} assigned names from the same naming sequence as tropical storms. Nicole was the first named subtropical storm since the policy change to not achieve full tropical cyclone status. In 1972 and 1973, four subtropical storms were named using the <b>Phonetic</b> <b>alphabet,</b> while all other subtropical cyclones remained unnamed.|$|E

5000|$|Hypergraphy merges poetry (text) {{with more}} visual (graphic) ways of {{communication}} such as painting, illustration or signs. The technique was first known as 'metagraphics', but later {{became known as}} 'hypergraphics'. Maurice Lemaître, a Lettrist theorist, defined it as communicating through the union of various forms of communication, as an [...] "ensemble of signs capable of transmitting the reality served by the consciousness more exactly than all the former fragmentary and partial practices (<b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabets,</b> algebra, geometry, painting, music, and so forth)." ...|$|R
5000|$|The ITU {{adopted the}} International Maritime Organization's <b>phonetic</b> {{spelling}} <b>alphabet</b> in 1959, and in 1969 specified {{that it be}} [...] "for application in the maritime mobile service only".|$|R
5|$|The 1972 {{hurricane}} season {{was the first}} year in which quasi-tropical cyclones were named, by using the NATO <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabet.</b> At the time, the names were applied to large subtropical cyclones and small neutercanes, {{both of which were}} later combined into one category.|$|E
5|$|The IPA is {{designed}} to represent only those qualities of speech {{that are part of}} oral language: phones, phonemes, intonation and the separation of words and syllables. To represent additional qualities of speech, such as tooth gnashing, lisping, and sounds made with a cleft lip and cleft palate, an extended set of symbols, the extensions to the International <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Alphabet,</b> may be used.|$|E
5|$|The International <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Alphabet</b> (IPA) is an {{alphabetic}} {{system of}} phonetic notation {{based primarily on}} the Latin alphabet. It was devised by the International Phonetic Association in the late 19th century as a standardized representation of the sounds of spoken language. The IPA is used by lexicographers, foreign language students and teachers, linguists, speech-language pathologists, singers, actors, constructed language creators and translators.|$|E

50|$|The letter thorn {{was used}} for writing Old English very early on, as was ð; unlike ð, thorn {{remained}} in common use {{through most of the}} Middle English period. Both letters were used for the phoneme /θ/, sometimes by the same scribe. This sound was regularly realised in Old English as the voiced fricative ð between voiced sounds, but either letter could be used to write it; the modern use of ð in <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabets</b> {{is not the same as}} the Old English orthographic use. A thorn with the ascender crossed (Ꝥ) was a popular abbreviation for the word that.|$|R
50|$|Persian Sign Language is {{the sign}} {{language}} used by Deaf and hard-of-hearing people in Iran. It {{is a true}} sign language, unlike the Baghcheban <b>phonetic</b> hand <b>alphabet,</b> which {{is a form of}} cued speech.|$|R
5|$|The Jacksonville {{hurricane}} warning office moved to Miami, Florida in 1943. Tropical cyclone naming began for Atlantic tropical cyclones using the Joint Army/Navy <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Alphabet</b> by 1947. In 1950, the Miami Hurricane Warning Office began {{to prepare the}} annual hurricane season summary articles. In the 1953 Atlantic season, the United States Weather Bureau began naming storms which reach tropical storm intensity with human names.|$|E
5|$|From 1950 through 1952, {{names from}} the Joint Army/Navy <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Alphabet</b> were first used for storms in the North Atlantic. Able {{is the first}} name in the alphabet, and as such, Hurricane Able in 1950 was the first name officially {{to be used for}} an Atlantic {{hurricane}}. It was also the first of eight major hurricanes in the 1950 Atlantic hurricane season, which as of 2010 is still the record for the most major hurricanes in a season.|$|E
5|$|Potter's small format {{books have}} been {{translated}} into nearly thirty languages including Greek and Russian. The Tale of Peter Rabbit {{was the first of}} the small format books to be translated into a non-English language when Het Verhaal van Pieter Langoor was published in 1912 by Nijgh & Ditmar's Uitgevers Maatschappij, Rotterdam. Peter Rabbit has since been published in braille (1921), in the International <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Alphabet</b> (1968), and in the hieroglyphic script of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (2005).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a set of}} phonetics teaching resources as modules in a more generic framework for web-based tutoring {{in the areas of}} phonetics, multimedia communication and spoken language research. Currently the toolkit consists of standalone interactive modules and lecture notes on a number of areas of phonetics, phonology and the lexicography of spoken language. The interactive presentation includes interactive Java and CGI tools for waveform generation and display, database access, <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabets,</b> stylised articulatory <b>phonetic</b> animations with and without underlying phonological models, development and testing of syllable models, construction of web-based hyperlexica and basic techniques for visual and speech synthesis.

40|$|This article {{presents}} MLSLib, a software library for human figure animation with lip syncing. The library {{enables us to}} easily use multiple TTSs and multiple lip motion generators, and switch them arbitrarily. It also helps use of multiple speaking agents, possibly with different TTSs and lip motion generators. The MLSLib is composed of three modules: LSSAgent, TTSManager, and FCPManager; The LSSAgent module provides unified simple APIs per single agent, independent of TTSs and lip motion generators. The TTSManager and FCPManager manage TTSs and lip motion generators, respectively. Both modules support standard sets of <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabets</b> per language, and thus users are freed from TTS-dependent implementation of lip motion generators. Applications to multi-lingual agents and LOD in lip syncing are also presented...|$|R
