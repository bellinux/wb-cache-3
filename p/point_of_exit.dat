25|$|All {{components}} of the New York State Thruway system except for the Garden State Parkway Connector and the Cross-Westchester Expressway are tolled in some capacity. The New York–Ripley mainline employs both an open, barrier-based tolling system and a closed, ticket-based tolling system. From the New York City line to the NY17 exit near Harriman, there are three toll barriers. From there northward, a closed system is employed where drivers must obtain tickets which show their point of entry {{and the cost of}} traveling from there to their desired <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>exit.</b> Upon exiting the Thruway, the ticket must be surrendered and the appropriate toll must be paid. Two separate closed systems are used on the Thruway mainline, encompassing all of the mainline between Harriman and the Pennsylvania state line except for a section in and around Buffalo.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MEd) [...] PU vir CHO, 1994 Formal {{education}} {{provided by}} a school, college, technicon or university ends officially with the award of a certificate, diploma or conferral of a degree. The formal education sector must therefore make provision for a qualification structure while non-formal education normally makes provision for qualifications in vocational training which are more {{directly related to the}} requirements of a specific profession or even employer. In some cases this kind of training is concluded with the granting of a qualification which, while not of a national nature, is sometimes accepted by education authorities in other countries. The lack of a clear and well-structured nationally recognized qualification structure within the vocational training sector which can be linked to that of the formal education sector still remains a problem. A possible solution is that there should be more effective and appropriate communication between the formal and informal education sectors which, in turn, should result in mutual recognition. Clearly demarcated career tracks which are recognized nationally according to which a person can undergo vocational training, is also part of the solution. This will again stimulate further vocational training. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the viability of a system with various <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> in the South African school system and the improvement of the contact which exists between the formal and non-formal education sectors. The various theoretical <b>points</b> <b>of</b> departures which guide and sustain the relation between the formal and non-formal sectors were first determined by means of a literature survey and interviews conducted with functionaries from two vocational training institutions in the informal education sector. West-Germany and Japan were used as foreign examples to determine which <b>points</b> <b>of</b> contact existed between the formal and non-formal sectors. Various suggestions offered in the RSA with regard to the various <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> were then analyzed and evaluated. Certain conclusions were reached to determine the viability of the suggestions for the South African situation in terms of the determinants, theories and foreign experience. It was found that, based on the career profiles of the Boskop Training Centre and ISCOR, that the principle <b>of</b> multiple <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> is already being used as a linking mechanism between formal and non-formal education and training institutions. The actualization of the concept of a single education and training system existing of the formal education system as well as the vocational training sector as identifiable sub-systems operating effectively seems to be the answer to the main research question addressed by the study.

30|$|This {{article has}} {{proposed}} a design framework, EBSA, and applied it to our proposed BICM-ID techniques, SI-BICM-ID-EM, DSI-BICM-ID-EM and MDSI-BICM-ID-EM. Since EBSA {{takes into account the}} horizontal and vertical gap widths between the DemDdacc and decoder's EXIT curves at the pre-defined several MI points, it can determine the optimal labeling pattern for EM and degree allocations simultaneously. In fact, when EBSA is applied to DSI-BICM-ID-EM, two curves exactly match, and surprisingly the left-most <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the <b>EXIT</b> curve <b>of</b> DemDdacc is determined to be the (0.0, 0.0) MI point, and hence LLR exchange can not be initiated. To avoid this situation, this article introduced the MD technique, by which the left-most <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the DemDdacc <b>EXIT</b> curves can be lifted up slightly while the other part still exactly matched. As the result, very close-Shannon limit performance can be achieved without requiring heavy computational burden with ℓmap = 5 EM 4 -QAM; the complexity is almost the same level as a Turbo code with only memory- 2 constituency codes.|$|R
