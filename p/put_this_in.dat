5|$|In the {{six years}} leading up to 2013, more than 10 million {{beehives}} were lost, often to CCD, nearly twice the normal rate of loss. To <b>put</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> perspective, according to U.N. FAO data, the world's beehive stock rose from around 50 million in 1961 to around 83 million in 2014, which is about 1.3% average annual growth. Average annual growth has accelerated to 1.9% since 2009.|$|E

To <b>put</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> perspective, this would make it larger than all but four of the asteroids, after 1 Ceres, 2 Pallas, 4 Vesta, and 10 Hygiea. In spite of its relatively large size, however, lightcurve studies suggest that Hi'iaka is not a gravitationally collapsed spheroid; they further suggest that Hi'iaka is not tidally locked and has a rotation period of about 9.8 hours.|$|E

Assuming a fusion energy output equal to the 1995 global power output of about 100 EJ/yr (= 1 × 1020 J/yr) and that this does not increase in the future, which is unlikely, then the known current lithium reserves would last 3000 years. Lithium from sea water would last 60 million years, however, and a more complicated fusion process using only deuterium from sea water would have fuel for 150 billion years. To <b>put</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> context, 150 billion years is close to 30 times the remaining lifespan of the sun, and more than 10 times the estimated age of the universe.|$|E

25|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, Nuckolls {{and several other}} weapons {{designers}} had developed {{the outlines of the}} ICF approach. The D-T fuel would be placed in a small capsule, designed to rapidly ablate when heated and thereby maximize compression and shock wave formation. This capsule would be placed within an engineered shell, the hohlraum, which acted similar to the bomb casing. However, the hohlraum {{did not have to be}} heated by x-rays; any source of energy could be used as long as it delivered enough energy to cause the hohlraum itself to heat up and start giving off x-rays. Ideally the energy source would be located some distance away, to mechanically isolate both ends of the reaction. A small atomic bomb could be used as the energy source, as it is in a hydrogen bomb, but ideally smaller energy sources would be used. Using computer simulations, the teams estimated that about 5MJ of energy would be needed from the primary, generating a 1MJ beam. To <b>put</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> perspective, a small fission primary of 0.5kt releases 2 million MJ in total.|$|E

500|$|Fodor {{responds}} {{to this problem}} with what he defines as [...] "a slightly less crude causal theory". According to this approach, {{it is necessary to}} break the symmetry {{at the base of the}} crude causal theory. Fodor must find some criterion for distinguishing the occurrences of A caused by As (true) from those caused by Bs (false). The point of departure, according to Fodor, is that while the false cases are ontologically dependent on the true cases, the reverse is not true. There is an asymmetry of dependence, in other words, between the true contents (A= A) and the false ones (A = A or B). The first can subsist independently of the second, but the second can occur only because of the existence of the first:From the point of view of semantics, errors must be accidents: if in the extension of [...] "horse" [...] there are no cows, then it cannot be required for the meaning of [...] "horse" [...] that cows be called horses. On the other hand, if [...] "horse" [...] did not mean that which it means, and if it were an error for horses, it would never be possible for a cow to be called [...] "horse". Putting the two things together, it can be seen that the possibility of falsely saying [...] "this is a horse" [...] presupposes the existence of a semantic basis for saying it truly, but not vice versa. If we <b>put</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> terms of the crude causal theory, the fact that cows cause one to say [...] "horse" [...] depends on the fact that horses cause one to say [...] "horse"; but the fact that horses cause one to say [...] "horse" [...] does not depend on the fact that cows cause one to say [...] "horse"...|$|E

2500|$|To <b>put</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> perspective, {{infinite}} sets arise as filtered co{{limits of}} finite sets, infinite CABAs as filtered limits of finite power set algebras, and infinite Stone spaces as filtered limits of finite sets. Thus if one {{starts with the}} finite sets and asks how these generalize to infinite objects, there are two ways: [...] "adding" [...] them gives ordinary or inductive sets while [...] "multiplying" [...] them gives Stone spaces or profinite sets. The same choice exists for finite power set algebras as the duals of finite sets: addition yields Boolean algebras as inductive objects while multiplication yields CABAs or power set algebras as profinite objects.|$|E
2500|$|To {{balance the}} mass of carbon and produce the {{observed}} [...] value, at least 1,500 gigatons of carbon would have to degas from the mantle via volcanoes {{over the course of}} the two, 1,000 year, steps. To <b>put</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> perspective, this is about 200 times the background rate of degassing for the rest of the Paleocene. There is no indication that such a burst of volcanic activity has occurred at any point in Earth's history. However, substantial volcanism had been active in East Greenland for around the preceding million years or so, but this struggles to explain the rapidity of the PETM. Even if the bulk of the 1,500 gigatons of carbon was released in a single pulse, further feedbacks would be necessary to produce the observed isotopic excursion.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1918 the U.S. First Army {{had been}} formed, first under Pershing's direct command {{and then by}} Lieutenant General Hunter Liggett, when the U.S. Second Army under Lieutenant General Robert Bullard was created. After a quick victory at Saint-Mihiel, east of Verdun, {{some of the more}} bullish AEF commanders had hoped to push on eastwards to Metz, but this did not fit in with the plans of the Allied Supreme Commander, Marshal Foch, for three {{simultaneous}} offensives into the [...] "bulge" [...] of the Western Front (the other two being the Fourth Army's breach of the Hindenburg Line and an Anglo-Belgian offensive, led by Plumer's Second Army, in Flanders). Instead, the AEF was required to redeploy and, aided by French tanks, launched a major offensive northwards in very difficult terrain at Meuse-Argonne. Initially enjoying numerical odds of eight to one, this offensive eventually engaged 35 or 40 of the 190 or so German divisions on the Western Front, although to <b>put</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> perspective, around half the German divisions were engaged on the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) sector at the time.|$|E

2500|$|The royal courts, {{fixed to}} meet in London by the Magna Carta 1215, {{accepted}} claims for [...] "trespass on the case" [...] (more like a tort today). A jury would be called, and no wager of law was needed, but some breach of the King's peace had to be alleged. Gradually, the courts allowed claims where {{there had been no}} real trouble, no tort with [...] "force of arms" [...] (vi et armis), but it was still necessary to <b>put</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> the pleading. For instance, in 1317 one Simon de Rattlesdene alleged he was sold a tun of wine that was contaminated with salt water and, quite fictitiously, this was said to be done [...] "with force and arms, namely with swords and bows and arrows". The Court of Chancery and the King's Bench slowly started to allow claims without the fictitious allegation of force and arms from around 1350. An action for simple breach of a covenant (a solemn promise) had required production of formal proof of the agreement with a seal. However, in The Humber Ferryman's case a claim was allowed, without any documentary evidence, against a ferryman who dropped a horse overboard that he was contracted to carry across the River Humber. Despite this liberalisation, in the 1200s a threshold of 40 shillings for a dispute's value had been created. Though its importance tapered away with inflation over the years, it foreclosed court access to most people. Moreover, freedom to contract was firmly suppressed among the peasantry. After the Black Death, the Statute of Labourers 1351 prevented any increase in workers' wages fuelling, among other things, the Peasants' Revolt of 1381.|$|E
