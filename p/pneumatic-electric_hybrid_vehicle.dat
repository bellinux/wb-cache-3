40|$|Conventional {{vehicles}} tend {{to consume}} considerable amounts of fuel, which generates exhaust gases and environmental pollution during intermittent driving cycles. Therefore, prospective vehicle designs favor improved exhaust emissions and energy consumption without compromising vehicle performance. Although {{pure electric vehicles}} feature high performance and low pollution characteristics, their limitations are their short driving range and high battery costs. <b>Hybrid</b> electric <b>vehicles</b> (HEVs) are comparatively environmentally friendly and energy efficient, but cost substantially more compared with conventional <b>vehicles.</b> Hydraulic <b>hybrid</b> <b>vehicles</b> (HHVs) are mainly operated using engines, or using alternate combinations of engine and hydraulic power sources while vehicles accelerate. When the hydraulic system accumulator is depleted, the conventional engine reengages; concurrently, brake-regenerated power is recycled and reused by employing hydraulic motor–pump modules in circulation patterns to conserve fuel and recycle brake energy. This study adopted MATLAB Simulink to construct complete HHV and HEV models for backward simulations. New European Driving Cycles {{were used to determine}} the changes in fuel economy. The output of power components and the state-of-charge of energy could be retrieved.
