5000|$|In {{response}} to the controversy surrounding his casting and whether {{he should have been}} excluded from the project because of his alleged past, Howard said [...] "I hope that nothing will take away from the truly special project we all worked so hard on. I hope people enjoy it because it has been such a wonderful experience working with this cast and Fox." [...] Danny Strong admitted that he was not made aware of Howard's <b>past</b> until <b>several</b> <b>months</b> into the project. Strong said that while he did not condone Howard's alleged past behavior, [...] "it is the polar opposite of what I've experienced with him, one-on-one and on set." [...] Producer Brian Grazer put faith in Howard to [...] "do right." [...] Howard is a [...] "guy that cares a lot... and he's been great with us on our sets, so I can only speak to that," [...] Grazer continued. Fox executive Dana Walden described Howard as [...] "a great partner." [...] Walden explained that while it was the choice of the creators to hire Howard, the actor had impressed her and her co-chair Gary Newman. Walden also admitted that she and Newman were not made aware of the allegations until December 2014. By that time, Howard had been working with the network for nearly a year and showed no signs of trouble.|$|R
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the actor Robin Williams' suicide, Savage said that suicide is an [...] "aggressive act" [...] that shows no {{consideration}} for loved ones left behind. The assertion prompted criticism, but a caller to The Savage Nation said the radio host's frank talk about the subject helped him decide to not take his own life. A caller who identified himself as Joe told Savage he had been contemplating suicide for the <b>past</b> <b>several</b> <b>months,</b> and especially in the most recent week previous to the call. After Savage discovered that Joe was suffering financially, he asked his audience to join in helping Joe get {{through the rest of the}} month by donating through the Savage Legal Defense Fund. The Fund raised over $10,000 in just a few days. Another caller from Detroit had given Savage a jolt by referring to his days as a phone line crisis counselor as being predominantly dealing with suicide calls. The advice that the Detroit caller had given – [...] "you are taking a permanent solution for a temporary problem" [...] encouraged Savage to reach out to the suicidal caller he had.|$|E

This thesis will document the diplomatic means that have been utilized in vain by China’s neighbors before asking whether or not those nations which surround China may choose to form an alliance in order to offset its increasingly aggressive rise. Specifically, we will examine the challenges inherent to forming such an organization in the region and contrast our hypothetical Asian-Pacific alliance with the NATO alliance in Europe.
