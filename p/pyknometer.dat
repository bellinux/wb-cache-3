5000|$|A {{pycnometer}} (from Greek: πυκνός (puknos) meaning [...] "dense"), {{also called}} <b>pyknometer</b> or specific gravity bottle, is a device {{used to determine}} the density of a liquid. A pycnometer is usually made of glass, with a close-fitting ground glass stopper with a capillary tube through it, so that air bubbles may escape from the apparatus. This device enables a liquid's density to be measured accurately by reference to an appropriate working fluid, such as water or mercury, using an analytical balance.|$|E
30|$|For {{the density}} measurement, bicapillary <b>pyknometer</b> is used, and for {{weighing}} purposes, single pan digital balance (Citizen CY 104) is used.|$|E
40|$|The compressibilities of some {{electrolytic}} solutions at low concentrations {{have been}} determined by employing Carstensen's phase-comparison pulse method {{for measuring the}} ultrasonic velocity differences and by simultaneously measuring their densities with a Weld-type <b>pyknometer.</b> The apparent molal compressibilities φ(χ̄ 2) of NaHSO 4, KHSO 4, NaP 2 PO 4 and Na-HPO 4 have been plotted against the square root of the molarities c.

The cells were the <b>pyknometer</b> type {{with a long}} capillary barrier between the pressurising gas and {{the bulk of the}} liquid. Data, over a range of temperature from 500 to 800 K and a range of pressure to 1400 bar, were plotted in the form of isochores and used to determine densities and compressibilities of the liquids...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the theory and application of the Gilfillan-Polanyi micro- <b>pyknometer</b> technique (Gilflllan and Polanyi 1933), used for the estimation of the heavy forms of water, has been carried out. An improved technique was developed and {{the accuracy of the}} isotopic analysis of water by this method is now comparable with that obtained by routine mass-spectrometric analysis. The time required for one measurement is 50 — 60 min. The pyknometers may be calibrated by using nitrogen to change the densitv of the water in which the nvknometers float...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic studies {{provide a}} wealth of {{information}} in understanding the molecular behavior and intermolecular interaction of polymer solvent mixtures. Attempts were made to measure ultrasonic velocity, density, and viscosity for the mixture of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in acetone and dimethylformamide (DMF) of various stoichiometric ratios at 300 [*]K using crystal controlled ultrasonic interferometer (Mittal make), <b>pyknometer</b> (specific gravity bottle), and Ostwald viscometer, respectively. The acoustic parameters adiabatic compressibility (β), intermolecular free path length (Lf), acoustic impedance (Z), relative association (RA), ultrasonic attenuation (α/f 2), and relaxation time (τ) have been estimated using experimental data with well-known techniques. The variation of these acoustic parameters is explained in terms of solute-solvent molecular interaction in a polymer solution...|$|E
40|$|The partial molal {{volumes of}} nitrogen, oxygen, {{and carbon dioxide}} in water at 0 °C have been {{determined}} by a new technique based {{on the use of}} a Gilfillan-Polanyi miero- <b>pyknometer</b> as a float. The value obtained for nitrogen is 37. 0 ml and that for oxygen, 31 ml. The value for carbon dioxide is found to vary from 44 to 28 ml as the pressure at which the water is saturated with the carbon dioxide varies from 0 to 6 cm Hg. The changes in the density of water at 0 °C produced by saturation with nitrogen, oxygen, and air at 1 atm pressure are — 9 - 3, + 1 - 8, and — 4 - 7 p. p. m. respectively. The density of air-saturated water is considerably greater than would be expected from the sum of the effects due to nitrogen and oxvcen senaratelv...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{synthesis}} of copper (II) surfactants {{followed by the}} complexation of each other with the molar ratio of 1 : 2 dissolving in ethanol have been reported. The purity of the resulting complexes of the general formula-CP(PTU) (T), CP(BTA) (T) was checked by thin layer chromatography and characterized {{on the basis of}} elemental analysis. Their spectral studies are also included and data suggest that Cu (II) phenylthiourea mixed system binds through the donor ability of nitrogen to transition metal. The magnetic moment studies suggest the dimeric nature of the complexes. IR, NMR, ESR spectral details confirm that complexation has taken place successfully and dada suggest that the complexes possess elongated octahedral geometry. Density, Molar Volume, Apparent Molar Volume of these complexes was investigated in non-aqueous solvent at various concentrations by Springel <b>Pyknometer</b> to understand the nature, critical micelle concentration and micelle characteristics of the complexes. Overall, the CMC values were found to be decreased with increasing average molecular weight of soap complex. The solute - solute interactions were found to be greater before CMC whereas solute-solvent interactions were found greater after CMC...|$|E
40|$|The {{modification}} of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymer properties with irradiation {{is of interest}} as it possesses unique piezo-, pyro-, and ferroelectric properties. In this paper, we report the results of acoustic parameters of irradiated PVDF mixed with dimethylacetamide (DMAC) solution with low energy γ-source (Cs- 137). The polymer solution covered with mica film assures only γ-ray passage and the duration was increased from 18 to 50 hours to achieve the higher dose rate. The dose rate was estimated using {{the strength of the}} radioactive source and the duration of the exposure. The ultrasonic velocity (v), density (ρ), and viscosity (η) of 0. 2 [*]wt% and 0. 5 [*]wt% PVDF dissolved in pure DMAC solution, irradiated with different dose rate were measured using ultrasonic interferometer (Mittal make), <b>Pyknometer,</b> and Oswald’s viscometer, respectively. It is observed that the values of v, ρ, and η change with dose rate. The acoustic parameters such as adiabatic compressibility (β), intermolecular free path length (Lf), acoustic impedance (Z), relative association (RA), ultrasonic attenuation (α/f 2), and relaxation time (τ) are calculated using the experimental data. These results are interpreted in terms of the solute-solvent interaction in a polymer solution and scissoring chain damage...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} function of glycine is as {{a precursor to}} proteins. It is also a building block to numerous natural products. The measurements of density, viscosity and sound speed have been determined by experimental procedures using bicapillary <b>pyknometer,</b> Ostwald’s viscometer and Ultrasonic interferometer respectively. The experimental data related to density, viscosity, sound speed for the system as Glycine+Urea(aq) +KBr(aq) are further utilized to derive parameters viz. adiabatic compressibility(β), apparent molal volume(Φv), apparent molal compressibility(Φk), Intermolecular free length(Lf), Specific acoustic impedance(Z), internal pressure(Πi), Solvation number(Sn), relative association(RA), ultrasonic attenuation(α/f 2). From these derived parameters we calculate limiting apparent molal volume(фv °), limiting apparent molal compressibility(фk °) and experimental slope(Sv * and Sk *) by using Masson’s equation. The viscosity data are analyzed using Jones-Dole equation. The concentration range selected for Glycine is 0. 10 m to 1. 2 m. The measurements are conducted at three temperatures viz. 298, 308, 318 K. The constancy of temperature is maintained {{by the use of}} refrigerated bath with water as circulating medium. The results are interpreted on the basis of solute-solvent and solute-solute interactions where the addition of solute and its concentration produces a major discrepancy on the interactions which evinces that interactions are a function of the concentration...|$|E
40|$|Recently, several papers {{investigated}} the linear dimensional changes in dentine after air-drying. This paper pertains to weight changes, volume changes, and density changes caused by air-drying {{of sound and}} demineralized intact dentine. The densities of sound and artificially demineralized human coronal dentine were measured in the wet state and after various drying periods of up to 24 h. The volume was assessed either {{by means of a}} <b>pyknometer</b> (wet samples) or by means of dimension measurements. The air-drying experiments were done using a Mettler thermobalance at room temperature. The density of wet sound coronal dentine was found to be 2. 24 +/- 0. 12 g. cm(- 3); the value of wet demineralized dentine was about 1. 6 g. cm(- 3). The data show that previously published density values of powdered sound dentine may have been influenced by powdering effects, air-drying, and air inclusion. In whole demineralized air-dried dentine, air inclusion can be very severe: up to 30 % by volume. The results show furthermore that in demineralized dentine we have two drying stages: during the first one (up to about 10 min of air-drying), the lesions shrink about 23 %, while a main part of the water in the lesion evaporates, and air is incorporated into the tissue; during the second stage (drying longer than 10 min), the lesions hardly shrink anymore, but water is evaporated mainly from underlying sound dentine, followed by air incorporation...|$|E
40|$|Water {{absorption}} and {{frost heaving}} of aggregates {{have a strong}} influence {{on the performance of}} a highway pavement. This is because several mechanical properties of aggregates change in direct response to water ingress and ground freezing. Recycled aggregates of different types are increasingly being used in pavements; however, their frost heaving and water absorption potential has not been fully investigated and documented. In the present study the opportunity was taken to study the water absorption and freeze–thaw properties of three different aggregates: (i) 100 % recycled concrete aggregate, (ii) 100 % natural aggregate from limestone rock, and (iii) 50 % recycled concrete aggregate[*]+[*] 50 % reclaimed asphalt pavement. For different particle size ranges, extensive tests were carried out for each of the above materials ((i) –(iii)) using the <b>pyknometer</b> and wire basket methods as well as simulation in a self-refrigerated unit. The following three kinds of density were measured: (a) over-dry, (b) saturated and surface dry, and (c) apparent particle density. The 100 % natural aggregate had the lowest water absorption and highest densities ((a) –(c)) whereas the 100 % recycled concrete aggregate had the highest water absorption. In contrast to the above findings, the frost heave potential was found to be much less sensitive to the aggregate type and particle size. Water absorption of recycled concrete aggregate decreased with increasing mean particle size. The measured relationships between density, grading and water absorption led to increased understanding of the behaviour of materials containing different fractions of recycled concrete aggregate and reclaimed asphalt pavement...|$|E
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis consists of an examination of various physical properties of complete series of binary mixtures of aromatic liquids. The investigation was undertaken with a dual object in view: (1) To ascertain {{the nature of the}} physical or chemical changes occuring in the liquids on mixing and (2) To gain an insight into the relative suitability of the various physical properties for shewing the chemical changes which may have occured. The binary mixtures named below have been examined: (1) Toluene and m-Cresol. (2) Aniline and m-Cresol. (3) Aniline and Nitrobenzene. (4) m-Cresol and Benzene. (5) Toluene and benzene. (6) Nitrobenzene and m-Cresol. In each case the following five physical properties have been investigated: (1) Specific Gravity. (2) Refractive Index. (3) Heat of Mixing. (4) Specific Heat. (5) Magnetic Susceptibility, the liquids were purified very carefully, (constant boiling point and Specific gravity being the criterion of purity) and mixtures were prepared covering the whole concentration range, from one pure component to the other. Specific gravities were measured with a 2 cc. <b>pyknometer,</b> refractive indices with a Pulfrich refractometer used with a temperature control, heats of mixing and specific heats by the method of mixtures, and magnetic susceptibilities with a modified form of Curie balance. From the refractive indices, specific and molecular refractivity, dispersion, molecular dispersion, and dispersive power were calculated. In all cases the results are tabulated and from the tables, curves are drawn in which the value of the physical property as ordinate is plotted against the composition expressed in moles % as abscissa. It was found that (1) none of the mixtures was ideal, i,e. in all cases there was a change on mixing; and (2) the best properties for detecting changes are dispersion, heat of mixing, and magnetic susceptibility, the other properties examined not shewing very marked changes with the changes occurring on mixing. <p...|$|E
