40|$|Despite {{gains in}} the {{percentage}} of female <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> over past decades, female <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> are vastly underrepresented in modern <b>policing.</b> Female <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> face barriers to integration into policing and the surrounding culture that male <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> do not face, including unbalanced physical testing, double standards for success, and others. One explanation for the different experiences of female <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> compared to male <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> is the token status of women in policing. Instead of taking the token status of female <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> for granted, this study explored the utility of the theory of tokenism (Kanter, 1977) in explaining the experiences of female <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> in Midwestern <b>police</b> agencies. This is accomplished by looking for the presence of the three constructs of tokenism (visibility, contrast, and assimilation) in the accounts of 37 female <b>police</b> <b>officers...</b>|$|R

5|$|At 10:23, {{the judge}} raised a {{security}} alarm. Judicial officers, {{and a federal}} <b>police</b> <b>officer</b> {{who was in the}} court building testifying in an unrelated case, arrived at the scene; however, during the ongoing commotion the <b>police</b> <b>officer</b> mistook Okaz for the attacker and shot him in the upper leg. Wiens collapsed and was apprehended after one of the judges pointed out that not Okaz but Wiens was the assailant. While under arrest, Wiens resisted and begged the <b>police</b> <b>officer</b> to shoot him dead. Okaz, critically wounded in the stabbing attack, was in a coma for two days. He was subsequently treated for several weeks in a hospital near Dresden for the stabbing and shooting injuries. El-Sherbini died in the court building at 11:07, succumbing to her injuries.|$|E

40|$|The current {{research}} examined {{the influence of}} prior relationship on perceptions of stalking, and compared the perceptions of laypersons, nonspecialist <b>police</b> <b>officers,</b> and specialist <b>police</b> <b>officers.</b> Two studies employed experimental designs where participants were presented with one of three vignettes in which {{the nature of the}} prior relationship was manipulated so that the perpetrator and victim were portrayed as strangers, acquaintances, or ex-partners. Participants comprised 101 nonspecialist <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> and 108 laypersons in Study 1, and 49 specialist <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> and 49 nonspecialist <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> in Study 2. Findings indicate that nonspecialist <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> and laypersons shared the common misperception that stranger stalkers present a greater threat to the personal safety of their victims than acquaintance or ex-partner stalkers. Specialist <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> were less susceptible to common misperceptions and believed that intervention was more necessary. Specialist <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> also believed that the perpetrator’s behavior would cause the victim more alarm or personal distress than nonspecialist <b>police</b> <b>officers...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} female <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> has {{increased}} rapidly {{in the last two}} decades. Since policing is traditionally a male-dominated environment, female <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> could face potential gender-based barriers in the workforce. Despite this, the {{number of female}} <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> continues to increase. This paper will prove that due to the psychological differences between men and women, gender stereotypes, and police workplace culture, higher levels of stress exist for women than men. Female <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> are also less likely than men to engage in misconduct due to the barriers they encounter in the workplace. The findings match the hypothesis that though female <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> have the same starting motivations as male <b>police</b> <b>officers,</b> their motivation will fade away over time. In addition, even though female <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> engage less frequently in misconduct, they tend to assimilate into the environment after they spend some time in the field...|$|R
