The patients with perianal Paget 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> were older, {{had a higher}} incidence of invasive cancer, and had a worse prognosis than those with perianal Bowen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> The characteristic appearance of these lesions and their failure to respond to conventional therapy should lead the clinician to obtain a biopsy, which readily establishes the diagnosis. Our experience confirms that adequate evaluation followed by wide local excision is the appropriate therapy.

40|$|Purpose of review: To {{discuss the}} {{relationship}} between androgens, cognition and Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> Recent findings: It {{has been found that}} low circulating levels of androgens are a risk factor for Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> Decreased circulating androgens are also associated with declining cognitive performance, particularly in memory-related tasks. Conversely, androgen supplementation to hypogonadal men results in improved memory performance. It has therefore been hypothesized that androgen supplementation may be beneficial in Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> In recent studies, animal models have been used to elucidate the molecular mechanism behind this relationship between androgens and Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> These studies have shown that androgen depletion results in increased levels of beta amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau, changes which are thought to be associated with subsequent neuronal death.

40|$|The {{pathological}} {{hallmark of}} Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> is the degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons, leading to depletion of striatal dopamine. Recent neuroanatomical work has identified pathways for communication across striatal subdivisions, {{suggesting that the}} striatum provides a platform for integration of information across parallel corticostriatal circuits. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether dopaminergic dysfunction in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> was associated with impairments in functional connectivity across striatal subdivisions, which could potentially reflect reduced integration across corticostriatal circuits. Utilizing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we analyzed functional connectivity in 39 patients with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> both “on” and “off” their regular dopaminergic medications, along with 40 age-matched healthy controls. Our results demonstrate widespread impairments in connectivity across subdivisions of the striatum in patients with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> in the “off” state. The administration of dopaminergic medication significantly improved connectivity across striatal subdivisions in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> implicating dopaminergic deficits in the pathogenesis of impaired striatal interconnectivity. In addition, impaired striatal interconnectivity in the Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> “off” state was associated with pathological decoupling of the striatum from the thalamic and sensorimotor (SM) networks. Specifically, we found that although the strength of striatal interconnectivity was positively correlated with both (i) the strength of internal thalamic connectivity, and (ii) the strength of internal SM connectivity, in both healthy controls and the Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> “on” state, these relationships were absent in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> when in the “off” state.
