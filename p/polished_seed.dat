50|$|The Klein Iser Works {{were left}} in the capable hands of his kinsman Karl Kittel. Kittel retired in 1853 and was {{replaced}} by Johann Bengler, a bookkeeper from Christiansthal, who headed up the works for nearly forty years. Begler invented a number of coloured glass types including jet black, lily yellow, antimony ruby, marble-like variations, and the Venetian aventurine. He was awarded the Empire’s Golden Service Cross as a tribute to his glassmaking skills. In the early 1850s two long ‘pulling rooms’ were added to the glassworks. These were used to stretch glass to make tubes for the six faceted cut and <b>polished</b> <b>seed</b> beads then in demand.|$|E
30|$|To {{evaluate}} rhGCase expression {{levels in}} <b>polished</b> <b>seed,</b> serial extracts were diluited 1 : 100 in ELISA dilution buffer and analyzed separately. The total rhGCase amount was calculated and expressed as mg per kg of flour.|$|E
30|$|To <b>polish</b> <b>seeds,</b> 30 brown {{seeds from}} {{the ear of}} the main tiller were placed into a 2 -ml tube and shaken vigorously for 150  s at 2, 500  rpm {{for at least four}} cycles using a Multi-Beads Shocker (Yasui Kikai). Ten well-polished seeds from each plant were selected. After {{removing}} the embryos, <b>polished</b> <b>seeds</b> were dried overnight, weighed, digested, and then analyzed as described above.|$|R
30|$|NA {{concentration}} in T 2 {{seeds of the}} 35 S line and AN lines also increased compared to the NT line (Fig.  6). Usuda et al. (2009) produced transgenic rice that expressed HvNAS 1 {{under the control of}} an endosperm-specific promoter, OsGluB- 1. NA {{concentration in}} brown seeds of this transgenic line increased threefold compared to the NT line, and Fe concentration in <b>polished</b> <b>seeds</b> also increased 1.5 -fold (data not shown). Higher NA productivity in the endosperm of this transgenic rice might have improved Fe accumulation in seeds. Thus, enhanced NA synthesis in the 35 S and AN lines may have improved not only Fe translocation to <b>polished</b> <b>seeds</b> but also Fe accumulation in <b>polished</b> <b>seeds.</b>|$|R
30|$|More than 2 {{billion people}} suffer from iron (Fe) deficiency, and {{developing}} crop cultivars {{with an increased}} concentration of micronutrients (biofortification) can address this problem. In this review, we describe seven transgenic approaches, and combinations thereof, {{that can be used}} to increase the concentration of Fe in rice seeds. The first approach is to enhance the Fe storage capacity of grains through expression of the Fe storage protein ferritin under the control of endosperm-specific promoters. Using this approach, the concentration of Fe in the seeds of transformants was increased by approximately 2 -fold in <b>polished</b> <b>seeds.</b> The second approach is to enhance Fe translocation by overproducing the natural metal chelator nicotianamine; using this approach, the Fe concentration was increased by up to 3 -fold in <b>polished</b> <b>seeds.</b> The third approach is to enhance Fe influx to the endosperm by expressing the Fe(II)-nicotianamine transporter gene OsYSL 2 under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter and sucrose transporter promoter, which increased the Fe concentration by up to 4 -fold in <b>polished</b> <b>seeds.</b> The fourth approach is introduction of the barley mugineic acid synthesis gene IDS 3 to enhance Fe uptake and translocation within plants, which resulted in a 1.4 -fold increase in the Fe concentration in <b>polished</b> <b>seeds</b> during field cultivation. In addition to the above approaches, Fe-biofortified rice was produced using a combination of the first, second, and third approaches. The Fe concentration in greenhouse-grown T 2 <b>polished</b> <b>seeds</b> was 6 -fold higher and that in paddy field-grown T 3 <b>polished</b> <b>seeds</b> was 4.4 -fold higher than in non-transgenic seeds without any reduction in yield. When the first and fourth approaches were combined, the Fe concentration was greater than that achieved by introducing only the ferritin gene, and Fe-deficiency tolerance was observed. With respect to Fe biofortification, the introduction of multiple Fe homeostasis genes is more effective than the introduction of individual genes. Moreover, three additional approaches, i.e., overexpression of the Fe transporter gene OsIRT 1 or OsYSL 15, overexpression of the Fe deficiency-inducible bHLH transcription factor OsIRO 2, and knockdown of the vacuolar Fe transporter gene OsVIT 1 or OsVIT 2, may be useful to further increase the Fe concentration of seeds.|$|R
30|$|Goto et al. (1999) {{generated}} {{transgenic rice}} plants expressing the soybean ferritin gene SoyferH 1 in endosperms using the rice endosperm-specific, 1.3 -kb OsGluB 1 promoter. Transformants showed 3 -fold {{higher levels of}} Fe accumulation in brown seeds (Table  1). Additionally, the concentration of Fe in the endosperm was increased 2 -fold. This endosperm-specific expression of ferritin {{has been used to}} generate the following increases in Fe concentration in rice plants: a 2.2 -fold increase in brown seeds of transgenic japonica cv. Taipei 309 (Lucca et al. 2002), a 3.7 -fold increase in <b>polished</b> <b>seeds</b> of indica cv. IR 68144 (Vasconcelos et al. 2003), and a 2.1 -fold increase in <b>polished</b> <b>seeds</b> of indica cv. Pusa Sugandhi II (Paul et al. 2012) (Table  1).|$|R
30|$|To obtain <b>polished</b> <b>seeds,</b> 60 brown seeds {{were placed}} into a 2 -ml tube and shaken at 2, 500  rpm for 150  s, {{at least four}} times, using a Multi-beads Shocker (Yasui Kikai, Japan). Approximately 25 well-polished seeds from each {{replication}} were digested and their metal concentration measured.|$|R
30|$|Generally, Fe {{translocation}} {{ability to}} endosperm {{is low in}} rice. In fact, the Fe content of endosperm is significantly lower than in other rice tissue, including leaves, stems, roots, husk, or the aleurone layer. 0.5 % of total Fe content in aerial parts of plant {{body was found in}} <b>polished</b> <b>seeds</b> (endosperm) of Tsukinohikari rice variety, despite 3.6 % in brown seeds, 3.4 % in husk, 2.4 % in rachis and 90.6 % in straw, respectively (Masuda et al. 2008). Rice plants uptake certain amount of Fe, but the plant may not translocate it to endosperm positively. A strict regulation system may exist to control Fe translocation into endosperm in rice plants. This may explain why this approach does not significantly increase the Fe concentration in <b>polished</b> <b>seeds.</b>|$|R
30|$|Zhang et al. (2012) and Bashir et al. (2013) {{reported}} that the Cd concentration was also increased in VIT knockdown rice. Therefore, this approach should be avoided in Cd-contaminated soils. Although further studies are required for this approach, likewise approach 5 and 6, approach 7 may also be applied {{in combination with other}} approaches to further increase Fe concentrations in <b>polished</b> <b>seeds.</b>|$|R

30|$|Fe {{concentrations}} in rice seeds are generally low (Grusak and Cakmak 2005). Especially, rice is mainly consumed as <b>polished</b> <b>seeds,</b> and Fe levels are diminished by milling and polishing; thus, the remaining endosperm contains low Fe levels. In addition, within a rice-consuming country, rice consumption is lower {{in urban areas}} than in rural areas (Juliano, 1993). Therefore, a higher target Fe concentration in polished rice grain is desirable.|$|R
30|$|Rice is a {{particularly}} suitable target for biofortification because Fe-deficiency anemia {{is a serious problem}} in developing countries where rice is a major staple crop (WHO 2002; Juliano 1993). Brown rice is rich in mineral value. However, rice is mostly consumed in the polished form (the endosperm tissue), which contains low mineral levels (Grusak and Cakmak 2005). Biofortification can be applied to increase the Fe concentrations in <b>polished</b> <b>seeds</b> and achieve the target Fe demand for human nutrition.|$|R
30|$|Jeng et al. (2012) {{discovered}} mutant {{lines that}} have higher Fe or Zn concentrations in <b>polished</b> <b>seeds</b> by searching among NaN 3 -induced mutant lines (Oryza sativa cv. IR 64). Ruengphayak et al. (2012) screened 12, 000 fast neutron-irradiated M 4 mutant lines (Oryza sativa cv. Jao Hom Nin) and identified 76 mutant lines that contained higher Fe densities in the grains. Using these high-Fe mutant rice lines, {{it is possible}} to identify novel candidate genes to improve Fe biofortification of rice.|$|R
30|$|Higuchi et al. (2001 a) {{produced}} {{transgenic rice}} expressing HvNAS 1 {{under the control}} of the cauliflower mosaic virus constitutive CaMV 35 S promoter. NA concentration in plant shoot increased 3 -fold in this transgenic rice. Based on these results, we hypothesized that enhancing the expression of NAS could increase the NA concentration within the plant body and, as a consequence, increase the Fe concentration in seeds. Therefore, we produced transgenic rice overexpressing HvNAS 1 {{under the control of}} the OsActin 1 promoter or 35 S promoter (Masuda et al. 2009). HvNAS 1 -overexpressing transgenic rice showed increased HvNAS 1 expression and increased endogenous NA levels in the shoots and seeds by 5 to 10 -fold (Masuda et al. 2009). The Fe and Zn concentrations in the T 1 <b>polished</b> <b>seeds</b> from the transgenic plants increased more than 3 -fold and 2 -fold, respectively. The Fe concentrations also increased 2 -fold in the T 2 <b>polished</b> <b>seeds</b> (Table  1). Lee et al. (2009 c) and Johnson et al. (2011) showed that NAS overexpression increased the Fe concentration in <b>polished</b> rice <b>seeds</b> by 3 – 4 -fold (Table  1). Thus, Fe transport within the plant body, including the phloem, may be improved by NAS overexpression (Masuda et al. 2009; Lee et al. 2009 c; Johnson et al. 2011). Moreover, Lee et al. (2009 c) reported that Fe-biofortified rice overexpressing OsNAS 3 by virtue of an enhancer tag mitigated Fe-deficiency anemia in mice to a greater degree than non-transgenic rice seeds.|$|R
30|$|We {{attempted}} {{to increase the}} Fe concentrations in rice seeds {{using a combination of}} the first and fourth approaches (Figure  1). We introduced the SoyferH 2 gene driven by two endosperm-specific promoters (the OsGluB 1 promoter and OsGlb 1 promoter), together with three fragments of the barley genome (5.9 kb of HvNAS 1, 11 kb of HvNAAT-A,-B, and 6 kb of IDS 3) to enhance MA production in rice plants (Table  2) (Masuda et al. 2013). Representative lines were selected and grown in commercially supplied soil (Fe-sufficient condition) or calcareous soil (low Fe-available condition). Lines expressing both ferritin and the MA biosynthetic genes showed signs of tolerance to Fe deficiency in the calcareous soil. The concentrations of Fe in the T 3 <b>polished</b> <b>seeds</b> were increased by 4 - and 2.5 -fold compared with the levels in non-transgenic lines grown in normal soil and calcareous soil, respectively (Table  2). During calcareous soil cultivation, the Fe concentration in <b>polished</b> <b>seeds</b> was increased in Fer-NAS-NAAT-IDS 3 lines, but not in the Ferritin-introduced line compared to non-transgenic lines. These results indicated that the concomitant introduction of the ferritin and MA biosynthetic genes effectively increased Fe levels in seeds without inducing Fe sensitivity under Fe-limited conditions.|$|R

The Bohemian bead production became instantly out-dated and could no longer compete. Josef Riedel Jr. travelled to Venice and recruited three Italian technicians. Their names were Tocellan, Morichetto and Giordani. With the input of Wilhelm and Josef junior, the three Venetian engineers improved and developed the original Venetian cutting machine in the Riedel bronze foundry. It was able to produce 3.000 tons of machine-cut seed beads per year.|$|R

3000|$|... osvit 2 plants {{accumulated}} less Fe {{in their}} shoots when grown under normal or excess Fe conditions, while {{the accumulation of}} Fe was comparable to that in wild-type (WT) plants under Fe-deficient conditions. The accumulation of zinc, copper, and manganese also changed significantly in the shoots of osvit 2 plants. The growth of osvit 2 plants was also slow {{compared to that of}} WT plants. The concentration of Fe increased in osvit 2 <b>polished</b> <b>seeds.</b> Previously, we reported that the expression of OsVIT 2 was higher in MIT knockdown (mit- 2) plants, and in this study, the accumulation of Fe in mit- 2 seeds decreased significantly.|$|R

30|$|Fe {{deficiency}} anemia is {{prevalent in}} many populations in Myanmar (MOH 2003). Myanmar {{has one of}} the highest per capita rice consumption rates (average, 578 g per day) globally (Maclean et al. 2002). Thus, Myanmar rice is a suitable target for Fe biofortification. Therefore, we introduced this Fer-NAS-YSL 2 gene into the Paw San Yin variety, which is a popular high-quality rice variety in Myanmar (Aung et al. 2013). Paw San Yin transgenic rice was produced successfully, and the concentration of Fe in the Paw San Yin Fer-NAS-YSL 2 line increased 3.4 -fold in <b>polished</b> <b>seeds,</b> which was close to the dietary target level for people in Myanmar (Table  2) (Aung et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|Iron (Fe) {{deficiency}} causes elevates human mortality rates, {{especially in}} developing countries. In Myanmar, {{the prevalence of}} Fe-deficient anemia in children and pregnant women are 75 % and 71 %, respectively. Myanmar people {{have one of the}} highest per capita rice consumption rates globally. Consequently, production of Fe-biofortified rice would likely contribute to solving the Fe-deficiency problem in this human population. To produce Fe-biofortified Myanmar rice by transgenic methods, we first analyzed callus induction and regeneration efficiencies in 15 varieties that are presently popular because of their high yields and/or qualities. Callus formation and regeneration efficiency in each variety was strongly influenced by types of culture media containing a range of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid concentrations. The Paw San Yin variety, which has a high Fe content in <b>polished</b> <b>seeds,</b> performed well in callus induction and regeneration trials. Thus, we transformed this variety using a gene expression cassette that enhanced Fe transport within rice plants through overexpression of the nicotianamine synthase gene HvNAS 1, Fe flow to the endosperm through the Fe(II) -nicotianamine transporter gene OsYSL 2, and Fe accumulation in endosperm by the Fe storage protein gene SoyferH 2. A line with a transgene insertion was successfully obtained. Enhanced expressions of the introduced genes OsYSL 2, HvNAS 1, and SoyferH 2 occurred in immature T 2 seeds. The transformants accumulated 3. 4 -fold higher Fe concentrations, and also 1. 3 -fold higher zinc concentrations in T 2 <b>polished</b> <b>seeds</b> compared to levels in non-transgenic rice. This Fe-biofortified rice has the potential to reduce Fe-deficiency anemia in millions of Myanmar people without changing food habits and without introducing additional costs...|$|R
30|$|In {{spite of}} these root responses, rice is highly {{susceptible}} to Fe deficiency (Mori et al. [1991]). Insufficient Fe causes the plant disease Fe chlorosis, which is characterized by yellowing of new leaves and severely impacts grain yield. Rice is also a characteristic crop which contains low concentration of Fe in <b>polished</b> <b>seeds,</b> thus is disadvantageous as a major Fe supply in human diet. Understanding of the molecular components of Fe uptake and translocation and their regulation has paved the way to develop crops that are tolerant to Fe deficiency, both to improve food and biomass production, {{as well as to}} develop Fe-rich crops for improved human nutrition (reviewed in Kobayashi and Nishizawa [2012]; Bashir et al. [2013]; Masuda et al. [2013]).|$|R
30|$|Manipulating the {{expression}} of membrane transporters can increase Fe concentrations in crops (Schroeder et al. 2013). Thus, the third approach to increase Fe concentrations in rice was to enhance Fe influx to seeds by expressing the Fe(II)-NA transporter gene OsYSL 2 (Figure  1; Approach 3). Koike et al. (2004) identified the rice OsYSL 2 gene, which is preferentially expressed in leaf phloem cells, the vascular bundles of flowers and developing seeds, suggesting a role in internal Fe transport. The Fe concentration in OsYSL 2 knockdown rice was 18 % lower in brown seeds and 39 % lower in <b>polished</b> <b>seeds</b> compared with non-transgenic rice (Ishimaru et al. 2010). Thus, OsYSL 2 {{plays an important role}} in the transport of Fe to rice seeds.|$|R

40|$|Thiamin {{diphosphate}} (ThDP), {{also known}} as vitamin B 1, serves as an enzymatic cofactor in glucose metabolism, the Krebs cycle, and branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis in all living organisms. Unlike plants and microorganisms, humans {{are not able to}} synthesize ThDP de novo and must obtain it from their diet. Staple crops such as rice are poor sources of thiamin. Hence, populations that mainly consume rice commonly suffer thiamin deficiency. In addition to thiamin’s nutritional function, studies in rice have shown that some thiamin biosynthesis genes are involved in resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae (Xoo), which causes a serious disease in rice fields. This study shows that overexpression of two thiamin biosynthesis genes, 4 -methyl- 5 -β-hydroxyethylthiazole phosphate synthase and 4 -amino- 2 -methyl- 5 -hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate synthase involved in the first steps of the thiazole and pyrimidine synthesis branches, respectively, increased thiamin content up to five-fold in unpolished seeds that retain the bran. However, thiamin levels in <b>polished</b> <b>seeds</b> with removed bran were similar to those found in <b>polished</b> control <b>seeds.</b> Plants with higher accumulation of thiamin did not show enhanced resistance to Xoo.

30|$|We {{generated}} {{transgenic rice}} by introducing multiple genes, including ferritin {{under the control}} of endosperm-specific promoters, NAS overexpression, OsSUT 1 promoter-driven OsYSL 2 expression, and the barley IDS 3 genome fragment, and showed increased concentrations of bioavailable Fe. This technique could be applied to mitigate the global problem of Fe-deficiency anemia. However, further efforts in Fe biofortification of rice are required to increase further Fe concentrations in <b>polished</b> <b>seeds</b> and reach the recommended levels. Increasing the expression of OsIRT 1, OsYSL 15, and OsIRO 2, or knockdown of OsVIT 1 or OsVIT 2 are the candidate approaches to improve Fe biofortification of rice seeds. Further attempts are required to evaluate high-Fe rice varieties or other target genes. A combination of these approaches will be beneficial to future Fe biofortification work.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to seed Fe and Zn concentration, Fe and Zn content per seed in T 2 seeds of AN lines also increased {{compared to those}} of the NT line (Fig.  5). There was no significant correlation between yield and Fe or Zn concentration in <b>polished</b> <b>seeds</b> in each T 2 plant of NT, AN 1, and AN 3 lines (data not shown). Therefore, it can be postulated that increased Fe and Zn concentration in seeds of transgenic lines was not due to decreased grain size or yield. Fe and Zn concentration in leaves of AN lines were not significantly increased compared to NT (Fig.  7 e, f). Overexpression of HvNAS 1 might not lead to Fe and Zn overaccumulation in leaves. We observed no symptom of Fe toxicity in transgenic rice lines.|$|R
30|$|These {{results suggest}} that vacuolar Fe {{trafficking}} is important for plant Fe homeostasis and distribution, especially in plants grown {{in the presence of}} excess Fe.

30|$|Fe {{concentration}} {{was increased}} significantly in Fer-NAS-YSL 2 rice (Masuda et al. 2012) because the introduced genes, ferritin, HvNAS 1 and OsYSL 2, functioned synergistically as follows: Overexpression of the NAS gene increased the NA and DMA {{concentrations in the}} plant body. Abundant NA and DMA facilitated the formation of Fe(II)–NA or Fe(III)–DMA. Additionally, Fe(II) or Fe(III) transport in the plant body, including in the phloem, was improved by NAS overexpression. For effective translocation of enhanced Fe(II)–NA in phloem sap, we engineered the Fe(II)–NA transporter OsYSL 2 {{to be under the}} control of the OsSUT 1 promoter.
