50|$|In {{addition}} to the repeater match listed above, the N-SSA offers a category for single shot breechloading weapons. Both externally primed percussion weapons (mainly the Sharps 1859 rifle and rifle versions of the Maynard) as well as internally <b>primed</b> <b>cartridge</b> guns (such as the Ballard, Frank Wesson, and so on) are used.|$|R
50|$|French gunsmith Benjamin Houllier {{improved}} the Lefaucheux pinfire cardboard cartridge and patented in Paris in 1846, the first fully metallic pinfire cartridge containing powder (and a pinfire), in a metallic cartridge. He {{also included in}} his patent claims rim and centerfire <b>primed</b> <b>cartridges</b> using brass or copper casings. Houllier commercialised his weapons {{in association with the}} gunsmiths Blanchard or Charles Robert.|$|R
50|$|A wax bullet is {{a bullet}} made of wax, often {{paraffin}} wax or some mixture of waxes and other substances that produce the desired consistency. Wax bullets are typically {{used in a}} <b>primed</b> <b>cartridge</b> case, with no gunpowder. The primer provides all the necessary power to propel the wax bullet at low velocities. Wax bullets have been in use for over a century, providing a projectile for use in training, indoor shooting, and shooting competitions where a high velocity metal bullet would be needlessly hazardous.|$|R
50|$|Safety testing {{exceeded}} the ANSI/SAAMI requirements adopted in May 1990. These included dropping a USP with a <b>primed</b> <b>cartridge</b> and decocked hammer {{on a variety}} of hard surfaces without discharging. The USP surpassed these commercial requirements, as well as German Army and police tests, including repeated drop tests from six feet (1.8 m), hammer first, onto a steel backed concrete slab. Proof round firing resulted in no cracks, deformations, or increase in head space. Attempts to fire the USP pistol with an unlocked breech proved unsuccessful.|$|R
50|$|Factory {{ammunition}} {{was produced}} by the Super Cartridge Company, Riverbrand, IMI and Sportco, some using new Boxer primed cases (single flash hole and primer has anvil), others using military Berdan primed cases (double flash hole cartridge and primer has no anvil). Factory cartridges are far easier to reload once fired in comparison to military cartridges, because military cartridges have a crimped in Berdan primer. Berden <b>primed</b> <b>cartridges</b> also have a double flash hole, making their removal difficult because the standard decapping die only has a single decapping pin.|$|R
50|$|The Swiss gun maker Samuel Joannes Pauly {{patented}} {{the first}} breechloading cartridge in 1812. This was {{for use in}} a shotgun with fixed barrels which was loaded by lifting a breech block on the top. French gun maker Henri Roux attempted to improve this cartridge in the 1820s but a constantly <b>primed</b> <b>cartridge</b> was felt by many to be too dangerous and many breechloading guns reverted to using an unprimed cartridge. This was fired by a separate percussion cap which was used on the still dominant muzzle-loading guns.|$|R

40|$|Treball final de Grau en Química. Codi: QU 0943. Curs acadèmic 2015 - 2016 An {{analytical}} method {{has been developed}} for the simultaneous quantification and determination of organophosphorus pesticides in surface water by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry with a triple quadrupole analyzer. The study {{has been focused on}} the determination of three insecticides of the same chemical family. In this work, a solid phase extraction was performed using Oasis HLB <b>PRiME</b> <b>cartridges</b> and an isotopically-labeled internal standard was added before extraction as surrogate. Analyses were performed by gas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in electron ionization mode, and three MS/MS transitions were acquired for each analyte, using q/Q ratio as a confirmatory parameter. The method was validated at two levels: 0. 15 μg L- 1 and 0. 75 μg L- 1. The recoveries obtained were between 70 - 120 % and the relative standard deviations were lower than 20 %. Once the method was validated, it was applied to the analysis of surface water collected from Castellón (Spain) and no positive findings were obtained...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe effect of varying {{the point of}} ignition of the powder charge within a cartridge case was investigated with respect to both pressure and velocity. By installing a small tube {{in the base of}} the cartridge case it was possible to transfer the primer flash to the forward part of the case. Ignition of the powder charge at the top instead of the base gave lower chamber pressures by as much as 6, 300 psi and increased muzzle velocity by 35 ft/s. When additional powder was added to obtain the same chamber pressure as a conventionally <b>primed</b> <b>cartridge,</b> muzzle velocities increased by 50 ft/s. When the pressure was brought up past the original level, but kept within normally accepted limits for the 7. 62 mm NATO round, velocities increased by 100 ft/s over the original load. In order to shape the pressure curve, different loading schemes were tested. Various amounts of powders and powders of different burning rates were layered within the same case, the slowest burning powder being ignited first. Lcwer pressures and flatter pressure peaks were realized from these configurations. The chamber pressure was reduced by 6, 000 psi and the muzzle velocity increased by 100 ft/s.

50|$|Electrically <b>primed</b> {{small arms}} <b>cartridges</b> retain the primer which {{functions}} {{in the same way}} as a conventional primer. Rather than being struck by a firing pin or equivalent mechanical means, a small electric current serves to detonate the primer which provides the thermal impulse necessary to ignite the propellant which then deflagrates, producing pressure.|$|R
5000|$|Wax bullets can {{be easily}} {{constructed}} by using a cartridge case to punch a cylinder out of a sheet of paraffin wax, and then <b>priming</b> the <b>cartridge</b> using normal handloading equipment. The optional addition of beeswax and/or grease will produce a softer, more flexible bullet than pure paraffin. [...] Higher velocities may be obtained using special cartridges drilled out to accept shotgun primers, which provide higher velocities, and some fast draw competitions allow {{the use of a}} small amount of black powder or black powder substitute to provide higher velocities for certain events. Commercially produced wax bullets are also available, and may be required for competitions. These pre-formed bullets are simply pressed into the case mouth.|$|R
50|$|Some Southern {{states had}} {{purchased}} Maynards for their state militias in late 1860 and early 1861. About 3000 Maynards were in Southern hands during the war, mostly in Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi units. The First Model Maynard {{was listed as}} an official firearm in Confederate ordnance manuals. The Maynard had a good reputation for long range accuracy and Confederate sharpshooters made extensive use of it, especially during the Siege of Charleston. Maynard cartridges were easily manufactured in the Confederacy, {{in contrast to the}} complex internally <b>primed</b> rimfire <b>cartridges</b> of captured Spencer and Henry rifles. The Maynard was easily adaptable to these newer cartridges {{and it was one of}} the few patent breechloaders to survive the Civil War. It continued in production as a highly regarded centerfire target and hunting rifle until 1890.|$|R
5000|$|The only breech-loading rifle (not {{built as}} a carbine like the Burnside) firing a primed-metallic {{cartridge}} (a [...]50 cal. rimfire) made by the Federal Government (at Springfield Armory) and actually designed for issue to infantrymen was the Model 1865 Springfield Joslyn Rifle, of which only 3,007 were made. In fact, this rifle was the first breechloader ever made in any national armory that fired a <b>primed</b> metallic <b>cartridge.</b> It was basically a Joslyn Carbine action fitted to an 1863 Springfield barrel and stock (though heavily modified). It was issued to disabled soldiers of the Veteran Reserve Corps very late in the war (April 1865) and likely was never used in action. However, it established the single-shot metallic cartridge breechloader as a standard infantry weapon, which eventually all modern armies adopted {{in one form or}} another. The US adopted the breechloading 1866 Springfield [...] "Trapdoor" [...] infantry rifle built from surplus rifle-musket parts after the war.|$|R
50|$|Rimfire is {{a method}} of {{ignition}} for metallic firearm cartridges {{as well as the}} cartridges themselves. It is called rimfire because the firing pin of a gun strikes and crushes the base's rim to ignite the primer. The rim of the rimfire cartridge is essentially an extended and widened percussion cap which contains the priming compound, while the cartridge case itself contains the propellant powder and the projectile (bullet). Once the rim of the cartridge has been struck and the bullet discharged, the cartridge cannot be reloaded, because the head has been deformed by the firing pin impact. While many other different <b>cartridge</b> <b>priming</b> methods have been tried since the 19th century, only rimfire technology and centerfire technology survive today in significant use.|$|R
50|$|Casimir Lefaucheux of Paris {{decided in}} 1832 to patent a breechloader where the barrel hinged {{downwards}} {{to reveal the}} breech ends. These still used a separate percussion cap. Though used before this, (as seen in surviving pinfire shotshells that lists the names of early gun makers he signed contracts with in 1833 and 1834,) in 1835 he was granted an addition to the 1832 patent for {{a new type of}} cartridge in which the <b>cartridge's</b> <b>priming</b> compound is ignited by striking a small pin which protrudes radially from just above the base of the cartridge. These pins fitted into a small groove cut in the top of each barrel-end and made it easy to see if the gun was loaded. The cartridge used metal bases (often brass) with paper tubes which were usually loaded by the shooter or his staff but were not entirely gas-tight. This reduced the force of the charge and allowed powder residue and gas to escape.|$|R
40|$|Contour {{blasting}} {{is commonly}} performed by employing linear charges, decoupled from the boreholes. This method {{is common in}} surface and underground excavations, either for civil or mining purposes. To achieve the best results in terms of rock breakage and respect of the excavation profile, blasting theory suggests that charges should be inserted coaxial to the holes to grant uniform distribution of the explosive energy and therefore obtaining a uniform Radius of Damage. Nonetheless, due to readiness of operations or lack of availability of specific products on the market, non-coaxial charges are often employed in blasting practice. Non-coaxial charging methods include the employ of high-power detonating cord (40 to 100 g/m), low-power detonating cord connecting small-diameter cartridges (commonly 10 g/m detonating cord <b>priming</b> 1 " <b>cartridges)</b> or string loading (a thin layer of bulk emulsion pumped with controlled flow and controlled extraction of the injecting rod). This research focuses on evaluating {{the effects of the}} first two charging methods on the quality of final walls in open-pit and underground operations. Different drilling geometries and charging configurations were applied to both quarrying and tunneling blasts. The Half-Cast Factor (HCF), the Over-break (OB) and the Under-Break (UB) were evaluated as control indicators. Rock Quality Designation (RQD) and Rock Mass Rating (RMR) were used to classify the rock mass. The research was aimed to push contour blasts to their limits, observing for which geometry and charge configuration the blast lost its design threshold with respect to the final wall for every given rock mass. Results show the operational limits of non-coaxial charges encountered in the rock masses object of this study. In good-quality rock, smooth blasting with decoupled linear charge of 40 g/m can be extended to a spacing S = 22 Øf with little or no detectable drawbacks in terms of final wall quality, in contrast with theoretical formulae for the determination of the radius of damage. On the other hand, when the rock is poor, any quality of the final wall is hardly achieved at all, in spite of any care in the details of execution of smooth blasting. It is concluded that any design criterion and theoretical approach modeling the effects of contour blasting cannot ignore the features of the rock mas...|$|R
