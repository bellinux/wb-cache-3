5000|$|Similarities {{between the}} {{chemistry}} of pyrethrins and synthetic pyrethroids is that have a similar mode of action and almost identical toxicity to insects (i.e. both <b>pyrethrins</b> <b>and</b> <b>pyrethroids</b> induce a toxic effect within the insect by acting on sodium channels) ...|$|E
50|$|As <b>pyrethrins</b> <b>and</b> <b>pyrethroids</b> are {{increasingly}} being used as insecticides, the number of illnesses and injuries associated with exposure to these chemicals is also increasing. However, few cases leading to serious health effects or mortality in humans have occurred, which is why pyrethroids are labeled “low-toxicity” chemicals and are ubiquitous in home-care products. Pyrethrins are widely regarded as better for the environment, and can be harmless if used only in the field with localized sprays, as UV exposure breaks them down into harmless compounds. Additionally, they have little lasting effect on plants, degrading naturally or being degraded by the cooking process.|$|E
40|$|Objective. <b>Pyrethrin</b> <b>and</b> <b>pyrethroid</b> {{insecticides}} {{are commonly}} applied in {{homes and businesses}} and on some agricultural crops. This research used a two-state regional approach to analyze reports of acute pesticide poisonings due to <b>pyrethrin</b> <b>and</b> <b>pyrethroid</b> insecticides. Methods. The Washington State Department of Health and the Oregon Public Health Division collected pesticide poisoning surveillance data from 2001 through 2005. Cases were included if they involved exposure {{to at least one}} pyrethrin or pyrethroid insecticide. Descriptive statistics were calculated; differ-ences between categories were assessed using Chi-square analysis. Results. A total of 407 cases fit our definition. Overall, the rate of poisoning in Oregon was significantly higher than in Washington (incidence rate ratio 1. 70, 95 % confidence interval 1. 40, 2. 07), and rates for both states generally increased during the time period. For both states, most exposures resulted in low severity illnesses (92 %), and most were classified as possible cases (73 %) ...|$|R
50|$|Today, {{insecticides}} {{used for}} the treatment of head lice include organochlorines (lindane), organophosphates (malathion), carbamates (carbaryl), <b>pyrethrins</b> (pyrethrum), <b>and</b> <b>pyrethroids</b> (permethrin, phenothrin, bio-allethrin).|$|R
50|$|It is {{also used}} {{extensively}} as an ingredient with insecticides to control insect pests {{in and around the}} home, in food-handling establishments such as restaurants, and for human and veterinary applications against ectoparasites (head lice, ticks, fleas). A wide variety of water-based PBO-containing products such as crack and crevice sprays, total release foggers, and flying insect sprays are produced for and sold to consumers for home use. PBO has an important public health role as a synergist used in <b>pyrethrins</b> <b>and</b> <b>pyrethroid</b> formulations used for mosquito control (e.g. space sprays, surface sprays and bed nets). Because of its limited, if any, insecticidal properties, PBO is never used alone.|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} case of a subject {{developing}} anosmia, preceded by nasal transient irritation and short lasting phantosmia and torqosmia, upon re-entrance into a room treated with a pyrethrins-based insecticide. The concentration of the insecticide in the room is unknown, but relatively high levels are predicted basing upon the modality of exposure and by the irritation symptoms in the subject. Despite corticosteroids therapy, anosmia has persisted unmodified for more than three years; according to, and based on evidence in the literature on olfactory disturbance prognosis, anosmia in this patient is likely to be permanent. The significance of this case report is related to the current wide use of insecticides containing pyrethrin and pyrethroids and highlights the need for more adequate attention to lowering airborne concentrations of <b>pyrethrins</b> <b>and</b> <b>pyrethroids</b> prior to re-entering the treated rooms. In particular, in a closed space sprayed with <b>pyrethrins</b> <b>and</b> <b>pyrethroids</b> insecticide, any irritant symptoms and/or dysosmia should be immediately considered relevant warning signs, and must be avoided...|$|E

40|$|In {{a screen}} of 1800 plant and fungal {{extracts}} for antiplasmodial, antitrypanosomal, and leishmanicidal activity, the n-hexane extract of Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium (Trevir.) Vis. flowers showed strong activity against Plasmodium falciparum. We isolated the five pyrethrins [i. e., pyrethrin II (1), jasmolin II (2), cinerin II (3), pyrethrin I (4), and jasmolin I (5) ] from this extract. These were tested together with 15 synthetic pyrethroids for their activity against P. falciparum and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and for cytotoxicity in rat myoblast L 6 cells. The natural pyrethrins showed antiplasmodial activity with IC(50) s between 4 and 12 ?M, and antitrypanosomal activity with IC(50) s from 7 to 31 ?M.

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1800 s {{the range of}} {{synthesized}} chemicals has increased dramatically to include pesticides, plastics, hydrocarbon fuels, soaps, detergents and other useful substances. The effects in the environment are result of a sequence of processes that depend on the properties of individual chemical. DDT {{has been the focus}} of a large amount of early research due to its effects on the endocrine system leading to egg shell thinning and reduced breeding in birds. DDT is a member of chlorohydrocarbons, a family of chemically related insecticides. Chlorohydrocarbons are highly toxic to aquatic organisms, persistent, soluble in fat and have very low solubility in water. They move from water to animals with a large increase in concentration by a process described as bioaccumulation. This group, banned from use in many countries, includes industrial chemicals such as PCBs and combustion products like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins and furans. In terms of used quantities herbicides are of major importance but their properties differ significantly from chlorohydrocarbons. Herbicides are relatively water soluble but less soluble in fat and less persistent. Thus they don't bioaccumulate and are less toxic having a much lower impact in the environment. Organophosphates, carbamates, <b>pyrethrins</b> <b>and</b> <b>pyrethroids</b> also have, in general, low solubility in fat, relatively high solubility in water but low persistence and are not bioaccumulative. Members of this group can be highly toxic to biota including mammals and aquatic organisms but overall their environmental effects are usually low. Soaps and detergents, containing surfactants, have relatively low toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation. Although discharged to environment in large quantities their effects are generally low. Plastics differ from other contaminants since these substances enter environment as solid wastes with little toxicity but have other adverse environmental effects. The management of these effects relates to their degradation and removal from the system. No Full Tex...|$|E
50|$|PBO {{acts as an}} {{insecticide}} synergist by inhibiting {{the natural}} defense mechanisms of the insect, {{the most important of}} which is the mixed-function oxidase system, (MFOs) also known as the cytochrome P-450 system. The MFO system is the primary route of detoxification in insects, and causes the oxidative breakdown of insecticides such as <b>pyrethrins</b> <b>and</b> the synthetic <b>pyrethroids</b> - thus when PBO is added, higher insecticide levels remain in the insect to exercise their lethal effect. An important consequence of this property is that, by enhancing the activity of a given insecticide, less may be used to achieve the same result.|$|R
40|$|Because {{resistance}} to new insecticides may develop rapidly and cross resistance is often encountered, even between insecticides of different classes, {{there is a}} continual demand {{for the development of}} new compounds toxic to insects. There is at present a choice between chlorinated hydrocarbons, organophosphorus compounds, carbamates, <b>pyrethrins,</b> synthetic <b>pyrethroids</b> <b>and</b> thiocyanates. This paper discusses thoroughly the present status {{of a large number of}} insecticides, the cross-resistances between them, and the most effective methods of application. It also examines some of the biochemical mechanisms responsible for resistance and the attempts that have been made to use substances capable of inhibiting these mechanisms as synergists of insecticides...|$|R
40|$|During July _ September 2009, ground ultra low volume (ULV) {{applications}} of various registered mosquito adulticide formulations were evaluated {{in a field}} assay against both wild populations and an insecticide-susceptible laboratory colony of Culex pipiens sensu lato. Initial applications with piperonyl butoxide (PBO) synergized formulations of natural <b>pyrethrins</b> <b>and</b> selected synthetic <b>pyrethroids</b> indicated that the wild populations in question had varying degrees of resistance to these products. Laboratory bottle-bioassay testing confirmed these observations. _x 000 D_Adult female surveillance using carbon dioxide baited CDC traps and Bermuda grass infusion gravid traps were also utilized to quantify population impacts of ground ULV applications.

40|$|Aerosol {{applications}} of reduced risk insecticides such as <b>pyrethrins,</b> <b>pyrethroids,</b> <b>and</b> insect growth regulators {{are becoming more}} commonly used to manage stored-product insects in food facilities. However, these applications have a limited ability to penetrate into hidden refugia, {{where the majority of}} the pest population is located. Horizontal transfer of insecticides could occur as individuals directly treated or exposed to treated surfaces move into hidden refugia and encounter untreated individuals. In this series of studies, the potential for horizontal transfer of methoprene from treated Tribolium castaneum, the red flour beetle, to untreated individuals was evaluated. Adding larvae, pupae, or adults treated with methoprene to flour patches with untreated T. castaneum larvae, resulted in increased pupa and adult deformities and higher numbers of dead focal individuals, which suggests the potential for this mechanism. The transfer mechanism might be flour substrate contamination, transfer during contact of individuals, and/or cannibalism of individuals exposed to insecticides. Experiments focused on isolating the impact of contact and cannibalism on horizontal transfer did not detect a significant increase in mortality. Experiments focused on flour substrate contamination resulted in decreased adult emergence as well as lower survival, and higher rates of deformities. These findings suggest that substrate contamination is the more likely mechanism for horizontal transfer, and although horizontal transfer can occur, the impact of this process on populations needs further evaluation...|$|R
