It begins with the <b>Project</b> <b>Baseline</b> study, which will collect phenotypic health data from approximately 10,000 participants {{over the course of}} at least four years. The project employs experts from widely varying fields including science, medicine, user experience and design, engineering and patient advocacy. The project is not the first one to aim to collect data on many individuals for medical purposes, but it aims to collect a much larger amount of data covering a broader array of topics than its predecessors. De-identified <b>Project</b> <b>Baseline</b> study data will be available to qualified researchers for exploratory analysis in the future.

40|$|The basic {{geometry}} of a stellar interferometer with two telescopes {{consists of a}} baseline vector and a direction to a star.

The position angle of the <b>projected</b> <b>baseline</b> is defined, measured in a plane tangential to the celestial sphere, tangent point at the position of the star.

40|$|The basic vector {{geometry}} of a stellar interferometer with two telescopes {{is defined by}} the right triangle of (i) the baseline vector between the telescopes, of (ii) the delay vector which points to the star, and of (iii) the <b>projected</b> <b>baseline</b> vector in the plane of the wave front of the stellar light. The plane of this triangle intersects the celestial sphere at the position of the star; the intersection is a circular line segment. The interferometric angular resolution is high (diffraction limited to the ratio of the wavelength over the <b>projected</b> <b>baseline</b> length) in the two directions along this line segment, and low (diffraction limited to the ratio of the wavelength over the telescope diameter) perpendicular to these.

50|$|The {{determination}} of additionality and {{the calculation of}} emission reductions depends on the emissions that would have occurred without the project minus the emissions of the project. Accordingly, the CDM process requires an established baseline or comparative emission estimate. The construction of a <b>project</b> <b>baseline</b> often depends on hypothetical scenario modeling, and may be estimated through reference to emissions from similar activities and technologies in the same country or other countries, or to actual emissions prior to project implementation.

Independent third party verification is meant to avoid this potential problem.|$|E

40|$|The {{use of an}} {{orbiting}} antenna in a VLBI experiment {{complicates the}} data correlation, due to the spacecraft motion {{and the presence of}} the satellite-to-ground link. For this experiment, using a TDRSS satellite, a multistep method was used to calculate delay and phase for correlation and fringe-fitting. Data from three sources: 1510 - 089, NRAO 530 (1730 - 130), and 174 l- 038 were successfully correlated. The maximum <b>projected</b> <b>baseline</b> achieved was 1. 4 earth diameters, for NRAO 530, with baselines longer than one earth diameter obtained for all three sources.

The cost estimate for work during FY 98 continues to be $ 2. OM as published in Revision 3. 0. However, the funds will be all CENRTC rather than the OPEX/CENTRC split previously anticipated. LLNL has waived overhead charges on ETD Project CENRTC funds since the beginning of project activities. By requesting the $ 2. OM as all CENTRC a more aggressive approach to staffing and testing can be taken. Due to a cost under- run condition during FY 97 procurements were made and work was accomplished, with the knowledge of DOE, in the Feed Preparation and Final Forms areas that were not in the scope of Revision 3. 0.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} {{requirements on}} station-keeping for constellations of free-flying collectors coupled as (future) imaging arrays in space for astrophysics applications are examined.

"Rules-of-thumb" are determined for the typical accuracy required on these parameters. The requirement on the <b>projected</b> <b>baseline</b> length is a knowledge requirement and depends on the angular size of the targets of interest; it is generally at a level of half a meter for typical stellar targets, decreasing to perhaps a few centimeters only for the widest attainable fields of view.

40|$|This paper {{details the}} {{development}} of the Rocky Flats Integrated Closure <b>Project</b> <b>Baseline</b> - an innovative project management effort undertaken to ensure proactive management of the Rocky Flats Closure Contract in support of the Department's goal for achieving the safe closure of the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS) in December 2006. The accelerated closure of RFETS {{is one of the most}} prominent projects within the Department of Energy (DOE) Environmental Management program. As the first major former weapons plant to be remediated and closed, it is a first-of-kind effort requiring the resolution of multiple complex technical and institutional challenges.

40|$|Aims. The aim of {{this study}} is to enhance our {{knowledge}} of the characteristics and distribution of the circumstellar dust associated with the individual components of the young hierarchical triple system T Tau. Methods. To reach this goal, observations in the N-band (8 - 13 µm) with the two-telescope interferometric instrument MIDI at the VLTI were performed. For the northern component of the T Tau system, <b>projected</b> <b>baseline</b> lengths of 43 m, 62 m, and 85 m were used. For the southern binary <b>projected</b> <b>baseline</b> lengths of equivalent resolution could be utilised. Our study is based on both the interferometric and the spectrophotometric measurements and is supplemented by new visual and infrared photometry. Also, the phases were investigated to determine the dominating mid-infrared source in the close southern binary. The data were fit with the help of a sophisticated physical disc model. This model utilises the radiative transfer code MC 3 D that is based on the Monte-Carlo method. Results. Extended mid-infrared emission is found around all three components of the system. Simultaneous fits to the photometric and interferometric data confirm the picture of an almost face-on circumstellar disc around T Tau N. Towards this star, the silicate band is seen in emission. This emission feature is used to model the dust content of the circumstellar disc. Clear signs of dus...|$|R
40|$|We present new {{mid-infrared}} interferometric {{observations of}} the massive young stellar object IRAS 13481 - 6124, using VLTI/MIDI for spectrally-resolved, long-baseline measurements (<b>projected</b> <b>baselines</b> up to ∼ 120 m) and GSO/T-ReCS for aperture-masking interferometry in five narrow-band filters (<b>projected</b> <b>baselines</b> of ∼ 1. 8 - 6. 4 m) in the wavelength range of 7. 5 - 13 μm. We combine these measurements with previously-published interferometric observations in the K and N bands in order to assemble the largest collection of infrared interferometric observations for a massive YSO to date. Using a combination of geometric and radiative-transfer models, we confirm the detection at mid-infrared wavelengths of the disk previously inferred from near-infrared observations. We show that the outflow cavity is also detected at both near- and mid-infrared wavelengths, and in fact dominates the mid-infrared emission in terms of total flux. For the disk, we derive the inner radius (∼ 1. 8 mas or ∼ 6. 5 AU at 3. 6 kpc), temperature at the inner rim (∼ 1760 K), inclination (∼ 48 deg) and position angle (∼ 107 deg). We determine that {{the mass of the}} disk cannot be constrained without high-resolution observations in the (sub-) millimeter regime or {{observations of the}} disk kinematics, and could be anywhere from ∼ 10 ^- 3 to 20 M_.
