5|$|In May 1741, Linnaeus was {{appointed}} Professor of Medicine at Uppsala University, first {{with responsibility for}} medicine-related matters. Soon, he changed <b>place</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> other Professor of Medicine, Nils Rosén, and thus {{was responsible for the}} Botanical Garden (which he would thoroughly reconstruct and expand), botany and natural history, instead.

5|$|Misterioso was {{released}} in 1958 by Riverside Records to a mixed critical reaction; reviewers complimented Monk's performance but were critical of Griffin, whose playing they felt was out of <b>place</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> quartet.

5|$|Aside {{from the}} rare solid-colored horse (usually bay or black), most Lipizzans are gray. Like all gray horses, they have black skin, dark eyes, and as adult horses, a white hair coat. Gray horses, {{including}} Lipizzans, are born darkusually bay or blackand become lighter each {{year as the}} graying process takes <b>place,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> process being complete at between 6 and 10 years of age. Lipizzans are not actually true white horses, {{but this is a}} common misconception. A white horse is born white and has unpigmented skin.|$|E

5|$|At the 2002 World Equestrian Games, riding Krack C, she {{finished}} 11th individually and rode to 5th <b>place</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Dutch team. Her best finish {{was at the}} 2006 Games, riding Salinero, where she won an individual gold and two silvers, one individually and one team. At the 2010 Games, after her top horse Salinero was injured and second-best horse Painted Black was sold, she competed {{as part of the}} Dutch reining team, marking a major change in discipline. Riding Whizashiningwalla BB, she was eliminated in the qualifying rounds. At the Games, she also performed a reining demonstration at the presentation of the team dressage medal and participated in an exhibition of freestyle reining. Van Grunsven began riding reining horses around 2000, but only became a serious competitor in the sport after the 2008 Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Basing {{himself on}} revised data, Sampson in 1995 {{estimated}} that the layers investigated represented {{a longer period of}} time than the initially assumed 500,000 years: after the deposition of Gilmore's Brachyceratops quarry, 860,000 years would have passed, and after the Einiosaurus beds 640,000 years, until the maximal extent of the Bearpaw transgression. He did not adopt Horner's hypothesis of anagenesis but assumed speciation took <b>place,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> populations splitting. These time intervals were still short enough to indicate that the rate of speciation must have been high, which might have been true of all centrosaurines of the late Campanian.|$|E

5|$|Ford reappears in the {{official}} novel continuation Stargate Atlantis Legacy: The Third Path. To their surprise, the team finds Ford alive and {{with a group of}} nomadic humans known as the Travelers. He explains to Sheppard he managed to escape the hive ship before it was destroyed, but crashed on the planet over which the battle took <b>place.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> help of the Travelers, he recovered from his addiction but it took so long that he could no longer find Atlantis afterwards. Ford began leading a guerilla campaign against the Wraith, aided by the Travelers. He also now has a wife and son and regrets his previous actions under the Wraith enzyme.

5|$|He {{also played}} in the Taranaki side that was only {{narrowly}} beaten by the touring Australians in 1913. His form in these games earned him a <b>place</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> All Blacks. On 6September 1913, he {{played in the}} 30–5 first test win over Australia at Athletic Park: Albert Downing and George Sellars played alongside him and were also later killed in action in the First World War. Dewar was then selected, along with four other Taranaki players, for the tour of North America, playing in 14 of the 16 games, including the 51–3 victory over the All America team for his second test cap. He received particular mention in the test match for a cunning dummy pass to Downing on his right, drawing the defence and passing to five-eighths McKenzie on his left to run in for a try. He scored just one try. There was little interest in the American press about the tour. A single short paragraph in the New-York Tribune reports on the 51–3 defeat of the USA team on 15November.|$|E
5|$|Ilona turned south, {{and later}} south-southeast, on 15December {{and began a}} steady {{approach}} to Western Australia. Slight intensification took <b>place,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> cyclone achieving its peak strength around 00:00UTC on 17December with ten-minute sustained winds of 130km/h (80mph) and a barometric pressure of 960hPa (mbar; 28.35inHg). The JTWC estimated Ilona to be slightly stronger, with maximum one-minute sustained winds of 155km/h (100mph)—a Category2-equivalent on the SSHS. That day, Ilona passed near the North Rankin gas platform. Around 16:00UTC, the eye of Ilona made landfall near Mardie Station. Around 16:30UTC, the center of Ilona passed over the town, with a five minute period of calm observed. An eye passage was also reported in Fortescue Roadhouse. The cyclone rapidly decayed as it accelerated inland, falling below tropical cyclone strength by 00:00UTC on 19December, at which time it was situated northeast of Meekatharra. Thereafter, the decaying low turned east and ultimately dissipated later that day {{just west of the}} Western Australia–South Australia border.|$|E

5|$|In the 1982 season, Mouton {{finished}} {{a close second}} overall to Walter Röhrl, after wins in Portugal, Brazil and Greece, and helped Audi to its first manufacturers' title.

In 1985, she won the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in the United States, setting a record time in the process. In 1986, she moved to Peugeot and won the German Rally Championship as the first female driver {{to win a major}} championship in rallying. Soon after securing the title, Mouton retired from rallying due to the ban of Group B supercars. In 1988, she co-founded the international motorsport event Race of Champions in memory of her former rival Henri Toivonen. Mouton became the first president of the FIA's Women & Motor Sport Commission in 2010 and the FIA's manager in the World Rally Championship in 2011.|$|E
