She was therefore fortunate enough {{to be part of}} the early development of systematic review methods. In particular, with colleagues including Mike Clarke and later Jayne Tierney, she helped establish the methods and practical approaches of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of individual <b>participant</b> <b>data</b> (IPD). Stewart and Clarke were amongst the founding members of the Cochrane Collaboration and in 1993 Stewart, Clarke and Tierney established the Cochrane IPD meta-analysis methods group.|$|E

50|$|Individual <b>participant</b> <b>data</b> (also {{known as}} {{individual}} patient data, often abbreviated IPD) {{is a type}} of meta-analysis in which data is collected line-by-line from each patient in the studies being analyzed. Due to the high level of precision and consistency this approach allows for (which in turn makes it easier for researchers to minimize heterogeneity), it is considered the gold standard of meta-analyses. The other type of meta-analysis relies not on IPD but on aggregate data (AD). Although the AD approach is more traditional, in the 21st century, meta-analyses conducted with IPD (also known as IPD meta-analyses) have become increasingly popular. IPD meta-analyses tend to be for large-scale and international projects, and they are less limited than AD meta-analyses in terms of the availability and quality of data they can use. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) has stated that sharing of deidentified individual <b>participant</b> <b>data</b> is an ethical obligation.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of stimulus (reinforcer) variation in several different contexts. In Study 1, we identified high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) stimuli based on results of a paired-stimulus assessment and {{examined the}}ir effects when available under concurrent-reinforcement schedules for 8 participants. No participants showed preference for the LQ stimuli when compared singly or in a varied arrangement to the HQ stimulus. In Study 2, we identified nonpreferred (NP) stimuli based on results of a single-stimulus assessment and examined their effects when available under single-reinforcement schedules for 3 participants. Results of Study 2 were mixed. One <b>participant’s</b> <b>data</b> indicated that the varied presentation of NP stimuli produced a modest improvement in performance over that observed when the stimuli were presented singly. By contrast, a second <b>participant’s</b> <b>data</b> showed no facilitative effect for the varied delivery of NP stimuli and that the inclusion of an HQ stimulus in the varied arrangement obscured the reinforcing effects of the HQ stimulus. The 3 rd <b>participant’s</b> <b>data</b> showed no effect for the varied delivery of NP stimuli but an apparent facilitative effect when an HQ stimulus was included in the varied arrangement, which was attributable solely to the presence of the HQ stimulus...|$|R

50|$|Careful {{design of}} the {{analysis}} one plans to perform, prior to collecting the data, means the analysis choice is not affected by the data collected. Alternatively, one might decide to perfect the classification {{on one or two}} participants, and then use the analysis on the remaining <b>participant</b> <b>data.</b> Regarding the selection of classification parameters, a common method is to divide the data into two sets, and find the optimum parameter using one set and then test using this parameter value on the second set. This is a standard technique used (for example) by the princeton MVPA classification library.|$|E

50|$|NDAR's Ongoing Study {{capability}} allows {{investigators to}} work collaboratively on research studies in progress; sharing data, tools, and standards through the NDAR portal {{before they are}} shared {{with the rest of}} the ASD community. Qualified researchers can also request access to data stored in NDAR and/or data stored at federated repositories, after the data are made public. To gain access to that data, an investigator must obtain NDAR data access privileges. By default, all data contained in NDAR has passed data validation ensuring that all research <b>participant</b> <b>data</b> has an NDAR GUID, conforms to the NDAR data standard, and meets standard value constraints. Beginning with the January 2011 submissions, NDAR developed and implemented automated quality procedures that are run against all incoming data to check for a variety of potential data discrepancies such as duplicate data, uniformity of gender, age consistency across measures, and scoring errors on a number of measures. Not only will the new QA procedures make NDAR-residing data of higher quality, but will increase data accuracy across each individual laboratory and project.|$|E

Background Traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (tNSAIDs) and newer selective cyclo-oxygenase- 2 inhibitors (coxibs) are widely used for analgesia, but they have potentially serious vascular and gastrointestinal risks. A meta-analysis of tabular data from randomised trials of at least 4 weeks ’ duration involving a coxib versus placebo, or a coxib versus a traditional NSAID, has provided some limited information about the risk of vascular events associated with these drugs. 1 Although this has been used by regulatory authorities in informing treatment choices for the public, a meta-analysis of individual <b>participant</b> <b>data</b> from these trials would be substantially more informative.
