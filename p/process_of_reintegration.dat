40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 ’s, the Great Lakes Region (GLR) has been devastated {{by a wave}} of {{interconnected}} interstate, intrastate, and local conflicts involving {{hundreds of thousands of}} soldiers in dozens of armed groups. An important part of the international community’s approach to peacebuilding in the region has involved the disarmament, demobilization, and <b>reintegration</b> (DDR) <b>of</b> armed groups. Because of the transnational nature of many armed groups in the GLR, a regional approach to DDR has been adopted. The World Banks Multi-Country Reintegration Program (MDRP) and Transitional Demobilization and Reintegration Program (TDRP) have been key institutions involved in facilitating national efforts for the demobilization and <b>reintegration</b> <b>of</b> ex-combatants across the region. While DDR has evolved considerably since 1990 ’s, the reintegration component remains among the cruxes. One reason for the enduring challenge <b>of</b> <b>reintegration</b> is that while technical approaches to the delivery <b>of</b> <b>reintegration</b> programming have become ever more refined, the nature of the social and economic reintegration processes that reintegration programs aim to affect in individual ex-combatants have remained largely unproblematized. The mixed track record of DDR programs in the GLR, and around the world, speaks to the idea that without a deep understanding of the endogenous social and economic <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>reintegration,</b> reintegration programs might risk becoming detached from the outcomes they mean to affect. Through the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) <b>of</b> <b>reintegration</b> programming in the GLR, the TDRP has collected vast amounts of social and economic survey data on ex-combatants and community members. Previously, this data has been used to evaluate the extent <b>of</b> <b>reintegration</b> programming impacts in specific country contexts. However, in 2013 the TDRP merged a series of survey datasets that include the experiences of nearly 10, 000 ex-combatants and community members from across five GLR countries (Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, DRC, and RoC) captured between 2010 and 2012. The merged TDRP-GLR Reintegration Dataset opens the door to the systematic comparative analysis of the social and economic reintegration processes that individual ex-combatants navigate across GLR. In examining the social and economic processes through which individual ex-combatants across the GLR reintegrate, this doctoral thesis explores numerous issues. We investigate the deep set of social and economic disadvantages that ex-combatants carry with them as they attempt to reintegrate, {{and the ways in which}} disadvantages can influence the economic livelihood strategies that ex-combatants pursue as a part <b>of</b> <b>reintegration.</b> In turn, we reflect on the relationship <b>of</b> economic <b>processes</b> to a slower moving set <b>of</b> social <b>processes</b> that revolve around negotiating identity and building social networks. Further, we consider the profound role of gender in shaping individual ex-combatants’ social and economic reintegration experiences. Based on this set of insights about some of the underlying social and economic processes that ex-combatants across the GLR navigate during reintegration, we move to reflect more broadly about the direct implications for our understanding of the potential role <b>of</b> <b>reintegration</b> programming in shaping post-conflict societies, and how we understand the successes and failures <b>of</b> <b>reintegration</b> programming through M&E...|$|R

Mission main task was to monitor demilitarization and ensure peaceful reintegration of the territory into Croatia. UN Secretary General initially proposed that UNTAES should have 9,300 soldiers. The final agreement mission had a military and a civilian component with 5,000 soldiers, 500 UNTAES civilian police (UNCIVPOL) and 99 military observers. Before the arrival of UNTAES troops in region has already been located 1,600 troops from Belgian and Russian Armed Forces under United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia. They were joined by Jordanian and Pakistani mechanized battalions, Ukrainian helicopter gunship and other units. United States took a dominant role in implementation of reintegration process.Strobe Talbott was one of the policy makers who raised the issue of regulation of position of Serbs in Croatia, the most important issue in Croatia-United States relations at the time, while US Ambassador Peter Galbraith organized three meetings with the population of the region in the towns of Vukovar, Beli Manastir and Ilok where he informed local Serbs that they will, regardless of fact that their leaders didn’t inform them on it, indeed became part of Croatia based on Erdut Agreement. He also told them that {{they have the right to}} stay, and live whenever they want in Croatia, be it Zagreb, Osijek, Donji Lapac, Knin or Glina and that ethnic Croats have the right to return to Eastern Slavonia. Madeleine Albright visited Vukovar in early 1996 to express her support to the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>reintegration</b> where she was attacked with eggs and stones at local market. Initial headquarters was located at United Nations Protection Force headquarters in Zagreb but idea of mission personnel was to put headquarters in eastern Croatia. Croatian Government offered Osijek for that purpose but mission refused it since it wanted to locate it on the territory of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia. Therefore, the headquarters were located in Vukovar, with a liaison office in Beli Manastir, which provided UNTAES civil affairs officers with the opportunity to attend sessions of local Serb Executive Councils and assemblies which facilitated exchange of relevant information. One of the challenges mission faced was tense and peaceful retake of Đeletovci oil fields from the control of Scorpions paramilitary. Representatives of mission urged ambassadors from Zagreb to visit region and additionally introduced practice of visiting of the local Serbian orthodox churches and two Catholic churches that still were in operation.|$|E

Permanent exclusion rates in this LEA mirrored national figures at the time the project began. Review of the literature revealed that although plenty had been written about exclusion, relatively little existed in the literature concerning the return of permanently excluded pupils to new schools. Of the small body of literature that did exist, much was found to be speculative.

In addition, the re-emergence of older cultural and social patterns such as cultural nationalism and religious sentiments is remarkable. There now is no choice but to call into question much received wisdom about existing socialism. The modernist pretentions of Stalinism enjoy no credibility and, more generally, much of what has been constructed in the East under existing socialism must be rejected.
