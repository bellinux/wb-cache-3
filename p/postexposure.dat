50|$|While canine-specific rabies {{does not}} {{circulate}} among dogs, {{about a hundred}} dogs become infected from other wildlife {{per year in the}} US. Rabies is common among wild animals in the United States. Bats, raccoons, skunks and foxes account for almost all reported cases (98% in 2009). Rabid bats are found in all 48 contiguous states. Other reservoirs are more limited geographically; for example, the raccoon rabies virus variant is only found in a relatively narrow band along the East Coast. Due to a high public awareness of the virus, efforts at vaccination of domestic animals and curtailment of feral populations, and availability of <b>postexposure</b> prophylaxis, incidents of rabies in humans are very rare. A total of 49 cases of the disease was reported in the country between 1995 and 2011; of these, 11 are thought to have been acquired abroad. Almost all domestically acquired cases are attributed to bat bites.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the rhesus macaque application, SNALPs have also been proven to protect cavia porcellua from viremia and death when administered shortly after <b>postexposure</b> to ZEBOV. A polymerase (L) gene-specific siRNAs delivery system was imposed upon four genes associated with the viral genomic RNA in the ribonucleoprotein complex found within EBOV particles (three of which match the application above): NP, VP30, VP35, and the L protein. The SNALPs ranged from 71 - 84 nm in size and were composed of synthetic cholesterol, phospholipid DSPC, PEG lipid PEGC-DMA, and cationic lipid DLinDMA at the molar ratio of 48:20:2:30. [...] The results confirm complete protection against viremia and death in guinea pigs when administered a SNALP-siRNA delivery system after diagnosis of the Ebola virus, thus proving this technology {{to be an effective}} treatment. Future studies will focus mainly upon evaluating the effects of siRNA ‘cocktails’ on EBOV genes to increase antiviral effects.|$|E
5000|$|Rabies was {{considered}} a scourge for its prevalence in the 19th century. In France and Belgium, where Saint Hubert was venerated, the [...] "St Hubert's Key" [...] was heated and applied to cauterize the wound. By an application of magical thinking, dogs were branded with the key in hopes of protecting them from rabies. The fear of rabies was almost irrational, due {{to the number of}} vectors (mostly rabid dogs) and the absence of any efficacious treatment. It was not uncommon for a person bitten by a dog but merely suspected of being rabid to commit suicide or to be killed by others. This gave Louis Pasteur ample opportunity to test <b>postexposure</b> treatments from 1885.In ancient times, the attachment of the tongue (the lingual frenulum, a mucous membrane) was cut and removed as this was where rabies was thought to originate. This practice ceased with the discovery of the actual cause of rabies.|$|E
5000|$|At the 8th Vaccine and ISV Conference in Philadelphia on 27−28 October 2014, Novavax Inc. {{reported}} the {{development in a}} [...] "few weeks" [...] of a glycoprotein (GP) nanoparticle Ebola virus (EBOV GP) vaccine using their proprietary recombinant technology. A recombinant protein is a protein whose code is carried by recombinant DNA. The vaccine {{is based on the}} newly published genetic sequence of the 2014 Guinea Ebola (Makona) strain that is responsible for the current Ebola disease epidemic in West Africa. In animal studies, a useful immune response was induced, and was found to be enhanced ten to a hundred-fold by the company's [...] "Matrix-M" [...] immunologic adjuvant. A study of the response of non-human primate to the vaccine had been initiated. As of February 2015, Novavax had completed 2 primate studies on baboons and macaques and had initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in Australia.

50|$|The {{mortality}} {{of the disease}} in 1909, as recorded in the British Army and Navy stationed in Malta, was 2%. The most frequent {{cause of death was}} endocarditis. Recent advances in antibiotics and surgery have been successful in preventing death due to endocarditis. Prevention of human brucellosis can be achieved by eradication of the disease in animals by vaccination and other veterinary control methods such as testing herds/flocks and slaughtering animals when infection is present. Currently, no effective vaccine is available for humans. Boiling milk before consumption, or before using it to produce other dairy products, is protective against transmission via ingestion. Changing traditional food habits of eating raw meat, liver, or bone marrow is necessary, but difficult to implement. Patients who have had brucellosis should probably be excluded indefinitely from donating blood or organs. Exposure of diagnostic laboratory personnel to Brucella organisms remains a problem in both endemic settings and when brucellosis is unknowingly imported by a patient. After appropriate risk assessment, staff with significant exposure should be offered <b>postexposure</b> prophylaxis and followed up serologically for six months. Recently published experience confirms that prolonged and frequent serological follow-up consumes significant resources without yielding much information, and is burdensome for the affected staff, who often fail to comply. The side effects of the usual recommended regimen of rifampicin and doxycycline for three weeks also reduce treatment adherence. As no evidence shows treatment with two drugs is superior to monotherapy, British guidelines now recommend doxycycline alone for three weeks and a less onerous follow-up protocol.|$|E

Forty-five adult female rats were exposed at two sites over the left lung to 3. 1 -MHz superthreshold pulsed ultrasound. The repair of lung lesions was evaluated from 0 through 44 days <b>postexposure.</b> Macroscopic lesions at 0 days <b>postexposure</b> were large bright red ellipses of hemorrhage. By 1 and 3 days <b>postexposure,</b> lesions {{were the same}} size and dark red to red-black, but, by 3 days <b>postexposure,</b> lesions had a raised surface appearance. From 5 to 10 days <b>postexposure,</b> lesions grew smaller in size, progressed from red-gray to yellow-brown, and retained a raised surface appearance. From 13 through 44 days <b>postexposure,</b> lesions gradually decreased in size, had a faint yellow-brown discoloration, and gradually lost the raised surface appearance. By 37 and 44 days <b>postexposure,</b> lung returned to near normal morphology, but had small areas of light yellow-brown discoloration in the areas where lung was exposed. Microscopic lesions at 0 and 1 days <b>postexposure</b> were areas of acute alveolar hemorrhage. By 3 days <b>postexposure,</b> lesions had loss of alveolar erythrocytes and the formation of hemoglobin crystals.

An inexpensive and easy-to-use assay chamber was designed. A sediment toxicity assay was successfully performed at a lentic system impacted by acid mine drainage, at sites with different types of sediment. It consisted of a 48 -h exposure period followed by a 1 -h <b>postexposure</b> feeding during which the larvae were fed on Artemia franciscana nauplii. Methodologies for feeding quantification of fourth-instar larvae (10 -d old) were first developed and optimized under laboratory conditions. A. franciscana nauplii were shown to be more suited than fish flake food for <b>postexposure</b> feeding quantification, allowing higher precision {{and cost-effective}}ness. It also required a shorter <b>postexposure</b> feeding period, thus minimizing the chances for an eventual organism physiological recovery from toxicant exposure. The influence of several environmental conditions during exposure on <b>postexposure</b> feeding was also evaluated: temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, salinity, hardness, substrate, humic acids, light, and food availability. Only temperature was found to significantly influence <b>postexposure</b> feeding rates; exposure at 5 °C led to reduced feeding activity compared to 30 °C. Recovery rates of 87 % were obtained after the 48 -h field exposure at all sites (except site R 2). A statistically significant <b>postexposure</b> feeding depression was observed at the three sites impacted by acid mine drainage.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Altered {{patterns}} of gene expression mediate {{the effects of}} particulate matter (PM) on human health, but mechanisms through which PM modifies gene expression are largely undetermined. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved, noncoding small RNAs that regulate the expression of broad gene networks at the posttranscriptional level. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the effects of exposure to PM and PM metal components on candidate miRNAs (miR- 222, miR- 21, and miR- 146 a) related with oxidative stress and inflammatory processes in 63 workers at an electric-furnace steel plant. METHODS: We measured miR- 222, miR- 21, and miR- 146 a expression in blood leukocyte RNA {{on the first day}} of a workweek (baseline) and after 3 days of work (<b>postexposure).</b> Relative expression of miRNAs was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. We measured blood oxidative stress (8 -hydroxyguanine) and estimated individual exposures to PM 1 (< 1 microm in aerodynamic diameter), PM 10 (< 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter), coarse PM (PM 10 minus PM 1), and PM metal components (chromium, lead, cadmium, arsenic, nickel, manganese) between the baseline and <b>postexposure</b> measurements. RESULTS: Expression of miR- 222 and miR- 21 (using the 2 -DeltaDeltaCT method) was significantly increased in <b>postexposure</b> samples (miR- 222 : baseline = 0. 68 +/- 3. 41, <b>postexposure</b> = 2. 16 +/- 2. 25, p = 0. 002; miR- 21 : baseline = 4. 10 +/- 3. 04, <b>postexposure</b> = 4. 66 +/- 2. 63, p = 0. 05). In <b>postexposure</b> samples, miR- 222 expression was positively correlated with lead exposure (beta = 0. 41, p = 0. 02), whereas miR- 21 expression was associated with blood 8 -hydroxyguanine (beta = 0. 11, p = 0. 03) but not with individual PM size fractions or metal components. <b>Postexposure</b> expression of miR- 146 a was not significantly different from baseline (baseline = 0. 61 +/- 2. 42, <b>postexposure</b> = 1. 90 +/- 3. 94, p = 0. 19) but was negatively correlated with exposure to lead (beta = - 0. 51, p = 0. 011) and cadmium (beta = - 0. 42, p = 0. 04).

40|$|Eradication of {{smallpox}} and discontinuation of the vaccination campaign {{resulted in an}} increase in the percentage of unvaccinated individuals, highlighting the need for <b>postexposure</b> efficient countermeasures in case of accidental or deliberate viral release. Intranasal infection of mice with ectromelia virus (ECTV), a model for human smallpox, is curable by vaccination with a high vaccine dose given up to 3 days <b>postexposure.</b> To further extend this protective window and to reduce morbidity, mice were vaccinated <b>postexposure</b> with Vaccinia-Lister, the conventional smallpox vaccine or Modified Vaccinia Ankara, a highly attenuated vaccine in conjunction with TLR 3 or TLR 9 agonists. We show that co-administration of the TLR 3 agonist poly(I:C) even 5 days <b>postexposure</b> conferred protection, avoiding the need to increase the vaccination dose. Efficacious treatments prevented death, ameliorated disease symptoms, reduced viral load and maintained tissue integrity of target organs. Protection was associated with significant elevation of serum IFNa and anti-vaccinia IgM antibodies, modulation of IFNc response, and balanced activation of NK and T cells. TLR 9 agonists (CpG ODNs) were less protective than the TLR 3 agonist poly(I:C).

The median lethal concentration (LC 50) was 1. 46 mg/L UIA at 24 and 48 h <b>postexposure,</b> 1. 33 mg/ L at 72 h <b>postexposure,</b> and 0. 98 mg/L at 96 h <b>postexposure.</b> No mortalities were noted in unexposed (0 mg/ L) control fish or fish exposed to 0. 5 mg/L UIA. However, 93 – 100 % mortalities were observed within 24 h among fish exposed to 2. 0, 3. 0, or 4. 0 mg/L UIA. In additional UIA exposure experiments, Nile tilapia were exposed to sublethal concentrations (0. 32 – 0. 37 mg/L UIA) for 24 h and then administered an intraperitoneal injection with 750 colony-forming units (CFU) of Streptococcus agalactiae per fish.
