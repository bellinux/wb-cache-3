We obtain new algorithms {{on the basis}} of a Potts neural network for coherent mapping, and we remodel the Durbin algorithm and the Kohonen algorithm with mean field annealing. The resulting dimension-reducing mappings possess a highly reliable topology preservation such that the nearby elements in the parameter space are ordered as similarly as possible on the cortex-like map, and the objective function costs between eighboring cortical points are as smooth as possible. The proposed Potts neural network contains two sets of interactive dynamics for two kinds of mappings, one from the parameter space to the cortical space and the other in the reverse way. We present a theoretical <b>pproach</b> <b>to</b> developing self-organizing algorithms with a novel decision principle for competitive l arning.

40|$|As we have {{developed}} a number of authoring systems for simulation-centered tutorial development, each successive authoring system has achieved its original goals, and yet has been quickly shown to have limitations that motivated the next authoring system. The history of these systems reveals two emerging requirement themes. The first theme {{is that there is}} a need for more than one level of tutor development. For example, a two-level authoring system might provide an easy-to-use system tbr novice tutor developers and a deeper level of authoring for expert tutor developers.

40|$|Abstract [...] Recent pedological {{evidence}} of the widespread istribution of beidellites in soils indicates {{the need for a}} greater knowledge of the effect of charge location on the microstructural organization of Na § smectite in gels. After equilibration at a suction pressure of 3. 2 kPa before and after desiccation, TEM observations showed large differences between abeidellite and both a low and high charge montmorillonite. Monolayers were rare; individual ayers were instead organized in particles with larger interparticle distances. This has implication for theories relating swelling pressures to interlayer distances or surface areas and implies the need for a geometrical <b>pproach</b> <b>to</b> the study of swelling in smectites. Location of isomorphous substitution i the tetrahedral sheet of smectites results in an increased lateral extension of overlapping layers. This was reflected in a greater capacity to rehydrate after desiccation. Increased number of layers in particles were found with increasing surface charge density. The geometric organization of the particles is critical to the understanding ofthe ability of Na + smectite to hold water against an applied suction...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Ground {{penetrating}} radar (GPR) is {{a suitable}} technique for imaging sedimentary {{structures in the}} vadose zone because small texture-related capillary-pressure variations lead to changes in water content and electromagnetic properties. To study exactly how GPR reflections are generated by sedimentary structures, GPR profiles of an aeolian sedimentary succession are combined with measurements of textural, electromagnetic and water-retention characteristics fi'om a trench. Time domain reflectometry indicates that small variations in texture in the high-angle dune sediment are associated with changes in water content. Synthetic modelling shows that these changes cause clear GPR reflections. In an experimental <b>pproach</b> <b>to</b> estimate the radar esponse of structures below the wave resolution, i. e. features smaller than h/ 4, variations in grain-size distribution and porosity in a thin section were used to reconstruct water-retention curves and impedance models of the thinly layered sediment. Synthetic radar records calculated from the impedance models show that reflections from the studied subcentimetre-scale structures are composites ofinterfering signals. Although these low-amplitude interfering signals will com-monly be overprinted by more prominent reflections, they may cause reflection patterns that change with frequency and do not represent primary bedding...|$|R
40|$|Providing packet-level {{quality of}} service (QoS) is {{critical}} to support both rate-sensitive and delay-sensitive applications in the bandwidth-constrained, shared-channel, multihop wireless networks. This problem is challenging due to the unique issues such as location-dependent contention, inherent conflict between ensuring fairness and maximizing channel utilization, and the distributed nature of packet scheduling in such networks. In order to address these issues, we have taken a new self-organizing approach to QoS solutions for such networks. In this approach, local decision makers self-organize themselves and coordinate among one another, and collectively achieve the desired global property. Some features of our approach include fully localized design, coordination among local decision makers, intentional and optimized information propagation, scaling property and achievable global property. Two key contributions of this work are: (a) a model-referenced self-organizing design methodology for multihop wireless networks; and (b) a table-driven approach and a backoff-based a <b>pproach</b> <b>to</b> distributed packet scheduling that provides QoS performance bounds in terms of fairness, throughput and delay, maximizes channel spatial reuse, and arbitrates the conict between fairness and maximal channel utilization.
