5|$|Common {{responses}} include: <b>pupil</b> <b>dilation</b> (93%); {{changes in}} heart rate (100%), including increases (56%), decreases (13%), and variable responses (31%); changes {{in blood pressure}} (84%), including hypotension (34%), hypertension (28%), and general instability (22%); changes in stretch reflex (86%), including increases (80%) and decreases (6%); nausea (44%); tremor (25%); and dysmetria (16%) (inability to properly direct or limit motions). The temporary increases in blood pressure caused by the drug can be {{a risk factor for}} users with pre-existing hypertension. These qualitative somatic effects caused by psilocybin have been corroborated by several early clinical studies. A 2005 magazine survey of club goers in the UK found that nausea or vomiting was experienced by over a quarter of those who had used psilocybin mushrooms in the last year, although this effect is caused by the mushroom rather than psilocybin itself. In one study, administration of gradually increasing dosages of psilocybin daily for 21 days had no measurable effect on electrolyte levels, blood sugar levels, or liver toxicity tests.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of {{pinnipeds}} {{are relatively}} large for {{their size and}} are positioned {{near the front of}} the head. One exception is the walrus, whose smaller eyes are located on the sides of its head. This is because it feeds on immobile bottom dwelling mollusks and hence does not need acute vision. A seal's eye is adapted for seeing both underwater and in air. The lens is mostly spherical, and much of the retina is equidistant from the lens center. The cornea has a flattened center where refraction is nearly equal in both water and air. Pinnipeds also have very muscular and vascularized irises. The well-developed dilator muscle gives the animals a great range in <b>pupil</b> <b>dilation.</b> When contracted, the pupil is typically pear-shaped, although the bearded seal's is more diagonal. In species that live in shallow water, such as harbor seals and California sea lions, dilation varies little, while the deep-diving elephant seals have much greater variation.|$|E
40|$|Emotional prosody {{provides}} important cues {{for understanding}} the emotions of others in every day communication. Asperger 2 ̆ 7 s syndrome (AS) is a developmental disorder characterised by pronounced deficits in socio-emotional communication, including difficulties {{in the domain of}} prosody processing. We measured pupillary responses as an index of emotional prosodic processing when 15 participants with AS and 19 non-clinical control participants listened to positive, negative and neutral prosodic sentences. This occurred under a spontaneous and an explicit task instruction. In the explicit processing condition, the AS group and the non-clinical controls showed increased <b>pupil</b> <b>dilations</b> to positively and negatively intoned sentences when judging the valence of that prosodic sentence. This suggests higher processing demands for emotionally arousing information, as the effect was not found in comparison to neutrally intoned sentences. In the spontaneous processing condition, controls also responded with increased <b>pupil</b> <b>dilations</b> to positively intoned sentences, whilst individuals with AS showed increased <b>pupil</b> <b>dilations</b> to negative sentences. The latter result is further supported by diminished ratings of emotionally intense sentences in the AS group compared to healthy controls. Perception and recognition of positively valenced sentences in individuals with AS appears impaired and dependent on the general task set-up. Diminished <b>pupil</b> <b>dilations</b> in spontaneous positive processing conditions as well as reduced positive valence ratings give strong indications for a general negative processing bias of verbal information for adult individuals diagnosed with AS...|$|R
40|$|Speech {{comprehension}} in adverse {{listening conditions}} can be effortful even when speech is fully intelligible. Acoustical distortions typically make speech comprehension more effortful, but effort {{also depends on}} linguistic aspects of the speech signal, such as its syntactic complexity. In the present study, <b>pupil</b> <b>dilations</b> and subjective effort ratings were recorded in 20 normal-hearing participants while performing a sentence comprehension task. The sentences were either syntactically simple (subject-first sentence structure) or complex (object-first sentence structure) and were presented in two levels of background noise both corresponding to high intelligibility. A digit span and a reading span test {{were used to assess}} individual differences in the participants' working memory capacity. The results showed that the subjectively rated effort was mostly affected by the noise level and less by syntactic complexity. Conversely, <b>pupil</b> <b>dilations</b> increased with syntactic complexity but only showed a small effect of the noise level. Participants with higher working memory capacity showed increased pupil responses in the higher-level noise condition but rated sentence comprehension as being less effortful compared to participants with lower working memory capacity. Overall, the results demonstrate that <b>pupil</b> <b>dilations</b> and subjectively rated effort represent different aspects of effort. Furthermore, the results indicate that effort can vary in situations with high speech intelligibility...|$|R

5|$|For the game's {{character}} sculpting and rigging, {{the team}} introduced various new elements {{that were not}} used in their previous games. Lead character technical director Judd Simantov found {{that the creation of}} the faces was the most challenging, in terms of hardware. For the faces, the team used joint-based facial rigs, with some blend-shape correctives. To reta{{in the shape of the}} face and avoid awkward movement, the faces were rigged with the mouth open and eyes slightly closed. The faces were also based on the Facial Action Coding System, allowing for an anatomical-based approach. The use of a higher mesh density also allowed more volumes and creasing in the shape of the face, creating cleaner silhouettes and shapes and giving enough geometry to sculpt correctives. In an attempt to add subtle features, <b>pupil</b> <b>dilation</b> was added to the character models. For the bodies, the team edited the character movements from Uncharted 2, softening some joint alignment. The animation of carpal joints was also added for the game, allowing more dynamic hand shapes, and flexibility. Another subtle addition was the arm mover controls, allowing minor editing on the arms; though this feature was previously available, it was opened up to the animators for The Last of Us. A muscle system was also added, adding muscle shells that bulge, based on attachment joint distance; the muscle system, written in Maya within a few days, works in real time. To solve an issue in which body movement resulted in awkward movement of clothing, runtime helpers were implemented. A total of 326 joints were used in the full character model, with 98 of these in the face; 85 of these are runtime driven, while 241 are locked into animation.|$|E

40|$|When humans {{perform a}} {{response}} task or timing task repeatedly, fluctuations in measures of timing from one action {{to the next}} exhibit long-range correlations known as 1 /f noise. The origins of 1 /f noise in timing have been debated for over twenty years, with one common explanation serving as a default: Humans are composed of physiological processes throughout the brain and body that operate {{over a wide range}} of timescales, and these processes combine to be expressed as a general source of 1 /f noise. To test this explanation, the present study investigated the coupling versus independence of 1 /f noise in timing deviations, key-press durations, <b>pupil</b> <b>dilations,</b> and heartbeat intervals while tapping to an audiovisual metronome. All four dependent measures exhibited clear 1 /f noise, regardless of whether tapping was synchronized or syncopated. 1 /f spectra for timing deviations were found to match those for key-press durations on an individual basis, and 1 /f spectra for <b>pupil</b> <b>dilations</b> matched those in heartbeat intervals. Results indicate a complex, multiscale relationship among 1 /f noises arising from common sources, such as those arising from timing functions versus those arising from autonomic nervous system functions. Results also provide further evidence against the default hypothesis that 1 /f noise in human timing is just the additive combination of processes throughout the brain and body. Our findings are better accommodated by theories of complexity matching that begin to formalize multiscale coordination as a foundation of human behavior...|$|R

40|$|The {{muscles that}} control the pupil are richly innervated by the {{autonomic}} nervous system. While there are central pathways that drive <b>pupil</b> <b>dilations</b> in relation to arousal, there is no anatomical evidence that cortical centers involved with visual selective attention innervate the pupil. In this study, we show that such connections must exist. Specifically, we demonstrate a novel Pupil Frequency Tagging (PFT) method, where oscillatory changes in stimulus brightness over time are mirrored by <b>pupil</b> constrictions and <b>dilations.</b> We find that the luminance induced pupil oscillations are enhanced when covert attention is directed to the flicker stimulus and when targets are correctly detected in an attentional tracking task.

40|$|Background: Fear {{conditioning}} and extinction are prevailing experimental and etiological models for normal and pathological anxiety. <b>Pupil</b> <b>dilations</b> {{in response to}} conditioned stimuli are increasingly used as a robust psychophysiological readout of fear learning, but their neural correlates remain unknown. We aimed at identifying the neural correlates of pupil responses to threat and safety cues during a fear learning task. Methods: Thirty-four healthy subjects underwent a fear {{conditioning and}} extinction paradigm with simultaneous {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) and pupillometry. After a stringent preprocessing and artifact rejection procedure, trial-wise pupil responses to threat and safety cues were entered as parametric modulations to the fMRI general linear models. Results: Trial-wise magnitude of pupil responses to both conditioned and safety stimuli correlated positively with activity in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), thalamus, supramarginal gyrus and insula for the entire fear learning task, and with activity in the dACC during the fear conditioning phase in particular. Phasic pupil responses did not show habituation, but were negatively correlated with tonic baseline pupil diameter, which decreased during the task. Correcting phasic pupil responses for the tonic baseline pupil diameter revealed thalamic activity, which was also observed in an analysis employing a linear (declining) time modulation. Conclusion: <b>Pupil</b> <b>dilations</b> during fear conditioning and extinction provide useful readouts to track fear learning on a trial-by-trial level, particularly with simultaneous fMRI. Whereas phasic pupil responses reflect activity in brain regions involved in fear learning and threat appraisal, most prominently in dACC, tonic changes in pupil diameter may reflect changes in general arousal...|$|R
