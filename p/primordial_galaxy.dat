40|$|Using highly-accurate N-body simulations, {{we explore}} the {{evolution}} of multiple massive black holes (hereafter, MBHs) in a <b>primordial</b> <b>galaxy</b> that is composed of stars and MBHs. The evolution is pursed with a fourth-order Hermite scheme, where not only three-body interaction of MBHs but also dynamical friction by stars are incorporated. Initially, ten MBHs with equal mass of 10 ^ 7 M_ are set in a host galaxy with 10 ^ 11 M_. It is found that 4 - 6 MBHs merge successively within 1 Gyr, emitting gravitational wave radiation. The key process for the successive merger of MBHs is the dynamical friction by field stars, which enhances three-body interactions of MBHs when they enter the central regions of the galaxy. The heaviest MBH always composes a close binary at the galactic center, which shrinks owing to the angular momentum transfer by the third MBH and eventually merges. The angular momentum transfer by the third MBH {{is due to the}} sling-shot mechanism. We find that the secular Kozai mechanism does not work for a binary to merge if we include the relativistic pericenter shift. The simulations show that a multiple MBH system can produce a heavier MBH at the galactic center purely through N-body process. This merger path can be of great significance for the growth of MBHs in a <b>primordial</b> <b>galaxy.</b> The merger of multiple MBHs may be a potential source of gravitational waves for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and pulsar timing.

From comparisons with photoionization models, we find that the observed line ratios in this nebula are consistent with low metallicity gas (Z < 10 ^- 2 - 10 ^- 3 Z_sun), but that this conclusion depends on the unknown ionization parameter of the system. The large HeII equivalent width (~ 37 +/- 10 A) and the large HeII/Lya ratio (0. 12 +/- 0. 04) suggest that the cloud is being illuminated by a hard ionizing continuum, either an AGN or very low metallicity stars, or perhaps powered by gravitational cooling radiation.

40|$|In massive <b>primordial</b> <b>galaxies,</b> the gas may {{directly}} {{collapse and}} form a single central massive object if cooling is suppressed. H(2) line cooling can be suppressed {{in the presence of}} a strong soft-ultraviolet radiation field, but the role played by other cooling mechanisms is less clear. In optically thin gas, Ly alpha cooling can be very effective, maintaining the gas temperature below 10 (4) K over many orders of magnitude in density. However, the large neutral hydrogen column densities present in <b>primordial</b> <b>galaxies</b> render them highly optically thick to Ly alpha photons. In this paper, we examine in detail the effects of the trapping of these Ly alpha photons on the thermal and chemical evolution of the gas. We show that despite the high optical depth in the Lyman series lines, cooling is not strongly suppressed, and proceeds via other atomic hydrogen transitions. At densities larger than similar to 10 (9) cm(- 3), collisional dissociation of molecular hydrogen becomes the dominant cooling process and decreases the gas temperature to about 5000 K. The gas temperature evolves with density as T proportional to rho(gamma eff- 1), with gamma(eff) = 0. 97 - 0. 98. The evolution is thus very close to isothermal, and so fragmentation is possible, but unlikely to occur during the initial collapse. However, after the formation of a massive central object, we expect that later-infalling, higher angular momentum material will form an accretion disk that may be unstable to fragmentation, which may give rise to star formation with a top-heavy initial mass function...|$|R

First, the cross-correlations of these peaks detected in different filters are strong. Second, their auto-correlation functions indicate that these faint diffuse objects are self-clustered. The subset of objects dark in the F 450 W and F 606 W bandpasses, but bright in F 814 W, also shows stronger correlation compared to the whole dark sample.

From the amplitude {{of the galaxy}} surface brightness fluctuations, we also estimate the number of globular clusters fainter than this cutoff magnitude. The GCLFs of these galaxies are well fitted by Gaussians; the weighted means of their turnover magnitudes and dispersions are 〈 m^ 0 _V〉 = 23. 88 ± 0. 10 mag and 〈σ〉 = 1. 35 ± 0. 07 mag. The assumption of a universal value for the absolute magnitude of the turnover M^ 0 _V places the Fornax cluster 0. 13 ± 0. 11 mag more distant than Virgo. However, {{in light of recent}} Cepheid and other high-precision distance measurements, as well as ongoing HST observations of GCLFs for the purpose of determining the extra-galactic distance scale, we choose to re-examine the universal GCLF hypothesis. Based on data from groups and clusters of galaxies, we find evidence that M^ 0 _V becomes fainter as the local density of galaxies increases.

In this paper we reproduce {{for the first time}} these line features with two different physically motivated kinematic models: an interstellar medium composed by outflowing clumps with random motions and an homogeneous gaseous sphere undergoing solid body rotation. The multiphase model requires a clump velocity dispersion of 54. 3 ± 0. 6 km s^- 1 with outflows of 54. 3 ± 5. 1 km s^- 1, while the bulk rotation velocity is constrained to be 348 ^+ 75 _- 48 km s^- 1.

We find that dust created in the first supernova (SN) explosions can be driven through the interior of the SN remnant to accumulate in the SN shells, where second-generation stars may form from compressed cooling gas. This scenario requires metal-free stars to form continuously over timescales of up to 10 Myr, consistent with recent estimates. Silicate and graphite grains, as well as iron-bearing magnetites, are transported to the shells for reasonable parameter assumptions, but their relative yields from primordial SNe is an important factor in the resulting abundance ratios. We compare the results of segregated grain transport with the current nucleosynthetic data on extremely metal-poor Galactic halo stars. Fossil signatures of this process may already have been detected in those iron-poor stars with enhanced carbon and silicate elements such as magnesium, silicon and oxygen. We discuss the implications of our results for the transition from first- to second-generation star formation in <b>primordial</b> <b>galaxies,</b> and the role played by the radiative transport of dust in this process. Subject headings: cosmology: theory — dust — galaxies: high-redshift — stars:abundances — stars: Population II — supernova remnant 1. introduction The radiative transport of dust and grain history in galaxies have been studied by many authors, generally in the context of our Galaxy (e. g., Draine & Salpeter 1979 a; Dwek & Scalo 1980; Seab & Shull 1983). Although early calculations (Pecker 1972) of this problem indicated that dust transport was difficult to accomplish, Ferrara et al. (1991) found that it was possible to transport dust grains by radiation pressure to large distances from the plane of the disk in a relatively short time (∼ 10 8 yr). In addition, dust destruction mechanisms are important to conside...|$|R

Accreting gas streams provide fuel for star formation, but they stir the disk and increase turbulence above the usual levels compatible with gravitational instability, reducing the star formation efficiency in the available gas. After the specific inflow rate has sufficiently decreased - typically at z 40 %) down to z = 2, in contrast to other galaxy formation models. Idealized hydrodynamic simulations of infalling gas streams onto <b>primordial</b> <b>galaxies</b> confirm the efficient energetic coupling at z > 2, and suggest that this effect is largely under-resolved in existing cosmological simulations.
