5|$|As {{the species}} has no fixed nest sites that {{individuals}} {{can use to}} locate their own partner or chick, emperor <b>penguins</b> must rely on vocal calls alone for identification. They use {{a complex set of}} calls that are critical to individual recognition between parents, offspring, and mates, displaying the widest variation in individual calls of all <b>penguins.</b> Vocalizing emperor <b>penguins</b> use two frequency bands simultaneously. Chicks use a frequency-modulated whistle to beg for food and to contact parents.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} {{appearance}} in the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals, the <b>Penguins</b> had {{less than three weeks}} before free agency began to settle numerous contract decisions.

5|$|Edinburgh Zoo's long {{association}} with <b>penguins</b> began in January 1914, {{with the arrival}} of three king <b>penguins</b> from the Christian Salvesen whaling expedition which docked in Leith. The subsequent successful hatching of a king penguin chick in 1919 was the first penguin to be hatched in captivity. These were the first <b>penguins</b> to be seen outside of the South Atlantic anywhere in the world. The now famous daily penguin parade started by accident in 1950 with the escape of several birds. This proved so popular with visitors and the <b>penguins</b> that it is a daily feature of the zoo today.|$|E

5|$|In Game 6, the Flyers lead 3–0 {{four minutes}} into the second period.

Sergei Gonchar scored his first goal of the series, his first in 23playoff games dating back to game two of the Penguins' first-round series against Ottawa in 2008, to break the tie at 2:19 of the third period. Crosby added an empty-net goal and the <b>Penguins</b> eliminated the Flyers and advance to the Eastern Conference Semifinals. Three days after the <b>Penguins</b> series-clinching victory of the Flyers, the <b>Penguins</b> announced that Head Coach Dan Bylsma had signed a multi-year contract extension with the team.|$|E

5|$|In June 2014 a {{study by}} the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution {{concluded}} that emperor <b>penguins</b> are at risk from global warming, which is melting the sea ice.

Loss of ice reduces the supply of krill, which is a primary food for emperor <b>penguins.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the playoffs, Ottawa's fourth placing in the Conference {{meant that}} the first-round playoff series was against the fifth-seeded Pittsburgh <b>Penguins.</b> Some media were expecting the <b>Penguins</b> to win the series for three reasons—the <b>Penguins</b> had won the season series, the Senators' past playoff {{troubles}} and the strong young talent of the <b>Penguins,</b> particularly young star Sidney Crosby. The Senators, however, won easily by a score of four games to one, including a 3–0 shutout win in Game 5. This was the only series where the Senators were the higher-seeded team.|$|E

5|$|On February 7, 2016, the Florida Panthers' mascot, Stanley C Panther, {{blew his}} nose into a Terrible Towel, with the Pittsburgh <b>Penguins</b> down 0-2 with around 6 mins {{left in the}} 3rd period. After this, the <b>Penguins</b> then tied the game in regulation, and won it in overtime.

Kris Letang scored the OT winner, and Sidney Crosby tied the game with the goaltender pulled late in regulation.

5|$|Roberts did {{not last}} much longer in Florida as, {{following}} a 40-point season in 2005–06, the Panthers sought to trade him to the Pittsburgh <b>Penguins</b> late in the 2006–07 season. Several members of the <b>Penguins,</b> including Mario Lemieux and general manager Ray Shero, sought to convince Roberts {{to agree to the}} deal as he was initially unsure about leaving Florida but ultimately agreed to the trade. The deal was completed at the February 27, 2007, trade deadline as Pittsburgh sent prospect Noah Welch to Florida in exchange for Roberts. He was brought in to add a leadership presence to a young <b>Penguins</b> team.

5|$|Thanks to the zoological society's {{connection}} with the Salvesen family, some of the zoo's first animals were three king <b>penguins,</b> arriving from South Georgia with a Christian Salvesen whaling expedition that docked in Leith in early 1914.

5|$|The Eastern Conference Final began {{between the}} <b>Penguins</b> and the Philadelphia Flyers on May 9. Malkin scored with 7seconds {{left in the}} first period to take a 3–2 lead, and {{extended}} the advantage with a shorthanded goal in the second period, giving the <b>Penguins</b> a 1–0 advantage in the series after Game 1. In Game 2, Talbot scored {{to take the lead in}} the third period, and Staal added an empty-net goal to give the <b>Penguins</b> a 4–2 win and a 2–0 series lead. The win was the Penguins' seventh consecutive home playoff win, a franchise record, improving on a six-game streak in the 1992 playoffs. The <b>Penguins</b> also became only the fifth team to start the playoffs with a 10–1 record, and the first since the Detroit Red Wings in 1995. Game 3 saw the series move across state to Philadelphia; the <b>Penguins</b> struck quickly with goals from Ryan Whitney and Hossa within the first eight minutes. Hossa added his second goal on an empty net to seal the victory. With the win, the <b>Penguins</b> become the first team since the 1983 Edmonton Oilers to start the playoffs 11–1. The <b>Penguins</b> failed to close out the Eastern Conference Finals with a sweep of the Flyers in Game 4, losing 4–2. The Flyers jumped out to a 3–0 lead in the first period. The <b>Penguins</b> fought back getting two goals from Jordan Staal in the third period, but Joffrey Lupul's second goal on an empty net sealed the win for the Flyers. The series returned to Pittsburgh for Game 5, where the <b>Penguins</b> won their eighth consecutive home game by a final score of 6–0, the Prince of Wales Trophy, and a trip to the Stanley Cup Final.|$|E
