50|$|Potato {{harvesters}} are {{machines that}} harvest potatoes. They work by lifting the potatoes {{from the bed}} using a share. Soil and crop are transferred onto a series of webs where the loose soil is sieved out. The potatoes are moved towards {{the back of the}} harvester on to a separation unit and then (on manned machines) to a <b>picking</b> <b>table</b> where people pick out the stones, clods, and haulms by hand. The potatoes then go on to a side elevator and into a trailer or a potato box.|$|E

50|$|The Great Extended Mill was {{developed}} {{in conjunction with the}} Great Extended Mine. A rich assay in 1885 influenced £11,500 expenditure on an elaborate treatment plant which was completed in 1888. It consisted of three 54 h.p. steam engines, six Jordan and Cummins patent jiggers, a Black and Marsden stone breaker, winding and pumping gear, six revolving screens, two Linkenbach round buddles, classifier, elevators, <b>picking</b> <b>tables,</b> grizzly and spitzcasten.|$|R

Richard King remained {{as director of the}} company and Edward King as mine manager. When operations resumed in 1890, the mill ran only briefly yielding 274 tons of concentrate valued at £6,411. Soon after it closed permanently and King's mine was let to tributors but it too closed at the end of 1891 when the company abandoned its leases.|$|R

25|$|In the new system, 14 {{numbered}} {{table tennis}} balls were used. Then, a four-number combination from the 14 balls {{were drawn to}} determine the lottery winner. Prior to the draft, the NBA assigns 1,000 possible combinations to the non-playoff teams. The process was then repeated to determine {{the second and third}} <b>pick.</b> The <b>table</b> below shows the lottery chances and the probabilities for each team to win the first pick in the weighted lottery system in 1993 and 1994 draft.|$|R

50|$|Typically a {{table with}} a big and flat {{saucepan}} is set up on the street, with a large number of ingredients in skewers being cooked in a mildly spicy broth.

Although in older times the dance was danced {{by a pair}} of either the same or {{opposite}} sex, it has been evolved a solo dance strictly masculine and is considered in some cases offensive to be interrupted by another dancer.

40|$|HyperCafe is an {{experimental}} hypermedia prototype, developed {{as an illustration}} of a general hypervideo system. This program places the user in a virtual cafe, composed primarily of digital video clips of actors involved in fictional conversations in the cafe; HyperCafe allows the user to follow different conversations, and offers dynamic opportunities of interaction via temporal, spatio-temporal and textual links to present alternative narratives. Textual elements are also present {{in the form of}} explanatory text, contradictory subtitles, and intruding narratives.

5000|$|In his autobiography, Barnes {{said that}} he first <b>picked</b> up a <b>table</b> tennis bat when visiting a snooker hall with an uncle. He was stopped from playing snooker because the manager at the club felt he was too short and he couldn't see over the table. His uncle, rather than {{disappoint}} him, said they could {{play a game of}} table tennis instead. It was on this occasion that he <b>picked</b> up a <b>table</b> tennis bat {{for the first time and}} realised that there was a lot of skill required to play it well. [...] During the school summer holidays in 1959, at the age of 12, he took his first step towards becoming a serious table tennis player. The Len Hoffman Youth Club took a group of boys to Butlin's holiday camp in Clacton. Whilst the other boys in the group went off to do other things he stayed behind in the table tennis hall. It was there that he received coaching from Harry Venner who was the resident coach and an England international at the time. Because he showed a lot of enthusiasm for the game and due to his rapid progress in learning how to play, Venner nominated him for 'Boy of the week' prize, a competition that was sponsored by the News of the World newspaper. Winning this prize meant that he could return later in the summer season for a free week's holiday to receive more coaching.|$|R

The most similar poisonous mushroom may be the devil's bolete (Rubroboletus satanas), which has a similar shape, but has a red stem and stains blue on bruising. It is often confused with the very bitter and unpalatable Tylopilus felleus, but can be distinguished by the reticulation on the stalk; in porcini, it is a whitish, net-like pattern on a brownish stalk, whereas it is a dark pattern on white in the latter. Porcini have whitish pores while the other has pink. If in doubt, tasting a tiny bit of flesh will yield a bitter taste. It can also resemble the [...] "bolete-like" [...] Gyroporus castaneus, which is generally smaller, and has a browner stem.|$|R
