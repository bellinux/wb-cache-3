25|$|NG2 {{is another}} type of chondroitin sulfate {{proteoglycan}} that is expressed by oligodendrocyte <b>precursor</b> <b>cells.</b> Oligodendrocyte <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> are {{another type of}} glial cell found in {{the central nervous system}} that play a role in glial scar formation. These cell types can develop into a normal oligodendrocyte or a glial fibrillary acidic protein positive astrocyte depending on environmental factors. NG2 is found on the surface of these cells and has been shown to inhibit neurite outgrowth extension, as well. These are high molecular weight transmembrane molecules with the largest portion extending into the extracellular space.|$|E

25|$|A recent study, done in November 2010 and {{published}} March 2011, {{was done by}} a team of scientists from the University of Rochester and University of Colorado School of Medicine. They did an experiment to attempt to repair trauma to the Central Nervous System of an adult rat by replacing the glial cells. When the glial cells were injected into the injury of the adult rat’s spinal cord, astrocytes were generated by exposing human glial <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> to bone morphogenetic protein (Bone morphogenetic protein is important because it is considered to create tissue architecture throughout the body). So, with the bone protein and human glial cells combined, they promoted significant recovery of conscious foot placement, axonal growth, and obvious increases in neuronal survival in the spinal cord laminae. On the other hand, human glial <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> and astrocytes generated from these cells by being in contact with ciliary neurotrophic factors, failed to promote neuronal survival and support of axonal growth at the spot of the injury.|$|E
25|$|When and how {{multipotent}} chromatophore <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> (called chromatoblasts) {{develop into}} their daughter subtypes {{is an area}} of ongoing research. It is known in zebrafish embryos, for example, that by 3 days after fertilization each of the cell classes found in the adult fish—melanophores, xanthophores and iridophores—are already present. Studies using mutant fish have demonstrated that transcription factors such as kit, sox10, and mitf are important in controlling chromatophore differentiation. If these proteins are defective, chromatophores may be regionally or entirely absent, resulting in a leucistic disorder.|$|E
25|$|The {{coating of}} {{platelets}} with IgG renders them susceptible to opsonization and phagocytosis by splenic macrophages, as well by Kupffer {{cells in the}} liver.nbsp& The IgG autoantibodies are also thought to damage megakaryocytes, the <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> to platelets, although this is believed to contribute only slightly to the decrease in platelet numbers.nbsp& Recent research now indicates that impaired production of the glycoprotein hormone thrombopoietin, which is the stimulant for platelet production, may be a contributing factor to the reduction in circulating platelets.nbsp& This observation {{has led to the}} development of a class of ITP-targeted drugs referred to as thrombopoietin receptor agonists.|$|E

25|$|The multi-potent {{pancreatic}} progenitor {{cells have}} the capacity to differentiate into any of the pancreatic cells: acinar cells, endocrine cells, and ductal cells. These progenitor cells are characterised by the co-expression of the transcription factors PDX1 and NKX6-1. Under the influence of neurogenin-3 and ISL1, but in the absence of notch receptor signaling, these cells differentiate to form two lines of committed endocrine <b>precursor</b> <b>cells.</b> The first line, under the direction of a Pax gene, forms α- and γ- cells, which produce glucagon and pancreatic polypeptides, respectively. The second line, influenced by Pax-6, produces beta cells (β-) and delta cells (δ-), which secrete insulin and somatostatin, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The sonic {{hedgehog}} (SHH) signaling molecule assumes various {{roles in}} patterning {{the central nervous}} system (CNS) during vertebrate development. One of the most characterized functions of SHH is its role in the induction of the floor plate and diverse ventral cell types within the neural tube. The notochord, a structure derived from the axial mesoderm, produces SHH, which travels extracellularly to the ventral region of the neural tube and instructs those cells to form the floor plate. Another view for floor plate induction hypothesizes that some <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> located in the notochord are inserted into the neural plate before its formation, later giving rise to the floor plate.|$|E
25|$|Astrocytes {{are crucial}} in {{clearance}} of neurotransmitters {{from within the}} synaptic cleft, which provides distinction between arrival of action potentials and prevents toxic build-up of certain neurotransmitters such as glutamate (excitotoxicity). It is also thought that glia {{play a role in}} many neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, at least in vitro, astrocytes can release gliotransmitter glutamate in response to certain stimulation. Another unique type of glial cell, the oligodendrocyte <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> or OPCs, have very well-defined and functional synapses from at least two major groups of neurons. The only notable differences between neurons and glial cells are neurons' possession of axons and dendrites, and capacity to generate action potentials.|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of lymphoblastic (<b>precursor</b> <b>cell)</b> neoplasms presents as leukemias. Consequently, {{the guidelines for}} lineage determination and subtyping of <b>precursor</b> <b>cell</b> neoplasms were primarily established for flow cytometry methods. Large-scale studies of nonleukemic lymphoblastic lymphomas are lacking so far. We analyzed a large series of pediatric patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma treated within a prospective randomized trial (the Euro-LB 02 study). Among 193 lymphomas, in which a detailed immunohistochemical analysis was carried out, there were several unusual and diagnostically challenging morphologic and immunophenotypical variants. These included 11 lymphomas with mixed phenotypes expressing markers of at least 2 hematopoietic lineages, 7 terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-negative lymphoblastic lymphomas, and 3 undifferentiated hematopoietic neoplasms {{that could not be}} assigned to any lineage with certainty. Our data indicate that World Health Organization guidelines for lineage determination and subtyping of <b>precursor</b> <b>cell</b> leukemia need to be adapted before they can be applied to immunohistochemical diagnosis of lymphoma. Using the experience from this cohort we suggest a resource-saving diagnostic staining panel for the immunohistochemical analysis of <b>precursor</b> <b>cell</b> neoplasms in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue...|$|R

25|$|Glia {{retain the}} ability to undergo cell {{division}} in adulthood, whereas most neurons cannot. The view {{is based on the}} general deficiency of the mature nervous system in replacing neurons after an injury, such as a stroke or trauma, while very often there is a profound proliferation of glia, or gliosis near or at the site of damage. However, detailed studies found no evidence that 'mature' glia, such as astrocytes or oligodendrocytes, retain the ability of mitosis. Only the resident oligodendrocyte <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> seem to keep this ability after the nervous system matures. On the other hand, there are a few regions in the mature nervous system, such as the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone, where generation of new neurons can be observed.|$|E
25|$|The cancellous part {{of bones}} contain bone marrow. Bone marrow {{produces}} blood cells {{in a process}} called hematopoiesis. Blood cells that are created in bone marrow include red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells. Progenitor cells such as the hematopoietic stem cell divide in a process called mitosis to produce <b>precursor</b> <b>cells.</b> These include precursors which eventually give rise to white blood cells, and erythroblasts which give rise to red blood cells. Unlike red and white blood cells, created by mitosis, platelets are shed from very large cells called megakaryocytes. This process of progressive differentiation occurs within the bone marrow. After the cells are matured, they enter the circulation. Every day, over 2.5 billion red blood cells and platelets, and 50–100 billion granulocytes are produced in this way.|$|E
25|$|Polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogels are {{biocompatible}} and {{proven to}} be tolerated in many tissue types, including the CNS. Mahoney and Anseth formed PEG hydrogels by photopolymerizing methacrylate groups covalently linked to degradable PEG macromers. Hydrogel degradation was monitored over time by measuring mechanical strength (compressive modulus) and average mesh size from swelling ratio data. Initially, the polymer chains were highly cross-linked, but as degradation proceeded, ester bonds were hydrolyzed, allowing the gel to swell; the compressive modulus decreased as the mesh size increased until the hydrogel was completely dissolved. It was demonstrated that neural <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> were able to be photoencapsulated and cultured on the PEG gels with minimal cell death. Because the mesh size is initially small, the hydrogel blocks inflammatory and other inhibitory signals from surrounding tissue. As the mesh size increases, the hydrogel is able {{to serve as a}} scaffold for axon regeneration.|$|E

25|$|Ciliary {{neurotrophic}} factor (CNTF) is a cytosolic protein {{that is not}} secreted. CNTF {{has been shown to}} promote the survival of neuronal cultures in vitro, and it can also act as a differentiator and trophic factor on glial cells. Further, CNTF has been previously shown to affect the differentiation of glial <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> in vitro; however, the influence of CNTF in the in vivo setting has only recently been determined. Winter et al. used CNTF over-expressing transgenic mice as well as wildtype controls that had CNTF levels artificially elevated via injection, were subjected to neuronal damage using ZnSO4 (a known neuronal degenerative factor), which was injected intranasally in the olfactory epithelium. The olfactory bulb was then assessed for the expression of GFAP mRNA- a common marker for the glial scar. It was determined that mice with elevated levels of CNTF increased their GFAP mRNA expression two-fold. This data suggests that CNTF may mediate glial scar formation following CNS damage.|$|E
25|$|IGFBP-3 exerts {{antiproliferative}} {{effects in}} many cell types by blocking {{the ability of}} IGF-1 and IGF-2 to activate the IGF1R (which stimulates cell proliferation). For example, in esophageal epithelial cells, responsiveness to IGF-1 stimulation is suppressed by secreted IGFBP-3 and restored when IGFBP-3 is downregulated by epidermal growth factor. IGFBP-3 can also inhibit cell function by mechanisms that are independent of effects on IGF1R signaling, even in cells that entirely lack IGF1R. IGF (or IGF1R) independent effects are commonly studied using mutant forms of IGFBP-3 with decreased IGF binding affinity. Thus, IGFBP-3-induced apoptosis in differentiating chondrocyte <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> is seen equally with a non-IGF binding IGFBP-3 mutant, demonstrating that the mechanism does not involve IGF binding. IGF1R-independent growth inhibition by IGFBP-3 may involve the induction of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bad and may be mediated by ceramides (pro-apoptotic lipids), or potentiate ceramide action IGFBP-3 interaction with nuclear hormone receptors may also lead to inhibition of cell proliferation.|$|E
25|$|Common lymphoid <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> that {{migrate to}} the thymus become known as T-cell {{precursors}} (or thymocytes) and do not express a T cell receptor. Broadly speaking, the double negative (DN) stage is focused on producing a functional β-chain whereas the double positive (DP) stage is focused on producing a functional α-chain, ultimately producing a functional αβ T cell receptor. As the developing thymocyte progresses through the four DN stages (DN1, DN2, DN3, and DN4), the T cell expresses an invariant α-chain but rearranges the β-chain locus. If the rearranged β-chain successfully pairs with the invariant α-chain, signals are produced which cease rearrangement of the β-chain (and silence the alternate allele) and result in proliferation of the cell. Although these signals require this pre-TCR at the cell surface, they are independent of ligand binding to the pre-TCR. These thymocytes will then express both CD4 and CD8 and progresses to the double positive (DP) stage where selection of the α-chain takes place. If a rearranged β-chain {{does not lead to}} any signalling (e.g. {{as a result of an}} inability to pair with the invariant α-chain), the cell may die by neglect (lack of signalling).|$|E

25|$|Following {{injury to}} the central nervous system, NG2 expressing {{oligodendrocyte}} <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> are seen around the site of injury within 48 hours of the initial injury. The number of NG2 expressing cells continues to increase {{for the next three}} to five days and high levels of NG2 are seen within seven–ten days of the injury. In vitro studies have been done to demonstrate the effect that NG2 levels play on neurite growth inhibition. Notably, neurons would not adhere to substrates made solely of NG2, which hints at its inhibitory effects on nerve regeneration. When grown on substrates containing both NG2 and adhesive molecules, neurite extension was shown to be reduced by 40-45% when compared to neurite extension on substrates only containing the adhesive molecules. Furthermore, cultures were created with striped surfaces that alternated NG2 lanes with lanes only containing adhesive molecules. Neurons and axons placed on these striped regions consistently stayed in the lanes without NG2. It is clear, then, that the accumulation of NG2 expressing cells at the site of injury creates an extracellular barrier that inhibits axon regrowth into the glial scar area.|$|E
25|$|Several {{experimental}} studies, {{which use}} heavy ion beams simulating space radiation, provide constructive {{evidence of the}} CNS risks from space radiation. First, exposure to HZE nuclei at low doses (<50 cGy) significantly induces neurocognitive deficits, such as learning and behavioral changes as well as operant reactions in the mouse and rat. Exposures to equal or higher doses of low-LET radiation (e.g., gamma or X rays) do not show similar effects. The threshold of performance deficit following exposure to HZE nuclei depends on both the physical characteristics of the particles, such as linear energy transfer (LET), and the animal age at exposure. A performance deficit {{has been shown to}} occur at doses that are similar to the ones that will occur on a Mars mission (<0.5 Gy). The neurocognitive deficits with the dopaminergic nervous system are similar to aging and appear to be unique to space radiation. Second, exposure to HZE disrupts neurogenesis in mice at low doses (<1 Gy), showing a significant dose-related reduction of new neurons and oligodendrocytes in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Third, reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neuronal <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> arise following exposure to HZE nuclei and protons at low dose, and can persist for several months. Antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents can possibly reduce these changes. Fourth, neuroinflammation arises from the CNS following exposure to HZE nuclei and protons. In addition, age-related genetic changes increase the sensitivity of the CNS to radiation.|$|E
500|$|While at the NINDS, Fischbach {{researched}} {{the effects of}} neuregulin, which is a family of proteins including heregulin, neu differentiation factor, ARIA, and glial growth factor that are critical for vertebrate embryogenesis and specifically {{for the formation of}} vertebrate spinal cord oligodendrocytes. [...] Fischbach and his colleagues noticed that oligodendrocytes failed to form in mice that were homozygous for the mutant neuregulin gene. [...] However, when wild-type neuregulin was added to homozygous mutant neuregulin explants (isolated tissue cell cultures) nine days after conception of the embryos, normal oligodendrocyte development occurred. This indicated that neuregulin is not necessary for the proliferation of oligodendrocyte multipotent <b>precursor</b> <b>cells.</b> [...] Additionally, when IgB4, a neuregulin inhibitor, is added to wild-type explants, oligodendrocyte development failed to occur.|$|E
