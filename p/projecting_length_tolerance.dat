40|$|A {{procedure}} {{to calculate the}} spatial fiber length in discontinuously reinforced composites from data of conventional metallographical images has been developed. The method {{is based on the}} following three assumptions: first, the measured length of a reinforcing fiber in a metallographical picture is a projection of the actual fiber length; second, the alignment of short fibers is axially symmetrical (for example, extruded composites in which the extrusion direction is a symmetry axis for the orientation of reinforcing fibers); third, for a representative number of fibers, the dependence of the <b>projected</b> <b>length</b> with the corresponding projected angle, along a given sample direction, is known.

40|$|The {{frequency}} distribution of fission-track lengths in an apatite reflects the mineral's thermal history {{since the time}} of its last crossing into the partial annealing zone (PAZ). Apatite thermal history analysis based on confined track length measurements is an already well-established tool in hydrocarbon exploration. In a less direct though more easily accessible way the thermal history is also reflected in the {{frequency distribution}} of the <b>projected</b> <b>lengths</b> of tracks intersecting the apatite surface. A mathematical description of the probability distribution of the <b>projected</b> <b>length</b> of surface tracks (PTLD, <b>projected</b> track <b>length</b> distribution) corresponding to different types of thermal history is presented and a new method for correcting thermally lowered fission-track ages is proposed. This correction method gives the time of entry into the PAZ at approximately 120 -degrees-C but also the time when the sample left the PAZ to enter the total track stability zone (at approximately 60 -degrees-C). An age function is subsequently defined which allows us to distinguish between different types of thermal history. Experimental verification shows that, although the proposed approach is less precise compared to existing methods based on <b>projected</b> track <b>lengths,</b> it is possible to distinguish between different thermal histories provided that a sufficient number of tracks are measured. On the other hand, the age function provides information relative to the samples' complete trajectory through the PAZ whereas existing methods are limited to temperatures below the closing temperature of the fission-track system...|$|R

An intensive monitoring study including monthly surveys of 125 profiles was conducted to quantify {{the performance of the}} beach fills.
