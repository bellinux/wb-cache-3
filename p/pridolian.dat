50|$|There is an inlier {{of rocks}} of Silurian {{age in the}} heart of the county. They consist of a thick {{sequence}} (over 600m / 2000 ft) assigned to the Přídolí, Ludlow and Wenlock series. The oldest parts of the succession, the Wenlock Shales and Wenlock Limestone of early authors are now referred to as the Glascoed Mudstone, Ton Siltstone and Usk Limestone. Together these comprise the local Wenlock succession. Above these are the former Lower Ludlow Shales, now the Lower and Upper Forest Beds, and the Aymestry Limestone, now the Lower Llanbadoc Beds. The Upper Llanbadoc Beds and Lower, Middle and Upper Llangibby Beds (collectively forming the larger part of the former Upper Ludlow Shales) complete the Ludlow series. All of these rocks are of marine origin, their lithologies suggestive of a variety of deep and shallow water environments during deposition.The uppermost Silurian rocks are the Downton Castle Sandstone and the overlying Raglan Mudstones, both of <b>Přídolían</b> age. The <b>Přídolían</b> rocks were deposited in various coastal and floodplain environments.|$|E

Well preserved Silurian radiolarian faunas recovered from several localities are described herein and include four new species: Ceratoikiscum kurosegum n. sp., Fusalfanus? konomoriensis n. sp., Futobari? jingamoriensis n. sp., and Futobari? tosaensis n. sp. The absence, {{within the same}} strata, of fossils belonging to other taxonomic groups has presented difficulties in determining the precise ages of the Kurosegawa radiolarian faunas. U/Pb SHRIMP ages of pyroclastic zircons from tuff units within the succession indicate Wenlockian [427. 2 ± 7. 6] and <b>Pridolian</b> [408. 9 ± 7. 6] ages and remove ambiguity regarding the Silurian age of tuffaceous rocks in the Kurosegawa sequence...|$|E
40|$|RECENT {{critical}} reviews 1 {{have suggested}} that evidence from microfossils 2 (that is spores with triradiate marks, sheets of “cells” or tubes with tracheid-like thickenings) {{should not be considered}} sufficient to demonstrate the existence of vascular plants in Silurian times; the only acceptable evidence being megafossils with tracheids in situ. Such was the evidence presented by Lang 3 when he described smooth axes from the Downton Series (<b>Pridolian</b> εβ 2) of the Welsh Borderland. These vascularised axes were found in association with two species of Cooksonia, very simple plants with smooth forking axes terminating in globose sporangia which contained spores bearing trilete marks. Megafossils morphologically similar to Cooksonia have been described from strata of similar age throughout the world, but the Lang specimens are the only ones with unequivocal tracheids and thus have hitherto been considered the earliest vascular plants. We report here the occurrence of a vascular plant in the slightly older Whitcliffian strata (Ludlow Series) of South Wales...|$|E
40|$|The Volissos Turbidites (also {{known as}} Chios Mélange) are a thick Palaeozoic wildflysch {{sequence}} that crops {{out on the}} Greek island of Chios. It consists of chert, limestone and volcanic olistholits floating in a siliciclastic turbiditic matrix. During the Early Carboniferous (Mississippian), these turbidites were severely deformed and structurally thickened probably at the toe of an accretionary wedge. Whereas there are many studies on the fossiliferous content of the limestone olistoliths, scant attention {{was given to the}} cherts. We report {{here for the first time}} some radiolarian and conodont assemblages from the chert olistholiths (ribbon radiolarites) embedded in the siliciclastic sequence of the Volissos Turbidites. The radiolarites sampled near Kardamila and Marmaro (northeastern Chios), where the Volissos Turbidites are not affected by metamorphism, have given identifiable radiolarians and conodonts. The different samples document different ages. Some radiolarians document Silurian, possible <b>Pridolian</b> age, whereas the conodonts indicate a distinct Famennian (late Late Devonian).

40|$|Fish microfossils were {{extracted}} from an erratic. The taxa {{from the rich}} microvertebrate fauna of late <b>Pridolian</b> (latest Silurian) age (P. punctatus Zone) are listed. A full description is given of two new Gomphonchus taxa, G. mediocostatus and G. boekschoteni. On the basis {{of old and new}} material, 'Gomphonchus hoppei' is redescribed, interpreted as a porosiform poracanthodid, and assigned to Gomphonchoporus gen. nov. This interpretation necessitates redefinition of the Poracanthodidae VERGOOSSEN 1997 to include scales without a pore-canal system. The type genus, Poracanthodes, is redefined to include only punctatiform poracanthodids sensu Vergoossen 1997. Discovery of previously undescribed scale forms of the type species, P. punctatus BROTZEN 1934, results in an extended diagnosis for this biozonal index fossil. A new poracanthodid genus, Radioporacanthodes, is erected for the porosiform poracanthodids sensu Vergoossen 1997, with type species R. porosus (BROTZEN) 1934 s. s. Brief palaeontological and distributional comments on other microvertebrate taxa from the list are included, as well as a section on the biostratigraphical and correlational implications of the present and similar faunas from erratics for the East Baltic standard succession...|$|E
40|$|The pteraspidiform heterostracans are jawless {{vertebrates}} {{known from}} the <b>Pridolian</b> (Upper Silurian) to the Givetian (Middle Devonian). This preliminary study focuses on the redetermination and restudying of the material collected in 1931 by Vascautanu from the Devonian formations from the former Romanian bank of the Dniester river, figured by Pauca in 1938. The material comes from the following collections: University of Bucharest Laboratory of Palaeontology and the National Geological Museum. The redetermination of the material {{is based on the}} study of the orbito-pineal region; biometric data and overall morphology and shape of the plates. The identification of the material follows the criteria presented by Blieck (1984) for his systematic, phylogenetic and biostratigraphic review of the pteraspidiform heterostracans from Great Britain, Podolia, Spitzbergen and the Ardenne Massif. Given the progres made in the study and of fossil agnathans, and also the fact that from 1938 until the present no study has been carried out on the material collected by Th.

40|$|Lower to Middle Devonian carbonates of the Prague Syncline, the Carnic Alps, the Montagne Noire, and the Cantabrian Mountains were {{investigated}} for delta(13) C(arb) and delta(13) C(org). These values were measured on bulk rocks, selected components and cements. Many carbonates exhibit prima R marine values, {{but some are}} altered by diagenesis. A delta(13) C curve can be presented for the latest <b>Pridolian</b> to Emsian time interval. Several sharp or broad positive excursions are obvious in the woschinidti-post-woschmidti, sulcatus, kitabicus, Late serotinus, and kockelianus conodont zones. The excursion at the Silurian-Devonian boundary is known worldwide and therefore considered global in nature. Some of the others are described {{for the first time}} from central and southern Europe, and their global nature has to be verified by further investigations in other regions. Most excursions relate to and/or started during major regressions whereas sea-level highstands correspond to minimal delta(13) C values. Similar relationships between sea-level changes and delta(13) C have been observed from other early Palaeozoic intervals. The transgressive Chotec (?) and Kacak events are marked by positive isotope excursions, this type of combination is usually observed in late Palaeozoic to Cenozoic black shale events...|$|E

A detailed study of the rocks in thin section and of the palaeontology of these beds and those immediately below them, showed that these beds are conformable with, and of similar age to, the Long Point Formation. They have, therefore, been named the Lourdes Member of the Long Point Formation. [...] The fauna of the upper part of the Misty Cove Member and the Lourdes Member of the Long Point Formation, and the fauna of the total exposed Clam Bank Formation is described.

40|$|The {{western part}} of the Central Armorican Terrane (WCAT), a low-grade middle- to upper-crustal domain exposed in the Armorican Massif (Brittany, France), is {{affected}} by an early Variscan contraction-dominated deformation event. Our work consists of a regional magnetic fabric analysis of homogeneous siltstone beds (HSB) in the Plougastel Formation (<b>Pridolian</b> to Lochkovian) that are exposed in different structural settings and levels of the WCAT. Macroscopically, the HSB’s show no internal bedding fabric. However, the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) systematically reveals a composite magnetic fabric, composed of both a bedding-parallel and a cleavage-parallel magnetic-carrier population. Based on petrography, demagnetization experiments and XRD analyses, we show that the bedding-parallel magnetic signal arises from a subtle rock fabric composed of ferromagnetic minerals with a strong internal anisotropy or Fe-rich phyllosilicates. The cleavage-parallel magnetic-carrier population is composed of micas. Despite a positive correlation between the degree of anisotropy (PJ) and the intensity of the mica XRD peak, the AMS signal arises from a complex interaction between both carrier populations. Thus, low-field AMS of a composite magnetic fabric cannot be used as a strain marker, without a more integrated approach (e. g. anisotropy of anhysteretic remanence magnetization (AARM) and low-temperature AMS). status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT—The {{discovery}} of a new naraoiid nektaspid in the Upper Silurian (<b>Pridolian)</b> of southeastern Ontario significantly extends the range of this unusual group. Nektaspids are nonmineralized arthropods typical of Early and Middle Cambrian soft-bottom com-munities, but were thought to have become extinct in the Late Ordovician. The unique holotype specimen of Naraoia bertiensis n. sp. comes from a Konservat–Lagerstätte deposit renowned for its eurypterid fauna (the Williamsville Member of the Bertie Formation). Naraoia bertiensis lacks thoracic segments and is morphologically similar to Naraoia compacta from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale, save {{for the presence of}} a long ventral cephalic doublure and a subtly pointed posterior shield. To examine the phylogenetic relationships of the new naraoiid, we coded characters of the holotype specimen and of nine previously described nektaspids. The results confirm a sister taxon relationship between Naraoia compacta and Naraoia bertiensis and the monophyly of nektaspid forms lacking thoracic segments (family Naraoiidae). This latter group may have arisen from an ancestral segment-bearing form through heterochronic loss of thoracic segments early in the Cambrian. The disjunct occurrence of a naraoiid nektaspid in the Late Silurian resembles the reappearance of other ‘‘Lazarus taxa’ ’ that were thought to have been eliminated during mass extinction events. The naraoiid lineage survived the Late Ordovician biotic crisis, but in this case the ‘‘Lazarus effect’ ’ seems likely to be taphonomic in origin...|$|E
40|$|The dating of radiolarian biostratigraphic zones {{from the}} Silurian to Devonian is only {{partially}} understood. Dating the zircons in radiolarian-bearing tuffaceous rocks has {{enabled us to}} ascribe practical ages to the radiolarian zones. To extend knowledge in this area, radiometric dating of magmatic zircons within the radiolarian-bearing Yoshiki Formation, Japan, was undertaken. The Yoshiki Formation is mainly composed of alternating beds of tuffaceous sandstones, tuffaceous mudstones, and felsic tuff. The felsic tuff and tuffaceous mudstone yield well-preserved radiolarian fossils. Radiolarians and zircon grains were collected from 21 tuffaceous mudstone and 30 tuff horizons of the Yoshiki Formation. The following radiolarian species which can be ascribed to the Zadrappolus yoshikiensis - Futobari solidus assemblage were identified: Oriundogutta (?) kingi, Oriundogutta (?) varispina, Zadrappolus yoshikiensis, Zadrappolus tenuis, Zadrappolus hitoeganensis, Zadrappolus lunaris, Zadrappolus (?) nudus, Zadrappolus (?) sp., Futobari solidus, Futobari morishitai, Rotasphaera (?) sp., and Ceratoikiscum armiger. U-Pb SHRIMP ages of 420. 5 ± 2. 5 Ma and 421. 0 ± 1. 9 Ma {{were obtained from the}} zircon grains. Thus the lower limit of the Zadrappolus yoshikiensis-Futobari solidus assemblage, that has previously been assigned to an age from <b>Přidolian</b> to Pragian, is in reality before Ludlowian. The technique in this paper has the capability of refining and making more accurate the dating of many radiolarian zones worldwide, and potentially of changing the direction of the entire study of radiolarian biostratigraphy...|$|E
40|$|The Gasp 6 Belt is {{the largest}} middle Paleozoic belt in the Canadian Appalachians. The most {{complete}} stratigraphic record of Upper Ordovician to Middle Devonian rocks of this belt occurs in the Gasp 6 Peninsula, in the northeastern part of the Qurbec re-entrant. Rocks of the Gasp 6 Belt rest unconformably on Cambrian to Ordovician rocks of the Humber and Dunnage zones, and are unconformably overlain by Carboniferous rocks. The regional metamorphic grade of the Gasp 6 Belt rocks is very low, and some units {{are still in the}} oil window. The deformation history of the Gasp 6 Belt rocks comprises multi-stage deformation events represented by two phas-es. A Late Silurian to Early Devonian phase, the Salinic disturbance, manifested by an unconformity, NW-trending folding, synsedimentary faulting, and intra-plate volcanism. The late Early to Middle Devonian Acadian phase is recorded by NE-trending folding, cleavage development and both reverse and strike-slip faulting within a transpressive setting during the oblique continental collision between Laurentia nd Avalon (a peri-Gondwanan terrane), which took place farther southeast. The tectonic setting during the Salinic disturbance is consistent with continuous plate conver-gence (without subduction) after he Taconian Orogeny and before the Acadian continental collision.

40|$|The Paleozoic stratigraphic {{succession}} in the Catalonian Coastal Ranges {{spans the}} interval from Cambrian(?) to Carboniferous, {{with only one}} break, separating the pre-Carboniferous part of the sequence from the Carboniferous. The oldest rocks exposed form a sequence of schists, fine grained sandstones, gneisses (laminar pre-Hercynian intrusions), marbles, orto- and para-amphibolites and calcsilicate rocks. comparison with other localities iuggests an Early Cambrian age (or perhaps in part older). Upwards the sequence becomes more monotonous andconsists only of schists (or slates where themetamorphic grade is lower) and thin fine-grained sandstone layers (Cambrian-Ordovician). Still higher in the sequence, an altemation of greywackes and slates is found, with interlayered mud-supported conglomerates at its lower part and acid volcanic rocks which occur throughout the whole sequence. This part of the sequence has provided the oldest faunas known in the Catalonian Coastal Ranges, which indicate the Caradoc. Finally, in its uppermost part, the Ordovician sequence contains some thin limestone layers that contain Ashgill faunas. The Silurian, from Llandovery to Lower Ludlow, consists of black graptolitic shales with dolerite sills, whilst the upper Ludlow, <b>Pridolian</b> and Devonian consist of nodular limestones and marls withpelagic and hemipelagic faunas. The youngest Devonian faunas found correspond in general to the Emsian. The existence of a gap at this point of the sequence suggests the possibility {{that part of the}} Devonian could have been eroded. The Carboniferous is characterized by a thick culm sequence (Visean to Westphalian?), resting on thin chert and limestone layers (Tournaisian and Visean).

40|$|The {{study of}} {{dolostone}} of the Lower Silurian Sayabec Formation of the Lac Matapédia syncline, {{at the western}} end of the Gaspé Peninsula, sheds new light on porosity development and reservoir potential of the area. The dolomitized section is close to the Shickshock Sud Fault that cuts the southern limb of the syncline. The dolostone occurs either as a highly brecciated unit or as stratiform replacement of peritidal carbonates {{at the base of the}} formation. Residual bitumen is seen in the breccia as well as filling of small secondary vugs and fractures within the stratiform dolostone. The dolostone consists predominantly of replacive matrix dolomite; petrography and oxygen and carbon stable isotope ratios (δ 18 OVPDB = – 6. 3 to – 7. 8 ‰ and δ 13 CVPDB = 1. 2 to 3. 3 ‰) of the matrix dolomite indicate early burial formation with later recrystallization in the presence of high temperature fluids. Saddle dolomite is found as a pore-filling cement in secondary dissolution pores and fractures. Oxygen stable isotope ratios of the saddle dolomite cement (δ 18 OVPDB = – 14. 5 and – 15. 3 ‰) indicate precipitation at high temperature. Dull luminescent burial calcite cement follows saddle dolomite. Later dissolution is locally apparent in carbonates as scalloped surfaces covered by finely laminated, bright-very dull luminescent calcites. Petrography and stable isotope ratios of the calcite (δ 18 OVPDB = – 10. 1 and – 11. 2 ‰ and δ 13 CVPDB = – 2. 3 and – 6. 9 ‰) suggest precipitation from meteoric waters. Meteoric dissolution and luminescent-zoned calcite cements are related to a <b>Pridolian</b> sea level lowstand. This even...|$|E
40|$|The {{anisotropy}} {{of magnetic}} susceptibility (AMS) {{has been used}} as a petrofabric indicator since the early 1950 s. Many studies have advocated a relationship with finite strain, and so AMS has been frequently used as a strain gauge. In these studies, AMS is used as an indicator of the preferred orientation of grains in a volume of rock. However, the measured anisotropy is defined by a combination of two effects: the intrinsic magnetic anisotropy of the minerals and the anisotropic distribution of the mineral grains, i. e. the rock fabric. This work deals with the effect of mineralogical and chemical composition on AMS. As natural samples generally contain compositional variations, these effects must be qualitatively understood before one can use AMS as an indicator of a mineral preferred orientation for regional strain analysis. Samples were taken in homogeneous siltstone beds of the Plougastel Formation (<b>Pridolian</b> to Lochkovian age) on the Crozon peninsula (Brittany, France), the westernmost part of the Palaeozoic Armorican terrane. These rocks were subjected to contractional deformation at the beginning of the Carboniferous due to the closure of the Rheic Ocean, resulting in reverse faults and folds with associated axial-plane cleavage. A comparison of low-field, room temperature AMS and low-field, low temperature AMS of 71 samples shows a temperature dependency in perfect agreement with the Curie-Weiss law, typical for paramagnetic material. The dominant paramagnetic nature of the samples is further confirmed by measurements of 30 samples with a high-field torque magnetometer that show a very good agreement between the high-field paramagnetic and the low-field susceptibilities. The paramagnetic mineralogy was further investigated by XRD measurements, with special focus on the phyllosilicates, generally the main paramagnetic AMS carriers in fine-grained siliciclastic rocks. This analysis shows a very consistent mineral content, with the presence of quartz, illite and/or muscovite, pyrophyllite and Fe-rich chlorite. However, the exact composition of the different samples is quite variable, with the total phyllosilicate content ranging from 10 % up to 38 %. The results demonstrate a relationship between the degree of magnetic anisotropy and the phyllosilicate content. Assuming that the preferred orientation is fairly consistent for samples of the same, homogeneous lithology in one particular tectonostratigraphic context, such a relationship should be considered to correct AMS measurements for variation due to mineralogical composition, prior to its application as petrofabric indicator. status: publishe...|$|E
