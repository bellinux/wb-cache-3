5|$|Several other <b>Privy</b> Councils {{have advised}} the sovereign. England and Scotland once had {{separate}} <b>Privy</b> Councils (the <b>Privy</b> Council of England and <b>Privy</b> Council of Scotland). The Acts of Union 1707 united {{the two countries}} into the Kingdom of Great Britain and in 1708 the Parliament of Great Britain abolished the <b>Privy</b> Council of Scotland. Thereafter there was one <b>Privy</b> Council of Great Britain sitting in London. Ireland, on the other hand, continued to have a separate <b>Privy</b> Council even after the Act of Union 1800. The <b>Privy</b> Council of Ireland was abolished in 1922, when {{the southern part of}} Ireland separated from the United Kingdom; it was succeeded by the <b>Privy</b> Council of Northern Ireland, which became dormant after the suspension of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in 1972. No further appointments have been made since then, and only four appointees were still living as of May 2014.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>Privy</b> Council is {{primarily}} a British institution, officials from some other Commonwealth realms are also appointed. By 2000, the most notable instance was New Zealand, whose Prime Minister, senior politicians, Chief Justice and Court of Appeal Justices were traditionally appointed <b>Privy</b> Counsellors. However, appointments of New Zealand members have since been discontinued. The Prime Minister, the Speaker, the Governor-General and the Chief Justice of New Zealand are still accorded the style Right Honourable, but without membership of the Council. Until the late 20th century, the Prime Ministers and Chief Justices of Canada and Australia were also appointed <b>Privy</b> Counsellors. Canada also has its own <b>Privy</b> Council, the Queen's <b>Privy</b> Council for Canada (see below). Prime Ministers of some other Commonwealth countries that retain the Queen as their sovereign continue to be sworn of the Council.|$|E
5|$|British {{political}} institutions include the Westminster system, the Commonwealth of Nations and <b>Privy</b> Council of the United Kingdom. Although the <b>Privy</b> Council {{is primarily a}} British institution, officials from other Commonwealth realms are also appointed to the body. The most notable continuing instance is the Prime Minister of New Zealand, its senior politicians, Chief Justice and Court of Appeal judges are conventionally made <b>Privy</b> Counsellors, as the prime ministers and chief justices of Canada and Australia used to be. Prime Ministers of Commonwealth countries which retain the British monarch as their sovereign continue to be sworn as <b>Privy</b> Counsellors.|$|E
50|$|The {{first half}} of the book {{presents}} a brief history of human sanitation disposal starting from the digging of small holes to the “earth closet”; the “privy pioneers” of the Minoans, Romans, and Normans; and information about cesspits. The second half examines multiple examples of Welsh <b>privies,</b> how they were constructed, and how they were used. Roberts also writes about industrial <b>privies,</b> public <b>privies,</b> and the restoration of old <b>privies.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Roberts was {{contacted}} by friends in south and mid-Wales {{about how they}} also had endangered <b>privies</b> but no way of [...] "keeping them in remembrance." [...] Roberts wrote to Cadw, the Welsh heritage service of the Welsh Assembly Government, to warn them of the [...] "great catastrophe that was befalling Wales" [...] {{with the loss of}} garden <b>privies.</b> Cadw offered a research grant to create the book on Welsh <b>privies.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Privies</b> of Wales is a nonfiction book by J. Aelwyn Roberts, {{a former}} vicar of Llandegai. The book traces {{a history of}} human {{sanitation}} and examines individual examples of Welsh garden <b>privies.</b> The research for the book was paid for {{by a grant from}} Cadw.|$|R
5|$|The {{balance of}} <b>Privy</b> Counsellors is largely {{made up of}} politicians. The Prime Minister, Cabinet ministers and the Leader of HM Opposition are {{traditionally}} sworn of the <b>Privy</b> Council upon appointment. Leaders of major parties in the House of Commons, First Ministers of the devolved assemblies, some senior Ministers outside Cabinet, and on occasion other respected senior parliamentarians are appointed <b>Privy</b> Counsellors.|$|E
5|$|After the {{destruction}} by fire of the Palace of Whitehall in 1698, the surroundings of the <b>Privy</b> Garden changed dramatically. Most {{of the palace}} buildings had been burned down in the 1698 fire; others were torn down as {{the last vestiges of}} the old Tudor and Stuart Palace were removed. With the demise of the <b>Privy</b> Gallery, the <b>Privy</b> Garden was extended north to include the Pebble Court behind the Banqueting House.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{judicial}} {{functions are}} also {{performed by the}} Queen-in-Council, although in practice its actual work of hearing and deciding upon cases is carried out day-to-day by the Judicial Committee of the <b>Privy</b> Council. The Judicial Committee consists of senior judges appointed as <b>Privy</b> Counsellors: predominantly Justices of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and senior judges from the Commonwealth. The <b>Privy</b> Council formerly acted as the High Court of Appeal for the entire British Empire (other than for the United Kingdom itself), and continues to hear appeals from the Crown Dependencies, the British Overseas Territories, and some independent Commonwealth states.|$|E
50|$|Facilities in {{the school}} yard {{included}} <b>privies,</b> a playground with swings and a slide, two basketball courts and a baseball field. The 1957 expansion of the building included installation of indoor plumbing, including indoor bathrooms, thus {{eliminating the need for}} the <b>privies.</b> A cafeteria also was added in 1957.|$|R

5|$|Distinct from Orders-in-Council are Orders of Council: {{the former}} are issued by the {{sovereign}} upon {{the advice of the}} <b>Privy</b> Council, whereas the latter are made by members of the <b>Privy</b> Council without requiring the sovereign's approval. They are issued under the specific authority of Acts of Parliament, and most commonly are used for the regulation of public institutions.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{had managed}} this last {{category}} of personal treasure through an organisation called the <b>Privy</b> Wardrobe. The Keeper of the <b>Privy</b> Wardrobe {{was responsible for}} guarding and recording the king's belongings, and dispatching particular items around the kingdom, potentially giving them as gifts to the monarch's family and friends. The <b>Privy</b> Wardrobe was initially based in the Tower of London in Edward's reign and became focused on handling the supplies for his campaigns in France. This probably encouraged the King to decide {{to build a new}} tower in Westminster to host a separate branch of the <b>Privy</b> Wardrobe specifically to manage his personal jewels and plate. In practice, this branch also managed the clothes, vestments and similar goods belonging to the royal household– effectively, the non-military parts of the King's property.|$|E
5|$|Full {{meetings}} of the <b>Privy</b> Council are held only when the reigning sovereign announces {{his or her own}} engagement (which last happened on 23 November 1839, in the reign of Queen Victoria); or when there is a demise of the Crown, either by the death or abdication of the monarch. A full meeting of the <b>Privy</b> Council was also held on 6 February 1811, when George, Prince of Wales was sworn in as Prince Regent by Act of Parliament. The current statutes regulating the establishment of a regency in the case of minority or incapacity of the sovereign also require any regents to swear their oaths before the <b>Privy</b> Council.|$|E
5000|$|Battle {{went on to}} tell me he was {{virtually}} giving {{me the opportunity to}} write a book that would be read by generations to come. He was inviting me to write a classic. He suggested that I could be to Welsh <b>Privies</b> what George Borrow is to Wales. He elaborated that if I wrote a book on the <b>privies</b> of North Wales for his publishing firm no other publishing firm in the country would touch the subject for another twenty years. And in twenty years, he said, “there will be no <b>privies</b> in North Wales for anyone to write about”. I am a vain person. I have always wanted to be the author of a classic. The book was written and very well received.|$|R

5|$|Her Majesty's Most Honourable <b>Privy</b> Council, usually known {{simply as}} the <b>Privy</b> Council, is a formal body of {{advisers}} to the Sovereign of the United Kingdom.

5|$|I {{therefore}} {{write to}} ask you to accept my resignation as a <b>Privy</b> Councillor and to revoke my baronetcy.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{can choose}} to resign, {{sometimes}} to avoid expulsion: three members voluntarily left the <b>Privy</b> Council in the 20th century: Jonathan Aitken, on 25 June 1997 following allegations of perjury; John Profumo, who resigned on 26 June 1963; and John Stonehouse, who resigned on 17 August 1976. On 4 February 2013, Chris Huhne {{announced that he would}} voluntarily leave the <b>Privy</b> Council after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice.|$|E

5|$|It was {{formerly}} regarded by the <b>Privy</b> Council as criminal, and possibly treasonous, {{to disclose the}} oath administered to <b>Privy</b> Counsellors as they take office. However, the oath was officially made public by the Blair Government in a written parliamentary answer in 1998, as follows. It had also been read out in full in the House of Lords during debate by Lord Rankeillour on 21 December 1932.|$|E
5|$|Meetings of the <b>Privy</b> Council are {{normally}} held once each month wherever the sovereign {{may be in}} residence at the time. The quorum, according to the <b>Privy</b> Council Office, is three, though some statutes provide for other quorums (for example, section 35 of the Opticians Act 1989 provides for a lower quorum of two).|$|E
5|$|On 6 May 1970, Stewart {{suggested}} to Wilson {{that they should}} formally advise the Queen to remove Beadle from the <b>Privy</b> Council. Wilson resolved to {{wait until after the}} British general election the following month. This decision proved decisive for Beadle as, to the surprise of many, the Conservatives won the election, and Edward Heath replaced Wilson as Prime Minister. Heath's government decided against removing Beadle from the <b>Privy</b> Council, surmising that this would only hinder progress towards an accommodation with Smith. Beadle remained a <b>Privy</b> Counsellor {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

5|$|The Church of England's three senior bishops—the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Archbishop of York and the Bishop of London—become <b>Privy</b> Counsellors upon appointment. Senior {{members of}} the Royal Family may also be appointed, but this is {{confined}} to the current consort and heir apparent and consort. Prince Philip is at present the most senior member by length of service, {{and he is the}} only current <b>Privy</b> Counsellor not appointed by the reigning monarch, having been sworn of the Council by her father. The Private Secretary to the Sovereign is always appointed a <b>Privy</b> Counsellor, as are the Lord Chamberlain, the Speaker of the House of Commons, and the Lord Speaker. Justices of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, judges of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, senior judges of the Inner House of the Court of Session (Scotland's highest law court) and the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland also join the <b>Privy</b> Council ex officio.|$|E

50|$|After being dug out, {{the solid}} waste was removed in large barrels or pipes, which were loaded onto a horse-drawn cart. As <b>privies</b> spread to the residences of {{ordinary}} citizens they were often built in backyards with rear access or alleyways, to avoid the need to carry barrels of waste through {{the house to the}} street. Much of what is known about London's <b>privies</b> during the 17th and 18th century comes from witness statements describing what had been discovered among the human excrement, such as the corpses of unwanted infants.|$|R
