5|$|Like {{all other}} US states, New Jersey sets a 0.08 <b>percent</b> <b>weight</b> by volume {{blood alcohol content}} (BAC) as the {{threshold}} for intoxication when operating a motor vehicle (e.g. automobile, boat). It is possible {{to be charged with}} driving under the influence (DUI) with a BAC level below 0.08%, but there is a presumption in that situation that the driver is not intoxicated. State law prohibits those under 21 from driving if their BAC is 0.01% or more, prohibits the operation of a commercial vehicle with a BAC of 0.04% or more, and mandates that drivers submit a breath sample if requested by a police officer. To be convicted of DUI in New Jersey, a person must be operating or attempting to operate a motorized vehicle; thus activities such as sleeping in a car while intoxicated or bicycling while drunk are not illegal.|$|E
25|$|Heinz tomato ketchup’s {{ingredients}} are: {{tomato concentrate}} from red ripe tomatoes, distilled vinegar, high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, salt, spice, onion powder, and natural flavoring. Tomato concentrate from red ripe tomatoes {{is the first}} ingredient on the list, which means it has {{the highest percentage of}} weight within the final product. Tomatoes have a complex composition of sugars, starch, pectin, ascorbic acids, organic acids, amino acids, steroids, carotenoids, lipids, free fatty acids, and volatiles. The second ingredient listed is distilled vinegar, which is eighty percent pure water and twenty percent acetic acid. Next is high fructose corn syrup, which is made up of 42% fructose, 53% glucose, and 5% other polysaccharides and sugars. Corn syrup is 100% glucose. Salt is the next ingredient listed and is composed of sodium and chloride ions. Spice, onion powder, and natural flavoring are the last ingredients on the list, meaning that they have the least <b>percent</b> <b>weight.</b> These three ingredients contribute to overall flavor of the product.|$|E
500|$|Before SABR's {{involvement}} in the voting process, The Boston Globe writer Peter Abraham said the Fielding Bible Awards [...] "are far more accurate (and accountable)" [...] than the Gold Glove awards since statistics are used along with the opinions of an expert panel. The Gold Gloves are selected by managers and coaches that may have seen a player as few as six times during the season. Bill Chuck of Comcast SportsNet New England wrote that Gold Glove voters frequently counted only errors to determine winners. Geoff Baker of The Seattle Times said the votes for the Gold Gloves rely largely on a player's past reputation. The Associated Press wrote that [...] "some fans have viewed the Gold Gloves as mostly a popularity contest, even suggesting that a player's performance at the plate helped draw extra attention to his glove." [...] After winning the AL Gold Glove at first base in both 1997 and 1998, Rafael Palmeiro won again in 1999 with the Texas Rangers while only appearing in 28 games as a first baseman; he played in 128 games as a designated hitter that season, resulting in a controversy. Derek Jeter, winner of five Gold Gloves, believes that many defensive factors cannot be quantified. In 2013, Rawlings collaborated on the Gold Glove Award with SABR, who provided the SABR Defensive Index (SDI) to add a sabermetric component to the selection process. [...] The index accounted for 25 percent of the vote, while managers and coaches continued to provide the majority. Afterwards, Jay Jaffe of Sports Illustrated wrote that the Gold Gloves [...] "appear to have significantly closed the gap on their more statistically-driven counterparts." [...] SABR and FiveThirtyEight believed that the impact to the voting results by SDI, which is also included on the voters' ballots, went beyond its 25 own <b>percent</b> <b>weight</b> and also influenced the managers' and coaches' voting.|$|E

40|$|A new {{technique}} is introduced to quantify microsegregation during rapid solidification.

The calculation is based on using volume <b>percent</b> eutectic and <b>weight</b> <b>percent</b> of second phase (in the eutectic), which were obtained experimentally. Neutron diffraction experiments and stereology calculation on scanning electron microscope images were done on impulse atomized Al-Cu alloys of three compositions (nominal), 5 wt pct Cu, 10 wt pct Cu, and 17 wt pct Cu, atomized under N- 2 and He gas. Neutron diffraction experiments yielded <b>weight</b> <b>percent</b> CuAl 2 data and stereology yielded volume percent eutectic data.
