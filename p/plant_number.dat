500|$|In 1905 American Window Glass sold {{some of its}} smaller plants, {{including}} Hartford City's <b>plant</b> <b>number</b> 32. [...] <b>Plant</b> <b>number</b> 3 still continued operations.

Before the start of World War I, American Window Glass Company was still the dominant window glass manufacturer, accounting [...] for {{over half of the}} nation's window glass manufacturing capacity. [...] In 1913, the company continued to close many of its smaller plants, while the large plants were equipped with the glass blowing machines. <b>Plant</b> <b>number</b> 3 was the third largest window glass factory in the United States, and the largest west of Pennsylvania. [...] The Belgian portion of Hartford City's glassmaking workforce was dramatically reduced because of two factors: [...] the glass-blowing machine replaced human glass blowers; and Belgians had difficulty returning from summer vacations in their European homeland after the start of World War I.|$|E
500|$|Because of the {{improved}} technology and processes utilized by competitors, {{many of the}} American Window Glass patents, and much of its machinery, became obsolete. By the late 1920s, American Window Glass was forced to begin re-equipping its plants with new machinery. The company underwent a financial reorganization in 1929. Dividends on its preferred stock were lowered. Although a few plants were re-equipped, the Hartford City plant was not. [...] Hartford City's natural gas supply was depleted, {{and the type of}} sand used to produce glass was in better supply near other American Window Glass plants in Pennsylvania. Thus, American Window Glass Company <b>plant</b> <b>number</b> 3, the former Hartford City Glass Company, was closed in 1929.|$|E

500|$|Many of the Indiana glass works {{acquired}} by the trust were from the East Central Indiana Gas Belt. Among those plants were the Hartford City Glass Company; and the nearby Muncie plants of Maring, Hart, and Company and C. H. Over. Other plants were located in Anderson, Dunkirk, and Fairmount, Indiana. [...] The Hartford City Glass Company became known as <b>Plant</b> <b>Number</b> 3 of the American Window Glass Company. [...] J. R. Johnston, already manager for Hartford City Glass Company, was named manager of the American Window Glass {{version of the same}} plant in December. [...] A second window glass factory from Hartford City, Jones Glass Company, was also acquired—and became plant No. 32. [...] Eventually, the company acquired 41 glass factories.|$|E
500|$|In June 1880, only 171 people held {{manufacturing}} jobs in Blackford County. [...] The Indiana Gas Boom transformed the region, as manufacturers {{moved to the}} area to utilize the natural gas and railroad system. [...] During 1901, Indiana state inspectors visited 21 manufacturing facilities in Blackford County, and these companies employed 1,346 people (compare to 171 two decades earlier). [...] Since these inspections were in Hartford City and Montpelier only, additional manufacturing employees from the county's small communities (such as [...] Millgrove's glass factory) could {{be added to the}} count of 1,346. [...] The county's two largest employers were glass factories: [...] American Window Glass <b>plant</b> <b>number</b> 3 and Sneath Glass Company. Hartford City's resources (low cost energy, two railroads, and workforce) were especially favored by glass factories, and a 1904 directory lists 10 of them.|$|E
500|$|After the acquisition, the Hartford City Glass works {{became known}} as <b>plant</b> <b>number</b> 3 of the American Window Glass Company. The plant {{employed}} 450 people in 1901. [...] As natural gas supplies in Indiana became depleted, many manufacturers moved or did not survive. [...] The major plants of the American Window Glass successfully changed energy sources from natural gas to gas made from coal. [...] The company also had a technological advantage. Instead of using a glass blower, American Window Glass plants extracted molten glass with a machine. The machine, which was not immediately utilized at all American Window Glass plants, {{was known as the}} Lubbers blowing machine. Refinements to the machine and glass-making process were made at the Hartford City works by plant manager Harry G. Slingluff. Production records for the entire company were set at the Hartford City plant in 1905 and 1907—using the Lubbers machines.|$|E

It was then removed and planted in a remote place close to a brother long-styled <b>plant</b> <b>Number</b> 2, so that it must have been freely though illegitimately fertilised; under these circumstances it did not yield during 1864 and 1865 a single capsule. I should here state that a legitimate or ordinary long-styled plant, when growing isolated, and freely though illegitimately fertilised by insects with its own pollen, yielded an immense number of capsules, which contained on an average 21.5 seeds.|$|E
60|$|In {{order to}} {{judge of the}} degree of inferiority in {{fertility}} of the several illegitimate plants, the following statement of the average and of the maximum number of seeds produced by ordinary or legitimate plants, when legitimately fertilised, some artificially and some naturally, will serve as a standard of comparison, and may in each case be referred to. But I give under each experiment the percentage of seeds produced by the illegitimate plants, in comparison with the standard legitimate number of the same form. For instance, ten capsules from the illegitimate long-styled <b>plant</b> (<b>Number</b> 10), which was legitimately and naturally fertilised by other illegitimate plants, contained on an average 44.2 seeds; whereas the capsules on legitimate long-styled plants, legitimately and naturally fertilised by other legitimate plants, contained on an average 93 seeds.

The result of this experiment, by the increace of <b>planting</b> <b>number</b> from 3 to 5, the number of panicle increased, and the yield became increasing. Since the increased of <b>planting</b> <b>number</b> increased the top prior, the result was obtained that the weight of leaf and stem/weoght of root and all leaves length/weight of root increased. Then, transpiration and nitrate content of the leaf blades lowered by decrease of relative amount of root. It was indicated that low supply of water and nutrition per unit leaf area from root system decreased, and as the result, photosynthetic rate per unit area might be lowered. ...|$|R
