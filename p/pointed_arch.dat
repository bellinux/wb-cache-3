5|$|The west door, {{actually}} in {{the south side of}} the church, is an elegant ornamented Decorated Gothic <b>pointed</b> <b>arch,</b> traditionally said to have come from Strata Florida Abbey. Whether it actually came from the Abbey is uncertain. A more probable date is thirteenth century, given its syle. Strata Florida Abbey was founded in 1164 and was consecrated in 1201. The arch is exceptionally ornate, indeed the finest such work in the county. It has three deeply moulded shafts each triple-roll with keel to centre roll and stiff-leaf capitals and matching triple mouldings to the <b>pointed</b> <b>arch,</b> with hoodmould. There is no evidence, archaeological or documentary, that it came from Strata Florida, or indeed anywhere else.|$|E
5|$|The Gothic Revival {{church is}} in the Early English style. It is built from rubble masonry dressed with {{limestone}} and has a slate roof. The vestry is partially built from material used in the old church. The door in the vestry's north wall has medieval doorjambs, and the keystone of the <b>pointed</b> <b>arch,</b> which is also medieval, is a carved human face.|$|E
5|$|The {{nineteenth century}} porch {{has a big}} ashlar triple-chamfered <b>pointed</b> <b>arch,</b> hoodmould and stone voussoirs. There is a boarded {{segmental}} pointed roof, stone side benches and a quarry tiles floor. There are three {{steps up to the}} fine oak double doors by Seddon, with wrought iron hinges and cambered lintel under an oak tympanum with roundel pierced with three leaded trefoils and a trefoil each side.|$|E
50|$|The {{church has}} tall <b>pointed</b> <b>arched</b> {{windows in the}} side walls. Stained glass hopper windows {{replaced}} the original casement windows in 1972. The end walls and the attached vestibules have small <b>pointed</b> <b>arched</b> windows.|$|R
5000|$|Internally {{the church}} has a six bay nave, defined by a <b>pointed</b> <b>arched</b> arcade {{supported}} on granite columns with polished shafts. A large <b>pointed</b> chancel <b>arch</b> demarcates the sanctuary, which features a rose window and a fine marble High Altar. Two shallow side altars in <b>pointed</b> <b>arched</b> recesses flank the sanctuary and terminate the side aisles of the church ...|$|R

5|$|The two-storey Master's Tower was the {{original}} access to the College from the river. A single-storey structure {{is attached to the}} south side. The ruined gateway stands to the south separated from the other structures by the almshouses. Poste records that in 1847 it stood between two barns, neither of which now remain. It consists of a <b>pointed</b> <b>arch</b> for carriages in a roughly coursed rag-stone wall flanked by buttress walls on each side.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} built from rubble masonry, dressed with freestone. It {{measures}} 45 feet by 14 feet 6inches (14 by 4.4metres). The building is largely 12th-century in construction, with {{the walls and}} a narrow lancet window in the south wall dating from that time; another window at {{the east end of}} the south wall is rectangular and dates from the late 14th or early 15th centuries, with a more modern window in between. The east wall and window, with stone tracery and an ogee-topped light in a <b>pointed</b> <b>arch,</b> are from the 14th century. Some of the windows use atypical green glass, and some have frames made out of wood.|$|E
5|$|The east {{window in}} the chancel is {{in the shape of}} a <b>pointed</b> <b>arch</b> and dates from the 15th century; it has three lights topped with cinquefoils and a hood mould. On the north side of the nave there is a {{rectangular}} window from 1865. The 16th-century south transept has windows in the south and east walls: the south window has three lights topped with trefoils in a 16th-century arch, and the east window is small and rectangular, using some dressings from the 14th century. The wide opening between the transept and the rest of the church is spanned with a large wooden beam.|$|E

50|$|The chancel is boarded {{to about}} 2100mm with timber panelling, {{featuring}} carvings of <b>pointed</b> <b>arches</b> with foiled heads. This panelling steps {{higher on the}} rear, northern, wall. On this wall and above the stepped panelling is a tripartite group of stained and coloured glass featuring images from the Adoration of the Magi and housed in a <b>pointed</b> <b>arched</b> recess.|$|R
5|$|The {{ground floor}} contains, {{in the west}} section, the former dining room and kitchen. The {{openings}} in the wall between the billiard room and the garden room had been blocked up but the rooms were reconnected in the 19th century under Sir William Henry Cope, uncovering an original doorway with a four-centred <b>pointed</b> <b>arch.</b> Cope applied arabesque patterns to the panelling in the garden room, which he had traced when two of the bedrooms were being repainted. The billiard room has a hidden door leading to the original entrance {{on the north side}} of the house through the Foxley gatehouse into the interior courtyard, and several doorways remain in the kitchen and housekeeping areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{windows in}} the 19th-century part are topped with trefoils (a {{stonework}} pattern of three overlapping circles) and set into square frames. The north wall has three windows, one with a single light (or section) and two with pairs of lights; there are two windows on the south wall (one with three lights, another with two) {{as well as a}} blocked window at the east end of the wall. The church's east window is a <b>pointed</b> <b>arch</b> with a lower section of three trefoil-headed lights and two smaller lights on top. The {{windows in the}} extension are set into pointed arches.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1904 {{he built}} the Chalet de Catllaràs, in La Pobla de Lillet, for the Asland cement factory, owned by Eusebi Güell. It has a simple {{structure}} though very original, {{in the shape}} of a <b>pointed</b> <b>arch,</b> with two semi-circular flights of stairs leading to the top two floors. This building fell into ruin when the cement works closed, and when it was eventually restored its appearance was radically altered, the ingenious original staircase being replaced with a simpler metal one. In the same area he created the Can Artigas Gardens between 1905 and 1907, in an area called Font de la Magnesia, commissioned by the textile merchant Joan Artigas i Alart; men who had worked the Park Güell were also involved on this project, similar to the famous park in Barcelona.|$|E

5|$|The present {{structure}} has many traces of great antiquity, being large and {{built in the}} form of a cross, with a door of early Gothic architecture. The building was probably erected some time after the Norman Conquest, as the plain <b>pointed</b> <b>arch</b> prevails throughout; exactly when we cannot be sure, though possibly after 1246. The earliest visible stonework is thirteenth century, in the tower and the arches supporting it. The external appearance of the church is large and ancient, being erected of rubble stone, with ashlar quoins and windows. The severe appearance and thick walls of the nave suggest Norman architecture, however the presence of pointed lancet windows indicate that it is early Gothic, perhaps from early thirteenth century. Internally the church is {{in the form of}} an aisleless cruciform church with substantial transepts. It was rebuilt (or built afresh) in the thirteenth century after a fire, and the chancel extended in the fifteenth century, after which the structure was largely complete as it is seen today.|$|E
5|$|The south transept's {{southern}} wall {{is nearly}} complete, displaying the fine workmanship {{of the first}} phase. It shows the Gothic <b>pointed</b> <b>arch</b> style in the windows that first appeared in France in the mid-12th century and was apparent in England around 1170, but hardly appeared in Scotland until the early 13th century. It also shows the round early Norman window design that continued {{to be used in}} Scotland during the entire Gothic period (Fig. 6). The windows and the quoins are of finely cut ashlar sandstone. A doorway in the south-west portion of the wall has large mouldings and has a pointed oval window placed above it. Adjacent to the doorway are two lancet-arched windows that are topped at the clerestory level with three round-headed windows. The north transept has much less of its structure preserved, but much of what does remain, taken together with a study by John Slezer in 1693, shows that it was similar to the south transept, except that the north transept had no external door and featured a stone turret containing a staircase.|$|E
5|$|The ancient font by {{the west}} door dates from the twelfth century, and has an arcaded basin. The plain <b>pointed</b> <b>arch</b> forms the only {{ornament}} on the font, which has an octagonal ashlar shaft now mounted on a platform, and supporting the octagonal basin. Unfortunately the font has been subject to extensive and clumsy repair. Unusually, it is made of Purbeck marble, which is normally found in churches in south and eastern England; the only other example in Wales is in St David's Cathedral. Documentary {{evidence suggests that the}} massive stem dates from at least the nineteenth century, and stylistic evidence suggests that it is probably a lot earlier; the font basin itself is undoubtedly ancient. Seddon's restoration work in the church commenced in 1869, and included dismantling the font. He carefully cleaned and stored the stonework, and re-erected it on new platform of Radyr conglomerate stone. Radyr Stone is a Triassic breccia used widely for decorative work in the Cardiff area, including Llandaff Cathedral, Cardiff Docks and in the bridges of the Taff Vale Railway. The font previously stood on a three step platform, in the same position as it now stands. The font cover is nineteenth century, in oak and wrought iron.|$|E

5|$|The {{southern}} side of {{the church}} has nine bays, again divided by buttresses. In the third bay from the west is a porch. The other bays each contain a two-light window with trefoil heads. The porch is in two storeys, with angle buttresses and a battlemented parapet with gargoyles. The lower storey contains a doorway with a <b>pointed</b> <b>arch,</b> and the upper storey has a two-light window. The doorway and window are set slightly {{to the west of}} the centre, as the east wall contains a stairway. Inside the porch are stone seats and the remains of two stoups (holy water fonts). The staircase leading to the upper storey is composed of old gravestones. On the outer wall of the upper storey is a sundial. The west end of the church is in Perpendicular style, and has five bays. At its centre is another porch, this one with three storeys. At the west front are diagonal buttresses, and in the bottom storey is a double doorway, over which is a canopied niche containing the weathered image of a saint. In the middle storey is a three-light window, in the top storey a two-light window, and at the summit is a battlemented parapet. There are windows in the north and south faces of the top stage, and on the north side is an octagonal stair turret. Inside the porch are four corbels (supporting brackets) carved with musicians. On each {{side of the}} porch is a four-light window. At the west end of the north aisle is a four-light window, and a five-light window is at the end of the south aisle.|$|E
