25|$|Birds which {{prefer the}} wetland habitat include kingfishers and bank swallows. Finally {{there is an}} {{abundance}} of bird life around the wetland marshes. Many species of ducks make their summer homes in these waters and Canada geese nest in the more remote marshes. Blackbirds, marsh wrens and black terns nest in the reeds. Franklin gulls nest in the marsh vegetation, but range over agricultural fields for grasshoppers, crickets, and mice. Shore birds include: avocet, <b>piping</b> <b>plover,</b> spotted sandpiper, willet, common snipe and killdeer.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{highlights}} of the summer is East Hampton Fire Department fireworks display at Main Beach, usually held the Saturday night closest to July 4. The fireworks displays have generated controversy since 2005, when they were postponed because they were considered disruptive to the nearby nesting of the endangered <b>piping</b> <b>plover.</b> In 2005, 2007, and 2008 the fireworks were postponed until Labor Day weekend to protect the birds' nesting season. The village administration has since postponed the fireworks display to Labor Day weekend indefinitely.|$|E

40|$|Endangered {{interior}} least terns (Sternula antillarum athalassos) {{and threatened}} northern Great Plains <b>piping</b> <b>plovers</b> (Charadrius melodus) nest together on midstream sandbars in large rivers {{in the interior}} of North America. We investigated the relationship between river channel width and tern and plover nesting incidence on the lower Platte River, Nebraska, using a model-based logistic regression analysis. Multiple channel width measurements and a long-term nesting data set were used in the analysis. Nesting incidence was positively associated with increasing river channel width proximal to the nesting site. At a greater distance, up to 802 m away from the nesting site, there was no relationship with channel width. Managers and regulators should use these results to aid decisions pertaining to habitat creation and assessing impacts of future projects. Future research should address whether relationships exist between river channel width and nest counts and reproductive rates of interior least tern and <b>piping</b> <b>plovers</b> on the lower Platte River...|$|R
