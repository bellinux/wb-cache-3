The term pesticide includes all of the following: herbicide, insecticide, [...] insect growth regulator, nematicide, termiticide, molluscicide, piscicide, avicide, rodenticide, predacide, bactericide, insect repellent, animal repellent, antimicrobial, fungicide, disinfectant (antimicrobial), and sanitizer.

40|$|The {{application}} rate of plant-protection products is indicated as a concentration or amount of product per area. Greenhouse crops grow swiftly, and an {{application rate}} {{based on a}} fixed amount of product per hectare can result either in large losses and overdoses when the plants are small or to be insufficient when the plants are fully developed. To solve these problems, the application rates of plant-protection products need to be adapted to the plant mass present in the greenhouse when the spray is applied. Two models were developed to estimate the leaf area based on easily measured geometric data of the vegetation in a greenhouse tomato crop. The model based on the PRV (Plant Row Volume) had that best results. The calculation of the volume application rate from the PRV {{has resulted in a}} reduction of more than 30 % of the quantity of <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> <b>product</b> sprayed, without decreasing yield. The PRV of a greenhouse tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) is an easily measured parameter that enables the estimation of the leaf area index and the use of application strategies adapted to the changes in the plant canopy, saving major amounts of <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> <b>product</b> used, compared to the conventional system...|$|R

30|$|Permanent {{excitation}} {{of nerve}} cells {{due to the}} absence of negative regulation is another example of the impact of xenobiotics on one or several control elements of signal transduction. Neurotransmitters in the brain are stimulated via the opening of specific ion channels to allow sodium ions to flow into the nerve cell. If required, this activity is modulated or inhibited by chlorine ions which likewise flow into nerve cells through specific channels. Lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane), which formerly was used as a <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> <b>product,</b> prevents the influx of these chlorine ions by inhibiting the opening of the relevant ion channels. This results in permanent excitation as mentioned above [9].|$|R

40|$|Populations of two molluscs, {{the land}} snail Arianta arbustorum and the Iberian slug Arion lusitanicus, have {{increased}} substantially {{in many places}} in the northern Fennoscandia in recent years. This has resulted in considerable aesthetic and economic damage to plants in home gardens and commercial nurseries. Birch tar oil (BTO), is a new biological <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> <b>product,</b> and was tested against these molluscs. In this study we examined whether 2 types of BTO, used either alone, mixed together, or mixed with Vaseline®, could be applied as 1) a biological <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> <b>product</b> for the control of land snails by direct topical spray application, 2) as a repellent against snails when painted on a Perspex® fence, and 3) as a repellent against slugs when smeared on pots containing Brassica pekinensis seedlings. Both the fences and the pots with seedlings were placed in each field with a high population of the target organism. When applied as a spray on snails, BTO did not act as a toxic pesticide but rendered the snails inactive {{for a period of}} several months. The BTO barriers were effective in repelling both snails and slugs. However, the repellent effect of BTO alone against the molluscs was short-term. Repeated treatments were required to keep the slugs away from the plants and we found that the interval between treatments should not exceed two weeks. A collar fastened around the rim of the pots, combined with the BTO treatment, did not give any additional benefit in hindering slugs from invading the plants. Most noticeably, the BTO+Vaseline® mixture prevented the land snails from passing over the treated fences for up to several months. The results of these experiments provide evidence that BTO, especially when mixed with Vaseline®, serves as an excellent long-term repellent against molluscs. ...|$|R
