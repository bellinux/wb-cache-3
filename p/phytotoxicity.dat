50|$|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) {{guidelines}} describe toxicity testing using L. gibba or L. minor as test organisms. Both {{of these}} species have been studied extensively for use in <b>phytotoxicity</b> tests. Genetic variability in responses to toxicants can occur in Lemna, and data are insufficient to recommend a specific clone for testing. The US EPA test uses aseptic technique. The OECD test is not conducted axenically, but steps are taken at stages during the test procedure to keep contamination by other organisms to a minimum. Depending on {{the objectives of the}} test and the regulatory requirements, testing may be performed with renewal (semistatic and flow-through) or without renewal (static) of the test solution. Renewal is useful for substances that are rapidly lost from solution as a result of volatilisation, photodegradation, precipitation, or biodegradation.|$|E
50|$|Mulch {{normally}} {{smells like}} freshly cut wood, but sometimes develops a toxicity that causes it to smell like vinegar, ammonia, sulfur or silage. This happens when material with ample nitrogen content is not rotated often enough and it forms pockets of increased decomposition. When this occurs, the process may become anaerobic and produce these phytotoxic materials in small quantities. Once {{exposed to the}} air, the process quickly reverts to an aerobic process, but these toxic materials may be present {{for a period of}} time. If the mulch is placed around plants before the toxicity has had a chance to dissipate, then the plants could very likely be damaged or killed depending on their hardiness. Plants that are predominantly low to the ground or freshly planted are the most susceptible, and the <b>phytotoxicity</b> may prevent germination of some seeds.|$|E
50|$|Very {{little work}} has been done to {{elucidate}} the biosynthetic pathways of betaenones with almost no literature references published on the subject since 1988. Their low <b>phytotoxicity</b> and lack of biological significance in human physiology has provoked a fairly small amount of interest in these compounds. The backbone carbon units of betaenone B are known to be synthesized via the polyketide synthesis (PKS) pathway. The backbone is synthesized through the addition of two carbon units via addition of acetate units from acetyl-CoA. The 5 methyl groups are added via S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) methylation, as opposed to incorporation of propionate (instead of acetate) to the growing compound during biosynthesis. The following internal cyclization proceeds through a Diels-Alder reaction catalyzed by an unknown enzyme. The origin of the subsequent oxidations at positions 1, 2 and 8 have yet to be characterized, but they have been shown not to originate from acetate. It has been theorized that cytochrome P-450 is responsible for the oxidation at these three positions since its inhibition produces probetaenone 1, the non-oxidized form of betaenone B.|$|E
50|$|Betaenone B, {{like other}} betaenones (A and C), is a {{secondary}} metabolite {{isolated from the}} fungus Pleospora betae, a plant pathogen. Its phytotoxic properties {{have been shown to}} cause sugar beet leaf spots, which is characterized by black, pycnidia containing, concentric circles eventually leading to necrosis of the leaf tissue. Of the seven phytotoxins isolated in fungal leaf spots from sugar beet (Beta vulgaris), betaenone B showed the least amount of <b>phytotoxicity</b> showing only 8% inhibition of growth while betaenone A and C showed 73% and 89% growth inhibition, respectively. Betaenone B is therefore not considered toxic to the plant, but will produce leaf spots when present in high concentrations (0.33 µg/µL). While the mechanism of action of betaenone B has yet to be elucidated, betaenone C has been shown to inhibit RNA and protein synthesis. Most of the major work on betaenone B, including the initial structure elucidation of betaenone A, B and C as well as the partial elucidation mechanism of biosynthesis, was presented in three short papers published between 1983-88. The compounds were found to inhibit a variety of protein kinases signifying a possible role in cancer treatment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{principal}} {{environmental issues}} associated with runoff are the impacts to surface water, groundwater and soil through transport of water pollutants to these systems. Ultimately these consequences translate into human health risk, ecosystem disturbance and aesthetic impact to water resources. Some of the contaminants that create the greatest impact to surface waters arising from runoff are petroleum substances, herbicides and fertilizers. Quantitative uptake by surface runoff of pesticides and other contaminants has been studied since the 1960s, and early on contact of pesticides with water was known to enhance <b>phytotoxicity.</b> [...] In the case of surface waters, the impacts translate to water pollution, since the streams and rivers have received runoff carrying various chemicals or sediments. When surface waters are used as potable water supplies, they can be compromised regarding health risks and drinking water aesthetics (that is, odor, color and turbidity effects). Contaminated surface waters risk altering the metabolic processes of the aquatic species that they host; these alterations can lead to death, such as fish kills, or alter the balance of populations present. Other specific impacts are on animal mating, spawning, egg and larvae viability, juvenile survival and plant productivity. Some researches show surface runoff of pesticides, such as DDT, can alter the gender of fish species genetically, which transforms male into female fish.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first thing}} {{recommendation}} {{to control the}} gall nematodes is to plant healthy seeds in area not infested. Nematode-free seeds are important to avoid disseminating the pathogen to other areas. However, if areas are already contaminated, other measures will be needed.Some nematicides are still applied to stop J2 from infecting coffee plants. However, due <b>phytotoxicity</b> and high value their use became unpractical. Thus, new cultural methods started to be applied such as irrigation control, remove diseased plants, spacing rows and others not as common. M. exigua can survive for six months without the host, while M. coffeicola just survive for few days or weeks. Thus, not planting host plants for a period greater than six months can eradicate both plant feeders. Grafting [...] is another method applied to control Meloidogyne species that attacks coffee. Resistant varieties are used as a support (stock) such Apoatã, which will provide nutrients to the other variety on the top (scion) such Mundo Novo, {{that will be the}} one with flower and coffee fruit production. It is an easier method, that does not harm the environment. Other cultivar that is used to control M. exigua is IAPAR 59. It carries Mex-1 resistance gene, that causes Hypersensitive Response (HR) in the plant, also having low reproductive factor to M. exigua. This is a competitive variety with good agronomic factors.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, {{nanotechnology}} {{application to}} biotechnology will also leave no field untouched by its groundbreaking scientific innovations for human wellness; the agricultural industry is no exception. Basically, nanomaterials are distinguished {{depending on the}} origin: natural, incidental and engineered nanoparticles. Among these, engineered nanoparticles have received wide attention in all fields of science, including medical, materials and agriculture technology with significant socio-economical growth.In the agriculture industry, engineered nanoparticles have been serving as nano carrier, containing herbicides, chemicals, or genes, which target particular plant parts to release their content. Previously nanocapsules containing herbicides {{have been reported to}} effectively penetrate through cuticles and tissues, allowing the slow and constant release of the active substances. Likewise, other literature describes that nano-encapsulated slow release of fertilizers has also become a trend to save fertilizer consumption and to minimize environmental pollution through precision farming. These are only a few examples from numerous research works which might open up exciting opportunities for nanobiotechnology application in agriculture. Also, application of this kind of engineered nanoparticles to plants should be considered the level of amicability before it is employed in agriculture practices. Based on a thorough literature survey, it was understood that there is only limited authentic information available to explain the biological consequence of engineered nanoparticles on treated plants. Certain reports underline the <b>phytotoxicity</b> of various origin of engineered nanoparticles to the plant caused by the subject of concentrations and sizes [...] At the same time, however, an equal number of studies were reported with a positive outcome of nanoparticles, which facilitate growth promoting nature to treat plant. In particular, compared to other nanoparticles, silver and gold nanoparticles based applications elicited beneficial results on various plant species with less and/or no toxicity. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) treated leaves of Asparagus showed the increased content of ascorbate and chlorophyll. Similarly, AgNPs-treated common bean and corn has increased shoot and root length, leaf surface area, chlorophyll, carbohydrate and protein contents reported earlier. The gold nanoparticle has been used to induce growth and seed yield in Brassica juncea.|$|E

30|$|The seed {{germination}} index (GI) {{has been defined}} as a factor of relative {{seed germination}} and relative root elongation (Moharana and Biswas 2016). It was reported that immature and unstable composts cause <b>phytotoxicity</b> affecting seed germination and root growth and thus result in lower seed GIs (Raj and Antil 2011; Awasthi et al. 2014). Previous research efforts show that a GI value of 80 % indicates maturity of the compost and the absence of <b>phytotoxicity</b> (Tiquia 2005; Huang et al. 2006). In the present study, when this observation was used as a benchmark to determine the <b>phytotoxicity</b> of the composts, results showed that finger millet straw compost at 100 % extract application (no dilution) exhibited <b>phytotoxicity</b> in tomato and soybean resulting in[*]<[*] 80 % of GI.

30|$|Four {{concentrations}} of SA and MeJA {{did not show}} any symptoms of <b>phytotoxicity</b> against tomato plants.

30|$|In {{addition}} to physico-chemical analyses, maturity {{can also be}} {{measured in terms of}} germination index (GI) which is based on relatively simple <b>phytotoxicity</b> tests. <b>Phytotoxicity</b> tests are actually germination bioassays that quantify seed growth after the application of compost liquid extracts to the seeds; GI is calculated by the root length and the percentage of germination of selected test plant seeds compared to a control (control is commonly tested using deionized water). The GI of any compost aids in determining the level of toxicity, i.e., low levels of toxicity mainly affects root growth, while high levels of toxicity, affect seed germination. Therefore, GIs lower than 100 % indicate potential <b>phytotoxicity,</b> while values greater than 100 % indicate a positive effect on seed growth, and thus signify a mature compost. A <b>phytotoxicity</b> test does not reveal the underlying reasons for the compost’s toxicity but serves only as an indirect measure for quantification of the toxicity for seed growth. <b>Phytotoxicity</b> in the compost extract can be typically due to the presence of partially degraded organic acids, fermentation intermediates, ammonia, salts and heavy metals.|$|E
40|$|In the {{production}} of ornamental plants, it is often necessary to combine plant protection products (PPPs) for simultaneous pest control.
