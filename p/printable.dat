5|$|ROT47 is a {{derivative}} of ROT13 which, {{in addition to}} scrambling the basic letters, also treats numbers and common symbols. Instead of using the sequence A–Z as the alphabet, ROT47 uses a larger set of characters from the common character encoding known as ASCII. Specifically, the 7-bit <b>printable</b> characters, excluding space, from decimal 33 '!' through 126 '~', 94 in total, taken {{in the order of}} the numerical values of their ASCII codes, are rotated by 47 positions, without special consideration of case. For example, the character A is mapped to p, while a is mapped to 2. The use of a larger alphabet produces a more thorough obfuscation than that of ROT13; for example, a telephone number such as +1-415-839-6885 is not obvious at first sight from the scrambled result Z`\c`d\gbh\eggd. On the other hand, because ROT47 introduces numbers and symbols into the mix without discrimination, it is more immediately obvious that the text has been enciphered.|$|E
25|$|Particularly vexing was the Selectric's {{lack of a}} full ASCII {{character}} set. The late Bob Bemer {{wrote that}} while working for IBM he lobbied unsuccessfully to expand the typing element to 64 characters from 44. The Selectric actually provided 44 characters per case, but the point remains that with 88 <b>printable</b> characters it could not quite produce the full <b>printable</b> ASCII character set.|$|E

25|$|In August 2013, MakerBot {{released}} the Digitizer, a 3D scanner. The product {{was designed to}} allow MakerBot users to scan physical objects {{and turn them into}} digital, 3D <b>printable</b> models. The accompanying software allowed models to be edited, printed immediately, or uploaded to Thingiverse.|$|E
25|$|MakerBot {{hosts the}} online {{community}} Thingiverse, where users can upload 3D <b>printable</b> files, document designs, and collaborate 3D printing projects and on open source hardware. The {{site is a}} collaborative repository for design files used in 3D printing, laser cutting and other DIY manufacturing processes.|$|E
25|$|Because {{national}} keyboard implementations vary, not all 94 ASCII <b>printable</b> characters {{can be used}} everywhere. This {{can present}} a problem to an international traveler who wished to log into remote system using a keyboard on a local computer. See keyboard layout. Many hand held devices, such as tablet computers and smart phones, require complex shift sequences to enter special characters.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the factors}} {{that led to the}} {{emergence}} of omoshirogara/propaganda kimonos, three stand out: the introduction of modern textile manufacturing and printing equipment into Japan in the late 19th century allowed textile manufacturers to produce <b>printable</b> apparel fabric more quickly and cheaply; the social and political impetus for Japan to modernize; and, following the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the political leadership's desire to rally the population in support of Japan's colonial expansion and, eventually, its war against the Allies.|$|E
25|$|Printed {{electronics}} is {{the manufacturing}} of electronic devices using standard printing processes. Printed electronics {{technology can be}} produced on cheap materials such as paper or flexible film, which makes it an extremely cost-effective method of production. Since early 2010, the <b>printable</b> electronics industry has been gaining momentum and several large companies, including Bemis Company and Illinois Tool Works have made investments in printed electronics and industry associations including OE-A and FlexTech Alliance are contributing heavily {{to the advancement of}} the printed electronics industry.|$|E
25|$|Netascii is a {{modified}} form of ASCII, defined in RFC 764. It {{consists of an}} 8-bit extension of the 7-bit ASCII character space from 0x20 to 0x7F (the <b>printable</b> characters and the space) and eight of the control characters. The allowed control characters include the null (0x00), the line feed (LF, 0x0A), and the carriage return (CR, 0x0D). Netascii also requires {{that the end of}} line marker on a host be translated to the character pair CR LF for transmission, and that any CR must be followed by either a LF or the null.|$|E
25|$|Also, 3D {{printing}} as {{a production}} technique gains {{more and more}} importance. With {{a great variety of}} services offering this production method, jewellery design becomes accessible to a growing number of creatives. An important advantage of using 3d printing are the relatively low costs for prototypes, small batch series or unique and personalized designs. Shapes that are hard or impossible to create by hand can often be realized by 3D printing. Popular materials to print include Polyamide, steel and wax (latter for further processing). Every <b>printable</b> material has its very own constraints that have to be considered while designing the piece of jewellery using 3D Modelling Software.|$|E
25|$|Reducing defects on extreme {{ultraviolet}} (EUV) masks is currently {{one of the}} most critical issues to be addressed for commercialization of EUV lithography. Defects can be buried underneath or within the multilayer stack or be on top of the multilayer stack. Mesas or protrusions form on the sputtering targets used for multilayer deposition, which may fall off as particles during the multilayer deposition. In fact, defects of atomic scale height (0.3–0.5nm) with 100nm FWHM can still be <b>printable</b> by exhibiting 10% CD impact. IBM and Toppan reported at Photomask Japan 2015 that smaller defects, e.g., 50nm size, can have 10% CD impact even with 0.6nm height, yet remain undetectable.|$|E
25|$|Braille {{has been}} {{extended}} to an 8-dot code, particularly for use with braille embossers and refreshable braille displays. In 8-dot braille the additional dots are added {{at the bottom of}} the cell, giving a matrix 4 dots high by 2 dots wide. The additional dots are given the numbers 7 (for the lower-left dot) and 8 (for the lower-right dot). Eight-dot braille has the advantages that the case of an individual letter is directly coded in the cell containing the letter and that all the <b>printable</b> ASCII characters can be represented in a single cell. All 256 (28) possible combinations of 8 dots are encoded by the Unicode standard. Braille with six dots is frequently stored as Braille ASCII.|$|E
25|$|The Boondock Saints {{has been}} {{released}} numerous times on DVD, including an import on March 13, 2001 and an uncut Japanese release published by Toshiba Entertainment, whose special features include anamorphic widescreen, audio commentary, trailers, and interviews with the Japanese media. On May 23, 2006 The Boondock Saints Collector's Edition was published and released by 20th Century Fox on DVD, as well as UMD for the PlayStation Portable. The special features include English and Spanish subtitles, commentary by Billy Connolly and Troy Duffy, deleted scenes and outtakes. It also featured the film's trailer, cast and crew filmographies, and a <b>printable</b> script of the film. 20th Century Fox and Duffy showed an interest in doing a new audio commentary for the special release, but {{he was unable to}} because of unresolved legal issues.|$|E
25|$|Viacom put $100 million toward online gaming initiatives, {{such as a}} subscription-based {{educational}} {{site called}} MyNoggin, in July 2007. The MyNoggin website was initially scheduled to launch in early September of that year, but was not {{made available to the}} public until October. The site's content was curriculum-based and intended for children in preschool through first grade. The games on MyNoggin covered major school subjects and included Noggin characters. In addition to activities, MyNoggin included <b>printable</b> workbooks that expanded upon math and science concepts. Parents were able to monitor their children's growth and activity on the site through daily progress reports. The website was free of advertisements and supported by subscriptions, which were available for online purchase and through prepaid game cards sold throughout 2008. Charter, Insight and Cox Communications customers were given unlimited access to MyNoggin as part of their cable subscriptions. The site also offered a week-long free trial.|$|E
25|$|In certain circumstances, {{a target}} process will filter any byte from the {{injected}} shellcode {{that is not}} a <b>printable</b> or alphanumeric character. Under such circumstances, the range of instructions {{that can be used to}} write a shellcode becomes very limited. A solution to this problem was published by Rix in Phrack 57 in which he showed it was possible to turn any code into alphanumeric code. A technique often used is to create self-modifying code, because this allows the code to modify its own bytes to include bytes outside of the normally allowed range, thereby expanding the range of instructions it can use. Using this trick, a self-modifying decoder can be created that initially uses only bytes in the allowed range. The main code of the shellcode is encoded, also only using bytes in the allowed range. When the output shellcode is run, the decoder can modify its own code to be able to use any instruction it requires to function properly and then continues to decode the original shellcode. After decoding the shellcode the decoder transfers control to it, so it can be executed as normal. It has been shown that it is possible to create arbitrarily complex shellcode that looks like normal text in English.|$|E

2500|$|... {{mnemonic}} passwords: Some users develop mnemonic {{phrases and}} use them to generate more or less random passwords which are nevertheless relatively easy for the user to remember. For instance, the first letter of each word in a memorable phrase. Research estimates the password strength of such passwords to be about 3.7 bits per character, compared to the 6.6 bits for random passwords from ASCII <b>printable</b> characters. Silly ones are possibly more memorable. Another way to make random-appearing passwords more memorable is to use random words (see diceware) or syllables instead of randomly chosen letters.|$|E
2500|$|... 3D <b>printable</b> models may {{be created}} with a {{computer-aided}} design (CAD) package, via a 3D scanner, or by a plain digital camera and photogrammetry software. 3D printed models created with CAD result in reduced errors {{and can be}} corrected before printing, allowing verification {{in the design of}} the object before it is printed.

2500|$|In 2005, Sarah Boxer of The New York Times {{stated that}} the {{infinite}} canvas {{was hard to find}} in use, as many webcomic were sticking to a <b>printable</b> format. A few, however, like Nicholas Gurewitch's The Perry Bible Fellowship and Drew Weing's Pup, did make use of the format (Pup won a Web Cartoonists' Choice Award in the [...] "infinite canvas" [...] category in 2005). Boxer pointed out that most popular webcomics either fit on a webpage easily [...] such as Adrian Ramos's Count Your Sheep [...] or attempted to use various aspects of the digital medium, such as Flash animation and music. That same year, Joe Zabel also noted that the primary purpose for the infinite canvas would be to create lengthy and deep works on the Web, while comic strips like PvP and Penny Arcade showed to have much more success in this environment. Because of the time that would go into any page of an infinite canvas comic, Zabel deemed it unlikely for such webcomics to gain a large popularity. Journalist Eric Burns, meanwhile, claimed that McCloud was mainly discussing the potential of webcomics, rather than what they are actually like.|$|E
