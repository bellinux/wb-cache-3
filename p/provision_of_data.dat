However, researchers must assess those data collected from both primary and secondary data sources to enable the accuracy, updates and fairness.

The system is by itself not moving towards any sort of balance between forces, but is constantly on the move away from such a situationMyrdal used the expressions ‘approach’, ‘theory’ and ‘general theory’ as synonyms. In his subsequent writings, however, he mainly referred to ‘approach’, defining it as something containing, among other things, theories. He wrote that by this term he meant a collection of devices, like ‘the concepts, models, and theories we use, {{and the way in which}} we select and arrange observations and present the results of our research’.|$|E

50|$|Deployments of Lorenzo {{have not}} been without {{reported}} teething troubles. Delays in the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> to NHS England's waiting list system were linked to Lorenzo implementations in an HSJ article in May 2014. Tameside Hospital NHS Foundation Trust’s April risk register awarded its Lorenzo project the highest possible risk rating - 25 - citing “potential risks to patient safety quality, information governance and performance trajectories”. Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust's May 2014 board meeting noted it {{had been forced to}} “recruit 25 additional staff” to address “a number of issues which have arisen as Lorenzo moves to business as usual”, including “backlogs, clinic restructuring and un-outcomed outpatient clinic forms”. Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust’s May 2014 risk register said plans to deploy Lorenzo might be “unrealistic”, and that it had “insufficient capacity and insufficient funding” to support the project.|$|E
50|$|Model {{organism}} databases (MODs) are biological databases {{dedicated to}} the provision of in-depth biological data for intensively studied model organisms. MODs allow researchers to easily find background information on large sets of genes, plan experiments efficiently, combine their data with existing knowledge, and construct novel hypotheses. They allow users to analyse results and interpret datasets, and the data they generate are increasingly used to describe less well studied species. Where possible, MODs share common approaches to collect and represent biological information. For example, all MODs use the Gene Ontology to describe functions, processes and cellular locations of specific gene products. Projects also exist to enable software sharing for curation, visualization and querying between different MODs. Organismal diversity and varying user requirements however mean that MODs are often required to customize capture, display, and <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>data.</b>|$|E
