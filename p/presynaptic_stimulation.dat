40|$|Synaptic {{plasticity}} {{is assumed}} to underlie various forms of learning and memory. The classical theory believes that high-frequency <b>presynaptic</b> <b>stimulation</b> will induce long-term potentiation and low-frequency <b>presynaptic</b> <b>stimulation</b> will induce long-term depression, which are two forms of synaptic plasticity. Recently, for the first time, postsynaptic hyperpolarisation gated bidirectional plasticity was demonstrated in vestibular nerve synapses in the vestibular nucleus. In this system, the inhibitory Purkinje cells in the cerebellum can regulate the strength of excitatory neurotransmission in the vestibular nucleus neurons that they project to. This new type of plasticity is fully compatible with the proposed mechanism underlying motor learning during adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex and can enhance our understanding of other forms of motor learning. However, the mechanistic cellular and molecular mechanisms behind this novel form of plasticity remain unknown. Here, I present a multi-scale model of hyperpolarisation mediated synaptic plasticity. This combines an electrical model of medial vestibular nucleus type B neurons in the vestibulo-ocular reflex system and comprehensive biochemical model of signalling pathway that underlies synaptic plasticity. In my model, I uncovered a complex relationship between Ca 2 + concentration and synaptic strength. Then I found that <b>presynaptic</b> <b>stimulation</b> paired with hyperpolarisation can induce large amount of Ca 2 + influx through low-voltage activated calcium channels, resulting in potentiation, and <b>presynaptic</b> <b>stimulation</b> without hyperpolarisation induce small amount of Ca 2 + influx, resulting in depression. My finding reveals the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this novel plasticity and deepens our mechanistic understanding of motor learning...|$|E
40|$|Synapses in {{the brain}} are bidirectionally modifiable, but the routes of {{induction}} are diverse. In various experimental paradigms, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-dependent long-term depression and long-term potentiation have been induced selectively by varying the membrane potential of the postsynaptic neurons during <b>presynaptic</b> <b>stimulation</b> of a constant frequency, the rate of <b>presynaptic</b> <b>stimulation,</b> and the timing of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials. In this paper, we present a mathematical embodiment of bidirectional synaptic plasticity that is able to explain diverse induction protocols with a fixed set of parameters. The key assumptions and consequences of the model can be tested experimentally; further, the model provides {{the foundation for a}} unified theory of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity...|$|E
40|$|SummaryTiming-dependent LTP (t-LTP) is a physiologically {{relevant}} type of {{synaptic plasticity}} {{that results from}} repeated sequential firing of action potentials (APs) in pre- and postsynaptic neurons. t-LTP can be observed in vivo and is proposed to be a cellular correlate of memory formation. While brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is essential to high-frequency stimulation-induced LTP in many brain areas, the role of BDNF in t-LTP is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate a striking change in the expression mechanism of t-LTP in CA 1 of the hippocampus following two distinct modes of synaptic activation. Single postsynaptic APs paired with <b>presynaptic</b> <b>stimulation</b> activated a BDNF-independent canonical t-LTP. In contrast, a theta burst of postsynaptic APs preceded by <b>presynaptic</b> <b>stimulation</b> elicited BDNF-dependent postsynaptic t-LTP that relied on postsynaptic BDNF secretion. This suggests that BDNF release during burst-like patterns of activity typically observed in vivo may {{play a crucial role}} during memory formation...|$|E

We report on spike-timing-dependent plasticity of inhibitory synapses in the entorhinal cortex. After pairing <b>presynaptic</b> <b>stimulations</b> at time tpre with evoked postsynaptic spikes at time tpost under pharmacological blockade of excitation we found, via whole cell recordings, an asymmetrical timing rule for plasticity of the remaining inhibitory responses. Strength of response varied {{as a function of}} the time interval {Delta}t = tpost tpre: for {Delta}t > 0 inhibitory responses potentiated, peaking at a delay of 10 ms. For {Delta}t < 0, the synaptic coupling depressed, again with a maximal effect near 10 ms of delay. We also show that changes in synaptic strength depend on changes in intracellular calcium concentrations and demonstrate that the calcium enters the postsynaptic cell through voltage-gated channels. Using network models, we demonstrate how this novel form of plasticity can sculpt network behavior efficiently and with remarkable flexibility...|$|R
40|$|Long term {{potentiation}} (LTP), {{an activity}} induced alternation in synaptic efficiency, is a phenomena {{that occurs in}} the hippocampus and {{other regions of the}} brain and is thought to be the basis of memory and learning. (12, 3, 11). Activities that induce LTP include tetanic <b>stimulation</b> of <b>presynaptic</b> neurons at very high frequencies (100 Hz) that synapse onto dendrites and pairing low frequency sub threshold <b>presynaptic</b> <b>stimulations</b> with a depolarization of the post synaptic membrane. (12). LTP is defined by three properties being cooperativity, associativity, and input-specificity. Cooperativity refers to the fact that a threshold number of presynaptic fibers must be activated in order to induce the increase in synaptic strength. Associativity of LTP means that a weak stimulus can stimulate LTP if it occurs concurrently with a converging supra-threshold stimulus. LTP is input specific because pathways that are not activated {{at the time of the}} tetanus do not induce the increase in synaptic strength that occurs. (12) In particular, Bliss and Lomo showed that LTP occurs when the post synaptic membrane receiving stimulation is sufficiently depolarized. (12) Previous studies have shown that LTP is mediated through N-methyl-D-aspartat...|$|R

Here, we use a simple in vitro monosynaptic Helix neuron connection, reproducing an in vivo physiological connection as a reliable experimental model to investigate the effects of Syn knockdown. Cells overexpressing an antisense construct against Helix Syn showed a time-dependent decrease of Syn immunostaining, confirming protein loss. At the morphological level, Syn-silenced cells showed a reduction in neurite linear outgrowth and branching and in the size and number of synaptic varicosities. Functionally, Syn-silenced cells presented a reduced ability to form synaptic connections; however, functional chemical synapses showed similar basal excitatory postsynaptic potentials and similar short-term plasticity paradigms. In addition, Syn-silenced cells presented faster neurotransmitter release and decreased postsynaptic response toward the end of long tetanic <b>presynaptic</b> <b>stimulations,</b> probably related to an impairment of the synaptic vesicle trafficking resulting from a different vesicle handling, with an increased readily releasable pool and a compromised reserve pool...|$|R

40|$|Synaptic {{rules that}} may {{determine}} {{the interaction between}} coexisting forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) at glutamatergic central synapses remain unknown. Here, we show that two mechanistically distinct forms of LTP could be induced in thalamic input to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) with an identical <b>presynaptic</b> <b>stimulation</b> protocol, depending {{on the level of}} postsynaptic membrane polarization. One form of LTP, resulting from pairing of postsynaptic depolarization and low-frequency <b>presynaptic</b> <b>stimulation,</b> was both induced and expressed postsynaptically (“post-LTP”). The same stimulation in the absence of postsynaptic depolarization led to LTP, which was induced and expressed presynaptically (“pre-LTP”). The inducibility of coexisting pre- and postsynaptic forms of LTP at synapses in thalamic input followed a well-defined hierarchical order, such that pre-LTP was suppressed when post-LTP was induced. This interaction was mediated by activation of cannabinoid type 1 receptors by endogenous cannabinoids released in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala in response to activation of the type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor. These results suggest a previously unknown mechanism by which the hierarchy of coexisting forms of long-term synaptic plasticity in the neural circuits of learned fear could be established, possibly reflecting the hierarchy of memories for the previously experienced fearful events according to their aversiveness level...|$|E
40|$|Recent results about {{dendritic}} computation {{of responses}} to <b>presynaptic</b> <b>stimulations</b> have {{raised a lot of}} interest. In particular, the integration of postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) exhibits non-linearities depending on their location on dendrites, even before it reaches the soma [1]. This implies important implications for spike processing at the scale of the whole neuron, when stimulated by many input spike trains via distributed synapses. Here we examine a specific aspect of dendritic non-linearities related to spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Under STDP, synapses are strengthened or weakened depending on the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic spikes at the scale of milliseconds. The resulting learning dynamics can dramatically shape the distribution of synaptic weights, which in turn modifies the neuronal response to its inputs [2]. We investigate the interplay between dendritic non-linearities, weight distributions and STDP-based learning, in order to evaluate whether their combined effects can be useful in terms of spiking computation. We develop a mathematical analysis using the Poisson neuron model (spiking neuron) and a phenomenological model of STDP that describes the weight update using a learning window function [3]. The synaptic competition depends on properties of the STDP learning window, non-linear PSP integration, and stimulating inputs (in particular, the input spike-time correlations). As a first step, we constrain the present study to a configuration where pools of input spike trains with (narrow) temporal correlations excite certain groups of synapses. In addition, we assume linearity in the summation of PSPs for proximal (basal) synapses, whereas PSPs on dista...|$|R
40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{performed}} each in six normal volunteers {{in order to}} find evidence of either a physiological or pharmacological role of presynaptic alpha- and presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors in man. In Study 1 subjects received a 60 min infusion of guanfacine 3 mg (alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonist) preceded by either idazoxan (alpha 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist) or vehicle. Guanfacine reduced plasma noradrenaline concentration by approximately 30 % and this fall was not antagonised by the alpha 2 -receptor antagonist. The 30 -fold increase in plasma growth hormone, measured as a marker of the central action of guanfacine, was almost completely blocked by idazoxan. A comparison of the drug concentrations of idazoxan and guanfacine, together with their relative affinities for alpha 2 -adrenoceptors, suggested that the idazoxan could not block the peripheral actions of guanfacine and that these were responsible for the fall in plasma noradrenaline concentration. In Study 2 adrenaline 0. 05 micrograms kg- 1 min- 1 was infused for 80 min preceded by either idazoxan or vehicle. After vehicle, adrenaline caused no change in plasma noradrenaline concentration whereas it rose approximately 25 % after administration of idazoxan.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the presence of functional glycine receptors (GlyRs) in hippocampus. In this work, we examine the baseline activity and activity-dependent modulation of GlyRs in region CA 1. We find that strychnine-sensitive GlyRs are open in the resting CA 1 pyramidal cell, creating a state of tonic inhibition that “shunts ” the magnitude of EPSPs evoked by electrical stimulation of the Schaffer collateral inputs. This GlyR-mediated shunting conductance is independent of the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>stimulation</b> rate; however, pairs of presynaptic and postsynaptic action potentials, repeated at frequencies above 5 Hz, reduce the GlyR-mediated conductance and increase peak EPSP magnitudes to levels at least 20 % larger than those seen with <b>presynaptic</b> <b>stimulation</b> alone. We refer to this phenomenon as rate-dependent efficacy (RDE). Exogenous GlyR agonists (glycine, taurine) block RDE by preventing the closure of postsynaptic GlyRs. The GlyR antagonist strychnine blocks postsynaptic GlyRs under all conditions, occluding RDE. During RDE, GlyRs are less responsive to local glycine application, suggesting that {{a reduction in the}} number or sensitivity of membrane-inserted GlyRs underlies RDE. By extending the RDE induction protocol to include 500 paired presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes, we can induce long-term synaptic depression (LTD). Manipulations that lead to reduced functionality of GlyRs, either pharmacologically or through RDE, also lead to increased LTD. This result suggests that RDE contributes to long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Key words: glycine; long-term depression; CA 1; hippocampus; frequency; patch clam...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCurrent {{concepts}} of memory storage are {{largely based on}} Hebbian-type synaptic long-term potentiation induced by concurrent activity of pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Little is known about non-Hebbian synaptic plasticity, which, if present in nociceptive pathways, could resolve a number of unexplained findings. We performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rat spinal cord slices and found that a rise in postsynaptic [Ca 2 +]i due to postsynaptic depolarization was sufficient to induce synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) {{in the absence of}} any <b>presynaptic</b> conditioning <b>stimulation.</b> LTP induction could be prevented by postsynaptic application of the Ca 2 + chelator BAPTA (1, 2 -bis(o-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid), the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) antagonist nifedipine, and by postsynaptic application of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK 801. This indicates that synaptic potentiation was induced postsynaptically by Ca 2 + entry likely via L-type voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels (VGCC) and via NMDA receptor channels. The paired pulse ratio and the coefficient of variation remained unchanged in neurons expressing LTP, suggesting that this form of synaptic potentiation was not only induced, but also expressed postsynaptically. Postsynaptic depolarization had no influence on firing patterns, action potential shape, or neuronal excitability. An increase in [Ca 2 +]i in spinal lamina I neurons induces a non-Hebbian form of synaptic plasticity in spinal nociceptive pathways without affecting neuronal active and passive membrane properties...|$|R

GABA reduced the amplitude of the fast excitatory postsynaptic potential e. p. s. p.) without changing the amplitude of the nicotinic response to ionophoretic application of acetylcholine (ACh). This effect was mimicked by baclofen (10 - 100 microM) and was not blocked by bicuculline (10 microM). The preparation did not become desensitized during prolonged GABA applications. Cholinergic and non-cholinergic slow e. p. s. ps evoked by single or repetitive <b>presynaptic</b> nerve <b>stimulation</b> were reduced in amplitude by GABA.

This effect was also mimicked by baclofen, was insensitive to bicuculline and was not reduced with repeated application or GABA.

During olfactory classical conditioning, large subsets of dopaminergic neurons are activated, releasing dopamine across broad sets of postsynaptic neurons. It is unclear how such diffuse dopamine release generates the highly localized patterns of plasticity required for memory formation. ResultsHere we have mapped spatial patterns of dopaminergic modulation of intracellular signaling and plasticity in Drosophila mushroom body (MB) neurons, combining <b>presynaptic</b> thermogenetic <b>stimulation</b> of dopaminergic neurons with postsynaptic functional imaging in vivo. Stimulation of dopaminergic neurons generated increases in cyclic AMP (cAMP) across multiple spatial regions in the MB. However, odor presentation paired with stimulation of dopaminergic neurons evoked plasticity in Ca 2 + responses in discrete spatial patterns. These patterns of plasticity correlated with behavioral requirements for each set of MB neurons in aversive and appetitive conditioning. Finally, broad elevation of cAMP differentially facilitated responses in the gamma lobe, suggesting {{that it is more}} sensitive to elevations of cAMP and that it is recruited first into dopamine-dependent memory traces. ConclusionsThese data suggest that the spatial pattern of learning-related plasticity is dependent on the postsynaptic neurons’ sensitivity to cAMP signaling.

40|$|Many {{excitatory}} synapses contain {{high levels}} of mobile zinc within glutamatergic vesicles. Although synaptic zinc and glutamate are coreleased, it is controversial whether zinc diffuses away from the release site or whether it remains bound to presynaptic membranes or proteins after its release. To study zinc transmission and quantify zinc levels, we required a high-affinity rapid zinc chelator {{as well as an}} extracellular ratiometric fluorescent zinc sensor. We demonstrate that tricine, considered a preferred chelator for studying the role of synaptic zinc, is unable to efficiently prevent zinc from binding low-nanomolar zinc-binding sites, such as the high-affinity zinc-binding site found in NMDA receptors (NMDARs). Here, we used ZX 1, which has a 1 nM zinc dissociation constant and second-order rate constant for binding zinc that is 200 -fold higher than those for tricine and CaEDTA. We find that synaptic zinc is phasically released during action potentials. In response to short trains of <b>presynaptic</b> <b>stimulation,</b> synaptic zinc diffuses beyond the synaptic cleft where it inhibits extrasynaptic NMDARs. During higher rates of <b>presynaptic</b> <b>stimulation,</b> released glutamate activates additional extrasynaptic NMDARs that are not reached by synaptically released zinc, but which are inhibited by ambient, tonic levels of nonsynaptic zinc. By performing a ratiometric evaluation of extracellular zinc levels in the dorsal cochlear nucleus, we determined the tonic zinc levels to be low nanomolar. These results demonstrate a physiological role for endogenous synaptic as well as tonic zinc in inhibiting extrasynaptic NMDARs and thereby fine tuning neuronal excitability and signaling.

The mobility of CPX tagged with photoactivatable green fluorescent protein (pGFP) was quantified in vivo using Caenorhabditis elegans. Although pGFP escaped the synapse within seconds, CPX-pGFP displayed both fast and slow decay components, requiring minutes for complete exchange of the synaptic pool. The longer synaptic residence time of CPX arose from both synaptic vesicle and SNARE interactions, and surprisingly, CPX mobility depended on synaptic activity. Moreover, mouse CPX-GFP reversibly dispersed out of hippocampal <b>presynaptic</b> terminals during <b>stimulation,</b> and blockade of vesicle fusion prevented CPX dispersion.

Herein we report a mechanism of noradrenergic long-term potentiation (LTP) at inhibitory synapses following <b>presynaptic</b> β-adrenoceptor activation. <b>Stimulation</b> of β-adrenoceptors elicited LTP of GABA release from terminals of cerebellar interneurones. This action was dependent on the cAMP/protein kinase A signalling cascade and independent of the β-adrenoceptor-mediated acceleration of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation (HCN) channel. Furthermore, the β-adrenoceptor- and protein kinase A-mediated LTP was triggered by enhancement of the Ca 2 + sensitivity of the release machinery and increase in the readily releasable pool. β-Adrenoceptor activation also accelerated the recruitment of GABA into the releasable pool and enhanced synchronous and asynchronous release of GABA from the presynaptic terminal. Thus, the up-regulation of GABA release machinery mediated by noradrenaline and β-adrenoceptor activation provides a likely mechanism of feedforward inhibition of the cerebellar output neurone Purkinje cell, leading to a profound effect on motor control and learning associated with the cerebellum...|$|R

Furthermore, cPAF increases synapsin I phosphorylation at sites 1 and 3, and increases dispersion of synapsin I from the <b>presynaptic</b> compartment during <b>stimulation,</b> freeing synaptic vesicles for subsequent release.

Interestingly, it is also expressed in other regions of the developing central and peripheral nervous systems, and we postulated that agrin is also a synaptogenic factor at the interneuronal synapse. To address agrin's role at the interneuronal synapse, we focused on a well-characterized peripheral interneuronal synapse in the superior cervical ganglia (SCG) and made use of transgenic mice with targeted deletions of the agrin gene: the z+ agrin-deficient and the agrin null (AGD-/-) animals. Synapses in the SCG are made onto a homogenous population of postganglionic neurons, and synaptic transmission is cholinergic, fast, excitatory and mediated by postsynaptic aggregates of neuronal AChRs (nAChRs). We found that SCG neurons in culture express a type II transmembrane and neural-specific isoform of agrin, and that agrin is highly concentrated at interneuronal sympathetic synapses. We next tested agrin's synaptogenic role at the interneuronal synapse and found that synaptic transmission was defective in z+ agrin-deficient and AGD-/- SCG. Indeed, we demonstrated that excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) in AGD-/- SCG were significantly smaller than the ones recorded in the wild type SCG. Moreover, we noted that only a fraction of the AGD-/- postganglionic neurons fired action potentials (AP) upon <b>presynaptic</b> trunk <b>stimulation.</b> Consistent with the functional defect, we demonstrated that synapses were reduced in number and poorly differentiated in both agrin-mutant lines, and addback of recombinant z+ agrin rescued the synaptic phenotype in neural agrin-deficient and AGD-/- SCG cultures.

By means of modelling design, we found that JNK, via the JBD domain, acts as a physiological effector on T-SNARE proteins; then using biochemical approaches we demonstrated the interaction between Syntaxin- 1 -JNK, Syntaxin- 2 -JNK, and Snap 25 -JNK. In addition, taking advance of the specific JNK inhibitor peptide, D-JNKI 1, we defined JNK action on the SNARE complex formation. Finally, electrophysiological recordings confirmed the role of JNK in the presynaptic modulation of vesicle release. These data suggest that JNK-dependent phosphorylation of T-SNARE proteins may have an important functional role in synaptic plasticity...|$|R
40|$|In Alzheimer's disease (AD), dysregulation of {{intracellular}} Ca 2 + signalling {{has been}} observed as an early event prior {{to the presence of}} clinical symptoms and is believed to be a crucial factor contributing to AD pathogenesis. Amyloid-β oligomers (AβOs) disturb the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) -mediated postsynaptic Ca 2 + signalling in response to <b>presynaptic</b> <b>stimulation</b> by increasing the availability of extracellular glutamate as well as directly disturbing the NMDARs. The abnormal Ca 2 + response can further lead to impairments in long-term potentiation (LTP), an important process in memory formation. In this study, we develop a mathematical model of a CA 1 pyramidal dendritic spine and conduct computational experiments. We use this model to mimic alterations by AβOs under AD conditions to investigate how they are involved in the Ca 2 + dysregulation in the dendritic spine. The alterations in glutamate availability, as well as NMDAR availability and activity, are studied both individually and globally. The simulation results suggest that alterations in glutamate availability mostly affect the synaptic response and have limited effects on the extrasynaptic receptors. Moreover, overactivation of extrasynaptic NMDARs in AD is unlikely to be induced by <b>presynaptic</b> <b>stimulation,</b> but by upregulation of the resting level of glutamate, possibly resulting from these alterations. Furthermore, internalisation of synaptic NR 2 A-NMDAR shows greater damage to the postsynaptic Ca 2 + response in comparison with the internalisation of NR 2 B-NMDARs; thus, the suggested neuroprotective role of the latter is very limited during synaptic transmission in AD. We integrate a CaMKII state transition model with the Ca 2 + model to further study the effects of alterations of NMDARs in the CaMKII state transition, an important downstream event in the early phase of LTP. The model reveals that cooperation between NR 2 A- and NR 2 B-NMDAR is required for LTP induction. Under AD conditions, internalisation of membrane NMDARs is suggested to be the cause of the loss of synapse numbers by disrupting CaMKII-NMDAR formation...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} {{fraction of}} the total calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity in neurons is associated with synaptic connections and is present in nerve terminals, thus suggesting a role for CaMKII in neurotransmitter release. To determine whether CaMKII regulates neurotransmitter release, we generated and analyzed knockout mice in which the dominant α-isoform of CaMKII was specifically deleted from the presynaptic side of the CA 3 -CA 1 hippocampal synapse. Conditional CA 3 α-CaMKII knockout mice exhibited an unchanged basal probability of neurotransmitter release at CA 3 -CA 1 synapses but showed a significant enhancement in the activity-dependent increase in probability of release during repetitive <b>presynaptic</b> <b>stimulation,</b> as was shown with the analysis of unitary synaptic currents. These data indicate that α-CaMKII serves as a negative activity-dependent regulator of neurotransmitter release at hippocampal synapses and maintains synapses in an optimal range of release probabilities necessary for normal synaptic operation...|$|E
40|$|Most {{fast-acting}} neurotransmitters {{are rapidly}} cleared from synaptic regions. This feature isolates synaptic sites, rendering the timecourse of synaptic responses {{independent of the}} number of active synapses. We describe a striking exception at glycinergic synapses on granule cells of the rat dorsal cochlear nucleus. The duration of IPSCs was dependent on the number of presynaptic axons that were stimulated and on the number of vesicles released from each axon. Increasing stimulus number or frequency, or blocking glycine uptake, slowed synaptic decays, while a low-affinity competitive antagonist of GlyRs accelerated IPSC decay. These effects could be explained by unique features of GlyRs when activated by pooling of glycine across synapses. Functionally, increasing the number of IPSPs markedly lengthened the period of spike inhibition following cessation of <b>presynaptic</b> <b>stimulation.</b> Thus, temporal properties of inhibition can be controlled by activity levels in multiple presynaptic cells or by adjusting release probability at individual synapses...|$|E
40|$|Nicotine, acting through nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} receptors (nAChR) {{located on}} nerve terminals, can evoke {{the release of}} various neurotransmitters in the brain. The <b>presynaptic</b> nicotinic <b>stimulation</b> of acetylcholine release, demonstrated in cortical and hippocampal preparations, may reflect a positive feedback mechanism via autoreceptors. This site is a target for novel nicotinic agonists in the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Nicotinic heteroreceptors can modulate the release of catecholamines and amino acid transmitters in diverse brain regions. Differences in agonist potency and efficacy and in antagonist sensitivities between different transmitter pathways suggests heterogeneity of subtypes of presynaptic nAChR (notably between alpha 3 - and alpha 4 -containing nAChR). While neurochemical studies have failed to find any evidence for the involvement of alpha 7 -type nAChR in the presynaptic modulation of transmitter release, recent electrophysiological studies have disclosed this as a possibility with respect to glutamate transmission. Investigation of the mechanisms coupling nAChR activation to exocytosis suggests that despite their high relative permeability to Ca 2 +, nAChR on striatal terminals promote dopamine release by opening voltage-sensitive Ca 2 + channels, principally N-type channels. Comparison of in vitro preparations with in vivo studies confirms that nicotine (administered via a microdialysis probe) can elicit dopamine release from the terminal fields {{of the three major}} dopamine pathways: This is dose dependent and mecamylamine sensitive. However, release from striatum and accumbens (but not frontal cortex) is completely blocked by tetrodotoxin, compared with a partial block (40 %) of release from synaptosomes. In vivo, nicotine may be able to influence dopamine release by acting on 1) ''pre-terminal'' nAChR, 2) presynaptic nAChR on adjacent glutamatergic terminals, or 3) local interneurones bearing nAChR, in addition to a direct action th rough presynaptic nAChR on dopaminergic terminals. Thus, a complex picture is emerging of various loci at which nicotine and other agonists can act through a variety of nAChR subtypes to influence neurotransmitter release: The significance of this phenomenon for synaptic transmission is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Piccolo and Bassoon are the {{two largest}} cytomatrix of the active zone (CAZ) {{proteins}} involved in scaffolding and regulating neurotransmitter release at presynaptic active zones (AZs), but have long been discussed as being functionally redundant. We employed genetic manipulation to bring forth and segregate the role of Piccolo from that of Bassoon at central auditory synapses of the cochlear nucleus—the endbulbs of Held. These synapses specialize in high frequency synaptic transmission, ideally poised to reveal even subtle deficits in the regulation of neurotransmitter release upon molecular perturbation. Combining semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and in vitro and in vivo electrophysiology we first studied signal transmission in Piccolo-deficient mice. Our analysis was not confounded by a cochlear deficit, as a short isoform of Piccolo (“Piccolino”) present at the upstream ribbon synapses of cochlear inner hair cells (IHC), is unaffected by the mutation. Disruption of Piccolo increased the abundance of Bassoon at the AZs of endbulbs, while that of RIM 1 was reduced and other CAZ proteins remained unaltered. <b>Presynaptic</b> fiber <b>stimulation</b> revealed smaller amplitude of the evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSC), while eEPSC kinetics as well as miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) remained unchanged. Cumulative analysis of eEPSC trains indicated that the reduced eEPSC amplitude of Piccolo-deficient endbulb synapses is primarily due to a reduced readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles (SV), as was corroborated by a reduction of vesicles at the AZ found on an ultrastructural level. Release probability seemed largely unaltered. Recovery from short-term depression was slowed. We then performed a physiological analysis of endbulb synapses from mice which, in addition to Piccolo deficiency, lacked one functional allele of the Bassoon gene. Analysis of the double-mutant endbulbs revealed an increase in release probability, while the synapses still exhibited the reduced RRP, and the impairment in SV replenishment was exacerbated. We propose additive roles of Piccolo and Bassoon in SV replenishment which in turn influences the organization {{and size of the}} RRP, and an additional role of Bassoon in regulation of release probability...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that tachykinins mediate slow {{synaptic}} transmission to myenteric AH (afterhyperpolarising) neurons via neurokinin- 3 receptors (NK 3 R). This study investigated a similar role for neurokinin- 1 receptors (NK 1 R) and compared the effect of selective receptor antagonists on non-cholinergic slow excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) recorded in myenteric AH neurons of the guinea-pig ileum. Slow EPSPs evoked by electrical stimulation of circumferentially oriented presynaptic nerves were mimicked by application of senktide, an NK 3 R agonist. [Sar 9,Met(O 2) 11]-substance P, an NK 1 R agonist, depolarised a smaller number of neurons. SR 142801, a selective NK 3 R antagonist (100 nM), inhibited slow EPSPs and responses to senktide, but had no effect on depolarisations evoked by forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase. SR 140333, a selective NK 1 R antagonist, inhibited slow EPSPs in a subset of neurons and blocked responses to [Sar 9,Met(O 2) 11]-substance P, but not to senktide or forskolin. Slow EPSPs that were predominantly mediated by NK 1 R had significantly shorter latencies than those due to activation of NK 3 R. After blockade of slow EPSPs, slow hyperpolarizing responses to <b>presynaptic</b> nerve <b>stimulation</b> were revealed in one-third of neurons. These events, which were associated with a decrease in input resistance and blocked by tetrodotoxin, were equated with slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. They were abolished by the 5 -hydroxytryptamine 1 A receptor antagonist 1 -(2 -methoxyphenyl) - 4 -[4 -(2 -phthalimido) butyl]- piperazine (NAN- 190), but unaffected by phentolamine, an a- adrenoceptor antagonist. In conclusion, these results provide the first direct evidence that NK 1 R mediate some slow excitatory synaptic input to myenteric AH neurons, and suggest that NK 1 R and NK 3 R activate distinct signal transduction pathways. These results also demonstrate that slow inhibitory synaptic transmission, which may be mediated by 5 -hydroxytryptamine, is more prevalent in the myenteric plexus than previously indicated.
