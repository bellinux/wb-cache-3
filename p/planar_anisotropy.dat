The critical magnetic field H_c for P_a is significantly reduced in Mn_ 1 -xNi_xTiO_ 3 (x= 0. 33). P_a and P_c have been observed with both H_c and H_a. Neutron diffraction measurements revealed similar magnetic arrangements for the two compositions where the ordered spins couple antiferromagnetically with their nearest intra- and inter-planar neighbors. In the x= 0. 33 system, the uniaxial and <b>planar</b> <b>anisotropies</b> of Mn^ 2 + and Ni^ 2 + compete and {{give rise to a}} spin reorientation transition at T_R. A magnetic field, H_c, aligns the spins along c for T_R<T<T_N.

Such linear ME response provides satisfactory explanation for the behavior of the field-induced electric polarization in both compositions.

The anisotropic yield function proposed by the authors was applied to the experimental results and its validity was examined. The main result are as follows: (1) The Bauschinger effect factor, the ratio of the compressive yield stress to the prestress in tension test, decreases at first with an increase of prestrain and tends toward a limiting value. On the other hand, the ratio of the compressive yield stress to the tensile one obtained from bending test is independent of prestrain.

40|$|Fluid-rock {{interaction}} {{was investigated in}} the inner aureole of the Late Miocene Monte Capanne pluton on Elba Island (Tuscany, central Italy) by integrating structural, petrological, fluid inclusion, and stable isotope analyses. In the north-western sector of the aureole (Procchio-Spartaia area), calc-silicates alternate with nearly pure carbonate layers at the metre scale. Close to the pluton, the prograde metamorphic sequence includes calc-silicates that transition within a few metres to overlying nearly pure calcite marbles. The calc-silicates are extensively metasomatised to form massive wollastonite-grossular-bearing exoskarn. The mineralogical assemblage found in the marbles and the unshifted carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios in calcite attest that the fluid phase was internally buffered. On the other hand, the calc-silicates constituted channels for infiltration of disequilibrium fluids of magmatic origin. Fluid infiltration was enhanced by hydrofracturing and structurally-controlled by existing <b>planar</b> <b>anisotropies</b> in calc-silicates (layering and lithological boundaries). At the metamorphic peak (600 degrees C and 1. 5 - 2 kbar), the marble-calc-silicate interface acted {{as a barrier to}} fluids exsolved from the crystallising intrusions, separating two different flow patterns in the inner aureole: a high fluid-flux region on its higher grade side (Wol-zone) and a low fluid-flux region on the lower-grade side (Cpx zone). Results of this study: (1) documented that fluid pathways in the aureole rocks {{at the top of the}} pluton were largely horizontal, controlled by the lithological layering and the pluton-host rock contact; and (2) elucidated the primary control exerted by the structural and rheological properties of the host rocks on the geometry of fluid flow during pluton emplacement...|$|R

The asymptotic and effective critical exponents and their corresponding amplitudes have been derived from the magnetization data measured with the applied field along the easy plane using the conventional methods to analyze phase transitions with and without the inclusion of the "correction-to-scaling" terms originating from the nonlinear irrelevant scaling fields. Inclusion of the correction-to-scaling terms could only influence the critical amplitude values. The values of the critical exponents obtained in this way are found to be in excellent agreement with those obtained from the magnetization data taken with the applied field parallel to the hard axis, indicating that the <b>planar</b> <b>anisotropy</b> has not influenced the critical behavior.

40|$|This study {{describes}} a peculiar, yet {{common type of}} fracture showing a staircase trajectory, which forms in rocks with moderately weak <b>planar</b> <b>anisotropies.</b> The staircase fracture trajectory is given by alternating fracture segments oriented parallel to (LaP) or at an angle (ramp) {{with respect to the}} lamination/layering. The analyses has been accomplished on travertines, which are continental microbial/hydrothermal deposits having a typical poorly stratified yet strongly laminated texture. In these rocks, porosity and permeability have a high across-lamination variability and are mostly controlled by an interconnected and locally corroded array of permeable layers, fractures, and faults. Structural analysis integrated with analytical modeling provided a conceptual model of staircase fracture localization {{as a function of the}} travertine lamination dip. Lamination-parallel fracture segments localize within the porous laminae, mostly at the interface with tight laminae. Ramp-type fracture segments cut the lamination, connecting lamination parallel segments. Two types of staircase fracture can be modeled. The first group develops in sub horizontal to gently dipping deposits (lamination dip 30 degrees) and corresponds to high-energy environments. Major discoveries of hydrocarbon have been recently made in continental (lacustrine) microbial carbonates in the Brazilian South Atlantic margin, some of which exhibit a texture similar to those usually observed in travertines. Understanding of the lacustrine carbonates is still at an early stage. Given that in modern rift settings, vent-related thermal (travertine) and nonthermal (tufa) carbonates are a major component, the proposed conceptual model of staircase fracture localization contributes to the preparation of a model for the potential occurrence of high-permeability pathways in hydrocarbon and geothermal microbial reservoirs...|$|R

Available Rb–Sr data indicates an age of 290 Ma. An emplacement model for the SEPC is proposed, taking into account magnetic fabric, 2 D gravity modelling and fluid inclusion planes studies. The G 0 and G 1 types demonstrate different magnetic behaviour: G 0 is considered a magnetite-type granite and G 1 is an ilmenite-type granite. The formation of G 0 required oxidized conditions related to the interaction of mafic rocks with a felsic magma. The 2 D gravity modelling and subvertical magnetic lineations show that the feeder zone of the SEPC is {{located in the}} eastern part of the pluton, confirming the role of the Assumar and Messejana Variscan faults in the process of ascent and emplacement. The magma emplacement was controlled by ENE–WSW <b>planar</b> <b>anisotropies</b> related to the final brittle stages of the Variscan Orogeny. The emplacement of the two granites was almost synchronous as shown by their gradational contacts in the field. The magnetic fabric however suggests emplacement of the G 0 -type first, closely followed by emplacement of the G 1 -type, pushing the G 0 laterally which becomes more anisotropic towards the margin. The G 1 -type became flattened, acquiring a dome-like structure. The SEPC is a nested pluton with G 0 -type granite assuming a tabular flat shape and G 1 -type forming a rooted dome-like structure.

For design analysis purposes in non-linear finite-element codes, this anisotropy is characterized by the use of an appropriate yield surface which is then implemented into codes such as DYNA 3 D.

Non-quadratic yield surfaces can provide more realistic strength or strain increment ratios, but they may not provide invariance and thus demand certain approximations.
