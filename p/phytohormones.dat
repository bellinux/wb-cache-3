These proteins are ubiquitinated by SCFTIR1, or SCF in complex with the auxin receptor TIR1. Degradation of Aux/IAA proteins derepresses transcription factors in the auxin-response factor (ARF) family and induces ARF-directed gene expression. The cellular consequences of ARF activation depend on the plant type and developmental stage, but are involved in directing growth in roots and leaf veins. The specific response to ARF derepression {{is thought to be}} mediated by specificity in the pairing of individual ARF and Aux/IAA proteins.|$|E

Intact 7 -day-old dark-grown ragi seedlings were given <b>phytohormone,</b> indoleacetic acid (IAA) or isopentenyladenine (i(6) A), and/or light treatments; coleoptiles were harvested 24 h following treatment, and plastid total tRNAs were isolated and compared {{with respect to}} amino acid acceptance levels and isoacceptor tRNA species distribution. We find that the overall amino acid acceptance of the plastid tRNA species is elevated following <b>phytohormone</b> and/or light treatments to dark-grown ragi seedlings. In particular, the relative acceptor activities for Leu and Tyr in i(6) A-treated dark-grown, Ile, Leu, Lys, Phe, Ser and Tyr in IAA-treated dork-grown, and Leu and Lys in i(6) A-treated light-grown ragi coleoptiles were 8 to 20 times higher.

40|$|Most organisms use daily light/dark cycles as timing cues {{to control}} many {{essential}} physiological processes. In plants, {{growth rates of}} the embryonic stem (hypocotyl) are maximal {{at different times of}} day, depending on external photoperiod and the internal circadian clock. However, the interactions between light signaling, the circadian clock, and growth-promoting hormone pathways in growth control remain poorly understood. At the molecular level, such growth rhythms could be attributed to several different layers of time-specific control such as phasing of transcription, signaling, or protein abundance. To determine the transcriptional component associated with the rhythmic control of growth, we applied temporal analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana seedling transcriptome under multiple growth conditions and mutant backgrounds using DNA microarrays. We show that a group of plant hormone-associated genes are coexpressed at the time of day when hypocotyl growth rate is maximal. This expression correlates with overrepresentation of a cis-acting element (CACATG) in <b>phytohormone</b> gene promoters, which is sufficient to confer the predicted diurnal and circadian expression patterns in vivo. Using circadian clock and light signaling mutants, we show that both internal coincidence of <b>phytohormone</b> signaling capacity and external coincidence with darkness are required to coordinate wild-type growth.

Naturally vernalized plants of cvs G 107, G 025 and G 064 were transplanted into growth chambers and subjected to various combinations of temperature [T 15 / 10, 15 °C/ 10 °C; T 20 / 15, 20 °C/ 15 °C and T 25 / 18, 25 °C/ 18 °C (day/night) ] and photoperiod (L 8, 8  h and L 14, 14  h) treatments. Plant growth, endogenous <b>phytohormone</b> and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) levels, along with the bolting and yield of garlic were evaluated. The experimental results from two consecutive years indicated that higher temperature (20 °C or 25 °C) and longer photoperiod (14  h) treatments significantly enhanced the garlic bolting, bulbing and cloving with a shorter growth period and a higher bulb weight. Moreover, the endogenous <b>phytohormone</b> and MeJA levels in the test plants were significantly increased by the higher temperature (25 °C for the <b>phytohormone</b> level; 20 °C for the MeJA level) and longer photoperiod [14  h, except for abscisic acid (ABA), which had the highest level at 8  h] conditions and were decreased by the lowest test temperature (15 °C) and shorter photoperiod (8  h, except for ABA) conditions.
