40|$|The Westphalian {{resistant}} Norway rat strain is characterised by {{the possession}} of the Y 139 C variant of the vkorc 1 gene, and practical resistance occurs in rat infestations at different frequencies to the anticoagulants warfarin, coumatetralyl, bromadiolone and difenacoum. Within the present study we investigated whether there was an obvious pattern {{in the distribution of}} resistance in relation to the distance to an identified hot spot of resistance from the site of sampling and whether the frequency of the resistance gene was connected with local conditions, such as rodent control history. Rats were trapped at a single infested site in each of 12 1 km x 1 km squares in a line including a resistance hot spot. Tissue samples were taken from all trapped rats, and genotyped for the Y 139 C variant of the vkorc 1 gene. The frequency of the resistance gene was determined for each site sampled. Data were also collected about rodent control measures applied in the past and other relevant local conditions. The frequency of the resistance gene varied considerably between 80 %. There was no obvious correlation of the frequency of the resistance gene and the distance to the hot spot, and there was no increase or decrease of the gene frequency in west-east direction. <b>Permanent</b> <b>baiting</b> and poor rodent control practice seemed to increase the incidence of resistance in the respective site. The implementation of good rodent control practice is recommended to prevent an increase in the frequency of resistance. The study was funded by the Rodenticide Resistance Action Committee (RRAC) of CropLife International...|$|E
40|$|Summary Hunting for {{brown bear}} (Ursus arctos) {{has a long}} {{tradition}} in Scandinavia, from the times when the populations of bears were far above the level that we have today, and for a century when the policy was to eradicate all predators in Scandinavia. However with successful management, the brown bear population grew from about 130 individuals to about 3, 300 today. Quota hunting in Sweden began in 1943. Hunting with bait was an important hunting method before it was banned in 2001. Now interest groups want this method to be allowed again Sweden. Authorities want a better scientific basis for deciding the question of initiation of hunting with bait. The need for a scientific study that deals with hunting with bait and how bears use of bait site is great since there is little scientific knowledge on this topic. To find out how bears use bait sites, I have used a remote camera to record the use of various bait sites types and in two areas of Sweden. Two of the main questions were whether the bears actually use the bait and time of day they visit bait site. Sweden has set a limit on when hunting starts and ends each day; one hour after sunrise and two hours before sunset respectively. The results of this study show that bears visiting bait sites, mostly in the morning before sunrise and after sunset in the evening. I have also examined whether there is any difference between the numbers of visits on bait sites that are permanent, i. e. actively baiting from the bears emerge from the den in the spring until denning in October or November, and temporary bait sites started {{a few weeks before the}} bear hunting period. The results show that <b>permanent</b> <b>bait</b> sites had the most visits throughout the season, whereas temporary bait sites had more visits in the hunting season, compared with <b>permanent</b> <b>bait</b> sites in the same period. Generally, hunting with bait could help to decrease the number of wounded bears and the necessity to search for wounded bears. Hunting with bait may also contribute to determining the age-and sex of harvested bears in those cases where the hunter has a better ability to determine age and sex, compared with a dog hunting. The conclusion of this study is that hunting with bait will not result in more harvested bears, because few bears visit the bait in the time window for legal hunting during the day, especially with the short daylight during the legal hunting season for bears...|$|R
40|$|Commensal rodents {{have become}} {{increasingly}} troublesome and damaging pests in insulated structures. Modern poultry and livestock confinement buildings in the Midwest often have insulated walls and ceilings. These buildings usually provide an optimum habitat for rats and mice; the rodents gnaw, tunnel through, and nest in the insulation, decreasing its insulative value. Such structures {{are known to be}} heavily damaged within a matter of months when commensal rodents have access to wall spaces and attics. We have developed an economic threshold model to help livestock producers or building managers decide when to conduct house mouse (Mus musculus) control in such situations. The model is based upon the cost of house mouse damage to commonly used types of insulation in walls, as measured in laboratory experiments. Components of the damage are 1) the cost of insulation replacement and 2) increased heating costs due to damaged insulation. Damage costs are compared to the expense of conducting mouse control using anticoagulant rodenticides in <b>permanent</b> <b>bait</b> stations located throughout the structure. The model concludes that it is cost-effective to implement a baiting program for mouse control in nearly all insulated confinement buildings. The cost of control is usually very small when compared to the cost of potential mouse damage...|$|R
40|$|The brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) {{has been}} {{identified}} as a significant New Zealand conservation pest and a major wildlife reservoir of bovine tuberculosis (Tb; Mycobacterium bovis). To combat its continuing impact, central and local government agencies currently spend more than $ 50 million per annum on possum management activities. The current objective of this effort is to maintain possum population densities in selected areas below predetermined environmental and disease thresholds. Six toxicants are currently registered for possum control, with sodium monofiuoroacetate (1080) being the most extensively used. 1080 can be incorporated into various baits types and {{has been shown to be}} an extremely cost-effective method of initially removing 100 ha) areas are controlled and 90 % of the susceptible (i. e., non bait-shy) possums are killed in each operation. The 60 % sustained population reduction can be achieved solely using 1080 control, however, the 80 % population reduction will require the occasional use of an alternative, slower acting toxicant such as brodifacoum. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the most important variable influencing the overall success of these control strategies was the maximum rate of migration following control, which is influenced by control area size. With the high rates of migration that are sometimes observed into small (< 100 ha) forest reserves, expensive <b>permanent</b> <b>bait</b> stations, containing brodifacoum bait, may be required in these to minimise the effects of immigration. The results of this study suggest that most 1080 cereal bait-shy possums will consume a lethal dose of a chronic brodifacoum toxicant provided their exposure to it is prolonged. However, subacute cholecalciferol poisoning symptoms do not appear to be delayed for long enough to be effective in the field when used in a familiar bait matrix. The effectiveness of 1080 and the alternative, slower-acting toxicants is enhanced when presented in the unfamiliar bait matrixes and these bait types should be field trialed in maintenance control operations. The low number of pre-fed possums (22 %) that become 1080 bait shy following multiple doses of 1080 bait suggests that field managers should consider making greater use of non-toxic prefeed prior to bait station control operations. In conclusion, the modelling simulations suggest that sustained population reductions of 60 - 80 % can be achieved using current control techniques. Further studies are required to determine the effectiveness of these strategies in the field. Possum researchers also need to investigate the factors determining population recovery in different sized control areas. The actual timing of control may vary between different control sites, and can only be established by direct measures of animal recovery and abundance...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} visitation {{frequency}} {{and rate of}} wolverines (Gulo gulo) at experimental bait sites originally designed for brown bears (Ursus arctos) in Dalarna, Gävleborg, and Västerbotten counties, Sweden, 2008 - 2012. Bait sites were either permanent, i. e., fixed location {{that could not be}} changed throughout the study period, or temporary, i. e., location that could be changed between study years. Bait sites were restocked weekly with bait, i. e., meat (ungulates or fish) and vegetable materials (i. e., corn and beet root). Two remote cameras were installed at each bait site to capture images of visiting animals. The goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate the visitation frequency of wolverines at bait sites, their duration of time spent at bait sites, and the time interval between consecutive visits. Further, I also evaluated different behavioral pattern displayed by wolverines during their visits at the bait sites. Wolverines were the third most common mammal species observed at bait sites, and the second most common mammal observed at the bait sites when considering only the North study area (Västerbotten). Overall, wolverines carried out 74 visits during the study period, and significantly more (~ 93 %) were observed in the North. The average visitation rate for the study period was 3. 7 visits per week and did vary significantly between weeks. Visitation frequency did not differ between <b>permanent</b> and temporary <b>bait</b> sites or season (spring/summer and autumn). The highest visitation frequency was observed in 2010. Wolverines are considered a nocturnal species, and I observed significantly more visits during the night hours (68. 9 %) in comparison to day hours. After the initial establishment of a bait site, it took wolverines an average of 42 days to visit this bait site for the first time. In a Norwegian study, it took wolverines an average of 72 days until the first visit of bait sites at hunting hides. The average time wolverines spent at a bait site was 6. 3 minutes, and the majority (77. 1 %) of visits lasted shorter than 10 minutes. The average time between two consecutive visits at a bait site was 79 hours (~ 3 days) in a given year. The wolverine is listed as vulnerable (VU) in the red list of endangered species in Sweden, and is protected by several national and international regulations and directives. To manage this elusive carnivore can be demanding, and implementing an adaptive management strategy requires good knowledge of its distribution and population size. The study design applied in this study, with some adaptations, could be useful for population monitoring purposes. The most important adaptation would have to be to restock bait sites also during the winter season. In the course of this study, bait sites were removed when bear denning started in autumn and reestablished in spring after the end of the bear denning period. Population monitoring of 2 wolverines based on bait sites could provide insight into demographic patterns, conspecific and intra-guild competition, dispersal patterns, and individual wolverines could potentially be identified based on fur coloration and markings...|$|R
