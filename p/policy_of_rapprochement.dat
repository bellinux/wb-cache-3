5|$|In June 1399, Louis, Duke of Orléans, {{gained control}} of the court of the insane Charles VI of France. The <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>rapprochement</b> with the English crown did not suit Louis's {{political}} ambitions, {{and for this reason}} he found it opportune to allow Henry to leave for England. With a small group of followers, Bolingbroke landed at Ravenspur in Yorkshire towards the end of June 1399. Men {{from all over the country}} soon rallied around the duke. Meeting with Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, who had his own misgivings about the king, Bolingbroke insisted that his only object was to regain his own patrimony. Percy took him at his word and declined to interfere. The king had taken most of his household knights and the loyal members of his nobility with him to Ireland, so Henry experienced little resistance as he moved south. Edmund of Langley, Duke of York, who was acting as Keeper of the Realm, had little choice but to side with Bolingbroke. Meanwhile, Richard was delayed in his return from Ireland and did not land in Wales until 24 July. He made his way to Conwy, where on 12 August he met with the Earl of Northumberland for negotiations. On 19 August, Richard II surrendered to Henry at Flint Castle, promising to abdicate if his life were spared. Both men then returned to London, the indignant king riding all the way behind Henry. On arrival, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London on 1 September.|$|E

The group included the Tao Fong Shan Ecumenical Centre, Hong Kong Christian Council, Lutheran World Federation, China Study Project (Anglican), and Pro Mundi Vita (Roman Catholic), among others. Participants included Philip Wickeri, Edmond Tang, Arne Sovik, and Bob Whyte. The {{members of this group}} published several periodicals, including Bridge, Religion in the People’s Republic of China, and Ching Feng, which reprinted TSPM documents and statements and generally followed an editorial policy sympathetic to the TSPM’s viewpoint.|$|E
25|$|The {{reign of}} Muzaffar Shah's son, Sultan Mansur Shah (r.1459–1477) {{witnessed}} the major {{expansion of the}} sultanate to reach its greatest extent of influence. Among the earliest territory ceded to the sultanate was Pahang, with its capital, Inderapura – a massive unexplored land with a large river and abundant source of gold which was ruled by Maharaja Dewa Sura, a relative of the King of Ligor. The Sultan dispatched a fleet of two hundred ships, led by Tun Perak and 19 Malaccan hulubalangs' ('commanders'). On reaching Pahang, a battle broke out in which the Pahangites were decisively defeated and its entire royal court were captured. The Malaccan fleet returned home with Dewa Sura and his daughter, Wanang Seri who were handed over to Sultan Mansur Shah. The Sultan appointed Tun Hamzah to rule Pahang. A <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>rapprochement</b> with Ligor was later initiated by Mansur Shah to ensure steady supplies of rice.|$|E

Then Dimitrov, {{initiated}} {{the idea of}} a Balkan Federation that would range from Pirin to the Shar Mountains and reflect a Macedonian consciousness. For this purpose, he launched a <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> forced Macedonisation of the Bulgarian population in the Pirin region through conscious change of ethnic self-determination, held by means of administrative coercion and intensive propaganda.|$|R
25|$|Apart {{from the}} Oil Rocks, Azerbaijan's first {{offshore}} oil field was {{opened in the}} early 1950s. <b>Policies</b> <b>of</b> de-Stalinization and improvement after the 1950s led to better education and welfare conditions for most of Azerbaijan. This also coincided with the period of rapid urbanization and industrialization. During this period of change, a new anti-Islamic drive and return to a <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> Russification, under the <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> sblizheniye (<b>rapprochement),</b> was instituted in order to merge all {{the peoples of the}} USSR into a new monolithic Soviet nation.|$|R
50|$|In 1967 the North Atlantic Council {{formally}} {{adopted a}} proposal, formulated by Belgian foreign minister Pierre Harmel, that altered the nature <b>of</b> NATO <b>policy.</b> The Harmel {{plan called for}} NATO to be partially transformed from an entirely defensive system to one designed to encourage East-West détente and increased political consultation {{among the members of}} the alliance. By the late 1970s, however, the optimistic <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> East- West <b>rapprochement</b> had deteriorated. Arms control negotiations were not achieving results, and the NATO countries became increasingly concerned about the Soviet military buildup.|$|R
25|$|On {{the death}} of Henry in 1112, his widow Theresa succeeded him {{as head of the}} two Counties of Portugal and Coimbra, during the {{minority}} of her son, Afonso Henriques. Two trends emerged at this time, firstly a <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>rapprochement</b> with the new King Alfonso VII, and secondly the maintenance of their power with the aim that the heir to the county would be proclaimed king. The increasing importance of Santiago de Compostela—now metropolitan church of Lusitania, which was in open competition with Braga, metropolitan church of Galicia—and the support for Theresa's rule north of the Minho brought about by her romantic union with Fernando Pérez de Traba altered the status quo. The Archbishop of Braga, who had suffered the nocturnal theft of the relics of Fructuosus of Braga by Diego Gelmirez in 1102, and the major Portuguese aristocrats who were pursuing a larger territorial authority, gave support to the royal pretensions of Afonso Henriques. Given this situation, King Alfonso VII marched on Portugal, taking first Tui and other territories north of the river Minho, later besieging Guimarães and obtaining the submission of the Portuguese.|$|E
25|$|In the 1969 election, the SPD—headed by Willy Brandt—gained {{enough votes}} to form a {{coalition}} government with the FDP. Although Chancellor for only just over four years, Brandt {{was one of the}} most popular politicians in the whole period. Brandt was a gifted speaker and the growth of the Social Democrats from there on was in no small part due to his personality. Brandt began a <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>rapprochement</b> with West Germany's eastern neighbors known as Ostpolitik, a policy opposed by the CDU. The issue of improving relations with Poland, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany made for an increasingly aggressive tone in public debates but it was a huge step forward when Willy Brandt and the Foreign Minister, Walther Scheel (FDP) negotiated agreements with all three countries (Moscow Agreement, August 1970, Warsaw Agreement, December 1970, Four-Power Agreement over the status of West Berlin in 1971 and an agreement on relations between West and East Germany, signed in December 1972). These agreements were the basis for a rapid improvement in the relations between east and west and led, in the long term, to the dismantlement of the Warsaw Treaty and the Soviet Union's control over East-Central Europe. During a visit to Warsaw on 7 December 1970, Brandt made the Warschauer Kniefall by kneeling before a monument to those killed in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, a gesture of humility and penance that no German Chancellor had made until that time. Chancellor Brandt was forced to resign in May 1974, after Günter Guillaume, a senior member of his staff, was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service, the Stasi. Brandt's contributions to world peace led to his winning the Nobel Peace Prize for 1971.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 August 1939, Hitler {{received}} {{a message from}} Stalin reading, [...] "The Soviet Government has instructed me to say they agree to Herr von Ribbentrop's arrival on 23 August". That same day, Hitler ordered German mobilization. The extent that Hitler was influenced by Ribbentrop's advice {{can be seen in}} Hitler's orders for a limited mobilization against Poland alone. Weizsäcker recorded in his diary throughout {{the spring and summer of}} 1939 repeated statements from Hitler that any German–Polish war would be only a localized conflict and that there was no danger of a general war as long as the Soviet Union could be persuaded to stay neutral. Hitler believed that British policy was based upon securing Soviet support for Poland, which led him to perform a diplomatic U-turn and support Ribbentrop's <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>rapprochement</b> with the Soviet Union as the best way of ensuring a local war. This was especially the case as decrypts showed the British military attaché to Poland arguing that Britain could not save Poland in the event of a German attack, and only Soviet support offered the prospect of Poland holding out.|$|E
5000|$|In his {{retirement}} Haugwitz was still consulted, {{and he used}} all his influence against Hardenberg's <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> a <b>rapprochement</b> with France. His representations had little weight, however, until Napoleon's violation Prussian territory by marching troops through the Principality of Ansbach roused the anger of the king. Haugwitz was now once more appointed foreign minister, as Hardenberg's colleague, and {{it was he who}} was charged to carry to Napoleon the Prussian ultimatum which was the outcome of the visit of the Tsar Alexander I to Berlin in November. But in this crisis his courage failed him; his nature was one that ever let [...] "I dare not" [...] wait upon [...] "I will"; he delayed his journey pending some turn in events and to give time for the mobilization of the Duke of Brunswick's army; he was frightened by reports of separate negotiations between Austria and Napoleon, not realizing that a bold declaration by Prussia would nip them in the bud. Napoleon, when at last they met, read him like a book and humoured his diplomatic weakness until the whole issue was decided at Austerlitz. On 15 December 1805 instead of delivering an ultimatum, Haugwitz signed a treaty of alliance at Schönbrunn which gave Hanover to Prussia in return for Ansbach, Cleves and Neuenburg.|$|R
40|$|I {{will first}} discuss the {{politics}} <b>of</b> <b>rapprochement</b> <b>of</b> the Kirchner administration. While the Movimiento del Dolor demands justice {{and an end}} to police abuse and impunity, the government’s response is typically to receive family members in the Casa Rosada, the Ministry of Justice, or the Secretariat of Human Rights, and to offer them jobs and subsidies. The key issue here concerns the implication of the politics <b>of</b> <b>rapprochement</b> for the Movimiento del Dolor and the relative/victim-state interaction. Following that, I will present the National Program against Impunity (PNAI), in which state victims participate, and {{which is one of the}} most visible expressions of the politics <b>of</b> <b>rapprochement</b> <b>of</b> the Kirchner government...|$|R

2500|$|... "On 20 August 1939, Hitler sent a {{personal}} message to Stalin, {{asking him to}} receive Ribbentrop no later than the twenty-third. Ribbentrop made for Moscow, where, as both Orwell and Koestler noted, swastikas adorned the airport of {{the capital of the}} homeland of socialism. This, the final ideological shock that separated Koestler from communism, was really a sign that the Soviet Union was no longer an ideological state. The two regimes immediately found common ground in their mutual aspiration to destroy Poland ...the Soviet Union had agreed to attack Poland along with Germany. ... In August and September 1939, Stalin was reading maps not just of east Europe but of east Asia. He had found an opportunity to improve the Soviet position in the Far East. ...Stalin could now be confident that no German-Polish attack was coming from the west... The Soviets (and their Mongolian allies) attacked Japanese (and puppet Manchukuo) forces... on 20 August 1939. Stalin's <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>rapprochement</b> with Berlin of August 23, 1939 was also directed against Tokyo. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union, signed three days after the offensive, nullified the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany and Japan. Even more than the battlefield defeat, the Nazi-Soviet alliance brought a political earthquake to Tokyo. The Japanese government fell, as would several more in the coming months. Once Germany seemed to have chosen the Soviet Union rather than Japan as its ally, the Japanese government found itself in an unexpected and confusing situation... if the union between Moscow and Berlin held, the Red Army would be able to concentrate its forces in Asia rather than in Europe. ... Hitler had given Stalin a free hand in Asia, and the Japanese could only hope that Hitler would betray his new friend. ... When the Red Army defeated the Japanese, on 15 September, Stalin had achieved exactly the result that he wanted. ... Stalin had replaced the phantom of a German-Polish-Japanese encirclement of the Soviet Union with a very real German-Soviet encirclement of Poland, an alliance that isolated Japan." ...|$|E
