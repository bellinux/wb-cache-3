5|$|Prior to the battle, the Hellenes {{remembered the}} Dorians, an ethnic {{distinction}} which {{applied to the}} Spartans, as the conquerors and displacers of the Ionians in the Peloponnesus. After the battle, Spartan culture became an inspiration and object of emulation, a <b>phenomenon</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> Laconophilia.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{negative}} health consequences of obesity {{in the general}} population are well supported by the available evidence, health outcomes in certain subgroups seem to be improved at an increased BMI, a <b>phenomenon</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the obesity survival paradox. The paradox was first described in 1999 in overweight and obese people undergoing hemodialysis, and has subsequently been found in those with heart failure and peripheral artery disease (PAD).|$|E
5|$|LDLR {{mutations}} {{are more}} common in certain populations, presumably because of a genetic <b>phenomenon</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the founder effect—they were founded by {{a small group of}} individuals, one or several of whom was a carrier of the mutation. The Afrikaner, French Canadians, Lebanese Christians, and Finns have high rates of specific mutations that make FH particularly common in these groups. APOB mutations {{are more common}} in Central Europe.|$|E

5|$|More broadly, the Restoration Movement was an evangelistic and Bible-based effort {{launched}} in various places as several people sought {{a return to}} the original teachings and practices of the New Testament. Christian leaders including Robert Sandeman, Abner Jones, Elias Smith, James O'Kelly, Rice Haggard, Thomas Campbell, Alexander Campbell, Walter Scott, and Barton W. Stone were trailblazers of similar movements that impacted the eventual <b>phenomenon</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the American Restoration Movement.|$|E
5|$|Surface level {{humidity}} is {{less than}} 0.1%. Venus's sulfuric acid rain never reaches the ground, but is evaporated by the heat before reaching the surface in a <b>phenomenon</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> virga. It is theorized that early volcanic activity released sulfur into the atmosphere and the high temperatures prevented it from being trapped into solid compounds on the surface as {{it was on the}} Earth.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{cause of}} Tourette's is unknown, {{but it is}} well {{established}} that both genetic and environmental factors are involved. Genetic epidemiology {{studies have shown that}} the overwhelming majority of cases of Tourette's are inherited, although the exact mode of inheritance is not yet known and no gene has been identified. In other cases, tics are associated with disorders other than Tourette's, a <b>phenomenon</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> tourettism.|$|E

5|$|Upper-level jet streams. Associated with {{upper level}} jet streams is a <b>phenomenon</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> clear air {{turbulence}} (CAT), caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear connected to the wind gradient {{at the edge of}} the jet streams. The CAT is strongest on the anticyclonic shear side of the jet, usually next to or just below the axis of the jet.|$|E
5|$|A weather <b>phenomenon</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the föhn (with an {{identical}} effect to the chinook wind) can occur {{at all times}} of the year and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind, bringing air of very low relative humidity {{to the north of the}} Alps during rainfall periods on the southern face of the Alps. This works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming wind from the south. Valleys running south to north trigger the best effect.|$|E
5|$|An optical <b>phenomenon,</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> a green flash, can {{sometimes}} be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is scattered more, leaving light that is perceived as green.|$|E

5|$|Associated with jet streams is a <b>phenomenon</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> clear-air {{turbulence}} (CAT), {{caused by}} {{vertical and horizontal}} wind shear caused by jet streams. The CAT is strongest on the cold air side of the jet, next to and just under the axis of the jet. Clear-air turbulence can cause aircraft to plunge and so present a passenger safety hazard that has caused fatal accidents, such as {{the death of one}} passenger on United Airlines Flight 826.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus humilis clouds usually {{indicate}} fair weather. Cumulus mediocris {{clouds are}} similar, {{except that they}} have some vertical development, which implies that they can grow into cumulus congestus or even cumulonimbus clouds, which can produce heavy rain, lightning, severe winds, hail, and even tornadoes. Cumulus congestus clouds, which appear as towers, will often grow into cumulonimbus storm clouds. They can produce precipitation. Glider pilots often {{pay close attention to}} cumulus clouds, as they can be indicators of rising air drafts or thermals underneath that can suck the plane high into the skya <b>phenomenon</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> cloud suck.|$|E
5|$|Established {{traits are}} not immutable; traits that have high fitness in one {{environmental}} context {{may be much}} less fit if environmental conditions change. In the absence of natural selection to preserve such a trait, it becomes more variable and deteriorate over time, possibly resulting in a vestigial manifestation of the trait, also called evolutionary baggage. In many circumstances, the apparently vestigial structure may retain a limited functionality, or may be co-opted for other advantageous traits in a <b>phenomenon</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> preadaptation. A famous example of a vestigial structure, {{the eye of the}} blind mole-rat, is believed to retain function in photoperiod perception.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, Osborn helped secure Beebe a new {{research}} station in Guiana to replace Kalacoon: Beebe was offered Kartabo Point, an outpost of a New York-based mining corporation. Beebe was {{enthusiastic about the}} new station, and it proved very successful for conducting the same detailed analyses of wildlife within small areas that had been performed at Kalacoon. At Kartabo Beebe discovered the <b>phenomenon</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> an ant mill, a column of ants following itself in an endless loop until {{nearly all of them}} died of exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|Initially, many {{physicists}} {{hoped that}} by compactifying eleven-dimensional supergravity, {{it might be}} possible to construct realistic models of our four-dimensional world. The hope was that such models would provide a unified description of the four fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and gravity. Interest in eleven-dimensional supergravity soon waned as various flaws in this scheme were discovered. One of the problems was that the laws of physics appear to distinguish between clockwise and counterclockwise, a <b>phenomenon</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> chirality. Edward Witten and others observed this chirality property cannot be readily derived by compactifying from eleven dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species of}} malacostracans have {{distinct}} sexes (a <b>phenomenon</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> gonochorism), {{although a few}} species exhibit hermaphroditism. The female genital openings or gonopores are located on the sixth thoracic segment or its appendages, while the male gonopores are on the eighth segment or its appendages, or in {{a small number of}} species, on the seventh. The naupliar larval stages are often reduced and take place before hatching, but where they occur, a metamorphosis usually occurs between the larval and the adult forms. Primitive malacostracans have a free-swimming naupliar larval stage.|$|E
