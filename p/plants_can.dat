5|$|Geothermal power <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> operate 24hours per day, {{providing}} baseload capacity. Estimates for {{the world}} potential capacity for geothermal power generation vary widely, ranging from 40 GW by 2020 {{to as much as}} 6,000 GW.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{thermal power}} <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> {{generally}} {{be built in}} a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular, readily available materials. In contrast, many types of conventional power projects, especially coal and nuclear plants, require long lead times.|$|E
5|$|Telopea oreades needs a well-drained {{location}} as well {{as reliable}} moisture to thrive. Soil with some clay content is beneficial. It is more shade-tolerant than the more popular New South Wales waratah, preferring part-shade but tolerating sunny aspects. It tolerates moderate frosts. <b>Plants</b> <b>can</b> be hard-pruned—lopping old stems and branches can rejuvenate mature plants. <b>Plants</b> <b>can</b> benefit from low-phosphorus fertilizer applied in spring and autumn. Propagation is by seed, the germination rates of which fall significantly after several months' storage unless refrigerated, or by cuttings of new growth that has just hardened. Cultivars must be propagated by cutting to make daughter plants identical to the parent.|$|E
50|$|The <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> {{be grown}} as an {{ornamental}} plant in rock gardens Mediterranean regions. In the Benelux, the <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> be grown indoors as a pot <b>plant.</b> The <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> be propagated by seeding.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, {{the plant}} has been {{cultivated}} since 2000. The <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> {{be kept in}} a temperate greenhouses or in a living room. In summer the <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> be grown outside.|$|R
25|$|Microbial {{fuel cells}} finally allow the {{generation}} of electricity from biomass. The <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> be chopped and converted as a whole, {{or it can be}} left alive so that waste saps from the <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> be converted by bacteria.|$|R
5|$|Herbivores eat plants, but <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> defend {{themselves}} and some species are parasitic or even carnivorous. Other organisms form mutually beneficial relationships with plants. For example, mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia provide plants with nutrients {{in exchange for}} food, ants are recruited by ant plants to provide protection, honey bees, bats and other animals pollinate flowers and humans and other animals act as dispersal vectors to spread spores and seeds.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms and <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> {{synthesize}} many uncommon amino acids. For example, some microbes make 2-aminoisobutyric {{acid and}} lanthionine, {{which is a}} sulfide-bridged derivative of alanine. Both of these amino acids are found in peptidic lantibiotics such as alamethicin. However, in plants, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid is a small disubstituted cyclic amino acid that is a key intermediate {{in the production of}} the plant hormone ethylene.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{defense against}} {{herbivory}} or host-plant resistance (HPR) describes {{a range of}} adaptations evolved by plants which improve their survival and reproduction by reducing the impact of herbivores. <b>Plants</b> <b>can</b> sense being touched, and they can use several strategies to defend against damage caused by herbivores. Many plants produce secondary metabolites, known as allelochemicals, that influence the behavior, growth, or survival of herbivores. These chemical defenses can act as repellents or toxins to herbivores, or reduce plant digestibility.|$|E

5|$|<b>Plants</b> <b>can</b> {{synthesise}} useful coloured {{dyes and pigments}} such as the anthocyanins {{responsible for}} the red colour of red wine, yellow weld and blue woad used together to produce Lincoln green, indoxyl, source of the blue dye indigo traditionally used to dye denim and the artist's pigments gamboge and rose madder.|$|E
5|$|The genome size, and {{the number}} of genes it encodes varies widely between organisms. The {{smallest}} genomes occur in viruses (which can have as few as 2 protein-coding genes), and viroids (which act as a single non-coding RNA gene). Conversely, <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> have extremely large genomes, with rice containing >46,000 protein-coding genes. The total number of protein-coding genes (the Earth's proteome) is estimated to be 5million sequences.|$|E
5|$|The park hosts a {{wide range}} of upland and wetland vegetation. Algae and {{intertidal}} <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> be found at the shore including salt meadow grass, sedge, and sphagnum moss; the park's swampy areas have red maple and tulip trees; the upland sections include cherry, hickory, and shrubs.|$|E

5|$|The {{water in}} the bog is low in {{nutrients}} and high in acidity, which {{makes it difficult for}} most plants to live there. Only specialized <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> thrive in the park bogs: there are three species of carnivorous plants and seventeen varieties of orchid. Wild cranberries and blueberries grow in the bog along with sedges, leatherleaf shrubs, Arctic cotton grass, and viburnums. The bogs are all protected by the state of Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{habitats}} include rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, {{marshes and}} bogs. Although some organisms are found across {{most of these}} habitats, the majority have more specific requirements. The water velocity, its temperature and oxygen saturation are important factors, but in river systems, there are fast and slow sections, pools, bayous and backwaters which provide a range of habitats. Similarly, aquatic <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> be floating, semi-submerged, submerged or grow in permanently or temporarily saturated soils besides bodies of water. Marginal plants provide important habitat for both invertebrates and vertebrates, and submerged plants provide oxygenation of the water, absorb nutrients and {{play a part in}} the reduction of pollution.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{diversity}} of crops {{can be used}} to help protect the environment. Crop varieties that are resistant to pests and diseases can reduce the need for application of harmfulpesticides.While crops that are more vigorous can better compete withweeds whichreduces the need for applyingherbicides. This is shown in a case study completed atAarhus Universityin Denmark which used more robust maize.Drought resistant <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> help save water and reduce the need forirrigation whiledeeper rooting varieties can help stabilize soils; and varieties that are more efficient in their use of nutrients require lessfertilizer.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, {{researchers}} at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston found that <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> be a vector for prions. When researchers fed hamsters grass that grew on ground where a deer that died with {{chronic wasting disease}} (CWD) was buried, the hamsters became ill with CWD, suggesting that prions can bind to plants, which then take them up into the leaf and stem structure, {{where they can be}} eaten by herbivores, thus completing the cycle. It is thus possible that there is a progressively accumulating number of prions in the environment.|$|E
5|$|In addition, land {{availability}} {{has a large}} {{effect on}} the available solar energy because solar panels can only be set up on land that is otherwise unused and suitable for solar panels. Roofs {{have been found to}} be a suitable place for solar cells, as many people have discovered that they can collect energy directly from their homes this way. Other areas that are suitable for solar cells are lands that are not being used for businesses where solar <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> be established.|$|E
5|$|Lambertia formosa regenerates after bushfire by resprouting {{from its}} woody lignotuber, {{but is also}} {{serotinous}} in {{that it has a}} seed bank held in its canopy to be released after fire. The number of flowers produced by plants growing back from fire peaks two or three years afterwards. A field study in Brisbane Water National Park north of Sydney found that plants that had experienced two short (less than seven-year) intervals between bushfires had reduced reproductive output as measured by lower numbers of follicles, compared with plants in areas which had had no or one short inter-fire interval. <b>Plants</b> <b>can</b> live for over 60 years.|$|E

5|$|Most {{microorganisms}} and <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> biosynthesize all 20 standard amino acids, while animals (including humans) must obtain some of {{the amino}} acids from the diet. The amino acids that an organism cannot synthesize on its own {{are referred to as}} essential amino acids. Key enzymes that synthesize certain amino acids are not present in animals — such as aspartokinase, which catalyses {{the first step in the}} synthesis of lysine, methionine, and threonine from aspartate. If amino acids are present in the environment, microorganisms can conserve energy by taking up the amino acids from their surroundings and downregulating their biosynthetic pathways.|$|E
5|$|Organisms differ {{according}} {{to the number of}} constructed molecules in their cells. Autotrophs such as <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> construct the complex organic molecules in cells such as polysaccharides and proteins from simple molecules like carbon dioxide and water. Heterotrophs, on the other hand, require a source of more complex substances, such as monosaccharides and amino acids, to produce these complex molecules. Organisms can be further classified by ultimate source of their energy: photoautotrophs and photoheterotrophs obtain energy from light, whereas chemoautotrophs and chemoheterotrophs obtain energy from inorganic oxidation reactions.|$|E
5|$|Organisms vary {{in their}} ability to {{synthesize}} the 20 common amino acids. Most bacteria and <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> synthesize all twenty, but mammals can only synthesize eleven nonessential amino acids, so nine essential amino acids must be obtained from food. Some simple parasites, such as the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae, lack all amino acid synthesis and take their amino acids directly from their hosts. All amino acids are synthesized from intermediates in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, or the pentose phosphate pathway. Nitrogen is provided by glutamate and glutamine. Amino acid synthesis depends on the formation of the appropriate alpha-keto acid, which is then transaminated to form an amino acid.|$|E
50|$|In flat mesas the <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> {{be hidden}} under clumps and not seen. On a roadside, its {{skeleton}} {{will be left}} as a single erect plant, the taller plants being found in the highest water-pooled areas. In the eastern Colorado Desert the <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> be found in any major wash in mid spring following at least moderate winter rains.|$|R
