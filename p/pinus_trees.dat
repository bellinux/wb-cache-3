40|$|Abstract- Water {{retention}} and water turnover were investigated {{in the forest}} floor of a temperate mixed Fagus-Quercus forest on poor soil in NW Germany. By field and laboratory measurements {{the aim was to}} quantify the water extraction by those tree fine roots that concentrate in the super-ficial organic layers.

The water retention capacity (i. e. the difference between saturating water con-tent after wetting and water content prior to wetting) and the resulting percolation rate out of the forest floor were measured by infiltration experiments in relation to their dependence on the initial water content of the humus material. The water retention characteristics of the humus material differed from the sandy mineral soil material by i) a much higher maximum water con-tent (porosity), ii) a higher storage capacity for water in the plant-available water potential range, and iii) a marked temporal variability of the water retention capacity.

Insecticidal knock-down {{was used to}} comprehensively sample spiders from 175 trees from 2001 to 2003 in the Białowiez_a forest and three remote forests in Poland. We identified 140 species from 9273 adult spiders. Spider communities were distinguished between deciduous and coniferous trees. The richest fauna was collected from Quercus where beta diversity was also highest. A tree-species-specific pattern was clearly observed for Alnus, Carpinus, Picea and <b>Pinus</b> <b>trees</b> and also for those tree species that were fogged in only four or three replicates, namely Betula and Populus. This hitherto unrecognised association was mainly due to the community composition of common species identified in a Dufrene-Legendre indicator species analysis. It was not caused by spatial or temporal autocorrelation. Explaining tree-species specificity for generalist predators like spiders is difficult and has to involve physical and ecological tree parameters like linkage with the abundance of prey species. However, neither did we find a consistent correlation of prey group abundances with spiders nor could differences in spider guild composition explain the observed pattern. Our results hint towards the importance of deterministic mechanisms structuring communities of generalist canopy spiders although the casual relationship is not yet understood...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of woody vegetation and biological soil crusts on infiltration capacity {{is one of}} the several uncertainties associated with the ecohydrologic effects of woody plant encroachment into arid and semi-arid land systems. The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the effects of Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) and pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) on subcanopy and intercanopy ecohydrologic properties. We measured soil sorptivity, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity [K(h) ], soil water content (SWC), and water repellency along radial line transects from under Juniperus and <b>Pinus</b> <b>trees</b> into the centre of the intercanopy space between trees. In the subcanopy, litter mounds, hydrophobic soils, and roots all appear to contribute to preferential flow to below-surface soils via wetted patches. For both Juniperus and Pinus, K(h) was significantly lower in the subcanopy than the intercanopy average; however, line transect measurements did not show distinct boundaries in K(h) between the two regions. K(h) increased by eight-fold across a gradient extending outward from near the edge of the canopy to approximately 2 times the canopy radius (CR). This suggests that the {{influence of}} these species on hydrologic properties extends significantly into the intercanopy region. Analysis of biological soil crust cover within the intercanopy showed that beyond the gradient zone, increasing structural development of biological soil crust was associated with increased K(h).

40|$|The study {{compared}} {{plant and}} avian diversity and species composition between four habitats {{to review the}} potential implications of two distinct management practices on a forestry estate, namely to rehabilitate riparian zones to grasslands or woodlands as the two habitats that historically occurred on the property. The study habitats were Plantation (<b>Pinus</b> <b>trees</b> in riparian zone), Bushland (recently harvested), Grassland (cleared of broadleaf plants), and Woodland (control). At seven sampling sites per habitat, a vegetation assessment was conducted, while birds were caught with mist nests. Plant species richness increased from Plantation to Woodland, whereas most bird species and individuals were found in Bushland. Plant and bird species composition differed significantly between habitats. Bushland and Grassland birds were closely associated with exotic forbs. Grassland attracted birds with diverse habitat and nesting-site associations, and Woodland birds associated with woody plants. It is recommended {{that the majority of}} riparian zones be managed as grasslands, although the exact affect of the biennial summer burning and presence of exotic plants on birds needs to be investigated. To attract cavity-nesting birds to the Estate, some suitable riparian zones should be rehabilitated to Woodland by planting Ficus andAcacia trees, as these trees are the most abundant and frequently occurring in this habitat. Rather than manage avian diversity per se, the African stonechat in Grassland and lesser honeyguide in Woodland can be employed as indicators of the rehabilitation state of the riparian zones...|$|E
40|$|The {{systematic}} {{study of}} tree rings in western North America {{began with an}} intuitive insight by an astronomer, Andrew Ellicott Douglass. He was, {{before the turn of}} the 20 th century, working at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, and was interested in the cyclic nature of solar activity, particularly sunspots, and its relation to terrestrial climate. Since the written record of solar activity extended further back in time than the record of terrestrial weather, he envisioned tree growth as a proxy measure of climate. Douglass’ investigation began in 1901 and was based on the following premises: that the rings of a tree are a measure of its food supply; that the food supply depends largely on the amount of available moisture, especially in drier climates where the quantity of moisture is limited and the life struggle of the tree is against drought rather than competing vegetation; and that therefore the rings are a measure of precipitation (Douglass, 1914, page 321). His method involved first the preparation of a treegrowth curve, and for this purpose pine (<b>Pinus)</b> <b>trees</b> growing in the environs of Flagstaff were chosen. In addition to convenience, these trees had two obvious advantages. First, the moisture available to the trees was primarily in the form of precipitation and, second, the average age of the trees was nearly 350 years, with some more than 500 years old (Douglass, 1914, page 322). This latter quality allowed a large backward extension of the growth curve in the record of a single tree...|$|E

40|$|Australia has large {{plantations}} {{of exotic}} Pinus radiata conifers. This species is highly susceptible to Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, the pine wilt nematode, {{which is not}} found in Australia. Potentially pathogenic nematodes were isolated from several dead <b>Pinus</b> <b>trees</b> in Williamstown, Heidelberg and Knoxfield, suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria in 2000 - 2002. A survey of the above-ground nematode fauna of Pinus and other conifers in south [...] eastern Australia was undertaken. Stands of Pinus were surveyed in the Kuipto Forest and the South-East Region of SA; the south-west and the Gippsland region of Victoria; and the Hume region in NSW; and native Callitris preissii was sampled in the Murray Mallee. A total of 1140 samples from P. radiata, 50 from P. pinaster and 40 from C. preissii were examined. No nematodes were found in wood or young shoots of conifers except in the wood samples from diseased trees at Knoxfield and Heidelberg in Victoria. In contrast, nematodes were common in the bark samples of healthy trees. Morphologically, extracted nematodes were classified into five trophic groups, including: aphelenchida (plant, fungal and lichen feeders), rhabditids and areolaimids (bacterial feeding), Macrolaimus spp. (saprophagus), tylenchids (plant feeding), and dorylaimids (bacterial and algal feeders). Aphelenchids were the most commonly found trophic group. Three genera and twelve morphospecies of aphelenchids were identified. Eight species of Laimaphelenchus and one putative species of Acugutturus appear to be new records for Australia. Descriptions of two new species, L. preissii and L. australis have been published. Three species of Aphelenchoides were also found. No Bursaphelenchus spp. were found. Molecular studies included sequencing of the ITS region of Laimaphelenchus preissii, morphospecies Aphelenchid K 1, and Aphelenchid H 1; D 2 D 3 fragments of 28 S and 18 S of L. preissii, morphospecies Aphelenchid K 1, Aphelenchid K 2, and Aphelenchid H 1, Laimaphelenchus australis, and Laimaphelenchus Heidelberg; and COI of three aphelenchid morphospecies L. preissii, Laimaphelenchus Heidelberg and Aphelenchid K 1. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed that Laimaphelenchus spp. are new species and that the unknown aphelenchids are close to Aphelenchoides. None of the six isolates studied from Australia was close to Bursaphelenchus. Population growth and mean doubling time of L. preissii, Aphelenchid K 1 and Aphelenchid H 1 were studied at different temperatures and on different food resources. The different species had markedly different population growth rates, which were significantly affected by temperature and food. A study on desiccation was carried out with L. preissii and morphospecies Aphelenchid K 1, Aphelenchid K 2, Aphelenchid H 1 and Laimaphelenchus Heidelberg. Ability to survive desiccation varied between species, and the recovery rate of the different species was significantly different. A pathogenicity study was performed using young P. radiata trees in a shadehouse. No symptoms were observed following inoculation with Aphelenchid K 1, Aphelenchid K 2, Aphelenchid H 1 and Laimaphelenchus Heidelberg isolated from diseased P. radiata in Victoria, or L. preissii from native Callitris in South Australia.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis was the elucidation of the host-pathogen interaction between Pinus patula and Fusarium circinatum. This was accomplished by studying differential gene expression at the molecular level. Therefore, the first chapter reports the use of PCR-based methods in gene discovery and transcriptome analysis. The use of these techniques {{in the identification of}} novel transcripts in host-pathogen interactions addressed. These examples illustrate the differences and strong features of each technique. Chitinases are linked to defence responses in plants. In chapter tw 0, the induction of chitinases in P. patula was assessed at both the protein and genetic level. Western blot analysis and enzyme activity assays indicate that chitinase enzyme is not detected a part of the defence response by P. patula after infection by F. circinatum. This was further confirmed by the lack of significant induction of two Pinus chitinase genes, LP 6 and PSCHI 4, as determined by RT-PCR analysis. Partial DNA sequence homologues for the LP 6 and PSCH 14 genes were determined and compared with a variety of plant chitinases. The low levels of detectable chitinase induction in P. patula might explain the high levels of susceptibility to the pitch canker fungus observed in seedlings of this tree. Pinus patula, the most widely planted species in South Africa, is highly susceptible to infection by F. circinatum. In chapter three, suppression subtractive hybridisation was used to elucidate the changes taking place at the molecular level early on in this interaction. Most of the identified transcripts shared homology to both biotic and abiotic stress in plants. The induction of one fragment, displaying homology to phytocyanin proteins, as followed through RT-PCR. Induction levels for this fragment differed significantly between less and more susceptible plants. Although most of the sequences isolated in this study can be Iiked to stress, most have not been linked with specific plant-pathogen interactions. This raises questions in regard to the function of these genes in host-pathogen interactions. Further research identify the function of these sequences in the defence response will be needed. These sequences can also be tested against a family of <b>Pinus</b> <b>trees</b> to ascertain if they will be useful in marker assisted selection. A molecular analysis of culture degeneration and pathogenicity of F. circinatum was attempted in chapter four. In this chapter, the differential induction of transcripts in F. circinatum was determined against several other Fusarium spp. Several of he identified fragments shared homology with stress related proteins. One transcript shared homology to a polyketide synthase, FUM 5, that could be linked to fumonisin production in other Fusarium spp. ELISA detected no fumonisin production, although the FUM 5 transcripts were detected. The identification of all the transcripts could provide a basis for more intensive gene discovery studies in F. circinatum and other Fusarium spp. The induction of these sequences in different isolates needs to be studied to prove their function in F. circinatum. This study also complements several other studies that studied the morphological characteristics of culture degeneration. Resistance gene analogues have been reported from a diverge set of plant species. In chapter five, degenerate PCR amplification was used to isolate TI-NBS-LRR like resistance gene analogues from a range of Pinus species. These sequences w re further characterised through comparative analysis with previously reported Pinus resistance gene analogues. Through motif analysis, several of the known conserved motifs found in NBS domains were identified and conservation with other plant NBS motifs is indicated. The P-Ioop and GLPL motifs displayed a high level of conservation on amino acid level with other plant NBS motifs. However, slight differences in several of the conserved regions were observed when the Pinus analogues were compared with Arabidopsis thaliana. The identification of differences between angiosperm and gymnosperm NBS sequences indicates that design of new degenerate probes and primers for the isolation of more ancient NBS sequences is needed. Further, phylogenetic and structural analyses of these sequences will also aid in understanding the relationship between angiosperm and gymnosperm NBS sequences. The knowledge gained from such a study will highlight the similarities between angiosperm and gymnosperm defence responses. This study represents the first detailed report on RGA in Pinus.

40|$|The {{drylands}} of Chile {{are faced}} with continuous drought hazards that reduce their production potential and limit sustainable development. On the other hand, microcatchment harvesting has been promoted as a measure to reduce climate risk in drylands, but a quantitative assessment of their water use efficiency under a range of soil physical and climatic conditions {{has not yet been}} performed for those techniques actually used in Chile. The research in this dissertation was therefore divided in three main parts. In Part I the climatic uncertainty in the central-northern region of Chile was identified to evaluate the potential {{for the development of a}} drought early warning system. First, daily winter rainfall characteristics were compared for 42 stations in the region, and showed clear regional homogeneity as well as a strong interaction between seasonal rainfall amount and ENSO, suggesting potential predictability. This was further evaluated using three modelling approaches with increasing complexity. First, a simple univariate index of ENSO was found only well correlated for simultaneous (May or MJJA) values of the index, and thus not useful for prediction since lead times are insufficient for drought prediction. In a second approach, three General Circulation Models (GCMs) were used to forecast winter season rainfall amounts by a Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), finding the Climate Forecast System or CFS model most adequate for prediction purposes, due to its small bias and high skill. In a last approach, the rainfall field of the CFS was then used as a predictor for generating stochastic daily precipitation series in a non-homogeneous Hidden Markov Model (nHMM), from which seasonal rainfall characteristics were then calculated. The latter two methods produced similar and high correlations when hindcasting the seasonal precipitation in the period 1980 - 2005. They were also used to hindcast the Standardized Precipitation Index, and were able to reproduce the main seasonal characteristic (dry, normal or wet) in 88 - 92 % of the time. This indicates that the proposed methodology is effective in predicting drought for the region adequately. The last approach has, however, an added advantage for dryland management, because it can be used to derive daily information more relevant for dryland stakeholders, such as the accumulated daily precipitation deficit or the frequency of days exceeding a threshold precipitation (e. g. 15 mm dayP- 1 P). Ultimately, these predictions can also be coupled with water balance or crop models to transform the current climatic drought early warning system towards hydrologic or agronomic applications. In the second part of this dissertation another source of variability in the central-northern Chilean drylands was investigated, focussing on the heterogeneity of soil physical properties in soils with high stoniness. This was especially important for the modelling approach developed in Part III, which requires initial estimates of hydrophysical model parameters. Therefore, a comparison was made between six different measurement methods to determine the saturated hydraulic conductivity (KRfsR), in order to evaluate how the selection of a particular method can influence the KRfsR estimate, as well as to compare the applicability of the different methods on soils with embedded stone fragments and suggest a reference method. For each measurement method, also a range of calculation procedures for KRfsR were compared that could add to this parameter uncertainty. A clear relation was found between the different measurement methods, consistent over three different locations. The single (SR) and double ring (DR) infiltrometers resulted in similar, not significantly different values of KRfsR that were significantly higher whenR Rcompared to the other four methods. This would suggest that the combination of ponding water and ring insertion, altering the soil structure in the immediate surroundings of the ring, was not sufficiently accounted for by these methods in the case of stony soils. The two borehole methods applied, the inverse auger hole (IA) and constant head well (CH) method, also resulted in similar KRfsR estimates, but proved difficult to apply in soils with high stoniness, such as at the Romeral location. The remaining two methods, the rainfall simulator and tension infiltrometer, were characterized by their non-invasive character, as such providing a flawless method to determine KRfsR in these soils. When taking the water requirement into account, it is clear that the tension infiltrometer can be proposed as a reference method for stony soils. The effect of embedded stone fragments on hydrophysical characteristics was then investigated with more detail along a transect in a dryland watershed with highly variable gravimetric rock fragment content (RRmR) of 0. 05 0. 75 g gP- 1 P. A positive relation was found between RRmR and hydraulic conductivity, especially for high pressure potentials and under saturated conditions. The spatial variability of hydraulic conductivities measured along three transects in the watershed could be mainly related to differences in stone fragment contents, showing higher values on the eastern, drier slopes, in the riverbed, and on the steeper slopes, that are more prone to soil loss processes. On the other hand, soil water retention was negatively influenced by stone fragment contents, since the additional macro pore space cannot contribute sufficiently to compensate for the loss of soil matrix when replaced by the rock fragments. In accordance to the observations for KRfsR, the stone fragment content influence on soil water retention was largest near saturation and for the lower pressure potentials up to - 30 kPa, after which the influence of rock fragments became limited. Finally, in Part III different aspects of microcatchment water harvesting were investigated. As a transition from the previous part, we focused on the impact of infiltration trenches and reforestation on soil hydrophysical properties in two adjacent watersheds with different management. Thirteen years after implementation of infiltration trenches in a dryland watershed, clear differences in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were observed when compared to an unmanaged watershed. When extending the analysis to soil properties, some differences were encountered. Opposite slopes in the watersheds had a different particle size distribution, with the slopes more exposed to wind-driven rains showing a depletion of erodible fine sand fraction, and this was more pronounced in the unmanaged watershed. As could be expected, in the managed watershed the difference between the slopes was less, suggesting that the soil conservation techniques and reforestation have decreased the soil erosion hazard. The influence of infiltration trenches on soil properties was less pronounced. The clay fraction inside the trenches tended to be higher than outside the trenches, but was not significant for all trenches. Organic carbon and nitrogen content were higher inside the trenches, but no significant differences in other properties, such as KRfsR and available soil water capacity, could be established. A new framework was developed to evaluate the efficiency of microcatchment systems using a three-dimensional fully coupled surface-subsurface soil hydrological model, HydroGeoSphere (HGS). In a first step, the use of a rainfall simulator in combination with detailed soil water content measurements was evaluated to generate the data set required to auto-calibrate the HGS model. A sensitivity analysis indicated that six parameters contribute to the model solution, while three others were insensitive and were fixed to avoid model non-uniqueness. The remaining parameters proved not well correlated, as a requirement for parameter identifiability in the final model. As a last step in the evaluation of model well-posedness, data sets required to calibrate the model univocally were assessed for three different objective functions. Using both measured runoff data and soil moisture contents resulted in the lowest difference of modelled versus observed values. As a result, the calibrated model fitted well to the observed data series of soil moisture and runoff (correlation coefficient of 0. 97), and a response surface analysis confirmed reaching a well defined global minimum during the inversion process. The final model also effectively simulated trench overfilling, while the moisture content profile of the slope showed a marked increase in the water content just below and near to the infiltration trench, confirming the water harvesting potential of these techniques for reforestation purposes. The spatial extent of this increase was limited to the immediate surroundings of the trench. Nevertheless, model simulations with different characteristic rainfall seasons typically observed in the region showed clearly that rainfall intensities were insufficient to generate enough runoff for efficient water harvesting, except during an extremely wet year. This indicates that the climatic and soil physical constraints operating at that location limit the applicability of the microcatchment technique. This was further evaluated for a hillslope at a much more southern location, where the newly developed framework was used to determine water harvesting design schemes, considering interaction of different infiltration trenches. The hillslope model with six infiltration trenches was calibrated and validated using runoff observations from simulated and natural rainfall events during the rainfall seasons from 1996 to 1998, conserving general infiltration-runoff patterns. Under these climatic and soil physical conditions, important runoff reductions (44 – 90 %) were simulated when compared to a bare plot without infiltration trenches, but significant runoff amounts could not be buffered under the (very) wet conditions occurring at least every eight years. As such, two different strategies were developed to improve the design of the infiltration trenches for the study location. First, the empirical MAUCO approach was tested as a design method, resulting in a considerably drop in runoff amounts in both dry and wet years, confirming that this approach can be used to design soil conservation measures. Secondly, a new approach was then tested to select a correct infiltration trench design for an Eucalyptus globulus forest plantation with the HGS, based on a detailed water balance analysis. In order to increase the plant beneficial water fluxes (transpiration), the trench distance of 4 m resulted in an acceptable trade-off between potential yield per tree and limited losses by runoff, deep drainage, evaporation, non-target transpiration and open water evaporation. Finally, the evaluation of microcatchment systems was oriented towards aspects of tree survival and productivity. Here, three different microcatchment treatments (infiltration trenches, microterraces and rototilling) and two combined treatments were tested on tree plantation of Eucalyptus globulus and Pinus radiata in the central Chilean drylands. First, the behaviour of the soil water potential directly below the different treatments was compared, showing higher moisture contents during a longer period under the microterraces and on the plot where rototilling was observed when compared to a control plot without treatments, and these differences were consistent for the two different measurement locations. The moisture content was highest near to the trench (0. 6 m), decreasing rapidly at larger distances, confirming the rather small spatial extent of the trench influence on water availability and tree growth. Secondly, the different treatments showed a clear improvement of Eucalyptus tree survival rates after two dry seasons, while this was less clear for <b>Pinus</b> <b>trees,</b> due to the higher vulnerability of Eucalyptus to prolonged dry spells during establishment. Tree biomass proved (significantly) higher for the plot with microterraces and rototilling, but this was more pronounced for Eucalyptus than for <b>Pinus</b> <b>trees.</b> The trench had only a small effect on tree productivity, mostly on trees near to the trench. From this dissertation, it is clear that these techniques can result in additional sources of soil water for increased plant productivity, if they are correctly dimensioned and implemented...|$|E
40|$|Western Australia's wildflowers are {{recognized}} {{throughout the world}} for their colour, form and uniqueness. Many {{can be observed in}} the metropolitan area close to the city of Perth. Despite this, there has been very little scholarly documentation of them. This book provides an account of the flora of Murdoch University. Though the campus was disturbed first by farming and later by arboriculture, small but significant areas of the original bush remain. This scholarly account provides a valuable record of those native species that enrich the Murdoch campus after the first ten years of its operation. It should prove useful as a data base for future conservation and planning strategies, as well as providing a valuable reference source for staff and students. It should also have strong appeal to local residents who are curious about the plants which characterize the white and yellow sands of their surrounds and as a guide for visitors to the campus. The work, though written for the amateur naturalist, is scientifically sound and attempts to simplify the identification of plants using ink drawings and colour photographs in combination with keys. The Murdoch University community is grateful to those of its members whose enthusiasm and skill have made possible this lasting contribution to the celebration of our tenth anniversary. I congratulate them. RONALD WILSON KBE, CMG, LLM Penn., LLB HonLLD W. Aust Chancellor, Murdoch University INTRODUCTION TO THE VEGETATION Background Murdoch University lies at the interface of two dune systems on the western third of the Swan Coastal Plain. To the west lie the tall Spearwood Dunes, mainly yellow sands over limestone. The older and highly leached white sands of the Bassendean Dune system lie to the east. Separating the two systems is a chain of freshwater lakes and wetlands, the closest to Murdoch being North Lake. Murdoch is part of the once extensive eucalypt/banksia woodland that clothed the well-drained ridges of much of the metropolitan area. Quite subtle changes in elevation, slope, drainage and soil chemistry provide a range of habitats resulting in a rich and diverse flora. As a result the Murdoch flora contains not only elements of the Kwongan sandplain vegetation (heathlands on infertile soils, e. g. Calectasia cyanea, Daviesia triflora), but units or species characteristic of the jarrah forest (e. g. Banksia grandis, Eucalyptus marginata), coastal woodlands on calcareous soils (e. g. Eucalyptus gomphocephala, Olearia axillaris) and freshwater wetlands (e. g. Astarte a fascicularis, Melaleuca preissiana). Trees form the dominant and most familiar components in the region. Of the 200 indigenous species now on campus it is perhaps surprising that only fifteen reach the stature of trees (defined as plants with a single woody trunk and over 4 metres in height). There are four species of eucalypts, two paperbarks, five banksias, and one she-oak, Christmas tree, woody pear and acacia. Clearly, therefore, most diversity {{is to be found in}} the shrub and herbaceous communities and much of this book is devoted to these groups. The number of species and their present distributions have been strongly affected by agriculture and forestry pursuits. Recent History Parts of the southern half of Murdoch were used to graze cattle, horses and sheep until the mid 1970 s. The grazing must, however, have been light in the existing Banksia Woodland because the under-storey is quite intact and there is little weed growth. Limited cropping was also undertaken. Earlier, Chinese market gardeners established vegetable plots near the south-east corner of Melaleuca Swamp. Part of the market garden now has Melaleuca regrowth and the raised beds can still be seen in aerial photographs. Just to the west of the old gardens lies a narrow raised track lined on the eastern side by a single row of <b>Pinus</b> <b>trees.</b> This track once passed north, up the main campus ridge and onto where Riseley Street is today. These and other tracks i n the area were probably once used to haul jarrah logs and billets to small local saw-pits or further afield on the limestone track (now Leach Highway) to mills in Fremantle. A few large jarrah stumps remain on campus, e. g. below Bush Court. In addition to jarrah, tuart was also felled for timber. This species is at the eastern edge of its range, and there are a few remaining trees in Bush Court. The northern half of, Murdoch was part of the University of Western Australia Endowment Land (Cockburn Sound Location 549). In March 1926 an agreement was made between the University of Western Australia and the Conservator of Forests whereby the Forests Department undertook to establish a pine plantation. The area was to be cleared and planted at the rate of 100 acres per annum and the lease period was fifty years. The scheme was inaugurated at a time when there was a strong movement to get parliamentary permission to sell Endowment Lands, and was a challenge by members of the University of Western Australia Senate to find a way to use them profitably. The following description of the. Somerville plantation is from The West Australian (31 May 1938) - 'The plantation was divided into areas of about 25 acres, each of which was ' surrounded by a firebreak 15 feet wide. Each group of four such areas was surrounded by a firebreak one chain wide and each 300 acre lot was surrounded by a two-chain firebreak. The trees were planted about 7 feet apart'. Wildfires in the Somerville area were small and frequent, for example there were sixty-one in the 1 973 - 74 season. In the early 1960 s a lookout tower was erected west of Kardinya to replace the treetop lookout on the edge of South Street. Most of the Murdoch section was planted from 1937 to 1940 with Pinus pinaster. A small area of P. radiata was planted near South Street in 1955. Later, the beginning of the construction programme for Murdoch University was symbolically marked by the felling of one tree on 7 February 1973...|$|E
