5|$|The {{game was}} first {{proposed}} by Nintendo producer Kaori Ando, who envisioned a crossover between the Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tensei series. Although initially reluctant {{due to their}} workload, Atlus agreed to the collaboration, {{and much of the}} early work went into deciding what genre of game {{it was going to be}} and how best to incorporate both series while creating an original game.

5|$|Shooting long {{scenes in}} a zero-g {{environment}} was a challenge. Eventually, the team {{decided to use}} computer-generated imagery for the spacewalk scenes and automotive robots to move Bullock's character for interior space station scenes. This meant that shots and blocking had to be planned well in advance for the robots to be programmed. It also made the <b>production</b> <b>period</b> much longer than expected.

5|$|The film {{required}} a lengthy <b>production</b> <b>period,</b> taking {{over a year}} for the casting to be completed and another year and three months for editing. Burshtein, who was doubtful as to how much of the process would be completed, took a step-by-step approach, focusing first on the writing, then on accumulating enough funding for the project, followed by the filming and editing. Burshtein became the first Orthodox Jewish woman to direct a film intended for wide distribution. The film premiered at the 69th Venice Film Festival on 1 September 2012 and was later released in the United States on 24 May 2013.|$|E
5|$|However, as {{the fifth}} season's <b>production</b> <b>period</b> entered its final months, rumors began to {{circulate}} – {{especially among the}} production crew members in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada – {{about the future of}} the series, particularly concerning whether the show would be moving to Los Angeles, California for the sixth season and whether the new recurring character of Jeffrey Spender was planned (in case David Duchovny cut back his commitment to the series) to become a replacement for Duchovny's character of Fox Mulder – either as a part-time or full-fledged substitute. Other, contradictory rumors that Owens heard were that either he or Duchovny would appear in only eight episodes of the sixth season and that his casting as Spender was a sign that the series would either be leaving Vancouver or staying there. According to the actor himself, he always knew that Duchovny would not be leaving the series but only discovered that The X-Files would indeed be moving to Los Angeles when the official announcement was made.|$|E

40|$|Cyclical scheduling, {{where the}} time between <b>production</b> <b>periods</b> for each item is constant, offers {{simplicity}} and ease of control compared with noncyclical scheduling, where <b>production</b> <b>periods</b> are irregularly spaced. However, when demands are dynamic, flexibility in the spacing of <b>production</b> <b>periods</b> permits noncyclical scheduling to result in lower total costs. This study investigates the additional cost of cyclical scheduling. We focus upon the capacitated lot sizing problem (CLSP), which deals with planning production on a single, capacitated machine serving multiple items with dynamic demands. To establish cyclical schedules, a mathematical programming model is developed along with a heuristic solution technique and a Lagrangian-based lower bounding procedure. For problems solved in this study, differences between solution costs and lower bounds average less than 1 %. Experiments {{are performed to evaluate}} the heuristic technique and to compare cyclical schedules with noncyclical ones. For comparison purposes, a noncyclical heuristic and problem sets from the literature are used. New problems based upon operating data from Ford Motor Company are also generated and solved. In this study, cyclical schedules average 4. 4 % higher in cost than noncyclical ones. Coefficient of demand variation most seriously influences differences in costs. Other significant factors include capacity utilization, setup time, time between orders, and number of items. production planning, lot sizing, heuristics, capacity constraints...|$|R
25|$|During the {{relatively}} short <b>production</b> <b>period</b> of the FTO there were original equipment catalogues {{of a host}} of options made available. Many items were cosmetic in nature, such as stickers or chromed goods, although more substantial styling pieces such as side skirts and spoilers were also available. Practical items such as a passenger air bag, installed in the dashboard above the glove box, or ski-racks were also listed. There were also special 15 and 16inch PIAA alloy wheels. Strut braces, as found standard on the GP Version R for example and machine-stamped 'RalliArt', were also available via the Mitsubishi association with the Ralliart franchise.|$|E
25|$|A {{whiteboard}} grid {{is used to}} plan episodes a {{few weeks}} in advance, based on release schedules, events like E3, interviews, and other segments. They try to time reviews so they occur before or in the week the game is released, however, being a television show with a longer <b>production</b> <b>period</b> than most online content, {{this is not always}} possible. One challenge is having publishers provide games early enough to be reviewed and filmed in time. Often they receive debug code which can only be played on debug consoles, and developers are usually still working out kinks, so will provide a list of bugs for the team to take into account. Good Game also have to be wary of embargo dates as reviews can't be broadcast before then. Even if the embargo ends a few hours after a Good game episode, the review must be held back for a week. Sometimes, Good Game can only get a copy of the game after it is released, and Bajo points out that while this is sometimes due to random factors it can also be a sign that the game is bad. They try to avoid having too many of the same type of game in each week, and try to include games on all consoles. They hope that all this will ensure there is something for everyone.|$|E

Initial production occurred in September, with Gaiman visiting the set during the <b>production</b> <b>period</b> and filming for the associated Confidential.

The scenes where Amy and Rory are on the run allowed the audience to explore the TARDIS outside the control room, something the producers had wanted {{to do for a}} while. A series of corridors was constructed and retained for future use. The episode also featured the return of the older TARDIS control room from the Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant era. Gaiman had originally wanted to reconstruct a console room from the original series, but the cost proved prohibitive. The set was retained after filming for [...] "The Eleventh Hour", but has since been removed {{to become part of the}} Doctor Who Experience exhibit.

Particles were then counted and their sizes and composition determined by SEM and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis (EDXA). The mean numbers and sizes of most alumina wear particles did not differ for both <b>production</b> <b>periods,</b> but the larger sizes of particle in group 1 point to more severe surface destruction.

40|$|Discussed {{methodology}} of forecasting and forecast {{of demand for}} energy carriers have been presented in two parts.

When forecasting the scale of demand for individual energy carriers by lorries in a given year, the following issues were taken into account: estimated numbers of vehicles registered according to categories and <b>production</b> <b>periods,</b> an estimated average consumption of fuels per 100 km of mileage according to specified categories of vehicles and their <b>production</b> <b>periods,</b> estimated average annual mileages of vehicles according to categories and <b>production</b> <b>periods.</b> A drop {{in the use of}} petrols by lorries in Poland is expected to have taken place by the year 2020. The estimated forecast level amounts to 315 - 325 Gg. The use of petrols in 2020 would decrease to the level of 55 - 57 % of the consumption in the initial period of the forecast. An estimated increase in the demand for diesel fuels by lorries is expected to take place in Poland in 2020 and it is envisaged to reach the level of 5848 - 7680 Gg, which compared to the consumption in the initial period of the forecast, would be tantamount to an increase dynamics of 170 - 223 %. The demand for LPG fuels by lorries in 2020 should amount to 264 - 287 Gg, (an increase of 147 - 160 % compared to the initial period of the forecast).
