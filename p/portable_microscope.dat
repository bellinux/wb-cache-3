In optical DNA mapping, intact large single DNA molecules are labeled, stretched out, and imaged using a fluorescence microscope. This means that sequence information ranging over hundreds of kilobasepairs (kbp) can be obtained in one single image. Nanochannels offer homogeneous and efficient stretching of DNA that is crucial to maximize the information that can be obtained from optical DNA maps. In this review, we highlight progress in the field of optical DNA mapping in nanochannels. We discuss the different protocols for sequence specific labeling and divide them into two main categories, enzymatic labeling and affinity-based labeling. Examples are highlighted where optical DNA mapping is used to gain information on length scales that would be inaccessible with traditional techniques. Enzymatic labeling has been commercialized and is mainly used in human genetics and assembly of complex genomes, while the affinity-based methods have primarily been applied in bacteriology, for example for rapid analysis of plasmids encoding antibiotic resistance. Next, we highlight how the design of nanofluidic channels can been altered in order to obtain the desired information and discuss how recent advances in the field make it possible to retrieve information beyond DNA sequence.

As such, pluripotent cell lines are of great interest as starting material for drug screening and cell therapies for regenerative treatment of diseased tissues. Pluripotent cell lines were originally derived from germ cell tumors (embryonal carcinoma cells; EC), but have since been isolated and expanded from the inner cell mass of an early embryo (human embryonic stem cells; hESCs). This project set out to investigate the relative ability of the pluripotent NTERA 2 (EC) cell line and hESC lines: Shef 3, HUES 7 and RH 5, to differentiate into neurons, using mechanical and enzymatic culture methods. Focus was placed on monitoring differentiation efficiency and function between the different lines. The tumour origin, {{in addition to the}} poor reproducibility, low yield and reduced functionality of NTERA 2 derived neurons, compared to primary neurons, makes their incorporation into regenerative therapies unlikely. As such, an enhanced neuronal differentiation protocol was developed for use in hESCs. Cell populations were monitored for relative changes in gene and protein expression at selected time points throughout differentiation using standard RT-PCR, Q-PCR and immuno fluorescence analysis. End stage neurons were screened for functionality using patch clamping and calcium imaging techniques. Monitoring of cellular behavior through differentiation was aided by the concurrent development of a <b>portable</b> <b>microscope</b> incubator stage in collaboration with Linkam scientific Ltd.

In this research study, the main objective is to achieve the performance equal to or better than the manual microscopy, which is the gold standard in malaria diagnosis, in order to produce a reliable automated diagnostic platform without expert intervention, for the effective treatment and eradication of the deadly disease. The work contributed to the field of mathematical morphology by proposing a novel method called the Annular Ring Ratio transform for blood component identification. It has also proposed an automated White Blood Cell and Red Blood Cell differentiation algorithm, which when combined with ARR transform method, has wide applications not only for malaria diagnosis but also for many blood related analysis involving microscopic examination.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{development}} of <b>portable</b> <b>microscopes,</b> which enable the noninvasive bedside evaluation of the sublingual microcirculation in critically ill patients, has expanded the clinical research on this level of the cardiovascular system. Several semi-quantitative scores have been defined {{in order to provide}} researchers with a standardized framework for the offline assessment of the microcirculation status. Among those, space-time diagrams (STDs) constitute an established method for obtaining an estimate of the red blood cells (RBCs) flow velocity in capillaries. However, STDs have the drawback of being time-consuming, inherently subjective, and difficult to manage when the flow is not regular. In this work we propose an automated method for calculating erythrocyte flow speed, aiming to provide a fast and objective tool for the evaluation of peripheral blood perfusion. The proposed method exploits an image segmentation module for estimating the positions of candidate flowing cells. A multi-object tracking algorithm based on Kalman filters analyzes and matches the positions corresponding to specific erythrocytes within consecutive frames. Thus, the output of the filter enables to estimate the displacement of each cell, yielding their instantaneous speed. The method has been validated against the results obtained by the manual analysis of STDs, proving a good agreement for speeds up to 300 μm s- 1. At higher speeds, RBC tracking becomes unstable due to the currently limited video acquisition rate (25 Hz) of state-of-the-art devices, that makes the matching between objects appearing in consecutive frames very challengin...|$|R

40|$|Malaria is {{a serious}} {{parasitic}} infection causing intermittent fever and chills. In resource-limited regions, young children infected with malaria have high mortality; therefore, children with flu-like symptoms are often presumptively treated with anti-malarial drugs. This practice can prematurely deplete drug resources and ultimately increase the potential for drug resistance. Current malaria diagnostic tests rely on fingerprick blood samples, requiring consumables that increase per-test costs. There is a clear need for a rapid malaria diagnostic test amenable to the point-of-care. This thesis describes a needle-free method to diagnose malaria. A <b>portable</b> <b>microscope</b> system was designed and constructed to image blood cells circulating through the microvasculature in vivo. Malaria-infected cells were detected using the endogenous malaria biomarker hemozoin. This approach was assessed in increasingly complex biological environments, demonstrating the ability to detect P. yoelii infection in vivo in a mouse model of malaria over a clinically relevant range of parasitemia. An automated image processing algorithm was developed to rapidly identify and quantify circulating hemozoin particles circulating in vivo. The diagnostic performance of the automated algorithm was comparable to manual detection, with accuracy of 89 % using blood smear microscopy as the gold standard. Next, an algorithm was developed to classify infected-red blood cells from hemozoin-containing white blood cells which persist after infection has resolved. Discrimination using hemozoin signal features measured in vitro yielded an algorithm with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0. 92 and 0. 93 for P. yoelii and P. falciparum respectively. This algorithm successfully discriminated between active and recent malaria infections in vivo in an animal model, furthering the diagnostic accuracy of this approach. Additionally, in vivo microscopy was evaluated with optical tissue phantoms for the ability to detect other blood-related diseases, specifically microfilarial infections and anemia. Microfilariae were detected over a clinically relevant dynamic range with a positive linear correlation with blood smear microscopy. Hemoglobin absorbance measured by in vivo microscopy yielded hemoglobin concentrations within ± 1. 5 g/dL, using a point-of-care device as the gold standard. Collectively these results demonstrate {{the potential for a}} robust diagnostic platform for blood-borne parasitic infections and anemia amenable to the point-of-care...|$|E
40|$|The 3 D {{printing}} industry has seen {{rapid growth in}} the last 10 years and {{has been called the}} next industrial revolution. There are several different processes used in 3 D printing, but the most popular process is called Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) or Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). This is the process where (most commonly) plastic filament enters a nozzle, is heated to a semi-liquid state, and then deposited into a pattern to create a print. One major drawback to this process is that the prints are anisotropic. This means that the strength of the print varies with the orientation that it was created. This project experimented to determine if a proposed post processing method would decrease the anisotropy in the FFF process. The proposed process involved using a high intensity lamp to flash the print after each layer is printed. The theory was that this would decrease the gap between deposited filaments and from research this was a proven way to make prints stronger. For this project, a Xenon Sinteron 2000 was used as the high intensity lamp and a Printrbot Simple Metal Plus was used as the 3 D printer. Three experiments were done to determine if the Sinteron would be successful in reducing the gap between deposited filaments. The first experiment was done by flashing the surface of completed prints and then using a <b>portable</b> <b>microscope</b> to measure the height of the surface layer and necking between deposited filaments. The data were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA and the results did not conclude that the Sinteron was successful in reducing the gap. The second experiment was analyzed visually using an optical microscope and revealed that Sinteron might be able to reduce the gap on prints that are solid. The third experiment was analyzed using an optical microscope and the area of the gaps were measured using ImageJ software. The results concluded that the Sinteron was not successful in reducing the gap. The quantitative data from these experiments suggest that the proposed processing method would not be successful in reducing the anisotropy of 3 D printed parts created by the FFF process. The recommendation is to investigate post processing methods such as a heat gun that would apply heat evenly across a layer...|$|E
40|$|Computational {{resources}} are constantly becoming faster, cheaper and more portable. Coupled with mass {{production and the}} use of sophisticated hardware components in the consumer electronics market, the abundance of computational power opens numerous opportunities in reducing the cost and extending the capabilities of traditional biomedical imaging and sensing devices. Toward this end, myriad computational imaging methods have been devised; among them is lensfree holographic imaging that provides a portable, cost- effective and yet powerful alternative to traditional bright field microscopy tools. Additionally, lensfree microscopy provides significantly larger fields-of-view (e. g., 30 mm 2) when compared to a typical bright-field transmission microscope with comparable resolution (e. g., 60 - 100 ï¿½ objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0. 8 - 1. 0). This dissertation introduces the unique architecture of lensfree on-chip microscopy, its computational reconstruction methods, and several biomedical-imaging applications that utilize on-chip imaging. Lensfree microscopy has a distinct architecture when compared to other imaging systems. First, rather than recording a direct image of the specimen, an on-chip in-line hologram is acquired. In addition, the sample is positioned in close proximity to the image sensor (typically sub-mm); and finally, lenses are not used between the object and the image sensor. These unique attributes enable the simplification of the microscope's hardware to solely an image sensor and a partially coherent light source (both temporally and spatially), thus resulting in a cost-effective and <b>portable</b> <b>microscope</b> where hardware is replaced with computational reconstruction methods. These computational methods can push the resolution of the on-chip microscope to a deeply sub-micron range (e. g., 225 nm) by employing pixel-super-resolution, a method that synthesizes one high-resolution image from various lower resolution images of the same object. Additionally, to image dense and confluent samples, multi-height-based phase- recovery is introduced in partially coherent holography. This iterative method recovers the lost phase of an optical field from few intensity measurements, each captured with a different sample-to-sensor distance. Lastly, to provide accurate colorization, especially challenging for holographic methods, two different algorithms are utilized, one based on Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, and the other based on the YUV color space. Based on these computational reconstruction blocks, the performance of lensfree on-chip microscopy can be demonstrated in various biomedical imaging applications that require both high-resolution and high-throughput, including Papanicolaou smears, human breast cancer slides and sickle cell anemia blood smears...|$|E

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the design and}} evaluation of a portable bright-field and fluorescence microscope that can be manufactured for $ 240 USD. The microscope uses a battery-operated LED-based flashlight as the light source and achieves a resolution of 0. 8 µm at 1000 × magnification in fluorescence mode. We tested the diagnostic capability of this new instrument to identify infections caused by the human pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Sixty-four direct, decontaminated, and serially diluted smears were prepared from sputa obtained from 19 patients suspected to have M. tuberculosis infection. Slides were stained with auramine orange and evaluated as being positive or negative for M. tuberculosis with both the new <b>portable</b> fluorescence <b>microscope</b> and a laboratory grade fluorescence microscope. Concordant results were obtained in 98. 4 % of cases. This highly portable, low cost, fluorescence microscope may be a useful diagnostic tool to expand the availability of M. tuberculosis testing at the point-of-care in low resource settings...|$|R
40|$|This project {{establishes}} {{an educational}} and scientific partnership between {{elementary and middle}} school students, a regional university, and a national scientific laboratory, all focusing on the science and mathematics of snowflake formation. Students will conduct fieldwork investigations using <b>portable</b> digital <b>microscopes,</b> laptop computers, and cameras to record snowflake patterns. They will study the geometric patterns formed by snowflake tessellations and compare their findings to the contributing weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and air pressure. They will capture digital images of snowflakes and reconstruct the snowflake formation path within the clouds using an online snowflake applet. Snowflake data will be shared between the fourth grade and eighth grade classrooms through a collaborative website and mentoring visits from scientists. The growing dataset will be submitted to the National Science Digital Library (NSDL) - Atmospheric Visualization Collection and the Digital Library for Earth Systems Education (DLESE) for national access. A slide presentation is available to describe the project. Educational levels: Middle school, Intermediate elementary...|$|R
