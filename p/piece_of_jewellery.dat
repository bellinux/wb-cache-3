5|$|Alongside {{traditional}} piercing techniques, modern body adornment includes variant {{techniques such}} as pocketing and flesh stapling, although as of 2007 these were still not widely made available by piercers. In the first of these, a scalpel opens the skin or mucous membranes, into which the larger end of a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>jewellery</b> or—if using a bar—two ends are inserted. These kinds of piercings {{may be difficult to}} remove, as fibrous tissue can form around the end or ends of the jewellery or the implanted tube into which the jewellery is placed. When a bar is used, pocketing looks quite similar to flesh stapling. The latter technique is frequently done {{in the form of a}} ladder. Modern body piercing practices also include dermal anchoring or dermal piercing, which combines piercing and implantation to create a single point of opening in the body (whereas pocketing creates two) to permit one end of the jewellery to show above the surface of the skin. While this technique can be performed almost anywhere on the body, as of 2007 it was popularly done between the eyes, on the chest, or on the finger, to simulate a ring.|$|E
25|$|In China, {{the most}} {{uncommon}} <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>jewellery</b> is the earring, which was worn neither by men nor women. Amulets were common, {{often with a}} Chinese symbol or dragon. Dragons, Chinese symbols, and phoenixes were frequently depicted on jewellery designs.|$|E
25|$|An earring is a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>jewellery</b> {{attached}} to the ear via a piercing in the earlobe or another external part of the ear (except {{in the case of}} clip earrings, which clip onto the lobe). Earrings are worn by both sexes, although more common among women, and have been used by different civilizations in different times.|$|E

25|$|Also, 3D {{printing}} as {{a production}} technique gains {{more and more}} importance. With {{a great variety of}} services offering this production method, jewellery design becomes accessible to a growing number of creatives. An important advantage of using 3d printing are the relatively low costs for prototypes, small batch series or unique and personalized designs. Shapes that are hard or impossible to create by hand can often be realized by 3D printing. Popular materials to print include Polyamide, steel and wax (latter for further processing). Every printable material has its very own constraints that have to be considered while designing the <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>jewellery</b> using 3D Modelling Software.|$|E
25|$|On 5 October 2009, a {{motorway}} worker found {{a plastic}} bin bag containing bones {{while he was}} clearing a vegetation patch on a slip road at Junction 14 of the M5 motorway. The bones in the bag included a skull, pelvis and thigh bone and further remains were found buried and spread around the field {{by the side of}} the motorway. Police confirmed that the remains were human, and they showed a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>jewellery</b> found at the site to Mr and Mrs Hall, who confirmed that it had belonged to their daughter. Despite this, police refused to confirm that the body was that of Miss Hall until a post-mortem had been carried out. The remains were formally identified as being Hall's through dental records on 7 October. She had incurred severe blunt trauma to her head during her ordeal, resulting in a fractured skull, cheekbone and jaw. Hall had also been tied up with a thin blue rope.|$|E

2500|$|Callas's {{relationship}} with La Scala had also started to become strained after the Edinburgh incident, and this effectively severed her major ties with her artistic home. Later in 1958, Callas and Rudolf Bing were in discussion about her {{season at the}} Met. She was scheduled to perform in Verdi's La traviata and in Macbeth, two very different operas which almost require totally different singers. Callas and the Met could not reach an agreement, and before the opening of Medea in Dallas, Bing sent a telegram to Callas terminating her contract. Headlines of [...] "Bing Fires Callas" [...] appeared in newspapers around the world. Nicola Rescigno later recalled, [...] "That night, {{she came to the}} theater, looking like an empress: she wore an ermine thing that draped to the floor, and she had every <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>jewellery</b> she ever owned. And she said, 'You all know what's happened. Tonight, for me, is a very difficult night, and I will need the help of every one of you.' Well, she proceeded to give a performance [...] that was historical." ...|$|E

40|$|Most {{objects in}} our lives are barely noticed and {{not much more than}} {{consumer}} goods. Some objects, however, become so important to people that they start to shape their understanding of their self. This paper looks at how some <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>jewellery</b> become parts <b>of</b> what we call the core self. The study collected stories about jewellery in Helsinki and Chicago between 2008 and 2010. The key process that transforms some <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>jewellery</b> to constituent parts of the self is family history and connections that some pieces create between generations of women. We close the paper by arguing that design researchers need {{to pay more attention to}} social processes that turn some objects into heirlooms, rather than focus on consumption only.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "whatever {{the means}} employed, the {{engineering}} process was perfectly successful. Love {{was made to}} find out a way. On the afternoon before Kuno was {{to go back to}} prison, two Sisters of Charity walked out of the hospital gates, crossed the square in front of it, glided down the narrow streets towards the river, boarded a tram at the bridge, and did not descend till the car had reached its terminus in the farther suburbs. They began to walk briskly along the high road out into the country. 'Look!' said one of them, when they were clear of the houses; and with the gesture of a conjurer produced from nowhere a red leather purse. 'Where did it come from?' asked the other, opening her eyes. Memories of Elisha and the ravens, of the widow's cruse, of the loaves and fishes, must have floated through the radiant fog in poor Melpomene's mind. 'The old lady I was sitting next to in the tram left her bag open. Nothing could have been simpler.' 'Kuno! You don't mean to say you stole it?' Kuno swore horribly. He had opened the purse. 'Only sixty marks. Who'd have thought that an old camel, all dressed up in silk and furs, would only have sixty marks in her purse. And I must have a thousand at least to get away. It's easy to reconstruct the rest of the conversation down to the inevitable, 'For God's sake, shut up,' with which Kuno put an end to Melpomene's dismayed moralising. They trudge on in silence. Kuno thinks desperately. Only sixty marks; he can do nothing with that. If only he had something to sell, a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>jewellery,</b> some gold or silver anything, anything. He knows such a good place for selling things. Is he to be caught again for lack of a few marks? Melpomene is also thinking. Evil must often be done that good may follow. After all, had not she herself stolen Sister Mary of the Purification's clothes when she was asleep after night duty? Had not she run away from the convent, broken her vows? And yet how convinced she was that she was doing rightly! The mysterious Powers emphatically approved; she felt sure of it. And now there was the red purse. But what was a red purse in comparison with a saved soul--and, after all, what was she doing hut saving Kuno's soul?" [...] Miss Penny, who had adapted the voice and gestures of a debater asking rhetorical questions, brought her hand with a slap on to the table. [...] "Lord, what a bore this sort of stuff is!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Let's {{get to the end of}} this dingy anecdote as quickly as possible. By this time, you must imagine, the shades of night were falling fast--the chill November twilight, and so on; but I leave the natural descriptions to you. Kuno gets into the ditch at the roadside and takes off his robes. One imagines that he would feel himself safer in trousers, more capable of acting with decision in a crisis. They tramp on for miles. Late in the evening they leave the high road and strike up through the fields towards the forest. At the fringe of the wood they find one of those wheeled huts where the shepherds sleep in the lambing season.|$|E
