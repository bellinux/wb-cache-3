40|$|International audienceRecently, ionic liquids {{have been}} {{proposed}} as a promising <b>plasticizing</b> <b>agents</b> of starch. In this work, starch was treated with ionic liquid to obtain thermoplastic starch (TPS). The effects of supercritical carbon dioxide (ScCO 2) on the processing of starch with 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride (BMIMCI) were also studied. For this purpose, the effects of different operating parameters such as temperature, pressure and processing time on the structural and thermal properties of TPS were evaluated. The results suggest that carbon dioxide leads to a low change of crystalline structure and this change is primarily influenced by temperature processing. Furthermore, the use of supercritical CO 2 with different pressures and temperatures induces a decrease of the glass transition compared to formulations without it.

Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was used to characterize the microstructure of both amorphous and preannealed materials. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide-angle X-ray scattering, and density measurements were also performed for the PET samples, and reference is made to similar analysis work done for MePEEK.

In this study, high density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic resin was incorporated with untreated PPF at four different weight percentages namely, 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt%. Each mixture was compounded via twin screw extruder prior to compression moulding into film sheets with thickness of 0. 15 mm. Maleic anhydride (MAH) and glycerol were used as compatibilizer and <b>plasticizing</b> <b>agents.</b> The effect of PPF loading on the tensile strength and the surface morphology were the main interest. It was found that by increasing the PPF contents had increased the stiffness of the films but reduced the tensile strength and elongation at break due to weak interfacial adhesion between HDPE matrix and PPF. This was probably due to insufficient amount of MAH to compatabilize the increasing amount of PPF, thus resulting non-uniform PPF distribution across the HDPE matrix. The findings were supported by SEM micrographs which showed rough surface and the disruption of the continuous phase of HDPE matrix, thus weakening the strength and flexibility of the samples.

40|$|In {{addition}} to the barrier properties against water vapor and oxygen, inorganic-organic polymers can also function as protection layers against unwanted migration of chemical substances in two ways. First, hybrid polymers prevent components from migrating out of polymer substrates. This is of special interest for polymeric materials containing substances like <b>plasticizing</b> <b>agents,</b> unreacted monomers or catalysts. Thus the olfactory nuisance and the toxicological emission are decreased. The plastics are also prevented from becoming prematurely brittle. Second, the coated materials are also protected against the interaction of dyes or dirt staining the material. These functions {{can be achieved by}} thermally or UV curable coating materials, synthesized by the sol-gel technique. Since several polymer materials show only a low heat resistance (e. g. PVC, polyolefines), this publication is focussed on the development of new migration barriers based on photochemically curable sols. Another advantage of the UV process in comparison to thermal treatments are the short curing times and low power consumption which make this process even more attractive for industrial applications. The coatings were characterized by IR and solid state NMR spectroscopy. The migration barrier properties were tested according to industrial standards. Due to the choice of specific functional groups, these hybrid polymers can be further modified in order to combine the migration barrier function with additional properties: scratch and abrasion resistance, hydrophobicity, antistatic effects.

40|$|In this study, five {{different}} types of maltodextrins (DE- 2, DE- 6, DE- 12, DE- 17 and DE- 19) were characterized for the physico-chemical properties. TGA, DVS and SEC analyses were carried out and additionally apparent melt-viscosity (in a micro-extruder) and the glass transition temperature (analyzed by DMA) of maltodextrin/plasticizer mixtures were also measured in order to evaluate both the effect of plasticizer nature and content {{and the effect of}} the DE-value. For this, three <b>plasticizing</b> <b>agents</b> were compared: water, D-sorbitol and glycerin. The adsorption isotherms showed that depending on the DE-value and the relative humidity they were exposed to, different behavior could be obtained. For example, for relative humidities below 60 % RH maltodextrin DE- 2 was the least hygroscopic. And on the contrary for relative humidities above 75 % RH maltodextrin DE- 2 was the most hygroscopic. The rheology measurements showed that the viscosity decreased with the increase of the DE-value and with the plasticizer content, as expected. On the contrary, no direct correlation could be established between the DE-value and the glass transition temperature. These results demonstrated that to predict maltodextrins behavior and to better adapt the process conditions, combined analyses are mandatory as the DE-value alone is not sufficient. The most compelling evidence was obtained by size exclusion chromatography, which pointed out that maltodextrins had a bimodal molecular weight distribution composed of high and low molecular weight oligo-saccharides. Indeed, maltodextrins are highly polydisperse materials (i. e. polydispersity index ranging from 5 to 12) and that should be the reason why such distinct behaviors were observed in some of the physico-chemical analyses that were preformed...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{the ability}} to foam semi-crystalline natural-based {{polymers}} by supercritical fluid technology is evaluated. The application of this technique to natural polymers has been limited {{due to the fact}} that they are normally semi-crystalline polymers, which do not plasticize in the presence of carbon dioxide. This can be overcome by the use of plasticizers, such as glycerol, which is a commonly used plasticizer, or ionic liquids, which have recently been proposed as <b>plasticizing</b> <b>agents</b> for different polymers. Following the green chemistry principles, the main aim is, hereafter, the design and development of new 3 D architectures of natural-based polymers, combining ionic liquids (IL) and supercritical fluid (SCF) technology. A polymeric blend of starch, one of the most abundantly occurring natural polymers, and poly-ε-caprolactone, a synthetic polymer, which is a biodegradable aliphatic polyester commonly used in an array of biomedical applications (SPCL), was processed by supercritical fluid foaming, at different operating conditions, namely pressure (10. 0 up to 20. 0 MPa), temperature (35 up to 60 °C) and soaking time (30 min up to 3 h). The ionic liquid tested in this work was 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate ([bmim]Ac). The interactions between SPCL and [bmim]Ac or glycerol were analysed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and by mechanical tests, using both tensile and compressive modes. Morphological analysis, porosity, interconnectivity and pore size distribution of the matrixes were evaluated and the morphology was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and by micro-computed tomography. To our knowledge the use of ionic liquids as foaming agents is reported here for the first time. The results obtained suggest that this approach can further promote the development of composite polymer–IL materials, particularly for catalysis, chromatography, extraction and separation purposes.

40|$|Some {{approaches}} {{have been developed}} in our group to investigate the role of ionic liquids as process and property modifiers of natural-based polymers. In our previous work, we proposed the use of ionic liquids as <b>plasticizing</b> <b>agents</b> {{for the creation of}} porous structures from a semi-crystalline natural-based polymer. The current work intended to complement the previous studies, evaluating the ability of ionic liquid (IL) to plasticize blends of starch with poly (lactic) acid, with different ratios of starch and PLA of 50 : 50 and 30 : 70, and its effect on supercritical fluid foaming process (SCF) and providing more insights on the mechanisms involved. For this purpose, SPLA blends were modified and processed using 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([bmim]Cl). Supercritical fluid foaming was studied at different soaking times (1, 3 and 6 h) using carbon dioxide at 20. 0 MPa and 40 oC. The blends were characterized by different techniques, such as infra-red spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and compression and tensile mechanical analysis. The morphology of the foamed structures was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and micro-computed tomography. The results suggest that after 3 h of soaking time an equilibrium state of carbon dioxide into the bulk samples is attained, yielding structures with 6 % and 15 % of porosity, for SPLA 70 and SPLA 50 respectively. The solubility of carbon dioxide withinthe matrices was studied for the same conditions and the results demonstrate a higher sorption degree in the samples doped with ionic liquid. Sorption and desorption diffusion coefficients of supercritical CO 2 in the SPLA matrix were determined for the raw polymer and for the SPLA doped with [bmim]Cl. It was found that the lower desorption diffusion coefficients are related with the higher porosity obtained by the foaming process.

40|$|The {{development}} of new materials for secondary batteries is nowadays {{one of the most}} active fields in the international scientific panorama. The state of the art for liquid electrolytes in a lithium-ion cell is typically a mixture of organic carbonates such as ethylene carbonate (EC) or dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The mixture ratio varies depending upon the desired cell properties. These solvents contain solvated lithium ions. The latter are provided by lithium salts, most commonly lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF 6). Despite the high conductivity of these electrolytes (conucibility > 10 - 3 S•cm- 1 at RT), important drawbacks are associated with the volatility and flammability of liquid solvents and the chemical instability of the LiPF 6 salt. The latter undergoes hydrolysis in the presence of water traces, releasing fluoride anions. Ionic liquids (ILs) are salts with melting temperatures lower than 100 °C. When they are liquid at room temperature, ILs are classified as room temperature ILs (RTILs). Some typical properties of ILs are: a) a low volatility, a high thermal stability and a negligible flammability; b) a high ion density and conductivity; c) a wide electrochemical stability window; and d) a simple synthesis, carried out by choosing the cation and anion which best comply with the requirements of the intended application. These features make ILs very suitable as solvents in electrolytes for Li batteries. Recently, a class of solid-state single-ion conducting materials based on lithiated fluorinated-TiO 2 (LiFT) was proposed, which demonstrated its applicability as a nanofiller to obtain nanocomposite polymer electrolytes. LiFT consists of fluorinated anatase nanoparticles that are directly surface-functionalized with Li through an innovative one-step reaction with molten metallic lithium. The conductivity of LiFT is due to Li hopping processes between coordination sites present at the nanoparticle grain boundaries. These latter events take place in a very effective way. The use of LiFT nanoparticles as the source of Li ions and ILs as the <b>plasticizing</b> <b>agents</b> allowed us to obtain innovative composite electrolytes for application in lithium batteries with a high thermal stability and conductivity. Indeed, the use of imidazolium ILs based on TFSI- and BF 4 - anions allowed us to investigate the different ability of these anions to coordinate and dissociate the Li cations present on the surface of LiFT nanoparticles. For these reasons it has to be highlighted that no conventional Li salts are used in the electrolytes here proposed. In this report, composite electrolytes based on LiFT nanopowder, 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMImBF 4) and 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (EMImTFSI) ILs are proposed. In details, LiFT nanopowder is doped with a known amount of both ILs to obtain two types of electrolytes with formula LiFT/EMImTFSI 0. 118 and LiFT/(EMImBF 4) 0. 200. The resulting electrolytes contain around 25 % wt of ILs and show a powder-like consistence. The correlation between structure, thermal properties and conductivity mechanisms of the resulting LiFT/EMImTFSI 0. 118 and LiFT/(EMImBF 4) 0. 200 electrolytes is investigated by a variety of techniques: (a) FT-MIR and FIR at different temperatures; (b) Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC); (c) Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA); and (d) Broadband Electrical Spectroscopy (BES).

These propert ies are uti l ized chiefly when the mater ia l is suspended in a liquid, usual ly water; or as a dried powder or granule. Most industr ia l appl ications involve the swelling property of bentonite to form viscous water suspensions. Depending upon the relative proport ions of clay and water, these mixtures are used as bonding, <b>plasticizing,</b> and suspending <b>agents.</b> Bentonites disperse into colloidal particles and, accordingly, provide large surface areas per uni t weight of clay. This large surface area is a ma jor reason why bentonite funct ions o well in stabil izing emulsions, or as a med ium to carry other chemicals. Bentonites react chemically with many organic mater ia ls to form compounds which are used chiefly as gelling agents in a var iety of organic l iquids. Bentoni tes are selected for each industr ia l need {{on the basis of}} type and quality. This selection is based principal ly on physical properties, and chemistry of the bentonite becomes involved {{only to the extent that}} it influences the physical properties...|$|R
40|$|Environmentally {{friendly}} {{processing of}} materials {{is becoming an}} increasingly important consideration {{in a wide variety}} of emerging technologies. Polymer processing,in particular, has benefited tremendously in this venue from numerous advances achievedusing high-pressure carbon dioxide (CO 2) as a viscosity modifier, <b>plasticizing</b> agent,foaming <b>agent,</b> and reaction medium. Polymer processing in supercritical fluids has been a major interest for a portfolio of materials processing applications including their impregnation into porous matrices. Also, SCF solvents are being examined as a media for polymerization processes, polymer purification and fractionation, and as environmentally preferable solvents for solution coatings. Pressurized CO 2 isinexpensive, sustainable, relatively benign, and versatile due to its gas-like viscosity and liquid-like densities, which can be controllably tuned through appropriate choice of temperature and pressure. Addition of high-pressure CO 2 to polymer systems can have a profound impact on their thermodynamic properties and phase behavior, since the number of interacting species increases due to the high-pressures, so that the compressibility also increases, as well as the plasticity effects. Even then, polymers are only sparingly soluble in CO 2 unless one uses an entrainer or surfactant. An addition of a liquid monomer co-solvent results in greatly enhanced polymer solubility in the supercritical fluid at rather mild conditions of lower temperatures and reduced pressures. The focus of this research is to measure, evaluate and model the phase behavior of the methyl methacrylate-CO 2 and the poly (methyl methacrylate) -CO 2 -methyl methacrylatesystem, where methyl methacrylate plays role of a co-solvent. Cloud-point data are measured in the temperature range of 30 - 80 Ê»C, pressures as high as 300 bar, co-solvent concentrations of 27 and 48. 4 wt% MMA, and varying PMMA concentrations of 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 5, and 2. 5 wt%. Solubility data is reported for these systems. The experimental results are modeled accurately using the Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) for multi component polymer/solvent mixtures. The measured solubility data appears to be significantly different than previously published results by McHugh et al, Fluid Phase Equilibria, 1999. Thorough investigation, re-calibration of the equipment, and repetition of the measurements has proved that the measured data is entirely correct and the reference data is significantly off, which indirectly gives credit to this work and opens room for amendments of those results...|$|R

40|$|Nanocomposites are of {{interest}} for numerous applications such as catalysis, photonic band gap materials, and waveguides. Ionomers and diblock copolymers have previously been used as templates for ordered nanocomposites. However, these processes have been limited to reactions within thin films or coprecipitation methods from solution due to mass transport limitations of ceramic and metallic precursors within the solid templates. This issue has been addressed by fabricating ordered nanocomposites using phase selective deposition of precursors into supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2) swollen polymeric templates. SCCO 2 is an effective <b>plasticizing</b> <b>agent</b> for most polymers and enhances mass transport of the precursors into polymeric templates while preserving the initial template morphology. By proper choice of template material, the precursor can be selectively bound within one phase of the template and reacted to produce the desired material. The resulting composite contains nanoparticles arranged in an ordered morphology dictated by the template over bulk dimensions. Polymer/ceramic and polymer/metal nanocomposites have been successfully synthesized using this technique. ...|$|E
30|$|The result {{showed that}} as the lignin content in the film increased, tensile (TS) and {{bursting}} strength (BS) decreased. TS of the film ranged between 0.28 anbd 1.2  MPa, and the highest value was exhibited for LG-A, while the addition of lignin significantly decreased the TS of the film (Table  1). The highest bursting strength was observed in LG-A, whereas the lowest was observed in LG-D. Acacia lignin incorporation created an apparent plasticizing effect in gelatin film, as assumed from significant decrease in both tensile and bursting strength. It {{has been reported that}} lignin provides miscibility with other polymers and act as a <b>plasticizing</b> <b>agent</b> in blend films, but only when added in moderate concentrations (Nunez-Flores et al. 2013). The decrease in TS and BS in the lignin–gelatin blended film can be associated with high moisture content of LG-D and LG-E and deceptive plasticizing effect of lignin leading to a decrease in intermolecular attraction forces between polymer chains (Cuq et al. 1997).|$|E

Slit die attached to twin screw extruder was used to measure the viscosity of polymer melts plasticized by supercritical CO 2. A gas injection system was devised to accurately meter the supercritical CO 2 into the extruder barrel. Measurements of pressure drop within the die, confirmed the presence of a one phase mixture and a fully developed flow during the measurements. The viscosity measurement of polypropylene was performed at experimental conditions of various tem-peratures, pressures and CO 2 concentrations. We observed that melt viscosity of polymer was dramatically reduced by CO 2 addition...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, a Nonlinear Acoustic Technique (NAT) {{has been}} used to do a {{non-destructive}} quality assurance of plasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) specimens. The response of the specimen to an ultrasonic wave is analyzed in order to characterize its material properties. The analysis focuses on finding out linear and non-linear properties of the propagated ultrasound wave, such as the second order non-linearity parameter (β) and the sound velocity. The outcomes agree well with the actual properties of specimens in terms of: degree of molecular dispersion of <b>plasticizing</b> <b>agent,</b> non-mixed granulates and the volume fraction of air in strands. As conclusion, it was shown that non-linear acoustic method can be used for predicting mechanical properties of extruded plasticized PVCs. Furthermore, acoustic measurements can be used as on-line measurements during the manufacturing process. It will lead to: increased profit, saved time, less energy and lower costs. There are four questions which are base of this thesis: 1. Is it possible to use non-linear acoustic methods to detect non-mixed granulates within strands? If so, what are the limits? 2. Is it possible to evaluate the degree of molecular dispersion of <b>plasticizing</b> <b>agent</b> with non-linear acoustic methods? If so, what are the limits? 3. Is it possible to determine the volume fraction of air in strands with non-linear acoustics methods? 4. If acoustics methods are used for on-line measurements, what are the limitations and how is it possible to automate measurements with respect to the conceptual design of non-linear methods? The three first questions can be shortened in, investigating degree of non-mixed granulates, molecular dispersion and volume of air in extruded PVC materials. To investigate them, the second order non-linearity parameter (β) and velocity of propagated ultrasound wave in material are measured. β parameter which indicates nonlinear behavior of material is used to examine quality of different PVC samples (non-mixed granulates and molecular dispersion), with respect to each other. Moreover, sound velocity is used to compare volume of air in the samples. Attenuation measurement is also done to find out any correlation between attenuation (linear acoustic property) and β parameter (nonlinear acoustic property). Finally it is concluded that measurement plan which is used in laboratory-experiments also can be utilized in on-line measurement in production line...|$|E
