This is despite the fact that historical base metal smelting slags contain elevated levels of heavy metals and metalloids and are subject to contemporaneous weathering processes thereby releasing elements to ground and surface waters.

40|$|Slag dumps {{occur at}} several {{historical}} smelting sites in north Queensland, Australia. The microcrystalline slags contain <b>primary</b> <b>slag</b> phases, relict flux, ore and furnace materials and secondary weathering related minerals. Common <b>primary</b> <b>slag</b> phases are glass, Zn-rich fayalite (± Zn-rich kirschsteinite) and Zn-rich hedenbergite. Other minor minerals include wollastonite, Zn-rich melilite, Zn-rich iscorite (Fe 7 SiO 10), magnetite {{as well as}} a number of sulphides (pyrrhotite, galena, bornite, sphalerite, wurtzite), metallic phases (Ag, Cu, Pb, Sb), alloys (Cu 3 Sn), and unknown metal compounds. The slag materials contain wt. % concentrations of Zn and elevated levels of Ag, As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, Sb and W. Glass, hedenbergite and fayalite/kirschsteinite are the main repositories of Zn, whereas much of the Cu and Pb is hosted by glass, sulphides, Cu 3 Sn alloys, metallic Cu and Pb, and unknown CuSb, AsSnPb and FeAsCu compounds. The slags are undergoing contemporaneous reaction with air and rainwater. The weathering results in the release of metals and metalloids from <b>primary</b> <b>slag</b> phases, particularly from glass, and the partial immobilization of these metals in secondary soluble and insoluble minerals in the slag heaps. Zinc exhibits pronounced chemical mobility and reports together with elevated Ca and sulphate into surface seepages (up to 10. 2 mg 1 - 1 Zn at pH 6. 97). The slag dumps represent long-term sources of metal pollutants, particularly of Zn, to local ground and surface waters...|$|E
40|$|The <b>primary</b> <b>slag</b> {{generated}} in the cohesive zone of the blast furnace determines the fuel rate {{as well as the}} quality of the hot metal in terms of its silicon content. This is because in the cohesive zone the softened slag chokes the path of gas flow, interfering with the permeability of the bed. Therefore, the cohesive zone which starts with the softening of the <b>primary</b> <b>slag</b> and ends with its flow should be formed lower down the furnace and should be a narrow one with a minimum difference between the flow temperature and the softening temperature. In the present work pellets with C/S ratio ranging from 1. 8 to 2. 4 with a fixed MgO content of 10 % are reduced in the laboratory at different temperature ranging from 1200 C – 1400 C. Synthetic slags prepared in the laboratory in line with the comparison of reduced pellets are analyzed for its flow characteristics using the heating microscope (German Standard 51730). It is observed that under the composition examined, the pellet with C/S ratio 2. 0 rendered the best result with the highest softening temperature and lowest flow temperature...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} tin slags from archaeological {{contexts in}} the south‐west of England {{dating from the}} Early Bronze Age to the nineteenth century. It also includes slags resulting from a recent experimental smelting programme. Analyses show {{that there has been}} little change in composition over this period and that most <b>primary</b> tin <b>slags</b> contain from 10 – 30 per cent stannous oxide in the glass phase, with tin metal prills more common in the early and medieval slags. The principal impurities in the metal are iron and antimony, with smaller amounts of tungsten and arsenic.

40|$|<b>Primary</b> {{smelting}} <b>slags,</b> {{known as}} Lead Blast Furnace (LBF) and Imperial Smelting Furnace (ISF), were {{generated by the}} former pyrometallurgical industries located in Noyelles-Godault, Northern France. Following its closure in 2003, 4 million tons of <b>primary</b> <b>slags</b> have been landfilled as a heap {{in the vicinity of}} the Deûle River, near the industrial basin of Nord-Pas-de-Calais. These slag materials are often enriched in particular metals (Pb, Zn) that can be released into the environment through alteration processes and leaching. Many biological and chemical processes might take place within these tailings and thus affect significantly the slag weathering. Predicting the environmental impact of these wastes requires an understanding of the mineral-water interactions as well as the influence of the biological activities (the involvement of microorganisms). Thus, this research is designed to simulate the natural weathering of slag by simulating different weathering conditions with or without the involvement of the microorganisms as well as by varying several chemical parameters. Chemical weathering of both LBF and ISF slags was studied by as a function of pHs (4, 5. 5, 7, 8. 5 and 10) as well as under two atmospheres (open air and nitrogen). Significant amounts of Ca, Fe and Zn were released under acidic conditions (pH 4) with a decrease towards the neutral to alkaline conditions (pH 7 and 10) for both slags. The concentrations of all elements increased gradually after 216 h compared to initial 24 h of leaching period. The presence of oxygen under open-air atmosphere not only enhanced oxidative weathering but also encouraged formation of secondary oxide and carbonate phases. In addition, Zn dissolution was related to extremes zinc isotopic signatures in the leachate; heavier δ 66 Zn values at low pH than at high pH for both slags under open-air atmosphere. On the other hand, bioweathering of both slags was studied in the presence of a pure heterotrophic bacterial strain (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in a bioreactor operated in batch conditon as well as in a semi-flow through reactor with intermittent leachate renewal conditions. P. aeruginosa is shown to play a significant role in slags weathering by enhancing the leaching and solubility of Zn and Pb. In addition, the cumulative bulk release of dissolved Fe, Si, Ca and Mg doubled in the presence of bacteria, probably due to the release of soluble complexing organic molecules (e. g. siderophores). Bacterial biomass served as the bioadsorbent for Pb, Fe and Zn as 70 - 80 % of Pb and Fe, 40 - 60 % of Zn released are attached to and immobilized by the bacterial biomass. Oxides, hydroxides and carbonates were predicted as secondary phases during chemical weathering of slags whereas carbonates and phosphates were dominant phases during bioweathering. These predictions were in agreement with the observations by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDS), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis, and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysisLe crassier du site MetalEurop (Noyelles-Godault) a accueilli des scories de première fusion entre les années 1936 à 2003.

40|$|The {{effect of}} BO on {{reduction}} of FeO from iron saturated FeO-CaO-SiO-MgO-AlO-TiO slags by graphite {{has been studied}} under static conditions between 1473 and 1573 K. The compositions of quenched samples were determined by electron probe X-ray analysis (EPMA). The reduction degree (R) of FeO in each sample was obtained by mass balance and compared with the reduction of FeO in the slags without BO. The results showed that FeO reduction in the <b>primary</b> <b>slag</b> was effectively improved with only 1 mass-% BO content, but did not continue to increase {{with the increase in}} BO content and it reduced slightly at about 3 mass-%BO. After reduction BO gathered in the liquid phase where it can restrain the formation of iron-titanium oxide and promote the reduction of FeO, so benefiting blast furnace operation...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to the chemistry, the degree of reduction of the iron bearing materials in the burden affects the characteristic temperature of the resulting <b>primary</b> <b>slag</b> in the cohesive zone of the Blast Furnace. Thus the location and extent of the cohesive zone which acts as a gas-distributor in the blast furnace are both influenced by the degree of reduction the iron bearing material undergo prior to their entry into the cohesive zone travelling through the granular zone. The present work is involved with sintering the iron-bearing materials, namely fluxed pellets and raw ore, to different degree of reduction and determination of the characteristic of these pre-reduced materials. The softening temperature of the fluxed pellet increases {{with the increase of}} the degree of reduction up to 65 % and then shows a reverse trend. In case of raw-ore the corresponding value is recorded to be 70 %. Thus the cohesive zone supposed to be lowered with the increase in reduction of the fluxed-pellets, up to 65 % reduction and similar trend is observed up to 70 % for raw-ores. Due to certain experimental ambiguity the flow characteristic the flow-temperature, the softening-flow interval and thus the extent of the cohesive zone, {{as a function of the}} reduction of the iron bearing materials, is so difficult to be as curtained very accurately and only a likely trend has been reported...|$|E

Technical data generated during production and testing of the products will be used to assess the overall technical viability of expanded slag production. In addition, a market assessment will be made based on an evaluation of both the expanded slag aggregates and the final products, and market prices for these products will be established in order to assess the economic viability of these utilization technologies. Relevant cost data for physical and pyroprocessing of slag to produce expanded slag aggregates will be gathered for comparison with (1) the management and disposal costs for slag or similar wastes and (2) production costs for conventional materials which the slag aggregates would replace.

40|$|International audienceLead {{blast furnace}} (LBF), {{one of the}} {{processes}} used in non-ferrous metallurgy, generates huge amounts of <b>primary</b> smelting <b>slags</b> which are often directly landfilled. The slags sampled from the industrial basin of Nord-Pas-de-Calais (northern France) still contain significant quantities of lead and zinc and are exposed to weathering conditions at their disposal site. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate metal leachability when LBF slags come into contact with ultrapure water, sterile growth media or growth media inoculated with a heterotrophic bacterium (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The changes in the surface morphology of slag prior and after the alteration experiments as well as the formation of secondary mineral phases has been monitored by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDX). P. aeruginosa was shown to play a significant role in LBF slags weathering by enhancing the leaching and solubility of toxic elements (Zn and Pb) present in LBF slags. Sorption of Zn and Pb onto bacterial cells and complexation of these toxic metals by siderophores is expected to dramatically enhance the solubility, and therefore the mobility of these metals. Leached out elements were further complexed either with phosphate present in the growth medium or with carbonate which led to the formation of secondary Zn or Pb precipitate...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} slags can be {{formed in the}} lower part of the {{ironmaking}} blast furnace that play important roles in smooth furnace operation, and in determining iron quality and productivity. The final slag tapped from the BF has been investigated extensively as it can be collected directly. Unfortunately, difficulties in accessing the interiors of the blast furnace limit the full understanding of other <b>slags</b> such as <b>primary</b> and bosh <b>slags.</b> In this study, different types of samples directly obtained from the tuyere zone of the blast furnace have been systematically analyzed and characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPMA), and X-ray fluorescence (XRF), with focus on the characteristics of slags formed in the tuyere level. The samples were identified into three groups according to their morphological, mineralogical, and chemical properties: (1) tuyere slags originating from the reactions between ash and dripping slags; (2) bosh slags in the CaO-SiO-AlO-MgO-FeO system, with a CaO/SiO weight ratio of around 1. 50, and AlO and MgO concentrations close to those of final slags; and (3) coke ash that did not react with bosh slags. These findings will provide useful information on the evaluation of slags inside the blast furnace and the reactions in the tuyere zone...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the state of}} slags recycling in foreign countries was carried out. A modern principle was put forward in the article: blast furnace is an apparatus for manufacturing of two basic types of products : cast iron and slag. Granulation, as the <b>primary</b> recycling of <b>slag</b> melt fixes the structure with certain properties at rapid cooling. An {{analysis of}} the existing methods of granulation was carried out and factors influencing the quality of granular slag were determined, as well as the ways of obtaining granular slag with the required physical and mechanical characteristics. The main factors of granulated slags quality, employed for manufacturing of binding materials are chemical composition and the structure of fine granulated particles. All wet methods of granulation are characterized by high humidity of granulated slag, its value reaching 24, 5 %, due to increase in granules’ porosity. Real options for reducing humidity of granulated slag may include: development of the process of granulation, ensuring manufacturing of products with increased density and low content of fine fractions, dehydration of slag in high bunkers and stacks at sufficient soaking time and slag blowdown with a stream moving downwards. Using mechanical granulators and gaseous energy carriers (air) for melt’s dispersion is an efficient way of reducing water consumption for granulation (semi-dry or dry methods of granulation). It also makes it possible to reduce r consumption of water, supplied for granulation from 3, 0 to 0, 7 - 1, 5 m 3 /min. Application of air blast for melt’s dispersion influences its fractional composition and grain shape in the slag: the content of the fraction less than 1, 25 mm reduces to 49, 1 %, as compared to conventional 92, 8 %. The content of spherical grains is with tough surface is 33 %, it promoting reduction of residual humidity of granulated slag. Thus, application of air blast for granulation of slags is an efficient way of obtaining high quality granulated sla...|$|R

40|$|Alkalinity {{generation}} and toxic trace metal (such as vanadium) leaching from BOF steel slag particles must be properly understood and managed by pre-conditioning if beneficial reuse of slag {{is to be}} maximised. Water leaching under aerated conditions was investigated using fresh BOF slag at three different particle sizes (0. 5 - 1. 0 mm, 2 - 5 mm and 10 x 10 x 20 mm blocks) and a 6 month pre-weathered block. There were several distinct leaching stages observed over time associated with different phases controlling the solution chemistry: (1) free lime (CaO) dissolution (days 0 - 2); (2) dicalcium silicate (Ca 2 SiO 4) dissolution (days 2 - 14); and (3) Ca-Si-H and CaCO 3 formation and subsequent dissolution (days 14 - 73). Experiments with the smallest size fraction resulted in the highest Ca, Si, and V concentrations, highlighting the role of surface area in controlling initial leaching. After ~ 2 weeks the solution Ca/Si ratio (0. 7 - 0. 9) evolved to equal those found within a Ca-Si-H phase that replaced dicalcium silicate and free lime phases in a 30 - 150 µm altered surface region. V release was a two stage process; initially V was released by dicalcium silicate dissolution, but V also isomorphically substituted for Si into the neo-formed Ca-Si-H in the alteration zone. Therefore, on longer timescales the release of V to solution was primarily controlled by considerably slower Ca-Si-H dissolution rates, which decreased the rate of V release by an order of magnitude. Overall {{the results indicate that}} the BOF slag leaching mechanism evolves from a situation initially dominated by rapid hydration and dissolution of primary dicalcium silicate / free lime phases, to a slow diffusion limited process controlled by the solubility of secondary Ca-Si-H and CaCO 3 phases that replace and cover more reactive <b>primary</b> <b>slag</b> phases at particle surfaces...|$|E
