500|$|General Prem Chand was {{particularly}} anxious about Bunche's visit. Keenly aware of this, Bunche {{did his best}} to alleviate the general's worries, asking to stay at his residence in Élisabethville instead of a hotel. Prem Chand was alarmed when Bunche presented him with a letter from Thant, but Bunche reached into his <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> a suggested response. The general was surprised by the accuracy of the draft in its considerations of the military situation of UN troops during the advance, though the following day he gave Bunche a full explanation of what had occurred. In his official report on the events in Katanga, Bunche concluded, [...] "I have found beyond doubt that it is our machinery that is at fault, far more than the individuals." [...] He returned to UN Headquarters on 10 January with an official apology from ONUC commanders. Thant later commented on the matter, writing, [...] "I felt that it was I, not they, who should have apologised for my miscalculation and apprehensions based on scare reports from London and Brussels." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{town meeting}} {{attracted}} a packed crowd of over a thousand, with Nixon supporters distributing anti-Voorhis literature at the door. The Senate proxies spoke first for their candidates, followed by Voorhis. Nixon, who had notified organizers {{that he would}} be late due to another commitment, arrived during Voorhis's speech, and remained backstage until the congressman had completed his talk. He then came onstage, shook hands with Voorhis, and delivered a fifteen-minute address. A question-and-answer period then followed, with a Nixon supporter asking Voorhis about his onetime Socialist registration, and about his views on monetary policy. [...] After the representative responded, a Voorhis supporter asked Nixon why he was making [...] "false charges" [...] about the supposed Voorhis CIO-PAC endorsement. [...] In response, Nixon reached into his <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> a copy of a Southern California NCPAC bulletin mentioning the group's endorsement of Voorhis. [...] The congressman was unaware of the endorsement; those of his aides in the know had [...] "completely forgotten" [...] to tell him. [...] Nixon walked halfway across the stage and displayed it to Voorhis, asking him to read it for himself. Voorhis came from his seat and took it, and (according to Bullock, who served as timekeeper at the debate) [...] "mumbled" [...] that this seemed to be a different organization from the CIO-PAC. [...] Nixon reclaimed the document, and began to read out names {{of the members of the}} boards of directors of the two groups, [...] "It's the same thing, virtually, when they have the same directors." [...] The crowd began to cheer Nixon, who later wrote, [...] "I could tell by the audience reaction that I had made my point", and to jeer Voorhis, who wrote, [...] "They'd boo and laugh at my remarks, and this disturbed me." ...|$|E

50|$|As {{the police}} {{show up to}} clear up the mess Barry has created he sits forlornly on a park bench. Disillusioned with the police he throws his badge away before rifling through his <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> a pin, a police radio and a grenade. Realising too late that the pin was {{actually}} from the grenade and it goes off, ending the film.|$|R

60|$|I {{searched the}} <b>pocket</b> again, <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> a ring. Evidently he had thrust these two things {{there when he}} saw me {{pursuing}} him, and had forgotten or neglected them {{in the heat of the}} mêlée.|$|R
60|$|Chief Inspector Heat {{suddenly}} <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> a pink newspaper he {{had bought}} less than half-an-hour ago. He was interested in horses. Forced by his calling into an attitude of doubt and suspicion towards his fellow-citizens, Chief Inspector Heat relieved the instinct of credulity implanted in the human breast by putting unbounded faith in the sporting prophets of that particular evening publication. Dropping the extra special on to the counter, he plunged his hand again into his <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> the piece of cloth fate had presented him with out of a heap of things {{that seemed to have}} been collected in shambles and rag shops, he offered it to Mrs Verloc for inspection.|$|R
60|$|Mose {{thrust his}} hand into his <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> all his money, a handful of small change. His face grew bitter, his last dollar was broken into bits.|$|E

6000|$|... "After {{a little}} while she comes back, and says, 'I've done it, Peck! She's mighty close, and as proud as Lucifer; but she's only a dressmaker, for all that.' 'A dressmaker!' says I; 'how {{did you find out}} she was a dressmaker?' 'Why, I looked at her forefinger, in course,' says Peggy, 'and saw the pricks of the needle on it, and soon made her talk a bit after that. She knows fancy-work and cuttin' out--would ye ever have thought it? And I'll show her how to give the workhouse the go-by to-morrow, if she only holds out, and keeps in her senses. Stop where you are, Peck! I'm going to make Jubber put his dirty hand into his <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> some money; <b>and</b> that's a sight worth stoppin' to see any day in the week.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Agga-Groo {{looked at}} the compass with {{interest}} and tested its power of pointing north. Then {{he shook his head}} and handed it back to Cap'n Bill. The sailor dived into his <b>pocket</b> again <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> a pair of scissors, which he placed beside the compass on the palm of his big hand. [...] "You may have them both," [...] he said.|$|R
5000|$|The {{video for}} the song opens with a man {{standing}} in front of a jukebox, his face unseen by the camera. He scrolls his finger up a list of songs and stops at [...] "Any Way You Want It". He then reaches into his <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> a coin which he inserts into the jukebox. He then selects the song and we see a record being flipped over and beginning to spin. This dissolves into a shot of a studio tape spinning which leads to the group performing the song in the studio. The band's performance comprises most of the video until the song ends. At this point the man at the jukebox is revealed to actually be lead singer Steve Perry who turns and smiles at the camera. Another video exists which is a live performance during the Departure Tour. Both videos were omitted from the band's Greatest Hits 1978-1997 DVD in favor of another live version of the song from the Escape Tour.|$|R
60|$|And he put {{his hand}} into his <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> some silver. Then he made signs of {{mounting}} one of the mules, and waved his hand over the surrounding country to signify that he wanted a general ride.|$|E
6000|$|A flush darkened {{his face}} beneath its cosmetics, {{and with an}} oath he dipped finger and thumb into his {{waistcoat}} <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> a dog whistle. [...] "No more of that," [...] said he, [...] "or I whistle up the police this minute." ...|$|E
60|$|Alice had no {{idea what}} to do, and in despair she put her hand in her <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece all round.|$|E
60|$|Morning, noon, {{and night}} the visitor is perpetually putting {{his hand into}} his side <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> coppers. He drips coppers all day in an unending stream. You enter a French theatre. You buy a programme, fifty centimes, and ten more {{to the man who}} sells it. You hand your coat and cane to an aged harpy, who presides over what is called the vestiaire, pay her twenty-five centimes and give her ten. You are shown to your seat by another old fairy in dingy black (she has a French name, but I forget it) and give her twenty centimes. Just think of the silly {{business}} of it. Your ticket, if it is a good seat in a good theatre, has cost you about three dollars and a half. One would almost think the theatre could afford to throw in eight cents worth of harpies for the sake of international good will.|$|R

50|$|A woman {{goes into}} Grand Central Terminal and runs {{into a black}} man {{standing}} in the middle of the floor. He attempts to help her pick up her belongings, and she protests. This interaction makes her miss her train, and when she leaves the station she can not find her wallet. She makes her way to a cafeteria and takes a salad, and pays for it while informing the waiter that she may not have enough money. After she sits down, she realizes that she has no cutlery, and returns to the service counter for a fork. When she comes back, she finds an African American man who appears to be homeless sitting down and eating a salad. She sits down and informs the man that that is her salad. He ignores her at first then laughs at her continued protests. She then attempts to take the salad away from him, at which point he slams his fist on the table and yells, frightening her. She watches him eat for several moments, not sure what else to do. Finally, the woman grabs her fork and snatches a piece of salad off of the plate. The man does not stop her, and she does it again and again. The man begins to mimic the way she eats and together they finish the salad. Afterwards, the man gets up and returns with two cups (assumed to be tea or coffee), and offers her sugar, which she declines. He then reaches into his <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> a packet, which she accepts, opens, and puts in her drink. She brings the cup up to her mouth, but then puts it down and leaves the restaurant.|$|R
60|$|Slow and ox-like, on {{the face}} of the Swede dawned relief and comprehension. The pang over, the finger felt better. The pain was gone. He {{examined}} the finger curiously, with wondering eyes, slowly crooking it back and forth. He reached into his <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> a gold-sack.|$|E
6000|$|I beckoned to Crowded Owl, and he {{immediately}} {{ran up to}} the wall, and said [...] "How?" [...] in an uncertain tone, {{as if he was}} not sure how we should take it. However, Corny offered him her hand, and Rectus and I followed suit. After this, he put his hand into his <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> three sea-beans.|$|E
6000|$|Denis nodded. Mr. Barbecue-Smith put {{his hand}} in his <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> a notebook.

Here they are." [...] He cleared his throat and read: ...|$|E
6000|$|Another Portuguese, by {{profession}} a soldier, called Jerome Fernandez de Mendoza, {{received a}} considerable assistance from Xavier, {{in a different}} manner, but full as marvellous. Fernandez, having put off from the coast of Coromandel, in a ship belonging to him, wherein was all his wealth, {{to go to another}} coast more westward, was taken near the cape of Comorin, by the Malabar pirates, equally covetous and cruel. To save his life, in losing his goods, he threw himself into the sea, and was happy enough, in spite of his ill fortune, to swim to land, on the coast of Meliapor. Meeting there Father Francis, he related his misfortune to him, and begged an alms. The father was almost sorry, at that time, for his being so poor himself, that he had not wherewithal to relieve the miserable man; yet he put his hand into his pocket, as if he were searching there for something, but finding nothing, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and afterwards turning to Fernandez, with looks full of compassion, [...] "have courage, brother," [...] said he to him, [...] "heaven will provide for you." [...] After which, walking forward four or five paces, he once more put his hands into his <b>pockets,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> fifty pieces of gold: [...] "receive," [...] added he, [...] "what heaven sends you; make use of it, but speak not of it." [...] The surprise and joy of Fernandez were so great, that it was impossible for him to keep silence. He published, in all places, the bounty of his benefactor; and the pieces of gold were found to be so pure and fine, that it was not doubted but they were miraculous.|$|R
5000|$|While Bugs strums {{a guitar}} and composes a calypso ballad (six {{years before the}} style was popularized by [...] "The Banana Boat Song"), Playboy is forced to build a dugout boat. As Bugs is playing, Humphrey Bogart, {{straight}} out of the film The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, appears and asks him if he can [...] "help out a fellow American who's down on his luck". Bugs reaches into his <b>pocket,</b> digs around, <b>and</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> a coin <b>and</b> flips it at him and tells him to [...] "hit the road".|$|R
5000|$|Los Angeles, California. Luther and {{the gang}} drive in the van as the rain {{continues}} to fall. They pass around “a bottle Juarez {{might as well have}} <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> of his back pocket” with no label. Tweetie, who’s driving, is the only one to turn it away. Luther notices how everybody has stopped picking on Hopi. When they arrive at their destination, they search the area and see that nobody’s around. Hopi asks Piña in a whisper if this is when he’s going to get jumped into the gang. Piña shushes him. The crew notices big holes in the ground that have filled with water. Juarez pushes Hopi into one of them. Luther gets on the ground and reaches in. At first he can’t find Hopi anywhere, but finally grabs him by a handful of hair and yanks him out. Hopi asks Luther when he’ll have tattoos like Luther’s. Victor says he can start getting them after he’s jumped in. Luther asks what he keeps a blue pencil for. “Ink scares me.” Luther asks what he uses it for. He says he uses it to write stuff when he gets befuddled. Juarez says he’s a cop. Piña brushes him off. Hopi tells them that he enjoys writing, but Luther feels like there’s more to it. Earlier in the day they’d pulled over for a visit with an old pimp named Nacho Mirande. One of the girls in his building recognized Hopi and ran out into the rain to give him a huge hug. Back in the van, Luther asks Hopi how he knows the girl. Hopi says he's [...] "gotta put that blue pencil to use somehow.” By the holes, Luther slaps Hopi three times. Hopi takes the hits. He thanks Luther when a fourth doesn’t come. “Is that it?” Hopi asks. “Am I in?” Luther says he isn’t, then starts punching him hard, splitting his lip. Hopi falls to the ground and stays face-down. Juarez kicks Hopi twice. He rears back to do a running kick but slips and falls, Piña laughs. Juarez reaches into his back <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> nunchucks. Tweetie grabs Hopi by the hair <b>and</b> <b>pulls</b> him to his knees. Juarez smacks a nunchuck against his knee and howls in pain. Hopi again asks if he’s in. Tweetie <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> a gun. When Hopi sees the gun pointed at him, it dawns on him that this isn’t an initiation. He begs Piña to intercede. She turns away. He begins to sob. Luther rips off Hopi’s necklace and tosses it to Piña. He orders Juarez to get Hopi out of his jacket <b>and</b> empty his <b>pockets.</b> When he does, he finds the blue pencil and a grilled cheese sandwich from earlier wrapped in tinfoil. Hopi says it was for his mother. Hopi begs Luther to let him live. Luther grabs him by the neck and drags him to the edge of one of the holes. Luther then walks around {{to the other side of}} the hole. Tweetie, Juarez, Piña, and Victor form a wall behind Hopi. Luther orders Hopi to stand up. He complies. Luther peels off his shirt to reveal his tattoos, scars, and bullet wounds. He holds his arms out wide, then “steps forward and walks on water.” ...|$|R
