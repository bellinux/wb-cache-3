However, the long-lever pistol grip was best appraised in the usability assessment. Fifty-one {{percent of the respondents}} do sometimes control a scissors handle by means of a so-called <b>palm</b> <b>grip,</b> which approaches the hand posture when controlling a pistol grip. Moreover, our results emphasize that discomfort as a result of contact pressure is frequently experienced in the thumb and thenar area. Based on the indicated use of instruments, we concluded that this pressure-induced discomfort is a result from the use of scissors handles. Additionally, two recent studies also reported clinical support for a pistol-grip handle design. A pistol grip would specifically meet the need to alleviate contact stress during instrument control [28, 29]. In summary, these results suggest that a haptic feedback grasper is best equipped with a pistol grip.|$|E

Vinte e cinco voluntários (11 pianistas e 14 não pianistas) realizaram 4 tipos de tarefas com a mão direta: Preensão grossa em velocidade rápida (T 1); Preensão grossa em velocidade lenta (T 2); Preensão em gancho em velocidade rápida (T 3) e Preensão em gancho em velocidade lenta (T 4). No dorso da mão foram colocados 16 marcadores nas extremidades proximais e distais dos ossos metacarpianos e falanges proximais do 2 ° ao 5 ° dedos. Para a captura das imagens foram utilizadas quatro câmeras de vídeo digital, conectadas a quatro microcomputadores. A medição das coordenadas e a reconstrução {{tridimensional}} dos marcadores foram realizadas através do sistema ?Dvideow ? Digital Vídeo for Biomechanics?, desenvolvido no Laboratório de Instrumentação para Biomecânica da Faculdade de Educação Física da UNICAMP. Os ângulos de flexão e extensão das articulações metacarpofalangeanas foram calculados a partir da medida das coordenadas dos marcadores. Foram utilizados diagramas de fase para caracterização do padrão e da regularidade das repetições. A Análise por Componentes Principais foi utilizada para quantificar o padrão e a regularidade dos ciclos de movimento e a correlação entre as curvas dos ângulos das articulações dedos foi utilizada para avaliar sinergia dos dedos durante a tarefa. A partir dos resultados, foram observados que as diferenças mais evidentes entre os grupos controle e pianista foram identificadas na regularidade da curva para tarefa T 2, através da Análise por Componentes Principais e para todas as tarefas na análise da correlação entre os ângulos das articulações metacarpofalangeanas. Na comparação entre as tarefas foram encontradas diferenças significativas entre as realizadas com a preensão grossa e gancho, em todas as análises. Através da metodologia empregada e das análises foi possível caracterizar os padrões de preensão palmar de pianistas e evidenciar diferenças entre pianistas e não pianistasThis work {{describes an}} experimental study that aimed to quantitatively analyze the <b>palmer</b> <b>gripping</b> patterns of pianists during {{the execution of}} function tasks relating to gripping and speed of execution. Twenty-five subjects (11 pianists and 14 non-pianists) carried out 4 tasks with their right hand: Gross gripping at fast speed (T 1); Gross gripping at low speed (T 2); Hook gripping at fast speed (T 3); Hook gripping at low speed (T 4). Sixteen markers were put on the dorsal surface of the hand, on the proximal and distal extremities of the metacarpian bones and proximal phalanges of the 2 nd and 5 th fingers. Four digital video cameras connected to two microcomputers were used to capture the images. The measurement of the coordinates and the three-dimensional reconstruction of the markers were carried out through the ?Dvideow ?Digital Video for Biomechanics? system, developed at the Instrumentation Laboratory for Biomechanics at the Physical Training College at UNICAMP. The flexion and extension angles of the metacarpophalangeal articulations were calculated from the measurement of the marker coordinates. The phase diagram movement cycles were {{used to analyze the}} alteration in the <b>palmer</b> <b>gripping</b> patterns in pianists. The Principal Components Analysis was used to quantify the movement patterns and the regularity of the the phase diagram movement cycles which were built from the position and angular speed curves; the correlation between the angle curves of finger joints was used to evaluate the finger synergy during the task. With these results as a starting point, it was possible to observe that the most evident differences between the control and pianist groups were identified in the regularity of the curve for the second task (T 2) through the Principal Components Analysis, and for all the tasks, in the analysis of the correlation between the angles of the metacarpophalangeal joints. In the comparison between the tasks, a difference was observed among those carried out in gross and hook gripping in all the analysis.

RESULTS: The patients with COPD had lower values for the free-fat mass (FFM) index (18 ± 1 versus 21 ± 1 kg/m², p< 0. 05), maximum load attained in the CET (60 ± 20 versus 102 ± 18 watts, p< 0. 01), MIP (58 ± 19 versus 87 ± 21 cmH 2 O, p< 0. 05), <b>palm</b> <b>grip</b> strength (38 ± 6 versus 47 ± 5 kg, p< 0. 05), peak torque (103 ± 21 versus 138 ± 18 Nm, p< 0. 05) and total work of the quadriceps femoris (1570 ± 395 versus 2333 ± 568 J, p< 0. 05) when compared with the control group (independent Student’s t test). There was no correlation between FEV 1 and the variables studied, while the FFM correlated with the total work of the quadriceps (Pearson, r= 0. 6290, p< 0. 05).

Patients with primary osteoarthrosis of the trapezium-metacarpal joint, in stages II, III and IV of the Eaton classification, with persistent pain that was refractory to clinical treatment, were included. For the functional assessment, the visual analogue scale, DASH questionnaire and Buck-Gramcko score were used.

40|$|A {{conceptual}} model was proposed {{to describe the}} overall relationship among hand postures, motions, forces, factors, memory, and feedback. Second, logistic regression models were developed based on a study of 10 male and 10 female subjects that showed relative hand load greater than 34 % of maximal strength motivated subjects to reach and grasp cylinders using underhand posture (rather than overhand), and relative hand load as low as 24 % motivated subjects to hold the objects (for about 8 s) using <b>palm</b> <b>grip</b> at shoulder height (vs. hook grip at mid-thigh height). The relative hand load threshold increased to 53 % for selecting underhand over overhand posture for placing the objects. Third, a study of relative finger loads for 6 male and 6 female subjects lifting cylinders showed that selection of hand posture {{is related to the}} preference of reducing thumb and fingertip forces and joint loads. Subjects demonstrated strong preferences of underhand over overhand grasp, and hook grip over pinch to lift cylinders, while thumb tip and sum of fingertip forces can be reduced up to 60 % by selecting the preferred postures. Biomechanical models predicted overhand thumb and finger normal forces similar to data if friction was considered, while predicting about 2 times of measured normal forces if friction force was assumed zero. Fourth, finger force distribution and placement were determined for 6 males and 6 females holding unbalanced plate objects. The thumb and finger center-of-force (CoF) locations were generally aligned with the load moment arm. The distance between thumb and finger CoF locations increased by 39 % as load moment increased from 0. 98 Nm to 2. 35 Nm, and reduced by 17 % as hand length increased from 16. 2 cm to 21. 1 cm when the plate was held horizontally. Previous studies showed that posture selection is related to effort (Rosenbaum et al. 2006). This work shows that effort can be described quantitatively by relative joint loads, and that posture predictions based on biomechanical analysis of relative finger forces and joint loads account for 45 %- 87 % of variance. The unexplained variance may be due to mechanical inter dependencies among finger motions and finger force measurement errors...|$|E

Three prediction models (for shooting score, shooting precision and shooting trueness) are established by using a Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM), Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM); the results of present study indicate that the model developed by using an LS-SVM exhibits excellent prediction ability. The force of the shooters right index finger abdomen for pulling the pistol trigger and {{the force of the}} shooters left <b>palm</b> for <b>gripping</b> the pistol significantly influence shooting performance. An inexperienced shooter can use {{the results of this study}} as a reference for improving his or her shooting skills. Furthermore, this study will greatly assist efforts to upgrade pistol design and performance...|$|R
3000|$|Challenging tasks with {{gloved hands}} include a {{majority}} of essential movements requiring hand motions such as using a walkie-talkie, carrying, holding and using tools or hoses etc. In particular, holding a hose (approximately 45  kg of pressure at the tip) with gloved hands is very challenging due to poor <b>grip</b> in the <b>palm</b> and fingers. A male firefighter elucidated the situation as such: “There’s almost no <b>grip</b> on my <b>palm</b> right now. Even though it’s resting on my <b>palm,</b> all the <b>grip</b> is in the fingers. I can’t grip the hose with my gloves. I grip it with my body and my arm. If I try to hold it just with my glove, it will slide (Site # 6).” [...]...|$|R
5000|$|On a hip {{throw off}} the right hip (for example), the most common way this throw is taught is to grab the uke's right arm with the left hand. Some styles, however, teach [...] "wrapping" [...] the uke's right arm with the left instead of the grab. Biomechanically, the most {{effective}} method is to grab the right upper arm using a monkey style grip. Using this method, one grips the opponent's left arm using the 4 fingers and the thumb against the <b>palm,</b> (instead of <b>gripping</b> with the thumb against the 4 fingers). The reason for using this grip rather than a normal human gripping action is that the thumb gripping against the 4 fingers is weaker in strength than the grip applied by the 4 fingers and thumb against the palm (as monkeys do when gripping the branch of a tree to swing). Grabbing the upper arm rather than the wrist allows the body greater pulling torque.|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar prospectivamente os resultados de uma série de pacientes submetidos ao tratamento cirúrgico da rizartrose, com a técnica de ressecção do trapézio associada à interposição de um novelo do tendão abdutor longo do polegar. MÉTODOS: De maio a agosto de 2005, 10 pacientes foram submetidos ao tratamento cirúrgico da rizartrose. Foram incluídos pacientes com osteoartrose primária da articulação trapézio-metacárpica, estágios II, III, IV da classificação de Eaton, com dor persistente refratária ao tratamento clínico. Para avaliação funcional foi utilizada a escala visual analógica, questionário DASH e o escore de Buck-Gramcko. Na avaliação global do paciente foram mensuradas as forças de preensão palmar, pinça polpa a polpa, pinça lateral, pinça de três pontos, oponência e abduções radial e palmar. Realizou-se, ainda, o índice de migração do primeiro {{metacarpal}} na radiografia de repouso e sob estresse. RESULTADOS: Foram considerados bons, no alívio da dor (p = 0, 005), com melhora da função na avaliação pelo DASH módulos 2 (p = 0, 02) e 3 (p = 0, 022) O escore de Buck-Gramcko apresentou um resultado excelente e três ótimos. Houve melhora em quase toda avaliação global, sendo não significante apenas na pinça lateral e abdução. Em todos pacientes houve migração do primeiro metacarpal. CONCLUSÃO: A trapeziectomia associada à interposição de um novelo do tendão abdutor longo do polegar mostrou-se uma técnica de execução relativamente simples e eficaz no alívio da dor e na melhora funcional. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively {{evaluate the}} results {{from a series of}} patients who underwent surgical treatment for rhizarthrosis using the technique of trapezium resection associated with interposition of yarn from the long abductor tendon of the thumb. METHODS: From May to August 2005, ten patients underwent surgical treatment for rhizarthrosis. Patients with primary osteoarthrosis of the trapezium-metacarpal joint, in stages II, III and IV of the Eaton classification, with persistent pain that was refractory to clinical treatment, were included. For the functional assessment, the visual analogue scale, DASH questionnaire and Buck-Gramcko score were used. For the overall assessment on the patients, strength measurements were made for <b>palm</b> <b>grip,</b> pulp to pulp pinch, lateral pinch, three-point pinch, opposition and radial and palmar abductions. The migration index for the first metacarpal was also determined on radiographs at rest and under stress. RESULTS: The pain relief was considered to be good (p = 0. 005), with functional improvements in modules 2 (p = 0. 02) and 3 (p = 0. 022) of DASH. The Buck-Gramcko score showed one excellent and three very good results. There was an improvement in almost all of the overall assessment and was only non-significant regarding lateral pinch and abduction. For all patients, there was migration of the first metacarpal. CONCLUSION: Trapeziectomy associated with interposition of yarn from the long abductor tendon of the thumb was shown to be a relatively simple and effective technique for pain relief and functional improvement...|$|E
60|$|I laid my <b>palm</b> {{upon the}} <b>grip</b> of my pistol and {{answered}} that I could. He saw the move, {{glanced at the}} butt of the automatic where it protruded from its holster, and smiled. Then he turned and raising his great bow, fitted an arrow and drew the shaft far back. His warriors, supercilious smiles upon their faces, stood silently watching him. His bow was the longest and the heaviest among them all. A mighty man indeed must he be to bend it; yet Al-tan drew the shaft back until the stone point touched his left forefinger, and he did it with consummate ease. Then he raised the shaft to the level of his right eye, held it there for an instant and released it. When the arrow stopped, half its length protruded from the opposite side of a six-inch tree fifty feet away. Al-tan and his warriors turned toward me with expressions of immense satisfaction upon their faces, and then, apparently for Ajor's benefit, the chieftain swaggered to and fro a couple of times, swinging his great arms and his bulky shoulders {{for all the world like}} a drunken prize-fighter at a beach dancehall.|$|R
5000|$|Pressured {{by dozens}} of imitations and the {{proliferation}} of blatant unlicensed copies, FN began work in earnest on a successor product to the Model 1908 Vest Pocket pistol. The basic Vest Pocket pistol design was used {{as a starting point for}} the new design. Dieudonné Saive (who would later design the Browning Hi-Power pistol and FN FAL rifle) was asked during 1926-1927 to design the new pistol. His design was smaller, lighter, and incorporated several refinements and improvements to the M1908 version. For example, the hand <b>palm</b> activated <b>grip</b> safety mechanism was eliminated and the small safety lever on the left side of the receiver was extended under the grip so that the thumb of a right-handed shooter could easily engage and disengage it using pressure applied to the side of the safety lever - rather than pushing it down into the receiver- without having to release one's grip on the pistol. This improvement was at the cost of the slide hold-back feature that was eliminated in the new design. The receiver has a full-length dust guard extending to the end of the slide and an area behind the trigger is relieved to allow a user to maintain a more substantial grip on the pistol. The Dieudonne Saive design also introduced a magazine safety mechanism similar to the one utilized on the Colt Vest Pocket pistol. Parts are not interchangeable between these pistols. [...] A cocking indicator was also incorporated on the back of the slide. This model was marketed under the name [...] "Baby" [...] - and some of the original thermal hardened plastic grips were molded with both the initials [...] "FN" [...] at the top of the grip in a circle and the word [...] "BABY" [...] at the bottom of the grip under a raised crescent. This particular pistol was and continues to be known worldwide as the [...] "Baby Browning" [...] pistol and is the pistol reflected in the picture accompanying this article, excepting the BROWNING marked grip which indicates a more recent (circa 1960 and beyond) production run utilizing nylon impregnated polymer grips.|$|R
40|$|Grip lock {{was first}} {{described}} in the medical literature by Samuelson et al 11 and is known to most male gymnasts, athletic trainers, and coaches. Over a 10 -year period, the researchers reported that 38 % of responding college coaches had a gymnast who sustained a grip lock injury and that 84 % of coaches were aware of a gymnast who had sustained a grip lock injury. 11 The grip used in men’s gymnastics for the high bar is a leather dowel that wraps around the wrist and middle 3 fingers (Figure 1). When the injury occurs, the leather dowel becomes locked around the high bar while the gymnast’s momentum continues to carry his body through the element. The leather of the grip at the fingertips becomes caught around the bar near the <b>palm</b> as the <b>grip</b> tightens and locks (Figure 2). The bone and/or soft tissues of the forearm, wrist, and hand fail as the torque increases. CASE REPORT OF GYMNAST A A 20 -year-old right-hand-dominant male Division I college gymnast sustained a grip lock injury while preparing to dismount the high bar. As he used an overgrip position (ie, holding the bar with the palm facing away), his right dowel grip locked. A teammate supported him by providing counterweight while the injured athlete unwrapped his locked grip. Twenty-four hours later, the athlete {{was brought to the}} orthopaedic clinic with superficial palm abrasions, large ecchymoses, and edema dorsally over the wrist. Physical examination revealed an extension lag of his index finger at the metacarpophalangeal joint of 60 °. Pain was reproducible with gentle, passive flexion of the fingers along the dorsal forearm. Radiographs demonstrated an ulnar styloid avulsion fracture, and a fluoroscopic exam showed a minimal increas...|$|R
