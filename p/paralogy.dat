(Furthermore, much later molecular phylogenetics has shown that vertebrates are {{more closely related to}} tunicates than to amphioxus, thus negating the logic of this analysis.) The 2R hypothesis saw a resurgence of interest in the 1990s for two reasons.

40|$|Abstract. In {{comparing}} genomic maps, we try {{to distinguish}} mapping errors and incorrectly resolved <b>paralogies</b> from genuine rearrangements of the genomes. This can be formulated as a Maximum Weight Independent Set (MWIS) search, where vertices are potential strips of markers syntenic on both genomes, and edges join conflicting strips, in order to extract the subset of compatible strips that accounts for the largest proportion of the data. This technique is computationally hard. We introduce biologically meaningful constraints on the strips, {{reducing the number of}} vertices for the MWIS analysis and provoking a decomposition of the graph into more tractable components. New improvements to existing MWIS al-gorithms greatly improve running time, especially when the strip conflicts define an interval graph structure. A validation of solutions through genome rearrange-ment analysis enables us to identify the most realistic solution. We apply this to the comparison of the rice and sorghum genomes. ...|$|R

For instance, if the coding of {{presence or absence of}} genes in complete genomes gives interesting results, it {{does not take into account}} the phylogenetic information contained in sequences and ignores hidden <b>paralogies</b> by using a BLAST reciprocal best hit definition of orthology. In addition, concatenation of sequences of different genes as well as building of consensus trees only consider the few genes that are shared among all organisms. Here we present an attempt to use a supertree method to build the phylogenetic tree of 45 organisms, with special focus on bacterial phylogeny. This led us to perform a phylogenetic study of congruence of tree topologies, which allows the identification of a core of genes supporting similar species phylogeny. We then used this core of genes to infer a tree. This phylogeny presents several differences with the rRNA phylogeny, notably for the position of hyperthermophilic bacteria...|$|R

Despite their utility and ubiquity, the morphological and metabolic distinctiveness of the complex's members, and thus their taxonomy, is poorly defined. We are using short read pyrosequencing technology (Roche/ 454 and Illumina/Solexa) to rapidly scale up genomic and transcriptomic analysis of this species complex. To date we predict 11197 genes in Aspergillus niger, 11624 genes in A. carbonarius, and 10845 genes in A. aculeatus.

To most effectively deploy these very large numbers of ESTs we developed 2 novel methods for clustering the ESTs into assemblies.

Hughes and colleagues found that phylogenetic trees built from different gene families within <b>paralogy</b> regions had different shapes, suggesting that the gene families had different evolutionary histories. This was suggested to be inconsistent with the 2R hypothesis. However, other researchers have argued that such 'topology tests' do not test 2R rigorously, because recombination could have occurred between the closely related chromosomes generated by polyploidy, because inappropriate genes had been compared and because different predictions are made if genome duplication occurred through hybridisation between species. In addition, several researchers were able to date duplications of gene families within <b>paralogy</b> regions consistently to the early evolution of vertebrates, after divergence from amphioxus, consistent with the 2R hypothesis. When complete genome sequences became available for vertebrates, Ciona intestinalis and amphioxus, it was found that much of the human genome was arranged in <b>paralogy</b> regions that could be traced to large-scale duplications, and that these duplications occurred after vertebrates had diverged from tunicates [...] and amphioxus.|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} objective for inferring {{the evolutionary}} history of gene families is {{the determination of}} orthologies and <b>paralogies.</b> Lineage-specific paralog loss following whole-genome duplication events can cause anciently related homologs to appear in some assays as orthologs. Conserved synteny—the tendency of neighboring genes to retain their relative positions and orders on chromosomes over evolutionary time—can help resolve such errors. Several previous studies examined genome-wide syntenic conservation to infer the contents of ancestral chromosomes and provided insights into the architecture of ancestral genomes, but did not provide methods or tools applicable {{to the study of}} the evolution of individual gene families. We developed an automated system to identify conserved syntenic regions in a primary genome using as outgroup a genome that diverged from the investigated lineage before a whole-genome duplication event. The product of this automated analysis, the Synteny Database, allows a user to examine fully or partially assembled genomes. The Synteny Database is optimized for the investigation of individual gene families in multiple lineages and can detect chromosomal inversions and translocations as well as ohnologs (paralogs derived by whole-genome duplication) gone missing. To demonstrate the utility of the system, we present a case study of gene family evolution, investigating the ARNTL gene family in the genomes of Ciona intestinalis, amphioxus, zebrafish, and human.

Previous genome-scale approaches to predicting these relationships have been limited by their use of protein similarity and their failure {{to take into account}} multiple splicing events and gene prediction errors. We have developed PhyOP, a new phylogenetic orthology prediction pipeline based on synonymous rate estimates, which accurately predicts orthology and <b>paralogy</b> relationships for transcripts, genes, exons, or genomic segments between closely related genomes. We were able to identify orthologue relationships to human genes for 93 % of all dog genes from Ensembl. Among 1 : 1 orthologues, the alignments covered a median of 97. 4 % of protein sequences, and 92 % of orthologues shared essentially identical gene structures. PhyOP accurately recapitulated genomic maps of conserved synteny. Benchmarking against predictions from Ensembl and Inparanoid showed that PhyOP is more accurate, especially in its {{predictions of}} <b>paralogy.</b> Nearly half (46 %) of PhyOP <b>paralogy</b> predictions are unique. Using PhyOP to investigate orthologues and paralogues in the human and dog genomes, we found that the human assembly contains 3 -fold more gene duplications than the dog. Species-specific duplicate genes, or "in-paralogues," are generally shorter and have fewer exons than 1 : 1 orthologues, which is consistent with selective constraints and mutation biases based on the sizes of duplicated genes. In-paralogues have experienced elevated amino acid and synonymous nucleotide substitution rates. Duplicates possess similar biological functions for either the dog or human lineages. Having accounted for 2, 954 likely pseudogenes and gene fragments, and after separating 346 erroneously merged genes, we estimated that the human genome encodes a minimum of 19, 700 protein-coding genes, similar to the gene count of nematode worms. PhyOP is a fast and robust approach to orthology prediction that will be applicable to whole genomes from multiple closely related species. PhyOP will be particularly useful in predicting orthology for mammalian genomes that have been incompletely sequenced, and for large families of rapidly duplicating genes. © 2006 Goodstadt and Ponting...|$|E

Analogous reconstructions show significantly lower levels of <b>paralogy</b> in prokaryotes, 1. 19 for archaea and 1. 25 for bacteria. The only functional class of eukaryotic proteins with a significant excess of paralogous clusters over the mean includes molecular chaperones and proteins with related functions. Almost all genes in this category underwent multiple duplications during early eukaryotic evolution. In structural terms, the most prominent sets of paralogs are superstructure-forming proteins with repetitive domains, such as WD- 40 and TPR. In addition to the true ancestral paralogs which evolved via duplication at the onset of eukaryotic evolution, numerous pseudoparalogs were detected, i. e. homologous genes that apparently were acquired by early eukaryotes via different routes, including horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from diverse bacteria. The results of this study demonstrate a major increase in the level of gene <b>paralogy</b> as a hallmark of the early evolution of eukaryotes...|$|E

Such trees, constructed from DNA sequences variation at individual genetic loci, are mainly used to infer phylogenies of the taxa that bear these genes. However, {{because of the}} presence of <b>paralogy,</b> lineage sorting, and horizontal transfer, gene trees and species trees are often inconsistent (see [1] for example) and so a program that sequence...|$|E
40|$|Aromatic {{amino acid}} hydroxylase (AAAH) genes and insulin-like genes {{form part of}} an {{extensive}} <b>paralogy</b> region shared by human chromosomes 11 and 12, thought to have arisen by tetraploidy in early vertebrate evolution. Cloning of a complementary DNA (cDNA) for an amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae) hydroxylase gene (AmphiPAH) allowed us to investigate the ancestry of the human chromosome 11 / 12 <b>paralogy</b> region. Molecular phylogenetic evidence reveals that AmphiPAH is orthologous to vertebrate phenylalanine (PAH) genes; {{the implication is that}} all three vertebrate AAAH genes arose early in metazoan evolution, predating vertebrates. In contrast, our phylogenetic analysis of amphioxus and vertebrate insulin-related gene sequences is consistent with duplication of these genes during early chordate ancestry. The conclusion is that two tightly linked gene families on human chromosomes 11 and 12 were not duplicated coincidentally. We rationalize this paradox by invoking gene loss in the AAAH gene family and conclude that paralogous genes shared by paralogous chromosomes need not have identical evolutionary histories...|$|E
