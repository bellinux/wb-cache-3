25|$|The {{issue of}} the {{theological}} structure and composition of the Sermon on the Mount remains unresolved. One group of theologians ranging from Saint Augustine in the 5th century to Michael Goulder in the 20th century, see the Beatitudes as the central element of the Sermon. Others such as Bornkamm see the Sermon arranged around the Lord's prayer, while Daniel <b>Patte,</b> closely followed by Ulrich Luz, see a chiastic structure in the sermon. Dale Allison and Glen Stassen have proposed a structure based on triads. Jack Kingsbury and Hans Dieter Betz see the sermon as composed of theological themes, e.g. righteousness or way of life.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tail of the}} hood, {{often quite}} long, was called the tippit or liripipe in English, and liripipe or cornette in French. [...] The cape element was a <b>patte</b> in French and in English cape, or {{sometimes}} cockscomb when fancily cut. [...] Later a round bourrelet (or rondel) could form part of the assemblage. <b>Patte,</b> cornette and bourrelet were the usual terms in the French of the 15th century Burgundian court, and are used here. [...] In Italian the equivalent terms were foggia, becchetto, and mazzocchio.|$|E

2500|$|E) the <b>patte</b> {{could be}} worn to the rear, loose or {{tucked into the}} other clothes {{at the back of}} the neck, whilst the cornette was wrapped round over the top of the head and under the chin a couple of times and secured.

2500|$|A padded [...] {{circular}} bourrelet (or rondel) evolved, which {{sat around}} the head, whilst the cornette became much longer, and gradually more scarf-like in shape, until by the 1430s it was usually straight at the sides and square-ended.

2500|$|The only {{surviving}} manuscript miniature by Rogier van der Weyden shows Philip the Good {{wearing a}} chaperon in style B. Next to him stands Chancellor Nicolas Rolin, using a less exuberant version of style B; only he has sufficient status to wear his chaperon indoors in the Duke's presence. Apart from the Bishop of Tournai, next to Rolin, {{all the other}} men are bare-headed, even Philip's young heir, {{despite the fact that}} several of them are high-ranking intimates who, like the Duke, wear the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece. But as far as can be seen, all have hats. [...] The man in grey seems to be carrying another sort of hat, but all the other ones visible are chaperons worn in style F, mostly with the cornettes to the front. The young Charles the Bold has his <b>patte</b> wrapped round the back of his neck, and the man on the extreme right has his bourrelet further than usual down his back, with the <b>patte</b> hanging down from it. Most of the chaperons are black, although the man in blue has one in salmon-pink; black was having one of its earliest periods of being the most fashionable colour at the time.|$|E
2500|$|F) {{when the}} {{chaperon}} {{needed to be}} removed, in warm weather, or {{in the presence of}} a person much higher in rank (and, usually, in church) it could be put over the shoulder with the <b>patte</b> and cornette hanging on opposite sides, or round the shoulders. [...] Which came forward and which went back varies considerably, but more often the bourrelet went behind. [...] Possibly the chaperon was secured to the shoulder, as the assemblage often looks rather precarious. [...] Donor figures in religious paintings always wear their chaperons in this way, as they are figuratively in the presence of the saints or the Madonna.|$|E
2500|$|Maria Rasputin (baptized as Matryona Grigorievna Rasputina) (26 March 1898 [...] 27 September 1977) was the {{daughter}} of Grigori Rasputin and his wife Praskovia Fyodorovna Dubrovina. She wrote two memoirs about her father, dealing with Tsar Nicholas II and Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna, the attack by Khionia Guseva and the murder. A third one, The Man Behind the Myth, was published in 1977 in association with <b>Patte</b> Barham. In her three memoirs, the veracity of which has been questioned, she painted an almost saintly picture of her father, insisting that most of the negative stories were based on slander and the misinterpretation of facts by his enemies.|$|E

Les <b>Pattes</b> de mouche (1860, afterwards anglicized as A Scrap of Paper) obtained a similar success at the Gymnase.|$|R
5000|$|Corridor of Mirrors is a 1948 British drama film {{directed}} by Terence Young and starring Eric Portman, Edana Romney and Barbara Mullen. It {{was based on}} a novel by Christopher Massie. It is notable as being both Terence Young's and Christopher Lee's first film. Visually one of the most engaging pieces of cinema made in Britain in 1948, Corridor of Mirrors extends the French post-war aesthetic typical of Jean Cocteau's 1950 film Orphée (Orpheus) and Jean Gremillion's noirish <b>Pattes</b> Blanches (White Paws, 1949), another neo-realist fairy story.|$|R
