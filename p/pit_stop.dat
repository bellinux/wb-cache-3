5|$|Michael Schumacher lapped {{consistently}} in the 1:26 range, {{setting the}} new fastest lap {{of the race}} on lap 22, a 1:26.428, to extend his lead over Häkkinen to 5.4 seconds, who in turn was 9.9 seconds in front of Zonta. Verstappen in fourth was a further 2.9 seconds behind, but was drawing ahead of Ralf Schumacher in fifth. On lap 23, Zonta became the first front runner to make a scheduled <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> and emerged in eleventh position. Salo continued {{to move up the}} field when he passed Wurz for sixth on lap 25. Three laps later, Zonta moved into ninth position after he overtook Mazzacane and Diniz. Salo made a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> for the second time on lap 29 and emerged in tenth place. Verstappen took his <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> three laps later and came out in seventh position. Zonta made his third and final <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> of the race on lap 36 and dropped to eighth position. Michael Schumacher took his <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 39 and rejoined 13.6 seconds behind Häkkinen, who now led the race. Three laps later, Häkkinen made a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> and rejoined behind Michael Schumacher with a deficit on eleven seconds. Fisichella was the final driver to make a scheduled stop on lap 44. Fisichella's <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> was problematic: he stalled when he encountered a problem with his clutch system and his mechanics push-started his Benetton and he rejoined in eleventh.|$|E
5|$|Alesi, {{the first}} front-runner {{to make a}} {{scheduled}} <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 18, rejoined in tenth. During the next two laps Salo passed Irvine for twelfth, whilst Barrichello made a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> from sixth position and came out in eleventh. By lap 22, Michael Schumacher had increased his lead over Häkkinen to eleven seconds. Ralf Schumacher, ten seconds behind Häkkinen, maintained a six-second gap over teammate Button. Michael Schumacher made a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on that lap, emerging in third position. On lap 23 Barrichello passed Herbert for ninth position, and {{during the next two}} laps Villeneuve and Ralf Schumacher made pit stops. Button made a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> from fourth position on lap 26, and Häkkinen one lap later; Häkkinen was told by his team (on pit boards) to speed up to reduce the gap to Michael Schumacher, who had a heavier fuel load. Button dropped to eighth position, and Häkkinen came out behind Michael Schumacher. Frentzen and Coulthard made their pit stops together on lap 28, with Coulthard emerging ahead of Frentzen. On that lap, Barrichello passed Alesi for sixth position. Barrichello, setting the fastest lap of the race (1:53.803 on lap 30), had consecutive fastest laps before making his second <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 31. However, his car's fuel pressure dropped and he was pushed by marshals into the pit lane. Barrichello and Alesi (who had a similar problem) retired, and Button inherited fourth place. Salo was the final scheduled driver to make a <b>pit</b> <b>stop,</b> on lap 33.|$|E
5|$|Gutiérrez lost ninth {{position}} on lap 30 {{when he was}} passed by Kvyat, who drove through standing water {{on the inside of}} the pit lane straight and used DRS. Vettel made his second <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> for intermediate tyres that lap, rejoining in fifth behind Ricciardo but ahead of both Williams cars. Button recorded faster lap times than Rosberg, closing the gap to 12.8 seconds by the beginning of lap 31. Pérez overtook Gutiérrez to take over tenth {{position on}} the lap. Button made a second <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> for new intermediate tyres at the end of lap 31; it took longer than expected because his pit crew changed his steering wheel, and he came out behind both Red Bull drivers. Vettel recorded a new fastest lap of the race at one minute and 51.915 seconds, 2.3 seconds quicker than Hamilton; Rosberg made his second <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> (for new intermediate tyres) on lap 33, and came out behind Ricciardo. Magnussen experienced understeer and spun 360 degrees after running onto the run-off area. Hamilton made a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> at the end of lap 35 for new intermediate tyres. Heavy rain began to fall on lap 36. Ricciardo took the lead until his <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> during that lap and came out behind the two Mercedes drivers, Vettel and Button.|$|E
50|$|Split screens are {{frequently}} used in motor racing, especially during safety car <b>pit</b> <b>stops</b> in the IndyCar Series and NASCAR, where four way splits are used, most often with three leading cars or trucks' <b>pit</b> <b>stops</b> {{shown on the}} left and a shot of the pit exit (where restart order is determined after <b>pit</b> <b>stops)</b> on the right, with some featuring just four different cars or trucks making <b>pit</b> <b>stops.</b> Often these <b>pit</b> <b>stops</b> can change the entire outcome of a race. In sports, an instant replay, highlights package, or featurette on a specific subject relating to the play may be shown in a corner while the main play is happening.|$|R
50|$|The No Bull Sprint was {{eliminated}} after 2002, and for 2003, The Winston Open {{would become a}} 20-lap race with <b>pit</b> <b>stops,</b> and then a 10 green flag lap sprint after <b>pit</b> <b>stops.</b>|$|R
50|$|Weather {{played a}} {{critical}} role in Tiny Lund winning this race; with temperatures reaching up to 75 F and wind speeds up to 20 mph. Lund won by making only four <b>pit</b> <b>stops,</b> but he would not have been able to make the distance on four <b>pit</b> <b>stops</b> had the first ten laps not been run under caution to dry the track from earlier rains. Had the race not started under caution, Lund would have had to make five <b>pit</b> <b>stops,</b> just as Fred Lorenzen and Ned Jarrett did. He was able to win on four <b>pit</b> <b>stops</b> along because of the slow start time.|$|R
5|$|Häkkinen passed Villeneuve on lap 28 {{although}} {{he went off}} the track in the process. Herbert made his only <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on the same lap {{although he}} stalled and rejoined in twelfth place. Gené, Mazzacane, Ralf Schumacher and Verstappen made pit stops between laps 28 and 29. Villeneuve tried to retake fourth position from Häkkinen on the 30th lap but overshot the manoeuvre. Häkkinen made a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 35, emerging behind Villeneuve and Irvine. Coulthard managed to close to within 2 seconds of Michael Schumacher {{when he made his}} second <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 38. Michael Schumacher made a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on the following lap and remained in the lead. Barrichello became the leader for one lap and made his <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 41. This allowed Michael Schumacher to reclaim the first position. By the start of lap 45, Coulthard had closed to within two seconds of Michael Schumacher. Ralf Schumacher was called into his garage by his team to retire on the 45th lap. Zonta pulled off the race track with an blown engine two laps later.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher {{began to}} pull away from Häkkinen. de la Rosa ran into the rear of Alesi at Wurth corner on lap two causing Alesi to retire, with de la Rosa {{sustaining}} a broken front wing and retired after going off at Campsa corner. Further back, Irvine passed Verstappen for twelfth position. The positions at the front were the same for the next sixteen laps with the gap between Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen fluctated from 1.6 seconds to 3.4 seconds while Coulthard and Barrichello battled Ralf Schumacher for third position. Button became the first driver to make a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 18 and rejoined in front of Mazzacane. Villeneuve made his <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on the 21st lap, which promoted Frentzen into the points-scoring positions. After rejoining the circuit, his car caught fire and he pulled {{off to the side of}} the track at the exit of Seat corner. Trulli's <b>pit</b> <b>stop,</b> which dropped him to 17th, proved problematic: he stalled his engine which required his mechanics to restart it. Ralf Schumacher made a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> one lap later and re-emerged in fifth. On lap 24, Michael Schumacher made his <b>pit</b> <b>stop.</b> As he accelerated from his pit box, his rear wheel hit the Ferrari refuller Nigel Stepney who was dragged before being knocked over. Stepney was taken to the circuit's medical center for observation and he was replaced by reserve refuller Andrea Vacari. Coulthard made a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on the same lap and experienced problems with leaving his pit box because he selected second gear and re-emerged behind Ralf Schumacher.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher {{started from}} the pole {{position}} and held off a challenge from Häkkinen {{on the first}} lap. He maintained the lead until his first <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 24 when a refuller was struck by his rear tyre, allowing Häkkinen {{to take over the}} lead until his <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> two laps later. Michael Schumacher kept the lead for a further twenty-one laps as he and Häkkinen made their second pit stops together, with Häkkinen emerging in front because Schumacher experienced a slow <b>pit</b> <b>stop.</b> Häkkinen kept the lead for the remaining twenty-three laps to win the race.|$|E
50|$|The {{regulations}} {{stipulate that}} no single driver drive over two-thirds of the race distance, which affects the timing of <b>pit</b> <b>stops</b> and driver changes, therefore preventing strategy from dominating the competition. Formerly, the regulations went further and required <b>pit</b> <b>stops</b> and driver changes be done within mandatory windows; in 2004, during the Fontana exhibition race, a few teams were penalised after the race ended when race officials discovered their <b>pit</b> <b>stops</b> came one lap before the mandatory window had opened.|$|R
25|$|Green flag <b>pit</b> <b>stops</b> {{began on}} lap 242 and Menard {{was the first}} to pit under green. Thirteen laps later, Matt Kenseth passed Keselowski to claim the lead. When green flag <b>pit</b> <b>stops</b> were over, Keselowski {{reclaimed}} the lead. On lap 340, the third caution waved when David Stremme made contact with the wall. During the caution, all of the leaders made <b>pit</b> <b>stops.</b> Keselowski led the field back up to speed at the restart. On lap 348, Kenseth took the lead from Keselowski. Eleven laps later, the fourth caution came out when Gordon and Earnhardt made contact on the backstretch, causing Gordon to suffer a flat left rear tire and spin sideways. None of the leaders made <b>pit</b> <b>stops</b> during the caution.|$|R
50|$|The {{frequency}} of <b>pit</b> <b>stops</b> {{depends on a}} large number of factors, such as fuel consumption, fuel tank size, and tyre wear. In endurance events such as Super GT, the <b>pit</b> <b>stops</b> and driver changes during the race are carried out within mandatory windows, which is similar to the two stops that are obligatory under the rules of Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters. Since the 2007 Formula One season, two different tyre compounds must be used during a race, effectively setting the minimum number of <b>pits</b> <b>stops</b> to one.|$|R
5|$|Montoya {{made his}} <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 22. However, his <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> proved problematic: the signal lights at his pit box stopped working, causing the Williams refuller {{to switch to}} the fuel rig for Ralf Schumacher and Montoya {{remained}} stationary for 20 seconds longer than usual. Montoya was also fuelled for longer than his team planned. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead with Michael Schumacher behind him and Montoya re-emerged in fourth place. One lap later, Michael Schumacher took his <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> and he {{came out with a}} fuel pressure problem which meant he pulled {{to the side of the}} main straight and retired. Burti spun off and beached his car in the gravel trap at Nordkurve on the same lap. Ralf Schumacher made his <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 24 and rejoined with a 10-second advantage. Villeneuve, Button and Alonso all followed Ralf Schumacher into the pit lane on the same lap. Alonso encountered a problem when leaving his pit box: the Minardi refuelling valve had a problem, and his car's afterburner remained on, though the flames extinguished themselves when Alonso accelerated out of the pit lane. Montoya pulled over to the side of the track on lap 25, with smoke billowing from his engine, and retired. Fisichella made a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> from fourth on lap 26 and re-emerged in fifth behind Villeneuve. Marques retired from the race with a gearbox problem on the same lap. Coulthard made a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 27 and immediately became the race's next retirement when he acclerated away from his pit box with a blown engine. The resulting event meant he pulled to the side of the circuit. Panis made his <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 31 and came out behind Button and Alesi. Barrichello became the final driver to make a scheduled <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on the 32nd lap.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{elected to}} {{not to make}} a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> and {{maintained}} the lead at the lap-21 restart, ahead of Félix da Costa. Piquet chose to make his <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> immediately after racing resumed. Bird pulled away from Félix da Costa who was being held up by the delayed Vergne. He chose to remain on the circuit with a strategy to conserve his car's electrical energy usage which was being followed by both Jaguar drivers. Bird made his <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> {{at the end of the}} 25th lap and it appeared that he would rejoin the race in the lead but technical problems with his second car caused him to search for different reset proceducres, lose one minute and 27 seconds and rejoin the circuit one lap down in 15th position. An electrical issue was discovered on Evans' second car during his <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> and his team elected to retire him on the same lap to prevent further damage. Frijns led the field for one lap before making his <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on the 26th lap. Buemi took over the first position from Frijns with di Grassi in second place and Heidfeld third. Di Grassi closed to within less than two seconds behind Buemi with ten laps of the race left with the latter reacting by extending his advantage to 2.5 seconds. Rosenqvist set the race's fastest lap on lap 36, competing a circuit of one minute and 2.947 seconds, which earned him one championship point.|$|E
5|$|Green flag pit stops {{began on}} the 152nd lap; Kenseth made his <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on the same lap. Johnson and Biffle made a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> the next lap, handing the lead to Jeff Gordon. After pit stops, Biffle {{reclaimed}} the first position. On lap 157, Elliott Sadler spun out, causing the second caution. None of the leaders elected to pit under the caution. The race restarted on lap 162 with Biffle in the lead, ahead of Kenseth and Jeff Gordon. By the 190th lap, Biffle's lead was three seconds.|$|E
50|$|One {{additional}} rule {{change for}} 1972 involved the mandatory <b>pit</b> <b>stops.</b> A minimum of four <b>pit</b> <b>stops</b> (fuel hookup required) {{was required for}} 1972. The change was up from two <b>pit</b> <b>stops</b> in 1965-1967, and up from three in 1968-1971. Individual tire changes were still optional, but the rapidly increasing speeds from 1972 on would generate greater tire wear. As a result, tire changes became increasingly necessary and more common. Several drivers won the race in the 1960s without changing any tires, but no longer would that be feasible.|$|R

5|$|Hélio Castroneves, the {{defending}} champion of the Indy Japan 300, won the pole position by posting the fastest lap in qualifying. In the race, Wheldon gained the lead from Castroneves on lap 44 and led {{for more than half}} of the 200 laps, but a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> with 14 laps remaining forced him to relinquish the top position. Kanaan took the lead because of a late <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> by Dixon, and held off a late challenge by Wheldon to secure first place.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher started {{alongside}} Coulthard on {{the front}} row of the grid. Going into the first corner, Häkkinen accelerated faster than Michael Schumacher and Coulthard off the line and overtook both drivers for the lead. He managed to maintain his lead until his first <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 31. As his teammate Coulthard made his <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> one lap later, Häkkinen regained the lead which he held to win his third win of the season. Michael Schumacher fended off Coulthard, who challenged him in the later stages despite losing time lapping backmarkers, to take second.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher took {{an early}} <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 34 {{and his team}} {{inspected}} his rear of his car {{as well as an}} adjustment to his front wing angle. He rejoined behind Barrichello, but ahead of Häkkinen who overtook Villeneuve on lap 35. Heidfeld pulled {{off to the side of}} the track with an engine failure on the previous lap after he made a <b>pit</b> <b>stop.</b> Alesi in the other Prost stalled at his <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> and emerged in front of Irvine. Trulli became the first front runner to make a scheduled <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 39. Alesi retired when his engine failed on lap 40. Häkkinen, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Zonta, Coulthard, Villeneuve and Fisichella made their pit stops over the next three laps. Salo pulled into retirement after his engine failed on lap 42. All of the drivers changed from dry to wet-weather tyres as rain began to fall from lap 42 onwards. Häkkinen was the final driver to pit on lap 46. Fisichella lost second position to Barrichello on the 47th lap after running wide.|$|E

5|$|Montoya {{maintained}} his start-line advantage and led {{until he was}} passed by Barrichello on the ninth lap. Barrichello pulled away from Montoya and held the lead until his one and only <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 19 which proved problematic because of a faulty refuelling rig. Montoya was utilising a one-stop strategy and made a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 29, which allowed his teammate Ralf Schumacher to lead for six laps. Barrichello regained the lead on lap 36, until Montoya took over the position on lap 42 when Barrichello made a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> for the second time. Barrichello started to reduce the gap between himself and Montoya {{but was unable to}} challenge the Williams driver who won his first Formula One victory.|$|E
5|$|On lap 28, Kimi Räikkönen was {{the first}} of the top runners to pit, coming out in fourth, but spun at the hairpin in a repeat of an {{incident}} from 2014. The incident cost him twelve seconds and allowed Valtteri Bottas to stay ahead of him in third after he made a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 30. Hamilton made a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on the same lap with Rosberg following suit two laps later, both without incident. At this point, Rosberg was about 1.5 seconds behind his teammate. Another four laps later, Sebastian Vettel came in for his second and final stop of the race. Massa came in for his only stop on lap 38, putting on the super-soft tyres, and dropped from sixth to ninth. Räikkönen made a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> again on lap 42, staying in fourth position ahead of the Lotus of Romain Grosjean.|$|E
5|$|Ralf Schumacher {{took his}} first <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 28, {{emerging}} in seventh position. Barrichello pitted one lap later. Race leader Häkkinen took his <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 31 and came out behind teammate Coulthard. Häkkinen regained the lead after Coulthard made his <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 32, who came out in third position. Fisichella retired with further brake problems on lap 32. Häkkinen set the fastest lap of the race, a 1:20.028 on lap 33, {{as he continued to}} stretch his lead over Michael Schumacher. Coulthard, who was on fresh tyres, gradually began to close the gap to Michael Schumacher by lap 39. Michael Schumacher increased the gap when Coulthard lost two seconds; the result of being held up by Genè who was later issued a 10-second stop-go penalty. Barrichello pitted for the second time on lap 47. Michael Schumacher and Ralf Schumacher made their pit stops on lap 50, one lap ahead of Coulthard.|$|E

Robby Gordon and David Gilliland stayed out while the other teams made <b>pit</b> <b>stops.</b> Gordon and Gilliand made <b>pit</b> <b>stops</b> the next lap and gave the lead to Kurt Busch. Kurt Busch brought the field to the green flag with Hamlin in second, Montoya in third, Johnson in fourth, and Kahne in fifth on lap 51. After Hamlin made a good restart he passed Kurt Busch on lap 52. Afterward, on lap 54, Landon Cassill {{returned}} to the track while J.J. Yeley returned to the garage. Kahne passed Montoya for the third position. After 67 laps, Hamlin had a 2.4second lead over Kurt Busch in the second position. On lap 87, green flag <b>pit</b> <b>stops</b> began. One lap later, most drivers in the first ten positions made <b>pit</b> <b>stops.</b> Denny Hamlin, {{who was in the}} first position, came to pit road on lap 92, but had problems leaving which gave Kurt Busch the lead.|$|R

5|$|Salo and Alesi {{became the}} first drivers to make {{scheduled}} pit stops on lap 16. Coulthard made a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> one lap later to remove the debris from his radiator and rejoined in sixth. Button became the race's fifth retirement because of an engine failure on lap 19. Michael Schumacher continued to set consecutive fastest laps, as he built an 8.8-second gap to Barrichello by his first <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 24. Barrichello took over the lead for one lap before his <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on the following lap handing it back to Michael Schumacher. By the end of lap 26, all of the leading drivers on two-stop strategies had taken their pit stops. The race order was Michael Schumacher, Coulthard, Barrichello, Herbert, Verstappen, Villeneuve, Häkkinen, Wurz, Irvine, Zonta, Fisichella, Salo, Gené, Ralf Schumacher, Mazzacane, Alesi and Trulli.|$|E
5|$|By lap 30, Earnhardt {{had moved}} up eight {{positions}} to twelfth. Ten laps later, Reutimann had maintained a lead of 1.7 seconds over Kenseth. On lap 42, Marcos Ambrose moved into seventh. Five laps later, Kenseth claimed the lead off Reutimann who {{was blocked by}} Casey Mears. On lap 51, green flag pit stops began, as Kenseth made a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> handling the lead to Stewart. On lap 54, Kyle Busch became the new race leader after Stewart came into pit road. Kyle Busch made a <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> one lap later, handing the lead back to Kenseth. By lap 60, Kenseth had built up his lead over Reutimann by over two seconds. Eight laps later, Stewart passed Reutimann for second.|$|E
5|$|Fisichella {{spun off}} from seventh place on lap eight, losing eight {{positions}} and Irvine moved into Fisichella's former position. Alesi pitted on lap ninth and re-emerged {{at the rear}} of the field after repairs to his car's steering. Villeneuve passed de la Rosa for 21st position. Two laps later, Alesi drove to his garage and became the first retirement of the race. Fisichella ran wide on lap 12 and was passed by Herbert for 13th. Three laps later, Fisichella made his first <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> for repairs to his car's brakes and came out in 19th position. Häkkinen's lead over Michael Schumacher was seven seconds by lap 19. Coulthard was a further three seconds behind the Michael Schumacher and was drawing ahead from Ralf Schumacher. Villeneuve moved into 18th position after passing Fisichella and Zonta by lap 20. Heidfeld became the race's second retirement when he stalled after making the first scheduled <b>pit</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 22.
