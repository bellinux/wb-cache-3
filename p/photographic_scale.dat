40|$|This article {{sets out}} to develop a {{critical}} and theoretical interpretation of what scale means in and for photography, an investigation provoked by the expansive character of photography {{in the context of}} networked digital culture that also involves questions relating to historical practices and theorisations of photography. Scale has many different meanings in these contexts and these are normally addressed separately in specialised discursive frameworks. This article explores an alternative, namely, that it is its very diversity which gives the clue to what scale means for photography. The article projects a concept of ‘photographic scale’ to delineate the relational form of scale in photography and argues that <b>photographic</b> <b>scale</b> has ontological significance for photography. This concept denotes a ubiquitous, variegated and compound play between differing but necessarily associated scales that inform the spatiotemporality of photography, that allow for its sense as a form of visual representation, that structure its modes of materialisation and that figure significantly in determinations of its global geo-political processe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Photographic scales {{have become}} an {{increasingly}} used tool in objectively assessing outcomes in aesthetic surgery. However, no online <b>photographic</b> <b>scale</b> for assessing breast ptosis has been developed yet that is readily available. Objectives: This {{study was designed to}} validate the online Rainbow Scale for the assessment of breast ptosis for the anterior-posterior (AP), lateral, and oblique views. Methods: For the five grades of the Rainbow Scale format, standardized reference photographs were selected. Six plastic surgeons rated 15 photographs for each view three times. Intra-and inter-observer agreements were calculated by using the weighted kappa coefficient and differences in intra-and inter-observer agreements between the three views were assessed for statistical significance using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: The mean intra-observer agreements were 0. 91 (range, 0. 82 - 0. 98) for the AP view, 0. 88 (range, 0. 77 - 1. 00) for the oblique view, and 0. 86 (range, 0. 74 - 0. 97) for the lateral view and did not vary significantly between all three views. The mean inter-observer agreements were 0. 88 (range, 0. 77 - 0. 95) for the AP view, 0. 84 (range, 0. 72 - 0. 94) for the oblique view, and 0. 82 (range, 0. 58 - 0. 95) for the lateral view. The mean inter-observer agreements of the AP view varied significantly from the oblique view (P =. 012) and the lateral view (P =. 001).

Objective: Develop a scale for rating lip fullness and establish its reliability and sensitivity for assessing clinically meaningful differences. Methods: The initial Allergan Lip Fullness Scale (iLFS; a four-point <b>photographic</b> <b>scale</b> with verbal descriptions) was validated by eight physicians rating 55 live subjects during two rounds, conducted on one day. In addition, subjects performed self-evaluations. The revised Allergan Lip Fullness Scale (LFS), a five-point scale with {{a broader range}} of lip presentations, was validated by 21 clinicians in two online image rating sessions, ≥ 14 days apart, in which they used the LFS to rate overall, upper, and lower lip fullness of 144 3 -dimensional (3 D) images. Physician inter- and intra-rater agreement, subject intra-rater agreement (iLFS), and subject-physician agreement (iLFS) were evaluated. Additionally, during online rating session 1, raters ranked 38 pairs of 3 D images, taken before and after lip augmentation, as “clinically different ” or “not clinically different. ” The median LFS score difference for clinically different pairs was calculated to determine the clinically meaningful difference. Results: Clinician inter- and intra-rater agreement for the iLFS and LFS was substantial to almost perfect. Subject self-assessments (iLFS) had substantial intra-rater reliability and a high level of agreement with physician assessments. Median LFS score differences for overall, upper, and lower lip fullness were 1 (mean: 0. 63 - 0. 69) for “clinically different ” and 0 (mean: 0. 28 - 0. 36) for “not clinically different ” image pairs; thus, clinical significance of a 1 -point difference in LFS score was established.

40|$|The {{availability}} of high-resolution, multi-temporal, remotely sensed topographic data is revolutionizing geomorphic analysis. Three-dimensional topographic point measurements acquired from structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry {{have been shown}} to be highly accurate and cost-effective compared to laser-based alternatives in some environments. Use of consumer-grade digital cameras to generate terrain models and derivatives is becoming prevalent within the geomorphic community despite the details of these instruments being largely overlooked in current SfM literature. A practical discussion of camera system selection, configuration, and image acquisition is presented. The hypothesis that optimizing source imagery can increase digital terrain model (DTM) accuracy is tested by evaluating accuracies of four SfM datasets conducted over multiple years of a gravel bed river floodplain using independent ground check points with the purpose of comparing morphological sediment budgets computed from SfM- and LiDAR-derived DTMs. Case study results are compared to existing SfM validation studies in an attempt to deconstruct the principle components of an SfM error budget. Greater information capacity of source imagery was found to increase pixel matching quality, which produced eight times greater point density and six times greater accuracy. When propagated through volumetric change analysis, individual DTM accuracy (6 – 37 cm) was sufficient to detect moderate geomorphic change (order 100 000 m 3) on an unvegetated fluvial surface; change detection determined from repeat LiDAR and SfM surveys differed by about 10 %. Simple camera selection criteria increased accuracy by 64 %; configuration settings or image post-processing techniques increased point density by 5 – 25 % and decreased processing time by 10 – 30 %. Regression analysis of 67 reviewed datasets revealed that the best explanatory variable to predict accuracy of SfM data is <b>photographic</b> <b>scale.</b> Despite the prevalent use of object distance ratios to describe scale, nominal ground sample distance is shown to be a superior metric, explaining 68 % of the variability in mean absolute vertical error...|$|E

The investigation was divided in three stages. In the first stage the various phases of leaf development were determined. These were designated as: Infant (V 1), Formation (V 2), Juvenile (V 3) and Mature (V 4). Furthermore a <b>photographic</b> <b>scale</b> represented 12 phases of these foliar development was designed. In the second stage, it was determined that the causal agent of chasparria was Colletotrichum proteae. The fungus was isolated from diseased tissues and inoculations to healthy plants were made. The disease symptoms were reproduced and the same fungus was isolated from infected tissues of all inoculated plants. Furthermore, the symptoms caused by C. proteae under experimental conditions were similar to those observed for chasparria in commercial farms. The disease presented an incubation period (IP) of three to five days on phases V 1, V 2, V 3 and a latent period (LP) of six days; for phase V 4 the IP was seven days and LP nine days. The leaves that were affected with more severity were those of phases V 2 and V 3. In another experiment the sensitivity in vitro of C. proteae to fungicides (protectant and systemic) was tested. Six concentrations of the active ingredient (0. 01, 0, 0. 1, 1, 10, 100 ppm) of each fungicide were tested. The active ingredient were categorized as high sensitivity 50 mgL- 1 (clorotalonil, azoxistrobin, boscalid, mancozeb and mancozeb + oxicloruro de Cobre. Protectant fungicides, metiram, propineb and clorotalonil resulted in a highly percent of inhibition of the mycelial development. Prochloraz, difenoconazole and pyrimethanil were the best of the systemic fungicides tested. During the field trials, two experiments with experimental designs that consisted of five blocks and four treatments were conducted. One of them consisted in the evaluation of the rotation of conventional (T 1) and non-conventional fungicides (T 4) and the addition of acetic acid (50 ml L- 1) (T 2 -T 3). It was determined that the conventional treatment is the best to manage chasparria in field conditions. The acetic acid decreased the severity of the disease in the T 2 and T 3 but increase it in T 1 treatment. In the other field experiment of phase three foliar fertilization using (Ca, Mg and Si as a management strategy for chasparria was tested). Results of this experiment indicate that the treatments did not have an effect in the severity of the symptoms of chasparria. To evaluate the severity of the symptoms in the two field experiments, a scale of 0 - 7 (0 =no symptoms and 7 =severe symptoms) was developed and validated {{at the beginning of the}} experiments.

40|$|Discussed are {{a variety}} of {{remotely}} sensed data sources that may have utility in the identification of conservation practices and related linear features. Test sites were evaluated in Alabama, Kansas, Mississippi, and Oklahoma using one or more of a variety of remotely sensed data sources, including color infrared photography (CIR), LANDSAT Thematic Mapper (TM) data, and aircraft-acquired Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner (TIMS) data. Both visual examination and computer-implemented enhancement procedures were used to identify conservation practices and other linear features. For the Kansas, Mississippi, and Oklahoma test sites, photo interpretations of CIR identified up to 24 of the 109 conservation practices from a matrix derived from the SCS National Handbook of Conservation Practices. The conservation practice matrix was modified to predict the possibility of identifying the 109 practices at various <b>photographic</b> <b>scales</b> based on the observed results as well as photo interpreter experience. Some practices were successfully identified in TM data through visual identification, but a number of existing practices were of such size and shape that the resolution of the TM could not detect them accurately. A series of computer-automated decorrelation and filtering procedures served to enhance the conservation practices in TM data with only fair success. However, features such as field boundaries, roads, water bodies, and the Urban/Ag interface were easily differentiated. Similar enhancement techniques applied to 5 and 10 meter TIMS data proved much more useful in delineating terraces, grass waterways, and drainage ditches as well as the features mentioned above, due partly to improved resolution and partly to thermally influenced moisture conditions. Spatially oriented data such as those derived from remotely sensed data offer some promise in the inventory and monitoring of conservation practices as well as in supplying parameter data for a variety of computer-implemented agricultural models...|$|R

Methods: The {{study was a}} randomized, controlled, open label, intra-patient monocentric study. It consisted of two different phases, the assessment of tolerability phase on 20 healthy volunteers, and {{the evaluation of the}} efficacy on 21 subjects affected by chronic moderate/severe blepharitis; the treatment period was 2 weeks, followed by 1 -week of follow-up. In the efficacy phase, in both eyes, eyelid hygiene was also performed. At day 0, 3, 7, 14, and 21 a complete ophthalmological examination was performed. In the tolerability phase, signs of clinical toxicity were recorded and subject-reported symptoms were collected using a questionnaire. In the efficacy phase, global signs and symptoms of blepharitis scores were collected using standardized <b>photographic</b> <b>scales</b> and questionnaire. The statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results: No ocular signs of drug toxicity were reported. During the treatment period for tolerability phase, there were statistically significant higher scores of tearing and ocular discomfort in the tolerability study group versus the tolerability control group. In the efficacy phase, differences between global scores of the two groups were statistically significant at day 0 (score of the efficacy study group was higher than the efficacy control group; P = 0. 005) and at day 21 (score of the efficacy study group was lower than the efficacy control group (P ≤ 0. 001).

40|$|Background/purpose: Skin properties, such as colour, {{hydration}} and texture, can {{be studied}} on a qualitative basis by a clinical assessment or on a quantitative basis using techniques that measure biophysical properties of the skin. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the links between facial skin features and a range of skin biophysical parameters using multivariate methods. Methods: A study was conducted on 256 female volunteers from Ile-de-France with apparent healthy skin, aged between 20 and 50, under controlled environmental conditions (mean ± standard deviation: room temperature 22. 9 ± 0. 3 °C; relative humidity 48. 5 ± 2. 3 %). The study included a medical questionnaire and a clinical examination of the skin performed by a dermatologist, and a biophysical evaluation of the skin properties. Seventy visual and tactile skin features were assessed on the forehead and the cheek using ordinal variables illustrated by <b>photographic</b> <b>scales.</b> Twenty-eight biophysical measurements were taken in the same areas using the following equipment: Chromameter®, Evaporimeter®, Corneometer®, Skicon®, Sebumeter®, Sebutape®, skin thermometer, skin pH-meter and Silflo®. In order to group the variables illustrating a same unimodal phenomenon, a typology of the skin features and a typology of the biophysical parameters were carried out using a clustering method. Then, the relationships between each group of clinical features and each group of biophysical parameters were studied using a series of partial least squares (PLS) regressions. Results: From eight groups of clinical features and three groups of biophysical parameters that were identified, 12 significant PLS regression models were built. Our findings suggest that differences in chromametric measurements express not only differences in skin colour but also differences in skin surface properties, such as skin vascularity status, thickness, and existence of wrinkles, and also demonstrate that the level of sebum excretion can affect other aspects of the skin surface. Conclusion: Some skin features assessed clinically do not appear to be linked to any biophysical parameter. This finding confirms that certain phenomena evaluated on the basis of visual or tactile skin features are not assessed on the basis of the biophysical properties of the skin measured by our bioengineering techniques. Indeed, visual skin features mainly appreciate the skin surface aspect, contrary to some biophysical surrogate markers known to provide information on underlying epidermal structures. Therefore, both clinical and biophysical assessments must be associated to supply a relevant and accurate approach for skin aspect characterisation. © 2007 Blackwell Munksgaard.

The mediational model was not supported; however, normative beliefs (via the DENS) were significant independent predictors of maladaptive behaviors.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{documented}} moderate-to-large associations between ratings of physical attractiveness and other interpersonal traits, but {{this research has}} invariably relied on within-subjects designs that leave open the possibility of halo effects or response biases. In the present study, 40 men completed the <b>Photographic</b> Figure Rating <b>Scale</b> in a within-subjects design, rating the figures for physical attractiveness, health, and suitability as a long-term partner. In addition, 108 men completed the same scale in a between-subjects design, being randomly allocated {{to one of three}} subgroups where they rated the figures for attractiveness, health, or suitability as a long-term partner. Results indicated no significant differences in ratings for the within-subjects participants. In contrast, there were significant differences in ratings for the between-subjects design. These results highlight the importance of considering halo and response bias effects when designing studies of interpersonal judgements and interpreting their results...|$|R

[...] In 2009 Griffin was invited by Kirsha Kaechele to exhibit the Ladder sculpture at the Voodoo Experience in New Orleans. In 2008 Griffin was invited by Lydia Takeshita of LA Artcore, to show his large <b>scale</b> <b>photographic</b> works in both Thailand and Japan. In 2011 Lydia Takeshita staged a one-man exhibition of Mark's work, entitled: Dream Red Body, at the LA Artcore Union Center for the Arts.
