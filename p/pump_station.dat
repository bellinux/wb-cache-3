5|$|Pumping {{stations}} {{maintain the}} momentum of the oil as it goes through the pipeline. <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 1 is the northernmost of 11 pump stations spread across the length of the pipeline. The original design called for 12 pump stations with 4 pumps each, but <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 11 was never built. Nevertheless, the pump stations retained their intended naming system. Eight stations were operating at startup, and this number increased to 11 by 1980 as throughput rose. As of December 2006, only five stations were operating, with <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 5 held in reserve. Pump Stations 2 and 7 have a capacity of moving 60,000 gallons/minute (227,125 l/min), while all other stations have a capacity of 20,000 gal/min (75,708 l/min). The pumps are natural-gas or liquid-fueled turbines.|$|E

5|$|A leak was {{discovered}} on Jan 8, 2011, {{in the basement}} of the booster pump at <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 1. For more than 80 hours, pipeline flow was reduced to 5 percent of normal. An oil collection system was put in place, and full flow resumed until the pipeline was again shut down while a bypass was installed to avoid the leaking section.|$|E

5|$|At Valdez, {{construction}} was two-thirds complete by September as 4,200 workers hurried {{to complete the}} marine terminal. Because of loose soil found at the job site, enormous retaining walls had to be constructed to secure the ground below some of the 58 structures that were completed {{by the end of}} the year. During the first week of November, the first ship docked at the newly built Valdez quays. It was not a tanker but a ship bringing more construction material. In December, the first signal was sent from the Valdez operations center—where two new control computers had been installed—to <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 2 on the North Slope.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1975, Alyeska {{terminated}} Ketchbaw's {{contract and}} took responsibility for analyzing weld X-Rays itself. The controversy continued, however, as Kelley's lawsuit moved forward, a Ketchbaw manager was found dead of cyanide poisoning, and photographs of welds {{were stolen from a}} <b>pump</b> <b>station</b> construction camp. Alyeska began a review of all 30,800 welds that had been done in 1975, and submitted its report to the Interior Department in April 1976. In May, it submitted its technical analysis and a report on repair work under way. The review produced a list of 3,955 questionable welds—10 percent of 1975's work.|$|E

The Long Hill Road pump house is the primary water supply for the village with supply capacity exceeding 3.5 million gallons per day (MGD). Briarcliff Manor's average daily water supply demand is 1.45 MGD with a peak demand of 3.5 MGD. Briarcliff Manor has four water storage tanks (at Rosecliff, Farm Road, the former King's College, and the Edith Macy Conference Center) and two pump stations (the Long Hill Road pump house and the Dalmeny Road <b>pump</b> <b>station).</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{series of}} taxes levied on oil {{production}} in Alaska has changed several times since 1977, {{but the overall}} form remains mostly the same. Alaska receives royalties from oil production on state land. The state also has a property tax on oil production structures and transportation (pipeline) property—the only state property tax in Alaska. There is a special corporate income tax on petroleum companies, and the state taxes the amount of petroleum produced. This production tax is levied {{on the cost of}} oil at <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 1. To calculate this tax, the state takes the market value of the oil, subtracts transportation costs (tanker and pipeline tariffs), subtracts production costs, then multiplies the resulting amount per barrel of oil produced each month. The state then takes a percentage of the dollar figure produced.|$|E
25|$|By September 6, 2005, {{the pump}} {{stations}} {{began to get}} online on 17th Street Canal. <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 10 was actually pumping at this point. <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 6 was interrupted to clean up some debris out of the area. <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 1, {{which is a little}} bit further up in the system, was pumping to <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 6, so as to drain the upper area, uptown areas. Over on the east side, <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 19 had been running for some time. Two of the three big pumping stations in New Orleans East were running, in addition to temporary pumps. At least one <b>pump</b> <b>station</b> was running in Plaquemines Parish.|$|E
25|$|In East Orleans, {{four more}} {{portable}} pumps {{were to be}} added in support of <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 15 to increase the overall capacity to 1,100 cubic feet per second (31 m³/s). For the first time, the Jahncke <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> ran at its full capacity of 1,200 cubic feet per second (34 m³/s). Citrus <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> and St. Charles <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> each were running at half capacity because the Citrus <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> has to pull power from a generator {{at one of the}} other two stations. Total possible capacity for these two stations is 1,750 cubic feet per second (50 m³/s).|$|E

25|$|By September 12, 2005, {{water had}} {{overtopped}} the temporary breach closure at the London Avenue Canal because of operations at <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 3. This caused the canal to rise {{faster than the}} temporary pumps {{at the end of}} the canal could drain. Operations at <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 3 were immediately stopped and a few sheet piles were removed to allow the canal water level to equalize.|$|E
25|$|Corps crews in Saint Bernard Parish cut {{the roadway}} at Highway 48 to allow {{drainage}} to <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 8. At Pump Stations 1, 4, 6 and 7, the Corps installed booms or floating oil barriers to protect facilities from oil hazards. The Corps continued {{to monitor the}} area.
