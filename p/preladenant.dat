50|$|<b>Preladenant</b> (SCH 420814) was a {{drug that}} was {{developed}} by Schering-Plough which acted as a potent and selective antagonist at the adenosine A2A receptor. It was being researched as a potential treatment for Parkinson's disease. Positive results were reported in Phase II clinical trials in humans, {{but it did not}} prove itself to be more effective than a placebo during Phase III trials, and so was discontinued in May 2013.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{serotonin}} 5 -HT 1 A/ 1 B {{receptor agonist}} eltoprazine suppressed dyskinetic-like behavior in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) but simultaneously reduced levodopa (l-dopa) -induced motility. Moreover, adenosine A 2 A receptor antagonists, such as <b>preladenant,</b> significantly increased l-dopa efficacy in PD without exacerbating dyskinetic-like behavior. Objectives: We evaluated whether {{a combination of}} eltoprazine and <b>preladenant</b> may prevent or suppress l-dopa-induced dyskinesia, without impairing l-dopa's efficacy in relieving motor signs, in 2 PD models: unilateral 6 -hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats and 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) -treated monkeys. Methods: Rotational behavior and abnormal involuntary movements, or disability and l-dopa-induced dyskinesia were evaluated in 6 -hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats and MPTP-treated monkeys, respectively. Moreover, in the rodent striatum, induction of immediate-early gene zif- 268, an index of long-term changes, was correlated with dyskinesia. Results: In 6 -hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats, combined administration of l-dopa (4 mg/kg) plus eltoprazine (0. 6 mg/kg) plus <b>preladenant</b> (0. 3 mg/kg) significantly prevented or reduced dyskinetic-like behavior without impairing motor activity. Zif- 268 was increased in the striatum of rats treated with l-dopa and l-dopa plus <b>preladenant</b> compared with vehicle. In contrast, rats treated with eltoprazine (with or without <b>preladenant)</b> had lower zif- 268 activation after chronic treatment in both the dyskinetic and l-dopa-non-primed groups. Moreover, acute l-dopa plus eltoprazine plus <b>preladenant</b> prevented worsening of motor performance (adjusting step) and sensorimotor integration deficit. Similar results were obtained in MPTP-treated monkeys, where a combination of <b>preladenant</b> with eltoprazine was found to counteract dyskinesia and maintain the full therapeutic effects of a low dose of l-dopa. Conclusions: Our results suggest a promising nondopaminergic pharmacological strategy {{for the treatment of}} dyskinesia in P...|$|E

Additional post hoc analyses were conducted to compare the effect of the combination with the effect of the drugs alone. Motor activity improved significantly and was sustained for longer when the drugs were given in combination than when administered separately at the same dose. Similarly, when tested as add-on treatment to L-Dopa, the combinations resulted in higher levels of contralateral rotation in comparison to the single drugs. Of special interest, the activity observed with some combinations could not be described by a simplistic additive effect and involved more subtle synergistic pharmacological interactions. The combined administration of A 2 A/NR 2 B-receptor antagonists improved motor behaviour in 6 -OHDA rats. Given the proven translatability of this model such a combination may be expected to be effective in improving motor symptoms in patients...|$|E
40|$|C- 11 -preladenant was {{developed}} as a novel PET ligand for the adenosine A(2 A) receptors (A(2 A) Rs). The present study aimed to evaluate the suitability of C- 11 -preladenant PET for the quantification of striatal A(2 A) Rs and the assessment of A(2 A) R occupancy in the conscious monkey brain. Methods: C- 11 -preladenant was intravenously injected into conscious monkeys (n = 4, 18 PET scans), and a 91 -min dynamic scan was started. Arterial blood samples in combination with metabolite analysis were obtained during the scan to provide the input function for kinetic modeling. The distribution volume (VT) was obtained by kinetic modeling with a 2 -tissue-compartment model. The simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) with selected reference regions (cerebellum, cingulate, parietal cortex, and occipital cortex) was tested to estimate the binding potential (BPND) in kAR-rich regions. BPND obtained from the SRTM was compared with distribution volume ratio (DVR) - 1. The effects of blood volume, blood delay, and scan duration on BPND and DVR- 1 were investigated. VT and BPND were also obtained after preblocking with unlabeled <b>preladenant</b> (1 mg/kg), A(2 A) R-selective KW- 6002 (0. 5 - 1 mg/kg), and nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine (2. 5 - 10 mg/kg). A(2 A) R occupancy was studied with caffeine blockade. Results: Regional uptake of 11 c_preladenant {{was consistent with the}} distribution of A(2 A) Rs in the monkey brain, with the highest uptake in the putamen, followed by the caudate, and the lowest uptake in the cerebellum. Tracer kinetics were well described by the 2 -tissue-compartment model with a lower constraint on k 4 to stabilize fits. The highest VT was observed in A 2 AR-rich regions (- 5. 8 - 7. 4) and lowest value in the cerebellum (- 1. 3). BPND values estimated from the SRTM with different scan durations were comparable and were in agreement with DVR- 1 (- 4. 3 - 5. 3 in A(2 A) R-rich regions). <b>preladenant</b> preinjection decreased the tracer uptake in A(2 A) R-rich regions {{to the level of the}} reference regions. Caffeine pretreatment reduced the tracer up take in the striatum in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion: C- 11 -preladenant PET is suitable for noninvasive quantification of A(2 A) Rs and assessment of A(2 A) R occupancy in A(2 A) R-rich regions in the monkey brain. SRTM using the cerebellum as the reference tissue is the applicable model for A(2 A) R quantification...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMedicinal {{chemical}} {{approaches have}} been applied to {{all four of the}} adenosine receptor (AR) subtypes (A 1, A 2 A, A 2 B, and A 3) to create selective agonists and antagonists for each. The most recent class of selective AR ligands to be reported is the class of A 2 BAR agonists. The availability of these selective ligands has facilitated research on therapeutic applications of modulating the ARs and in some cases has provided clinical candidates. Prodrug approaches have been developed which improve the bioavailability of the drugs, reduce side-effects, and/or may lead to site-selective effects. The A 2 A agonist regadenoson (Lexiscan®), a diagnostic drug for myocardial perfusion imaging, is the first selective AR agonist to be approved. Other selective agonists and antagonists are or were undergoing clinical trials for a broad range of indications, including capadenoson and tecadenoson (A 1 agonists) for atrial fibrillation, or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, respectively, apadenoson and binodenoson (A 2 A agonists) for myocardial perfusion imaging, <b>preladenant</b> (A 2 A antagonist) for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, and CF 101 and CF 102 (A 3 agonists) for inflammatory diseases and cancer, respectively.

40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic, {{progressive}} {{disease of the}} central nervous system (CNS),characterized by a slow loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to significantdecrease in dopamine (DA) levels in the striatum. Currently used drugs, such as levodopa(L-DOPA), amantadine, dopamine agonists (D) or anticholinergic drugs, are not effective enough,and do not eliminate the causes of disease. Many research centers are conducting researchon new forms of currently used drugs (e. g. Duodopa, XP 21279, IPX 066), new drugs of alreadyknown groups (e. g. safinamide), medicines that suppress side effects of L-DOPA (e. g. AFQ 056,fipamezole), and, finally, compounds with a novel mechanism of action (e. g. PMY 50028, A 2 Areceptor antagonists). A lot of scientific reports indicate an important role of A 2 A receptorsin the regulation of the central movement system, so a new group of compounds – selectiveantagonists of A 2 A receptors (e. g. istradefylline, <b>preladenant,</b> SYN 115) – has been developed and their potential use in PD has been examined. Clinical studies of A 2 A receptor antagonistshave shown that this group of compounds can shorten off periods {{and at the same time}} theydo not worsen dyskinesias in patients with PD. Moreover, there is ongoing research on newforms of treatment, such as gene therapy. Attempts to apply the viral vector AAV- 2, whichwill be able to infect neurons with a variety of genes, including the gene of glutamate decarboxylase(GAD), neurturin (NTN), or aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, are currently beingcarried out. The results of phase I and II clinical studies showed some efficacy of this form oftreatment, but the method requires further studies. An analysis of potential future therapiesof Parkinson’s disease suggests that some progress in this field has been made...|$|E
40|$|Over {{a period}} of more than 50 years, the {{symptomatic}} treatment of the motor symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD) has been optimized using pharmacotherapy, deep brain stimulation, and physiotherapy. The arsenal of pharmacotherapies includes L-Dopa, several dopamine agonists, inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (MAO) -B and catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT), and amantadine. In the later course of the disease, motor complications occur, at which stage different oral formulations of L-Dopa or dopamine agonists with long half-life, a transdermal application or parenteral pumps for continuous drug supply can be subscribed. Alternatively, the patient is offered deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or the internal part of the globus pallidus (GPi). For a more efficacious treatment of motor complications, new formulations of L-Dopa, dopamine agonists, and amantadine {{as well as new}} MAO-B and COMT inhibitors are currently tested in clinical trials, and some of them already yielding positive results in phase 3 trials. In addition, non-dopaminergic agents have been tested in the early clinical phase for the treatment of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia, including adenosine A 2 A antagonists (istradefylline, <b>preladenant,</b> and tozadenant) and modulators of the metabolic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR 5 - mavoglurant) and serotonin (eltoprazine) receptors. Recent clinical trials testing coenzyme Q 10, the dopamine agonist pramipexole, creatine monohydrate, pioglitazone, or AAV-mediated gene therapy aimed at increasing expression of neurturin, did not prove efficacious. Treatment with nicotine, caffeine, inosine (a precursor of urate), and isradipine (a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker), as well as active and passive immunization against α-synuclein and inhibitors or modulators of α-synuclein-aggregation are currently studied in clinical trials. However, to date, no disease-modifying treatment is available. We here review the current status of treatment options for motor and non-motor symptoms, and discuss current investigative strategies for disease modification. This review provides basic insights, mainly addressing basic scientists and non-specialists. It stresses the need to intensify therapeutic PD research and points out reasons why the translation of basic research to disease-modifying therapies has been unsuccessful so far...|$|E
40|$|Question:[1, 2, 4]Triazolo[1, 5 -c]pyrimidine (TP) {{derivatives}} {{are reported}} in literature as A 2 A adenosine receptor (AR) antagonists useful {{for the treatment of}} Parkinson’s disease, senile dementia and depression (1). 1 The Schering compound, <b>preladenant</b> (2), a pyrazolo[4, 3 -e] 1, 2, 4 -triazolo[1, 5 -c]pyrimidine (PTP) A 2 A antagonist, possesses a lateral substituent {{similar to those of the}} TP compound 1. 2, 3 Although these two compounds are both potent A 2 A antagonist, the TP nucleus possesses a simpler structure and less nitrogen atoms than PTPs, thus it may be a scaffold with promising pharmacokinetics properties. So, starting from the structural similarity between TP and PTP A 2 A AR antagonists, and our experience on PTP nucleus as A 3 AR antagonists, we decided to explore the TP scaffold in order to obtain potent antagonists towards A 3 AR. Methods: All compounds were synthesized according to literature 1 and have been evaluated for potency at all four human ARs. Results: Initially, we introduced at the 5 position of the TP scaffold the same substituents which gave affinity and selectivity at the A 3 AR at the 5 position in the PTP nucleus. On the basis of obtained results, the optimization of substitutions at the 5, 8 and 2 positions, which led to 147 [1, 2, 4]triazolo[1, 5 -c]pyrimidine derivatives, allowed us to reach subnanomolar Ki values at the A 3 AR and good levels of selectivity versus the other adenosine receptor subtypes. Conclusions: A novel promising class of potent and selective A 3 adenosine receptor antagonist with a [1, 2, 4]triazolo[1, 5 -c]pyrimidine nucleus was discovered.
