5|$|The {{original}} 5.7×28mm cartridge, {{called the}} SS90, {{was introduced in}} 1990. It used a 1.5 gram (23grain) plastic-core projectile, which was propelled at a muzzle velocity of roughly 850m/s (2,800ft/s or Mach 2.5) when fired from the P90. A United States <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> for the projectile design used in the SS90 was filed by FN's Jean-Paul Denis and Marc Neuforge in 1989. U.S. Patent 5,012,743 ("High-Performance Projectile") was received in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Pigeon {{photography}} is an aerial photography technique invented in 1907 by the German apothecary Julius Neubronner, who also used pigeons to deliver medications. A homing pigeon was fitted with an aluminium breast harness {{to which a}} lightweight time-delayed miniature camera could be attached. Neubronner's German <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> was initially rejected, but was granted in December 1908 after he produced authenticated photographs taken by his pigeons. He publicized the technique at the 1909 Dresden International Photographic Exhibition, and sold some images as postcards at the Frankfurt International Aviation Exhibition and at the 1910 and 1911 Paris Air Shows.|$|E

5|$|A 1951 letter {{showed that}} Bradner clearly {{understood}} that the insulation in such a suit was not provided by the water between the suit and the skin, but rather that this layer of water next to the skin, if trapped, would quickly heat to skin temperature, if the material in the suit were insulative. Thus, the suit only needed to limit purging by fresh cold water, {{and it did not}} need to be dry to work. He applied for a U.S. patent for the wetsuit, but his <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> was turned down due to its similar design with the flight suit. The United States Navy also did not adopt the new wetsuits because of worries that the neoprene in the wetsuits might make its swimmers easier to spot by underwater sonar and, thus, could not exclusively profit from his invention.|$|E
5|$|Although {{other firms}} {{expressed}} interest to Kates and Rogers Majestic {{in using the}} tubes, issues with acquiring patents prevented him, Rogers Majestic, or the University of Toronto from patenting the tubes anywhere outside Canada until 1955, and the <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> was not accepted in the United States until March 1957, six years after filing. By then, research and use of vacuum tubes was heavily waning {{in the face of}} the rise of the superior transistor, preventing any re-visitation of Bertie or similar machines. Kates went on to a distinguished career in Canadian engineering, but did not return to working on vacuum tubes or computer games.|$|E
40|$|We studied {{trends in}} genetic <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> {{in order to}} {{identify}} the trends in the commercialization of research findings in genetics. To define genetic <b>patent</b> <b>applications,</b> the European version (ECLA) of the International Patent Classification (IPC) codes was used. Genetic <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> data from the PATSTAT database from 1990 until 2009 were analyzed for time trends and regional distribution. Overall, the number of <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> has been growing. In 2009, 152 [*] 000 <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> were submitted under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and within the EP (European Patent) system of the European Patent Office (EPO). The number of genetic <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> increased until a peak was reached in the year 2000, with > 8000 applications, after which it declined by almost 50 %. Continents show different patterns over time, with the global peak in 2000 mainly explained by the USA and Europe, while Asia shows a stable number of > 1000 per year. Nine countries together account for 98. 9 % {{of the total number of}} genetic <b>patent</b> <b>applications.</b> In The Netherlands, 26. 7 % of the genetic <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> originate from public research institutions. After the year 2000, the number of genetic <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> dropped significantly.

5|$|The Kinetoscope is {{an early}} motion picture {{exhibition}} device. The Kinetoscope was designed for films to be viewed by one individual at a time through a peephole viewer window {{at the top of}} the device. The Kinetoscope was not a movie projector, but introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection before the advent of video, by creating the illusion of movement by conveying a strip of perforated film bearing sequential images over a light source with a high-speed shutter. A process using roll film first described in a <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> submitted in France and the U.S. by French inventor Louis Le Prince, the concept was also used by U.S. inventor Thomas Edison in 1889, and subsequently developed by his employee William Kennedy Laurie Dickson between 1889 and 1892. Dickson and his team at the Edison lab also devised the Kinetograph, an innovative motion picture camera with rapid intermittent, or stop-and-go, film movement, to photograph movies for in-house experiments and, eventually, commercial Kinetoscope presentations.|$|E
5|$|The {{additional}} turbo-propulseur <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> 13.502, dated 3 December 1910, {{was implemented}} on a double-seat motorised sled commissioned by Cyril Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia. With {{the help of}} Despujols, a boat maker, and the motor manufacturer Gregoire, Coandă supervised {{the building of a}} motor sled, powered by a 30hp (22kW) Gregoire engine driving the turbo-propulseur. The sledge was blessed by Russian Orthodox priests at the Despujols plant near Paris on 2 December 1910. Starting the next day, it was exhibited for two weeks at the 12th Automobile Salon of France, alongside Gregoire-powered automobiles on the Gregoire stand. A number of automobile and general interest magazines published photographs or sketches of the sledge. A version of Coandă's turbo-propulseur design was shown {{for the second time in}} late 1910 at the Grand Palais of Paris. One of the periodicals reported an expected speed of , but no account exists of the sledge being tested.|$|E
5|$|The Kinect, a motion-sensing {{input device}} made by Microsoft and {{designed}} as a video game controller, was first introduced in November 2010, and was upgraded for the 2013 release of the eighth-generation Xbox One video game console. Kinect's capabilities were revealed in May 2013. The new Kinect uses an ultra-wide 1080p camera, which can function in the dark due to an infrared sensor. It employs higher-end processing power and new software, can distinguish between fine movements (such as a thumb movements), and can determine a user's heart rate by looking at his/her face. Microsoft filed a <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> in 2011 that suggests that the corporation may use the Kinect camera system to monitor the behavior of television viewers {{as part of a}} plan to make the viewing experience more interactive. On July 19, 2013, Microsoft stocks suffered its biggest one-day percentage sell-off since the year 2000 after its fourth-quarter report raised concerns among the investors on the poor showings of both Windows 8 and the Surface tablet; with more than 11 percentage points declining Microsoft suffered a loss of more than US$32 billion. For the 2010 fiscal year, Microsoft had five product divisions: Windows Division, Server and Tools, Online Services Division, Microsoft Business Division and Entertainment and Devices Division.|$|E

30|$|Figure  7 {{shows that}} of all the {{industries}} construction has a significant contribution to the increase in labor cost over time.

5|$|The aircraft's {{construction}} was a novelty for the time. In {{contrast to the}} monoplane described in the July 1910 <b>patent</b> <b>application,</b> the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction, but in return solved lateral stability control issues. The cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from flying wires. According to Coandă's description the wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure. The trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit. The fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by The Technical World magazine as having a framework of steel, though the construction photographs indicate {{that it had a}} wooden framework. This was triangular in cross-section with convex ribs edged with strips of steel, and strengthened with a covering of heat-shaped moulded plywood. Tubular radiators for engine cooling were located {{on either side of the}} cockpit. The vertical struts from the wings were secured to the fuselage with steel collars fixed with screws. The fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45° angles to vertical and horizontal. Four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large Antoinette VII-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit, one on each side, and were used for pitch and directional control. It was an early instance of what are now known as ruddervators. Forward of the tail was a small horizontal stabiliser. The fuel tank was located in the fuselage between the engine and the cockpit.|$|E

On May 21, 1953, Harwick Johnson filed a <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> for a method of forming various electronic components – transistors, resistors, lumped and distributed capacitances – on a single chip. Johnson described three ways of producing an integrated one-transistor oscillator. All of them used a narrow strip of a semiconductor with a bipolar transistor on one end and differed in the methods of producing the transistor. The strip acted as a series of resistors; the lumped capacitors were formed by fusion whereas inverse-biased p-n junctions acted as distributed capacitors. Johnson did not offer a technological procedure, and it is not known whether he produced an actual device. In 1959, a variant of his proposal was implemented and patented by Jack Kilby.|$|E
