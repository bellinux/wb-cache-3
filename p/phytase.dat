2500|$|The Enviropig is {{a genetically}} {{modified}} Yorkshire pig that expresses <b>phytase</b> in its saliva. Grains, such as corn and wheat, have phosphorus that is bound in an naturally indigestible form known as phytic acid. Phosphorus, an essential nutrient for pigs, is then {{added to the}} diet, since {{it can not be}} broken down in the pigs digestive tract. [...] As a result, nearly all of the phosphorus naturally found in the grain is wasted in the feces, and can contribute to elevated levels in the soil. <b>Phytase</b> is an enzyme that is able to break down the otherwise indigestible phytic acid, making it available to the pig. The ability of the Enviropig to digest the phosphorus from the grains eliminates the waste of that natural phosphorus (20-60% reduction), while also eliminating the need to supplement the nutrient in feed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phytase</b> {{is used as}} {{an animal}} feed {{supplement}} - often in poultry and swine - to enhance the nutritive value of plant material by liberation of inorganic phosphate from phytic acid (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate). <b>Phytase</b> can be purified from transgenic microbes and has been produced recently in transgenic canola, alfalfa and rice plants. <b>Phytase</b> can also be produced {{on a large scale}} through cellulosic biomass fermentation using genetically modified (GM) yeast. <b>Phytase</b> can also be isolated from basidiomycetes fungi. The Enviropig, a strain of transgenic pig, can produce <b>phytase,</b> reducing its environmental impact.|$|E
50|$|Enviropigs {{produce the}} enzyme <b>phytase</b> in their salivary glands.

40|$|<b>Phytases</b> are a {{group of}} enzymes capable of {{releasing}} phosphate from phytate, {{one of the most}} abundant forms of organic phosphate in the natural environment. <b>Phytases</b> can be found in many organisms; in bacteria, they are particularly described in g-proteobacteria. In recent years, bacterial <b>phytases</b> have been isolated, characterized and proposed as potential tools in biotechnology. Microbial <b>phytases</b> have been applied mainly to animal (swine and poultry) and human foodstuffs in order to improve mineral bioavailability and food processing. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of bacterial <b>phytases</b> and phytase-producing bacteria, as well as their potential biotechnological applications, including new fields poorly explored, such as fish nutrition, environmental protection and plant nutrition. Despite the recognized importance in biotechnology, information on bacterial <b>phytases</b> and phytase-producing bacteria is clearly limited and major efforts are required to improve the knowledge of <b>phytases</b> present in bacteria and their utilization.

40|$|<b>Phytases</b> of {{different}} origin were covalently bound onto Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticles (12 nm). Binding efficiencies {{of all three}} <b>phytases</b> were well above 70 % relative {{to the number of}} aldehyde groups available {{on the surface of the}} magnetic nanoparticles. Temperature stability for all three <b>phytases</b> was enhanced as a consequence of immobilisation, whereas pH dependence of enzyme activity was not affected. Maximum catalytic activity of the immobilised <b>phytases</b> was found at 60 °C (rye), 65 °C (Aspergillus niger) and 70 °C (Escherichia albertii). The immobilised enzymes exhibited the same excellent substrate specificities and unique myo-inositol phosphate phosphatase activities as their soluble counterparts. However, the catalytic turnover number dropped drastically for the immobilised <b>phytases.</b> The amount of the desired partially phosphorylated myo-inositol phosphate isomer could be easily controlled by the contact time of substrate solution and immobilised enzymes.

50|$|<b>Phytase</b> is {{produced}} by bacteria found in the gut of ruminant animals (cattle, sheep) {{making it possible for}} them to use the phytic acid found in grains as a source of phosphorus. Non-ruminants (monogastric animals) like human beings, dogs, birds, etc. do not produce <b>phytase.</b> Research in the field of animal nutrition has put forth the idea of supplementing feed with <b>phytase</b> so as to make available to the animal phytate-bound nutrients like calcium, phosphorus, other minerals, carbohydrates, and proteins.|$|E
50|$|Phosphorus and {{inositol}} in phytate form are not, in general, bioavailable to nonruminant animals {{because these}} animals lack the digestive enzyme <b>phytase</b> required to remove phosphate from the inositol in the phytate molecule.

50|$|Most of {{the known}} phytases belong to a class of enzyme called {{histidine}} acid phosphatases (HAPs). HAPs have been isolated from filamentous fungi, bacteria, yeast, and plants. All members of this class of <b>phytase</b> share a common active site sequence motif (Arg-His-Gly-X-Arg-X-Pro) and have a two-step mechanism that hydrolyzes phytic acid (as well as some other phosphoesters). The <b>phytase</b> from the fungus Aspergillus niger is a HAP and {{is well known for}} its high specific activity and its commercially marketed role as an animal feed additive to increase the bioavailability of phosphate from phytic acid in the grain-based diets of poultry and swine.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of phytic acid during development of lily (Lilium longiflorum Thunb.) pollen and its degradation during germination have been studied. A {{substantial amount of}} phytic acid accumulates in lily pollen by 5 days before anthesis, and little change occurs during subsequent maturation.

Considerable degradation of phytic acid occurs by 15 minutes of incubation in glucose culture medium, and very little is left by 3 hours. No partially phosphorylated myo-inositol accumulates during germination. The breakdown of phytic acid proceeds at a constant rate during this time period. The rate is calculated to be 0. 037 microgram phytic acid/milligram pollen/minute. Two <b>phytases</b> are detected in germinated lily pollen extract using high performance liquid chromatography with an anion exchange column (diethylaminoethyl- 5 PW).

Phy I exhibited very broad substrate specificity while Phy II was more specific for sodium phytate. Similarly Phy II was strongly inhibited by Ag+, Hg 2 + (1  mM) metal ions and Phy I was partially inhibited. Peptide analysis by Mass Spectrometry (MS) MALDI-TOF also indicated that both the proteins were totally different.

40|$|The {{major part}} of iron present in plant foods such as cereals is largely {{unavailable}} for direct absorption in humans due to complexation with the negatively charged phosphate groups of phytate (myo-inositol (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) -hexakisphosphate). Human biology has not evolved an efficient mechanism to naturally release iron from iron phytate complexes. This narrative review will evaluate the quantitative significance of phytase-catalysed iron release from cereal foods. In vivo studies have shown how addition of microbially derived <b>phytases</b> to cereal-based foods has produced increased iron absorption via enzyme-catalysed dephosphorylation of phytate, indicating the potential of this strategy for preventing and treating iron deficiency anaemia. Despite the immense promise of this strategy and the prevalence of iron deficiency worldwide, the number of human studies elucidating the significance of phytase-mediated improvements in iron absorption and ultimately in iron status in particularly vulnerable groups is still low. A more detailed understanding of (1) the uptake mechanism for iron released from partially dephosphorylated phytate chelates, (2) the affinity of microbially derived <b>phytases</b> towards insoluble iron phytate complexes, and (3) the extent of phytate dephosphorylation required for iron release from inositol phosphates is warranted.
