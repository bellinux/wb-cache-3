5|$|The away team scans Armus' energy field, {{finding that}} when Armus engulfs {{the shuttle and}} speaks to Troi, expressing his remorse and <b>pity,</b> <b>the</b> field disrupting their {{transporter}} signals is weakened which could allow them to beam Troi and the pilot out of the shuttle. After Armus toys with Troi by completely engulfing Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Captain Picard beams down to speak to Armus directly, sending {{the rest of the}} away team to the ship. Picard engages Armus in a heated discussion to discover its motive, which is to seek revenge on those that abandoned it on Vagra II. Armus is riled to a point where the energy field is dissipated enough, allowing for Picard, Troi and the pilot to be safely beamed back to the Enterprise. After destroying the shuttlecraft from orbit, Picard orders a quarantine on Vagra II.|$|E

[...] "Little Mandy's Christmas-Tree", [...] "The Absence of Little Wesley", and [...] "The Happy Little Cripple" [...] were about poverty, the death of a child, and disabilities. Like his children's poems, they too contained morals, suggesting society should <b>pity</b> <b>the</b> downtrodden and be charitable.|$|E

500|$|Conn quickly {{began to}} promote Bowie. The singer's debut single, [...] "Liza Jane", {{credited}} to Davie Jones and the King Bees, had no commercial success. Dissatisfied with the King Bees and their repertoire of Howlin' Wolf and Willie Dixon blues numbers, Bowie quit the band {{less than a}} month later to join the Manish Boys, another blues outfit, who incorporated folk and soul—"I used to dream of being their Mick Jagger", Bowie was to recall. Their cover of Bobby Bland's [...] "I <b>Pity</b> <b>the</b> Fool" [...] was no more successful than [...] "Liza Jane", and Bowie soon moved on again to join the Lower Third, a blues trio strongly influenced by the Who. [...] "You've Got a Habit of Leaving" [...] fared no better, signalling the end of Conn's contract. Declaring that he would exit the pop world [...] "to study mime at Sadler's Wells", Bowie nevertheless remained with the Lower Third. His new manager, Ralph Horton, later instrumental in his transition to solo artist, soon witnessed Bowie's move to yet another group, the Buzz, yielding the singer's fifth unsuccessful single release, [...] "Do Anything You Say". While with the Buzz, Bowie also joined the Riot Squad; their recordings, which included a Bowie number and the Velvet Underground material, went unreleased. Ken Pitt, introduced by Horton, took over as Bowie's manager.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, {{the band}} co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Green Day. The tour was {{conceived}} by Blink-182 to echo the famous Monsters of Rock tours; {{the idea was}} to have, effectively, a Monsters of Punk tour. The tour, from the band's point of view, had been put together as a show of unity in the face of consistent accusations of rivalry between the two bands, especially in Europe. Instead, Green Day's Tré Cool acknowledged in a Kerrang! interview that they committed to the tour as an opportunity to regain their reputation as a great live band, as they felt their spotlight had faded over the years. [...] "We set out to reclaim our throne as the most incredible live punk band from you know who," [...] said Cool. Cool contended that [...] "we heard they were going to quit the tour because they were getting smoked so badly... We didn't want them to quit the tour. They're good for filling up the seats up front." [...] Several reviewers were unimpressed with Blink-182's headlining set following Green Day. [...] "Sometimes playing last at a rock show is more a curse than a privilege... <b>Pity</b> <b>the</b> headliner, for instance, that gets blown off the stage by the band before it. Blink-182 endured that indignity Saturday at the Shoreline Amphitheatre," [...] a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle wrote in 2002.|$|E
500|$|Shaw {{maintained}} a provocative and frequently self-contradictory attitude to Shakespeare (whose name {{he insisted on}} spelling [...] "Shakespear"). Many found him difficult to take seriously on the subject; Duff Cooper observed that by attacking Shakespeare, [...] "it is Shaw who appears a ridiculous pigmy shaking his fist at a mountain." [...] Shaw was, nevertheless, a knowledgeable Shakespearian, and {{in an article in}} which he wrote, [...] "With the single exception of Homer, there is no eminent writer, not even Sir Walter Scott, whom I can despise so entirely as I despise Shakespear when I measure my mind against his," [...] he also said, [...] "But I am bound to add that I <b>pity</b> <b>the</b> man who cannot enjoy Shakespear. He has outlasted thousands of abler thinkers, and will outlast a thousand more". Shaw had two regular targets for his more extreme comments about Shakespeare: undiscriminating [...] "Bardolaters", and actors and directors who presented insensitively cut texts in over-elaborate productions. He was continually drawn back to Shakespeare, and wrote three plays with Shakespearean themes: The Dark Lady of the Sonnets, Cymbeline Refinished and Shakes versus Shav. In a 2001 analysis of Shaw's Shakespearian criticisms, Robert Pierce concludes that Shaw, who was no academic, saw Shakespeare's plays—like all theatre—from an author's practical point of view: [...] "Shaw helps us {{to get away from the}} Romantics' picture of Shakespeare as a titanic genius, one whose art cannot be analyzed or connected with the mundane considerations of theatrical conditions and profit and loss, or with a specific staging and cast of actors." ...|$|E
500|$|Steiger {{was one of}} Hollywood's most {{respected}} character actors; Hutchinson described him as [...] "one of Hollywood's most charismatic and dynamic stars". Yet for Hutchinson, Steiger remained [...] "out of sympathy with Hollywood" [...] during his career, believing that accomplished actors often struggle to find challenging films as they got older. Steiger was an [...] "effusive talent" [...] according to Lucia Bozzola of The New York Times, and was particularly noted for his intense portrayal of offbeat, often volatile and crazed characters. After On the Waterfront (1954), Steiger became somewhat typecast for playing tough characters and villains, and grew increasingly frustrated playing the [...] "Mafia heavy or a near-psychopath" [...] during the 1970s, roles which he could play menacingly, but provided little opportunity for him to showcase his talent. Gossip columnist Louella Parsons hailed him as [...] "the Screen's No.1 Bad Man", while the newspaper London Evening News referred to him as [...] "the man you would love to hate {{if you had the}} coverage". A 1960 publication by Dean Jennings of The Saturday Evening Post referred to Steiger as an [...] "angry, hot-tempered newcomer of prodigious acting talents, [...] works best only at emotional white heat", and remarked that he found it [...] "stimulating to carry theatrical fantasy into his private life". Pauline Kael found his performances so powerful that she believed he [...] "often seems to take over a picture even when he isn't in the lead". The journal Films and Filming, surveying his career in 1971, noted that his talent [...] "developed steadily through films good and bad", and that the secret of his success was that he stayed grounded, citing a 1956 interview where he said [...] "I <b>pity</b> <b>the</b> player who can't keep his feet on the ground. It's too easy to trade on success and forget that no performer can stand still." ...|$|E
