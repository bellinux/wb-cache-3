5|$|Treatment for {{antifreeze}} poisoning {{needs to}} be started as soon after ingestion as <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> effective; the earlier treatment is started, the greater the chance of survival. Cats must be treated within 3 hours of ingesting of antifreeze to be effective, while dogs must be treated within 8–12 hours of ingestion. Once kidney failure develops, the prognosis is poor.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{transmitted}} by three main routes: sexual contact, significant exposure to infected body fluids or tissues, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding (known as vertical transmission). There is no risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to feces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, or vomit unless these are contaminated with blood. It is <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> co-infected {{by more than}} one strain of HIV—a condition known as HIV superinfection.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} development which reduced Gill Sans' dominance was {{the arrival}} of phototypesetting, which allowed typefaces to be printed from photographs on film and (especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used. Dry transfers like Letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects; their sans-serif Compacta and Stephenson Blake's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs. Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s, {{when he was growing}} up, James Mosley would later write: The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape... in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, it was <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bored by them and to begin to rebel against the bland good taste that they represented. In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long. The death of metal type... seemed at last to be happening.|$|E

50|$|Another {{argument}} for ex nihilo creation comes from Claude Nowell's Summum philosophy that states before anything existed, nothing existed, and if nothing existed, {{then it must}} have <b>been</b> <b>possible</b> for nothing <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> If it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> for nothing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> (the argument goes), then it must <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> for everything <b>to</b> <b>be.</b>|$|R

5|$|Like {{all other}} US states, New Jersey sets a 0.08 percent {{weight by volume}} blood alcohol content (BAC) as the {{threshold}} for intoxication when operating a motor vehicle (e.g. automobile, boat). It is <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> charged with {{driving under the influence}} (DUI) with a BAC level below 0.08%, but there is a presumption in that situation that the driver is not intoxicated. State law prohibits those under 21 from driving if their BAC is 0.01% or more, prohibits the operation of a commercial vehicle with a BAC of 0.04% or more, and mandates that drivers submit a breath sample if requested by a police officer. To be convicted of DUI in New Jersey, a person must be operating or attempting to operate a motorized vehicle; thus activities such as sleeping in a car while intoxicated or bicycling while drunk are not illegal.|$|E
5|$|The two-player {{game has}} the players {{engaged in a}} dogfight between two spaceships set against the {{backdrop}} of a randomly generated background starfield. The game was developed to meet three precepts: to use as much of the computer's resources as <b>possible,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> consistently interesting and therefore have every run be different, and to be entertaining and therefore a game. The game was a multiplayer game because the computer had no resources left over to handle controlling the other ship. After the game's initial development, members of the TMRC worked to improve the game, adding an accurate starfield and a gravitational body, and spread it to the couple dozen other institutions with a PDP-1, a process which continued over the next few years. As the computer was uncomfortable to use for extended periods of time, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad. Spacewar was reportedly used as a smoke test by DEC technicians on new PDP-1 systems before shipping, since it was the only available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware. Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 and only 55 were ever sold, many without a monitor, which prohibited Spacewar or any game of the time from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience. Russell has been quoted as saying that the aspect of the game that he was most pleased with was the number of other programmers it inspired to write their own games.|$|E

25|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} passerine families and the relationships among them remained rather mysterious until the late 20th century. In many cases, passerine families were grouped together {{on the basis of}} morphological similarities that, it is now believed, are the result of convergent evolution, not a close genetic relationship. For example, the wrens of the Americas and Eurasia; those of Australia; and those of New Zealand look superficially similar and behave in similar ways, and yet belong to three far-flung branches of the passerine family tree; they are as unrelated as it is <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> while remaining Passeriformes.|$|E
25|$|Evidence-based {{medicine}} is a contemporary movement {{to establish the}} most effective algorithms of practice (ways of doing things) {{through the use of}} systematic reviews and meta-analysis. The movement is facilitated by modern global information science, which allows as much of the available evidence as <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> collected and analyzed according to standard protocols that are then disseminated to healthcare providers. The Cochrane Collaboration leads this movement. A 2001 review of 160 Cochrane systematic reviews revealed that, according to two readers, 21.3% of the reviews concluded insufficient evidence, 20% concluded evidence of no effect, and 22.5% concluded positive effect.|$|E
