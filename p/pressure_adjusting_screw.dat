5000|$|The {{pressure}} of the contact area, which varies with the radius of the dome on the anvil wheel and the <b>pressure</b> of the <b>adjusting</b> <b>screw,</b> {{and the number of}} wheeling passes determines {{the degree to which the}} material stretches. Some operators prefer a foot adjuster so they can maintain constant pressure over varying sheet metal thickness for smoothing, with both hands free to manipulate the work piece. This style of adjuster is also helpful for blending the edge of high crown areas that are thinner, with low crown areas that are relatively unstretched. A drawback of the foot adjuster is that it can get in the way of very longitudinally curved panels, such as the cycle type mudguards (wings/fenders) used on motorcycles, pre-WW2 sports cars, and current open-wheeled cars like the Lotus / Caterham 7.|$|R

50|$|The ink {{fountain}} holds {{a pool of}} ink and controls the amount of ink that enters the inking system. The {{most common type of}} fountain consists of a metal blade that is held in place near the fountain roller. The gap between the blade and the {{ink fountain}} roller can be controlled by <b>adjusting</b> <b>screw</b> keys to vary the amount of ink on the fountain roller. The printer adjusts the keys in or out as the ink fountain roller turns to obtain the desired quantity of ink. In simple presses, the printer must turn these screws by hand. In modern presses, the <b>adjusting</b> <b>screws</b> are moved by servomotors which are controlled by the printer at a press console. Thus the printer can make ink adjustments electronically. If the printer needs to increase or decrease ink in an area of the plate (print), he need only adjust the needed keys to allow more or less ink flow through the blade. The ink flow can also be controlled by the rotation velocity of the ink fountain roller.|$|R
