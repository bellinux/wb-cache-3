Human footprints include a set left by dancing women from a <b>place</b> <b>called</b> Aileron; another shows a family group travelling to a <b>place</b> <b>called</b> Ngama, and a third trail is that of a Tjungurrayi man, which lead to his skeleton, representing his death after committing the crime of trying to steal sacred items. Animal representations include tracks of a cluster of emus from a <b>place</b> <b>called</b> Napperby, on the artist's country, as well as those left by the rock wallaby, or Mala, men journeying north from Port Augusta in South Australia, as well as, on the left hand edge of the picture, those of two groups of dingoes going to a <b>place</b> <b>called</b> Warrabri. A little closer to the centre of the painting are marks representing a dreaming called the Chase of the Goanna Men. Throughout the work, Upambura the Possum Man's footsteps follow the wandering lines that give the painting its overall structure.|$|E

5|$|Mangalore's {{historical}} {{importance is}} {{highlighted by the}} many references to the city by foreign travellers. During the first century CE, Pliny the Elder, a Roman historian, made references to a <b>place</b> <b>called</b> Nitrias, as a very undesirable place for disembarkation, {{on account of the}} pirates which frequent its vicinity, while Greek historian Ptolemy in the second century CE referred to a <b>place</b> <b>called</b> Nitra. Ptolemy's and Pliny the Elder's references were probably made to the Netravati River, which flows through Mangalore. Cosmas Indicopleustes, a Greek monk, in his 6th century work Christian Topography mentions Malabar as the chief seat of the pepper trade, and Mangarouth (port of Mangalore) as one of the five pepper marts which exported pepper.|$|E

The Greek writer of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea referred to a <b>place</b> <b>called</b> Baraca, which has been interpreted as present-day Dwarka.

5|$|In summer 727, another {{large-scale}} invasion {{was led by}} Mu'awiya, with Abdallah al-Battal {{heading the}} vanguard of the army. The Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor claims that the vanguard alone numbered 15,000 men and the entire invasion force 100,000, clearly a grossly inflated number. Theophanes also records a certain Amr as Mu'awiya's second-in-command, but Arab sources are unambiguous in this regard. The Arab army moved west into northwestern Asia Minor, and the vanguard under al-Battal attacked and sacked the town of Gangra in Paphlagonia and a <b>place</b> <b>called</b> in Arab sources Tabya, possibly the fort of Ateous in Phrygia. Gangra was razed to the ground, but during the attack on Tabya the Arabs, especially the Antiochene contingent, are said to have suffered heavy losses.|$|E

The Meccans retired for the evening at a <b>place</b> <b>called</b> Hamra al-Asad, {{a few miles away}} from Medina. The next morning, Muhammad sent out a small force to harass the Meccan army on their way home. According to Watt, this was because Muhammad realized that a show of force was required to speed the Meccans away from Medinan territory. The Meccans, not wanting to be perceived as being chased away, remained nearby for a few days before leaving.|$|E

On 19 June he was taken to a <b>place</b> <b>called</b> Blacklow Hillon Lancaster's landsand decapitated. According to the Annales Londonienses chronicle, four shoemakers brought the corpse back to Warwick, but he refused to accept it, and ordered them to take it back to where they found it. Gaveston's body was eventually taken to Oxford by some Dominican friars, and in 1315, King Edward finally had it buried at Kings Langley.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} of Taman Sari commenced {{during the reign}} of Sultan Hamengkubuwono I (1755–1792), the first sultan of the Yogyakarta Sultanate, and was completed by the time of Sultan Hamengkubuwono II. The building site, however, had already been known as a bathing <b>place</b> <b>called</b> Pacethokan Spring since Sunan Amangkurat IV’s reign (1719–1726). According to Kitab Mamana in Yogyakarta Kraton, the project leader for the construction of Taman Sari was Tumenggung Mangundipura.
