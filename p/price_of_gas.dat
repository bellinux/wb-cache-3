2500|$|The {{price of}} natural gas varies greatly {{depending}} on location and type of consumer. In 2007, a price of $7 per 1000 cubic feet (about 25 cents per m3) was typical in the United States. The typical caloric value {{of natural gas}} is roughly 1,000 British thermal units (BTU) per cubic foot, depending on gas composition. This corresponds to around $7 per million BTU, or around $7 per gigajoule. In April 2008, the wholesale price was $10 per [...] ($10/MMBTU). The residential price varies from 50% to 300% more than the wholesale price. At the end of 2007, this was $12–$16 per 1000 cubic feet (about 50 cents per m3). Natural gas in the United States is traded as a futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Each contract is for 10,000MMBTU (~10,550 gigajoules), or 10 billion BTU. Thus, if the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> is $10 per million BTUs on the NYMEX, the contract is worth $100,000.|$|E

40|$|This article {{develops}} a formal model for comparing the cost {{structure of the}} two main transport options for natural gas: liquefied natural gas (LNG) and pipelines. In particular, it evaluates how vari-ations in the <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>gas</b> and greenhouse gas emissions affect the relative cost-efficiency of these two options. Natural gas is often promoted as the most environmentally friendly of all fossil fuels, and LNG as a modern and efficient way of transporting it. Some research {{has been carried out}} into the local environmental impact of LNG facilities, but almost none into aspects related to climate change. This paper concludes that at current price levels for natural gas and CO 2 emissions the distance from field to consumer and the volume <b>of</b> natural <b>gas</b> transported are the main determinants of transport costs. The <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>gas</b> and greenhouse emissions influence the relative cost-efficiency of LNG and pipeline transport, but only to a limited degree at current price levels. Because more energy is required for the LNG process (especially for fuelling the liquefaction process) than for pipelines at distances below 9100 km, LNG is more exposed to variability in the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>gas</b> and greenhouse gas emissions up to this distance. If the <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>gas</b> and/or greenhouse gas emission rise dramatically in the future, this will affect the choice between pipelines and LNG. Such a price increase will be favourable for pipelines relative to LNG...|$|R
