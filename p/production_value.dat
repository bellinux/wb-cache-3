Since this method did not yield the results which they were expecting, Sire Records contacted the producers of 1978's Road to Ruin: Ed Stasium and ex-band member Tommy Ramone. Too Tough to Die has less <b>production</b> <b>value</b> than previous recordings by the Ramones. Because critics often disapproved of the sound quality on End of the Century and Pleasant Dreams, the band leaned towards a harsher sound.|$|E

It became the only single in 2002 the same year to sell over one million units in Japan, and was certified by the Recording Industry Association of Japan for one million copies shipped to stores.|$|E

5|$|End of the Century is {{the fifth}} studio album by the American punk rock band the Ramones, {{released}} on February 4, 1980, through Sire Records. The album was the band's first produced by Phil Spector, though he had offered the band his assistance earlier in their career. With Spector fully producing the album, {{it was the first}} release that excluded original member Tommy Ramone, who in 1978 left the band but produced their previous album Road to Ruin. Spector used more advanced standards of engineering, such as high-quality overdubbing and echo chambers. These methods caused conflict between the band and Spector since much of the recording used techniques that opposed those the Ramones had previously used. Spector emphasized the <b>production</b> <b>value</b> as well, working with a budget of around $200,000.|$|E
5|$|Leave Home is {{the second}} studio album by American punk rock band the Ramones. It was {{released}} on January 10, 1977, through Sire Records, with the expanded CD being released through Rhino Entertainment on June 19, 2001. Songs on the album were written immediately after the band's first album's writing process, which demonstrated the band's progression. The album had a higher <b>production</b> <b>value</b> than their debut Ramones and featured faster tempos. The front photo was taken by Moshe Brakha and the back cover, which would become the band's logo, was designed by Arturo Vega. The album spawned three singles, but only one succeeded in charting. It was also promoted with several tour dates in the United States and Europe.|$|E

5|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album began on May 1, 1979 at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles. Gold Star Studios had become famous through its history with artists like Eddie Cochran and the Beach Boys. At the Ramones' request, Ed Stasium {{helped with the}} album's engineering. During the studio work, Spector's recording methods were different from those the Ramones were accustomed to from their four previous studio albums. The band recorded their earlier compositions in the shortest time possible for the lowest feasible budget, with a relatively low <b>production</b> <b>value.</b> With End of the Century, the band experienced Spector's infamous perfectionism, and a budget of $200,000 to fully record and produce the album. This is significant because the band's debut album cost $6,400 total, and their second album cost $10,000. End of the Century {{is the most expensive}} album in the Ramones' career.|$|E
5|$|Still {{photographs}} of Oheka Castle in Huntington, New York, {{were used in}} the opening montage, representing Kane's Xanadu estate. Ferguson also designed statues from Kane's collection with styles ranging from Greek to German Gothic. The sets were also built to accommodate Toland's camera movements. Walls were built to fold and furniture could quickly be moved. The film's famous ceilings were made out of muslin fabric and camera boxes were built into the floors for low angle shots. Welles later said that he was proud that the film <b>production</b> <b>value</b> looked much more expensive than the film's budget. Although neither worked with Welles again, Toland and Ferguson collaborated in several films in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|The Suffer & the Witness was {{released}} on July 4, 2006. The album sold 48,327 copies in its first week of release in the United States, and peaked at number ten on the Billboard 200. The Sufferer & the Witness also charted in seven other countries, including number five on the Canadian Albums Chart, making it the band's first album to chart outside of the United States. It was certified gold in three countries, and platinum by Music Canada. The album was well received by critics, who praised the <b>production</b> <b>value,</b> and noted how Rise Against was able to mature in their sound and simultaneously retain their punk roots.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to empirically {{examine the}} antecedents of film tourism {{experience}} {{associated with a}} serialized TV drama. Drawing on film tourism and media-communication studies, a theoretical model for the causal interrelationship between <b>production</b> <b>values</b> of the TV drama, audience involvement with it, and film tourism experience at its filmed location was tested empirically using structural equation modeling (SEM) methodologies. Responses were drawn from a cross-sectional data sample of international visitors via a survey executed at Daejanggeum Theme Park in Korea. The results indicate that <b>production</b> <b>values</b> and audience involvement have a direct, positive impact on film tourism experience. Moreover, the <b>production</b> <b>values</b> have a mediating, positive impact on film tourism experience through the audience involvement construct. PublishedN/...|$|R

5|$|The {{two major}} Limousin hybrids are Brahmousin (a cross between Brahman and Limousin cattle)) and Lim-Flex (a cross between Angus and Limousin cattle), which were both {{developed}} before {{the significance of}} the F94L myostatin variant had been quantified. When Limousins homozygous for the F94L myostatin mutation are used in crossbreeding, only one of the mutations will be inherited (that is, progeny will be heterozygous for the mutation), and a high level of phenotypic uniformity and hybrid vigour would be expected in the progeny. However, breeding using heterozygous animals as parents, which could include purebred Limousins of low percentage Full French content, and Lim-Flex and Brahmousin hybrids that have not been bred to a uniform (homozygous) standard over several generations, would produce progeny with inconsistent carcase characteristics and <b>production</b> <b>value</b> depending upon whether or not the F94L mutation was inherited.|$|E
5|$|Within the Woods {{was later}} {{retooled}} by Raimi with a vastly higher <b>production</b> <b>value</b> and a full-length running {{time as the}} 1981 film The Evil Dead.

A remake, known as Evil Dead, was released in 2013 with Raimi and Campbell as producers and creative consultants. In 2015, the Starz television network began airing the ongoing comedy horror series Ash vs Evil Dead, which features Bruce Campbell returning as an older Ash Williams.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the film}} went into production, the {{decision}} to shoot in Vancouver, rather than in Portland, came after debate on how to match the locations that were introduced in the first film. One member involved in the decision process pointed out that Vancouver had been scouted as a potential setting for Twilight, {{and it was only}} because the U.S. dollar had, at that time, dropped below the Canadian dollar that Oregon drew Twilight principal photography to Portland and its surrounding areas. Vancouver was chosen because it allowed a higher <b>production</b> <b>value,</b> while the surrounding areas contained beautiful forests and gray weather. With this decision, however, came the issue of reconstructing key sets that were used in the first film. For the exterior of Forks High School, crew members were able to find a parking lot, but the school's steps needed to be filmed with a greenscreen backing to match those that were originally presented in Twilight. David Thompson Secondary School would then be able to serve as the interior for the high school scenes.|$|E
