30|$|The {{behavior}} of the two considered scheduling algorithms {{can be observed in}} the top-right side of Figures 18 and 19. These graphs show the number of Transmission Time Intervals (TTIs), measured over 10 [*]TTI/ 20 [*]ms periods, that the UUT requests a transmission (blue line), and the number of times that these requests are accepted by the scheduler (green line) or rejected (red line). As it is expected, the MaxC/I behavior is highly dependent on the experienced channel quality: under favorable channel quality conditions all UUT's requests are accepted, while several requests are rejected when the UUT is at the cell border (time instants around 65 and 195 seconds). On the other hand, the RR policy exhibits a more homogeneous and channel-independent pattern, with an average of around 80 % transmission requests accepted (20 % rejected) under both favorable and unfavorable channel quality conditions. This behavior is also observed in the number of physical channel codes, that is, High-Speed <b>Physical</b> <b>Downlink</b> <b>Shared</b> <b>Channels</b> (HS-PDSCHs), which the scheduler assigns to the UUT, which is shown in the bottom-right side of Figures 18 and 19 (measured over 10 TTI/ 20 [*]ms periods). At the cell border, the number of HS-PDSCHs assigned to the UUT is limited by the maximum number of HS-PDSCHs corresponding to the reported CQI value. As a result, a low number of HS-PDSCHs is assigned to the UUT in time instants around 65 and 195 seconds with both MaxC/I and RR. On the other hand, under good channel quality conditions, data transmissions can be reliably performed using the maximum number of simultaneous codes allowed by UE's HSDPA category (5 codes for category 12). In this case, the main aspect limiting the number of HS-PDSCHs assigned to the UUT is the scheduler's policy. As it can be observed for RR under good channel quality conditions, the UUT is hardly assigned up to 40 codes every 10 [*]TTIs, that is, 4 codes per TTI in average. On the other hand, the value of this parameter for MaxC/I under similar channel quality conditions usually reaches the average of 5 codes per TTI. This {{is due to the fact}} that users experiencing favorable channel conditions tend to monopolize resources when the MaxC/I algorithm is applied.|$|R

30|$|For the 4 G Long Term Evolution (LTE) network, its {{physical}} layer {{is based on}} orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with a cyclic prefix (CP) in the downlink [18]. Cell-specific reference signals (CRS) are equivalent to training sequence in 2 / 3 G network. CRS are transmitted in all downlink subframes in a cell supporting <b>Physical</b> <b>Downlink</b> <b>Shared</b> <b>Channel</b> (PDSCH) transmission [19], which have a fixed position in time domain and frequency domain. Therefore, the reference symbol (RS) received power (RSRP) and signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of the co-channel signals from different cells could be distinguished and measured by parallel detection of the CRS based on timeslot, which provides a scientific and efficient measurement means for the interference and coverage analysis and their optimization in LTE cellular radio network.|$|E
30|$|In {{the current}} study, we {{consider}} a 5 -MHz transmission bandwidth with a sampling frequency of 7.68 MHz and a transform size of 512 (15 -kHz sub-carrier separation).

The transmission is divided into subframes of 14 MC symbols in CP-OFDM and 15 MC symbols in FBMC, since the time dedicated to the CP in OFDM can be dedicated to another MC symbol in FBMC. The minimum resource allocation in the frequency domain occupies 12 sub-carriers, like an LTE physical resource block (PRB).

30|$|The basic {{principle}} of the HSDPA is to adapt the link to the instantaneous radio channel condition using adaptive modulation and coding (AMC). HSDPA employs a <b>shared</b> <b>channel,</b> the High-Speed <b>Downlink</b> <b>Shared</b> <b>channel</b> (HS-DSCH), which is used by all HSDPA users. With a <b>shared</b> <b>channel,</b> radio resources are occupied only if a transmission occurs, which enables a more efficient transport of bursty traffic. In each transport time interval (TTI), the scheduler located in the NodeB decides about the users to be scheduled and about their data rate. The scheduling decision can be either on behalf of channel quality indicator (CQI) reports from the user equipments (UE) to enable opportunistic scheduling schemes which use the air interface more efficiently, or simple nonopportunistic schemes like round-robin can be used which shares the resources time fair among the users.|$|R

30|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that similar {{features}} have been introduced for HSDPA and HSUPA, there are several essential differences [2]. In case of HSDPA the High Speed <b>Downlink</b> <b>Shared</b> <b>Channel</b> (HS-DSCH) is <b>shared</b> in time domain among all users, for HSUPA the E-DCH is dedicated to a user. For HSDPA, the transmission power is kept more or less fixed and rate adaptation is used. However, this is not possible for HSUPA since the uplink is nonorthogonal, therefore, fast power control is needed for fast link adaption. Soft handover is not supported by HSDPA, while for HSUPA soft handover is used to decrease the interference from neighboring cells and to have macrodiversity gain. Consequently, for HSDPA the shared resources are the transmission power and the code space of the <b>shared</b> <b>channel,</b> but for HSUPA, the interference headroom.|$|R

30|$|At {{the typical}} LTE network scenario, each {{connected}} User Equipment (UE) reports CQI via the uplink channel to evolved NodeB (eNB) as an estimation of its link efficiency. Thereafter, eNB may {{decide whether to}} use the reported CQI or adjusting it based on the service requirements. It {{is important to note}} that all the resources allocation and scheduling functions are managed and handled by the eNB. Thereupon, the downlink packet scheduling process is initiated after eNB receives the instantaneous CQI feedback from the involved UEs. These feedbacks are usually triggered periodically with intervals of several tens of TTIs. At the eNB side, the scheduling process takes place associated with the CQI and QoS-related parameters. For each selected PRB to UE flow, the Signal–Interference–plus–Noise–Ratio (SINR) calculated using reported UE’s CQI. Then the Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) exploits the SINR to select the proper MCS for the allocated PRB; this procedure actually ensures low channel errors during the transmission process. Using the MCS, Transport Block Size (TBS) can be decided for the UE’s payload to be carried with the allocated PRB. Information of RBs mapping, as well as the determined MCS, are reported back to the respective UE via the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH). Eventually, the UE decodes the PDCCH payload and checks if it is permitted to be scheduled by the eNB and possibly access the <b>Physical</b> <b>Downlink</b> <b>Shared</b> <b>Channel</b> (PDSCH) to receive its requested flow.|$|E
30|$|For clarity, {{the booming}} LTE network is {{employed}} as the benchmark system for following analysis. In LTE network, C-plane {{is responsible for}} essential control operations such as broadcasting system information, network attaches, paging,and mobility management [8]. Moreover, the functionality of U-plane is to forward user data flow. Definitely, without a reliable C-plane, the U-plane cannot work properly. From the perspective of air interfaces, without reliably transmitted Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) that accommodates control information to indicate ‘who’ the data are for, ‘what’ data are sent, and ‘how’ the data are sent on <b>Physical</b> <b>Downlink</b> <b>Shared</b> <b>Channel</b> (PDSCH), the user data cannot be correctly decoded. Considering the above mentioned in [9, 10], the crucial C-plane instead of U-plane is kept at dependable lower frequency bands so that the transmission reliability of C/U-plane decoupled architecture could be well guaranteed. However, the performance evaluation of this architecture has not been well studied. Actually, for such emerging network architecture, there still exist many problems to be solved to guarantee the reliable transmission. For instance, Doppler effect is always a severe challenge for high-speed railway scenario. While in the C/U-plane decoupled architecture, C-plane and U-plane of the same user are transmitted at different frequencies thereby facing different Doppler shifts and Doppler spreads. Hence, the Doppler effect may get even worse. Fortunately, railways are mostly built in wide suburban or viaduct environment where multi-paths can be neglected and the wireless channel {{can be regarded as}} LOS [4]. Thus, there almost exists no Doppler spread in high-speed railway scenario. According to [4, 6], with a known train’s location and velocity supplied by the communication-based train control (CBTC) system, it can be assumed that Doppler shifts are separately compensated for C-plane and U-plane. Hence, how to appropriately evaluate the transmission reliability of this decoupled architecture becomes an urgent problem, which will greatly impact subsequent research directions on performance enhancement.|$|E

In a wireless environment, because of the time-varying channel fluctuations of wireless links, efficient use of the large available bandwidth cannot be achieved without adopting sophisticated channel-stateaware packet scheduling strategies. To cope with this issue, many downlink packet schedulers have been developed and investigated to achieve high throughput and fair share of the link bandwidth. However, handling all situations by simply applying specific schemes is impossible, and, therefore, more than one scheduler may have to be implemented and selectively employed in a base station. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for downlink packet schedulers to integrate these existing schedulers into a unified form, and evaluate the basic performance by carrying out simulations...|$|R
