50|$|A ‘card shield’ would {{grab the}} punched card {{to hold it}} in place and lower it a {{position}} almost touching the inked <b>print</b> <b>ribbon</b> and print wheel. At the correct time 60 ‘hammers’, under spring tension and controlled by a cam, would ‘fire’ pressing the card / inked ribbon onto the print wheel and leaving an inked impression of the character {{on the surface of the}} punched card. There is a blank space on the print wheel for non-printing columns.|$|E
40|$|Laser direct-writing {{provides}} {{a method to}} pattern living cells in vitro, to study various cell–cell interactions, and to build cellular constructs. However, the materials typically used may limit its long-term application. By utilizing gelatin coatings on the <b>print</b> <b>ribbon</b> and growth surface, we developed a new approach for laser cell printing that overcomes the limitations of Matrigel™. Gelatin is free of growth factors and extraneous matrix components that may interfere with cellular processes under investigation. Gelatin-based laser direct-write was able to successfully pattern human dermal fibroblasts with high post-transfer viability (91 %[*]±[*] 3 %) and no observed double-strand DNA damage. As seen with atomic force microscopy, gelatin offers a unique benefit {{in that it is}} present temporarily to allow cell transfer, but melts and is removed with incubation to reveal the desired application-specific growth surface. This provides unobstructed cellular growth after printing. Monitoring cell location after transfer, we show that melting and removal of gelatin does not affect cellular placement; cells maintained registry within 5. 6 [*]±[*] 2. 5 [*]μm to the initial pattern. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of gelatin in laser direct-writing to create spatially precise cell patterns with the potential for applications in tissue engineering, stem cell, and cancer research...|$|E
50|$|Award ribbons can {{be simply}} a flat piece of ribbon, a flat-folded ribbon, or fancier {{manipulations}} of the ribbon material, such as rosettes. A rosette consists of ribbon that is pleated or gathered and {{arranged in a}} circle so that it resembles a rose, usually with streamer ribbons attached. Some ribbon rosettes will also have loops, petals and star points {{as part of the}} design whilst using Satin ribbons, Velvet ribbons, Sheer ribbons, Lamé ribbons, Tartan <b>ribbons</b> and <b>printed</b> <b>ribbons</b> including personalised <b>printed</b> <b>ribbons</b> to promote the sponsor, event or the reason for giving.|$|R
50|$|The company {{manufactures}} cotton-filled paper boxes {{as well as}} poly bags, paper bags, reusable bags, and {{a variety}} of <b>printed</b> <b>ribbon,</b> seals and packaging accessories. Gunther Mele has been an early adopter of environmentally friendly packaging, licensing TDPA oxo-biodegradable technology from epi-global and utilizing FSC approved suppliers of papers for it shopping bags. Reusable non-woven fabric style bags have become a major category for Gunther Mele.|$|R
50|$|International {{franchise}} {{owners in}} franchise locations overseas sometimes design their own cookie bags <b>printed</b> with 3D <b>ribbons.</b>|$|R
50|$|More {{complex is}} thermal {{transfer}} printing that melts <b>print</b> off a <b>ribbon</b> and onto the sheet of paper.|$|R
50|$|A {{typewriter}} ribbon or {{ink ribbon}} is an expendable module serving {{the function of}} transferring pigment to paper in various devices for impact <b>printing.</b> Such <b>ribbons</b> were part of standard designs for hand- or motor-driven typewriters, teleprinters, stenotype machines, computer-driven printers and many mechanical calculators, before electronic alternatives replaced most of them.|$|R

50|$|Rice {{bran wax}} is edible and {{can serve as}} a {{substitute}} for carnauba wax in most applications due to its relatively high melting point. It is used in paper coatings, textiles, explosives, fruit & vegetable coatings, confectionery, pharmaceuticals, candles, moulded novelties, electric insulation, textile and leather sizing, waterproofing, carbon paper, typewriter <b>ribbons,</b> <b>printing</b> inks, lubricants, crayons, adhesives, chewing gum and cosmetics.|$|R
50|$|The school badge was {{designed}} by a Mr Watambwa {{who was one of}} the artisans involved in the construction of the college in 1960. The badge depicts a shield with a cross on it with two spears running down across at slanted angle. A martyr's crown sits atop the cross. The college's motto is <b>printed</b> on a <b>ribbon</b> below the shield.|$|R
50|$|Thermal {{transfer}} printing is {{a digital}} printing {{process in which}} material is applied to paper (or some other material) by melting a coating of ribbon so that it stays glued to the material on which the print is applied. It contrasts with direct thermal <b>printing</b> where no <b>ribbon</b> {{is present in the}} process. It was invented by SATO corporation. The world's first thermal transfer label printer SATO M-2311 was produced in 1981.|$|R

5000|$|The yellow {{ribbon saw}} renewed {{popularity}} in the United States during the Gulf War in the early 1990s. It appeared along with the slogan [...] "support our troops", {{in the form of}} yellow ribbons tied to trees, and countless other contexts. It often had the implied meaning of [...] "bring our troops home" [...] from the Desert Shield and Desert Storm troop deployments. It appeared again during the 2003 invasion of Iraq with similar meanings, most prominently {{in the form of a}} yellow <b>ribbon</b> <b>printed</b> on magnetized material and displayed on the outside of automobiles.|$|R
6000|$|Your Cromwell, {{what good}} could it do {{him to be}} [...] "noticed" [...] by noisy crowds of people? God his Maker already noticed him. He, Cromwell, was already there; no notice would make him other than he already was. Till his hair was grown gray; and Life from the down-hill slope was all seen to be limited, not {{infinite}} but finite, and all a measurable matter how it went,--he had been content to plough the ground, and read his Bible. He in his old days could not support it any longer, without selling himself to Falsehood, that he might ride in gilt carriages to Whitehall, and have clerks with bundles of papers haunting him, [...] "Decide this, decide that," [...] which in utmost sorrow of heart no man can perfectly decide! What could gilt carriages do for this man? From of old, was there not in his life a weight of meaning, a terror and a splendor as of Heaven itself? His existence there as man set him beyond the need of gilding. Death, Judgment and Eternity: these already lay as the background of whatsoever he thought or did. All his life lay begirt as {{in a sea of}} nameless Thoughts, which no speech of a mortal could name. God's Word, as the Puritan prophets of that time had read it: this was great, and all else was little to him. To call such a man [...] "ambitious," [...] to figure him as the prurient wind-bag described above, seems to me the poorest solecism. Such a man will say: [...] "Keep your gilt carriages and huzzaing mobs, keep your red-tape clerks, your influentialities, your important businesses. Leave me alone, leave me alone; there is too much of life in me already!" [...] Old Samuel Johnson, the greatest soul in England in his day, was not ambitious. [...] "Corsica Boswell" [...] flaunted at public shows with <b>printed</b> <b>ribbons</b> round his hat; but the great old Samuel stayed at home. The world-wide soul wrapt up in its thoughts, in its sorrows;--what could paradings, and ribbons in the hat, do for it? ...|$|R
