5|$|MD7 {{begins at}} the {{entrance}} to the Perry Point VA Medical Center just north and east of the Amtrak Susquehanna River Bridge adjacent to Rodgers Tavern in the town of Perryville. The highway heads east as municipally maintained Broad Street, passing under both railroad tracks of the wye of Norfolk Southern Railway's Columbia & Port Deposit line with the Amtrak Northeast Corridor, within which is the Perryville MARC station. Maintenance responsibility transfers from the town of Perryville to the state at MD222 (Aiken Avenue). MD 7 heads east over Mill Creek, past MD327 (Ikea Way), and leaves the town limits after an intersection with Coudon Boulevard, which leads to US40. The route continues east as <b>Principio</b> Furnace Road through farmland, passing the historic home Woodlands and Furnace Bay Golf Course. MD7 passes the remains of <b>Principio</b> Furnace and crosses <b>Principio</b> Creek before reaching its eastern terminus at US40.|$|E

25|$|As for a {{sequence}} nominative-genitive, {{it may be}} the norm in Latin in a similar ratio. E.g. “Systema Naturae”. Indeed, the sequence nominative-genitive must always be the norm in Peano’s Interlingua, since the preposition de must introduce the genitive. Thus, Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica would turn into <b>Principio</b> Mathematico de Philosophia Naturale. Since the function of both the adjective and the genitive is often the same, one might infer that the sequence noun-adjective might always be the norm.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival in America, John Read {{purchased}} a large landed estate in Cecil County, Maryland, and founded, with six associates, the city of Charlestown, on the headwaters of Chesapeake Bay, twelve years after Baltimore was begun, {{with the intention of}} creating a new market for the northern trade, and thus developing northern Maryland and building up the neighboring iron works of the <b>Principio</b> Company, in which the older generations of the Washington family, and at a later period General George Washington himself, were also largely interested.|$|E
25|$|A {{division}} of boats then rowed upriver to the Cecil or <b>Principio</b> Foundry, {{three or four}} miles to the north. They destroyed the buildings, machinery and guns they found there, as well as five vessels and a large store of flour. They returned to the ships by 10 p.m. after being away for twenty-two hours. The only casualty was Lieutenant Westphal, first of the Marlborough, who had received a shot through the hand. The gallantry, zeal and attention of Captain Lawrence was particularly mentioned in the Admiral's official letter, as was the behaviour of Lieutenant Reed of Fantome.|$|E

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As {{it was in the}} beginning, both now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen. Alleluia.) From Septuagesima until Easter, Laus tibi Domine, Rex aeternae gloriae (Praise be to Thee O Lord, King of eternal glory) replaces Alleluia.|$|E

Kennedy Memorial Highway). The highway starts east as Reservoir Road but immediately turns north along two-lane Blythedale Road. After passing under I-95 and intersecting <b>Principio</b> Road {{in the valley}} of Mill Creek, MD 824 curves to the west toward its northern terminus at a four-way intersection with MD 222 and MD 275. MD 222 heads south toward the I-95 interchange as Perryville Road and west as Bainbridge Road toward Port Deposit, and MD 275 and MD 222 Truck head north as Perrylawn Drive toward Rising Sun.|$|E
25|$|In April 1661 he {{enrolled}} in his father's former university at age 15, and completed his bachelor's degree in Philosophy in December 1662. He defended his Disputatio Metaphysica de <b>Principio</b> Individui (Metaphysical Disputation on the Principle of Individuation), which addressed the principle of individuation, on 9 June 1663. Leibniz earned his master's degree in Philosophy on 7 February 1664. He published and defended a dissertation Specimen Quaestionum Philosophicarum ex Jure collectarum (An Essay of Collected Philosophical Problems of Right), arguing for both a theoretical and a pedagogical relationship between philosophy and law, in December 1664. After one year of legal studies, he was awarded his bachelor's degree in Law on 28 September 1665. His dissertation was titled De conditionibus (On Conditions).|$|E
25|$|MD 274 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD 273 (Main Street) {{in the town}} center of Rising Sun. The highway follows two-lane Queen Street south to the town limit, where the route intersects the Octoraro Rail Trail, where the highway continues southeast as Joseph Biggs Memorial Highway. The highway was named for Joseph B. Biggs, a county commissioner of Cecil County in the 1970s. MD 274 follows the ridge separating North East Creek to the northeast from <b>Principio</b> Creek and Stony Run to the southwest. The highway passes through the hamlets of Farmington and Greenhurst. In the latter hamlet, MD 274 intersects Calvert Road and parallels Ebenezer Church Road; the parallel segments of these roads are MD 274A and MD 274B.

There, MD 274 reaches its eastern terminus at MD 272 (North East Road) across from the entrance to Cecil College and a short distance north of MD 272's interchange with I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway).|$|E

500|$|When the Maryland State Roads Commission {{laid out}} a {{proposed}} state road system in 1909, two sections of the Philadelphia Road were included: from the eastern city limit of Baltimore, then at Elwood Avenue, east to Rossville in Baltimore County, and from Perryville to Elkton. The highway was paved as an [...] wide tarred macadam road from Elwood Avenue to Herring Run in 1910. The remainder of the road from Herring Run to Rossville was completed in concrete by 1921. In Cecil County, the Philadelphia Road was paved with a [...] wide macadam surface from the eastern town limit of North East to the western town limit of Elkton in 1913. The highway was paved in concrete from Perryville to <b>Principio</b> Creek and in macadam from there through Charlestown in 1914. The state road was paved in macadam from Charlestown to North East, including Cecil Avenue within the latter, in 1915. The section of the state road through Charlestown, which is now MD267, was bypassed with a concrete road that remained {{on the north side}} of the Pennsylvania Railroad by 1921.|$|E
500|$|Primary sources {{about the}} battle of Ollantaytambo were written mainly by Spaniards. Pedro Pizarro, a cousin of Francisco Pizarro, {{was part of the}} {{expedition}} against Manco Inca's headquarters. Years later he wrote down his recollections of these and other events in a chronicle called Relación del descubrimiento y conquista de los reinos del Perú, completed in 1571. The anonymous Relación del sitio del Cuzco y <b>principio</b> de las guerras civiles del Perú hasta la muerte de Diego de Almagro starts in January 1536 [...] when Hernando Pizarro arrived in Cusco, and ends with the execution of Diego de Almagro in July 1538. This chronicle, which includes an account of Manco Inca's rebellion and the attack on Ollantaytambo, was written in 1539 probably by Diego de Silva, a Spanish soldier who was actually in Lima during the uprising. An account of the battle was also included in the Historia general de los hechos de los Castellanos en las islas y tierra firme del Mar Oceano [...] written by Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas between 1610 and 1615. Herrera was the Cronista Mayor de las Indias (Chronicler-in-Chief of the Indies) of the Spanish Crown and despite writing in Madrid, had access to many documents and sources. On the Inca side, the only written account of the battle is included in the Relación de la conquista del Perú y hechos del Inca Manco II written in 1570 by Titu Cusi Yupanqui, son of Manco Inca.|$|E
