With the restricted FOV, the pilots reported reduced ground track precision owing to loss of visual contact with the course markers. However, the predictable ground track of the repeated S-turn task with no obstacles made it easy for them to anticipate their maneuvers, and resulted in only a slight degradation of pilot ratings. This degradation was not sensitive to large changes in helicopter flying qualities...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{effect of}} speed {{stability}} on pilot workload and accuracy on the {{approach has been}} investigated with the Avro 707 A research aircraft. Speed instability was simulated by a reversed autothrottle which applied thrust in response to changes in airspeed, or in airspeed and incidence.

The pilot's throttle usage, however, varied consistently with the speed stability time constant, and was little affected by the type of talkdown control used. Marked changes in throttle usage corresponded well with <b>pilots</b> <b>assessments</b> of the difficulty of the task.

40|$|Measures of pilot {{situation}} awareness (SA) {{are needed in}} order to know whether new concepts in display design help pilots keep track of rapidly changing tactical situations. In order to measure SA, a theory of situation assessment is needed. Such a theory is summarized, encompassing both a definition of SA and a model of situation assessment. SA is defined as the pilot's knowledge about a zone of interest at a given level of abstraction. Pilots develop this knowledge by sampling data from the environment and matching the sampled data to knowledge structures stored in long-term memory. Matched knowledge structures then provide the <b>pilot's</b> <b>assessment</b> of the situation and serve to guide his attention.

40|$|In recent years, {{terms as}} “knowledge economy” and “knowledge society” have {{appeared}} in contemporary management literature. The rhetoric has been that technology-based advantages alone are transient and that knowledge is the reason companies are able to gain and sustain competitive advantages. This has led to extensive research, and knowledge management has gained the reputation of a legitimate research field. This thesis aims at proposing a feasible approach and tool for an initial knowledge management assessment, using {{the case of an}} electronics manufacturer in South East China. By an extensive literature review and analyzing reasoning, a knowledge management assessment tool has been developed through a combination of a well-known model for knowledge creation and a globally wide-spread set of criteria for knowledge management. A <b>pilot</b> <b>assessment,</b> conducted to evaluate a management process in the case company, proved the assessment tool applicable. In that <b>pilot</b> <b>assessment,</b> it was shown that all stages of the dynamic knowledge creation process were supported to some extent even though {{there was a lack of}} support for some categories in the evaluation criteria. The trial evaluation is however to be viewed as successful since the assessment tool was proven to serve its purpose. The assessed process at the case company was considered to contribute a great deal to the department’s and organization’s knowledge management performance. Geographic location or maturity of knowledge management is not regarded to have any significant influence and the proposed assessment tool is considered as useful to various organizations, thus enjoying a high external validity...|$|E

40|$|From {{wake vortex}} {{velocity}} distribution models the velocity field induced by vortices can be quantified. The {{effect on a}} following aircraft that flies into this field ('encounters the wake vortex') can then be derived from flight mechanical calculations in an offline simulation or from flight simulator studies with a pilot-in-the-loop.

The wake vortex velocity field models and the aerodynamic interaction models (AIM) used in these studies have been validated against wind tunnel and flight tests.
