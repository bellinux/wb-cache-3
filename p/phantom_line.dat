40|$|We {{investigate}} the generalized Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) ghost model of {{dark energy in}} the framework of Einstein gravity. First, we study the non-interacting generalized ghost dark energy in a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) background. We obtain the equation of state parameter, w_D=p/ρ, the deceleration parameter, and the evolution equation of the generalized ghost dark energy. We find that, in this case, w_D cannot cross the <b>phantom</b> <b>line</b> (w_D>- 1) and eventually the universe approaches a de-Sitter phase of expansion (w_D→- 1). Then, we extend the study to the interacting ghost dark energy in both a flat and non-flat FRW universe. We find that the equation of state parameter of the interacting generalized ghost dark energy can cross the <b>phantom</b> <b>line</b> (w_D<- 1) provided the parameters of the model are chosen suitably.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel cache design, Phantom Associative Cache (PAC), that alleviates cache {{thrashing}} in L 2 caches {{by keeping the}} in-cache data blocks for a longer time period. To realize PAC, we introduce the concept of phantom lines. A <b>phantom</b> <b>line</b> works like a real cache line in the LRU stack but does not hold any data or tag. When a <b>phantom</b> <b>line</b> is selected for replacement, cache bypassing is performed instead of replacement. By using appropriate number of phantom lines, PAC can always keep the data blocks that show stronger locality longer in the cache and bypass the cache for other blocks. We show that PAC can be implemented reasonably in practice. The experimental results show that on average PAC reduces cache misses by 17. 95 % for twelve CPU 2006 benchmarks with Misses Per Kilo-Instruction (MPKI) larger than 1 and by 6. 61 % for all CPU 2006 and PARSEC benchmarks. With the help of compiler hints, PAC can further reduce cache misses by 22 % for benchmarks that have relatively high MPKI or miss rate. ...|$|E
40|$|Regarding the Veneziano {{ghost of}} QCD and its {{generalized}} form, we consider a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe filled by a pressureless matter {{and a dark}} energy component interacting with each other through a mutual sign-changeable interaction of positive coupling constant. Our study shows that, at the late time, for the deceleration parameter we have q→- 1, while the equation of state parameter of the interacting ghost dark energy (GDE) does not cross the <b>phantom</b> <b>line,</b> namely ω_D≥- 1. We also extend our study to the generalized ghost dark energy (GGDE) model and show that, at late time, the equation of state parameter of the interacting GGDE also respects the <b>phantom</b> <b>line</b> in both flat and non-flat universes. Moreover, we find out that, unlike the non-flat universe, we have q→- 1 at late time for flat FRW universe. In {{order to make the}} behavior of the underlying models more clear, the deceleration parameter q as well as the equation of state parameter w_D for flat and closed universes have been plotted against the redshift parameter, z. All of the studied cases admit a transition in the expansion history of universe from a deceleration phase to an accelerated one around z≈ 0. 6 Comment: 15 pages, 16 figure...|$|E

40|$|We {{construct}} a dark energy model where a scalar field non-minimally coupled to gravity {{plays the role}} of the dark component. We compare cosmological consequences of this non-minimal coupling of the scalar field and gravity {{in the spirit of the}} dark energy paradigm in Jordan and Einstein frames. Some important issues such as <b>phantom</b> divide <b>line</b> crossing, existence of the bouncing solutions and the stability of the solutions are compared in these two frames. We show that while a non-minimally coupled scalar field in the Jordan frame is a suitable dark energy component with capability to realize <b>phantom</b> divide <b>line</b> crossing, its conformal transformation in the Einstein frame has not this capability. The conformal transformation from Jordan frame to Einstein frame transforms the equation of state parameter of the dark energy component to its minimal form with a redefined scalar field and in this case it is impossible to realize a phantom phase with possible crossing of the <b>phantom</b> divide <b>line.</b> Comment: 14 pages, Accepted for Publication in MPL...|$|R

40|$|We use three IR cutoffs, {{including}} the future event horizon, the Hubble and Granda-Oliveros (GO) cutoffs, to construct three holographic models of dark energy. Additionally, we consider a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe filled by a dark matter (DM) {{and a dark}} energy that {{interact with each other}} through a mutual sign-changeable interaction. Thereinafter, we address the evolution of the some cosmological parameters, such as the equation of state and dimensionless density parameters of dark energy as well as the deceleration parameter, during the cosmic evolution from the matter dominated era until the late time acceleration. We observe that a holographic dark energy (HDE) model with Hubble cutoff interacting with DM may be in line with the current universe. Our study shows that models with the future event horizon as the IR cutoff or the GO cutoff are in good agreement with the observational data. In fact, we find out that these obtained models can predict the universe transition from a deceleration phase to the acceleration one in a compatible way with observations. The three obtained models may also allow the equation of state parameter to cross the <b>phantom</b> <b>line,</b> a result which depends on the values of the system's constants such as the value of the interaction coupling constant.
