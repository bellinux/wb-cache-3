50|$|In 1944 he {{had been}} made Divisional Leader of the Physical & Tropical Testing Laboratories and the Component Group, which placed {{contracts}} with industry for new components and materials. His interest in components grew out of his experience with radar. “They were the bricks and mortar, {{and many of them}} were not as reliable as they should have been”, he said. Out of his drive for reliability came the search for new techniques and methods of construction. Together with Dr A. C. Vivian he made the first plastic <b>potted</b> <b>circuit</b> in January 1947 to protect components from shock and moisture. Printed wiring methods and etching techniques were explored, and their use encouraged in radar equipment.|$|E
50|$|When <b>potting</b> a <b>circuit</b> {{board that}} uses surface-mount technology, low glass {{transition}} temperature (Tg) potting compounds such as polyurethane or silicone are used, because high Tg potting compounds may break solder bonds as they harden and shrink at low temperatures.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Pot</b> Keyboard Integrated <b>Circuit</b> (POKEY) is {{a digital}} I/O chip {{found in the}} Atari 8-bit family of home {{computers}} and many arcade games in the 1980s. It was commonly used to sample (ADC) potentiometers (such as game paddles) and scan matrices of switches (such as a computer keyboard). POKEY is also well known for its sound effect and music generation capabilities, producing a distinctive square wave sound popular among chip tune aficionados. The LSI chip has 40 pins and is identified as C012294. POKEY was designed by Atari employee Doug Neubauer, who also programmed the original Star Raiders.|$|R
40|$|The tail-withdrawal {{circuit of}} Aplysia {{provides}} a useful model system for investigating synaptic dynamics. Sensory neurons within the circuit manifest several forms of synaptic plasticity. Here, we developed {{a model of the}} circuit and investigated the ways in which depression (DEP) and potentiation (POT) contributed to information processing. DEP limited the amount of motor neuron activity that could be elicited by the monosynaptic pathway alone. POT within the monosynaptic pathway did not compensate for DEP. There was, however, a synergistic interaction between POT and the polysynaptic pathway. This synergism extended the dynamic range of the network, and the interplay between DEP and <b>POT</b> made the <b>circuit</b> responded preferentially to long-duration, low-frequency inputs...|$|R
40|$|USBM Contract H 0133045 {{consists}} of the design, build and test of 50 waveform generators. The waveform generator is a small ULF transmitter operating in the 1 to 3 KHz frequency range {{for the purpose of}} locating trapped miners during a mine disaster. This contract provided for the design, test, and building of 50 waveform generators using a discrete component construction with an option of using hybrid construction techniques within 105 days after the effective date of the contract. Because of large quantity economic considerations, this option was not initiated. Two engineering models were designed, constructed and tested and 50 final production units were fabricated using discrete construction. Complete documentation is supplied under a separate package which includes final schematics, parts list, layout information, equipment specification, production test procedures and qualification test procedures. Ten units have been delivered to the USBM. The remaining 40 units are being retained for packaging under contract H 0242010 Transmitter Package and Receivers. A great deal of experience has been gained {{as a result of this}} contract. A final discrete <b>potted</b> printed <b>circuit</b> configuration has been arrived at that is now ready for field testing. After field testing, any desired changes should be incorporated into a final design. However, as a result of the current experience gained building and testing the production units, this printed circuit package together with potting procedure could be improved to reduce future costs. For example, the printed circuit board could be increased in size by 0. 125 to 0. 2 inches and all components could be mounted directly to the board eliminating costly hand stacking of components. The new printe...|$|R
