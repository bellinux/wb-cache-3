50|$|Motorola did {{not release}} {{the phone in}} the USA, Canada, or Australia, but it did {{register}} the <b>phone</b> <b>with</b> the <b>US</b> FCC, thereby approving it for use in the USA. As a result, many American specialty phone stores carry the phone, and Americans, Canadians, and Australians can order unlocked versions of the Z8 from a variety of websites, including both Motorola's UK website and eBay. An unlocked Z8 purchased outside the USA, Canada, or Australia can be used on any GSM network in those countries simply by inserting the user's SIM card. Z8s with foreign SIM cards also are capable of roaming on any those countries' GSM networks.|$|R

50|$|Six {{months after}} his arrest, Mohamed {{returned}} {{from a trip to}} the Sudan where he met with Osama bin Laden, and brought Abul-Dahab with him. Dahab later told Egyptian interrogators he had withdrawn $3,000 from a Californian bank account on orders of bin Laden himself, to offer as bail money to lawyer Phil Rankin. The pair hoped to have Marzouk released and possibly smuggle him into the United States. Mohamed was viewed suspiciously and subsequently detained by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) himself. However, after a brief <b>phone</b> call <b>with</b> <b>U.S.</b> Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent John Zent, Mohamed was identified as a CIA agent. Marzouk spent nearly a year in detention in Canada before his refugee status was confirmed and he was released, although Canadian authorities prevented him from being given permanent resident status due to their suspicions, and he was instead granted only refugee status on December 12, 1994.|$|R
50|$|It {{went on to}} win four prizes in Iran at the Isfahan Film Festival for Children and Young Adults and at the Fajr International Film Festival. For {{several years}} after its release, Kanoon's Channel 2 would {{broadcast}} the film every year on New Year's Day. Outside of Iran The White Balloon received excellent reviews and was shown at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Camera d'Or. It also won the Golden Award of the Governor of Tokyo for Best Film and the Bronze Dragon for Best Film of Young Cinema at the 1995 Tokyo International Film Festival, the International Jury Award at the 1995 São Paulo International Film Festival and the Best Film Award at the 1996 Cinéfest Sudbury International Film Festival. It was Iran's official submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the 68th Academy Awards; however, the Iranian government asked the Academy to withdraw the film after Iran's relations <b>with</b> the <b>US</b> began to deteriorate. The Academy refused to withdraw the film, which was not nominated, and Panahi was forbidden by the Iranian government to travel to the Sundance Film Festival or to participate in <b>phone</b> interviews <b>with</b> <b>US</b> reporters to promote the film.|$|R
40|$|The smart <b>phones</b> {{we carry}} <b>with</b> <b>us</b> are {{becoming}} ubiquitous with {{everyday life and}} the sensing capabilities of these devices allow us to provide context-aware services. In this paper, we discuss the development of UniNav, a context-aware mobile application that delivers personalised campus maps for universities. The application utilises university students’ details to provide information and services that are relevant and important to them. It helps students to navigate within the campus and become familiar with their university environment quickly. A study was undertaken to evaluate the acceptability and usefulness of the campus map, {{as well as the}} impact on a users’ navigation efficiency by utilising the personal and environmental contexts. The result indicates the integration of personal and environmental contexts on digital maps can improve its usefulness and navigation efficiency...|$|R
40|$|In our {{everyday}} tasks context {{plays an important}} role, we act {{based on the information}} we have or based on what we can see, hear or feel about surrounding. Using this information about context we use to adapt ourselves and our behavior for example in class room we usually whisper when we want to communicate with other class fellow, but in cafeteria we talk normally. Due to the advancements in technology and mobile computing, we are now able to carry computers and smart <b>phones</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> almost everywhere and use them as an alternative to desktop computers. Ubiquitous computing goes step further and refers to the world where computation is being weaved into every day object. In typical ubiquitous computing scenario many invisible computers interact with each other to help user in getting his task done. The ability of being carried easily, i. e. mobility and their presence almost everywhere make it necessary for computer systems, taking part in ubiquitous computing environment, context-aware. If computers can sense the environment they are being used in, they can help user in providing only relevant information, information at correct place and time and such systems can also adapt their behavior according to their surroundings. For example, if would be nice if our mobile phone automatically set to silent profile, whenever we are in class room or in a meeting room. Ubicollab is a platform for supporting collaboration and is a result of research work done in the areas of mobility and ubiquitous computing. Mobility and ubiquity being the inherent properties of UbiCollab, requires it to be aware of context just like another ubiquitous system. It will help UbiCollab applications to adapt their behavior as per surrounding and will enhance the experience of collaboration by using the resources nearby. I researched in the area of context-aware ubiquitous computing and used the results of my research to design and implement a solution for making UbiCollab context-aware. The proposed solution answers research problem related with context itself and different aspect of context. Context definition for UbiCollab has already been defined in work previously done; my solution addresses how to represent this contextual information in simple and effective manner, how to gather location information using different and heterogeneous sensors in understandable and standard format. The outcome of this work comprises of proposed context model, design and implementation of Space Manager for working with spaces, design and usage of flexible data store for storing space information and design and implementation of Location Service Manager for gathering location information using different location sensing technologies. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{day-to-day life}} use and {{performance}} of mobile phones has increased drastically from previous few years. Most of them take the benefit of extremely capable smartphones for file sharing. Exisiting peer-to-peer system[4][8] suffers from frequent disconnections and requires retranmission of data in case of transmission failure. Smart <b>phones</b> provides <b>us</b> <b>with</b> SMS facility which is not free of cost,so we proposed an application called Seamless File Sharing[1] that provides <b>us</b> <b>with</b> chatting and file uploading facility free of cost without using any internet facility. Here we use two methods of data sharing one through WiFi network[4][5] and other through Bluetooth. First file transmission is done through WiFi and if connection is not possible then file transmission automatically switches to Bluetooth network. So an Adhoc network is created for sharing file contents. Transferring file through internet is costly so adhoc network {{can be used for}} file sharing. This application has an a benefit of low battery consumption...|$|R
