40|$|A concept {{based on}} the Peroxidase-chip (<b>P-chip),</b> {{antibody}} co-immobilization, competitive and enzyme-channeling principle was exploited to develop an integrated flow-through amperometric biosensor for detection of environmental pollutants such as s-triazine herbicides. In this concept, recombinant peroxidase is immobilized on the gold electrode (<b>P-chip)</b> {{in such a way}} that direct electron transfer is achieved. The recognition and quantitation the target analyte is realized through the competition between the simazine-glucose oxidase (GOD) conjugate and free simazine for the binding sites of the monoclonal antibody co-immobilized with peroxidase on the gold electrode. The arrangement allows to generate a specific signal in the presence of glucose through the channeling of H 2 O 2 produced by GOD conjugate bound to the antibody. The immunosensor exhibited 50 % signal decrease (IC 50 value) at aproximately 0. 02 mug l(- 1). A concentration of 0. 1 ng l(- 1) gave a signal clearly distinguishable from the blank whereas the ELISA using the same antibody had a typical detection limit of about 1 mug l(- 1), which is four orders of magnitude higher compared to the presented biosensor system. The results demonstrated that gene engineering biomolecules, in this case recombinant peroxidase, might be attractive reagents for the development of electrochemical immunosensors.

40|$|OBJETIVE: The {{advance of}} {{research}} in child and adolescent psychiatry in Brazil heavily depends {{on the existence of}} instruments for the investigation of psychiatric syndromes adapted to Brazilian Portuguese. METHODS: This article describes a careful process of translation of the Children's Interview for Psychiatric Syndromes for the purpose of use in research in Brazil. The Children's Interview for Psychiatric Syndromes has a version for parents (<b>P-ChIPs)</b> and a version for children (ChIPS). In this article, the sections of <b>P-ChIPS</b> referring to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional-defiant disorder, conduct disorder, mania/hypomania, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and psychotic disorders were translated to Brazilian Portuguese. The sections of the ChIPS referring to substance use disorders, social anxiety disorder, specific phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disoder, separation anxiety disorder, post-traumatic disorders and depression/dysthimia were also adapted. Each section was translated by two independent translators and later discussed in a committee composed of experts in the field of Psychiatry and a professional of the field of linguistics. RESULT: A final version containing an interview for the main psychiatric syndromes was defined. CONCLUSION: The translated <b>P-ChIPS</b> is a helpful instrument in children and adolescent clinical evaluation...|$|E
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} {{of the private sector}} in China in recent decades has created a large number of capital-hungry private sector firms.

In light of international investors’ and regulators’ concerns about the corporate finance practice of China’s private sector firms, particularly regarding the integrity of their reported earnings, we investigate whether these firms aggressively manipulate their accounts by examining those listed in Hong Kong, commonly known as <b>P-chips.</b> We find systematic evidence that <b>P-chips</b> engage in more earnings management and other corporate misbehaviors than their counterparts in Hong Kong. We posit and provide evidence consistent with cross-jurisdictional enforcement difficulty as a possible explanation to P-chips’ questionable practice, and discuss its implications...|$|E
40|$|Surface exposed cysteines were genetically {{engineered}} {{in the structure}} of recombinant horseradish peroxidase (rHRP). Recombinant forms of HRP with either a His-tag or a Strep-tag at the C-terminus were produced, which additionally had cysteines at positions 57, 189 or 309 (C-terminus) of the polypeptide chain. An E coli expression system was exploited. The effect of these mutations on the direct electron transfer (ET) between An and the enzyme was studied in the reaction of the bioelectrocatalytic reduction of H 2 O 2, at - 50 mV versus AgAgCl, on rHRP-modified Au electrodes placed in a wall-jet flow-through electrochemical cell. Adsorptive immobilisation of rHRPs on pre-oxidised Au from the protein solution at pH 6. 0 provided a high and stable current response to H 2 O 2 due to its bioelectrocatalytic reduction based on direct (mediatoriess) ET between Au and the active site of the rHRPs. Comparative analysis of the direct ET rate constants, estimated from the amperometric data on direct and mediated ET in the presence of catechol at pH 7. 4 and 6. 0, gave evidence that the introduction of the His-tag or cysteine in the C-terminal area of the enzyme resulted in an increased efficiency of direct ET due to a favourable coupled electron and proton transfer pathway. Due to the high efficiency of direct ET, the sensitivity was independent on the addition of the mediator or change of pH indicating that the response to H 2 O 2 is determined solely by the mass transfer of the analyte to the active site of HRP. The sensitivities obtained for the Au electrodes modified with rHRPs (2. 0 +/- 0. 1 A M- 1 cm(- 2)) and the low detection limit for H 2 O 2 (10 nM) paves the way to develop the <b>P-chip</b> (peroxidase chip) - a biosensors system of a microscopic size for a mediatorless detection of H 2 O 2 based on direct ET between Au and the recombinant forms of HRP.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} effect of {{methylphenidate}} on the diagnosis of oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD) comorbid with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHOD: We conducted an open-label study in which 10 children and adolescents with a dual diagnosis of ODD and ADHD were assessed for their ODD symptoms and treated with methylphenidate. At least one month after ADHD symptoms were under control, ODD symptoms were reevaluated with the Parent form of the Children Interview for Psychiatric Syndromes (<b>P-ChIPS).</b> RESULTS: Nine of the 10 patients no longer fulfilled diagnostic criteria for ODD after they were treated with methylphenidate for ADHD. CONCLUSION: Methylphenidate {{seems to be an}} effective treatment for ODD, as well as for ADHD itself. The implications for the treatment of patients with ODD not comorbid with ADHD needs further investigation.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Comparar o desempenho dos tipos de TDAH em tarefas de seletividade, sustentação e atenção alternada, considerando tempo médio de reação, número de erros por ação e número de erros por omissão em teste computadorizado de atenção visual (TAVIS-III). MÉTODOS: Cento e duas crianças e adolescentes de duas escolas particulares e uma escola pública da cidade do Rio de Janeiro, com idades entre 6 e 17 anos com diagnóstico de TDAH, segundo DSM-IV, foram submetidas ao TAVIS-III. A separação por grupos respeitou os tipos determinados por entrevista semi-estruturada (<b>P-CHIPS),</b> e os resultados foram comparados levando-se em consideração o fator grupo. RESULTADOS: O tipo combinado (C) revelou-se o mais comum (n = 65; 63, 7 %), seguido pelo predominantemente desatento (D) (n = 32; 31, 4 %). O tipo predominantemente hiperativo-impulsivo (HI) foi excluído das análises estatísticas em virtude da baixa freqüência. O desempenho do grupo C revelou-se {{inferior}} apenas em tarefa de atenção sustentada, no que tange ao número de erros por ação e tempo médio de reação (p OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} effect of ADHD subtypes in tasks of focused, shifted and sustained attention in a visual attention test (TAVIS-III). Indexes of hit reaction time, omission errors and commission errors were considered for each task. METHODS: One hundred two children and adolescents aged from 6 to 17 years old recruited from one public and two private schools {{in the city of}} Rio de Janeiro with ADHD diagnosis, according to DSM-IV criteria, were evaluated. Three groups were created following the subtypes determined by the semi-structured interview (<b>P-CHIPS).</b> Group performances were compared in order to determine subtype effects. RESULTS: The combined subtype (C) was the most common group (n = 65; 63. 7 %), followed by the inattentive subtype (I) (n = 32; 31. 4 %). Hyperactive-impulsive (HI) group was excluded from statistical analysis due to its low frequency. The performance of the C group was found comparatively worse only in the sustained attention task, where subjects presented slower hit reaction time and committed more commission errors (p < 0. 05) than the I group. CONCLUSION: Only in longer tasks of visual attention, combined patients had a worse performance than Inattentive ones...|$|E

40|$|Background Prostate cancer (PCa) is {{the most}} common {{malignancy}} among men in the United States. Though highly sensitive, the often-used prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test has low speci-ficity which leads to overdiagnosis and overtreatment of PCa. This paper presents results of a retrospective study that indicates that testing for macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1 (MIC- 1) concentration along with the PSA assay could provide much improved specificity to the assay. Methods The MIC- 1 serum level was determined by a novel p-Chip-based immunoassay run on 70 retrospective samples. The assay was configured on <b>p-Chips,</b> small integrated circuits (IC) capable of storing in their electronic memories a serial number to identify the molecular probe immobilized on its surface. The distribution of MIC- 1 and pre-determined PSA con-centrations were displayed in a 2 D plot and the predictive power of the dual MIC- 1 /PSA assay was analyzed. Results MIC- 1 concentration in serum was elevated in PCa patients (1. 44 ng/ml) compared to nor-mal and biopsy-negative individuals (0. 93 ng/ml and 0. 88 ng/ml, respectively). In addition, the MIC- 1 level was correlated with the progression of PCa. The area under the receiver op-erator curve (AUC-ROC) was 0. 81 providing an assay sensitivity of 83. 3 % and specificity of 60. 7 % by using a cutoff of 0. 494 for the logistic regression value of MIC- 1 and PSA.
