5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in Void material. If {{he opens the}} breach and reverses it, anything saturated in Void material will be pulled in. Everyone except Jackie has crossed the breach and is thus vulnerable to being trapped in the Void, so the Doctor sends them all to the parallel universe. Rose decides she would rather be with the Doctor than her family and jumps back to help him. The Cybermen attempt to stop the Doctor but are repelled by a converted Ms. Hartman, who has resisted the effects of her conversion and at least partially retains her sense of self. The Doctor and Rose open the breach and hang on to magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks are pulled in. The Cult of Skaro use an emergency temporal shift to escape. Rose's lever slips, and in resetting it she loses her grip and plunges toward the Void. At the last second, Pete reappears and grabs her, and together they transport back to the parallel universe. The breach closes, leaving a devastated Rose trapped in the parallel universe. The devices used to travel between the two worlds have also stopped working. The Doctor <b>presses</b> <b>his</b> ear against the wall, as a tearful Rose does {{the same in the}} other universe, as if trying to listen for each other.|$|E
25|$|An {{offer of}} a draw should be made after a player makes a move but before he <b>presses</b> <b>his</b> game clock. The other player also declines the offer if he makes a move, and the draw offer {{will no longer be}} in effect. The {{offer of a}} draw should be {{recorded}} by each player in their scoresheet using the symbol (=) as per Appendix C.12 of FIDE Laws of Chess.|$|E
25|$|Burroughs {{supported}} {{himself and}} his addiction by publishing pieces in small literary <b>presses.</b> <b>His</b> avant-garde reputation grew internationally as hippies and college students discovered his earlier works. He developed a close friendship with Antony Balch and lived with a young hustler named John Brady who continuously brought home young women despite Burroughs's protestations. In {{the midst of this}} personal turmoil, Burroughs managed to complete two works: a novel written in screenplay format, The Last Words of Dutch Schultz (1969); and the traditional prose-format novel The Wild Boys (1971).|$|E

25|$|Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, {{a form of}} {{artificial}} ventilation, is the act of assisting or stimulating respiration, a metabolic process referring to the overall exchange of gases in the body, where a rescuer <b>presses</b> <b>his</b> or her mouth against that of the victim and blows air into the person's lungs. Assistance takes many forms, but generally entails providing air for {{a person who is}} not breathing or is not making sufficient respiratory effort on his/her own. It is used on a patient with a beating heart or as part of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to achieve the internal respiration).|$|E
25|$|Petitioners {{allege that}} Novak's July 14, 2003 column {{publicly}} disclosed Ms. Wilson's covert CIA employment {{and that that}} disclosure 'destroyed her cover as a classified CIA employee'. Petitioners, however, allege that Novak's source was Armitage, and do not allege {{that any of the}} three defendants against whom Mr. Wilson <b>presses</b> <b>his</b> First Amendment claim-Cheney, Rove, and Libby-caused that column to be published. In the absence of factual allegations that Mr. Wilson's alleged injury from the public disclosure of his wife's CIA employment is 'fairly traceable' to alleged conduct by Cheney, Rove, or Libby, petitioners have failed to establish Article III jurisdiction over Mr. Wilson's First Amendment claim.|$|E

500|$|Mating {{takes place}} at {{different}} times of the year {{in different parts of the}} manta's range. Courtship is difficult to observe in this fast-swimming fish, although mating [...] "trains" [...] with multiple individuals swimming closely behind each other are sometimes seen in shallow water. The mating sequence may be triggered by a full moon and seems to be initiated by a male following closely behind a female while she travels at around [...] per hour. He makes repeated efforts to grasp her pectoral fin with his mouth, which may take twenty or thirty minutes. Once he has a tight grip, he turns upside-down and <b>presses</b> <b>his</b> ventral side against hers. He then inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca where they remain for sixty to ninety seconds. The clasper forms a tube which channels sperm from the genital papilla; a siphon propels the seminal fluid into the oviduct. The male continues to grip the female's pectoral fin with his teeth for a further few minutes as both continue to swim, often followed by up to twenty other males. The pair then part. For some reason the male almost always grasps the left pectoral fin, and females often have scars that illustrate this.|$|E
500|$|This is an oviparous species. In the summer, females {{will lay}} between 11 and 26 smooth white eggs, each roughly [...] The eggs stick {{together}} in a bunch. The eggs are laid in hollow trees, termite mounds, holes in the ground or females will make their own nests. Before mating, a pair of will [...] "dance", raising their heads a foot or more {{off the ground and}} moving to and fro. This may continue for an hour before mating takes place, when the male <b>presses</b> <b>his</b> [...] (the chamber into which the reproductive, urinary, and intestinal canals empty) against that of the female. Female forest cobras may stand guard and are irritable and aggressive during the breeding period. A female is liable to attack without provocation, with potentially fatal consequences for passers-by if her nest is near a footpath. Hatchlings are born completely independent and are usually [...] in length.

These snakes are known to have a long lifespan. One captive specimen lived for 28 years, which is the record for the longest lived venomous snake in captivity. Another specimen held at the Melbourne Zoo in Australia turned 35 on September 1, 2014.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{his move}} to Atlético Madrid, Sky Sports analyst Adam Bate {{wrote that he}} was the perfect fit for manager Diego Simeone's style as Mandžukić is 'often the {{instigator}} of the press with his energetic running, Mandzukic battles defences, driving them back to create space for teammates as well as preventing opponents building patiently without pressure on the ball.' Bate further added that the Croatian 'is both a physical and mobile striker who does so much of his best work without the ball, seemingly doing the work of two players and thus allowing an extra man in midfield.' ESPN FC contributor Michael Cox has also praised Mandžukić for his excellent team-work, highlighting that while he <b>presses</b> <b>his</b> opponents energetically when they attempt to play the ball out from the back, he is also extremely diligent and disciplined {{in the manner in which}} he drops back into his own half to defend behind the ball if his opponents manage to bypass his team's pressing. In 2014, Aleksandar Holiga commented on Mandžukić's playing, stating that [...] "e stretches the defences with constant movement and seemingly endless stamina, opening space for others to come from behind or cut inside from the wing; his pressing on the ball has proven decisive on a number of previous occasions and he is, of course, one of the best strikers in the world when it comes to aerial power. So even if he does not score himself, his presence could be key for the team’s chances.|$|E
