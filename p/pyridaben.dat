40|$|BACKGROUND]Cyenopyrafen is an {{inhibitor}} {{of complex}} II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. It has a molecular structure that shares some common features with frequently used complex I inhibitors such as <b>pyridaben.</b> To evaluate whether this similarity in structure poses a cross-resistance risk that might complicate resistance management, we selected for <b>pyridaben</b> and cyenopyrafen {{resistance in the}} laboratory and characterized resistance. [RESULTS]The selection for cyenopyrafen conferred cross-resistance to <b>pyridaben</b> and vice versa. Resistance towards these both acaricides was incompletely dominant in adult females. However, in eggs maternal effects were observed in <b>pyridaben</b> resistance, {{but not in the}} cyenopyrafen-resistance (completely dominant). In the cyenopyrafen resistant strain, the LC 50 of eggs remained lower than the commercially recommended concentration. The common detoxification mechanisms by cytochrome P 450 was involved in resistance to these acaricides. Carboxyl esterases were also involved in cyenopyrafen resistance as a major factor. [CONCLUSIONS]Although cross-resistance suggests that <b>pyridaben</b> resistance would confer cyenopyrafen cross-resistance, susceptibility in eggs functions to delay the development of cyenopyrafen resistance...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Pyridaben,</b> a pyridazinone derivative, {{is a new}} {{acaricide}} and insecticide {{for control}} of mites and some insects such as white flies, aphids and thrips. Objective: This {{study was designed to}} elucidate how <b>pyridaben</b> can affect the sperms' morphological parameters, its DNA integrity, and to estimate the effect of various quantities of <b>pyridaben</b> on in vitro fertilization rate. Materials and Methods: In this study, 80 adult male Balb/C strain mice were used. Animals were divided into control and two test groups. Control group received distilled water. The test group was divided into two subgroups, viz, high dose (212 mg/kg/day) and low dose (53 mg/kg/day) and they received the <b>pyridaben,</b> orally for duration of 45 days. The spermatozoa were obtained from caudae epididymides on day 45 in all groups. Sperm viability, protamin compression (nuclear maturity), DNA double-strand breaks, and in vitro fertilizing (IVF) ability were examined. Results: The <b>pyridaben</b> treatment provoked a significant decrease in sperm population and viability in epididymides. The data obtained from this experiment revealed that, the <b>pyridaben</b> brings about negative impact on the sperm maturation and DNA integrity in a time-dependent manner, which consequently caused a significant (p< 0. 05) reduction in IVF capability.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to alveolar developmental arrest in a mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). To induce BPD, 3 -day-old mice {{were exposed to}} 75 % O 2. Mice were studied at two time points of hyperoxia (72 h or 2 wk) and after 3 weeks of recovery in room air (RA). A separate cohort of mice was exposed to <b>pyridaben,</b> a complex-I (C-I) inhibitor, for 72 hours or 2 weeks. Alveolarization was quantified by radial alveolar count and mean linear intercept methods. Pulmonary mitochondrial function was defined by respiration rates, ATP-production rate, and C-I activity. At 72 hours, hyperoxic mice demonstrated significant inhibition of C-I activity, reduced respiration and ATP production rates, and significantly decreased radial alveolar count compared with controls. Exposure to <b>pyridaben</b> for 72 hours, as expected, caused significant inhibition of C-I and ADP-phosphorylating respiration. Similar to hyperoxic littermates, these pyridaben-exposed mice exhibited significantly delayed alveolarization compared with controls. At 2 weeks of exposure to hyperoxia or <b>pyridaben,</b> mitochondrial respiration was inhibited and associated with alveolar developmental arrest. However, after 3 weeks of recovery from hyperoxia or 2 weeks after 72 hours of exposure to <b>pyridaben</b> alveolarization significantly improved. In addition, there was marked normalization of C-I and mitochondrial respiration. The degree of hyperoxia-induced pulmonary simplification and recovery strongly (r 2 = 0. 76) correlated with C-I activity in lung mitochondria. Thus, the arrest of alveolar development induced by either hyperoxia or direct inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation indicates that bioenergetic failure to maintain normal alveolar development {{is one of the}} fundamental mechanisms responsible for BPD...|$|E

40|$|A Belgian field strain (MR-VP) of Tetranychus urticae (Koch) (Acari: Tetranychidae) {{exhibits}} {{different levels}} of resistance to four frequently used METI (mitochondria) electron transport inhibitor) -acaricides, i. e. tebufenpyrad, fenpyroximate, <b>pyridaben</b> and fenazaquin. Resistance factors for these compounds were 184, 1547, 5971 and 35, respectively. A 23. 5 -fold increase in 7 -ethoxy- 4 -trifluoromethylcoumarin O-deethylation activity suggested that metabolic resistance through elevated levels of cytochrome P 450 dependent monooxygenase-activity is a possible resistance mechanism. However, synergism studies with different metabolic inhibitors revealed some contrasting resistance mechanisms between the METI-acaricides. Tebufenpyrad resistance could only be synergized after pre-treatment with the monooxygenase inhibitor piperonyl butoxide (PBO), whereas <b>pyridaben</b> resistance was strongly synergized both by PBO and the esterase inhibitor S,S,S-tributylphosphorotrithioate (DEF). Resistance levels to fenpyroximate could neither be suppressed by PBO nor by DEF. Although METI-acaricides are structurally related, these findings probably reflect a different role of esterases and monooxygenases in metabolic detoxification between these compounds. The overall lack of synergism by diethylmaleate (DEM) suggests that glutathione-S-transferases are not {{an important factor in}} resistance to METIs. Reciprocal crosses between susceptible females and resistant males showed no maternal effect, and resistance to METI-acaricides was inherited generally as a dominant trait.

A respiration inhibitor that inhibits aflatoxin production was identified during a screening process for natural, aflatoxin-production inhibitors. This prompted us to evaluate respiration inhibitors as potential aflatoxin control agents. The inhibitory activities of four natural inhibitors, seven synthetic miticides, and nine synthetic fungicides were evaluated on aflatoxin production in Aspergillus parasiticus. All of the natural inhibitors (rotenone, siccanin, aptenin A 5, and antimycin A) inhibited fungal aflatoxin production with IC 50 values around 10 ÂµM. Among the synthetic miticides, <b>pyridaben,</b> fluacrypyrim, and tolfenpyrad exhibited strong inhibitory activities with IC 50 values less than 0. 2 ÂµM, whereas cyflumetofen did not show significant inhibitory activity. Of the synthetic fungicides, boscalid, pyribencarb, azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and kresoxim-methyl demonstrated strong inhibitory activities, with IC 50 values less than 0. 5 ÂµM. Fungal growth was not significantly affected by any of the inhibitors tested at concentrations used. There was no correlation observed between the targets of respiration inhibitors (complexes I, II, and III) and their IC 50 values for aflatoxin-production inhibitory activity.

Dicofol is structurally similar to DDT. It is persistent in food and water, highly toxic to aquatic life and causes egg-shell thinning in some bird species. High concern, {{due to the lack}} of dicofol measurements in the Arctic, proving long range transport and bioaccumulation in wild life species, supports further impact assessment of this product. Under Stockholm Convention, substances identified as POPs are regulated with the objective to protect the environment and the human health.

On {{the basis of}} 24 -h LD 50 values after topical application, the only pesticide that had higher activity than permethrin was fipronil, with LD 50 values lower than permethrin for 107 -, 4, 849 -, and 2 -fold against Ae. aegypti, Cx. quinquefasciatus Say, and An. quadrimaculatus Say, respectively. Abamectin, imidacloprid, spinosad, diazinon, and carbaryl showed slightly lower activity than permethrin (3 Ìc 20 -fold). However, bifenazate showed very low activity against the three mosquito species tested, with LD 50 values higher than permthrin for 3 Ìe 1000 -fold.

Pesticide exposure is a major risk factor for PD, and paraquat (PQ), <b>pyridaben</b> (PY) and maneb (MN) are amongst the most widely used pesticides. We studied mRNA expression using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) in the ventral midbrain (VMB) and striatum (STR) of PQ, PY and paraquat+maneb (MNPQ) treated mice, followed by pathway analysis. We found concordance of signaling pathways between the three pesticide models in both the VMB and STR as well as concordance in these two brain areas. The concordant signaling pathways with relevance to PD pathogenesis were e. g. axonal guidance signaling, Wnt/b-catenin signaling, as well as pathways not previously linked to PD, e. g. basal cell carcinoma, human embryonic stem cell pluripotency and role of macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis. Human PD pathways previously identified by expression analysis, concordant with VMB pathways identified in our study were axonal guidance signaling, Wnt/b-catenin signaling, IL- 6 signaling, ephrin receptor signaling, TGF-b signaling, PPAR signaling and G-protein coupled receptor signaling. Human PD pathways concordant with the STR pathways in our study were Wnt/b-catenin signaling, axonal guidance signaling and G-protein coupled receptor signaling.

40|$|The cotton whitefly, Bemisia tabaci Genn. and Two-Spotted Spider Mites (TSSM), Tetranychus urticae Koch are {{emerging}} as important sucking pests of cotton crop. The indiscriminate {{use of pesticides}} against insect pests {{have resulted in the}} development of resistance among these pests as well as environmental and health hazards. The use of microbial control agents is an important approach to combat this menace. The present study was therefore, carried out to determine the efficacy of some strains of entomopathogenic fungi viz.,Metarhizium anisopliae, Isaria fumosorosea, Lecanicillium muscarium and Beaveria bassiana against all immature stages of whitefly and eggs and adult females of TSSM in the Department of Entomology at University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan and Department of Pure and Applied Ecology, Swansea University, Swansea U. K. for the bioassays on whitefly. The potential of various entomopathogenic fungi was evaluated on 2 nd instar nymphs of whitefly and four of them were found promising. The detailed studies were carried out on other immature stages of whitefly with the promising strains. The dosemortality response was observed by using serial dilutions, 1 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 105 to 1 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 108 conidia mL- 1 against most susceptible stage using detached leaf immersion method for whitefly and spraying the detached leaf for bioassay with TSSM. All tested fungal isolates caused mortality in the tested stages of both insects under consideration except eggs of whitefly for which very low susceptibility was observed. The L. muscarium (V 17) isolate was highly virulent among the tested ones for whitefly nymphs while Pf (n 32) isolate was highly virulent against both the stages of TSSM. The mortality of each stage was recorded daily up to 8 days for both the insects under study. The % mortality significantly differed based on fungal isolates, stage of the insect and conidial concentrations. The % mortality increased with increasing the dose of conidial concentration of each fungal isolate in each insect. For whitefly, the most virulent isolate, (V 17) has LC 50 value of 1. 9 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 105 conidia mL- 1 and it killed about 89. 58 % of the treated second instar nymphs 8 days post treatment while its LT 50 value at higher concentration is 4. 03 days. For TSSM, the most virulent isolate was Pf (n 32) with lowest LC 50 value of 9. 1 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 104 conidia mL- 1 on 8 th day and LT 50 value of 4. 58 days at 1 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 108 conidia mL- 1. It killed about 82. 16 % of the inoculated females 8 days post treatment. The results indicated that L. muscarium and I. fumosorosea strains have potential as microbial control agent against cotton whitefly and mites, respectively, in Pakistan. The studies were also carried out to determine the LC 50 values and also efficacy of some commercial insecticides and acaricides against whitefly and TSSM in the laboratory. Four different insecticides were evaluated in the lab against 2 nd instar nymphs of whitefly on cotton. All the tested insecticides caused significant mortality of whitefly from 3 - 5 days post treatment. However, the most effective insecticides for whitefly, up to 5 days were MospilonÃ¯Â¿Â½ and ConfidorÃ¯Â¿Â½ with very low LC 50 values while others were also equally effective but with high LC 50 values. Similarly, the chlorfenapyr 36 SC, <b>pyridaben</b> 15 EC and fenpyroximate 5 SC proved to be the best miticides among the tested ones for the control of TSSM based on their LC 50 values. The nine commercial pesticides and their effects on germination of conidia and mycelial growth of highly efficacious fungal strains viz., I. fumosorosea and L. muscarium were investigated in vitro. There was a significant variation in conidial germination as well as mycelial growth by all tested pesticides depending upon the dose of pesticide and type of fungus. Among the pesticides tested azocyclotin was proved to be highly toxic to germination of spores as well as mycelial growth followed by <b>pyridaben,</b> acetamiprid and propergite while buprofezin was the least toxic. Isaria was proved to be more sensitive at field recommended doses than Lecanicillium strain to all pesticides. Generally, among all pesticides used the insecticides were more compatible to fungi than acaricides although these also inhibited germination of spores and fungal growth to some extent. The combined application of pesticides with selective fungi proved to be synergistic giving more control than used alone. The combined effects were tested under greenhouse conditions on potted plants. Buprofezin, acetamiprid, imidacloprid and diafenthuron were used against 2 nd instar nymphs of whitefly while chlorfenapyr, <b>pyridaben</b> and fenpyroximate were used against TSSM. Only buprofezin and imidacloprid insecticides showed synergistic effects and others additive while no one showed antagonistic results. Chlorfenapyr combined with fungus yielded highest mortality among acaricides tested. However, further investigations under field conditions may reveal more comprehensive results...|$|E

This research evaluated the physiological selectivity of 50 pesticides (22 insecticides, 16 acaricides, 10 fungicides, 1 mineral oil and 1 vegetable oil) used in citrus on parasitoid Tamarixia radiata. For that purpose, discs of the Valencia sweet orange variety, 3. 5 cm diameter were sprayed using a Burkhard-Pottertower adjusted to a pressure of 15 lb. pol- 2, enabling the application of 1. 8 Â± 0. 1 mg of chemical solution. cm- 2, according to the methodology proposed by IOBC/WPRS. After application, the discs were kept {{at room temperature for}} three hours to dry the residues. Next, the discs were placed in Petri dishes containing 2 mL of a not gelled agar-water solution at 2. 5 %. Then, adult parasitoids with no more than 48 hours after emergence were exposed to residues. The experimental design was completely randomized with 51 treatments and five replicates, and each replication comprised 10 adults of the parasitoid.

40|$|The proton-translocating NADH-quinone {{oxidoreductase}} (EC 1. 6. 99. 3) is {{the largest}} and least understood enzyme complex of the respiratory chain. The mammalian mitochondrial enzyme (also called complex I) contains more than 40 subunits, whereas its structurally simpler bacterial counterpart (NDH- 1) in Paracoccus denitrificans and Thermus thermophilus HB- 8 consists of 14 subunits. A major unsolved question is the location and mechanism of the terminal electron transfer step from ironâsulfur cluster N 2 to quinone. Potent inhibitors acting at this key region are candidate photoaffinity probes to dissect NADH-quinone oxidoreductases. Complex I and NDH- 1 {{are very sensitive to}} inhibition by a variety of structurally diverse toxicants, including rotenone, piericidin A, bullatacin, and <b>pyridaben.</b> We designed (trifluoromethyl) diazirinyl[3 H]pyridaben ([3 H]TDP) as our photoaffinity ligand because it combines outstanding inhibitor potency, a suitable photoreactive group, and tritium at high specific activity. Photoaffinity labeling of mitochondrial electron transport particles was specific and saturable. Isolation, protein sequencing, and immunoprecipitation identified the high-affinity specifically labeled 23 -kDa subunit as PSST of complex I. Immunoprecipitation of labeled membranes of P. denitrificans and T. thermophilus established photoaffinity labeling of the equivalent bacterial NQO 6. Competitive binding and enzyme inhibition studies showed that photoaffinity labeling of the specific high-affinity binding site of PSST is exceptionally sensitive to each of the high-potency inhibitors mentioned above.

40|$|Rotenone and rotenoid-containing botanicals, {{important}} insecticides {{and fish}} poisons, {{are reported to}} have anticancer activity in rats and mice. The toxic action of rotenone is attributed to inhibition of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity and the purported cancer chemopreventive effect of deguelin analogs {{has been associated with}} inhibition of phorbol ester-induced ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity. This study defines a possible relationship between these two types of activity important in evaluating the toxicology of rotenoid pesticides and the suitability of the anticancer model. Fractionation of cubÃ© resin (the commercial rotenoid pesticide) establishes that the activity in both assays is due primarily to rotenone (IC 50 = 0. 8 â 4 nM), secondarily to deguelin, and in small part to rotenolone and tephrosin. In addition, the potency of 29 rotenoids from cubÃ© insecticide for inhibiting NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase in vitro assayed with bovine heart electron transport particles satisfactorily predicts their potency in vivo in the induced ODC assay using noncytotoxic rotenoid concentrations with cultured MCF- 7 human breast cancer cells (r = 0. 86). Clearly the molecular features of rotenoids essential for inhibiting NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase are similar to those for blocking ODC induction. This apparent correlation extends to 11 flavonoids and stilbenoids from cubÃ© resin (r = 0. 98) and genistein and resveratrol except for lower potency and less selectivity than the rotenoids relative to cytotoxicity. These findings on cubÃ© insecticide constituents and our earlier study comparing rotenone and <b>pyridaben</b> miticide indicate that inhibition of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity lowers the level of induced ODC activity leading to the antiproliferative effect and anticancer action...|$|E

An increasing number of studies suggest an important role of host immunity {{as a barrier to}} tumor formation and progression. Complex mechanisms and multiple pathways are involved in evading innate and adaptive immune responses, with a broad spectrum of chemicals displaying the potential to adversely influence immunosurveillance. The evaluation of the cumulative effects of low-dose exposures from the occupational and natural environment, especially if multiple chemicals target the same gene(s) or pathway(s), is a challenge. We reviewed common environmental chemicals and discussed their potential effects on immunosurveillance. Our overarching objective was to review related signaling pathways influencing immune surveillance such as the pathways involving PI 3 K/Akt, chemokines, TGF-Î², FAK, IGF- 1, HIF- 1 Î±, IL- 6, IL- 1 Î±, CTLA- 4 and PD- 1 /PDL- 1 could individually or collectively impact immunosurveillance.
