40|$|We derive Newton-type {{solution}} algorithms for a Bernoulli-type free-boundary <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> {{the continuous}} level. The Newton schemes are obtained by applying Hadamard shape derivatives to a suitable weak {{formulation of the}} free-boundary <b>problem.</b> <b>At</b> each Newton iteration, an updated free boundary position is obtained by solving a boundary-value <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> the current approximate domain. Since the boundary-value problem has a curvature-dependent boundary condition, an ideal discretization is provided by isogeometric analysis. Several numerical examples demonstrate the apparent quadratic convergence of the Newton schemes on isogeometric-analysis discretizations with C 1 -continuous discrete free boundaries...|$|R

5|$|As {{the spring}} of 1794 approached, the Committee of Public Safety, led by Robespierre, Couthon, Lebas and Saint-Just, {{exercised}} near complete control over the government. Despite the vast reach of their powers, however, rivals and enemies remained. One of the thorniest <b>problems,</b> <b>at</b> least to Robespierre, came {{in the shape of}} the populist agitator Jacques Hébert, who discharged torrents of criticism against bourgeois Jacobinism in his newspaper, Le Père Duchesne. Ultra-radical Hébertists in the Cordeliers Club undermined Jacobin efforts to court and manage the sans-culottes, and the most extreme Hébertists even called openly for insurrection.|$|E

He then attended Churchland High School and continued on their wrestling team, before moving to Great Bridge High School before attending Penn State University on a wrestling scholarship in 1999. After a rape allegation, he later transferred to and graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 2002, where he was on the wrestling team and received a degree in management science and information systems.|$|E

However, Fowler made only one more appearance for Manchester City before returning to Liverpool on a free transfer.|$|E
