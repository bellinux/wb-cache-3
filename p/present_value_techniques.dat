With cost {{of energy}} in the $ 2. 00 per 10 ^ 6 BTU range {{throughout}} the Western Industrialized World, the current value of one horsepower over a five-year period is in excess of $ 600. This high energy valuation is of relatively recent origin. Historically, initial cost has been the major purchase determinant in mechanical drive steam turbines for the process industries. In lifetime cost, the cost of energy (operating cost) was not a major factor and thus was largely neglected in evaluating the competitive products offered. In recent times the cost of energy has become the major determinant of lifetime cost and progressive users are evaluating equipment offerings using <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>techniques...</b>|$|E

Such efforts are seldom cheap, and they typically require making a business case {{in order to obtain}} funding. We review some of the main techniques from financial theory for evaluating the risk and returns associated with proposed investments and apply them to process improvement programs for software development. We also discuss significant theoreti-cal considerations as well as robustness and correctness issues associated with applying each of the techniques to software development and process improvement activities. Finally we introduce a <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>technique</b> that incorporates both risk and return that has many applications to software development activities and is recommended for use in a software process improvement context...|$|R
40|$|Listokin has {{recently}} drawn {{our attention to}} the fact that virtually nothing is known about the magnitude of prisoners’ discount rates in relation to their foregone income (legal or illegal), which incarceration implies. He argues that since prisoners are likely to exhibit high discount rates, pre sentence delays will impose higher costs on offenders not on bail compared with those who are granted bail by the court. Utilising actual plea choices made by a sample of not on bail prisoners for three different offences in NSW, this study derives convincing estimates of prisoners’ rates of time preference. Prisoners do discount future returns and at high rates, as predicted by criminologists and other scholars, who have addressed this issue theoretically. The modelling technique utilised in this paper (dynamic <b>present</b> <b>value)</b> captures the stochastic movement of the prisoner’s probability of conviction during the delay period. This is a considerable methodological improvement over the standard static <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>technique,</b> which is not appropriate to capture the dynamics of the final plea choice. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is a {{modified}} net present value, and how it could be a useful tool for synergy valuation in the process of business combination. Every successful acquisition has to result in synergy in the post acquisition value. In the process of valuation each company has three components that {{must be taken into account}} for an efficient valuation (assets, earning power and firm uniqueness). The process of analyzing business combination could be divided in three interdependent analyses: (1) An analyst must start by applying traditional capital budgeting analyses; (2) followed by identifying various flexibility options; and finally, (3) an analyst must determinate the present value of other strategic options along with the overall certainty of exercising them, together with the added certainty value of these options on traditional present value of business combination. Traditional capital budgeting analyses of business combination is based on net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>techniques.</b> These techniques result with inadequate present value if the post-acquisition reinvestment rate is different from the post-acquisition cost of capital. In these cases, the analyst can apply modified net present value method...|$|E

The external shading devices included a permanent horizontal overhang and a light shelf. The selected types of glazing included clear, reflective, tinted, low-emissivity coating, and heat-mirror glass. One concern about using external window attachments is that while reducing the solar heat gains, they also {{reduce the amount of}} the daylight needed to supplement interior lighting. Therefore the objective {{of this study was to}} explore which strategy would give a balance between solar heat gain reduction and daylight utilization and result in the most energy savings in the building. Computer simulations using an hourly energy calculation model were conducted to predict the building's total energy consumption using each strategy. The economics of each strategy were analyzed with lifecycle costing <b>techniques</b> using the <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>technique.</b> Results show that properly designed overhangs that shade clear glazing are slightly more cost-effective than specialized low-e glazing systems.

We discover compelling variations between large and small firms across all markets. While large firms frequently use <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>techniques</b> and the capital asset pricing model when assessing the financial feasibility of an investment opportunity, CFOs of small firms still rely on the payback criterion. Regarding debt policy we document more subtle disparities across firms and national samples. We also find substantial variation in corporate governance structures, which turn out to be more oriented at shareholder wealth in the Anglo-Saxon countries.

40|$|The {{uncertainty}} in road transportation of wood is inherent to its operational costs, {{to the amount}} of transported wood, to the traveled distance, to its revenue, and more. Although {{it is not possible to}} measure this uncertainty fully, it can be quantified by the investment risk, which is the probability and degree of financial loss. The objective of this study is to quantify the financial risk of the investment in wood transportation through Monte Carlo simulation, which uses realistic situations to estimate the operational cost of vehicles used for road transportation of wood. We quantify these uncertainties by assessing financial risk and building pseudorandom scenarios with the Monte Carlo simulation method, in addition to the Net <b>Present</b> <b>Value</b> <b>techniques,</b> the Modified Internal Rate of Return, and the Profitability Index, all commonly used in financial investment projects. The results show that the estimated operational costs are equivalent to the actual ones, along with the evidence that the cost of fuel, the driver’s manpower, and tires are components that mainly increase the degree of financial risk for an investment project in road transportation of wood. In contrast, optimizing the amount of transported wood and maximizing wood transportation cost have a significant and positive correlation with the volume of transported wood and the average price of wood transportation, leading to a reduction in the degree of financial risk...|$|E
40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper, I {{pointed out that}} Fisher, Lindahl, and Hicks contributed to the {{formation}} of the concept of economic income, and that Canning and Alexander contributed to its establishment. Moreover, although not generally asserted, I pointed out that two genealogies were born through the process of the development of the economic income concept. One is the Fisher-Canning genealogy characterized by economics－based monism (2 ̆ 2 colonization of accounting by economics 2 ̆ 2), and the other is the Hicks-Alexander genealogy characterized by economics and accounting-based dua 1 ism (2 ̆ 2 reconciliation between economic and accounting concept 2 ̆ 2). Essentially, the former is connected with the service-potentials concept (future economic benefits concept) and single evaluation by(discounted) present value. The latter is connected with the deprival value concept (value to the business concept) and multiple evaluations that focus on replacement cost. Further, there are some important differences. Which is premised; certainty or uncertainty, which is intended; stock-based income (single income) or stock and flow-based income (dual income), and whether self-generating goodwill is recognized on a balance sheet or not. This paper aims to review the two above genealogies and how they were developed after the formation and establishment of the concept of economic income, mainly focusing on the arguments from the 1960 s to the 1980 s. This paper is set out in the following way. First, that features of the Fisher-Canning genealogy have been taken over by AAA, Staubus, Sprouse=Moonitz, Revsine, etc. is clarified. Then that features of the Hicks-Alexander genealogy have been taken over by Wright, Barton, etc. is examined. Further, that both genealogies were combined (confused without distinguishing) by Solomons is analyzed. Although this paper focuses on arguments made up to the 1980 s, the economic income concept has become more fully developed as present value accounting after the 1990 s. Then in the 2000 s it has been developed as part of fair value accounting. Over a considerable period the two genealogies were generated, established and developed separately, with each system gaming support and respect. If they are now to be put back together in a single vessel, while this might be user-friendly, there will be a loss of theoretical restrictions. That is, economic income and present value lose their status as 2 ̆ 2 concepts 2 ̆ 2 and become merely 2 ̆ 2 tools 2 ̆ 2. Present value will come down to being a measurement technique of fair value accounting, as recently argued. If the scope of <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>techniques</b> is needlessly expanded, we face serious risk that they will be misused, as seen recently...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} the result of a {{graduation}} project, conducted at the financial consultancy firm Maritime Transport and Business Solutions, to fulfill the Master of Science program Management of Technology at the faculty of Technology, Policy and Management at Delft University of Technology. This thesis comes forth out the increasing awareness of the port industry on sustainability and the continuous growth of container transport. Dutch ports are more and more constrained by their physical and environmental boundaries. To reduce the environmental and physical constraints of ports, this research aims to examine whether it is possible to stimulate container terminal operators to enhance their environmental performance. Environment is one of the three elements to enhance sustainability. In order to enhance sustainability it is important to increase the environmental performance without compromising the economic and social factors. A port authority has two revenue streams which both can be used to pressure concessionaires and visiting modalities. This thesis focuses on the incorporation of environmental criteria in the concession agreement and thereby the feasibility to exert pressure on the private sector to increase sustainability. This is combined in the following research question, “How can environmental criteria be incorporated in the awarding procedure for port concessions in order to enhance sustainability of container terminal operations?" In order to do so three building blocks are determined that will provide the information. These three building blocks are, - Concession awarding process, - Evaluation methods for port concessions, - Environmental themes. Container terminal concessions are increasingly awarded via a competitive process. This competitive process can consist of private bilateral negotiation or container terminal concessions can be awarded through an open call for tender. In the awarding process environmental criteria are underexposed but already present in the form of existing legislation and permits. The use of environmental awarding criteria is virtually absent in ports with the exception of Maasvlakte 2. For Maasvlakte 2 concessions an environmental management system and modal split criteria have been used as environmental awarding criteria. The developed evaluation method for port tenders does not differ from other investment projects. The Net <b>Present</b> <b>Value</b> <b>technique</b> is used to determine the added value of the container terminal investment for the port authority. The net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>technique</b> is incorporated in the business case which is an analysis of to determine whether an investment for the port authority is worthwhile. The weighed sum is an evaluation model is the most widely applied evaluation model for tenders. The European Commission implicitly refers to use the weighted sum as evaluation model to evaluate the outcome of a tender process. The establishment of weighting is ultimately determined by political decisions. The net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>technique</b> provides insight on the costs or benefits on the incorporation of environmental criteria and is used as input to apply the weighted sum technique. The combination to determine the value of a project with the net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>technique</b> and further develop an evaluation method with the method of the weighted sum provides an evaluation method to combine the best of both worlds. Environmental themes that are important for consideration in the awarding process of container terminals are: - Air quality, - Energy consumption, - Intensification in use of space, - Water quality management, - Noise, - Light - Preservation and development of nature. These themes have come forth out of desk research and the conducted expert interviews. The themes are reviewed by experts in interviews to judge the feasibility of the themes for the construction of awarding criteria. For the port authorities, an expert from the Port of Rotterdam, two experts from the Port of Amsterdam and one expert of Zeeland Seaports are interviewed. To represent the terminal operators one expert of APM Terminals and one expert of Europe Container Terminals (United States Environmental Protection Agency) have been interviewed. Representing the government, three experts of the Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management were interviewed. In order maintain coherence with economic and social parts of sustainability for both these aspects of sustainability an indicator is introduced. For the economic part this indicator is profitability and for social part this indicator is employment. The combination of environmental, social and economical themes represents the sustainability framework. The interviewed experts have acknowledged that incorporation of environmental awarding criteria will stimulate environmental innovation and considering the environment is an increasing dominant factor to maintain their license-to-operate. This license-to-operate is under continuous pressure due to the general trend in society to enhance sustainability. In order to cope with the general trend in society the experts have indicated that intensification in use of space is the most important theme to enhance sustainability. Dutch ports and society are constraint by the physical constraints of the country. To be able to expand the ports’ transshipment without physical expansion benefits the port authorities and society in general. Society in general benefits due to the reason that space can therefore be utilized for other purposes, as housing or recreation for instance. Therefore an indicator for this theme is developed which is based on terminal efficiency and is calculated by the annual throughput per square meter. The second stage of this research has reviewed the feasibility to incorporate intensification of space in the awarding process. To be able to provide sensible comment on this topic, two cases were abstracted from real terminals. The straddle carrier terminal and the change needed in a rail mounted gantry crane terminal. On basis of their differences the needed change to increase sustainability in port operation is mapped. The analysis of the reference terminals was divided in a financial review, an environmental analysis and the application of the evaluation methodology. The reference terminals have revealed that in Hong Kong intensification of space is possible on basis of current practices. The reference cases served as input for the financial review. A business case served as financial review. The business case has revealed that intensification of space is financially feasible. The financial analysis has indicated the trade-off between the economic indicator, profitability and the environmental indicator, space. Based on this business case the performance measures and scoring functions for the weighted sum are constructed. Both reference container terminals are subjected to an environmental analysis based on the sustainable framework of environmental, social and economical themes. This analysis has indicated that the rail mounted gantry crane terminal will have similar of better environmental and social performance than the straddle carrier option. However, due to the higher investments needed to realize the rail mounted gantry crane terminal the profitability of this terminal is lower. To assess whether incorporation in use of space will actually enhance the sustainable performance of container terminals an expert meeting has been held. The port experts of MTBS have revealed that the total sustainability can be determined when all of the above mentioned themes are quantified. Therefore, at this stadium no conclusion can be provided whether the sustainability of container terminals is enhanced with the incorporation of space. However the The general conclusion of this research is that it is possible to enhance the environmental performance of the port by integrating environmental criteria the concession agreement. Based on reference cases the financial, technical and environmental feasibility of the environmental criteria can be determined. The input following from the business case can be used as input for the evaluation model. The application of the weighted sum technique will determine the performance measures and scoring functions of the environmental criterion. When incorporating environmental criteria in the awarding procedure it is important to consider that the environmental criteria are measureable and are attributable to the party responsible. The incorporation of environmental criteria will lead to additional costs without generating additional revenues for port authority and terminal operator. However, from the expert interviews follows that incorporation of environmental criteria is necessary to respond to the general trend in society where environment is becoming an increasingly important topic to maintain their license-to-operate. This implies that environmental criteria have great potential to be incorporated in the near future.

Such joint activities require significant information-sharing and joint decision making, and pose significant risks for both companies. Motivated by a real contractual agreement, we examine contracts which permit each of the two partnering firms to opt out during the development of a particular project. If the opt-out option is exercised, ownership of the project is transferred to the other company. In return, the sole owner will make pre-agreed milestone and royalty payments to the opting out party as the project proceeds. To analyze the economic effects that opt-out clauses have on value-sharing and the efficiency of the development process, we built a simple model which is based on the prevalent risk-adjusted net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> valuation <b>technique</b> used in the biopharmaceutical industry. We show that giving the smaller party a unilateral opt-out option is efficient in the sense that it would see the project through to development for all scenarios in which the project was economical if developed by a single party. However, such a unilateral opt-out option constrains value-sharing and will allocate a significant share of the expected value generated by the project to the biotech company. To re-balance the value sharing without requiring a large upfront side-payment by the biotech company, we introduce a double-opt out option which allows either party t...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new meta-heuristic approach technique for optimal location and sizing of multi-unit Flexible Alternating Currents System (FACTS) device installation using single- and multi-objective problems. It also considers techno-economic {{impact in the}} system. In this research, the first objective is to develop heuristic technique SingleObjective Particle Swarm Optimization (SOPSO) for optimal location and sizing of single-unit FACTS device installation with loss minimization, voltage monitoring and {{taking into account the}} cost of installation in the system. The verification was conducted through comparative studies with Single-Objective Evolutionary Programming (SOEP) and Single-Objective Artificial Immune System (SOAIS) techniques. The effect of weight coefficient, c 1 and c 2 and the effect of population size of loss minimization are also investigated. The second objective is to determine the location and sizing of multi-unit and multi-type FACTS device installation using SOPSO and SOEP. Consequently, the third objective of this research is to develop a new meta-heuristic technique termed as Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization (EPSO) for optimal placement and sizing of multi-unit FACTS device with single-objective problem. Comparative studies with respect to traditional PSO and classical EP techniques indicated that EPSO has its merit in terms of loss minimization. In addition, the cluster formation of FACTS device installation is also derived from the obtained results. The cluster formation of FACTS device installation was derived by looking at how many times (frequency) the load buses are selected for FACTS device installation identified by EPSO, PSO and EP techniques. The fourth objective in this research is to develop a new optimization technique termed as sigma-Multi-Objective EPSO (σ-MOEPSO) technique for optimal location and sizing of FACTS devices installation for multi-objective problem to minimize the transmission loss and cost of installation in power system. Finally, the fifth objective is to assess the techno-economic impact of FACTS device installation in power system. This assessment is performed by using a hybrid Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization - Net <b>Present</b> <b>Value</b> (EPSO-NPV) for assessing the impact of FACTS devices installation in duration up to 20 years. Comparative study has been done with Evolutionary Programming - Net <b>Present</b> <b>Value</b> (EP-NPV) <b>technique.</b> It was found that the proposed technique has been able to produce better performance as compared to other techniques and could be beneficial to power system planner in order to perform FACTS devices installation scheme for the minimization of loss and cost in their systems...|$|R
