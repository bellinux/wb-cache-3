5|$|The five-year {{survival}} rate for endometrial adenocarcinoma following appropriate treatment is 80%. Most women, over 70%, have FIGO stage I cancer, {{which has the}} best prognosis. Stage III and especially Stage IV cancers has a worse prognosis, but these are relatively rare, occurring in only 13% of cases. The median survival time for stage III-IV endometrial cancer is nine to tenmonths. Older age indicates a worse prognosis. In the United States, white women have a higher {{survival rate}} than black women, who tend to develop more aggressive forms of the disease {{by the time of}} their diagnosis. Tumors with high <b>progesterone</b> receptor expression have a good prognosis compared to tumors with low <b>progesterone</b> receptor expression; 93% of women with high <b>progesterone</b> receptor disease survived to threeyears, compared with 36% of women with low <b>progesterone</b> receptor disease. Heart disease is {{the most common cause of}} death among those who survive endometrial cancer, with other obesity-related health problems also being common.|$|E
5|$|The luteal {{phase is}} {{the final phase of}} the ovarian cycle and it {{corresponds}} to the secretory phase of the uterine cycle. During the luteal phase, the pituitary hormones FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum, which produces <b>progesterone.</b> The increased <b>progesterone</b> in the adrenals starts to induce the production of estrogen. The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself. Consequently, the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time, and the corpus luteum subsequently atrophies. Falling levels of <b>progesterone</b> trigger menstruation {{and the beginning of the}} next cycle. From the time of ovulation until <b>progesterone</b> withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin, the process typically takes about two weeks, with 14 days considered normal. For an individual woman, the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle.|$|E
5|$|After two years, Glidden {{abandoned}} {{production of}} cortisone {{to concentrate on}} Substance S. Julian developed a multistep process for conversion of pregnenolone, available in abundance from soybean oil sterols, to cortexolone. In 1952, Glidden, which had been producing <b>progesterone</b> and other steroids from soybean oil, shut down its own production and began importing them from Mexico through an arrangement with Diosynth (a small Mexican company founded in 1947 by Russell Marker after leaving Syntex). Glidden's cost of production of cortexolone was relatively high, so Upjohn decided to use <b>progesterone,</b> available in large quantity at low cost from Syntex, to produce cortisone and hydrocortisone.|$|E
5|$|In 1940 Julian {{was able}} to produce 100lb of mixed soy sterols daily, which had a value of $10,000 ($ today) as sex hormones. Julian was soon ozonizing 100 pounds daily of mixed sterol dibromides. The soy {{stigmasterol}} was easily converted into commercial quantities of the female hormone <b>progesterone,</b> and the first pound of <b>progesterone</b> he made, valued at $63,500 ($ today), was shipped to the buyer, Upjohn, in an armored car. Production of other sex hormones soon followed.|$|E
5|$|Mice {{have been}} used as an {{experimental}} system to investigate possible mechanisms by which levels of sex steroid hormones might regulate nervous system function. During the part of the mouse estrous cycle when <b>progesterone</b> is highest, the level of nerve-cell GABA receptor subtype delta was high. Since these GABA receptors are inhibitory, nerve cells with more delta receptors are less likely to fire than cells with lower numbers of delta receptors. During the part of the mouse estrous cycle when estrogen levels are higher than <b>progesterone</b> levels, the number of delta receptors decrease, increasing nerve cell activity, in turn increasing anxiety and seizure susceptibility.|$|E
5|$|Other {{topics of}} {{research}} have included investigations into mannitol, dexamethasone, <b>progesterone,</b> xenon, barbiturates, magnesium, calcium channel blockers, PPAR-γ agonists, curcuminoids, ethanol, NMDA antagonists, caffeine.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} levels of ovarian hormones {{at different stages of}} the cycle have been used to explain eating behaviour changes. <b>Progesterone</b> has been shown to promote fat storage, causing a higher intake of fatty foods during the luteal phase when <b>progesterone</b> levels are higher. Additionally, with a high estrogen level dopamine is ineffective in converting to noradrenaline, a hormone which promotes eating, therefore decreasing appetite. In humans, the level of these ovarian hormones during the menstrual cycle have been found to influence binge eating.|$|E
5|$|Julian also {{extracted}} stigmasterol, {{which took}} {{its name from}} Physostigma venenosum, the west African calabar bean that he hoped could serve as raw material for synthesis of human steroidal hormones. At about this time, in 1934, Butenandt and Fernholz, in Germany, had shown that stigmasterol, isolated from soybean oil, could be converted to <b>progesterone</b> by synthetic organic chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{transcriptional}} regulation of EFS, but several transcriptional regulators for EFS have been proposed based on consensus binding sites in its promoter region for ATF (Activating transcription factor), NF-κβ, NF-κβ1, GATA-3, C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha), glucocorticoid receptors α and β, and p53. Expression of isoforms 1 and 2 has been detected in multiple tissues, with maximal expression in the placenta, and the embryonal central nervous system, heart, testes and lungs. Although its expression has been reported as lower in thymus and lymphocytes, functional studies of EFS to date have best defined it as important for immune system function. One screen for implantation-related genes regulated by <b>progesterone</b> found that EFS was downregulated by 17β-estradiol and <b>progesterone</b> in explants of late proliferative phase endometrium.|$|E
5|$|On April 5, 1952, {{biochemist}} Durey Peterson and microbiologist Herbert Murray at Upjohn {{published the}} first report of a fermentation process for the microbial 11α-oxygenation of steroids in a single step (by common molds of the order Mucorales). Their fermentation process could produce 11α-hydroxyprogesterone or 11α-hydroxycortisone from <b>progesterone</b> or Compound S, respectively, which could then by further chemical steps be converted to cortisone or 11β-hydroxycortisone (cortisol).|$|E
5|$|Improvements of {{existing}} birth control methods are needed, as around {{half of those}} who get pregnant unintentionally are using birth control at the time. A number of alterations {{of existing}} contraceptive methods are being studied, including a better female condom, an improved diaphragm, a patch containing only progestin, and a vaginal ring containing long-acting <b>progesterone.</b> This vaginal ring appears to be effective {{for three or four}} months and is currently available in some areas of the world. For women who rarely have sex, the taking of the hormonal birth control levonorgestrel around the time of sex looks promising.|$|E
5|$|In early pregnancy, {{levels of}} estrogen, <b>progesterone,</b> {{estradiol}} increase, leading to breast growth {{in preparation for}} lactation. It has been hypothesized that if this process is interrupted by an abortionbefore full maturity (differentiation) in the third trimesterthen more immature cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy. These immature cells could then be exposed to carcinogens and hormones over time, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer. This mechanism was first proposed and explored in rat studies conducted in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Many {{mammalian}} serpins {{have been}} identified that share no obvious orthology with a human serpin counterpart. Examples include numerous rodent serpins (particularly some of the murine intracellular serpins) {{as well as the}} uterine serpins. The term uterine serpin refers to members of the serpin A clade that are encoded by the SERPINA14 gene. Uterine serpins are produced by the endometrium of a restricted group of mammals in the Laurasiatheria clade under the influence of <b>progesterone</b> or estrogen. They are probably not functional proteinase inhibitors and may function during pregnancy to inhibit maternal immune responses against the conceptus or to participate in transplacental transport.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} {{phases of}} the menstrual cycle correlate with women’s moods. In some cases, hormones released during the menstrual cycle can cause behavioral changes in females; mild to severe mood changes can occur. The menstrual cycle phase and ovarian hormones may contribute to increased empathy in women. The natural shift of hormone levels during the different {{phases of the}} menstrual cycle has been studied in conjunction with test scores. When completing empathy exercises, women in the follicular stage of their menstrual cycle performed better than women in their midluteal phase. A significant correlation between <b>progesterone</b> levels {{and the ability to}} accurately recognize emotion was found. Performances on emotion recognition tasks were better when women had lower <b>progesterone</b> levels. Women in the follicular stage showed higher emotion recognition accuracy than their midluteal phase counterparts. Women were found to react more to negative stimuli when in midluteal stage over the women in the follicular stage, perhaps indicating more reactivity to social stress during that menstrual cycle phase. Overall, it has been found that women in the follicular phase demonstrated better performance in tasks that contain empathetic traits.|$|E
5|$|The herd {{thrived on}} Llandudno's Great Orme; by 2001 {{they reached a}} {{population}} of 250, and {{were in danger of}} running out of food. Following complaints about goats wandering into people's gardens, the council rejected proposals for a cull, deciding to use a combination of rehoming and birth control. RSPCA marksmen tranquilised nannies and inserted contraceptive <b>progesterone</b> implants to control the numbers of the genetically unique breed. By 2007, 85 goats had been relocated to areas including Kent, Yorkshire, the Brecon Beacons and Somerset, but further efforts were interrupted by an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{secretory}} {{phase is}} {{the final phase of}} the uterine cycle and it corresponds to the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle. During the secretory phase, the corpus luteum produces <b>progesterone,</b> which plays a vital role in making the endometrium receptive to implantation of the blastocyst and supportive of the early pregnancy, by increasing blood flow and uterine secretions and reducing the contractility of the smooth muscle in the uterus; it also has the side effect of raising the woman's basal body temperature.|$|E
5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{include both}} an estrogen and a progestogen. Estrogen negative {{feedback on the}} anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation. Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular breakthrough bleeding. Several combined hormonal contraceptives—the pill, NuvaRing, and the contraceptive patch—are usually used {{in a way that}} causes regular withdrawal bleeding. In a normal cycle, menstruation occurs when estrogen and <b>progesterone</b> levels drop rapidly. Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a week) has a similar effect of causing the uterine lining to shed. If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, combined hormonal contraceptives may be taken continuously, although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding.|$|E
5|$|During early pregnancy, type 1 lobules {{quickly become}} type 2 lobules because {{of changes in}} {{estrogen}} and <b>progesterone</b> levels. Maturing into type 3 and then reaching full differentiation as type 4 lobules requires an increase of human placental lactogen (hPL) which occurs {{in the last few}} months of pregnancy. According to the abortionbreast cancer hypothesis, if an abortion were to interrupt this sequence then it could leave a higher ratio of type 2 lobules than existed prior to the pregnancy. Russo and Russo have shown that mature breast cells have more time for DNA repair with longer cell cycles, accounting for the slightly reduced risk of breast cancer for parous women against the baseline risk for women who have never conceived and those who have conceived and terminated their pregnancies.|$|E
5|$|Hormonal {{therapy is}} only {{beneficial}} in {{certain types of}} endometrial cancer. It was {{once thought to be}} beneficial in most cases. If a tumor is well-differentiated and known to have <b>progesterone</b> and estrogen receptors, progestins may be used in treatment. About 25% of metastatic endometrioid cancers show a response to progestins. Also, endometrial stromal sarcomas can be treated with hormonal agents, including tamoxifen, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, letrozole, megestrol acetate, and medroxyprogesterone. This treatment is effective in endometrial stromal sarcomas because they typically have estrogen and/or progestin receptors. Progestin receptors function as tumor suppressors in endometrial cancer cells. Preliminary research and clinical trials have shown these treatments to have a high rate of response even in metastatic disease.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Richard Richter {{developed}} the first intrauterine device made from silkworm gut, which was further developed and marketed in Germany by Ernst Gräfenberg {{in the late}} 1920s. In 1951, a chemist, named Carl Djerassi from Mexico City made the hormones in <b>progesterone</b> pills using Mexican yams. Djerassi had chemically created the pill but was not equipped to distribute them to patients. Meanwhile, Gregory Pincus and John Rock {{with help from the}} Planned Parenthood Federation of America {{developed the}} first birth control pills in the 1950s, such as mestranol/noretynodrel, which became publicly available in the 1960s through the Food and Drug Administration under the name Enovid. Medical abortion became an alternative to surgical abortion with the availability of prostaglandin analogs in the 1970s and mifepristone in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Julian founded his own {{research}} firm, Julian Laboratories, Inc. He brought {{many of his}} best chemists, including African-Americans and women, from Glidden to his own company. Julian won a contract to provide Upjohn with $2 million worth of <b>progesterone</b> (equivalent to $ million today). To compete against Syntex, {{he would have to}} use the same Mexican yam Mexican barbasco trade as his starting material. Julian used his own money and borrowed from friends to build a processing plant in Mexico, but he could not get a permit from the government to harvest the yams. Abraham Zlotnik, a former Jewish University of Vienna classmate whom Julian had helped escape from the Holocaust, led a search to find a new source of the yam in Guatemala for the company.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to endometrial carcinomas, the uncommon endometrial stromal sarcomas are cancers that {{originate in the}} non-glandular connective tissue of the endometrium. They are generally non-aggressive and, if they recur, can take decades. Metastases to the lungs and pelvic or peritoneal cavities are the most frequent. They typically have estrogen and/or <b>progesterone</b> receptors. The prognosis for low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma is good, with 60–90% five-year survival. High-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma (HGUS) has a worse prognosis, with high rates of recurrence and 25% five-year survival. HGUS prognosis is dictated by {{whether or not the}} cancer has invaded the arteries and veins. Without vascular invasion, the five-year survival is 83%; it drops to 17% when vascular invasion is observed. Stage I ESS has the best prognosis, with five-year survival of 98% and ten-year survival of 89%. ESS makes up 0.2% of uterine cancers.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} oestrus itself, when the female is {{receptive}} to the male, lasts about 24 hours, and observations have placed its recurrence between 21 and 25 days. Rhinos in the Cincinnati Zoo have been observed copulating for 30–50 minutes, similar in length to other rhinos; observations at the Sumatran Rhinoceros Conservation Centre in Malaysia have shown a briefer copulation cycle. As the Cincinnati Zoo has had successful pregnancies, and other rhinos also have lengthy copulatory periods, a lengthy rut may be the natural behavior. Though researchers observed successful conceptions, all these pregnancies ended in failure {{for a variety of}} reasons until the first successful captive birth in 2001; studies of these failures at the Cincinnati Zoo discovered the Sumatran rhino's ovulation is induced by mating and it had unpredictable <b>progesterone</b> levels. Breeding success was finally achieved in 2001, 2004, and 2007 by providing a pregnant rhino with supplementary progestin.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} more {{concerning}} in pregnancy {{due to the}} increased risk of kidney infections. During pregnancy, high <b>progesterone</b> levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, {{which leads to a}} greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys. While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present they do have a 25–40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms—treatment is recommended. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to seizures). Some women have UTIs that keep coming back in pregnancy and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections.|$|E
5|$|Equally {{challenging}} for {{women are the}} physiological and emotional changes associated with the cessation of menses (menopause or climacteric). While typically occurring gradually {{towards the end of}} the fifth decade in life marked by irregular bleeding the cessation of ovulation and menstruation is accompanied by marked changes in hormonal activity, both by the ovary itself (oestrogen and <b>progesterone)</b> and the pituitary gland (follicle stimulating hormone or FSH and luteinizing hormone or LH). These hormonal changes may be associated with both systemic sensations such as hot flashes and local changes to the reproductive tract such as reduced vaginal secretions and lubrication. While menopause may bring relief from symptoms of menstruation and fear of pregnancy it may also be accompanied by emotional and psychological changes associated with the symbolism of the loss of fertility and a reminder of aging and possible loss of desirability. While menopause generally occurs naturally as a physiological process it may occur earlier (premature menopause) as a result of disease or from medical or surgical intervention. When menopause occurs prematurely the adverse consequences may be more severe.|$|E
25|$|With oral administration, <b>progesterone</b> {{is rapidly}} metabolized in the {{gastrointestinal}} tract and liver. As many as 30 different metabolites {{have been found}} to be formed from <b>progesterone</b> with oral ingestion. Regardless of the route of administration, 5α-reductase is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of <b>progesterone</b> and is responsible for approximately 60 to 65% of its metabolism. 5β-Reductase is also a major enzyme in the metabolism of <b>progesterone.</b> 5α-Reduction of <b>progesterone</b> occurs predominantly in the intestines (specifically the duodenum), whereas 5β-reduction occurs almost exclusively in the liver. The metabolites of <b>progesterone</b> produced by 5α-reductase and 5β-reductase (after further transformation by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) are allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, respectively. With oral administration of <b>progesterone,</b> they occur in circulation at very high and in fact supraphysiological concentrations that are well in excess of those of <b>progesterone</b> itself (peak concentrations of 30ng/mL for allopregnanolone and 60ng/mL for pregnanolone versus 12ng/mL for <b>progesterone</b> at 4hours after a single 200-mg oral dose of <b>progesterone).</b>|$|E
25|$|Routes of {{administration}} that <b>progesterone</b> {{has been used}} by include oral, intranasal, transdermal/topical, vaginal, rectal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intravenous injection. Oral <b>progesterone</b> {{has been found to be}} inferior to vaginal and intramuscular <b>progesterone</b> in terms of absorption (low) and clearance rate (rapid). Intravaginal <b>progesterone</b> is available in the forms of <b>progesterone</b> gel, rings, and suppositories or pessaries. Advantages of intravaginal <b>progesterone</b> over oral administration include high bioavailability, rapid absorption, avoidance of first-pass metabolism, sustained plasma concentrations, and a local endometrial effect, while advantages of intravaginal <b>progesterone</b> relative to intramuscular injection include greater convenience and lack of local injection site pain.|$|E
25|$|Topical <b>progesterone</b> {{is usually}} {{supplied}} {{in the form}} of creams and water-based gels, and the studies in which very low levels of <b>progesterone</b> in circulation were observed with topical <b>progesterone</b> used these formulations. However, a study of topical <b>progesterone</b> {{in the form of}} an alcohol-based gel found relatively high concentrations of <b>progesterone</b> in circulation that corresponded to luteal phase levels, and were theoretically sufficient to confer endometrial protection.|$|E
25|$|The {{hormonal}} action of <b>progesterone</b> {{was discovered in}} 1929. Pure crystalline <b>progesterone</b> was isolated in 1934 and its chemical structure was determined. Later that year, chemical synthesis of <b>progesterone</b> was accomplished. Shortly following its chemical synthesis, <b>progesterone</b> began being tested clinically in women. In 1934, Schering introduced <b>progesterone</b> as a pharmaceutical drug under the brand name Proluton. It was administered by intramuscular injection because it <b>progesterone</b> rapidly inactivated after being taken by mouth and when used by mouth required very high doses to produce an effect.|$|E
25|$|Though no {{formulation}} of <b>progesterone</b> is approved for use via sublingual administration, {{a few studies}} have investigated the use of <b>progesterone</b> by this route. A study of sublingual <b>progesterone</b> for luteal support in patients undergoing embryo transfer found that after sublingual administration of 50 or 100nbsp&mg <b>progesterone</b> dissolved in a 1nbsp&mL suspension, peak levels of <b>progesterone</b> were reached in 30 to 60 minutes and were on average 17.61nbsp&ng/mL with the 100-mg dose. However, the duration was short and re-administration had to be done two or three times per day for adequate circulating levels of <b>progesterone</b> to be maintained throughout the day. Another study found that sublingual <b>progesterone</b> had to be administered at a dose of 400nbsp&mg every 8nbsp&hours to achieve circulating levels similar to those produced by 100nbsp&mg/day intramuscular <b>progesterone.</b> Further clinical research is necessary {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} <b>progesterone</b> via the sublingual route of administration.|$|E
25|$|<b>Progesterone</b> {{is used in}} {{non-pregnant}} {{women with}} a delayed menstruation {{of one or more}} weeks, in order to allow the thickened endometrial lining to slough off. This process is termed a <b>progesterone</b> withdrawal bleed. The <b>progesterone</b> is taken orally for a short time (usually one week), after which the <b>progesterone</b> is discontinued and bleeding should occur.|$|E
25|$|The steroid <b>progesterone</b> {{has been}} found to {{modulate}} the activity of CatSper (cation channels of sperm) voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Since eggs release <b>progesterone,</b> sperm may use <b>progesterone</b> as a homing signal to swim toward eggs (chemotaxis).|$|E
25|$|The use of <b>progesterone</b> and its analogues {{have many}} medical applications, both to address acute {{situations}} and {{to address the}} long-term decline of natural <b>progesterone</b> levels. Because of the poor bioavailability of <b>progesterone</b> when taken by mouth, many synthetic progestins have been designed with improved bioavailability by mouth and have been used long before <b>progesterone</b> formulations became available. Uses of <b>progesterone</b> include hormone replacement therapy, prevention of preterm birth and miscarriage, fertility support, and treatment of gynecological conditions. Additional uses of <b>progesterone</b> may include treatment of hypertension (due to its antimineralocorticoid effects), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and benzodiazepine withdrawal (due to its neurosteroid effects).|$|E
25|$|Historically, <b>progesterone</b> {{has been}} widely used in the {{treatment}} of premenstrual syndrome. A Cochrane review found insufficient evidence for or against the effectiveness of <b>progesterone</b> for this indication. Another review of 10 studies found that <b>progesterone</b> was not effective for this condition, although it stated that insufficient evidence is available currently to make a definitive statement on <b>progesterone</b> in premenstrual syndrome.|$|E
25|$|<b>Progesterone</b> {{was first}} {{isolated}} in pure form in 1934. It first became {{available as a}} medication later that year. Oral micronized <b>progesterone</b> (OMP), which first allowed <b>progesterone</b> to be taken by mouth, was introduced in 1980. A large number of manufactured progestogens, or progestins, have been derived from <b>progesterone</b> and are used as medications as well. Examples include medroxyprogesterone acetate and norethisterone.|$|E
