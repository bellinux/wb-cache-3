40|$|Thesis (M. S., Electrical and Electronic Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2014. This thesis {{discusses}} the different strategies used to perform <b>peak</b> load <b>shaving</b> through {{the means of}} distributed generation and energy storage systems from the Utility???s perspective. <b>Peak</b> load <b>shaving,</b> {{sometimes referred to as}} load leveling or peak shifting, consists of the schemes used to eliminate the peaks and valleys in the load profile. This practice offers vast benefits to utilities in cost generation, line loss reduction, and volt support which is further discussed. Prior work for <b>peak</b> load <b>shaving</b> has been mainly focused on approaches such as linear and dynamic programming, and heuristic approaches such as particle-swarm optimization. The proposed algorithm here is based on a simple approach which compares the load profile with its average in a certain period and shares the charge/discharge among the energy storage devices based on defined weighting factors. In particular, the thesis focuses on the usage of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and distributed generations to accomplish this task. Results show that the proposed algorithm offers a simple, fast and effective way for peak-load shaving without heavy computational burdens often needed in other methods. As a result, it can be easily implemented in the Utility main substation for controlling the charge/discharge of storage devices throughout the distribution system.

30|$|The most {{prominent}} roles of ESS to ADSs are elected to be optimal objectives: 1) <b>peak</b> load <b>shaving</b> and valley load filling aiming at deferral of system investment, 2) restraining the volatility {{with the purpose}} of alleviating the fluctuation of load and REGs, and 3) improving the reserve capability of ESS seeking to take some degree of responsibility for system support.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — As {{the yearly}} {{electric}} energy demand grows, {{there is a}} significant increase in the penetration of distributed generation (DG) to fulfil this increase in demand. Interconnecting DG to an existing distribution system provides various benefits to several entities. DG provides an enhanced power quality, higher reliability of the distribution system and can <b>peak</b> <b>shaves</b> and fill valleys. However, the integration of DG into existing networks has associated several technical, economical and regulatory questions. Distribution system design and planning are key features for determining the best expansion strategies to provide reliable and economic services to the customer. Transfer of electric energy from the source of generation to the customer via the transmission and distribution networks is accompanied by losses. The majority of these losses occur on the distribution system. Placement of distributed generators on the distribution system can lead to a reduction in power losses. Reduction of I 2 R losses in distribution system is very essential to improve the overall efficiency of power delivery...|$|R
40|$|Prompted by {{technical}} {{issues that have}} arisen due to the widespread deployment of distributed intermittent renewable generators, rapidly rising peak demand and reductions in battery price, the use of battery-based energy storage systems in power networks is on the rise. While battery-based energy storage {{has the potential to}} deliver technical benefits, the best possible sizing, location and usage govern the financial viability. The objective of this study is twofold. Firstly, a generalised approach is proposed to model network upgrade deferral as a function of load growth rate, renewable generation penetration and <b>peak</b> <b>shave</b> fraction. This model is then used for the formulation of an optimisation problem which benefits from multi-period power flow analysis to co-optimise battery size, location, charge/discharge profile for a pre-specified number of units to be deployed in a given distribution network. The proposed approach is implemented using the generic algebraic modelling system platform and validated on an Australian medium voltage distribution network under multiple practical and potential future scenarios...|$|R

30|$|The {{planning}} of ESS in ADSs should consider not only minimizing of costs, but also significant roles of ESS.

5000|$|Solar prices, subsidies, net {{metering}} rules, and technology are all elements that determine {{the value of}} solar energy.

50|$|It can {{be derived}} from the load profile of the {{specific}} device or system of devices. Its value is always less than one because maximum demand is always higher than average demand, since facilities likely never operate at full capacity for the duration of an entire 24-hour day. A high load factor means power usage is relatively constant. Low load factor shows that occasionally a high demand is set. To service that peak, capacity is sitting idle for long periods, thereby imposing higher costs on the system. Electrical rates are designed so that customers with high load factor are charged less overall per kWh. This process along with others is called load balancing or <b>peak</b> <b>shaving.</b>|$|E
30|$|It {{is noted}} that NaS in Case 2 {{has the largest}} scope of power {{variation}} because of the largest power rating and energy capacity, which means the strongest ability of power regulation. Meanwhile, we also find that the discharging power outputs in Case 1 fluctuate around 25  kW during TOU peak time 10 to 13, and hit a low of 5.99  kW at time 13, {{which means that the}} NaS has a small effect on <b>peak</b> load <b>shaving</b> during TOU <b>peak</b> time 10 – 13 in Case 1.|$|R
30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that for the <b>peak</b> load <b>shaving</b> application, the control of TCLs is with high {{frequency}} base (often on one or multiple minutes), and the system dispatch is with low frequency base (often 15 – 60 minutes, depending on different electricity market structures). Therefore, we simply use the notations t and t' to denote the time indices of the system dispatch interval and the TCL control interval, respectively. We also use the notations T and T' to denote the total number of the system dispatch intervals and the TCL control intervals, respectively.|$|R

This paper attempts to identify possible load profile changes just from consumption reduction activities. The results suggest that in order to achieve <b>peak</b> load <b>shaving</b> the rollout of smart meters and energy efficiency activities should be coupled with dynamic pricing systems such as time-of-use tariffs or real time prices...|$|R
50|$|Load {{management}}, {{also known}} as demand side management (DSM), {{is the process of}} balancing the supply of electricity on the network with the electrical load by adjusting or controlling the load rather than the power station output. This can be achieved by direct intervention of the utility in real time, by the use of frequency sensitive relays triggering the circuit breakers (ripple control), by time clocks, or by using special tariffs to influence consumer behavior. Load management allows utilities to reduce demand for electricity during peak usage times (<b>peak</b> <b>shaving),</b> which can, in turn, reduce costs by eliminating the need for peaking power plants. In addition, some peaking power plants can take more than an hour to bring on-line which makes load management even more critical should a plant go off-line unexpectedly for example. Load management can also help reduce harmful emissions, since peaking plants or backup generators are often dirtier and less efficient than base load power plants. New load-management technologies are constantly under development — both by private industry and public entities.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{algorithm}} to identify degradation in batteries used for power system applications. Unlike conventional battery control methods {{that try to}} extend battery lifetime by applying heuristic rules, this approach allows us to maximize battery lifetime within an optimal control frame-work. We use an online Least Squares (LS) identification method to develop a two-dimensional degradation map that describes the lost battery charge {{as a function of}} the battery state of charge and the applied current. We project the degradation map to an economic cost function that associates each discrete control action with its utilization cost. Additionally, we develop a nonlinear battery model to capture fast battery dynamics including the rate capacity effect and we identify its parameters with a nonlinear LS method. We demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by presenting a model predictive control (MPC) scheme for a <b>peak</b> <b>shave</b> application in which we use a linearized version of the battery model along with the degradation cost function. We use a high-fidelity lithium ion electrochemical battery model to simulate a real battery system and we show that the MPC scheme increases the battery lifetime by a factor of 2. 6 and the internal rate of return by 11 percentage points as compared to conventional control approaches.
