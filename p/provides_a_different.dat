5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder and Scully hear, and {{promptly}} investigate, a story about an alien abduction of two teenagers.

5|$|Modules {{and weapons}} are built using a {{resource}} {{represented by a}} lug nut. This resource slowly accrues on its own, but destroyed targets drop varying amounts that can be collected by moving the cursor over them. Each corporation <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> type of cargo, which must be placed or arranged according to its characteristics. One corporation provides simple cargo crates, {{as well as a}} mechanic module that can produce more cargo crates during the mission in order to increase the mission reward. Another corporation provides passenger modules, which must face outward, limiting space for weapons.|$|E
5|$|The story {{picks up}} {{approximately}} {{two weeks after}} the events of Guilty Gear X. In the time following Dizzy's disappearance, the mysterious Post-War Administration Bureau begins secretly investigating the Gears and fighters from previous tournaments for their own needs and ambitions. To achieve their goals the organization has created several mechanical copies of Ky Kiske, the “Robo-Kys”. In addition, fighters find themselves in a reality beyond their control, most notably in the manipulative hands of the villainess I-No, who is revealed to be a servant of “That Man”, the creator of the Gears.

25|$|But the use {{of stable}} models in answer set {{programming}} <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> perspective on such programs. In that programming paradigm, a given search problem is represented by a logic program so that the stable models of the program correspond to solutions. Then programs with many stable models correspond to problems with many solutions, and programs without stable models correspond to unsolvable problems. For instance, the eight queens puzzle has 92 solutions; to solve it using answer set programming, we encode it by a logic program with 92 stable models. From this point of view, logic programs with exactly one stable model are rather special in answer set programming, like polynomials with exactly one root in algebra.|$|E

25|$|On 25 June, {{a flight}} of 256th IAP MiGs engaged four Sabres over Anshan without result. The {{regiment}} {{was transferred to the}} new Dapu airfield on 30 June as a result of heavy attacks on Anshan. On 4 July, while repulsing airstrikes against the power grid of the Sui-ho Dam, the regiment claimed an F-86, on a day that the 190th suffered heavy losses on. In July, flying ace Vladimir Zabelin became the acting regimental commander after Semenyuk fell ill and was evacuated. On 20 July Zabelin claimed an F-86 over Dapu airfield. On 6 August, the regiment had several dogfights with F-86s while sweeping the air over Antung airfield. The 256th IAP lost a MiG whose pilot bailed out on the next day, and on 9 August, the regiment suffered its final loss when Senior Lieutenant Khalitov was shot down, although he safely ejected. Six pilots of the regiment were killed during the deployment. According to Thomas Polak in his 1999 book on Soviet aces, the regiment shot down 16 Sabres while losing sixteen MiGs during the deployment. Mikhail Bykov <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> figure in his 2014 book, with the 256th IAP claiming 18 F-86s while losing 20 MiGs.|$|E

A second class change may be optionally performed at level 38, again split between a light and a dark choice, if the player has obtained a required rare item for the target class. The class changes do not affect the plot of the game, only gameplay.|$|E

500|$|Former President Felipe Calderon made {{taking down}} drug kingpins a {{security}} priority {{of his political}} administration (2006–2012). His aggressive campaign against organized crime successfully removed many drug cartel leaders from Mexico's leading drug trafficking organizations. However, his strategy has also been criticized for sparking more violence. When a drug baron is arrested or killed, the criminal organization may experiences a leadership void, which leads to infighting for succession, possible fragmentation, and new competition from other crime syndicates. This practice, {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "kingpin strategy", worked to bring down the hegemony of the Cali and the Medellín Cartels in Colombia in the 1990s. But its implementation in Mexico has brought more violence and has led to instability in the criminal underworld. However, the Mexican government <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> interpretation of the strategy. They suggest that violence does not increase in Mexico's already violent states, and that troops are sent when violence already exists in an area. Therefore, the strategy is a product, not the cause, of the violence.|$|E
500|$|In 1963, 50 {{years after}} the premiere, Monteux (then aged 88) agreed to conduct a {{commemorative}} performance at London's Royal Albert Hall. According to Isaiah Berlin, {{a close friend of}} the composer, Stravinsky informed him that {{he had no intention of}} hearing his music being [...] "murdered by that frightful butcher". Instead he arranged tickets for that particular evening's performance of Mozart's opera The Marriage of Figaro, at Covent Garden. Under pressure from his friends, Stravinsky was persuaded to leave the opera after the first act. He arrived at the Albert Hall just as the performance of The Rite was ending; composer and conductor shared a warm embrace in front of the unaware, wildly cheering audience. Monteux's biographer John Canarina <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> slant on this occasion, recording that by the end of the evening Stravinsky had asserted that [...] "Monteux, almost alone among conductors, never cheapened Rite or looked for his own glory in it, and he continued to play it all his life with the greatest fidelity".|$|E

[...] The wingman will then be unavailable throughout the next stage. [...] Each wingman <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> form of assistance to the player: Slippy Toad scans boss enemies and displays their shields on the player's screen.

Student exchange in Australia, depending on the state, must be managed by registered exchange organisations or the school chosen for study must be registered.

[...] Four boats from Dale commanded by Lt Craven, under the protective cover of Dale commandeered a Mexican schooner without resistance. [...] The Following day, 1 October 1847, Lt Craven with 50 sailors plus marines landed. [...] Under barrage of round shell and shot from Dale the Mexican forces abandoned the village and were pursued up the valley by Lt Craven's forces. [...] Craven's forces scoured the valley for {{a distance of about}} three miles coming under occasional light assault from ambush. [...] Lt Craven, fearing the possibility than his men were being led into an ambush, returned with his men to Dale. [...] Lt Craven when patrolling later off Mulege on the Liberta gathered intelligence that actually only 100 fighters were in the Mulege area on 2 Oct.|$|E
2500|$|In 184 BC Flamininus was {{expelled}} from the Senate by the Censor, Cato the Elder, reportedly for unbecoming conduct during his consulship. In a speech before the Senate, Cato accused Flamininus {{of a number of}} charges, including being a pederast, a practice which he had picked up in Greece. Cato reported that during his consulship, Flamininus took his mistress with him to the north of Italy. Whilst there, a noble Boii and his family sought sanctuary in Flamininus’ tent. As the mistress had often told Flamininus that she had never seen a man die, the consul turned to her and asked her whether she wanted to see a Gaul die. The Boii noble was still speaking through an interpreter when Flamininus ordered his lictor to behead the Boii noble. However Anthony Everitt <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> possible version of events. On page 305 of his book The Rise of Rome he says that Flamininus had been jokingly enticed by his young male lover and prostitute, Phillipus the Carthaginian, to make up for dragging Phillipus away from Rome and missing the Gladiatorial games, upon which Flamininus had a Celt seeking asylum called in and ran him through personally with his gladius. Everitt goes on to explain, on page 448, [...] "There are variations on this story, one being that the boy was a girl, another that the man killed was a condemned criminal rather than a distinguished Celt, a third that the prostitute requested the execution and, finally, that the deed was done by the lictor, not the consul himself. However in his account of the affair, Livy (39 42) claims to have read the speech Cato made about the affair, {{and there is no reason}} to doubt him. Cato's version is likely to be the nearest to the truth." ...|$|E
