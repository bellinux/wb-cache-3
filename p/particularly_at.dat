5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} in {{the winter}} of 2010–11 rediscovered the remains of the old castle wall and ditch, and more than 400 artefacts were removed for storage at the Isle of Wight County Museum. Cowes Castle is a distinctive landmark in yachting and powerboat events, <b>particularly</b> <b>at</b> the start and finish of local races. It is protected under UK law as a 2* Listed Building.|$|E
5|$|At {{all times}} of day, but <b>particularly</b> <b>at</b> peak hours, {{it is common}} for {{vehicles}} to have to queue beyond the next ferry departure.

25|$|The bleaches used {{to remove}} {{unwanted}} fungal stains from wood include two-part peroxide bleach and solutions of sodium hypochlorite. The former is <b>particularly</b> effective <b>at</b> removing the natural colour of wood {{before it is}} recoloured with pigmented stains or dyes. Oxalic acid is <b>particularly</b> effective <b>at</b> removing iron stains from wood.|$|R

5|$|However, {{the game}} was noted to have some flaws. The game was criticized for its uneven {{difficulty}}. Reviewers have also noted some difficulty in getting the game to recognize the correct Celestial Brush patterns, as well as excessive amounts of dialog, <b>particularly</b> <b>at</b> the introduction, which was also hampered by the computer-generated voices used instead of voice acting.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, the hotel's {{management}} {{sought to}} create more elaborate features {{to compete with the}} other modern Las Vegas developments. The Forum Shops at Caesars opened in 1992; {{it was one of the}} first venues in the city where shopping, <b>particularly</b> <b>at</b> high-end fashion house stores, was an attraction in itself. A new redevelopment opened on October 22, 2004.|$|E

Pariente's fork-marked lemur is found in the Sambirano region in the northwest, and the pale fork-marked lemur is in the west of the island.|$|E

5|$|The {{call of the}} Siberian accentor is a trisyllabic ti-ti-ti. The male's song, given {{from the}} top of a bush or tree, is a loud, high chirichiriri, {{variously}} described as {{similar to that of the}} Japanese accentor, the dunnock or the black-throated accentor. Breeding birds sing most vigorously early in the season, <b>particularly</b> <b>at</b> dawn, and some individuals may also sing on migration.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} trigeminal neuralgia, {{in which one}} side of the face is exquisitely painful, is thought to be {{compression}} of the nerve by an artery as the nerve emerges from the brain stem. An acoustic neuroma, <b>particularly</b> <b>at</b> the junction between the pons and medulla, may compress the facial nerve (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII), leading to hearing and sensory loss on the affected side.|$|E
5|$|Today, erosion {{caused by}} ship {{movements}} {{on the nearby}} Canal has left considerable portions of the Diolkos in a poor state, <b>particularly</b> <b>at</b> its excavated western end. Critics who blame the Greek Ministry of Culture for continued inactivity have launched a petition to save and restore the registered archaeological site.|$|E

5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot {{as the center of}} a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with distance from the hotspot, <b>particularly</b> <b>at</b> the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating than most of the chain. Another possible explanation is that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E
5|$|A {{statement}} in the House of Lords on 13 May 1959 promised further reform, and a detailed White Paper was published in December. In November 1960 a Bill based on that report {{was introduced in the}} House of Lords, where it was much scrutinised by solicitors and barristers (<b>particularly</b> <b>at</b> the Committee stage) owing to its complexity. The Bill received its royal assent on 3 August 1961, and passed into law as the Trustee Investments Act 1961.|$|E
5|$|As the {{aircraft}} aged, the avionics {{were viewed as}} lacking suitable components for the ground attack mission, such as terrain-following radar, GPS navigation or modern night-flight systems; consequently, several upgrades were {{carried out in the}} mid-1990s, including the addition of the Litening targeting pod. India placed an order for 17 additional upgraded Jaguar aircraft from Hindustan Aeronautics in 1999 and a further 20 in 2001–2002. The Indian Air Force plans to upgrade up to 125 Jaguars starting in 2013 by upgrading the avionics (including multi mode radar, auto-pilot and other changes) as part of the DARIN III programme and is considering fitting more powerful engines, Honeywell F125IN to improve performance, <b>particularly</b> <b>at</b> medium altitudes.|$|E

5|$|Bird {{species with}} a {{restricted}} range {{are especially vulnerable}} to human activities, and eight of the 26 bird species occurring only in the Northern Maluku Endemic Bird Area are threatened, including the invisible rail. Almost {{a quarter of all}} rail species have conservation concerns, and flightless island species are <b>particularly</b> <b>at</b> risk, at least 15 species having become extinct since 1600. The estimated population of the invisible rail is 3,500–15,000 birds, and its restricted range and small population mean that the species is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although this rail is so poorly known that it may be more common than the estimates suggest.|$|E
5|$|Hansell lectured on {{the theory}} of {{precision}} air attack throughout his life, <b>particularly</b> <b>at</b> the United States Air Force Academy and the Air War College. He authored three books on air strategy: The Air War Plan That Defeated Hitler (1972), The Strategic Air War Against Japan (1980), and Strategic Air War Against Germany and Japan: A Memoir (1986). Hansell continued to study modern weapons systems, becoming an advocate of the Strategic Defense Initiative and the B-2 Spirit bomber. However his main focus was in promoting technical advances in precision guided weapons to make precision bombing more practical and therefore more desirable as a military strategy.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other animals}} {{at the highest}} trophic levels, the killer whale is <b>particularly</b> <b>at</b> risk of {{poisoning}} from bioaccumulation of toxins, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). European harbor seals have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated {{with high levels of}} PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the Washington coast found PCB levels in killer whales were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbor seals. Blubber samples in the Norwegian Arctic show higher levels of PCBs, pesticides and brominated flame-retardants than in polar bears. When food is scarce, killer whales metabolize blubber for energy, which increases pollutant concentrations in their blood.|$|E
