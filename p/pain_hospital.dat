40|$|INTRODUCTION: Four port laparoscopic {{cholecystectomy}} {{has been}} a standard procedure for removal of gall bladder. Each additional port gives more morbidity to the patient. Research continues to devise procedures which are more patient friendly. Reducing the number of port s has been postulated to be superior in terms of requirement of analgesics, hospital stay, cosmesis and cost. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Comparison of three port and four port laparoscopic cholecystectomy in terms of Operating time, Safety of the procedure, Need for the additional ports, Postoperative <b>pain,</b> <b>Hospital</b> stay and Cosmesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 100 patients with symptomatic gall stone disease were managed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

40|$|Purpose: For the {{treatment}} of acute appendicitis, a conventional laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) has been widely per-formed. Recently, the use of {{single incision laparoscopic surgery}} (SILS) is increasing because it is believed to have advan-tages over conventional laparoscopic surgery. In this study, we compared SILS and a conventional LA. Methods: We analyzed the 217 patients who received laparoscopy-assisted appendectomies between August 2010 and April 2012 at Inje University Sanggye Paik Hospital. One hundred-twelve patients underwent SILS, and 105 patients un-derwent LA. For the two groups, we compared the operation times, postoperative laboratory results, postoperative <b>pain,</b> <b>hospital</b> stay, and postoperative complications. Results: The patients ’ demographics, including body mass index, were not significantly different between the two groups. There were 6 perforated appendicitis cases in the SILS group and 5 cases in the LA group.

40|$|The {{advantages}} and {{applications of the}} videolaparoscopic technique (VL) versus open surgery {{in the treatment of}} acute and complicated appendicitis are not well defined. Our study examined 150 patients, 67 males and 83 females. They underwent surgery for acute appendicitis in emergency. The choice between open or laparoscopic tecnique was due to patient's clinical conditions and surgeon's experience. Two of these patients had no infiammatory process. Eleven patients were affected by gynaecological diseases. The last 137 patients underwent surgery for acute appendicitis and the diagnosis was confirmed. Among them, 35 (25 %) were affected by a complicated appendicitis with diffuse or clearly defined peritonitis. In 134 patients the surgery was completed laparoscopically. The conversion rate was 2 %. Morbility rate was 3 %, due to intra abdominal abscesses secondary to acute complicated appendicitis. The mean operative time was 76 min and the mean hospital stay was 4. 8 days. The death rate was 0 %. In our experience, laparoscopic appendectomy has significant advantages over traditional open surgery in both acute and complicated appendicitis, especially in young women. In this way, we can diagnose pelvic disease that could be characterized by the same symptoms of acute appendicitis, then we suggest laparoscopic appendectomy even just to complete the diagnostic iter.

Although {{there are so many}} {{technique}} of inguinal hernia repair, no one technique is taken as the ideal technique till date, as there are advantages and disadvantage in each technique. Availability of resources is one of the important factor to choose the technique of inguinal hernia repair. OBJECTIVE To compare outcome between tailored plug and patch hernioplasty and Lichtenstein tension free hernioplasty in regards of post op pain, analgesic requirement, hospital stay, post op complications and recurrence. MATERIALS AND METHODS 120 inguinal hernia patients admitted for operation in the dept. of surgery, Mac Gann hospital Shivamogga were included in the study. 60 patients were operated by plug and patch and 60 patients were operated by Lichtenstein patch technique. Data was collected in terms of operating time, post of <b>pain,</b> <b>hospital</b> stay, and return to normal work and recurrences. Student t test was used for analyses. RESULTS For plug and patch patients, mean operating time was 43. 07 mins. For Lichtenstein patient it was 59. 43 mins. (p< 05). Mean hospital stay for plug and patch was 2. 90 days and for Lichtenstein patch repair it was 4. 90 days which was statistically significant.

Three-dimensional (3 D) laparoscopic systems have stereoscopic vision in which depth perception {{is achieved by}} different unique images received by each eye. We evaluated 3 D laparoscopy in comparison with conventional 2 D laparoscopy in urological procedures in a prospective randomized study. Materials and Methods: Over a 19 month study period, 108 patients scheduled to undergo various urological procedures were randomized to either conventional 2 D or 3 D laparoscopy (2 D n = 53; 3 D n = 55). A single senior surgeon performed all the surgeries. Parameters such as total operative time, dissection and suturing time, blood loss, hospital stay, complications (Clavien-Dindo), and visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain were assessed. The subjective assessment of the operating surgeon of superiority and inferiority of either technology on parameters defining surgical skills was recorded using a Likert scale. Results: The total operative time (P < 0. 0003), blood loss (P < 0. 028), dissection, suturing and stenting time (P < 0. 0001), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults score (P < 0. 0001) was significantly in favor of 3 D laparoscopy. Post operative <b>pain,</b> <b>hospital</b> stay, and complications after surgery were similar in both groups. The subjective assessment of the operating surgeon also favored the 3 D system. Conclusion: Our study showed significant advantages of the 3 D system over 2 D laparoscopy. These advantages include enhanced operative performance and greater surgeon comfort...|$|E

The aim of this study is to compare the results, over the last ten years, of stapled haemorrhoidopexy (SH) with those of standard Milligan Morgan haemorrhoidectomy (M&M). Furthermore, we discuss the proper indications for each technique in terms of the lowest rate of complications and long-term results. Methods: Three hundred forty-three patients with different degrees of symptomatic haemorrhoids underwent SH or M&M from January 2005 to December 2007. Patients were divided in two groups age and sex matched. The administration of painkillers drugs, antibiotics and laxatives, complication symptoms and hospital stay in all the patients were recorded after surgical treatment. Results: The mean operative time was shorter in the stapled group compared to that in the open group (31 minutes versus 40 minutes). Postoperative <b>pain,</b> <b>hospital</b> stay and return to full activity were shorter in the stapled group. There was a significant difference in the wound healing time between the two groups. We noticed a bigger rate of recurrence in patients, treated with stapled haemorrhoidectomy for fourth degree haemorrhoids. Conclusions: According to our experience, the Longo technique is indicated for the treatment of hemorrhoids of II and III degree. In the latter grades of prolapse, however, the Milligan Morgan haemorrhoidectomy can also be applied with good results. We believe, however, that in case of irreducible prolapse the M&M is to be preferred.
