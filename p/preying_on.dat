5|$|Their {{habit of}} <b>preying</b> <b>on</b> bees makes them a {{nuisance}} to bee-keepers, but farmers attract {{them to their}} fields using artificial perches in fields {{to encourage them to}} feed on pest insects.|$|E
5|$|After a 13 hour chase {{across the}} Atlantic on 12 September 1810, Aigle {{captured}} a French privateer from Bordeaux: Phoenix, armed with eighteen 18-pounder carronades {{and carrying a}} well trained crew of 129, had been successfully <b>preying</b> <b>on</b> British and American shipping.|$|E
5|$|Kittens may {{be taken}} by several predators, {{including}} owls, eagles, foxes, coyotes, and bears, {{as well as other}} adult male bobcats; when prey populations are not abundant, fewer kittens are likely to reach adulthood. Golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) have been reportedly observed <b>preying</b> <b>on</b> bobcats.|$|E
50|$|These cones are generalists. They are: molluscivorous (they <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> {{gastropods}} and bivalves); vermivorous (they <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> polychaete marine worms); and piscivorous (the also <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> fish).|$|R
5|$|P. labiata {{does not}} <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> ants, but is <b>preyed</b> <b>on</b> by the ants Oecophylla smaragdina and Odontomachus sp. (species uncertain).|$|R
50|$|When Barbary stags and gazelles became {{scarce in}} the Atlas Mountains, lions <b>preyed</b> <b>on</b> herds of {{livestock}} that were rather carefully tended. They also <b>preyed</b> <b>on</b> wild boar and red deer.|$|R
5|$|The Al Khalifa {{family moved}} from Qatar to Bahrain in 1799. Originally, their {{ancestors}} were expelled from Umm Qasr in central Arabia by the Ottomans {{due to their}} predatory habits of <b>preying</b> <b>on</b> caravans in Basra and trading ships in Shatt al-Arab waterway until Turks expelled them to Kuwait in 1716, where they remained until 1766.|$|E
5|$|Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly <b>preying</b> <b>on</b> insects, {{on other}} spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods. The most common {{procedure}} is sighting the prey, stalking, fastening a silk safety line to the surface, using the two pairs of back legs {{to jump on the}} victim, and finally biting the prey. Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day, so that they maximize their chances of a catch.|$|E
5|$|As an apex predator, Daspletosaurus {{was at the}} top of {{the food}} chain, {{probably}} <b>preying</b> <b>on</b> large dinosaurs like the ceratopsid Centrosaurus and the hadrosaur Hypacrosaurus. In some areas, Daspletosaurus coexisted with another tyrannosaurid, Gorgosaurus, though there is some evidence of niche differentiation between the two. While Daspletosaurus fossils are rarer than other tyrannosaurids', the available specimens allow some analysis of the biology of these animals, including social behavior, diet and life history.|$|E
5|$|The eastern {{green mamba}} {{has a few}} natural predators. Humans, mongooses, snake eagles, and genets {{commonly}} <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> this species of mamba. Hornbills and other snakes tend to <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> juvenile green mambas.|$|R

2500|$|In {{vegetation}} {{near the}} shoreline of Lake Victoria, social jumping spiders build dense nest complexes, in which P. africana hunts. The assassin bugs Nagusta sp. indet. and Scipinnia repax [...] <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> P. africana, and S. repax also <b>preys</b> <b>on</b> Nagusta.|$|R
5|$|Known {{from several}} well-preserved skulls and {{abundant}} skeletal material, Majungasaurus has recently {{become one of}} the best-studied theropod dinosaurs from the Southern Hemisphere. It appears to be most closely related to abelisaurids from India rather than South America or continental Africa, a fact that has important biogeographical implications. Majungasaurus was the apex predator in its ecosystem, mainly <b>preying</b> <b>on</b> sauropods like Rapetosaurus, and {{is also one of the}} few dinosaurs for which there is direct evidence of cannibalism.|$|E
5|$|Potamon fluviatile has a generalist diet, {{feeding on}} {{vegetable}} debris, scraping algae from surfaces, or <b>preying</b> <b>on</b> frogs, tadpoles, and various invertebrates, such as insect larvae, snails or worms. No predator seems to specialise on P.fluviatile, {{but a number}} of animals take it opportunistically, including rats, foxes, weasels, birds of prey and jays. The most significant predator may be mankind, with individual prospectors able to catch 3,000 to 10,000 in one season.|$|E
5|$|Tarbosaurus {{lived in}} a humid {{floodplain}} criss-crossed by river channels. In this environment, it was an apex predator {{at the top of}} the food chain, probably <b>preying</b> <b>on</b> other large dinosaurs like the hadrosaur Saurolophus or the sauropod Nemegtosaurus. Tarbosaurus is represented by dozens of fossil specimens, including several complete skulls and skeletons. These remains have allowed scientific studies focusing on its phylogeny, skull mechanics, and brain structure.|$|E
50|$|Damselfly nymphs are aquatic, and <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> small aquatic insects {{or other}} aquatic larvae. The adult damselflies <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> small flying insects, caught using their legs like a basket to scoop the prey up while flying, or insects taken from leaves.|$|R
50|$|In {{vegetation}} {{near the}} shoreline of Lake Victoria, social jumping spiders build dense nest complexes, in which P. africana hunts. The assassin bugs Nagusta sp. indet. and Scipinnia repax <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> P. africana, and S. repax also <b>preys</b> <b>on</b> Nagusta.|$|R
50|$|The cougar <b>preys</b> <b>on</b> birds, deer, sloths, mice, frogs, agoutis, and lizards. In {{spite of}} coexisting {{with the larger}} jaguar, in places like Sangay National Park in Ecuador, the cougar's prey tends to be small. They rarely <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> domesticated animals.|$|R
5|$|While {{almost all}} jumping spiders are predators, mostly <b>preying</b> <b>on</b> insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods, Phaeacius does not use the usual hunting tactics. Most jumping spiders walk {{throughout}} the day, so that they maximise their chances of a catch, and jump on their prey and then bite it. Unlike most jumping spiders, Phaeacius and other spartaeines do not leap on prey, but lunge from about half the predator's body length away.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} will occasionally prey {{on large}} mammals, such as deer, but will usually do so when fish and smaller prey levels go down. Rarely, American alligators {{have been observed}} killing and eating bobcats, but such events are not common and have little effect on bobcat populations. Although American alligators have been listed as predators of West Indian manatees, very little evidence exists of such predation. In the 2000s, when invasive Burmese pythons occupied the Everglades, American alligators have been recorded <b>preying</b> <b>on</b> them, possibly controlling populations, thus preventing the invasive species to spread up north.|$|E
5|$|Another fossil {{from the}} Yixian Formation {{provides}} direct evidence of Psittacosaurus as a prey animal. One skeleton of Repenomamus robustus, a large triconodont mammal, is preserved with {{the remains of}} a juvenile Psittacosaurus in its abdominal cavity. Several of the juvenile's bones are still articulated, indicating that the carnivorous mammal swallowed its prey in large chunks. This specimen is notable in that it is the first known example of Mesozoic mammals <b>preying</b> <b>on</b> live dinosaurs. Heavy predation on juvenile Psittacosaurus may have resulted in R-selection, the production of more numerous offspring to counteract this loss.|$|E
40|$|First {{observations}} are reported of predator-prey relationships among gastropod mollusks of the depauperate, Indo-West Pacific derivative, intertidal and shallow subtidal benthic fauna of Easter Island. Conus miliaris, {{which will be}} reported in detail in a separate paper, and Pisania decapitata englerli <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> polychaete annelids; Mitraflavocingulata <b>preys</b> <b>on</b> sipunculans; and Neothais nesiotes <b>preys</b> <b>on</b> barnacles intertidally and gastropods subtidally.

5|$|Ants form {{symbiotic}} {{associations with}} a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either <b>preying</b> <b>on</b> ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.|$|E
5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} the life habits of Macabeemyrma ovata {{may have been}} similar to extant Myrmeciinae ants. The ant is large with long legs and elongated mandibles. It presumably had large eyes {{that were used to}} hunt for prey and navigation, and the ant was possibly equipped with a sting. Colonies most likely nested in the soil like most other Myrmeciinae, but like some Myrmecia species it is possible they were an arboreal nesting species. Workers were solitary foragers, foraging on the ground or onto vegetation while <b>preying</b> <b>on</b> arthropods. Workers most likely did not recruit other ants to food sources or lay down pheromone trails.|$|E
5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} the life habits of extinct Myrmeciinae ants including Prionomyrmex {{may have been}} similar to extant ants within the subfamily. These ants foraged {{on the ground and}} possibly onto trees and low vegetation while <b>preying</b> <b>on</b> arthropods. These ants may have collected plant nectar, as Myrmecia species use this as a food source. Workers may have not recruited nest mates to food sources or lay down pheromone trails, as these ants were solitary hunters. Workers would have relied on their vision to hunt for prey and help themselves navigate.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{it being}} one of the most venomous snakes in Central and South America, the snake is often <b>preyed</b> <b>on</b> by spiders, {{specifically}} the Goliath tarantula. The Jaguar will also <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> the snake as well, if it is able to find it.|$|R
25|$|The triangulate cobweb spider {{is known}} to <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> many other types of arthropods, ants (including fire ants), other spiders, pillbugs, and ticks. It <b>preys</b> <b>on</b> several other spiders {{believed}} to be harmful to humans, including the hobo spider and the brown recluse.|$|R

5|$|As {{the most}} {{abundant}} large predator in the Morrison Formation, Allosaurus {{was at the top}} of the food chain, probably <b>preying</b> <b>on</b> contemporaneous large herbivorous dinosaurs, and perhaps even other predators. Potential prey included ornithopods, stegosaurids, and sauropods. Some paleontologists interpret Allosaurus as having had cooperative social behavior, and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses. It may have attacked large prey by ambush, using its upper jaw like a hatchet.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{occupy a}} wide range of {{ecological}} positions. While some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements. Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the niches occupied by different species of birds vary, with some species feeding in the forest canopy, others beneath the canopy, and still others on the forest floor. Forest birds may be insectivores, frugivores, and nectarivores. Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or kleptoparasitism. Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised scavengers. Avivores are animals that are specialised at <b>preying</b> <b>on</b> birds.|$|E
5|$|Decaying {{organic matter}} {{is a primary}} diet for many species. This can range from dung, which is {{consumed}} by coprophagous species (such as certain scarab beetles in the Scarabaeidae), to dead animals, which are eaten by necrophagous species (such as the carrion beetles, Silphidae). Some beetles found in dung and carrion are in fact predatory. These include members of the Histeridae and Silphidae, <b>preying</b> <b>on</b> the larvae of coprophagous and necrophagous insects. Many beetles feed under bark, some feed on wood while others feed on fungi growing on wood or leaf-litter. Some beetles have special mycangia, structures for the transport of fungal spores.|$|E
