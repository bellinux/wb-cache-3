5|$|The Texas {{pocket gopher}} avoids {{emerging}} {{onto the surface}} to feed by seizing the roots of plants with its jaws and pulling them downwards into its burrow. It also practices coprophagy. The African <b>pouched</b> <b>rat</b> forages on the surface, gathering anything that might be edible into its capacious cheek pouches until its face bulges out sideways. It then returns to its burrow to sort through the material it has gathered and eats the nutritious items.|$|E
5|$|Rodents have {{sensitive}} olfactory abilities, {{which have}} been used by humans to detect odors or chemicals of interest. The Gambian <b>pouched</b> <b>rat</b> is able to detect tuberculosis bacilli with a sensitivity of up to 86.6%, and specificity (detecting the absence of the bacilli) of over 93%; the same species has been trained to detect land mines. Rats have been studied for possible use in hazardous situations such as in disaster zones. They can be trained to respond to commands, which may be given remotely, and even persuaded to venture into brightly lit areas, which rats usually avoid.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{experiments}} with the Gambian giant <b>pouched</b> <b>rat,</b> {{also known as}} the African giant <b>pouched</b> <b>rat,</b> have indicated that it has the required sensitivity to smell, can be trained reliably with food-reward incentives, and is typically too small to set off the mines. These rats also offer a local solution to many African countries because they are indigenous to East Africa. These rats are trained by a non-profit, research organization called APOPO and are called HeroRATs.|$|E
5000|$|A Belgian non-government organization, APOPO, trains Gambian <b>pouched</b> <b>rats</b> (Cricetomys gambianus) {{to sniff}} out land mines and tuberculosis.

50|$|<b>Pouched</b> <b>rats</b> {{are found}} {{throughout}} much of sub-Saharan Africa {{with the exception of}} southern Africa. They are characterized by having large cheek pouches and a distinctive molar morphology. The molars are very similar to the type seen in the subfamily Murinae, but <b>pouched</b> <b>rats</b> probably evolved this similarity through convergent evolution.|$|R
50|$|A Tanzanian social {{enterprise}} founded by two Belgians, APOPO, trains Gambian <b>pouched</b> <b>rats</b> to detect land mines and tuberculosis with their highly developed sense of smell. The trained <b>pouched</b> <b>rats</b> are called HeroRATS. The rats are cheaper to train than mine-detecting dogs; a rat requires $7,300 {{for nine months}} of training, whereas a dog costs about $25,000 for training.|$|R
25|$|In mid-2003, due to {{cross-contamination}} at a Madison, Wisconsin-area pet swap from an unquarantined Gambian <b>pouched</b> <b>rat</b> {{imported from}} Ghana, several prairie dogs in captivity acquired monkeypox, and subsequently a few humans were also infected. This led the CDC and FDA {{to issue a}} joint order banning the sale, trade, and transport within the United States of prairie dogs (with a few exceptions). The disease was never introduced to any wild populations. The European Union also banned importation of prairie dogs in response. While largely seen by exotic pet owners and vendors as unfair, the monkeypox scare {{was not the only}} zoonosis incident associated with prairie dogs.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pouched</b> <b>rats</b> are a {{group of}} African rodents in the {{subfamily}} Cricetomyinae.

50|$|The Gambian <b>pouched</b> <b>rat</b> {{has very}} poor {{eyesight}} and so {{depends on its}} senses of smell and hearing. Its name comes from the large, hamster-like pouches in its cheeks. It is not a true rat but {{is part of an}} African branch of muroid rodents. It typically weighs between 1 and 1.4 kg. In its native Africa, the <b>pouched</b> <b>rat</b> lives in colonies of up to twenty, usually in forests and thickets, but also commonly in termite mounds. It is omnivorous, feeding on vegetables, insects, crabs, snails and other items, but apparently preferring palm fruits and palm kernels.|$|E

40|$|A {{thriving}} {{population of}} Gambian giant <b>pouched</b> <b>rats</b> became established on Grassy Key, a 550 -ha island in Florida, following escape(s) from an exotic pet breeder. After {{existence of the}} population was verified, computer models indicated that Gambian giant <b>pouched</b> <b>rats</b> could successfully invade a large portion of North America if they reached the mainland. This largest of rat species is highly prolific, and its dispersal to the mainland could result in substantial negative impacts to agriculture, environment, and wildlife. Additionally, Gambian giant <b>pouched</b> <b>rats</b> are known vectors of a variety of diseases transmissible to humans and livestock. The first action to counter the severe and immediate threat of dispersal was to rapidly develop the information necessary on which to base an eradication program. The information included detection and monitoring technologies, population indexing methodologies, population distribution, habitat preferences, trapping methodology, acceptance of bait matrices, and efficacy tests of toxicants, and bait stations that minimize exposure to native species. With these tools forming a foundation, a pilot eradication was funded for Crawl Key, a 150 -ha key adjoining Grassy Key to which the species expanded its range. The aims of the pilot eradication were to test and fine-tune the methods prior to implementing full-scale eradication on Grassy Key. No Gambian giant <b>pouched</b> <b>rats</b> were found in two subsequent surveys of Crawl Key. Further surveys of Grassy Key were used to refine bait station densities for the full scale eradication effort implemented on Grassy Key in spring 2007. The eradication effort is on-going...|$|R
