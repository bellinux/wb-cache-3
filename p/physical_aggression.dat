5|$|In the ponerine ant Harpegnathos saltator, worker {{policing}} {{prevents the}} number of reproductive workers from becoming excessive. The species has gamergates, which lay eggs but rarely carry out any other tasks, so having {{too many of them}} would reduce the colony's efficiency. Gamergate numbers are rather stable, as infertile workers target newly ovipositing workers by jumping on and holding them: this efficiently inhibits them from laying eggs, and within a few weeks they revert to being subordinate and infertile workers. However, once new ovipositing workers attain a gamergate's level of ovarian activity, the infertile (policing) workers ignore them. The signal used by the policing workers consists of cuticle hydrocarbons transmitted only by direct contact, rather than being a pheromone detected by olfaction. Similarly, the inhibition of ovipositing workers is achieved by direct <b>physical</b> <b>aggression</b> by policing workers, not by any pheromone produced by queens or gamergates.|$|E
25|$|The {{frequency}} of <b>physical</b> <b>aggression</b> in humans peaks at around 2–3 years of age. It then declines gradually on average. These observations suggest that <b>physical</b> <b>aggression</b> {{is not only}} a learned behavior but that development provides opportunities for the learning and biological development of self-regulation. However, a small subset of children fail to acquire all the necessary self-regulatory abilities and tend to show atypical levels of <b>physical</b> <b>aggression</b> across development. These may be at risk for later violent behavior or, conversely, lack of aggression that may be considered necessary within society. Some findings suggest that early aggression does not necessarily lead to aggression later on, however, although the course through early childhood is an important predictor of outcomes in middle childhood. In addition, <b>physical</b> <b>aggression</b> that continues is likely occurring in the context of family adversity, including socioeconomic factors. Moreover, 'opposition' and 'status violations' in childhood appear to be more strongly linked to social problems in adulthood than simply aggressive antisocial behavior. Social learning through interactions in early childhood has been seen as a building block for levels of aggression which {{play a crucial role in}} the development of peer relationships in middle childhood. Overall, an interplay of biological, social and environmental factors can be considered.|$|E

40|$|The haplodiploïd sex-determining {{system of}} Hymenoptera, whereby males usually develop from unfertilized eggs and females from fertilised eggs, results in {{relatedness}} coefficients {{that are not}} uniform among colony members. These asymmetries in relatedness are directly affected by the genetic architecture of the colony, which in turn depends on {{various factors such as}} queen number or queen mating frequency. Relatedness asymmetries induce different fitness returns per unit investment and, as a result, conflicts over brood composition may arise among colony members. Conflicts between the queen(s) and the workers over sex ratio represent one of the most frequent conflicts in eusocial Hymenoptera. Arrhenotoky allows queens great flexibility to control the sex of their progeny, by fertilizing or not the eggs; however because workers take care of the brood, they may influence the sex ratio by preferentially rearing one sex. Another salient conflict concerns the females over reproduction. In species where workers can mate and reproduce, <b>physical</b> <b>aggressions</b> or chemical communication may lead to dominance hierarchies for access to reproduction.

Furthermore, multiple twin studies have also shown that homosexual traits displayed greater congruence in monozygotic (MZ) twins than dizygotic (DZ) twins displaying genetic contributions.

25|$|Though {{aggression}} {{can occur}} within groups, the response towards intruders of another species {{is much more}} drastic and can involve a sexual dimorphism in displays. Females typically employ scent-marking intruder response tactics, whereas males {{are more prone to}} vocalizing threats, <b>physical</b> <b>aggression,</b> and piloerection. Scent-marking in cotton-top tamarins is done in two ways: either using anogenital scent-marking, or suprapubic scent-marking. The ability to use both of these separate glandular fields for threat signals may indicate females have developed diverging evolutionary threats through differential use of these markings. These variable signals may be used to sign a territorial encounter, or serve as a reproductive signal. The intensity of female threats are generally comparable when directed at intruders of either genders. In contrast, male cotton-tops are considerably more threatening towards fellow males than towards females.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Few {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the relationship of barroom aggression with both general and barroom-specific alcohol expectancies. The present study investigated these associations in a rarely studied and high-risk population: construction tradespeople. DESIGN AND METHODS: Male construction tradespeople (n =  211) aged 18 - 35  years (M =  21. 91, SD =  4. 08  years) participated in a face-to-face questionnaire assessing general and barroom-specific alcohol expectancies and perpetration of physical and verbal barroom aggression as well as control variables, age, alcohol consumption and trait aggression. RESULTS: Sequential logistic regression analyses revealed that general alcohol-aggression expectancies of courage or dominance were not predictive of either verbal or <b>physical</b> barroom <b>aggression</b> after controlling for age, alcohol consumption and trait aggression. However, barroom-specific alcohol expectancies were associated with both verbal and <b>physical</b> barroom <b>aggression,</b> with positive associations found for expected hyper-emotionality and protective effects for expected cognitive impairment. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: In a population where rates of risky drinking and barroom aggression are high, specific expectations {{about the effects of}} drinking in bars may influence subsequent aggressive behaviour in bars.

The {{aim of this study}} was to conduct and epidemiologic study of patients attended at the Buccomaxillofacial Surgery and Traumatology Service of a regional hospital in Goiania/GO, Brazil, between 2008 and 2010. Material and methods: 521 files of patients, who had suffered maxillofacial traumatisms that resulted in a total of 615 fractures, were evaluated. The files were used to analyze gender, age, etiologic agents and distribution of fractured bones. Results: About 80 % of patients were male, whereas 20 % of the affected individuals were women. The most frequently etiologic factor found in the two groups was automobile accidents, followed by <b>physical</b> <b>aggressions</b> and falls. Concerning to fractured bones, the zygomatic complex, followed by fractures of the mandible, the nasal bones themselves, condyle and Le Fort type fractures were the most prevalent ones, in both groups. Conclusion: Knowledge of the incidence and etiologyof maxillofacial fractures is of great importance to the professionals involved in the treatment of these patients. Within this context, Buccomaxillofacial Surgery and Traumatology is increasingly being affirmed as one of the most important specialties at the emergency centers of regional hospitals concerning to the treatment of patients who are victims of traumatisms...|$|R

Such negative emotional perceptions not only created inside conflicts, but also formed “waver, yuragi “based on fluctuation which causes feeling in caring for violent residents. in addition, 『points at problems derived from care』 were identified with outside conflicts and inside conflicts.
