For small scale problems, {{the use of a}} Gaussian Process surrogate model and <b>prescreening</b> methods has proven to be effective. However, each commonly used <b>prescreening</b> method is only suitable for some types of problems, and the proper <b>prescreening</b> method for an unknown problem cannot be stated beforehand. In this paper, the four existing <b>prescreening</b> methods are analyzed and a new method, called self-adaptive lower confidence bound (ALCB), is proposed. The extent of rewarding the prediction uncertainty is adjusted on line based on the density of samples in a local area and the function properties. The exploration and exploitation ability of <b>prescreening</b> can thus be better balanced. Experimental results on benchmark problems show that ALCB has two main advantages: (1) it is more general for different problem landscapes than any of the four existing <b>prescreening</b> methods; (2) it typically can achieve the best result among all available <b>prescreening</b> methods.

40|$|Background: Screening, brief intervention, and {{referral}} to treatment (SBIRT) is an efficacious prevention practice. However, {{little research has}} assessed differences in <b>prescreening</b> outcomes between inpatient and outpatient primary care or among different <b>prescreening</b> administration methods. This study tested whether administration method (self-administered vs interview) and setting (inpatient versus outpatient) predicted <b>prescreening</b> outcomes in a large sample of primary care patients. Then, among patients who <b>prescreened</b> positive, it tested whether full screening scores differed by administration method and setting. Methods: Researchers used binomial logistic regression to assess predicted <b>prescreening</b> outcomes and analysis of variance to assess differences in SBIRT screening scores across a total of 14 447 unique patient visits in 10 outpatient sites and 1 centrally located hospital. Results: Controlling for gender, depression, and other substance use, both medical setting and method of <b>prescreening,</b> predicted <b>prescreening</b> results. Among patients who <b>prescreened</b> positive for alcohol, setting also was associated with mean screening scores. However, outcomes were not uniform by substance (eg, alcohol vs other drugs). Conclusion: The results support previous studies on this topic that had utilized cross-study comparison or that were not specific to SBIRT prescreening/screening mechanisms. At the same time, nuanced findings were observed that had not previously been reported and {{suggest the need for}} further research in this area...|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to the limited effectiveness of direct mail batch <b>prescreen,</b> financial institutions developed a new application for the concept of <b>prescreen,</b> instant <b>prescreen,</b> in 1992. The basic premise of instant <b>prescreen</b> {{is the same as}} direct mail <b>prescreen.</b> Using credit data to evaluate a consumer for a credit product without that consumer's knowledge. However, the execution of instant <b>prescreen</b> is radically different than batch <b>prescreen.</b> With instant <b>prescreen,</b> financial institutions <b>prescreen</b> new or existing customers for additional credit products in realtime at the point of contact. So instead of sending unsolicited <b>prescreen</b> offers to huge batches of unknown consumers, instant <b>prescreen</b> enables banks to offer known customers relevant credit products whenever those customers choose to contact the bank. This approach to <b>prescreen</b> focuses on deepening existing customer relationships and tends to produce higher acceptance rates than direct mail <b>prescreen.</b>|$|E
50|$|Today, batch <b>prescreen</b> is {{ubiquitous}} {{in the financial}} industry. The most common method for distributing batch <b>prescreen</b> offers is direct mail. During {{the first quarter of}} 2010, U.S consumers received 481 million direct mail <b>prescreen</b> credit offers which represents a 29 percent increase on the 372.4 million mailed {{in the first quarter of}} 2009. However, as the volume of direct mail <b>prescreen</b> offers increases, the acceptance rate of those offers tends to decrease. The reason for this inverse correlation is that the number of U.S consumers interested in responding to direct mail <b>prescreen</b> offers tends to remain relatively static. Direct Mail <b>prescreen,</b> while compelling to some consumers, just doesn't appeal to everyone. Additionally, the printing and mailing of billions of direct mail pieces a year (most of which are immediately thrown away) contributes more than 4 million tons of paper to the nation's landfills each year.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea behind}} <b>prescreen</b> is quite simple. Instead {{of waiting for}} a {{customer}} {{to ask for a}} credit product, banks can proactively screen a huge batch of consumers for a credit product and send pre-approved offers to all who pass the bank's <b>prescreen</b> criteria. The emergence of national credit bureaus and automated credit decisioning software enabled this batch <b>prescreen</b> approach to be successfully implemented at financial institutions across the country.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In high {{throughput}} cancer genomic studies, {{results from}} the analysis of single datasets often suffer {{from a lack of}} reproducibility because of small sample sizes. Integrative analysis can effectively pool and analyze multiple datasets and provides a cost effective way to improve reproducibility. In integrative analysis, simultaneously analyzing all genes profiled may incur high computational cost. A computationally affordable remedy is <b>prescreening,</b> which fits marginal models, can be conducted in a parallel manner, and has low computational cost. Results An integrative <b>prescreening</b> approach is developed for the analysis of multiple cancer genomic datasets. Simulation shows that the proposed integrative <b>prescreening</b> has better performance than alternatives, particularly including <b>prescreening</b> with individual datasets, an intensity approach and meta-analysis. We also analyze multiple microarray gene profiling studies on liver and pancreatic cancers using the proposed approach. Conclusions The proposed integrative <b>prescreening</b> provides an effective way to reduce the dimensionality in cancer genomic studies. It can be coupled with existing analysis methods to identify cancer markers. </p...|$|R

50|$|The {{concept of}} <b>prescreen</b> was {{originally}} {{conceived as a}} new, more efficient method of account acquisition for financial institutions. Traditionally, financial services were provided by small community banks. These banks offered {{a specific set of}} credit products and services that met the needs of their community. When a potential customer would walk into their branch and apply for a credit product (like a credit card for example), the bank would evaluate the consumer's credit history and {{decide whether or not to}} approve the application.However, as the financial industry consolidated in the latter half of the twentieth century, national financial institutions emerged, offering a comprehensive spectrum of credit products and services. This led to the creation of a national financial services marketplace in which new segments of profitable consumers across the country were up for grabs. <b>Prescreen</b> was developed to help banks efficiently tap this new, national pool of potential customers.|$|E

In the optimization stage, information from the <b>prescreening</b> stage is used to construct a novel superstructure which has embedded alternative retrofit designs for reassigning existing exchangers to different streams, introducing new exchangers to the network, and adding piping and area modifications. The superstructure is optimized with a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation to determine the retrofit network requiring least total annual cost. Heat loads, minimum approach temperature (EMAT), and hot stream/cold stream matches are not fixed but are optimized in order to accurately account for the tradeoffs between capital and energy cost.
