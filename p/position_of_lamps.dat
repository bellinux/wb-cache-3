Indium amalgam control of mercury vapor pressure in the lamp gives high output at lamp ambient temperatures up to 105 C.

For that reason, this paper lists the major barriers to the spread <b>of</b> compact fluorescent <b>lamps</b> in housing and analyses four of them. 16 compact fluorescent lamps were measured in a laboratory in order to study their warm-up time, their colour shift during warm-up, the impact <b>of</b> their <b>position</b> on their luminous flux and their light output equivalent, in comparison to two incandescent lamps. Measurements show that information given on the lamp package is incomplete and inaccurate.

The {{apparent}} {{relief of}} monocularly viewed surfaces reversed when {{the order of}} light and shade was reversed relative to the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> a <b>lamp</b> observed the moment earlier.

30|$|The {{technical}} design described above {{makes it possible}} to set up stratified water columns with a thermocline at 1.5 – 2  m in depth, at 3.2 – 3.7  m in depth, or at both depths. The temperature control system {{can also be used to}} create convective stirring at different rates. A slight increase in the temperature settings in one or both of the two lower sections promotes convective stirring in the water column. It is also possible to maintain convective stirring above a cooler bottom layer by a similar slight offset in the temperature settings between the middle and upper sections. Faster convective stirring can also be maintained by maximum heating at the low section and maximum cooling at the top section, thus allowing the middle section to control the overall temperature in the water column.

30|$|A 2 D finite-element {{model for}} the {{transient}} analysis of the radiative heat exchange between a rotating polymeric cylindrical pipe and the SW infrared <b>lamps</b> <b>of</b> an oven for end-forming has been devised in order to investigate the influence of cylinder angular velocity and oven configuration on the temperature distribution within the tube. Results obtained for different rotational velocities were compared with {{the case of a}} uniformly irradiated tube. A MATLAB®function for the calculation of local view factor distribution given pipe’s outer radius and oven configuration has been developed. The code was validated comparing the global view factor calculated as the sum of all local view factors with the value obtained by means of the corresponding correlation given in [15]. Comparison between the temperature distributions on the outer circumference of a static tube obtained in the cases of uniform and actual radiation distribution justifies the use of rotation devices, in order to avoid high temperature peaks which could lead to the thermal failure of the material. Simulations carried out on different pipe geometries at varying values of angular velocity demonstrated how increasing angular speed decreases the maximum temperature displacement with respect to the case of a uniformly irradiated tube. Results showed a nonlinear dependence between maximum temperature displacement and angular velocity, thus demonstrating the existence of a limiting value over which a further increase in angular velocity brings little reduction in maximum temperature difference. The same analysis also highlighted how the low thermal diffusivity of the material dampens the maximum temperature difference when moving from the outer to the inner side of the pipe. For a fixed value of the angular velocity, lower values of maximum temperature difference were obtained for smaller tubes, because of the more uniform distribution of the local view factors with respect to the angular coordinate. Moreover, as highlighted in [12], parameters which contribute to the definition of boundary conditions, such as convective heat transfer coefficients and PVC surface emissivity, do not influence temperature unevenness significantly over the pipe wall, since they just affect the mean temperature reached at a certain radial position at a given time without varying the maximum temperature displacement with respect to the case of a perfectly uniform radiation. The model {{can be used as a}} tool to characterize the end-forming process of polymeric tubes in terms of critical angular velocity, for different materials and oven configurations. Simulations showed that, for a given oven configuration, higher critical velocities are obtained for large-sized pipes, because of the much more uneven distribution of the heat flux on the outer circumference. Also, comparisons between two different oven configurations showed how relative angular <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamps</b> could lead to significant modification of the values of critical angular velocity, all the more for smaller pipes.|$|R
