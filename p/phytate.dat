5|$|Experiments {{have shown}} that when more pollen {{is applied to the}} stigma, as well as the fruit {{containing}} more seeds and being larger (the xenia effect mentioned above), the germination of the seeds is also faster and more likely, and the seedlings are larger. Various combinations of mineral nutrients and light have a significant effect during the various stages of plant growth. These effects vary significantly between the different species of Cucurbita. A type of stored phosphorus called <b>phytate</b> forms in seed tissues as spherical crystalline intrusions in protein bodies called globoids. Along with other nutrients, <b>phytate</b> is used completely during seedling growth. Heavy metal contamination, including cadmium, has a significant negative impact on plant growth. Cucurbita plants grown in the spring tend to grow larger than those grown in the autumn.|$|E
5|$|The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{refers to}} the {{collective}} set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR.

For people ages 18 and older the PRI calculations are complex, as the EFSA has set higher and higher values as the <b>phytate</b> content of the diet increases. For women, PRIs increase from 7.5 to 12.7 mg/day as <b>phytate</b> intake increases from 300 to 1200 mg/day; for men the range is 9.4 to 16.3 mg/day. These PRIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs. The EFSA reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 25mg/day, which is much lower than the U.S. value.|$|E
5|$|Despite some concerns, western vegetarians and vegans do {{not suffer}} any more from overt zinc {{deficiency}} than meat-eaters. Major plant sources of zinc include cooked dried beans, sea vegetables, fortified cereals, soy foods, nuts, peas, and seeds. However, phytates in many whole-grains and fibers {{may interfere with}} zinc absorption and marginal zinc intake has poorly understood effects. The zinc chelator <b>phytate,</b> found in seeds and cereal bran, can contribute to zinc malabsorption. Some evidence suggests that more than the US RDA (15mg) of zinc daily may be needed in those whose diet is high in phytates, such as some vegetarians. These considerations must be balanced against the paucity of adequate zinc biomarkers, and {{the most widely used}} indicator, plasma zinc, has poor sensitivity and specificity.

Copper salts, including copper gluconate, copper acetate, or copper sulfate, are more easily absorbed than copper oxides.

40|$|Sorghum and millet {{and their}} {{products}} require specialized treatment {{in order to}} improve their nutritive value, organoleptic properties and shelf-life. They contain anti-nutrients which are the major phytochemicals which negatively affects their nutritive values. The phytochemicals of concern include tannins and <b>phytates,</b> which interfere with mineral absorption, palatability and protein digestibility. Malting and fermentation treatments were applied to reduce the anti-nutrients, improve protein digestibility, and acidity to increase the products shelf life. The effects of malting and fermentation on the cereals nutritive value and anti-nutrient reduction were studied and evaluated for a period of 8 days. A treatment combining malting for 3 days and fermentation for 2 days respectively both at room temperatures (25 °C) was employed. Tannins and <b>phytates</b> were significantly reduced (p ? 0. 05) by malting and fermentation. Protein digestibility was significantly (p ? 0. 05) improved by malting and fermentation treatments; malted cereals digestibility ranged between 34. 5 - 68. 1 % while the fermented flours protein digestibility range was 97. 4 - 98. 3 %. The pH values were lowered to below 4. 0, a level at which they could effectively inhibit spoilage microorganisms {{at the end of the}} fermentation period.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{evaluated}} the iron sufficiency of the Russian diet. METHODS: Data {{were obtained from}} 24 -hour dietary recalls conducted in 4 rounds (1992 through 1994) of a nationally representative longitudinal survey of 10, 548 women and children. Iron bioavailability was estimated via algorithms adjusting for enhancers (heme, vitamin C) and inhibitors (tannins in tea, <b>phytates</b> in grains) consumed at the same meal. RESULTS: Dietary iron intakes were deficient in the most vulnerable groups: young children and women of reproductive age. Poverty status was strongly associated with deficiency. After adjustment for enhancers and inhibitors, estimated bioavailable iron intakes at 3 % to 4 % of total iron were inadequate in all women and children. CONCLUSIONS: These dietary data suggest that Russian women and children {{are at high risk}} of iron deficiency. Grain products rich in <b>phytates,</b> which inhibit absorption, were the major food source of iron in Russia. High intakes of tea and low consumption of vitamin C also inhibited iron bioavailability.

40|$|Traditional {{decortication}} of {{pearl millet}} and white sorghum by hand pounding or using a mechanical device were performed in Burkina Faso, and compared to abrasive decortication {{in the laboratory}} using the same kernel lots. Using some nutrients as histological markers, the decortication characteristics and nutritional composition (iron, zinc, <b>phytates,</b> lipids, ADF fibres and starch) of decorticated grains were measured. Decortication had numerous effects on grain composition but {{no significant differences were}} observed between the two traditional methods of decortication. The effects varied according to the type of grain mainly {{due to the fact that}} more germ was removed in sorghum than in millet, as the millet germ is more embedded in the endosperm. During abrasive decortication, zinc and lipid losses increased rapidly due to removal of the germ, particularly in sorghum. <b>Phytates</b> were shown to be located mainly in the bran and germ but also in the endosperm in millet.
