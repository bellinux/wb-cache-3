40|$|Government {{involvement}} {{is the main}} cause for the EDI acceptance in Southeast Asian countries (United Nation of Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific - UNESCAP, 1996). This is {{significantly different from the}} EDI developments in the western countries in which private sector involvement in EDI is substantial (UNESCAP, 1996). As an initial step to spur EDI implementation in private sector, the Malaysian Government has imposed all companies that engage in international trade to implement EDI by doing <b>electronic</b> <b>customs</b> declarations through CIS (Customs Information System) DagangNet. For this, the Government also spent over RM 300 million to fully implement EDI nationwide (Star, 2003 December 3). Nevertheless, such implementation is not successful and it has been claimed that “EDI is not yet fully implemented even though it had been initiated since late 1990 s, besides electronic data is also still not recognized for legal customs declaration purposes even if it was meant for paperless and <b>electronic</b> <b>customs</b> declarations” (Star, 2003 December 3).

40|$|We {{present a}} {{large-scale}} study of commonality in liquidity and resilience across assets in an ultra high-frequency (millisecond-timestamped) Limit Order Book (LOB) dataset from a <b>pan-European</b> <b>electronic</b> equity trading facility. We first show that extant work in quantifying liquidity commonality through {{the degree of}} explanatory power of the dominant modes of variation of liquidity (extracted through Principal Component Analysis) fails to account for heavy tailed features in the data, thus producing potentially misleading results. We employ Independent Component Analysis, which both decorrelates the liquidity measures in the asset cross-section, but also reduces higher-order statistical dependencies. To measure commonality in liquidity resilience, we utilise a novel characterisation as the time required for return to a threshold liquidity level. This reflects a dimension of liquidity that is not captured {{by the majority of}} liquidity measures and has important ramifications for understanding supply and demand pressures for market makers in electronic exchanges, as well as regulators and HFTs. When the metric is mapped out across a range of thresholds, it produces the daily Liquidity Resilience Profile (LRP) for a given asset. This daily summary of liquidity resilience behaviour from the vast LOB dataset is then amenable to a functional data representation. This enables the comparison of liquidity resilience in the asset cross-section via functional linear sub-space decompositions and functional regression. The functional regression results presented here suggest that market factors for liquidity resilience (as extracted through functional principal components analysis) can explain between 10 and 40 % of the variation in liquidity resilience at low liquidity thresholds, but are less explanatory at more extreme levels, where individual asset factors take effect...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present the examples of common practices developed by Internet companies, which are so widespread in the international electronic commerce that they could serve as the basis for adjudicating disputes in the online world (e-customs). Customary norms played a very important role providing norms for solving commercial disputes in the Medieval times (Law Merchant) and continue to play an important role in modern international trade. Modern judges and arbiters refer to commercial customs to interpret legal acts or to settle disputes. And numerous legally relevant practices emerged in the electronic trade, particularly in the areas of online security, electronic contracting, data protection, handling of emails etc. Governments could utilise the knowledge of Internet practices to supplement national and international regulation of electronic commerce. The knowledge of <b>electronic</b> commerce <b>customs</b> could thus enhance Internet-related legislation and make it better adjusted to the needs of the knowledge-based economy. The article also outlines the concept of Internet Law Merchant as an autonomous from the national legal systems body of Internet commerce customary practices, which could be selected by parties to a transaction as the law governing their contract.
