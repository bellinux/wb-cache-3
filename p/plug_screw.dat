40|$|Unbleached {{kraft pulp}} for making sack paper is usually first refined {{in a high}} {{consistency}} process followed by low consistency refining {{in order to achieve}} desired paper properties, such as high strain at break and high tensile energy absorption at low airflow resistance. Conventional atmospheric high consistency refining is compared to treatments using two types of compressive screw equipment, Bivis equipment and the pressure expansion (PREX) <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> feeder, commonly used in thermo mechanical pulp (TMP) plants. The <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> pretreatments were performed under atmospheric and steam-pressurised conditions at 120 °C and 130 °C. Treatment in the Bivis equipment was performed under different compressive and shear conditions. After the Bivis and <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> treatments, the pulp samples were refined in a low consistency process using the Escher-Wyss refiner. Paper properties were evaluated on freely dried sheets which were produced in order to simulate paper made under industrial sack paper drying conditions. The highest levels of the tensile energy absorption index and strain at break were achieved from curled and kinked fibres, pre-treated under the most compressive and highest shear stress conditions before low consistency refining. These results were obtained at very low airflow resistance, which is advantageous for sack paper, and with very low energy consumption during pre-treatment with the <b>plug</b> <b>screw.</b> The pulp samples pre-treated at high consistency in a <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> feeder under steam-pressurised conditions or in the Bivis equipment showed, after low consistency refining, increased shrinking ability compared to the pulp samples pre-treated in high consistency refining under atmospheric conditions...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of decreasing the sheet density of paper made from unbleached kraft pulp for the middle layer in board production. The objective was to evaluate how treatments in a compressive screw equipment pressure expansion (PREX) <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> feeder, atmospheric (HCatm) and pressurised high-consistency refining (HCpress refining) affect both fibre and paper properties and, in particular, how fibre curl affects sheet density. The <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> pre-treatments and HC refining were performed under atmospheric and steam-pressurised conditions at 100 degrees C, 125 degrees C and 175 degrees C. Even though fibre curl increased considerably during <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> treatment and HCatm and HCpress refining, {{the density of the}} paper sheets did not decrease, as had been expected. A possible explanation for this result may be that the fibres become more flexible during curl treatment, resulting in increased sheet density. In order to obtain fibres that were both very curly and stiff, three ways of improving the fibre stiffness were tested: 1) lowering the pH during refining, 2) drying the fibres (hornification) and 3) treating the fibres with 1, 2, 3, 4 -ButaneTetraCarboxylic Acid (BTCA). If the fibres are dried (hornified), there is a lowering effect on sheet density. However, fibre curl does not have any lowering effect on sheet density. If the pH is decreased during <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> treatment, the sheet density may be reduced but, again, the fibre curl does not have any positive effect on sheet density. Fibres treated with BTCA had a marked lowering effect on sheet density. With this treatment, the fibre curl does {{have a positive effect on}} sheet density. The BTCA-treated fibres were also used to lower sheet density. A mixture of 15 % by weight BTCA- treated fibres resulted in an approximately 9 % density reduction...|$|E

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis concerns the mechanical pulping process {{and the effects of}} wood source and pretreatment conditions on the pulp properties. In the first part, the deformation of Norway spruce (Picea abies) wood samples was investigated under shear and torsional loading at different temperatures (20 - 95 °C) and sulfonation conditions. The shear strength and maximum torque decreased with increased temperature. The fiber separation was found to be of the transwall type when the deformation was performed at low temperatures (20 - 60 °C). When high temperatures were combined with sulfonation, the fracture plane was transferred to the compound middle lamella region of the fiber wall, thus exposing a smoother wood surface. The effect of pretreating of wood chips intended for CTMP production was studied in a pilot plant equipped with a <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> press. Sulfonation before mechanical deformation of the chips in the screw press gave a more selective initial fiber separation in the deformed chips compared with the case where chips were allowed to pass through the screw press without prior sulfonation. The long fiber content and the energy consumption required to reach comparable freeness values were higher for the pulp produced from chips that were sulfonated before mechanical deformation in the screw press. The tear strength at constant energy consumption was also higher for this pulp, whereas the tensile strength was lower. Sulfonation of fibers, followed by polyelectrolyte adsorption analysis, was found to be an excellent method for determining surface lignin concentration. The wood raw material was shown to have an influence on the thermomechanical pulp quality: pulps from forest grown loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) (+ 30 years old) had a slightly lower bonded area at a given total surface area than pulps prepared from plantation grown loblolly pine (15 years old) containing a higher percentage of juvenile wood. This was consistent with the higher surface lignin concentration found for the pulps prepared from the forest grown wood...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveBronchopleural fistula is a {{critical}} complication that may occur after pulmonary resection. Early closure of the fistula is required to prevent thoracic empyema or aspiration pneumonia. We have designed a novel procedure for bronchoscopic occlusion of the fistula with a collagen <b>screw</b> <b>plug</b> and assessed its feasibility in an experimental animal model. MethodsAdult beagle dogs underwent right or left pneumonectomy, and the bronchial stump was closed with the Sweet method. A silicone bar (2 mm in diameter) was then placed {{in the middle of}} the bronchial stump. Seven days after the operation, the silicone bar was removed bronchoscopically, and fistula formation was confirmed. A screw-shaped 2 % collagen <b>screw</b> <b>plug</b> (20 mm long and 3 mm in diameter) was mounted at the end of a modified endoscopic cannula and then inserted into the fistula. Autologous platelet-rich plasma was then soaked onto the inserted plug. ResultsNine of 10 beagle dogs with bronchopleural fistula were treated successfully by plug occlusion. One dog died of pneumothorax caused by dislocation of the plug. Pathologic examination revealed that the collagen sponge had been replaced by fibrous tissue and that the fistula was covered with normal epithelium. Although soaking with platelet-rich plasma made the plug airtight immediately, the use of platelet-rich plasma seemed to make no distinct difference with respect to the treatment result or pathologic findings. ConclusionBronchoscopic occlusion with a collagen <b>screw</b> <b>plug</b> is a promising option for treatment of small bronchopleural fistulas after pulmonary surgery...|$|R

500|$|A {{fusible plug}} {{operates}} as a safety valve when dangerous temperatures, rather than dangerous pressures, are reached in a closed vessel. In steam engines [...] the fusible <b>plug</b> is <b>screwed</b> into the crown sheet (the top plate) of the firebox, typically extending about an inch (25mm) into the water space above. Its purpose is {{to act as a}} last-resort safety device in the event of the water level falling dangerously low: when the top of the plug is out of the water it overheats, the low-melting-point core melts away and the resulting noisy release of steam into the firebox serves to warn the operators of the danger before the top of the firebox itself runs completely dry, which could result in catastrophic failure of the boiler. The temperature of the flue gases in a steam engine firebox can reach 1000°F (550°C), at which temperature copper, from which historically most fireboxes were made, softens to a state which can no longer sustain the boiler pressure and a severe explosion will result if water is not put into the boiler quickly and the fire removed or extinguished. The hole through the plug is too small to have any great effect in reducing the steam pressure and the small amount of water, if any, that passes through it is not expected to have any great impact in quenching the fire.|$|R
2500|$|Problems arose during {{research}} in the 1950s and 1960s. For a while, engineers were faced with what they called [...] "chatter marks" [...] and [...] "devil's scratch" [...] in the inner epitrochoid surface. They discovered that the cause was the apex seals reaching a resonating vibration, and the problem was solved by reducing the thickness and weight of apex seals. Scratches disappeared after the introduction of more compatible materials for seals and housing coatings. Another early problem was the build-up of cracks in the stator surface near the plug hole, which was eliminated by installing the spark plugs in a separate metal insert/ copper sleeve in the housing, instead of <b>plug</b> being <b>screwed</b> directly into the block housing. Toyota found that substituting a glow-plug for the leading site spark plug improved low rpm, part load, specific fuel consumption by 7%, and also emissions and idle. A later alternative solution to spark plug boss cooling was provided with a variable coolant velocity scheme for water-cooled rotaries, which has had widespread use, being patented by Curtiss-Wright, with the last-listed for better air-cooled engine spark plug boss cooling. These approaches did not require a high-conductivity copper insert, but did not preclude its use.
