40|$|Abstract — <b>Pirn</b> winding is an {{operation}} of winding yarn from supply yarn package onto <b>pirns</b> {{which are used}} for shuttle weft insertion. Firm and coherent winding tension is required to maintain in the <b>pirn</b> winding process to withstand the high forces produced by the deceleration of the shuttle {{at the end of}} each pick and to avoid permanent strains in yarns which will appears as fabric defects in weaving. The package size and its diameter vary due to subsequent winding of <b>pirns.</b> Hence the balloon effect varies and caused to change the thread tension at the winding point of the <b>pirn.</b> The thread tension variation is considerably significant from the first <b>pirn</b> wound from a package to the last <b>pirn</b> wound from the same if no tension controlling mechanism is devised. Placing dead weights on the disc tension controller which adds a tension to take off tension may help to compensate the yarn tension variation to some extent to combat with this problem. However, this is a stepwise manual compensation technique which needs the correct timing of compensation to avoid significant tension variations in <b>pirn</b> windings. The author attempted to theoretically analyze the tension variation in the yarn path of the <b>pirn</b> winding machine and theoretically model the tension variation with and without deadweight placement on the tensioners. Author also verified the accuracy and the validity of the model developed through the experimental results obtained at different locations along the yarn path. ...|$|R
50|$|A <b>pirn</b> is a rod onto which {{weft thread}} is wound {{for use in}} weaving. Unlike a bobbin, it is fixed in place, and the thread is {{delivered}} {{off the end of}} the <b>pirn</b> rather than from the centre. A typical <b>pirn</b> is made of wood or plastic and is slightly tapered for most of its length, flaring out more sharply at the base, which fits over a pin in the shuttle. <b>Pirns</b> are wound from the base forward in order to ensure snag-free delivery of the thread, unlike bobbins, which are wound evenly from end to end.|$|R

5000|$|For {{one hundred}} years the weaving sheds of Lancashire had been {{equipped}} with cast iron constructed looms not dissimilar to the original Roberts loom, invented by Richard Roberts. They were driven by leather belts from line shafts. They were closely packed together in pairs with a narrow alley.

The weft was on a <b>pirn,</b> so she stopped the loom, found the shuttle, removed it, and bent the shuttle peg containing the <b>pirn</b> towards her; removed the <b>pirn</b> {{and replaced it with}} a fresh one.

5000|$|On a {{conventional}} loom, the weft thread {{is carried on}} a <b>pirn,</b> in a shuttle that passes through the shed. A handloom weaver could propel the shuttle by throwing it {{from side to side}} {{with the aid of a}} picking stick. The [...] "picking΅ on a power loom is done by rapidly hitting the shuttle from each side using an overpick or underpick mechanism controlled by cams 80-250 times a minute. [...] When a <b>pirn</b> is depleted, it is ejected from the shuttle and replaced with the next <b>pirn</b> held in a battery attached to the loom. Multiple shuttle boxes allow more than one shuttle to be used. Each can carry a different colour which allows banding across the loom.The rapier-type weaving machines do not have shuttles, they propel the weft by means of small grippers or rapiers that pick up the filling thread and carry it halfway across the loom where another rapier picks it up and pulls it the rest of the way. [...] Some carry the filling yarns across the loom at rates in excess of 2,000 metres per minute. Manufacturers such as Picanol have reduced the mechanical adjustments to a minimum, and control all the functions through a computer with a graphical user interface. Other types use compressed air to insert the pick. They are all fast, versatile and quiet.|$|R

5000|$|Shuttles were {{constructed}} from a dense heavy hardwood with metal tips. The wood was traditionally box. Imported timbers such as persimmon and cornel were also commonly used. The shuttle was shaped and hollowed using conventional wood working techniques, the metal tips are pressed onto the block. Strips of fox fur or similar were {{stuck to the}} inside of a shuttle to stop the thread ballooning as it left the <b>pirn.</b> There are many designs of shuttle. The Pemberton Loom needed a shuttle with a hinged shuttle-peg to hold the pirn; the later Draper loom shuttles clasped metal rings on the head of the <b>pirn</b> using a spring steel clip.
