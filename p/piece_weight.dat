40|$|The thesis {{summarizes}} {{findings from}} the field of initial rearing of sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus) that are currently available. The results of experimental rearing, which took place in 2014 and consisted of two parts, are included. In the first part, the impact of the exchange rate of the water in the tanks on change of hydrochemical parameters. For the experiment three variants in duplicate were prepared, with different flow rate for each one. The volume of water in the tanks was set to 100 liters and the number of fish was 150 fish/tank. Water change rate within the first variant was set for 1 / 3 of volume per hour, within the second variant for 1 / 3 of volume per hour and within the third variant for 3 / 3 of volume per hour. Each day was measured oxygen content, water temperature and pH, and samples for laboratory analysis were being taken. The results were analyzed by analysis of variance. No statistically significant difference has been found between monitored parameters, therefore these flow rates had no impact on the change of hydrochemical parameters for each variant. In {{the second part of the}} experiment was compared the effect of three different feed mixtures on growth parameters and development of fish. The same conditions of the rearing environment were maintained, but stocking density was reduced to 50 fish/gutter and a uniform water change rate of 3 / 3 volume per hour was set. The first variant was presented feed Aller Bronze 2 mm, the second variant Aller Silver 2 mm and the third variant Biomar Inicio 918 2 mm. At the beginning of the experiment, the fish reached an average <b>piece</b> <b>weight</b> of 29. 00 g and FWC 0. 44 within the first variant, 29. 70 g and FWC 0. 43 within the second variant and 29. 31 g and FWC 0. 41 within the third variant. At the end of the experiment the fish reached monitored parameters with following values: the first variant had the average <b>piece</b> <b>weight</b> of 37. 99 g, FWC 0. 41, SWGR 0. 90 %. d- 1, FCR 2. 12 kg. kg- 1 and PER 1, 01; within the second variant, the average <b>piece</b> <b>weight</b> was 40. 38 g, FWC 0. 41, SWGR 1. 02 %. d- 1, FCR 1. 82 kg. kg- 1 and PER 1. 18; within the third variant, the average <b>piece</b> <b>weight</b> was 43. 51 g, FWC 0. 40, SWGR 1. 44 %. d- 1, FCR 1. 44 kg. kg- 1 and PER 1. 46...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis for a bachelor´s degree was to experimentally evaluate possibilities of adaptation of northern pike (Esox lucius) for controlled breeding conditions in the RAS and for intake of artificial pelleted feed. Special attention {{was focused on the}} influence of light regime on the success of adaptation and the rate of cannibalism. The experiment was divided into six groups with different light regimes (L 8 : D 16, L 4 : D 8 : L 4 : D 8, L 12 : D 12, L 4 : D 4 : L 4 : D 4 : L 4 : D 4, L 16 : D 8, L 8 : D 4 : L 8 : D 4). Into each group were putted 3, 600 pieces of pike larvae, which means 20 pcs/l. Feeding was carried out manually in 15 minutes time interval. Daily mortality was recorded and biometric measurements were conducted. After 15 days, the experiment was evaluated. Adaptation for intake of pelleted feed was successful. As was found out, the light regime has the influence on survival, cannibalism and growth of northern pike in RAS. The highest final <b>piece</b> <b>weight</b> was achieved under the light regime L 16 : D 8 (W= 0, 13135 ? 0, 02924 g).

40|$|The cookie making {{properties}} of dough made from blends of commercial wheat starch and gluten were determined. Higher gluten levels decreased dough <b>piece</b> <b>weight,</b> its density, stickiness and hardness. The largest spread was obtained when no gluten was added. However, {{this resulted in}} cookies of unacceptable structure. Higher gluten contents increased spread onset time, decreased cookie spread but generally had little impact on set time while additional water lowered spread onset time and likewise had no statistically significant impact on set time. The {{results showed that the}} final cookie diameter is quite dependent on the spread onset time which itself depends on the amount of water available to the non-gluten constituents in the system. Size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography showed that during baking, proteins aggregated. This indicated that during the process the added gluten acquired the necessary mobility for interaction. However, because increasing levels of gluten increasingly decreased the relative level of water available to itself, and because the set time, and, hence, the set temperature, did not depend on the gluten level, we concluded that cookie dough setting was not determined by an ‘apparent’ glass transition. Furthermore, more protein aggregation went hand in hand with less spread. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent studies {{providing}} high-resolution {{images of}} pulmonary perfusion {{have questioned the}} classical zone model of pulmonary perfusion. Hence the present work was undertaken to provide detailed maps of regional pulmonary perfusion to examine the influence of anesthesia, mechanical ventilation, and posture. METHODS: Pulmonary perfusion was analyzed with intravenous fluorescent microspheres (15 microm) in six sheep studied in four conditions: prone and awake, prone with pentobarbital-anesthesia and breathing spontaneously, prone with anesthesia and mechanical ventilation, and supine with anesthesia and mechanical ventilation. Lungs were air dried at total lung capacity and sectioned into approximately 1, 100 pieces (about 2 cm 3) per animal. The pieces were weighed and assigned spatial coordinates. Fluorescence was read on a spectrophotometer, and signals were corrected for <b>piece</b> <b>weight</b> and normalized to mean flow. Pulmonary blood flow heterogeneity was assessed using the coefficient of variation of flow data. RESULTS: Pentobarbital anesthesia and mechanical ventilation did not influence perfusion heterogeneity, but heterogeneity increased when the animals were in the supine posture (P < 0. 01). Gravitational flow gradients were absent in the prone position but present in the supine (P < 0. 001 compared with zero). Pulmonary perfusion was distributed with a hilar-to-peripheral gradient in animals breathing spontaneously (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The influence of pentobarbital anesthesia and mechanical ventilation on pulmonary perfusion heterogeneity is small compared with the effect of changes in posture. Analysis of flow gradients indicate that gravity plays a small role in determining pulmonary blood flow distribution...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Effects {{of breast}} <b>piece</b> <b>weight</b> (thickness) on yield after {{tumbling}} {{in water and}} aqueous solutions of acetic acid, NaCl, and soybean oil for 10 and 20 min were determined. Thickness of the piece had no affect on yield when the samples were tumbled in water but addition of acetic acid, NaCl, or oil to the tumbling solution resulted in significant (P<. 05) correlations in many cases. Increased sample thickness resulted in smaller cooking loss in those samples tumbled in 10 % acetic acid,. 5 and 1 % NaCl, or 5 and 10 % soybean oil. This resulted in improved net yield as sample weight increased. Addition of NaCl (. 5 or 1. 0 %), acetic acid (5 or 10 %), or soybean oil (5 or 10 %) to the tumbling solution did not affect peak values but addition of 5 or 10 % soybean oil reduced shear values in the samples after 10 min tumbling. Oil in the solution had no affect after tumbling for 20 min. Increasing the tumbling time from 10 to 20 min produced lower peak values and shear values in samples tumbled in water, NaCl, and oil. Combination of. 5 % NaCl, 5 % acetic acid, and 5 % soybean oil to produce various tumbling solutions resulted in no changes in peak values or shear values and when tumbling time was increased from 10 to 20 min, shear parameters were not reduced. Net yield was higher when samples were tumbled in solutions containing acetic acid. Increasing tumbling time from 10 to 20 min also increased net yield in these samples.
