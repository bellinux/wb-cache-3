40|$|A solar heat {{collection}} system employing non-tracking reflectors integrated with a fixed vacuum tube receiver which achieves modest year-round concentration (about 2) of the sunlight at low capital costs is discussed. The {{axis of the}} vee-trough reflector lies in a east-west direction and requires reversal of the reflector surfaces only twice a year without disturbing the receiver tubes and associated plumbing. It collects most of the diffuse flux. The vacuum tube receiver with selective absorber has no convection losses while radiation and conduction losses are minimal.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effect of}} various substrata on the {{settlement}} of a pearl oyster, Pinctada martensii, was evaluated. The settlement of the larvae in the experiments with four different color substrata was compared and showed that deep color <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> (red and blue) attracted significantly more larvae (P < 0. 05) than light color (green and yellow). In addition, the influence of biofilm substrata was {{compared with that of}} non-film substrata of smooth or rough texture. Number of settled larvae was highest on biofilmed <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets,</b> either rough or smooth, then rough <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> without film, the least recorded was on smooth <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> without biofilm. Substrates of <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> coated with tissue extracts of the same species appeared to attract larval settlement.

40|$|Thermoforming is {{a generic}} {{term for the}} {{manufacturing}} of plastic components through a vacuum or a pressure forming process. The first and most critical phase in thermoforming is sheet heating. For a thick-gage <b>plastic</b> <b>sheet,</b> the combination of conduction and radiation energy, which conducts and transmits into the sheet interior, controls the heating cycle time. In order to predict the formability of a thick-gage sheet and improve production efficiency, {{we need to know}} the internal temperature of the <b>plastic</b> <b>sheet</b> during the heating phase in thermoforming. Unfortunately, the internal temperature of the sheet is impossible to measure directly. To overcome this problem, it is possible to use a soft-sensor technique, which uses the surface temperature of a <b>plastic</b> <b>sheet</b> that can be measured by infrared sensors to estimate the internal temperature of the sheet. A soft sensor system was defined by using a finite difference equation.
