40|$|This book {{provides}} solid {{empirical evidence}} {{into the role}} that countries and communities of origin play in the migrant integration processes at destination. Coverage explores several important questions, including: To what extent do policies pursued by receiving countries in Europe and the US complement or contradict each other? What effective contribution do they make to the successful integration of migrants? What obstacles do they put in their way? This title is the second of two complementary volumes, {{each of which is}} designed to stand alone and provide a different approach to the topic. Here, renowned contributors present evidence from the studies of 55 origin countries on five continents and 28 countries of destination in Europe where both quantitative and qualitative research was conducted. In addition, the chapters detail results of a unique worldwide survey of 900 organisations working on migrant integration and diaspora engagement. The results draw on an innovative methodology and new approaches to the analysis of large-scale survey data. This examination into the tensions between integration policies and diaspora engagement policies will appeal to academics, policymakers, integration practitioners, civil society organisations, as well as students.

This article analyses this integration through {{a case study}} of an ongoing smallholder dairy development programme in Tanzania. Value chain upgrading and innovation systems perspectives were combined in an analytical framework to interpret the findings, which show that multi-stakeholder processes enhance horizontal and vertical coordination but limit process and product upgrading. The main conclusion is that, although such processes may catalyze smallholder market inclusion, their effects are largely bounded by existing value chain structures (e. g. production system, fragmented markets), timeframe and how prevailing institutional constraints are addressed, which may constrain the intentions of such collaboration action. This calls attention to the starting points of value chain interventions and the socio-political dynamics that are part of multi-stakeholder processes. </p...|$|R

Neorealists present concerns about relative gains {{as evidence of the}} limited scope of the neoliberal theory of international cooperation. We argue that, on the contrary, neoliberalism provides theoretical tools that are indispensable to determine when and why relative-gains concerns thwart international cooperation, and that this provides a strong case for subsuming neorealism under neoliberalism in a parsimonious synthesis.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{describe}} the reception of separated minors in Sweden and analyse some central ideas and ethics as they are manifested, interpreted and practiced by professionals involved in the reception system. What impact do these ideas and ethics have on separated children? This article is based on extensive fieldwork consisting of more than 100 interviews and observations among actors in the reception system. Theories of differences and similarities are used to investigate how professionals perceive minors both as normal teenagers and as culturally different aliens who need to become “Swedish”. The study concludes that a combination of the ideas of similarities and differences, where the minors are recognised as persons with various backgrounds and experiences, could upon reflection result in a more gracious reception. About the book: These conference proceedings gather expert articles about different ways of understanding immigrant incorporation, both historically and in contemporary society. It is important to examine critically what is meant by the term "integration". Who are targeted with integration policies and who are left out? In which domains of society (e. g. education, labor market and families) is <b>integration</b> expected <b>to</b> take place and at what speed? What is the desired outcome of integration, both for immigrants and for members of the receiving society? How is this outcome measured and best achieved? The articles included in this publication show that there is no single <b>pathway</b> <b>to</b> successful immigrant <b>integration.</b> Immigrants – just like anyone else – have multiple roles in their lives (for example, as family members, workers, students, and political and cultural actors), engage in activities in different social fields, and form relationships along these dimensions, different factors can create obstacles or opportunities for immigrants' integration process. As scholars examine these multiple <b>pathways</b> <b>to</b> immigrant <b>integration,</b> it is important to keep in mind the power relationships embedded in the integration process. Ideally, integration is a two-way process which results in changes in both immigrant communities and the receiving society. The publication shows how crucial it is <b>to</b> examine <b>integration</b> as a process, and study it both at the group and individual level. </p...|$|R

40|$|Normalisation {{as defined}} by Wolfensberger informs British {{services}} for people with learning disabilities, probably without exception. It is an approach which instructs services to help service users acquire behaviours and characteristics which are as 'culturally normative as possible' (1972 : 28). The later interpretation by O'Brien (e. g. 1980), where he summarises and translates normalisation into the Five Service Accomplishments, has attempted to aid support staff in the task of translating operational policies built upon normalisation principles into practice. While many studies have attempted to assess the efficacy of this approach, {{it is difficult to}} establish their success, as their measurement criteria are usually based upon levels of competence and participation - values themselves derived from the normalisation approach. This study attempts to step outside this dilemma by using a comparative research method. Services in London are compared with services in Milan, Northern Italy, as while the latter also undertake to support people with learning disabilities using individual planning processes and on rare occasions residential services, the operational policies, training and overall framework for doing so are underpinned by a holistic, legislative model which views the family or its substitution as the key to service provision. Milanese services also advocate a framework which values interdependence between service users, and indeed considers the group living perspective of living in the community as essential for the development of self esteem. This is felt to be a pre-requisite for effective integration with the local community. British services, conversely, aim to encourage relationships between people with learning disabilities and non-disabled others as the most appropriate <b>pathway</b> <b>to</b> <b>integration.</b> This then acts as a valuable contrast with normalisation and enables the impact of Wolfensberger's approach to be considered in a unique way. The comparison is on three levels. Residential services - one in London and one in Milan - are studied using in-depth interviews with a total of 12 service users and 11 staff, as well as participant observation of daily life in each project. Individual planning processes, seen as the most direct way by which service ideology is implemented, is compared by interviewing 21 service users and their key-workers and 5 relatives, and sitting in on individual planning meetings. Staff training structures are also compared. In addition, operational policies for the residential services and the planning services, as well as relevant legislation from each country, is analysed in depth. The findings are discussed at each stage and comparisons made. Recommendations related to interpreting service principles are made for increasing good practice in certain aspects of the British services. The main suggestion is that consistent, legislated training for support staff in British services might contribute towards ameliorating current difficulties described by much of the contemporary research. The observation that the implementation of normalisation is by way of an approach rather than a model of service provision is highlighted...|$|R
40|$|When {{analysing}} {{complex interaction}} networks occurring in biological cells, a biologist needs computational support {{in order to}} understand the effects of signalling molecules (e. g. growth factors, drugs). ANIMO (Analysis of Networks with Interactive MOdelling) is a tool that allows the user to create and explore executable models of biological networks, helping to derive hypotheses and to plan wet-lab experiments.

This detailed description implements our best computational practices and most elaborate parameterization steps, as defined from over a decade of technical evolution. Pathway recruitment curves and strength-duration relationships highlight the non-linear response of axons to changes in the DBS parameter settings.

This change is inclusive of learning thoughts, experiences and patterns of behavior of the native population {{on the part of}} the refugees. The periods of transformation constituting this change present varying processes and dynamics. It is against this background that the researcher found it necessary to explore the processes and dynamics <b>to</b> culture <b>integration</b> into the Swedish Society. Focus was put on the Somali refugee community within Gothenburg city. In this manner constituent parts of the <b>pathway</b> <b>to</b> refugee <b>integration</b> specific <b>to</b> the Somali community were unearthed. This was a qualitative study, the researcher used a descriptive multiple case study research design. The design was descriptive in nature so as to enable the exploration of the culture integration process and associated dynamics and thus questions relating to how and what constitutes this process were answered. The design also took multiple case approach so as to explore the difference within and between cases. The research subjects were first generation refugees from Somalia who had lived in Sweden for at least five years. Semi structured interviews were held with the research subjects and these were processed and analyzed through qualitative means of coding and thematic development. The respondents described the Swedish culture as one that was wholly different from their own. From the study results, the breakthrough to learning the Swedish culture was associated with learning the Swedish language. It was reported that learning the language facilitates interaction with the native population which further enables the learning and acceptance of other elements of the culture. The respondents reported various aspects of the Swedish culture that they do relate to; consequently those that they do not relate to were reported. This information represented the period of transformation within the respondents life highlighting aspects of culture adaptation and culture shedding. A continuum of experiences were shared with regard <b>to</b> culture <b>integration</b> processes, concerns were raised on the structuring of the Swedish for Immigrants (SFI) program, issues of residential segregation were aired out, and also the negative construction of Somali people was raised. With regard to culture position of the respondents, positive and negative concerns were raised with regard to membership and acceptance within the Swedish society. On positive note the respondents had received Swedish citizenship, had reunified with family, had social relationships with the natives and also could practice the Muslim faith. On the contrary refugee acceptance and membership to society was in doubt because of the discriminatory tendencies, hardship in using own language and non acceptance of Somali dress codes thus concerns of mutual accommodation were raised...|$|R
40|$|In Australia, {{representation}} of Indigenous populations within the engineering profession is very low. Evidence suggests that {{understanding of the}} needs, values and priorities of Indigenous communities is low among engineers. It {{has been suggested that}} the continuing low levels of participation of Australian Indigenous people in the engineering profession may stem from negative interactions between Indigenous traditional owner groups and the engineering industry. There also continues to be a low level of awareness of the differences between knowledge systems in Indigenous and Western cultures. Progressing the Indigenous inclusion agenda within Australian Engineering Education requires a clearer understanding of the current status of efforts in this area, and in particular, the preparedness of engineering educators to manage increased numbers of students from this non-traditional cohort effectively. This paper reports on a proposed <b>pathway</b> <b>to</b> effective <b>integration</b> of Aboriginal perspectives (including knowledge and value systems) in engineering education. Interview research was conducted to explore engineering educators 2 ̆ 7 understandings of Australian Indigenous cultures, and their views on incorporating Indigenous perspectives. Ten engineering academics from around the country were interviewed on their experiences working with Indigenous people in professional, social and educational settings. The findings of this study point towards a historical disconnect between non-Indigenous and Indigenous Australians. Awareness of Indigenous cultures and history appears to be limited, although there is a level of good-will towards changing this. Of critical importance was the lack of long-term professional and/or personal relationships between the engineering educators in this study and Indigenous Australians. This presents challenges moving forward as fundamental understandings of culture, history and politics are limited. Connections between Indigenous communities and engineering schools and academics are basic at best, and at the individual level. The low {{representation of}} Indigenous people within engineering academia and Industry means that a concerted effort must be made to bridge the divide.

This work includes (a) the design and development of a prototype of a cognitive tool intended to support the design of language learning experiences; (b) an article that advocates project-based learning (PBL) as a powerful instructional device to support sophisticated learning experiences in WLTE; and (c) the exploration of conceptual and interactual aspects of said cognitive tool. Chapter 2, 2 ̆ 2 Project-based learning: A promising <b>pathway</b> <b>to</b> technology <b>integration</b> in world language teacher education 2 ̆ 2 proposes a taxonomy of complex WLTE tasks. This article discusses how some of the possibilities that PBL offers can be operationalized in WLTE and argues that providing preservice language teachers experiences with and exposure to sophisticated pedagogical interventions, such as the ones supported by PBL, can improve the integration of technology into the design of language learning activities. As this article shows, PBL is suitable {{to take full advantage of}} the complexity of WLTE to immerse preservice teachers in rich design experiences that integrate technology. However, implementing PBL in WLTE poses many challenges. Technology tools that facilitate the conceptualization, creation and management of projects may help in the implementation of PBL in WLTE.

40|$|The {{past three}} decades have seen {{increasing}} interest in the integration of Muslims as the most visible ethno-religious minority group in Britain. Previous research reported that Muslims in northern parts of England, for instance, had developed separate rather than integrated lives (Cantle 2001 : 9). Though more recent surveys have reported an emerging change in such trends (Simpson 2012), Muslims in the Scottish context established a more mixed and integrated way of living with the majority from the outset, (Hussain and Miller 2006 : 19) which was associated partly with the smaller population of Muslims in Scotland (Penrose and Howard 2008 : 95). This qualitative research looks at the different identity negotiation and integration strategies of Muslims, and introduces the idea of ‘Halal integration’ which entails fitting into society while maintaining religious identity. This refers {{to the life of}} many Scottish Muslims, Halal Scots, who integrated into many aspects of Scottish society whilst maintaining their religious identity and practices. One example of such integration was the construction of hybrid or multiple social identities that constitute both Scottish and Muslim identity (Saeed et. al. 1999 : 836; Hussain and Miller 2006 : 150; Hopkins 2008 : 121). Other examples were adopting alternative ways of socialising such as meeting at cafés, running family and social events in non-alcoholic environments, and taking part in voluntary and charitable work. This study, thus, explains important barriers and <b>pathways</b> <b>to</b> Muslims’ <b>integration</b> in Scotland. The research involved 43 semi-structured interviews with Muslims who were differentiated by generation and gender. Most existing studies of Muslims in Scotland have focused on major urban areas such as Edinburgh and Glasgow (Hopkins 2004; Hussain and Miller 2006; Virdee et. al. 2006; Kyriakides et. al. 2009). My study will therefore extend such research by comparing the experiences of Muslims across Scottish major cities and small towns. It will thus deepen our understanding of Muslims in Scotland. This thesis suggests that even though religion {{played an important role in}} their integration and identity negotiation, other factors such as nationality, ethnicity, racism and Islamophobia also played a significant part. It also suggests an emerging shift in the second generation Muslims’ economic, educational and social integration into Scottish society...|$|R

However, for teachers it is not always clear at what age children can be taught which aspects of first aid. In addition, {{it is not clear what}} constitutes “performing first aid” and we strongly advocate that the first aid curriculum is broader than CPR training alone. ObjectivesTo develop an evidence-based educational <b>pathway</b> <b>to</b> enable the <b>integration</b> of first aid into the school curriculum by defining the goals to be achieved for knowledge, skills and attitudes, for different age groups. MethodsStudies were identified through electronic databases research (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase). We included studies on first aid education for children and adolescents up to 18 years old. A multidisciplinary expert panel formulated their practice experience and expert opinion and discussed the available evidence. ResultsWe identified 5822 references and finally retained 30 studies (13 experimental and 17 observational studies), including studies concerning emergency call (7 studies), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (18 studies), AED (Automated External Defibrillator) use (6 studies), recovery position (5 studies), choking (2 studies), injuries (5 studies), and poisoning (2 studies). Recommendations (educational goals) were derived after carefully discussing the currently available evidence in the literature and balancing the skills and attitudes of children of different ages. ConclusionsAn evidence-based educational pathway with educational goals concerning learning first aid for each age group was developed. This educational pathway can be used for the integration of first aid training in school curricula...|$|R
40|$|Inappropriate biomechanics, namely wear-and-tear, {{has been}} long {{believed}} to be a main cause of osteoarthritis (OA). However, this view is now being re-evaluated, especially when examined alongside mechanobiology and new biomechanical studies. These are multiscale experimental and computational studies focussing on cell- and tissue-level mechanobiology through to organ- and whole-body-level biomechanics, which focuses on the biomechanical and biochemical environment of the joint tissues. This review examined papers from April 2015 to April 2016, with a focus on multiscale experimental and computational biomechanical studies of OA. Assessing the onset or progression of OA at organ- and whole-body-levels, gait analysis, medical imaging and neuromusculoskeletal modelling revealed the extent to which tissue damage changes the view of inappropriate biomechanics. Traditional gait analyses studies reported that conservative treatments can alter joint biomechanics, thereby improving pain and function experienced by those with OA. Results of animal models of OA were consistent with these human studies, showing interactions among bone, cartilage and meniscus biomechanics and the onset and/or progression OA. Going down size scales, experimental and computational studies probed the nanosize biomechanics of molecules, cells and extracellular matrix, and demonstrated how the interactions between biomechanics and morphology affect cartilage dynamic poroelastic behaviour and <b>pathways</b> <b>to</b> OA. Finally, <b>integration</b> of multiscale experimental data and computational models were proposed to predict cartilage extracellular matrix remodelling and the development of OA.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the use of a}} continuous, linear grading scheme for compositionally-graded metamorphic InxGal-As buffers on GaAs, which can be used as virtual substrates for optical emitters operating at wavelengths > 1. 2 gm. Such virtual substrates will allow access to new materials {{that can be used for}} designing optical and electronic devices with superior characteristics and performances compared with conventional devices that are grown lattice-matched on standard substrates such as GaAs and InP. In addition, the principles behind such graded buffers can be used to bridge different lattice-constants, which can be a <b>pathway</b> <b>to</b> future <b>integration</b> of previously distinct classes of devices that have been defined by the lattice-constant on which they were built (e. g. Si-based, GaAs-based, InP-based etc.). Graded buffers with threading dislocation densities (TDD) < 9. 5 x 104 cm- 2, at a final composition of x = 0. 346 were obtained, representing the lowest value ever achieved at or around this composition. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out on InGaAs quantum wells (QWs) that were re-grown on these buffers, and high luminescence efficiency was observed in the 1. 2 - 1. 5 tm wavelength range. Ridge waveguide QW-separate confinement heterostructure lasers and heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) were also grown on the graded buffers to demonstrate their applicability for device applications. Pulsed threshold current densities of 262 Ac 2 at room temperature were obtained for 2 mm long strained-InGaAs QW emitting at 1320 nm, with peak output powers up to 40 mW. Preliminary tests on the unoptimized HBTs revealed that they operate with dc current gains of up to 13. A new class of graded buffers using all-binary III-V semiconductors has also been demonstrated. Thin constituent layers of GaAs and InP are combined such that they act in a mechanically-similar fashion as a random alloy. (cont.) We term this combination of many thin layers of constituent materials a Digital Metamorphic Alloy (DMA). The DMAs are used to replace conventional random-alloys in a metamorphic buffer layer. Such a DMA buffer has superior thermal conductivities to, and avoids materials growth-related problems associated with, conventional compositionally-graded random-alloy metamorphic buffers. The method of fabricating DMAs is described. Lattice-constant grading from GaAs to InP has been carried out using both the DMA concept, and a hybrid random-alloy-buffer/DMA approach. by Kenneth Eng Kian Lee. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Within the EU, {{efforts in}} {{relation}} <b>to</b> <b>integration</b> are generally directed towards migrants {{from outside the}} EU. However, {{there is evidence that}} intra-EU migrants face similar obstacles <b>to</b> <b>integration</b> <b>to</b> those of non-EU citizens. Since Ireland has a large EU migrant population, this paper critically explores EU migrants’ integration in Ireland. Drawing on a wider longitudinal study, the paper focuses on the lived experiences of 39 migrants from EU Member States living in Ireland. Focusing on domains of integration, we explore the different pathways by which EU migrants move to Ireland and become part of Irish society. Cultural and social pathways – including language, study, adventure and social relationships – are important as the original motivation for migration. Contrary to popular perception, economic factors such as employment were mostly seen as enabling social and cultural interests. However, economic but also social <b>pathways</b> came <b>to</b> the fore during the recession, when securing one’s livelihood and networks took on a new importance. We show that migrants developed various tactics to intensify their contact with Irish society and to develop feelings of being ‘at home’, despite a deteriorating economic situation. Despite these individual efforts, EU migrants continue to face obstacles <b>to</b> <b>integration</b> in Ireland: obstacles that need to be acknowledged at addressed within Ireland and across the EU more broadly...|$|R
