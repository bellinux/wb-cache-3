25|$|An {{accident}} at sea in late 1798 forced Apollo back to port in Great Yarmouth {{and left her}} with a depleted crew. A capstan pawl, or crossbar, had broken while the crew were raising the anchor, {{and the weight of}} the anchor and chain caused the remaining <b>pawls</b> to turn sharply as the anchor ran back out. Around thirty men were injured after being struck by the <b>pawls.</b> Halkett gave orders for a prompt return to port, where the injured men were discharged from Apollos service and entrusted to local medical care. The ship then put back to sea on 5 January, without replacing the injured crew.|$|E
25|$|Splitter: A {{splitter}} or {{riving knife}} is a vertical projection located behind the saw blade. This {{can be a}} pin or a fin. It is slightly narrower in width than the blade and located directly {{in line with the}} blade. The splitter prevents the material being cut from being rotated thereby helping to prevent kickback. Splitters may incorporate <b>pawls,</b> a mechanism with teeth designed to bite into wood and preventing kickback. Splitters can take many forms, including being part of the blade guard that comes standard with the saw. Another type of splitter is simply a vertical pin or fin attached to an insert. Splitters are available commercially or can be made from wood, metal or plastic.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 April 1948 {{a serious}} {{accident}} {{took place at}} the Waterloo Armstrong Lift; coal was still taken down to the original generating station which powered station offices at Waterloo. A shunt of wagons was being propelled on to the lift at the upper level; four <b>pawls</b> were supposed to be engaged to provide partial support to the lift table, but it appears that some had not engaged. The table tilted, drawing the wagons and M7 locomotive number 672 on to the table; the table and the entire shunt including the locomotive fell down the shaft. The locomotive and wagons were cut up in situ. [...] There is no information as to the fate of the locomotive driver.|$|E

50|$|The parking <b>pawl</b> {{locks the}} {{transmission}}'s output shaft to the transmission casing by engaging a <b>pawl</b> (a pin) that engages in a notched wheel on the shaft, stopping it (and thus the driven wheels) from rotating. The main {{components of a}} parking <b>pawl</b> mechanism are the parking gear, parking <b>pawl,</b> actuator rod, cam collar, cam plate, pivot pin and parking <b>pawl</b> return spring. The mechanism assembly is designed so that the parking <b>pawl</b> tooth collides and overrides the parking gear teeth (ratchets) until a safe engagement speed for the vehicle is reached. Software controls are {{put in place to}} avoid this condition and engage the <b>pawl</b> only when the vehicle has come to a stand still.|$|R
2500|$|Each dot is {{produced}} by a tiny metal rod, also called a [...] "wire" [...] or [...] "pin", which is driven forward by [...] {{the power of a}} tiny electromagnet or solenoid, either directly or through small levers (<b>pawls).</b> Facing the ribbon and the paper is a small guide plate (often made of an artificial jewel such as sapphire or ruby [...] ) pierced with holes to serve as guides for the pins. The moving portion of the printer is called the print head, and when running the printer as a generic text device generally prints one line of text at a time. Most dot matrix printers have a single vertical line of dot-making equipment on their print heads; others have a few interleaved rows in order to improve dot density.|$|E
2500|$|The Baitcasting reel or revolving-spool reel, {{like the}} {{conventional}} reel, is a multiplying reel – {{that is to}} say that the line is stored on a bearing-supported revolving spool that is geared so that a single revolution of the crank handle results in multiple revolutions of the spool. [...] The bait casting reel is mounted above the rod, hence its other name given to it in New Zealand and Australia, the overhead reel. [...] The baitcasting reel dates from at least the mid-17th century, but came into wide use by amateur anglers during the 1870s. [...] Early bait casting reels were often constructed with brass or iron gears, with casings and spools made of brass, German silver, or hard rubber. [...] Featuring multiplying gears ranging from 2:1 to 4:1, these early reels had no drag mechanism, and anglers used their thumb on the spool to provide resistance to runs by a fish. [...] As early as the 1870s, some models used bearings to mount the spool; as the free-spinning spool tended to cause backlash with strong pulls on the line, manufacturers soon incorporated a clicking pawl mechanism. [...] This 'clicker' mechanism was never intended as a drag, but used solely to keep the spool from overrunning, much like a fly reel. [...] Baitcasting reel users soon discovered that the clicking noise of the <b>pawls</b> provided valuable warning that a fish had taken the live bait, allowing the rod and reel to be left in a rod holder while awaiting a strike by a fish.|$|E
2500|$|The Advance {{in ballast}} got {{underway}} for Port Stephens at about 7 o’clock yesterday (Monday) morning, from the Government wharf, Botany Bay {{there was a}} light breeze from the SE at the time, but the weather was overcast, and the wind gradually freshened till, about three quarters of an hour afterwards, it was blowing a strong gale. We attempted to beat out, and made one board across from {{the south side of the}} bay, near Captain Cook's monument towards La Perouse As we proceeded it was thought that she would be able to get right out, but when nearing La Perouse the wind headed us [...] veering more to the eastward, and we had to go around in an attempting, to do so the vessel missed stays. We filled on her, as there was no room to wear we made another attempt to stay her She would not stay, however, and the anchor was accordingly let go, which brought her up A kedge was then run out to try and heave her off and when we got to work the vessel was gradually being dragged off when the line unfortunately gave way. All this time the schooner was hanging by the anchor, with her stern just clear of the rocks, and the surf was beginning to break in heavily. Just after the kedge line parted, the <b>pawls</b> of the windlass gave way, and then, nothing holding her she headed right round for the rocks, upon which she was dashed very shortly afterwards We had just enough time to snatch up some of our clothes, get into the boat, which was alongside and pull away. We pulled out Into the bay, and the schooner Harold bound from Wollongong to the waterworks with a cargo of coal coming up at the time we got on board of her and were all landed safely at the Waterworks, whence we came on to Sydney ...|$|E

2500|$|The American-style cabinet saws {{generally}} {{follow the}} model of the Delta Unisaw, a design that has evolved since 1939. Saws of this general type are made in the USA, Canada, Taiwan, and China. These saws are characterized by a cast iron top on a full-length steel base, square in section, with radiused corners. Two 3/8" [...] deep by 3/4" [...] wide miter slots are located parallel to the blade, one {{to the left of the}} blade and one to the right. The most common type of rip fence mounted to this type of saw is characterized by the standard model made by Biesemeyer (now a subsidiary of Delta). It has a sturdy, steel T-type fence mounted to a steel rail at the front of the saw. It has replaceable laminate faces. American cabinet saws are normally designed to accept a [...] " [...] wide stacked dado blade in addition to a standard saw blade. The most common size of blade is 10" [...] in diameter with a blade arbor diameter of [...] ", but 12" [...] or 14" [...] in diameter with a blade arbor diameter of 1" [...] are found in commercial/industrial sites. American saws normally include an anti-kickback device that incorporates a splitter, toothed anti-kickback <b>pawls</b> and a clear plastic blade cover. American style saws have an easily replaceable insert around the blade in the table top. This allows the use of zero-clearance inserts, which greatly reduce tear out on the bottom of the workpiece. It is common for this type of saw to be equipped with a table extension that increases ripping capacity for sheet goods to 50". The saw blade can tilt to either the left side or right side of the saw, depending on {{the model of}} saw. The original Delta Unisaw and early cabinet saws based on it were all right-tilt units while newer Delta Unisaws and many competitive cabinet saws made after 2000 are left-tilt saws. The switch to left-tilt design is due to a lower perceived propensity for the cut piece to become trapped between the rip fence and blade and kick back when the blade tilts away from the rip fence (left tilt saw) versus towards the rip fence (right tilt saw.) While conceptually simple in design, these saws are highly evolved and are capable of efficient, high volume, precision work.|$|E

60|$|The wind freshened and {{progress}} was slower, but the heat {{did not get}} less. Kit's head swam, his arms were cramped, and the backward swing with the oar badly hurt his side. To heave at the windlass levers was worse, {{and he did not}} bother about the sail. Time was going and he thought he felt Cayman's keel touch bottom. Perhaps the sand was uneven and she had crossed a hummock. He laboured mechanically, seeing nothing but the lever he pulled up and down. All the same, he knew the kedge warp came in, because the <b>pawls</b> clinked; if they stopped, the men were beaten, and Cayman would soon strike. Kit did not know the depth of water the patron got, but the sea was smoother, and this indicated that the tide had sunk behind the shoals. In fact, Kit thought he saw shining sand in the foam. All must brace up for a last effort.|$|E
50|$|Most bicycle freewheels use an {{internally}} step-toothed drum {{with two}} or more spring-loaded, hardened steel <b>pawls</b> to transmit the load.

50|$|If the hub has no {{freewheel}} mechanism {{built into}} it, then a front freewheel is required, which screws onto the crank. These were initially taken from BMX or singlespeed/utility bikes {{and use the}} same threads as screw-on rear hubs. It was found that most BMX freewheels weren't strong enough for trials use {{and for this reason}} trials specific freewheels were designed. Trials freewheels are available with up to 120 clicks per revolution to give excellent drive pickup. Since the torque capacity of the freewheel must be extremely high (Fitted to the crank the freewheel will see the highest torques in the bike drivetrain), instead of making a ratchet with 120 teeth and small ratchet <b>pawls</b> to engage them, the ratchet ring has 40 deep teeth which are less prone to chipping or rounding. These are engaged by 3 ratchet <b>pawls</b> at a time, with 9 in total in the freewheel. Each set of 3 <b>pawls</b> is offset by 1/120 of a revolution from the previous set. This is either achieved by using identical <b>pawls</b> with slight offsets in the machining of the seats for the <b>pawls</b> or by having the <b>pawls</b> in each set of 3 <b>pawls</b> shorter or longer than the other sets of 3.|$|E

50|$|As {{reported}} by the local newspaper (as reported in The Colliery Guardian on 15 March 1926.) the six men were finishing work on the second shaft when their portable platform below ground collapsed. The Capstan engine which malfunctioned was powered by a two-cylinder engine; attached to each drum however on the Capstan engine were <b>pawls</b> or ratchets which should have prevented the Capstan engine slipping; and the inspected machinery {{was found to be}} in order; there was no evidence to prove mechanical failure or human aberration. At the coroner's inquest the jury returned a verdict of accidental death. The given verdict had been largely influenced by a special report made regarding this accident by Mr H.M. Hudspeth, H.M. Divisional inspection for the Yorkshire division of mines. The conclusion he personally produced was that the engine driver accidentally put his level into the position for lowering scaffold while the capstan drums were held by the restraining <b>pawls.</b> It was his recommendation that <b>pawls</b> should not be used on worm driven capstan engines.|$|E

When power to the coil disconnects, the spring retracts the <b>pawl.</b> Another <b>pawl</b> pivoted on the frame ensures that the wipers do not move backward; contact friction keeps them in place. Some uniselector designs step on application of the operate pulse; others step on its removal.|$|R
