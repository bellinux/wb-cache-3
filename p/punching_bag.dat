Moe, despite knowing that Tatum is far too strong for a fighter of Homer's ability, promises Sweet that Homer will last three rounds with Tatum.|$|E

500|$|Nixon had Agnew {{deliver a}} series of speeches attacking their {{political}} opponents. In New Orleans on October 19, Agnew blamed liberal elites for condoning violence by demonstrators, [...] "a spirit of national masochism prevails, encouraged by an effete corps of impudent snobs who characterize themselves as intellectuals". The following day, in Jackson, Mississippi, Agnew told a Republican dinner, [...] "for too long the South has been the <b>punching</b> <b>bag</b> for those who characterize themselves as liberal intellectuals... their course is a course that will ultimately weaken and erode the very fiber of America." [...] Agnew, though he denied Republicans had a Southern Strategy, stressed that the administration and Southern whites had much in common, including the disapproval of the elites. Levy argued that such remarks were designed to attract Southern whites to the Republican Party to help secure the re-election of Nixon and Agnew in 1972, and that Agnew's rhetoric [...] "could have served as the blueprint for the culture wars of the next twenty-to-thirty years, including the claim that Democrats were soft on crime, unpatriotic, and favored flag burning rather than flag waving". The attendees at the speeches were enthusiastic, but other Republicans, especially from the cities, complained to the Republican National Committee that Agnew's attacks were overbroad.|$|E
500|$|Garfield {{began taking}} acting classes in Guildford, Surrey, {{when he was}} 9, and {{appeared}} in a youth theatre production of Bugsy Malone. He also joined a small youth theatre workshop group in Epsom and took Theatre Studies at A-level before studying for a further 3 years at a UK conservatoire, the Central School of Speech and Drama. Upon graduating in 2004 he began working primarily in stage acting. In 2004 he won a Manchester Evening News Theatre Award for Best Newcomer for his performance in Kes at Manchester's Royal Exchange Theatre (where he also played Romeo the year after), and won the Outstanding Newcomer Award at the 2006 Evening Standard Theatre Awards. Garfield made his British television debut in 2005 appearing in the Channel 4 teen drama Sugar Rush. In 2007 he garnered public attention when he appeared in the series 3 of the BBC's Doctor Who, in the episodes [...] "Daleks in Manhattan" [...] and [...] "Evolution of the Daleks". Garfield commented that it was [...] "an honour" [...] {{to be a part}} of Doctor Who. In October 2007, he was named one of Varietys [...] "10 Actors to Watch". He made his American film debut in November 2007, playing an American university student in the ensemble drama Lions for Lambs, with co-stars Tom Cruise, Meryl Streep and Robert Redford. [...] "I'm just lucky to be there working on the same project as them, although I don't really expect to be recognised later by audiences," [...] Garfield told Variety in 2007.

500|$|Seldom hesitating to use {{herself as}} the butt of her own jokes, Fey is also well known for {{practicing}} self-deprecating humor, as demonstrated throughout her performance as Liz Lemon in 30 Rock. In an article ranking Fey's six greatest jokes, David Renshaw of The Guardian wrote that the performer's work continues to feature her [...] "trademark mix of snark, self-deprecation and pop-culture smarts." [...] Fey's self-deprecating comedic style inspired Ashley Fetters of The Atlantic to recognize her as comedian Phyllis Diller's successor because of their similar humor. Critics have been divided in their opinions and discussions of Fey's use of self-deprecating humor, {{and its effect on}} women as a female comic; while blogger Kate Harding disapproved of Fey's performance in 30 Rock because [...] "I'm torn between being sad that she apparently doesn't see [...] in herself and being pissed off that she's reinforcing the idea that having brown hair, glasses, and a figure that's maybe a size 2 instead of a 0 actually equals ugly", Jessica G. of Jezebel defended the actress, writing that Fey's performance is [...] "supposed to be parodying precisely the kinds of media that reinforce ideas that unconventional women are unworthy." [...] Writing that Harding misunderstood Fey's intentions, the author concluded that her self-deprecation [...] "is precisely what makes her relatable", elaborating that [...] " [...] have many moments of self-doubt, and seeing someone as successful as Tina Fey be self-deprecating gives us all permission to be imperfect." [...] Sophie Caldecott of Verily defended Fey's modesty and tendency to downplay her own physical appearance: [...] "She mocks her own appearance, sure, but she does so in a way that consistently shows up our culture for placing so much importance on how women look, as if that’s the most interesting thing about us ... Her comic persona on 30 Rock, Liz Lemon, can be laughed at for many things, but her career managerial style and ability is not one of them." [...] Caldecott concluded, [...] "In reality, self-deprecation is an art that comedians everywhere dabble in ... In fact, I defy you to find a good male comedian who isn’t a master of self-deprecation. Comedians make fun of themselves for many reasons, mostly because it is the most readily accessible source of inspiration but also because it is the most generous one." [...] Observing that Fey's material lacks [...] "whining", Gina Barreca of the Hartford Courant wrote that Fey's comedy [...] "is not simply an iteration of self-deprecating femininity passing itself off as humor. In itself, this demarcates the current generation of female humorists from earlier generations of performers who were told, more or less, to use themselves not as a sounding board for ideas but as a <b>punching</b> <b>bag</b> for insults." [...] Fey has also garnered criticism for being politically incorrect, but she defends her right to write borderline jokes, saying that she has chosen to [...] "opt out" [...] of the culture of demanding apologies.|$|E

Need something bad to happen to one of our characters? Just take it out on Regina! Granted, it’s a formula that has served Once Upon A Time in the past, but at this point, it just felt repetitive. That’s why “Only You” and “An Untold Story” provided such a fresh change of pace for a season finale that not only sets up the next phase of the story, but also promises to put Regina in a more central role." ...|$|E
