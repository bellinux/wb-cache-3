The widespread distribution of anoxic sediments deposited synchronously during such a short-lived event indicates that such sediments are not simply the product of coincidental local climatic or basinal water mass characteristics but are the result of a global expansion and intensification of the Cenomanian-Turonian oxygen-minimum zone related to feedback between sea level rise and regional <b>palaeoceanography.</b> The <b>palaeoceanography</b> of the Cenomanian Turonian OAE is discussed in detail in a companion paper by Arthur et al, 1987. -from Author...|$|E

40|$|The latest Cretaceous (Campanian-Maastrichtian) is {{characterized}} by several global cooling and intermittent warming events. These climatic changes influenced the <b>palaeoceanography</b> substantially, including changes of the deep water sources and surface water currents. One {{of the most prominent}} episodes of climatic cooling occurred during the Campanian-Maastrichtian transition. This study focuses on the palaeoclimate and <b>palaeoceanography</b> of the Campanian-Maastrichtian transition by analysing the calcareous nannofossils of DSDP Hole 390 A (139. 92 - 126. 15 mbsf; Blake Nose). For the examination of calcareous nannofossils sixty samples were processed using the settling technique. Biostratigraphical index taxa (Broinsonia parca constricta, Uniplanarius trifidus, and Tranolithus orionatus) suggest a late Campanian age for the major part of the studied section. The calcareous nannofossils are well preserved, highly abundant (6. 80 billion specimens/gram sediment) and diverse (80 species/sample). The assemblages are dominated by Prediscosphaera spp. (20. 5 %), Watznaueria spp. (20. 3 %) and Retecapsa spp. (9. 8 %). Cool water taxa (Ahmuellerella octoradiata, Gartnerago segmentatum, and Kamptnerius magnificus), however, appear less frequently and do not exceed more than 1 %. Due to their rarity these cool water taxa do not support the existence of an intense cooling phase during the Campanian-Maastrichtian transition at DSDP Hole 390 A. Around 133 mbsf several nannofossil taxa, however, show a distinctive turnover. Mesotrophic species like Discorhabdus ignotus, Zeugrhabdotus bicrescenticus and Zygodiscus exmouthiensis are abundant below 133 mbsf, whereas oligotrophic taxa like Watznaueria spp., Eiffellithus spp. and Staurolithites flavus become common above this level.

40|$|Abstract: Scientific {{observations}} of our oceans and climate go back {{no more than}} a couple of hundred years. Most of our information about the evolution of Earth’s ocean-climate system relies instead on proxies – primarily measurements of sediment components that respond to changes in environmental parameters. This paper provides an overview of some of the most important biological and geochemical proxies and outlines their contribution to our understanding of the ocean-climate system. We also discuss some of the challenges that need to be overcome to obtain accurate records. These include: better understanding of the controls on the mechanisms of biomineralization; the impacts of post-depositional dissolution and diagenesis on primary proxy relationships; proxy validation; and analytical considerations. The methods commonly employed in palaeoceano-graphy have their origins in the biological, chemical and physical sciences; <b>palaeoceanography</b> therefore represents a relatively young and truly cross-disciplinary field of research.

This situation is attributed to the view that the Oligocene marks a persistent interval of relative stasis in palaeoclimate and biotic turnover, reflected in deep-sea micropalaeontological communities by conservative body plans, confusing taxonomy and low biostratigraphic resolution. However, in some respects this interval represents the most interesting episode of the Cenozoic palaeoceanographic puzzle because it allows us to unravel the processes that lie behind the transition from a world free of large-scale continental icecaps and rapid eustatic sea-level oscillations to one dominated by these climatic changes.

The subsequent history of the Leeuwin Current comprises climatically-induced changes operating over orbital and sub-orbital temporal scales.

40|$|Diatoms {{from the}} surface sediments and sediments cores in the Skagerrak-Kattegat were {{analyzed}} {{and the results were}} presented in four papers and discussions. The broad aims of this thesis are twofold. The first aim is to correlate diatom data {{from the surface}} sediments to modern sedimentary environments, and try to find out the relationships between environmental variables such as salinity, temperature, currents and water depth, and between diatom assemblages and environmental variables. The second one is to reconstruct palaeoclimate and <b>palaeoceanography</b> of the area since the Late Weichselian. Paper I deals with diatoms in the surface sediments of the Skagerrak-Kattegat and their correlation with the spatial changes of eight environmental variables. The distribution of diatom assemblages reflects the interactions of currents in this area. The results of canonical correspondence analysis show that summer and winter sea surface salinities are the most important environmental variables affecting diatom distribution. Paper II presents the environmental changes of the Late Weichselian in the southern Kattegat. The results show that freshwater diatoms dominate the assemblages throughout the core. Salinities, particularly the sea surface salinity, were much lower than that of today. Sea ice diatoms were main marine species in the assemblages. A climatic amelioration at about 10600 BP was registered. The results presented in papers III and IV show a two-step climatic warming and consequently oceanographic change during the Younger Dryas/Preboreal transition. An abrupt warming in surface water took place at about 10100 BP, which resulted from the inflow of warm Atlantic surface water. Summer sea surface temperature rose about 8 degrees centigrade. This greatly influenced the surface water of the Skagerrak-Kattegat and the shallow areas, but had little effect on the bottom water in the deeper parts. A great difference in temperature along the water column was formed, which resulted in a pronounced stratified water column with warm water at the surface and cold water at the bottom. The warming of bottom water in the deep parts of the region occurred a few hundred years after the first warming when the inflow of warm Atlantic water became stronger and/or the Scandinavian ice sheet had no large influence on the area. A warm period of 7700 - 5100 BP and a climatic deterioration at about 5100 BP were also documented by the changes in current patterns in paper IV.

A suitable MPT record was encountered at Site 1090 in the southeastern South Atlantic, where a 44 -m-thick sequence of Quaternary diatom-bearing foraminiferal muds and oozes was recovered on the Agulhas Ridge. Environmental responses to the MPT comprised changes in terrestrial climate, biological productivity, and regional ocean circulation, as inferred from compositional sediment data and clay mineralogy. A shift towards more arid conditions occurred between 900 and 800 ka in southern Africa. Changes in <b>palaeoceanography</b> already started earlier.

The radiolarites were later detached from their inferred oceanic basement a d accreted within a subduction complex during the Late Cretaceous (Turonian-Maastrichtian) and emplaced over the northern margin of the Tauride-Anatolide continent together with slices of continental margin and ophiolitic lithologies. Following the development of Mesozoic radi-olarian biostratigraphical schemes during the last 25 years, radiolarian biochronology has become invaluable for reconstructing the palaeogeogra-phy, <b>palaeoceanography</b> and tectonic evolution of Tethyan oceanic basins and margins (D...|$|E
40|$|Biotic {{response}} {{to climate change}} The Late Palaeozoic Ice Age (LPIA), spanning approximately from ~ 320 Ma (Serpukhovian, late Mississippian) to 290 Ma (mid-Sakmarian, Early Permian), represents the vegetated Earth’s largest and most long-lasting regime of severe and multiple glaciations, involving processes and patterns probably {{comparable to those of}} the Last Ice Age. Accompanying the LPIA occurred a number of broadly synchronous global environmental and biotic changes. These global changes, as briefly reviewed and summarized in this introductory paper, comprised (but are not limited to) the following: massive continental reorganization in the lead up to the final assembly of Pangea resulting in profound changes in global palaeogeography, <b>palaeoceanography</b> and palaeobiogeogarphy; substantially lowered global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations (pCO 2), coupled with an unprecedented increase in atmospheric oxygen concentrations reaching Earth's all-time high in its last 600 million year history; sharp global temperature and sea-level drops (albeit with considerable spatial and temporal variability throughout the ice age); and apparently a prolonged period of global sluggish macro-evolution with both low extinction and origination rates compared to other times. In the aftermath of the LPIA, the world's climate entered into a transitional climate phase through the late Early to Middle Permian before its transformation into a greenhouse state toward...|$|E

The four extant genera inhabit geographically disjunct river systems and exhibit highly modified morphologies, leading many cetologists to regard {{river dolphins}} as an unnatural group. Numerous arrangements have been proposed for their phylogenetic relationships {{to one another and}} to other odontocete cetaceans. These alternative views strongly affect the biogeographical and evolu- tionary implications raised by the important, although limited, fossil record of river dolphins. We present a hypothesis of river dolphin relationships based on phylogenetic analysis of three mitochondrial genes for 29 cetacean species, concluding that the four genera represent three separate, ancient branches in odontocete evolution. Our molecular phylogeny corresponds well with the first fossil appearances of the primary lineages of modern odontocetes. Integrating relevant events in Tertiary <b>palaeoceanography,</b> we develop a scenario for river dolphin evolution during the globally high sea levels of the Middle Miocene. We suggest that ancestors of the four extant river dolphin lineages colonized the shallow epicontinental seas that inundated the Amazon, Parana, Yangtze and Indo-Gangetic river basins, subsequently remaining in these extensive waterways during their transition to freshwater with the Late Neogene trend of sea-level lowering...|$|E

40|$|To {{reveal the}} palaeoceanographic and palaeoclimatic {{evolution}} {{related to the}} disintegration of the Barents Sea and Fennoscandian ice sheets, high-resolution sediment cores from the continental margin off western Svalbard, western Barents Sea and northern Norway were investigated. The location of these cores is below the axis of the Norwegian Current and beyond, but close to, glaciated continental areas. Hence they should sensitively reflect the <b>palaeoceanography</b> of the northernmost Norwegian Sea. Between, 14. 5 - 19. 5 and 22. 5 - 29 14 C ka, a high abundance of planktonic foraminifera and a small content of subpolar species indicate seasonally ice-free and slightly warmed surface water. This phenomenon is related to the advection of surface water of North Atlantic origin. The onset of the deglaciation is characterized by a marked low oxygen event dated to between 15 and 13 ka, interpreted to reflect a surface water freshening produced by meltwater and reduced oceanic mixing. After the onset of deglaciation, the surface ocean warmed in three rapid steps: (1) around 12. 5 ka, indicated by increased abundances of planktonic foraminifera; (2) at 10. 2 ka and at (3) 10 - 9. 6 ka. The two latter steps are reflected by the increased abundance of subpolar planktonic foraminifera...|$|E
