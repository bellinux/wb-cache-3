40|$|Electron {{transport}} in {{the surface}} oxidized Si nanocrystals ensembles is described based on electrical measurements of thin film transistor structures as functions of temperature and voltage. Contact resistance has been greatly reduced by using a heavily doped silicon-on-insulator layer as electrodes, compared with devices based on Al/SiNCs/Al structures. Traps with the activation energy of 147 and 103 meV have been found when SiNC channels are applied with high gate voltage. The mechanism that these two traps successively dominate the <b>Poole-Frenkel</b> type <b>conduction</b> in low and high drain-source voltage region is discussed based on an assumption that the density of these two traps is different. Trapped carriers' effects on the electric field distribution {{are believed to be}} responsible for the difference of the G-V-ds(1 / 2) Slopes in the different drain-sources regions, which is in accord with the experimental results of the hydrogen annealing treatment.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{a new type}} of threshold switching devices, which is based on a purely electronic phenomena. These threshold switches are polarity independent and switch abruptly from a high resistive state to a low resistive state at a threshold voltage. The device stays in this low resistive state as long as a high voltage drops over the device. When the voltage is reduced, the low resistive state is lost and the device switches back to the initial high resistive state. This makes these threshold switches highly interesting as selector elements for resistive switching memory concepts, based on device arrays, which are the prerequisite for new applications like logic-in-memory concepts. The threshold switching considered here is based on a combination of a <b>Poole–Frenkel</b> <b>conduction</b> mechanism and Joule heating. Hence, it is not strongly restricted to specific materials rather it is connected to the physical quantities of the <b>Poole–Frenkel</b> <b>conduction</b> mechanism and the thermal conductance. This enables to design the threshold switch to its application requirements by adjusting the relevant physical material properties or designing the device geometry.

The as grown films were polycrystalline in nature without {{the evidence of}} any secondary phases. The polarization hysteresis loop confirmed the ferroelectricity, which was also cross-checked with the capacitance-voltage characteristics. The remnant polarization was about 5. 9 muC cm(- 2) at room temperature and the coercive field was 45 kV. There was a slight asymmetry in the hysteresis for different polarities, which {{was thought to be}} due to the work function differences of different electrodes. The dielectric constant was about 452 and was found to exhibit low frequency dispersion that increased with frequency, This was related to the space-charge polarization. The complex impedance was plotted and this exhibited a semicircular trace, and indicated an equivalent parallel R - C circuit within the sample. This was attributed to the grain response. The DC leakage current-voltage plot was consistent with the space-charge limited conduction theory, but showed some deviation, which was explained by assuming a <b>Poole-Frenkel</b> type <b>conduction</b> to be superimposed on to the usual space-charge controlled current.

The microstructural changes due to nitrogen incorporation were examined using electron energy-loss spectroscopy and Raman scattering. The band structure was investigated using spectroscopic ellipsometry data in the range of. 1. 5 - 5 eV, which was fitted to the Tauc Lorentz model parametrization and optical transmittance measurements. The dielectric constant evaluated using optical techniques was compared to that obtained with electrical measurements, assuming a <b>Poole-Frenkel</b> type <b>conduction</b> process based on the best fits to data.

By relating a wide range of measurement techniques, a detailed relationship between the microstructure, and the optical and the electrical structures of a-CN(x) films is obtained. From these measurements, it was found that, primarily, the change in density of the film, with increasing nitrogen pressure, affects the band structure of the amorphous carbon nitride.

To avoid the direct contact of the Gallium-Indium eutectic onto the LB films, which {{is the cause of}} the breakdown of the junction at lower temperatures, a cross electrode junction geometry is used. The problem of poor Langmuir-Blodgett film deposition at the penumbra region of the base electrode is avoided by covering the penumbra region with an insulating #omega#-tricosenoic acid LB film. Using modified Au/LB/Au structures, the current-voltage characteristics have been successfully measured down to 8 K. From the temperature dependence of the current-voltage characteristics, the possible conduction mechanisms of the Au/C_ 1 _ 6 H_ 3 _ 3 Q- 3 CNQ LB film/Au structures have been discussed. At lower voltages at which non-linear symmetric current-voltage characteristics occur, the possible conduction mechanisms are found to be ohmic conduction at V < 0. 05 V and space-charge-limited conduction above this voltage.

40|$|Zirconium {{titanate}} {{thin films}} were deposited on a p-type Si substrate using the pulsed excimer laser ablation technique and the thin films were either highly oriented along (020) or {{were of a}} polycrystalline nature, depending upon the processing conditions. A detailed structural characterization using atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and x-ray diffraction of the highly oriented and polycrystalline $ZrTiO_ 4 $ thin films were carried out. The XPS of highly oriented $ZrTiO_ 4 $ thin films deposited on Si substrates was characterized. The O 1 s spectrum did not show any splitting, indicating there is no possibility of adsorbed oxygens, and the single peak in O 1 s is attributed to the oxygen ions in the lattice. Capacitance–voltage (C–V), conductance–voltage (G–V) and dc leakage current studies were done on both types of thin film. Secondary ion mass spectrometer studies revealed a reasonably sharper interface existing at the thin film/substrate for the polycrystalline films, compared with the highly oriented thin films. A higher dielectric constant and higher leakage current were observed for the highly oriented $ZrTiO_ 4 $ thin films compared with polycrystalline thin films. The C–V and G–V studies were carried in the frequency regime of 1 – 100 kHz on both types of film at higher temperatures (300 – 500 K) {{so as to make}} the minority carriers of the Si substrate respond to the applied ac modulating signal. The activation energies calculated from the Arrhenius plot from C–V and G–V measurements were nearly equal to half of the silicon energy band gap, thereby suggesting a generation–recombination mechanism prevailing in the depletion region of the Si substrate through bulk traps. The interface traps were calculated using the high frequency method and observed to be higher for the polycrystalline films than for the highly oriented thin films.

A downstream plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition reactor with a non-ECR microwave plasma source has been used. While N 2 -SiNx with reasonable electrical properties requires deposition temperatures of about 350 degrees C, the characteristics of He-SiNx even improve at decreasing process temperatures. Almost identical current-voltage characteristics are found for both N 2 -SiNx and He-SiNx prepared at 350 degrees C exhibiting an Ohmic behavior at low fields and a <b>Poole-Frenkel</b> (PF) <b>conduction</b> at high fields.

Aluminium top contacts having a diameter of 0. 04 cm were used both on the willemite films and on a section of the oxide for a comparison of their current-voltage characteristics. A few other electrode metals were also used. The high temperature bake in oxygen used for the formation of the willemite also makes the oxide films more resistive and increases their breakdown strength. With platinum top contacts such films show bulk limited <b>Poole-Frenkel</b> type of <b>conduction,</b> but with aluminium, strong polarity dependence is shown.

Therefore a coating of the microtips with hard diamond-like materials is under investigation. Another approach {{is the development of}} cost-effective, stable, strong, and uniform emitting flat cathode materials, e. g. on the basis of diamond films or carbon nanotubes (CNTs). In this work, the FEE of local, µm-sized spots of dielectric diamond films, nanocrystalline diamond coatings on flat substrates and tip arrays, and CNTs were investigated by means of a field emission scanning microscope (FESM). For these analyses, the FESM was equipped with a new scanning mode, improving the lateral resolution by a factor of 20 to 100 nm. Highly reproducible measurements at different temperatures, for both polarities, and in anode-cathode contact as well as in non-contact were performed on nominally undoped, dielectric and heated (300 °C, 30 min) chemical vapour deposited diamond films of several µm in thickness. FEE occurs over the entire surface of diamond grains on a scale of 100 nm. For vacuum fields between 250 V/µm and 700 V/µm and corresponding local current densities of 0. 5 mA/cm 2 to 500 mA/cm 2, the FEE is limited by the <b>Poole-Frenkel</b> bulk <b>conduction</b> mechanism, i. e. the electron transport occurs by a thermally assisted electron hopping through traps. Neither the injection of electrons at the substrate-diamond interface nor the extraction at the diamond-vacuum interface is limiting the FEE.

Due to their good uniformity with 40 % significantly emitting tips, such arrays are suitable for FED applications. Electrophoretically deposited nanocrystalline diamond on a flat silicon substrate showed an E on of 203 V/µm and local j Max of 150 mA/mm 2. The E on of chemical vapor deposited nanocrystalline diamond in a graphitic matrix was 55 V/µm and j Max was 5 mA/mm 2. Only a small number of spots contributed significantly to the FEE of mm 2 -sized areas of both nanocrystalline coatings, thus providing insufficient uniformity for applications yet. Free-standing carbon nanotubes of 10 - 20 µm in height and of about 40 nm in diameter emitted strongly at E on > 8. 6 V/µm and showed a local j Max of 2 mA/mm 2. Due to their non-uniform length and non-uniform alignment, {{only a small number of}} spots emitted significantly over mm 2 -sized areas.

The electrode gap was 11. 5 mm, and most experiments were conducted with a 2 µm tip radius. Experiments were conducted in cyclohexane to make comparison with previous results with similar experimental setups possible, n-tridecane was chosen based on the known similarities in energy bands for polyethylene and alkanes. Thus n-tridecane {{was used as a}} model system for polyethylene. The additives were chosen based on their electrochemical properties. DMA has a low ionization potential and TCE is a known electron scavenger. Currents recorded below the inception voltage (Pre-inception currents) have been compared to finite element model calculations to obtain high-field conductivity models for liquid and frozen neat n-tridecane and neat cyclohexane. The conductivity models obtained in this way was then compared to classical conductivity models. In addition field dependent ionization and excitation energies obtained from density functional theory (DFT) simulations have been used to explain the high-field conductivity. The high-field conductivity in neat n-tridecane was found to have similar field dependence as what has been reported for cross linked polyethylene, and high-field conduction in cyclohexane {{can be explained by the}} <b>Poole-Frenkel</b> mechanism <b>Conduction</b> currents were observed at lower voltages in n-tridecane than in cyclohexane, corresponding to the low space charge limited field (SCLF) in n-tridecane. This may explain the lower inception voltage in cyclohexane, as the SCLF for cyclohexane is sufficient to make electron avalanches in the liquid phase plausible, while for n-tridecane the SCLF is low enough to limit the field without the creation of a streamer/electrical tree. Thus the formation of electron avalanches in n-tridecane may rely on the formation of a low density region. Adding TCE to n-tridecane increases the pre-inception current and reduces the inception voltage for negative and positive polarity. TCE had no effect on propagation of streamers in n-tridecane. The main effect of DMA in n-tridecane is to enhance the propagation of streamers and electrical trees with positive polarity. This is in line with what has been reported for cyclohexane, and is explained by the low ionization potential of DMA. Inception voltages, light emission and charge injection were found to be similar for liquid and solid phase in neat n-tridecane and in n-tridecane with additives, which indicates that the same processes are responsible for inception and propagation of electrical trees in solids and streamers in liquids when the material is stressed by a fast transient. The similarity between the measured properties in solid and liquid phase leads to the conclusion that electrical treeing mainly takes place in the amorphous regions of the solid phase. The scatter is generally found to increase when going from liquid to solid phase, which is explained by the inhomogeneity in the solid phase. In another part of this thesis work, approximations for the electric field and the charge on a spheroid in a uniform background field (or semispheroid on a plane) and of the maximum extent of the SCLF region on axis of the spheroid is presented. This is relevant for electrical tree initiation, as a SCLF region of about 2 µm is needed for inception. The approximations are accurate for step voltages of finite rise time with exponentially increasing conductivity of the form σ 0 exp(kjEj 1 =n), where "n" can vary from 1 to 3, which covers the range of functional dependence found in the literature, k and σ 0 are constants, and E is the electric field.

40|$|Nanostructured silicon is a {{promising}} materials for research because {{it serves as}} building blocks for nanotechnological applications, such as nano and quantum electronics, sensors and energy applications. However, many of the synthesis methods come with an increased level of sophistication, and thus the unit cost of material produced is high. The study shows that cheap and mass production of silicon nanoparticles can be achieved e ciently with a topdown process of mechanical attrition, particularly using an orbital pulveriser. The inclusion of the powder in a polymeric binder resulted in {{a new class of}} nanocomposite whose electrical properties are promising for devise applications using simple printing processes. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy studies reveal that the powders consist {{of a wide range of}} size and shape distribution, with large faceted particles with sizes between 1 ô 3 m and relatively small particles of sizes 40 ô 100 nm. The variation of the average particle size with milling time ts well with a rst order exponential decay model which was used to evaluate the limiting particle size as about 120 nm. The structural properties of the nanocomposites was investigated using small angle X-ray scattering, while the electrical properties were investigated by conducting I ô V measurements on a metal-nanocomposite-metal structure. Further tests for electronic properties like eld e ect mobilities were achieved by using the nanocomposite as the active layer in an insulated gate eld e ect transistor structure. Electrical characterisation reveals that the carrier injection and transport is determined by two main factors: the concentration of particles constituting the composite, and the level of external bias voltage on the structure. The nanocomposite systems show a clear percolation threshold for charge conduction. Below the percolation threshold, transport is mainly limited by the matrix or insulating binding medium. Direct tunneling and eld emission (FE) are the major transport mechanism for all concentrations at low voltages, while thermally activated processes, such as hopping and thermionic emission are major contributors at low concentrations. At higher concentrations and eld, <b>Poole-Frenkel</b> and Richardson-Schottky <b>conduction</b> mechanisms, resulting from barrier limiting process in the interface, of the metal contact to an interfacial insulator is dominant. Similar pronounced contribution from space charge limited current process resulting from accumulation of charges at the interface, and traps in the bulk, is pronounced at concentrations above the percolation threshold. The transistors function as ambipolar devices, where the dominance of either carrier is deteri mined by the sign and swing direction of the gate potential.

The in-plane current versus voltage (I-V) characteristics were {{dependent on the}} concentration of SWCNTs transferred from the solvents onto the substrates. Solutions with a low SWCNT concentration produced films that exhibited a nonlinear I-V regime. The experimental data fitted with various conduction models indicated that <b>Poole-Frenkel</b> <b>conduction</b> was the dominant mechanism. The temperature dependence of the conductivity also supported this model. Two activation energies were identified-approximately 10 and 20 meV. These {{were thought to be}} associated with the surfactant coatings of the nanotubes.

40|$|The {{innovative}} {{concept of}} engineered barriers {{in the tunnel}} dielectric stack is very promising for low-voltage non-volatile memory applications. In this paper transport in engineered barriers using hafnium oxide (HfO 2) as high-k dielectric is experimentally investigated. The structure was of the type: Al/HfO 2 /SiO 2 /Si. Experiments demonstrate that transport at program and erase voltages is limited by traps in the high-k film. Modelling with <b>Poole-Frenkel</b> <b>conduction</b> quantitatively reproduces experiments, with trap parameters derived from high temperature measurements. Respect to a film of pure SiO 2 with the same EOT, real HfO 2 /SiO 2 barriers exhibit lower leakage at low fields, thanks to the greater physical thickness, {{in spite of a}} much lower conduction at operation voltages. The effectiveness of engineered barriers fatally depends on the electronic features of the high-k dielectric...|$|E
30|$|This paper reports an {{abnormal}} coexistence of different resistive switching behaviors including unipolar (URS), bipolar (BRS), and threshold switching (TRS) in an Al/NiO/indium tin oxide (ITO) structure fabricated by chemical solution deposition. The switching behaviors have been strongly dependent on compliance current (CC) and switching processes. It shows reproducible URS and BRS after electroforming with {{low and high}} CC of 1 and 3  mA, respectively, which is contrary to previous reports. Furthermore, {{in the case of}} high-forming CC, TRS is observed after several switching cycles with a low-switching CC. Analysis of current-voltage relationship demonstrates that <b>Poole-Frenkel</b> <b>conduction</b> controlled by localized traps should be responsible for the resistance switching. The unique behaviors can be dominated by Joule heating filament mechanism in the dual-oxygen reservoir structure composed of Al/NiO interfacial layer and ITO. The tunable switching properties can render it flexible for device applications.|$|E
40|$|Hafnium oxide (HfO 2) is {{replacing}} {{silicon dioxide}} (SiO 2) as the gate dielectric in {{metal oxide semiconductor}} (MOS) structures driven mainly by need to reduce high leakage currents observed in sub- 2 nm SiO 2. The high dielectric constant of HfO 2 (~ 25) compared to SiO 2 (3. 9 bulk) allows a thicker HfO 2 layer {{to be used in}} place of the thinner SiO 2 layer thereby reducing the gate leakage current in MOS devices while maintaining the same capacitive coupling provided by the thinner SiO 2. However, incorporating HfO 2 into MOS devices produces a SiO 2 interfacial layer between the Si substrate and HfO 2 interface. The increased complexity of the multilayer dielectric gate stack and introduction of new materials requires knowledge of the carrier transport mechanisms for accurate modeling and process improvement. A large temperature dependence of the leakage current in HfO 2 gate dielectrics are observed compared to SiO 2, indicating temperature dependent leakage current measurements maybe well suited to understand the transport mechanism of HfO 2 -based gate dielectrics. The leakage currents are measured for two different titanium nitride (TiN) metal gate stacks composed of either 3 nm or 5 nm HfO 2 on 1. 1 nm SiO 2 interfacial layer over temperatures ranging from 6 K to 400 K. For gate biases that yield equivalent electron energy barriers for the 3 nm and 5 nm HfO 2 gate stacks, the 5 nm stack shows orders of magnitude less current and an order of magnitude larger increase in the gate leakage current with respect to temperature from 5. 6 K to 400 K. Knowledge of the energy band structure is crucial in determining what carrier transport mechanisms are plausible in multilayer dielectric stacks. Important parameters, necessary for modeling different transport mechanisms, can be extracted from accurately constructed energy band diagrams such as electric fields and barrier heights. An existing program developed by the author is further modified to incorporate image charge effects, multilayer dielectrics, and transmission coefficient calculations for use in this study. Results indicate that the widely used <b>Poole-Frenkel</b> and Schottky <b>conduction</b> mechanisms for HfO 2 dielectrics can only explain a narrow electric field and temperature range and fail to explain the observed thickness dependence. Modeling the temperature dependence of 3 nm and 5 nm HfO 2 / 1. 1 nm SiO 2 n/pMOSFETs with a combination of a temperature independent term, variable range hopping conduction, and Arrhenius expression (e. g., nearest neighbor hopping) describes the entire measured temperature range (6 K to 400 K). Additionally, HfO 2 defect densities can be extracted using the proposed model and provide densities in the range of ~ 1019 to ~ 1021 cm- 3 eV- 1, which correlate well with defect densities reported in the literature. Defects in the HfO 2 are likely a result of oxygen vacancies...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} electrical characterization {{study of}} aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3) deposited by thermal and plasma-assisted atomic layer depositions (ALDs) {{in a single}} reactor is presented. Capacitance and leakage current measurements show that the Al 2 O 3 deposited by the plasma-assisted ALD shows excellent dielectric properties, such as better interfaces with silicon, lower oxide trap charges, higher tunnel barrier with aluminum electrode, and better dielectric permittivity (k = 8. 8), than the thermal ALD Al 2 O 3. Remarkably, the plasma-assisted ALD Al 2 O 3 films exhibit more negative fixed oxide charge density than the thermal ALD Al 2 O 3 layers. In addition, it is shown that plasma-assisted ALD Al 2 O 3 exhibits negligible trap-assisted (<b>Poole-Frenkel)</b> <b>conduction</b> unlike the thermal ALD Al 2 O 3 films, resulting in higher breakdown electric fields than the thermal ALD prepared films.
