6000|$|... "Now we see," [...] {{continued}} Mary, [...] "that I {{hold my hand}} so as to {{stop the}} <b>pebble</b> <b>stone</b> at the lowest point to which it can go; for I hold it exactly under {{the point where the}} upper end of the string is fastened to the tree. Now I will take my hand away, and then let the pebble fall, and we will see what takes place." ...|$|E
60|$|So saying, Mary {{carefully}} {{took hold}} of the suspended <b>pebble</b> <b>stone,</b> and began to draw it off towards one side. She showed Rollo that, as it was confined by its string above, it must move in a curved line when she drew it away from its place, rising higher and higher the farther it was drawn away. And when she had drawn it out to a considerable distance, to one side, it was at a much higher level, than when it hung down freely in its natural position.|$|E

"Now, {{in order}} to test that," [...] added Mary, [...] "we must take two <b>pebble</b> <b>stones,</b> of {{different}} sizes, and hang them together, by strings of the same kind, and of the same length; and then we must set them a-going exactly together, and then watch the oscillations. You see that as they will be alike in every respect, excepting the size of the <b>pebble</b> <b>stones,</b> whatever difference there is in the mode of vibration will probably be caused by the difference {{in the size of the}} stones." ...|$|R

60|$|Rollo then {{wanted to}} try a very long one, and {{proposed}} that he should climb up into the tree, and tie {{the end of the}} string to a high branch. But Mary was afraid that he would fall; and besides, she said that the pendulum would not swing clear of the branches below. She, however, immediately thought of the chamber window, and said that she would try it there. She accordingly went up into her chamber, taking a large <b>pebble</b> <b>stone</b> with her, and Rollo remained below to set the pendulum in motion, when it should be ready. Mary soon appeared at the window, and Rollo watched her while she tied her pebble {{to the end of a}} thread.|$|E
50|$|Nan'an {{district}} is one {{important part of}} the historical city Chongqing. It was first established in 1929 as an administrative region when the city underwent expansions. At that time, it covers the current Nan Ping (southern plain), Hai Tang Qi (Azalea Creek), Long Men Hao (Grand Water of Dragon Gate), and Dan Zi Shi (<b>Pebble</b> <b>Stone).</b> With series changes to its covering area and naming from the year 1929 through 1950, Nan'an got its current name in October 1955.|$|E
50|$|The Hungary Pavilion had a {{remarkable}} interior ceiling, consisting of about 1000 wooden bars hanging loosely from the ceiling, some 600 among them {{going up and}} down moved by small motors. The pavilion was decorated with natural materials; wood and a <b>pebble</b> <b>stone</b> floor, all surrounded by a water curtain - representing green living in the city. The pavilion's center exhibition item was a Gömböc, a Hungarian invention by two mathematicians. Gomboc is a homogeneous object with the same self-righting feature as roly-poly toy. Gomboc symbolizes the creative and innovative spirit of the Hungarians, and also the philosophical aspect of mankind striving for harmony and balanced life.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a general}} lack of {{research}} concerning the technological aspect of <b>pebble</b> <b>stone</b> artifacts throughout the Northern Plains. As a result, {{little is known about the}} manufacture of these materials except that it is generally accepted that bipolar technology was the predominant manufacturing technique used because of the small size of the pebbles. However, research regarding bipolar technology has also been limited. Furthermore, many researchers have indicated that this technique is crude, poorly controlled, and that it only supplies a marginal product. The research outlined within this thesis examines the manufacture and archaeological significance of <b>pebble</b> <b>stone</b> materials. The ultimate aim of this is to provide some clarification regarding the use of the bipolar method in relation to <b>pebble</b> <b>stone</b> materials. Therefore, the mode of manufacture of <b>pebble</b> <b>stone</b> artifacts will be, in part, accomplished by an examination of experimentally replicated split pebbles using the bipolar technique. As a final point, considering the obvious wide geographic distribution and frequency of use of bipolar technology and <b>pebble</b> <b>stone</b> materials it is unlikely that this technique was thought of so unfavorably by pre-contact groups or that pebble materials were considered marginal or used only when superior quality raw material was not available...|$|E

The maximum bending strength value was about 177 MPa. For the evaluation of their biocompatibility, human osteoblast like MG- 63 cells and osteoclast like Raw 264. 7 cells were cultured on the top surface of the porous t-ZrO 2 bodies. The osteoblast cells were grown with spindle shape, condensed circular growth and three-dimensional network type. In contrast, the osteoclast cells appeared with <b>pebble</b> <b>stone</b> structure...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pebble</b> <b>stone</b> {{installations}} {{are commonly}} found at various Early Bronze Age {{sites in the}} southern Levant. However, their function is often assumed or unknown. Thirteen circular pebble installations were found scattered throughout a residential neighbourhood dating to the Early Bronze Age III at Tell es-Safi/Gath. Five such installations were recently studied by implementing an integrated micro-archaeological approach by which all micro- and macro-artefacts were analysed using various analytical techniques. Based on the analysis of ash-micro remains identified in the sediments, associated plant remains, flint and pottery, we suggest that these installations were used for food-processing, cooking and/or other domestic low-heat tasks. The installations first appear at Tell es-Safi/Gath during the Early Bronze Age III, and seem to disappear during later periods. The functional roles of these installations are discussed in comparison to finds from other Early Bronze Age sites, and of other food preparation traditions known from other periods and cultures...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Pattern {{recognition}} of various phases of normal endometrium and endometrial pathologies during hysteroscopy has many advantages. It {{would help to}} triage women with AUB, {{so as to be}} selective with biopsies and curettages. Recognition of normal variant or benign lesion would reduce burden to the pathologist by decreasing the number of unnecessary sampling. It will also decreases anxiety of the patient as the report/prognostication can be instant in many cases. Material and methods: This prospective, double blind, correlation study was carried out in the teaching hospital with a sample population of 70 women presenting with AUB who underwent hysteroscopy and endometrial sampling. We identified patterns of endometrium which can used to predict six endometrial pathologies which were later correlated with the final histological diagnosis. Results: There was good correlation between hysteroscopic patterns and histopathology report, 33 % of starry sky appearance correlated with atrophic endometrium, 87 % of tongue shaped projections correlated with endometrial polyp, 44. 4 % of <b>pebble</b> <b>stone</b> appearance correlated with myomatous polyp, 50 % of polypoidal pattern correlated with endometrial hyperplasia. 100 % correlation was seen in strawberry appearance, pattern for secretory endometrium and cerebroid appearance which was pattern designated to endometrial carcinoma. Conclusion: Hysteroscopic pattern recognition is a useful concept to triage women who require sampling for histopathological diagnosis.

5000|$|The {{building}} {{stones were}} very carefully chosen. Several quarries were researched. The red sandstone from Weidenthal {{that was used}} for the foundations could not be used for further building as it was riddled with <b>pebble</b> <b>stones</b> and therefore not suitable for statuary work. It was also feared that the red sandstone would get darker through weathering, whereas the whitish-grey sandstone from Vogesen would retain its pale colour. The quarry in Lauterecken could not be used because the strata were too low and it was impossible to cut large slabs. A total of [...] quarry stone and [...] wallstones were delivered.|$|R

60|$|There were a {{great many}} people in the garden besides those who seemed to have come to see the animals. There were groups of children, that seemed to belong in the vicinity, playing in the walks, some jumping ropes, and others {{building}} little houses of gravel stones. There were women seated on benches in various little shady nooks and corners, some sewing, others taking care of babies; while others, at little stands and stalls, sold gingerbread and cakes. At one place Rollo stopped to look at two little children that were playing in the gravel and throwing the little <b>pebble</b> <b>stones</b> about. Their grandmother, who was sitting near, said something to them in French.|$|R
5000|$|In 1959 he {{published}} the first post-war Futurist manifesto Sassintesi (“Stone Syntheses”). In it he advocated {{a new form}} of artistic expression using natural materials - <b>pebbles,</b> <b>stones</b> and rocks formed of various minerals. “The inherent qualities of colour, form, translucence, texture, etc. were to suggest, develop and determine the idea of the artist, while their appearance and positioning produced a harmonious composition that relied much on the stones' natural symbiosis with the cosmos.” [...] His sassintesi were exhibited in Milan in 1961. He tried to revive aeropittura in the late 1960s in a manifesto Orbital Art. His painting Frecco Tricolori (1966) depicts jet fighter planes. He continued to paint, sculpt, teach and lecture throughout the 'sixties, 'seventies and into the 'eighties.|$|R

He also thought he would take all the heavy things out of his pocket, so that he could run the faster, in case he should see any bears. He put them all on a window in the shed. The things were a knife, a piece of chalk, two white <b>pebble</b> <b>stones,</b> and a plummet. When he got them all out, he asked Jonas, who was splitting wood in the shed, if he would not take care of them for him, till he came back.|$|R

His play-things consisted {{of three or four}} smooth <b>pebble</b> <b>stones</b> of different colors, each being of about the size of an egg, which his mother had chosen for him out of the brook, and also of a short piece of bright iron chain. The chain was originally a part of a harness, but the harness had become worn out, and Albert had brought in the chain and given it to the baby. The baby liked these play-things very much indeed,--both the pebbles and the chain. When he was well, and neither hungry nor sleepy, he was never tired of playing with them,--trying to bite them, and jingling them together.|$|R
