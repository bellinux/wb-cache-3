5000|$|Hi-Lo: A {{modified}} version of the classic game of screw the dealer, in which each player has to decide whether the next card is higher or lower than the last. If they guess correctly, the player moves on to the next card. If they guess wrong, the player loses a life and starts over from the beginning. Players may lock, which will save their <b>position,</b> or <b>lock</b> and change, to deal in a card to replace the current card, and then save your <b>position.</b> <b>Locking</b> costs the user a life. The player who ends the game with the most cards locked in wins. If both players reach the end, the player with the most lives wins. This can be best played using a card counter (see #External links). Hi-Lo is Moola's most popular game.|$|R
