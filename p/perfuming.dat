2500|$|The {{traditional}} French preparation involves {{placing a}} sugar cube {{on top of}} a specially designed slotted spoon, and placing the spoon on a glass filled with a measure of absinthe. Iced water is poured or dripped over the sugar cube to mix the water into the absinthe. The final preparation contains 1 part absinthe and 3-5 parts water. As water dilutes the spirit, those components with poor water solubility (mainly those from anise, fennel, and star anise) come out of solution and cloud the drink. The resulting milky opalescence is called the [...] (Fr. opaque or shady, IPA [...] ). The release of these dissolved essences coincides with a <b>perfuming</b> of herbal aromas and flavours that [...] "blossom" [...] or [...] "bloom," [...] and brings out subtleties that are otherwise muted within the neat spirit.

Omm Sety observed that in Lower modern Egypt, [...] "old fashioned people" [...] believed that {{the stars in the}} night sky represented the dead, and notes how in the Pyramid Texts, the Royal deceased were also thought to be stars. The practice in Omm Seti's time of not cutting hair or shaving as a sign of mourning is also echoed in ancient Egypt.|$|E

40|$|How we {{smell is}} {{important}} {{to a lot of}} people, as indicated by the high spending on <b>perfumes.</b> Most <b>perfumes</b> are categorized as feminine or masculine, and this gender categorization is an important factor when people purchase <b>perfumes.</b> This thesis explores odor perception and <b>perfume</b> preference when the person sniffing the <b>perfume</b> does not know the commercial gender categorization. Three psychophysical experiments were conducted, in which the participants scaled the femininity and masculinity of the <b>perfumes,</b> indicated preferences, and gender categorized the <b>perfumes.</b> The <b>perfumes</b> were presented both in glass bottles and when applied on human skin. Results of three experiments indicate that female and male participants (20 – 30 years old) preferred the same <b>perfumes,</b> both for themselves and for their potential partners. The preferred <b>perfumes</b> tended to be “unisex,” that is, perceived as neither strongly feminine nor strongly masculine. The participants did not succeed well in identifying the commercial gender categorizations of the <b>perfumes,</b> and they did not succeed in guessing the gender of the human when the <b>perfumes</b> were applied on human skin. The commercial gender associations of the <b>perfumes</b> only corresponded to how they were perceived in the case of extremely feminine or extremely masculine <b>perfumes.</b> I conclude that the gender categorizations of most <b>perfumes</b> are not related to how they are actually perceived.

60|$|This was a trying case--the father seemed {{incapable}} of giving direction; {{and that the}} threshold of Martindale Castle should be violated by the heretical step of a dissenting clergyman, was matter of horror to its orthodox owner.

I snuffed it off, and, very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea, sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee.

I shut it, and took up another and another, till I had examined all. Catherine's library was select, and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used, though not altogether for a legitimate purpose: scarcely one chapter had escaped, a pen-and-ink commentary--at least the appearance of one--covering every morsel of blank that the printer had left. Some were detached sentences; other parts took the form of a regular diary, scrawled in an unformed, childish hand. At the top of an extra page (quite a treasure, probably, when first lighted on) I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend Joseph,--rudely, yet powerfully sketched. An immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine, and I began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics.|$|E
