5000|$|During World War II, Plasticine {{was used}} by bomb {{disposal}} officer Major John P. Hudson R.E. {{as part of the}} defuzing process for the new German [...] "Type Y" [...] battery-powered bomb fuze. The [...] "Type Y" [...] fuze has an anti-disturbance device that had to be disabled before the fuze could be removed. Plasticine was used to build a dam around the head of the fuze to hold some liquid oxygen. The liquid oxygen cooled the battery down to a temperature at which it would no longer function; with the battery out of commission, the fuze could be removed safely. When an engine is being tuned for higher performance, different pistons and higher lift camshafts are often installed. This creates a risk that the valves might strike the piston, causing serious damage. Valve-to-piston clearance can be measured by placing a piece of Plasticine on top of a piston, replacing the cylinder head, and rotating the engine manually through a full cycle. When the cylinder head is removed, the valves will have made an impression in the Plasticine. The thickness of this impression is measured to give the valve to <b>piston</b> <b>clearance.</b>|$|E

5000|$|For in-line 4's {{there are}} 3 types of crankshaft. No counter weights, fully counter {{weighted}} (FCW) and semi-counter or half-counter weighted (SCW/HCW). Cranks without counter weights ("bent sticks") were used on in-line 4's {{up to the}} mid 1930s for auto-mobiles but are still {{to be found in}} agricultural use with attendant problems. Without counter weights an in-line 4 crank is balanced for primary forces, primary and secondary couples but not for secondary forces. Secondary force out balance can not be balanced on the crank, requiring 2 contra-rotating balance shafts running at twice engine speed. These will only be fitted on premium quality cars that demand very smooth running or on large engines in excess of 2.4L where the level of secondary vibration becomes obtrusive. The primary couples bend the crank to a S shape with the deflection increasing with rpm. Without counter weights this deflection causes fatigue and main bearing failures when the deflection exceeds the bearing clearance resulting in rubs. These failures have resulted in a public perception that high rpm is bad for the engine that lingers to this day. FCW cranks have 2 counter weights on each crank throw. SCW cranks have one counter weight on each crank throw, these are on each end of the crank and both sides of the centre main. The counter weights produce moment couples in the crank that counter the primary couple and pull the crank straighter to enable repeated and sustained high rpm with long fatigue and bearing life. The moment couple is proportional to mass x radius of centre of gravity x distance from pivot, the [...] "pivots" [...] being between 1-2 and 3-4. As they are close to the [...] "pivot", the counter weights adjacent to the pivots on a FCW crank only contribute about 1/4 to 1/3 of the moment. The counter weights balance each other completely for primary forces and couples and have no secondary forces/couple. Counter weights do not affect overall engine balance and vibration. There is no benefit in having FCW crank over SCW. The SCW crank is always lighter and allows more rapid engine and vehicle acceleration but may need a heavier flywheel. FCW cranks are used on engines to save space as the piston has to clear the counter weight at bottom dead centre, SCW although only 25-33% larger to obtain the required couple would make the engine taller and the crankcase wider. For automotive use the switch from SCW to FCW is typically around 1.8-2.2L engine capacity. There are a few [...] "hybrid" [...] cranks (Nissan Z22, LD20), these have large counter weights in the SCW position that are as big as the crankcase and <b>piston</b> <b>clearance</b> permits and small counterweights in the remaining positions to produce the required couple. This gives the lightest crank that the crankcase space permits.|$|E

The control system was developed using LabView and implemented on the PCI 7831. The design goals were fulfilled with some limitations.

The friction of conventional aluminum pistons was also measured for comparison in this study. The measurement of the secondary motion of each piston was carried out to analyse piston friction, and the following findings were obtained. The cast iron piston showed boundary lubrication at compression top dead center (TDC). This is presumably caused by the larger tilting angle of the piston induced by the larger <b>piston</b> <b>clearance.</b> Steel pistons showed hydrodynamic lubrication conditions at TDC and BDC through each cycle, due to a good oil supply...|$|E

40|$|Many common {{industrial}} activities, like energy production, {{people and}} goods transportation, heavily rely on internal combustion engines’ operations. The capabilities {{of reducing the}} total cost of operation and maximizing the uptime of these machines are a very important topic for the their owner and much energy has to be put on the purpose. In many cases, scheduled maintenance programs are adopted. After a defined amount of time, decided by the engine producer, parts are overhauled and updated regardless of the real usage level and damage. Instead, it is clear that being able to substitute only the damaged parts, at due time, will reduce the engine ownership and maintenance costs. While on the market several maintenance tools dedicated to the on-line monitoring of the thermodynamic aspects (mixture characteristics, exhausts analysis, miss-firing) are present, none are available for the evaluation of the kinematics links problems.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the lubrication between a one-ring-piston assembly and a cylinder in an engine. A special apparatus, with a stationary piston and a reciprocating cylinder was used, by means of which the variation of the friction on the piston assembly during the cycle was recorded. The variable factors governing the friction could be independently controlled. Thermocouples were installed at various positions in the piston, the ring and the cylinder, providing a method of determining the mean temperature of the oil between the piston assembly and the cylinder. The tests included an Investigation of the effects of viscosity, speed, and pressure on piston friction force. Results of these tests show that full film lubrication prevails, when the viscosity of the oil is comparatively high. At low viscosities and under pressure, a breakdown of the oil film occurs in the rig at B. D. C. (corresponding to T. D. C. in an actual engine). A theoretical analysis of the lubrication and friction between a piston-ring and a cylinder is proposed for a parallel faced ring. The oil film thickness under the ring is calculated (on the assumption that the <b>piston</b> <b>clearance</b> is empty) and is found to be in the order of. 0003 ", under zero differential pressure conditions. A correlation of this oil film thickness is carried out by heat transfer calculations, which give results of the same order.

40|$|Most {{downsized}} gasoline engines {{currently in}} the market place {{appear to have a}} ‘downsizing factor’ of approximately 30 % to 40 %. However, as concerns regarding fuel efficiency and emission legislations increase, more aggressive downsizing may have to be introduced. This, although can improve fuel efficiency and enhance power density of a gasoline engine further, has some challenges that must be addressed. Large backpressure {{is one of the most}} important aspects that needs to be improved for a highly downsized gasoline engine, especially if a Regulated 2 -stage system is considered. The Divided Exhaust Period (DEP) concept is an alternative gas exchange process, where two exhaust valves from each cylinder separately function, with one valve leading the blow-down pulse into the turbocharger turbine, while the remainder of the exhaust mass flow bypasses the turbine through the other valve. The simulation results suggest that by adopting the DEP concept, the full-load Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) and the stability of the engine were all improved due to the fact that the DEP concept features a better gas exchange process and improved combustion phasing. The part-load BSFC could also be reduced by using the scavenging valve to extend the ‘duration’ of the exhaust valve (thus reducing the re-compression effect) and to achieve internal exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) through reverse flow. However, this depends on the authorities of the scavenging valve timing (and <b>piston</b> <b>clearance)</b> and the combustion stability (EGR tolerance). Driveability issue and poor fuel efficiency in some engine operating regions of a conventional fixed-ratio positive-displacement supercharging system also need to be mitigated. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) driven supercharging solution, with the capability to decouple the supercharger speed from the engine speed, has the potential to provide the full-load BSFC improvement and to enhance the driveability performance, with a minor penalty in part-load BSFC. Both the simulation and experimental results have demonstrated its advantages over its fixed-ratio positive-displacement counterpart. The high-load fuel consumption can be improved by as much as 17. 5 %, and the time-to-torque performance can be improved by up to 37 %. The low-load BSFC was only degraded by up to 2 %, however, given that there was no clutch fitted for the CVT driven supercharging system, a better transient performance is anticipated...|$|E
40|$|The piston-cylinder liner {{interface}} comprises {{more than}} half of the total engine rubbing friction. With current demand being for internal combustion engines with better fuel economy, lower exhaust emissions and higher performance, reducing this form of friction is the subject of much study. The research reported in this thesis is concerned with the development of an existing floating liner rig to measure the friction in this region. The performance features of the modified setup have also been assessed. Parametric studies have been undertaken with the modified setup to identify the potential means of friction reduction. Modifications undertaken in the sealing method and driveline assembly has facilitated friction measurement at higher gas loading of up to 80 barg. The modified sealing assembly with a sealing ring overcame the problem of arbitrary force interruption through irregular liner and seal contacts. Addition of five times higher inertia flywheel aided the motor to support the rig with adequate torque during high gas loading operations. Calibrations have been performed at each different build of piston-liner combination to reduce build to build variability in measurement. Experimental studies have been undertaken to assess the friction characteristics for different factors such as operating pressure, temperature and speed, lubricant oil formulation, piston-liner <b>clearance,</b> <b>piston</b> material etc. Tests have been undertaken at a range of operating conditions; peak pressure of 0 to 80 barg, speed of 1000 to 2000 rpm and average mid-liner temperature of 40 to 90 ˚C. Peak cylinder pressure has been observed to be dominating the friction followed by temperature and speed. Friction spikes were observed near the top dead centre for pressurised operations; where normal load on the rings are highest in a cycle. Higher speed generally results in a higher total frictional loss. However at higher temperature and peak pressure, contrasting effect of speed on total friction has been reported. The study further identified that piston motion play important roles in determining mixed/boundary friction along with the local gas pressure, velocity and oil film temperature. Friction reductions have been obtained by using a lower viscosity oil and higher piston-liner clearance. Maximum friction reduction of 18...|$|R
40|$|This {{project has}} {{documented}} and demonstrated {{the feasibility of}} technologies and operational choices for companies who operate the large installed fleet of integral engine compressors in pipeline service. Continued operations of this fleet is required to meet the projected growth of the U. S. gas market. Applying project results will meet {{the goals of the}} DOE-NETL Natural Gas Infrastructure program to enhance integrity, extend life, improve efficiency, and increase capacity, while managing NOx emissions. These benefits will translate into lower cost, more reliable gas transmission, and options for increasing deliverability from the existing infrastructure on high demand days. The power cylinders on large bore slow-speed integral engine/compressors do not in general combust equally. Variations in cylinder pressure between power cylinders occur cycle-to-cycle. These variations affect both individual cylinder performance and unit average performance. The magnitude of the variations in power cylinder combustion is dependent on a variety of parameters, including air/fuel ratio. Large variations in cylinder performance and peak firing pressure can lead to detonation and misfires, both of which can be damaging to the unit. Reducing the variation in combustion pressure, and moving the high and low performing cylinders closer to the mean is the goal of engine balancing. The benefit of improving the state of the engine ''balance'' is a small reduction in heat rate and a significant reduction in both crankshaft strain and emissions. A new method invented {{during the course of this}} project is combustion pressure ratio (CPR) balancing. This method is more effective than current methods because it naturally accounts for differences in compression pressure, which results from cylinder-to-cylinder differences in the amount of air flowing through the inlet ports and trapped at port closure. It also helps avoid compensation for low compression pressure by the addition of excess fuel to achieve equalizing peak firing pressure, even if some of the compression pressure differences are attributed to differences in cylinder and <b>piston</b> geometry, <b>clearance,</b> and kinematics. The combination of high-pressure fuel injection and turbocharging should produce better mixing of fuel and air in lean mixtures. Test results documented modest improvements in heat rate and efficiency and significant improvements in emissions. The feasibility of a closed-loop control of waste-gate setting, which will maintain an equivalence ratio set point, has been demonstrated. This capability allows more direct tuning to enhance combustion stability, heat rate, or emissions. The project has documented the strong dependence of heat rate on load. The feasibility of directly measuring power and torque using the GMRC Rod Load Monitor (RLM) has been demonstrated. This capability helps to optimize heat rate while avoiding overload. The crankshaft Strain Data Capture Module (SDCM) has shown the sensitivity to changes in operating conditions and how they influence crankshaft bending strain. The results indicate that: balancing reduces the frequency of high-strain excursions, advanced timing directly increases crankshaft dynamic strain, reduced speed directly reduces strain, and high-pressure fuel injection reduces crankshaft strain slightly. The project demonstrated that when the timing is advanced, the heat rate is reduced, and when the timing is retarded, the heat rate is increased. One reason why timing is not advanced as much as it might be is the potential for detonation on hot days. A low-cost knock detector was demonstrated that allowed active control to use timing to allow the heat rate benefit to be realized safely. High flow resistance losses in the pulsation control systems installed on some compressors have been shown to hurt efficiency of both compressor and engine/compressor system. Improved pulsation control systems have the potential to recover almost 10 % of available engine power. Integrity enhancements and reduced component failure probability will enhance aggregate deliverability. In addition to improving the efficiency of fuel conversion, all increases in compressor efficiency will reduce the fraction of available engine power that must go to overcome losses and, thereby, will add to deliverability. Project results confirm an earlier survey of a large range of compressor efficiency. If the bottom half of the efficiency range is upgraded with improved technology, such that the resulting performance approaches the best documented efficiency, the aggregate system-wide capacity could be increased by 10 % with no new installed compression. An additional phase was added to the original scope of work to investigate the perceived imbalance in airflow between power cylinders in two-stroke integral compressor engines...|$|R
