5|$|End of Watch is a 2012 American crime drama film {{written and}} {{directed}} by David Ayer. It stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña as Brian Taylor and Miguel Zavala, two Los Angeles Police Department officers who work in South Los Angeles.

He was also troubled with wanting to leave his manager, Michael Jeffery. Hendrix was fatigued and suffering from poor health, due in part to severe exhaustion caused by overworking, a chronic lack of sleep, and a persistent illness assumed to be influenza-related. Lacking trusting <b>personal</b> <b>relationships,</b> his insecurities about the future and disillusionment with the music industry contributed to his frustration.|$|E

5|$|In many respects, Ranavalona's {{rule was}} a {{continuation}} of precedent established under Radama I. Both monarchs encouraged {{the introduction of new}} technologies and forms of knowledge from abroad, supported the establishment of an industrialized economy, and adopted measures to professionalize the army. Both viewed foreigners with ambivalence, establishing close <b>personal</b> <b>relationships</b> and drawing upon their expertise while enforcing restrictions on their activities to avert destabilizing changes to existing cultural and political systems. In addition, both contributed to the further development of a complex political bureaucracy that enabled the Merina court to govern remote provinces across an island larger than the Netherlands, Belgium and France combined.|$|E
5|$|The book {{begins as}} a chronological {{narrative}} of Suzuki's life with photographs {{of his family and}} friends. The first five chapters cover the same time period as the first autobiography, from childhood to age fifty. Later chapters use a memoir style with personal thoughts developed around themes. Suzuki recounts his experiences with indigenous groups and his <b>personal</b> <b>relationships</b> with individual members. A travelogue of his journeys in Brazil, Papua New Guinea, Australia, and some places in Canada is presented. Scientific concepts and explanations occur throughout the book.|$|E
5|$|The work of George Akerlof and Janet Yellen on {{efficiency}} wages {{based on}} notions of fairness {{provides an example}} of a feminist model of economic actors. In their work, agents are not hyperrational or isolated, but instead act in concert and with fairness, are capable of experiencing jealousy, and are interested in <b>personal</b> <b>relationships.</b> This work is based on empirical sociology and psychology, and suggests that wages can be influenced by fairness considerations rather than purely market forces.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the late}} 20th century, Wollstonecraft's life, which {{encompassed}} several unconventional <b>personal</b> <b>relationships,</b> received {{more attention than}} her writing. After two ill-fated affairs, with Henry Fuseli and Gilbert Imlay (by whom she had a daughter, Fanny Imlay), Wollstonecraft married the philosopher William Godwin, one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement. Wollstonecraft {{died at the age}} of 38, eleven days after giving birth to her second daughter, leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts. This daughter, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, became an accomplished writer herself, as Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein.|$|E
5|$|Each {{successive}} rank {{gave its}} holder greater pensions and legal privileges. The highest rank, of full marquess, {{came with a}} state pension and a territorial fiefdom. Holders of the rank immediately below, that of ordinary marquess, received a pension, but had no territorial rule. Officials who served in government belonged to the wider commoner social class and were ranked just below nobles in social prestige. The highest government officials could be enfeoffed as marquesses. By the Eastern Han period, local elites of unattached scholars, teachers, students, and government officials began to identify themselves {{as members of a}} larger, nationwide gentry class with shared values and a commitment to mainstream scholarship. When the government became noticeably corrupt in mid-to-late Eastern Han, many gentrymen even considered the cultivation of morally grounded <b>personal</b> <b>relationships</b> more important than serving in public office.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Taizong, {{also known}} by his {{personal}} name Li Shimin, {{was familiar with}} the culture of the steppe nomads and employed military strategies using steppe tactics as a prince. Taizong was a skilled horsemen, and during a celebration of his victory and ascension to the throne, sacrificed a horse in a ritual derived from a Turkic religious practice. He was able to outmaneuver the heavy cavalry of the Sui Dynasty with his light cavalry, a characteristic of steppe warfare. Taizong shared <b>personal</b> <b>relationships</b> with Turkic allies as a prince, reinforced through oaths sworn as blood brothers. His later successes as an emperor against the armies of Central Asia through diplomacy and divide and rule are the result of his early experiences with Turkic culture.|$|E

5|$|For {{some days}} Hendrix {{had been in}} poor health, {{due in part to}} fatigue caused by overworking, a chronic lack of sleep, and an illness assumed to be influenza-related. Insecurities about his <b>personal</b> <b>relationships</b> and disillusionment with the music {{industry}} had also contributed to his frustration. Although the details of his final hours and death are disputed, Hendrix spent much of his last day with Monika Dannemann. During the morning of September18, she found him unresponsive in her apartment at the Samarkand Hotel, 22Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill. She called for an ambulance at 11:18a.m., and he was taken to St Mary Abbot's Hospital where an attempt was made to resuscitate him. He was pronounced dead at 12:45p.m.|$|E
5|$|Historians in the 16th and 17th centuries {{focused on}} Edward's {{relationship}} with Gaveston, drawing comparisons between Edward's reign {{and the events}} surrounding {{the relationship of the}} Duc d'Épernon and Henry III of France, and between the Duke of Buckingham and Charles I. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, popular historians such as Charles Dickens and Charles Knight popularised Edward's life with the Victorian public, focusing on the King's relationship with his favourites and, increasingly, alluding to his possible homosexuality. From the 1870s onwards, however, open academic discussion of Edward's sexuality was circumscribed by changing English values. By the start of the 20th century, English schools were being advised by the government to avoid overt discussion of Edward's <b>personal</b> <b>relationships</b> in history lessons. Views on Edward's sexuality have continued to develop over the years.|$|E
5|$|After touring Who's Next, and needing time {{to write}} a follow-up, Townshend insisted that the Who take a lengthy break, as they had not stopped touring since the band started. There was no group {{activity}} until May 1972, when they started working on a proposed new album, Rock Is Dead—Long Live Rock!, but, unhappy with the recordings, abandoned the sessions. Tensions began to emerge as Townshend believed Daltrey just wanted a money-making band and Daltrey thought Townshend's projects were getting pretentious. Moon's behaviour was becoming increasingly destructive and problematic through excessive drinking and drugs use, {{and a desire to}} party and tour. Daltrey performed an audit of the group's finances and discovered that Lambert and Stamp had not kept sufficient records. He believed them to be no longer effective managers, which Townshend and Moon disputed. The painful dissolution of the managerial and <b>personal</b> <b>relationships</b> are recounted in James D. Cooper's 2014 retrospective documentary, Lambert & Stamp. Following a short European tour, the remainder of 1972 was spent working on an orchestral version of Tommy with Lou Reizner.|$|E

5|$|Aspects of Jackson's {{personal}} life, {{including his}} changing appearance, <b>personal</b> <b>relationships,</b> and behavior, generated controversy. In 1993, {{he was accused}} of child sexual abuse, but the civil case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount and no formal charges were brought. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges after the jury found him not guilty on all counts. While preparing for his comeback concert series, This Is It, Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest. The Los Angeles County Coroner ruled his death a homicide, and his personal physician, Conrad Murray, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Jackson's death triggered a global outpouring of grief, and a live broadcast of his public memorial service was viewed around the world. Forbes ranks Jackson the top-earning dead celebrity, with earnings of $825 million in 2016, the highest yearly amount ever recorded by the publication. Jackson is also remembered for his generous philanthropy and his pioneering efforts in charitable fundraising within the entertainment industry. In October 2017, Forbes announced that Jackson had topped the publication's list of top-earning dead celebrities for the fifth straight year with annual earnings of $75 million.|$|E
5|$|During Bure's playing career, much {{speculation}} surrounded Russian NHL {{players and}} their potential ties to the Russian mafia both as victims and associates. As Soviet players began defecting to the NHL, many cases of extortion began surfacing. The Russian mafia was targeting the players' families still living in Russia. Former teammate Alexander Mogilny {{was a victim of}} such an extortion attempt in 1994, while Bure was reported to have made payments totaling in the thousands of dollars to Russian extortionists in 1993. Three years later, in 1996, American sports network ESPN aired reports alleging Bure was a potential associate of the Russian mafia because of his relationship with friend and business partner Anzor Kikalishvili, known to both Russian and American police as a suspected criminal and possible Russian mob boss. Bure was revealed to hold a position as vice president in the sports company Twenty First Century Association, owned by Kikalishvili, and reportedly believed by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to be a mafia front worth at least US$100million in illicit funds. While Bure did not deny his business and <b>personal</b> <b>relationships</b> with Kikalishvili, he refuted reports Kikalishvili was involved in any criminal activity.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Ueshiba {{was invited}} to teach {{at a number of}} {{military}} institutes, due to his close <b>personal</b> <b>relationships</b> with key figures in the military (among them Sadao Araki, the Japanese Minister of War). He accepted an invitation from Admiral Sankichi Takahashi to be the martial arts instructor at the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, and also taught at the Nakano Spy School, although aikido was later judged to be too technical for the students there and karate was adopted instead. He also became a visiting instructor at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy after being challenged by (and defeating) General Makoto Miura, another student of Takeda Sōkaku's Daitō-ryū. Takeda himself met Ueshiba for the last time around 1935, while Ueshiba was teaching at the Osaka headquarters of the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. Frustrated by the appearance of his teacher, who was openly critical of Ueshiba's martial arts and who appeared intent on taking over the classes there, Ueshiba left Osaka during the night, bowing to the residence in which Takeda was staying and thereafter avoiding all contact with him. Between 1940 and 1942 he made several visits to Manchukuo (Japanese occupied Manchuria) where he was the principal martial arts instructor at Kenkoku University. Whilst in Manchuria, he met and defeated the sumo wrestler Tenryū Saburō during a demonstration.|$|E
