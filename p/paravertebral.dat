25|$|The LAP flap is a flap {{from the}} dorsal lumbar area {{extending}} to the lateral {{edge of the}} rectus abdominis muscle which consists of fat, skin and one <b>paravertebral</b> perforator from the lumbar vessels. The lumbar vessels travel through the erector spinae muscles or between the erector spinae muscle and quadratus lumborum muscle. Preoperatively, the perforators are located using a hand held doppler. The vessels are cut {{at the beginning of}} the vasa lumbales.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>paravertebral</b> {{block is}} {{versatile}} {{and can be}} used for various surgeries depending on the vertebral level it is done. A block at the neck in the cervical region is useful for thyroid gland and carotid artery surgery. [...] At the chest and abdomen in the thoracic region, blocks are used for breast, thoracic, and abdominal surgery. [...] A block at the hip in the lumbar region is indicated for hip, knee, and anterior thigh surgeries. The <b>paravertebral</b> block provides unilateral analgesia, but bilateral blocks can be performed for abdominal surgeries. Since it is a unilateral block, it may be chosen over epidurals for patients who can't tolerate the hypotension that follows bilateral sympathectomy. The <b>paravertebral</b> space is located a couple centimeters lateral to the spinous process and is bounded posteriorly by the superior costotransverse ligament and anteriorly by the parietal pleura. [...] Complications include pneumothorax, vascular puncture, hypotension, and pleural puncture.|$|E
2500|$|In later times, {{a set of}} 34 <b>paravertebral</b> {{acupuncture}} points {{was named}} [...] "Hua Tuo Jiaji" [...] (華佗夹脊) in his honour. Hua Tuo is considered a shenyi (神醫, [...] "divine physician") and is worshipped as a medicinal god or immortal in Daoist temples. [...] "Hua Tuo zaishi" [...] (華佗再世; [...] "Hua Tuo reincarnated") is also a term of respect for a highly-skilled physician.|$|E
2500|$|Scoliotic adolescents, at {{the apex}} vertebra, have a higher muscle {{activity}} (as measured by surface electromyography) on the convex side than on the concave side in sitting or standing conditions. Because in scoliotic people wearing a brace, the muscle activity of the erector spinae muscles decreased on the convex side when walking with the brace [...] and because after spinal arthrodesis surgery, idiopathic scoliotic people showed {{a significant decrease in}} <b>paravertebral</b> muscle activity on the convex side but not on the concave side, the muscular asymmetry in idiopathic scoliosis is thought to be a biomechanical consequence of the scoliotic curvature rather than its cause.|$|E
2500|$|Bothrops {{species can}} be {{distinguished}} by their broad, flattened heads which are set {{apart from the rest}} of their bodies. The head of this snake is light to dark brown or even black. Although usually absent, it may have occipital blotches or streaks that range from indistinct to distinct. The underside is most often pale yellow. [...] This species has different patterns and colors on its dorsal and ventral sides and it exhibits a postorbital stripe. The ventral side is yellow, cream, or a whitish gray, with dark blotches that are more frequent closer to the posterior end. Ventrolaterally, B. asper has interchanging gray scales which are more pale towards the medial line. Dark triangles with pale edges can be seen laterally, which range in number from 18 to 25. Apices either alternate or are reflective of each other over the middorsal line. In the interspaces, there are dark, <b>paravertebral</b> blotches. Specimens may have a yellow zig-zag-shaped line {{on each side of the}} body. There is a great variety of colours on its dorsal side: olive, gray, light brown to dark brown, tan or sometimes nearly black. To prevent water loss where they occur in drier regions, this species has more scales.|$|E
50|$|Susisuchus has a dorsal {{shield of}} osteoderms {{that is similar}} to those of the more derived clade Eusuchia, which {{includes}} living crocodilians. Susisuchus was one of the first mesoeucrocodylians to have a tetraserial <b>paravertebral</b> shield, which is formed from the dorsal osteoderms to make the back more rigid. In a tetraserial <b>paravertebral</b> shield, there are four separate rows of <b>paravertebral</b> osteoderms (osteoderms near the midline of the back). Earlier mesoeucrocodylians such as Bernissartia have biserial <b>paravertebral</b> shields, in which there are only two rows of <b>paravertebral</b> osteoderms. These two rows of large osteoderms became segmented into four smaller rows in Susisuchus. Susisuchus also has two rows of accessory osteoderms to either side of the <b>paravertebral</b> osteoderms which are not part of the shield.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cervical}} ganglia are <b>paravertebral</b> ganglia of {{the sympathetic}} nervous system. Preganglionic nerves from the thoracic spinal cord {{enter into the}} cervical ganglions and synapse with its postganglionic fibers or nerves. The cervical ganglion has three <b>paravertebral</b> ganglia: ...|$|E
5000|$|The grey rami communicantes {{exist at}} every level of the spinal cord and are {{responsible}} for carrying postganglionic nerve fibres from the <b>paravertebral</b> ganglia to their destination, and for carrying those preganglionic nerve fibres which enter the <b>paravertebral</b> ganglia but do not synapse.|$|E
50|$|Presynaptic nerves' axons {{terminate}} {{in either}} the <b>paravertebral</b> ganglia or prevertebral ganglia. There are four different ways an axon can take before reaching its terminal. In all cases, the axon enters the <b>paravertebral</b> ganglion {{at the level of}} its originating spinal nerve. After this, it can then either synapse in this ganglion, ascend to a more superior or descend to a more inferior <b>paravertebral</b> ganglion and synapse there, or it can descend to a prevertebral ganglion and synapse there with the postsynaptic cell.|$|E
50|$|The {{segmentation}} of the <b>paravertebral</b> shield {{allowed for}} {{a greater degree of}} lateral flexibility in the trunk of Susisuchus. This flexibility would have enabled lateral undulation while swimming, resulting in greater efficiency in locomotion. Because the width of the <b>paravertebral</b> shield was not compromised by this segmentation, the back would remain rigid enough to overcome the forces encountered during high-walking, or walking semi-erect. However, the ability to high-walk would have restricted the size of Susisuchus. If Susisuchus grew any larger than 50 kg, the forces encountered during high-walking would have been too great for the <b>paravertebral</b> shield to counteract.|$|E
50|$|Along {{the length}} of the {{sympathetic}} trunk are sympathetic ganglia known as <b>paravertebral</b> ganglia.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Paravertebral</b> ganglia (3) of the {{sympathetic}} chain (these run {{on either side}} of the vertebral bodies) ...|$|E
50|$|Prevertebral ganglia (or {{collateral}} ganglia, or preaortic ganglia) are sympathetic ganglia which lie {{between the}} <b>paravertebral</b> ganglia {{and the target}} organ.|$|E
50|$|Two {{thirds of}} the time, the {{sequestration}} {{is located in the}} <b>paravertebral</b> gutter in the posterior segment of the left lower lobe.|$|E
5000|$|Spine (33% of patients): Segmental, usually {{involving}} the thoracic spine. The four main presentations include spondylodiscitis, osteosclerosis, <b>paravertebral</b> ossifications, and sacroiliac joint involvement.|$|E
50|$|Juvenile {{specimens}} {{are usually}} brown with dark brown markings on the head, bronze irises, postocular stripes, <b>paravertebral</b> makings that are edged with yellow, and a tail tip that is yellow or chartreuse. Captive juveniles retain this color pattern {{for about six}} months, after which the ground color starts to become a dull lime green and the yellow edges of the <b>paravertebral</b> vertical bars more prominent. It is thought that the shift to adult coloration takes about 18-24 months to complete.|$|E
50|$|Susisuchus has amphicoelus thoracic, lumbar and caudal (tail) {{vertebrae}}, {{meaning that}} {{the ends of the}} centra of these vertebrae are concave. The presence of this feature in a crocodyliform with a tetraserial <b>paravertebral</b> shield is unusual, and has been used to erect the family Susisuchidae, of which Susisuchus is the only member. Susisuchus can be considered a transitional form because it has a tetraserial <b>paravertebral</b> shield characteristic of eusuchians, but retains more primitive amphicoelus vertebrae characteristic of more basal crocodylomorphs.|$|E

50|$|Stefania ayangannae are yellowish-brown or yellowish-red frogs with {{diagonal}} <b>paravertebral</b> {{dark brown}} marks, often joined to form chevrons in their dorsum. The head has a dark brown patch is present.|$|E
50|$|The spine {{most often}} is {{affected}} by metastatic disease involving the epidural space. This usually occurs as direct tumor spread from a vertebral body (85%) or by invasion of <b>paravertebral</b> masses through a neuroforamin (10-15%).|$|E
50|$|Hugo Sellheim (December 28, 1871, Biblis bei Worms - April 22, 1936, Leipzig) was a {{pioneering}} physician {{in the field}} of gynecology and obstetrics. He is credited with performing the first thoracic <b>paravertebral</b> block, in 1905.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} spot-tailed earless lizard is overall light grayish tan in color, {{with two}} <b>paravertebral</b> rows of transverse light-edged dark blotches, one row down {{either side of}} the back and a second lateral row of dark, pale-edged blotches that are usually not connected to the <b>paravertebral</b> blotches. Adults are 11.5 - 15.4 cm in total length. They have round, dark spots on the ventral surface of the tail, a characteristic which gives them both their common and scientific names. As with all species and subspecies of earless lizard, they have no external ear openings. When gravid, females will often turn greenish yellow on neck and trunk.|$|E
50|$|The white rami communicantes {{exist only}} at the levels of the spinal cord where the intermediolateral cell column is present (T1-L2) and are {{responsible}} for carrying preganglionic nerve fibres from the spinal cord to the <b>paravertebral</b> ganglia.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is formed}} of {{longitudinal}} and transverse fibers that bridge the aponeuroses of internal oblique and transversalis, costal angles and iliac crest laterally, to the vertebral column and sacrum medially. In doing so, they cover the <b>paravertebral</b> muscles.|$|E
50|$|Therapy for notalgia paresthetica is {{directed}} at controlling symptoms, as no cure exists for the condition. Available treatments include local anesthetics, topical capsaicin, topical corticosteroids, hydroxyzine, oxcarbazepine, palmitoylethanolamide and gabapentin. <b>Paravertebral</b> nerve block and botulinum toxin injections may also be helpful.|$|E
5000|$|In 1902 he {{described}} [...] "Grocco's triangle", a triangular area of <b>paravertebral</b> dullness {{on the side}} opposite a pleural effusion. His name is also associated with [...] "Grocco's sign", defined as acute dilatation of the heart following a muscle effort.|$|E
50|$|Nerves {{arising from}} the lateral horn of the spinal cord {{are those of the}} {{autonomic}} nervous system. They exit through the ventral root of the spinal cord, and continue through the ventral rami. At that point, they sharply branch to go through the white ramus communicans of the <b>paravertebral</b> body. Unlike the thoracic and cutaneous nerves, the ANS nerves destined for the pelvic viscera continue through the <b>paravertebral</b> ganglia without synapsing. Instead of synapsing, they continue through splanchnic nerves until they reach a prevertebral ganglia (located proximally to their target organ). Once inside the prevertebral ganglia, the individual neurons comprising the nerve synapse with their postganglionic neuron. The postganglionic nerve then proceed to innervate their targets (pelvic visceral organs).|$|E
50|$|Along {{the length}} of the {{sympathetic}} trunks are ganglia known as ganglia of sympathetic trunk, sympathetic ganglia or <b>paravertebral</b> ganglia. The ganglia are distinguished as cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral and, except in the neck, they closely correspond in number to the vertebrae.|$|E
5000|$|The {{thoracic}} ganglia are <b>paravertebral</b> ganglia. The thoracic {{portion of}} the sympathetic trunk typically has 12 thoracic ganglia. Emerging from the ganglia are thoracic splanchnic nerves (the cardiopulmonary, the greater, lesser, and least splanchnic nerves) that help provide sympathetic innervation to abdominal structures.|$|E
50|$|The {{species has}} a flat head and {{measures}} between 115 and 160 mm in length. Its tail’s tip is either rounded or pointed, {{with or without}} <b>paravertebral</b> glands. Due to its black colour, it {{is similar to the}} other alpine salamander, Salamandra atra atra.|$|E
5000|$|The preganglionic neuron can synapse with a postganglionic {{sympathetic}} neuron in {{the sympathetic}} <b>paravertebral</b> ganglion at that level. From here, the postganglionic sympathetic neuron can travel {{back out the}} grey ramus communicans of that level to the mixed spinal nerve {{and on to the}} effector organ.|$|E
5000|$|The subspecific name, longipunctatus, is a {{combination}} of the Latin words longus meaning [...] "long", punctum meaning [...] "spot", and the suffix -atus meaning [...] "pertaining to", which literally describes the laterally elongated <b>paravertebral</b> spots on the lizard's back which are a diagnostic of the subspecies.|$|E
50|$|Preganglionic {{sympathetic}} fibres {{from the}} intermediolateral nucleus in the lateral grey column of {{the spinal cord}} are carried in the white ramus communicans to the <b>paravertebral</b> ganglia of the sympathetic trunk. Once the preganglionic nerve has traversed a white ramus communicans, it can do one of three things.|$|E
50|$|The {{postsynaptic cell}} {{then goes on}} to {{innervate}} the targeted end effector (i.e. gland, smooth muscle, etc.). Because <b>paravertebral</b> and prevertebral ganglia are relatively close to the spinal cord, presynaptic neurons are generally much shorter than their postsynaptic counterparts, which must extend throughout the body to reach their destinations.|$|E
50|$|The lumbar ganglia are <b>paravertebral</b> ganglia. The lumbar {{portion of}} the {{sympathetic}} trunk typically has 4 lumbar ganglia. The lumbar splanchnic nerves arise from the ganglia here, and contribute sympathetic efferent fibers to the nearby plexuses. The first two lumbar ganglia have both white and gray rami communicantes.|$|E
50|$|The sacral ganglia are <b>paravertebral</b> ganglia of the {{sympathetic}} trunk.:39 As {{the sympathetic}} trunk heads inferiorly down the sacrum, it turns medially. There are generally {{four or five}} sacral ganglia. In addition to gray rami communicantes, the ganglia send off sacral splanchnic nerves to join the inferior hypogastric plexus.|$|E
