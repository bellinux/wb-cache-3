5|$|Although the Poor Law Amendment Act did not ban {{all forms}} of outdoor relief, it stated that no able-bodied person was to receive money or other help from the Poor Law {{authorities}} except in a workhouse. Conditions in workhouses were to be made harsh to discourage people from claiming.

The Poor Law Commissioners were to be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Act.|$|E

5|$|Historically, Aldermaston was a hundred, {{though for}} a period it was within the Theale hundred. By the 19th century, the {{hundreds}} had been superseded by other sub-divisions. From then on, Aldermaston was, at times, part of the Bradfield Poor Law Union and Sanitary District, and the registration sub-districts of Mortimer (late 19th century) and Bucklebury (early 20th century). It was at all times an ecclesiastical <b>parish</b> <b>and</b> acquired civil parish status in the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|Historically; the {{division}} into ancient parishes {{was linked to}} the manorial system, with parishes and manors often sharing the same boundaries. However the Poor Law Amendment Act 1866 declared a divergence between the historic ecclesiastical <b>parish</b> <b>and</b> administrative functions within the locality, thus creating civil parishes. These administrative units formed the bottom-tier of local government within England and were established from 1866.|$|E

5|$|In 1766 John Egerton, Bishop of Bangor, {{appointed}} {{an elderly}} English priest, Dr Thomas Bowles, to the parish of St Beuno, Trefdraeth and its chapelry of St Cwyfan, Llangwyfan. Between them the <b>parish</b> <b>and</b> chapelry had about 500 parishioners, of whom all but five spoke only Welsh, whereas Bowles spoke only English. The parishioners and churchwardens of Trefdraeth petitioned against Bowles's appointment, {{arguing that the}} appointment of a priest who did not speak Welsh breached the Articles of Religion, the Act for the Translation of the Scriptures into Welsh 1563 and the Act of Uniformity 1662. In 1773 the Court of Arches ruled that only clergy who could speak Welsh should be appointed to Welsh-speaking parishes, and Bowles should not have been appointed, but he now held the ecclesiastical freehold of the benefice and the case to deprive him of it had not been proved. The court therefore let Bowles stay in post, which he did until he died in November of that year. Bowles was then replaced in the <b>parish</b> <b>and</b> chapelry with Richard Griffith, a priest who spoke Welsh.|$|E

5|$|St Paul's, {{commonly}} known as the Actors' Church, was built in 1633, at a cost of £4,000, though was not consecrated until 1638.

How much of Jones's original building is left is unclear, as the church was damaged by fire in 1795 during restoration work by Thomas Hardwick; the columns are thought to be original but the rest is mostly Georgian or Victorian reconstruction.|$|E
