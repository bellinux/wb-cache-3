40|$|Scattering theory methods make it {{possible}} to calculate the Casimir energy of a perfectly conducting elliptic cylinder opposite a <b>perfectly</b> <b>conducting</b> <b>plane</b> in terms of Mathieu functions. In the limit of zero radius, the elliptic cylinder becomes a finite-width strip, which allows for the study of edge effects. However, existing packages for computing Mathieu functions are insufficient for this calculation, because none can compute Mathieu functions of both the first and second kind for complex arguments. To address this shortcoming, we have written a general purpose Mathieu function package, based on algorithms developed by Alhargan [1, 2]. We use these routines to find edge corrections to the proximity force approximation for the Casimir energy of a perfectly conducting strip opposite a <b>perfectly</b> <b>conducting</b> <b>plane.</b> Comment: 9 pages, 1 figure; fixed typo...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the reflection properties of electromagnetic/optical waves in isotropic chiral media. When the chiral parameter is strong enough, {{we show that}} an unusual negative reflection occurs at the interface of the chiral medium and a <b>perfectly</b> <b>conducting</b> <b>plane,</b> where the incident wave and one of reflected eigenwaves lie in {{the same side of}} the boundary normal. Using such a property, we further demonstrate that such a conducting plane can be used for focusing in the strong chiral medium. The related equations under paraxial optics approximation are deduced. In a special case of chiral medium, the chiral nihility, one of the bi-reflections disappears and only single reflected eigenwave exists, which goes exactly opposite to the incident wave. Hence the incident and reflected electric fields will cancel each other to yield a zero total electric field. In another word, any electromagnetic waves entering the chiral nihility with <b>perfectly</b> <b>conducting</b> <b>plane</b> will disappear. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

The electron beam is treated as a number of cylinders of charge (it can be regarded as a number of layers of pencils the axes of which are parallel; these pencils can move in the two dimensions perpendicular to their axes) and space-charge forces are included by calculating the field due to these cylinders when they are placed between two <b>perfectly</b> <b>conducting</b> <b>planes.</b> The nonlinear equations are re-expressed in terms of normalized variables suitable for machine computation, and the procedure for solving these equations numerically is discussed. The equations are solved for a number of thin-beam, small-signal cases and the results are compared with previous analytical work. Numerical difficulties are encountered because the electric field approaches infinity in the neighborhood of a line charge. These difficulties are circumvented by a modification of the electric field in the vicinity of a line charge. Large-signal calculations are carried out for the special case of a thin sheet beam which would travel in a straight line in the absence of r-f effects. The computations are carried out for both forward- and backward-wave interaction by using several values of a space-charge parameter that cover typical operating conditions...|$|R
