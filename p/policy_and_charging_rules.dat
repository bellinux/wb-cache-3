40|$|International audienceThe {{numbers of}} MVNOs (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) are growing globally, but so do their {{operational}} and business issues. This paper identifies {{these issues and}} looks for remedies via the new 4 G architecture and interfaces. The paper examines the "Full" MVNO model as a "Home" network in a pseudo roaming scenario (National Roaming), allowing MVNO to connect to multiple MNOs through the discovery and selection process, and {{to benefit from the}} access agnostic nature of EPS (Enhanced Packet System). Greater MVNO independence can resolve many of the MVNO's underlying issues, e. g. launching services <b>and</b> variable <b>charging</b> that are enabled by IMS Voice and non-Voice. Other persisting issues are solved by the MVNO defining user centric policies that are conveyed to the MNO transport network through new interfaces for the Policy & <b>Charging</b> <b>Rules</b> Function (PCRF). Particular issues can be resolved by integrating the User Data Repository (UDR) with <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>charging</b> <b>rules.</b> MVNO also need to support the value chain via "Sponsored Data" from service/content providers and receive Traffic Detection Function (TDF) reports on user context and behaviour. This paper argues that these features strengthen the Full MVNO position in the layered business model in EPS, and that the identified issues are substantially alleviated...|$|R
30|$|Modern mobile {{networks}} are experiencing excessive traffic loads due the {{sharp increase in}} smart devices that are connected (e.g., smart phone, IoT devices, etc.) {{as well as the}} introduction of new services and applications. The rate of growth in network use is a challenge for current mobile network architectures due to the increase in complexity for operation and management, high upgrade costs, and slow time‐to‐market for new innovations and services. The 3 GPP LTE/EPC and LTE‐A standards were released to cope with the increased demand for high‐speed mobile networks. However, several issues related to the inherent design of these architectures necessitate radical changes. The 3 GPP technical specification (TS 23.401) [1] indicates that the LTE/EPC architecture is composed of four main entities including an eNB, a mobility management entity (MME), a serving gateway (SGW), and a PDN gateway (PGW). Two additional entities related to subscriber management as well as <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>charging</b> management include a home subscriber server (HSS) <b>and</b> a <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>charging</b> <b>rule</b> function (PCRF). The MME is the main control entity and is responsible for maintaining the mobility states of the UEs as well as setting up the bearer and forwarding path to carry the user traffic. The user data packets are then forwarded through the GTP tunnels (GPRS tunneling protocol) between the eNB and the PGW.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Novel mobile {{cellular}} {{access network}} technologies like Long Term Evolution (LTE) promise capacities exceeding the ones of existing 3 G networks {{by at least}} one order of magnitude. This evolution will enable the deployment of services which, due to their capacity requirements, are currently restricted to fixed access networks. On the other hand, packet-switched-only architectures raise the need for a reliable and accurate management of these high access capacities, particularly service-specific Quality of Service (QoS) enforcement, in order to prioritize real-time (voice) services and safeguard a satisfactory Quality of Experience (QoE) to the user. In this paper we present the concept and architecture of a flow-based QoS enforcement architecture called BIQINI which has been developed at the Telecommunications Research Center Vienna (FTW). It consists of a standard-compliant <b>Policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>Charging</b> <b>Rules</b> Function (PCRF) which is supported by an emulated Policy Enforcement Function (PCEF). Extending the FOKUS OpenSource IMS testbed as well as other session-based signaling frameworks, BIQINI’s emulated enforcement component enables inexpensive but highly realistic tests on real-time voice and-video traffic, supporting impairments like delay, jitter, loss, and link capacity limitation out-of-the-box. In addition, BIQINI can interface with external policy repositories, thus providing a versatile playground for testing rules and policies in an emulated, realistic environment for real media streams...|$|E

40|$|The Third Generation Partnership Project {{specifies}} {{a solution}} to handle the heterogeneity of future networks, including quality of service (QoS) <b>and</b> <b>charging</b> aspects. This solution utilizes a policy-based approach based on the <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>charging</b> control (PCC) architecture, which is an integral component of the evolved packet system (EPS). The specifications for EPS are being finalized with the evolved packet core (EPC) central to this framework. The EPC is a simplified, flat, all IP-based architecture that supports mobility between heterogeneous access networks and incorporates an evolved QoS concept based on the PCC framework. A critical open issue within EPS is the provisioning of end-to-end QoS enabled paths. This article proposes enhancements to the EPC/PCC framework that extend the end-to-end inter-domain mechanisms to discover the signaling routes at the service control layer, and use this information to determine the paths traversed by the media at the resource control layer. Because the approach operates at these layers, it is compatible with existing transport networks and exploits already existing QoS control mechanisms.
