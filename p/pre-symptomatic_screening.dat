40|$|Background: Necrotizing {{enterocolitis}} (NEC) is {{an inflammatory}} bowel disease affecting premature infants. The disease can progress rapidly and is associated with high mortality. Early diagnosis can be difficult as the early manifestations of NEC can be very similar to sepsis. There is currently no <b>pre-symptomatic</b> <b>screening</b> method available. The aim of the work reported in this thesis was to identify microbial signatures in the gastrointestinal microbiota preceding NEC diagnosis in premature infants. Methods: Longitudinal (≥ daily) faecal samples and daily clinical data from throughout their neonatal intensive care unit stay were collected from 369 premature infants born at < 32 weeks gestation over a two-year period. The faecal microbiota of 12 infants with definite/severe NEC, 8 with suspected NEC, and 44 control infants was characterised using next-generation sequencing of 16 S ribosomal RNA gene regions. Clinical characteristics and operational taxonomical units (OTUs) that discriminated cases from controls were identified using logistic regression. Bacteria isolated from stored faecal samples underwent selective culture, and the resulting isolates were identified using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight. Isolates identified as Clostridium perfringens were additionally typed and screened {{for the presence of}} toxin genes. Results: Faecal samples collected from four NEC infants just prior to diagnosis were found to contain a higher abundance of a clostridial OTU compared to matched control samples. Culture investigation identified this OTU as Clostridium perfringens. No two Clostridium perfringens isolates were found to be identical, as determined by fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism. Infants with NEC who did not have an over-abundance of the clostridial OTU (n= 7) prior to diagnosis had a faecal microbiota dominated by a Klebsiella OTU. Only one infant did not have an abundance of either the clostridial OTU or the Klebsiella OTU. The use of prolonged continuous positive airway pressure therapy with supplemental oxygen (CPAP oxygen) was also found to be associated with NEC risk. Conclusions: Two OTUs (Clostridium and Klebsiella) were identified at high levels in faecal samples collected from infants prior to NEC diagnosis. A screening tool incorporating these biomarkers with the duration of CPAP oxygen use may aid the clinician in making an early diagnosis of NEC. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|Lung {{cancer has}} become one of the most common leading causes of {{mortality}} world-wide. <b>Pre-symptomatic</b> <b>screening</b> seems to be the most promising strategy in the fighting against the disease. The understanding of the mechanisms of the immune system, which are implicated in the defense against malignancy, are the key in prevention and treatment. In recent years different studies have demonstrated conflicting results about the role of the immune system in lung cancer. Despite the progress that has been done to date in tumor immunology only a few studies are referred to the activation of the immune system and lung cancer. In this study, we aimed to investigate the lymphocyte subpopulations (CD 3, CD 4, CD 8 και CD 57) that infiltrate cancer nests and the stroma of the tumor and TNF-α that is expressed from neoplasmatic cells and to correlate these with a) clinicopathological variables (tumor stage, size of the tumor, histological type), b) patient survival and c) the relationship of the above variables among them in 104 tissue specimens from patients with NSCLC. Seventy five patients were classified as stage I and II (72, 1 %) and twenty nine as stage IIIA and IIIB (27, 9 %). The size of the tumor was 5 cm in forty two specimens (40, 8 %). There was no data about the size of one specimen. Of the 104 NSCLC 51 (49 %) were adenocarcinomas and 53 (51 %) squamous cell carcinomas. The expression of CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, CD 57 and TNF-α was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. We demonstrated that there was a positive correlation between TNF-α negative specimens and survival. Furthermore the non-expression of TNF-α was significantly higher in stages I and II (p< 0, 05). No correlation was observed between TNF-α and the rest of the clinicopathological variables (tumor size, histological type). The negativeness for TNF-α was the only prognostic factor that could predict a favorable outcome. Despite the fact that the counts of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes subpopulations were low, there was no association between the lymphocyte subpopulations the clinicopathological variables and survival respectively. There was also no correlation among the variables (CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, CD 57, TNF-α) that were studied. Conclusively, our study confirms the immunosuppressive role of NSCLC in the micro- environment of the tumor in the early stages of the disease. ...|$|E
40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the most {{commonly}} diagnosed cancer among women and {{a leading cause of}} death in both developed and developing countries. Although the use of mammography seems to be effective in mortality reduction, and there is extensive evidence on the importance of <b>pre-symptomatic</b> <b>screening</b> programmes, Greece has no national breast cancer screening programme for women, except some isolated local activities. Especially in primary health care (PHC), participation of women in these programmes is low and there is no data available with regards to women undergoing periodic mammography screening. Despite efforts to improve the knowledge and skills of public health professionals in carrying out breast cancer screening preventive programmes, the Greek reality remains far from the systematic implementation of national guidelines for breast cancer screening. In Crete, to date, factors that influence the use of mammography have not been investigated. The aims of this study were the following: 1. To examine the attitudes, beliefs and knowledge of midlife women in Crete about the use and value of mammography. 2. To investigate {{the degree to which the}} different social-economical factors affect the knowledge, attitudes and practices of these women in the use of mammography. 3. To present the most common reasons that women mention for refusing mammography and what influences their views. 4. To set out the reasons that health professionals consider responsible for refusal of mammography use and to which degree they are able to affect it. 5. To examine the degree to which physicians follow the international guidelines about the use of mammography and what practices they should follow to affect it. 6. To investigate the degree to which physicians inform women about the benefits and risks from the use of mammography. Methods The study was conducted with semi-structured individual interviews. Two interview schedules were used (one for physicians, and one for women). In addition, we used the questionnaire “Cancer Control Practices” (CCP), developed in the USA, after it was translated and validated according to international standards, and completed as a self-administered survey to investigate physicians’ knowledge. Setting The study was conducted in the 14 primary health care centers (PHCCs) that serve the rural population of Crete and in the outpatient clinics of University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete. Participants: Primary Health Care Centres of Crete 16 A. Interviews March to April 2004 · Thirty women 45 - 65 years of age, permanent residents of rural areas of Crete, attending a regular check-up appointment with a GP or internist. · Twenty-eight qualified primary care physicians serving this rural population, selected at random and recruited on the morning shift for an interview. B. Questionnaire · All 106 general practitioners (n= 91) and internists (n= 15), employed as of October 2004 and practicing at participating PHCCs were included. In addition, we included a random sample of 45 trainee general practitioners (GPs) from a total of 83 working at the 14 PHCCs of Crete. University Hospital of Heraklion A. Interviews April 8 to June 28, 2005 · Thirty women 45 - 65 years of age, permanent residents of Heraklion, selected at random and recruited from the list of regular appointments at hospital clinics. · Sixteen randomly selected physicians from the respective clinics of University Hospital. B. Questionnaire · 8 physicians for pilot test · All trainee GPs (19) for test, re-test Results A. Attitudes and practices of physicians and women Of the 30 women in PHC settings, 15 had not used mammography, and very few of them had made the decision after being informed adequately or being given a recommendation by their physician. The principal barriers were: absence of symptoms (9), fear of radiation (7), lack of physician recommendation (6), pain from previous experience (5), fear of a serious diagnosis (4), lack of knowledge about the benefits (2), lack of free time and family obligations (4), embarrassment (4), living far away from the screening site (1) and the cost in private centers (2). The majority of physicians (20) in PHC seemed to be well informed about mammography and recognized the importance of their recommendation (16). Five physicians mentioned lack of time for discussion with women due to a large number of patients. Only eight physicians stated that they recommend it to all women according to international guidelines. The factors affecting women’s use of mammography were: socio-economic/demographic factors of women (23), lack of appointments and problems with waiting times in public hospital (14), the distance for elderly women (8), the cost in private centers (9), the absence of symptoms (12), cancer diagnosis in a family member or loved one (6), embarrassment (3), lack of time and family obligations (2), fear of diagnosis (4), fear of radiation (8), and physician’s gender (16). 17...|$|E

In the context of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) an even more comprehensive screening is advised because PITs are presumed to manifest more aggressive behavior. We studied the long-term course of MEN 1 -related PITs, which may be used as a model for sporadically occurring PITs. The aim of our study is to assess the results of systematic <b>pre-symptomatic</b> PIT <b>screening</b> and subsequent long-term followup of PITs with emphasis on nonfunctioning microadenomas diagnosed by screening. A cohort study was performed using the Dutch national MEN 1 database, including greater than 90 % of the Dutch MEN 1 population older than 16 years (n = 323). Screening results, natural course, and effects of treatment of PIT were assessed. PIT was diagnosed in 123 patients with MEN 1 (38. 1 %), of whom 66 were diagnosed by MEN 1 -related screening. Ninety-one percent of the nonfunctioning PIT detected during screening (n = 35), did not require intervention during followup (median, 6. 0 y). Three microadenomas showed limited growth but did not progress toward macroadenomas. Both screening-detected and prevalent prolactinomas (n = 52) responded well to treatment with dopamine agonists. Systematic presymptomatic screening for PIT in patients with MEN 1 predominantly results in detection of nonfunctioning microadenomas.
