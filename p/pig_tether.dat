40|$|Although the {{consequences}} of stress and hypercortisolemia for the rodent hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) are well known, {{little is known about}} other species. For <b>pigs,</b> <b>tethered</b> housing represents a well-established chronic stressor that shares many similarities with restraint paradigms, as evidenced by profound changes in behavior and autonomic and endocrine dysfunction, including flattened cortisol rhythms and hypercortisolemia all conditions that may threaten hippocampal viability in rat. Here, we studied structural parameters of the porcine DG after 5 months of tethered housing in relation to basal saliva cortisol measured antemortem. We further investigated whether any neuropathology or alterations in apoptosis had occurred in the left hippocampal hemisphere. Stereological analysis revealed high correlations between DG volume and neuron number in individual animals in both hemispheres. Within individual animals, neuron numbers of the left and right lobes were not correlated. Notably, basal cortisol was negatively correlated with volume and neuron number of the left, but not the right DG. Although obvious neuropathology was absent, apoptosis was present in DG and alveus and less so in CA areas. Despite the short window of time during which apoptosis is detectable, their stereologically estimated numbers in the DG, but not in other regions, were negatively correlated with cortisol. In conclusion, our data indicate {{for the first time a}} profound lateralization in the relationship between DG structure, apoptosis, and basal cortisol after stress in pigs. Five months of chronic stress failed to induce lasting neuropathology. Although accumulating changes in apoptosis could have contributed to the structural DG alterations, further studies should reveal whether stress has been instrumental, or whether the differences between animals were present from birth onward. The present lateralization after stress is, however, consistent with lateralized hippocampal volume changes in stress-related human disorders and suggests that these effects are not limited to this species alone...|$|R
40|$|Formulation of {{exclusively}} organic diets {{that meet}} maintenance and production requirements of dairy cattle {{is a major}} limitation to production of premium organic products of animal origin. This study was therefore carried out to assess the use and availability of feed resources and the coping strategies used by farmers to overcome dry season feed shortages on 64 smallholder certified organic pineapple farms. Data was collected using semi-structured questionnaires and two focus group discussions. Majority of households were headed by males (62. 9 %) while average age of respondents was 42. 5 years. Farmers allocated more land (P< 0. 05) to organic pineapple production compared to livestock. Beside dairy cattle, farmers also kept chickens, goats and <b>pigs.</b> <b>Tethering</b> was the commonest cattle management system. Fifty three percent of respondents reported using both natural pastures and crop residues as major dairy cattle feed resources while only 19 % reported using elephant grass. Banana peels (25. 1 %) and sweet potato vines (24. 7 %) {{were the most important}} crop residues fed to cattle. Farmers reported high cost of concentrates and scarcity of feeds as their biggest challenges in dairy cattle production. Of the respondents, 51. 4 % conserved feed for their cattle as fodder banks. As a coping strategy to feed shortages, majority (42. 9 %) of farmer scavenged for feed resources from both organic certified and nonorganic neighbouring farms which is contrary to organic livestock farming standards. It was, therefore, concluded that management of livestock feeding in the study area fell short of the requirements for organic livestock feeding standards. Research to develop strategies that can use alternative on-farm feed resources through ensiling organic pineapple wastes during the dry season is recommended as a long term strategy to address feed challenges for organic livestock farmers...|$|R
40|$|In Lao People’s Democratic Republic pigs {{are kept}} {{in close contact with}} families. Human risk of {{infection}} with pig zoonoses arises from direct contact and consumption of unsafe pig products. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Luang Prabang (north) and Savannakhet (central-south) Provinces. A total of 59 villages, 895 humans and 647 pigs were sampled and serologically tested for zoonotic pathogens including: hepatitis E virus (HEV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and Trichinella spiralis; In addition, human sera were tested for Taenia spp. and cysticercosis. Seroprevalence of zoonotic pathogens in humans was high for HEV (Luang Prabang: 48. 6 %, Savannakhet: 77. 7 %) and T. spiralis (Luang Prabang: 59. 0 %, Savannakhet: 40. 5 %), and lower for JEV (around 5 %), Taenia spp. (around 3 %) and cysticercosis (Luang Prabang: 6. 1, Savannakhet 1. 5 %). Multiple correspondence analysis and hierarchical clustering of principal components was performed on descriptive data of human hygiene practices, contact with pigs and consumption of pork products. Three clusters were identified: Cluster 1 had low pig contact and good hygiene practices, but had higher risk of T. spiralis. Most people in cluster 2 were involved in pig slaughter (83. 7 %), handled raw meat or offal (99. 4 %) and consumed raw pigs’ blood (76. 4 %). Compared to cluster 1, cluster 2 had increased odds of testing seropositive for HEV and JEV. Cluster 3 had the lowest sanitation access and had the highest risk of HEV, cysticercosis and Taenia spp. Farmers which kept their <b>pigs</b> <b>tethered</b> (as opposed to penned) and disposed of manure in water sources had 0. 85 (95 % CI: 0. 18 to 0. 91) and 2. 39 (95 % CI: 1. 07 to 5. 34) times the odds of having pigs test seropositive for HEV, respectively.

40|$|IntroductionThe {{main purpose}} of the studies {{described}} in this thesis was to gain more insight in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocorticaI (HPA) system and the mechanisms underlying adaptation to chronic stress in female pigs. The function of the HPA axis, which coordinates multiple neuroendocrine and metabolic responses to stressors, has been subject of extensive basic and clinical research. HPA-activation by stressful stimuli results {{in an increase in}} circulating adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and consequently of glucocorticoid hormones. A brief review of stress and HPA functions is given in Chapter 1. It has been demonstrated in a variety of species that exposure to chronic or repeated stress may induce long-term changes in the regulation of the HPA axis. These changes may occur at the following levels: 1) extrahypothalarnic centers modulating the activity of neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus that secrete corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and/or other ACTH secretagogues; 2) hypothalamic sites releasing ACTH secretagogues; 3) ACTH-secreting cells in the anterior lobe of the pituitary; 4) glucocorticoid secreting cells in the adrenal cortex. This project was mainly focussed on the regulation of pituitary-adrenocortical function during chronic stress. Long-term restraint of female pigs by a neck-tether was used as a chronic stress paradigm. Previous studies have demonstrated that <b>tethered</b> <b>pigs</b> may develop behavioural, hormonal, and cardiovascular disturbances characteristic for chronic stress. In Chapters 2 and 3 of this thesis we showed that prolonged tethered housing leads to a sustained elevation of basal plasma cortisol concentrations. Chapters 4, 5 and 6 provide evidence that chronic stress may induce long-term changes {{at the level of the}} adrenal cortex, resulting in increased steroidogenic capacity and sensitivity for ACTH. No change was found in the sensitivity of the pituitary for CRH or vasopressin. There was no indication for an increase in basal ACTH levels, but the ACTH response to a superimposed acute stress appeared to be reduced during chronic stress. The hypersecretion of cortisol may therefore well be a consequence of stress- induced changes in adrenocortical function. Moreover, chronic stress leads to an increase in the activity of- opioid systems that inhibit pituitary-adrenal responses to additional acute stressors. These alterations in opioid systems may be of adaptive value in that they prevent excessive reactions of the pituitary-adrenal system during chronic stress. This may also underlie the transient nature of the hypercortisolaemia. Pituitary-Adrenocortical Function after Chronic StressHypercortisolaemiaThere is ample evidence, particularly from studies in the rat, that repeated exposure to stressors may produce an increase in the activity of the adrenocortical system, as evidenced by increased circulating corticosteroid concentrations andlor adrenocortical hypertrophy and increased adrenal weight Indeed, in female pigs we found that chronic stress induces long-term elevated basal cortisol levels (Chapters 2 and 3). This hypercortisolaemia, which develops within the first weeks of tethered housing, is evident in every phase of the oestrous cycle of the pigs. It is particularly obvious during the luteal phase of the oestrous cycle when cortisol levels remain rather stable (Chapter 2). In addition, our data reveal circadian differences in the effect of chronic stress on HPA- regulation. Elevated cortisol concentrations are most pronounced in the evening, i. e. during the nadir of cortisol secretion, and lead to a flattened diurnal rhythm of cortisol secretion during chronic restraint stress (Chapter 3). These findings correspond with observations in rats and in man, that chronic stressinduced corticosteroid levels are increased during the trough of circadian adrenocortical activity Determination of cortisol over a 24 -hour period demonstrated that elevated evening cortisol concentrations during chronic stress are not the result of a stress-induced shift in the phase of the cortisol rhythm (Chapter 3). Chronic stress may conceivably cause "facilitation" of the HPA system, either by increasing its sensitivity to stimulus input or by decreasing its sensitivity to negative glucocorticoid feedback, or both, so that elevated corticosteroid concentrations are maintained throughout the period of stress. It is well-known that ACTH has a trophic effect on the adrenal cortex. Prolonged ACTH stimulation (e. g., during chronic stress) may therefore lead to hypertrophic enlargement of the adrenal gland, resulting in increased output of glucocorticoids in response to this peptide with time. Furthermore, in rats it has been reported that chronic stress may result in a persistent decrease in feedback sensitivity to corticosteroids. Akana and co-workers have suggested that there is a high sensitivity to glucocorticoid feedback during the trough of the circadian corticosteroid rhythm, accompanied by a diminished (or absent) circadian-dependent drive to CRH secretion in rats. Moreover, they suggested that the circadian rise in plasma corticocosteroid levels is a result of stimulated CRH secretion as a consequence of diminished sensitivity to steroid feedback. One may speculate that the increase in evening, but not in morning plasma cortisol levels during chronic stress, described in Chapter 3, is in part the result of stress-induced changes in feedback sensitivity to circulating cortisol. In other words, the hypothalamus remains insensitive to cortisol, resulting in increased cortisol levels throughout the day. Increased Sensitivity and Capacity of the Adrenal CortexWe found that the chronic hypersecretion of cortisol in <b>tethered</b> <b>pigs</b> does not coincide with an increase in plasma levels of β-endorphin (Chapter 2), a peptide co-secreted with ACTH from the pituitary corticotroph cell. It may therefore be inferred that the hypercortisolaemia is not a reflection of a sustained increase in ACTH release from the pituitary, although basal plasma ACTH levels were not measured in those experiments. Several reports in rats, showing that elevated glucocorticoid levels during exposure to chronic stress are not necessarily associated with significant increases in plasma ACTH, support this contention. Our data (Chapters 4, 5 and 6) provide evidence for stress-induced changes in HPA- regulation. In <b>pigs</b> <b>tethered</b> for a period of 10 - 11 weeks, the ACTH response to a superimposed stressor (acute nose-sling stress) appears to be reduced as compared with loose housing, whereas the cortisol response remains unaltered (Chapter 5). These data indicate that the sensitivity of the adrenal cortex to circulating ACTH increases as a result of chronic stress. This finding is supported by the study described in Chapter 6, in which the cortisol/ACTH ratio after CRH treatment in <b>tethered</b> <b>pigs</b> shows a two-fold increase when compared with loose housed pigs. Moreover, challenge with exogenous ACTH(1 - 24) reveals that the capacity of the adrenal cortex to secrete cortisol increases during chronic stress (Chapter 4), which is in line with findings of other studies in pigs 1 and other species. This increase in adrenocortical capacity may result from a hypertrophic enlargement of the adrenal gland. All in all, our observations point to the adrenal cortex as one of the dominant sites where functional changes occur during chronic stress. We speculate that these changes in adrenocortical function may well underlie the hypercortisolaemia in <b>tethered</b> <b>pigs</b> (Chapters 2 and 3). Although ACTH is generally considered to be the most important factor in the control of glucocorticoid secretion from the adrenal cortex, there is increasing evidence that steroidogenesis is also under control of neural inputs at the level of the adrenal gland, which can modulate adrenocortical sensitivity to ACTH and thereby control the secretory activity of the adrenal cortex. In rats it has been reported that locally secreted CRH is likely to mediate such an increase in adrenal sensitivity to ACTH by stimulating the blood flow through the adrenal gland, although, to our knowledge, no such mechanism has (yet) been demonstrated in the pig. In this context, it is interesting to note that a challenge with vasopressin in our study produced an approximately five-fold greater cortisol/ACTH ratio than a challenge with CRH (Chapter 6). This implies that in the pig, vasopressin can stimulate corticosteroidogenesis beyond that induced by vasopressin-stimulated ACTH release, possibly by a direct effect on the adrenal gland. In addition, our data indicate a synergism between vasopressin and CRH in their cortisol releasing effects. which may also result from a vasopressin-induced increase in the responsiveness of the adrenal cortex to ACTH. Effects of Housing Conditions on Adrenocortical CapacityIt was interesting to find in our study that housing factors different from the physical restraint of tethered housing per se play a role in the development of adaptive changes in the steroidogenic capacity of the adrenal cortex during chronic stress. We showed that the increase in the cortisol response to challenge with exogenous ACTH(1 - 24) is considerably more pronounced and persistent in <b>tethered</b> <b>pigs</b> deprived of visual and tactile contacts with conspecifics and with very limited visual control over the environment, than in <b>tethered</b> <b>pigs</b> that have such possibilities, albeit to a limited degree (Chapter 4). The least restricted pigs were separated by horizontal bars, thus allowing social contacts with neighbouring pigs and visual control over the environment. In the most restricted pigs, closed partitions between the pens precluded social interactions and severely limited their visual range. It seems likely that the relative lack of visual information from the environment reduces the predictability of environmental changes and increases|$|R

In {{order to determine}} the characteristics of this type of production system, a cross-sectional questionnaire survey on farm characteristics and management was collected from 182 farmers in Busia District. The mean farm size was one acre, while the mean number of pigs per farm was 3. 6. Pigs were mainly kept as a source of income (98 %) and majority were of cross breed variety (64 %). The production systems included farrow to weaner (12 %), porker to finisher (36 %), and mixed (46 %). Sixty five percent (65 %) of the <b>pigs</b> were <b>tethered</b> and housing was not provided in 61 % of the farms. Most of the feeds were sourced locally. Lack of castration and delayed weaning of pigs was observed on 49 % and 30 % of the farms, respectively. The main production constraints included pig diseases (81 %) and high cost or lack of feed (81 %). Haematopinus suis infestations and worm infections were considered {{to be the most important}} diseases by 71 % and 55 % of the farmers, respectively. Farmers had moderate knowledge on parasitic disease diagnosis with 31 % and 62 % not having a history of either deworming or spraying pigs with acaricides, respectively. Marketing constraints were common amongst the farmers and included poor prices and inadequate market information. In conclusion, the production system was characterized as low-input with an income objective.

40|$|Opioid {{receptor}} densities {{were measured}} in the hippocampus of chronically stressed (<b>tethered)</b> <b>pigs</b> to study the involvement of endogenous opioid systems in stereotypy performance. Three groups of animals were housed tethered for 2 (n = 12), 5. 5 (n = 12) and 8 - 9 months (n = 8), respectively, {{and the intensity of}} stereotypy performance was determined. Opioid receptor densities were measured post mortem, using membrane binding assays with [3 H]naloxone as a ligand. A negative correlation was found between the density of opioid receptors and the intensity of stereotypy performance in the animals that had been housed tethered for 2 months. This correlation seemed to disappear with increasing duration of tethered housing. The data further suggest that, associated with the duration of tethered housing, there was a gradual decrease in the density of opioid receptors in the left hippocampal lobe of the low-stereotyping animals, but not in the right lobe, nor in the left and right lobes of the high-stereotypers. This suggests that chronic stress leads to a (asymmetrically expressed) progressive loss of opioid receptors in the hippocampus, and that stereotypies exert a mitigating effect on stress-induced changes in opioid receptor densities, supporting the hypothesis that stereotypies help the animals cope with the adverse effects of chronic stress...|$|R

The risk factors for taeniosis were assessed and evaluated through questionnaires, interviews and by direct observation. Of 308 pigs examined by lingual palpation, 23 (7. 5 %, p< 0. 001) had cysticerci; the prevalence rates was higher in male pigs than female 16 (69. 5 %) and 7 (30. 4 %), respectively. Likewise the prevalence was higher in villages away from the main roads where there were pigs that customarily ran loose or fed human feaces.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: To {{estimate}} the lifetime prevalence of neurocysticercosis (NCC) -associated epilepsy {{and the proportion}} of NCC among people with epilepsy in three Burkina Faso villages. METHODS: Three villages were selected to represent three types of pig-rearing methods: (1) Batondo, where pigs are left to roam; (2) Pabré, where <b>pigs</b> are mostly <b>tethered</b> or penned; and (3) Nyonyogo, where the majority of residents are Muslim and few pigs are raised. In Batondo and Nyonyogo, all concessions (a group of several households) were included. Half of the concessions in Pabré were randomly chosen. All households of selected concessions were included, and one person per household was randomly selected for epilepsy screening and serologic testing for cysticercosis. Self-reported cases of epilepsy were also examined and confirmed cases included in analyses other than the estimate of NCC-associated epilepsy prevalence. Epilepsy was defined as ever having had more than one episode of unprovoked seizures. Individuals with medically confirmed epilepsy had a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the brain before and after contrast medium injection. The diagnosis of NCC was made using a modification of the criteria of Del Brutto et al. KEY FINDINGS: Thirty-nine (4 %) of 888 randomly selected villagers and 33 (94 %) of 35 self-reported seizures cases were confirmed to have epilepsy by medical examination. Among the 68 participants with epilepsy who had a CT scan, 20 patients were diagnosed with definitive or probable NCC for a proportion of 46. 9 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 30. 2 - 64. 1) in Batondo and 45. 5 % (95 % CI 19. 0 - 74. 1) in Pabré. No cases of NCC were identified in Nyonyogo. SIGNIFICANCE: All the definitive and probable cases of NCC were from the two villages where pig breeding is common. Prevention policies intended to reduce the burden of epilepsy in this country should include measures designed to interrupt the life cycle of Taenia solium...|$|R

Materials and Methods: A total of 11 % (1350 / 12783) of all {{households in the}} Nangabo Sub-County kept pigs. The systematic sampling technique was used to complete the list of all pig farming households. This was done by taking 10 th farming household until 10 % of all the farming households were sampled. A total of 135 farmers were interviewed with semi- structured questionnaire. Questionnaire data was entered into Microsoft Excel worksheet and trans-ferred into Statistical Package for Social Scientists Results: Results indicated that 49. 6 % of the pigs were raised in the semi-intensive system while 31 %, 12 % and 8 % of the farmers kept <b>pigs</b> on intensive, <b>tethering</b> and free range rearing systems respectively. Farmers that raised their pigs on what is hereby referred to as semi-intensive and intensive management systems allowed their pigs up to five and two hours of open foraging respectively. Ninety eight percent of the farmers provided housing to their pigs and the commonest pig houses were local mud houses {{and a few of}} them were tree shades. Majority of farmers (85. 2 %) watered their pigs at least once a day. The major factors limiting pig production were; diseases and parasites mainly helminthosis and African swine fever (ASF). Others included; high costs of inputs, lack of capital, unstable availability of feed resources, inadequate advisory services and feed price fluctuation (maize bran, sow and weaner), lack of good quality breeding stock, poor and unorganized marketing, lack of enough land, high costs of veterinary medicines and inability to keep records. Additionally, lack of enough water and uncontrolled pig movement grossly limited the pig production in Wakiso district. Most Ugandans keep their pigs in peri-urban areas of Uganda. It was however, noted that there were important limitations for pig production in the country. To improve pig production and reduce animal protein deficit, knowledge on constraints to pig production was important to inform pig sector promotion stakeholders. Conclusion: Limitations to pig farming including parasites and diseases, ASF, nutritional deficiencies, high cost of inputs like building materials, drugs and veterinary services, inadequate capital and failure of farmers to access credit services, expensive feeds among others were identified and should be addressed to meet national animal protein requirements.
