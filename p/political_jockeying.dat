25|$|North Korean State media did {{not report}} Jong-il's death until 51 hours after it occurred, {{apparently}} due to the <b>political</b> <b>jockeying</b> and discussions that surrounded the official version of Jong-il's legacy, as well as agreeing upon {{the membership of the}} Funeral Committee of Kim Jong-il. On the morning of 19 December, all work units, schools, government agencies, and military personnel were informed of a major announcement to take place at noon.

Nanda became acting prime minister but only until the new Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri was nominated to succeed Nehru. Shastri continued working with Hills and had his staff prepare a budget request for Parliament to fund the chlorella algae project. However, because it competed with traditional agricultural interests, the aquaculture project became victim to <b>political</b> <b>jockeying</b> as well as an outbreak of war with Pakistan. With Shastri's mysterious death at the 1966 India-Pakistan peace conference in Tashkent, the project lost its key sponsor.|$|E

Chester Cooper, former director of Asian affairs for the White House, explained why the impetus came from the United States instead of from the Republic of South Vietnam: [...] "The 'More Flags' campaign... required the application of considerable pressure for Washington to elicit any meaningful commitments.

5000|$|From {{the early}} days of the Muslim conquests, Arab armies were divided into regiments drawn from {{individual}} tribes or tribal confederations (butun or ‘asha‘ir). Despite the fact that many of these groupings were recent creations, created for reasons of military efficiency rather than any common ancestry, they soon developed a strong and distinct identity. by the beginning of the Umayyad period, this system progressed to the formation of ever-larger super-groupings, culminating in the two super-groups: the northern Arab Mudaris or Qaysis, and the south Arabs or [...] "Yemenis" [...] (Yaman), dominated by the Azd and Rabi'ah tribes. By the 8th century, this division had become firmly established across the Caliphate and was a source of constant internal instability, as the two groups formed in essence two rival <b>political</b> parties, <b>jockeying</b> for power and separated by a fierce hatred for each other. During Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik's reign, the Umayyad government appointed Mudaris as governors in Khurasan, except for Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri's tenure in 735-738. Nasr's appointment came four months after Asad's death. In the interim, the sources report variously that the province was run either by the Syrian general Ja'far ibn Hanzala al-Bahrani or by Asad's lieutenant Juday' al-Kirmani. At any rate, the sources agree that al-Kirmani stood at the time as the most prominent man in Khurasan and should have been the clear choice for governor. His Yemeni roots (he was the leader of the Azd in Khurasan), however, made him unpalatable to the Caliph.|$|R

40|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the first episode of HBO 2 ̆ 7 s {{critically}} acclaimed historical drama Deadwood, an ordinary gold miner, Ellsworth (Jim Beaver), walks into the Gem Saloon, owned by Al Swearengen (Ian McShane), and proclaims: 2 ̆ 2 I may 2 ̆ 7 a fucked my life up flatter than hammered shit, but I stand before you today, beholden to no human cocksuckers. And workin 2 ̆ 7 a payin 2 ̆ 7 fuckin 2 ̆ 7 gold claim. 2 ̆ 2 Ellsworth has established a gold claim in the Black Hills of the future South Dakota, and his proclamation of autonomy flows from the power and freedom gold delivers, even in the lawless town of Deadwood. At {{this point in the}} series, Ellsworth is a simple miner, a representative of the men who swarmed the hills in the 1870 s to reap the rewards of untapped gold reserves. In the poetics of Western discourse, he seeks the company of whores in the evening and the solitude of the hills when he awakes. In Deadwood, he is just another denizen trying to escape a previous life and carve out an existence free from the confines of civilization. As the narrative progresses over three TV seasons, Ellsworth 2 ̆ 7 s transformation comes to represent the evolving nature of the town itself, as he shifts from being an outsider on the fringes to being at the center of local politics. His marriage of convenience (her convenience, not his) to the widow Alma Garret (Molly Parker) thrusts him out of his comfortable self-reliance and reluctantly into the convolut! ons of <b>political</b> and economic <b>jockeying</b> that threaten the town 2 ̆ 7 s survival. His only resistance is to the monomaniacal George Hearst (Gerald McRaney), and it is at the hands of Hearst 2 ̆ 7 s henchman that Ellsworth finally meets an unjustified and violent end. Reading the narrative arc of Deadwoodthe town and the series-through the development of Ellsworth 2 ̆ 7 s character shows the underlying effect of the settlement of the West on the individual settler and the individual 2 ̆ 7 s repeated powerlessness against the momentum of history. Like Ellsworth, the town of Deadwood moves from hinterland settlement to economic gold mine, literally, and the source of considerable political anxiety for the government authorities. We see in Deadwood, through Ellsworth, a formal tragedy of the settlement of the American West, a thought that series creator David Milch echoes: 2 ̆ 2 Deadwood, like other gold rush towns, was a kind of reenactment of the founding of our country. 2 ̆ 2 The story of Deadwood {{is the story of the}} settlement of our nation, and as such it demands critical exploration. That the series portrays this narrative over the course of just three seasons, let alone within the character arc of one seemingly minor character, shows the latent potential of television, which has only just begun to manifest itself in recent years...|$|R

50|$|Prorogations {{of three}} years were not {{uncommon}} during this period, and the Senate begins to assign commands predetermined at three years or more in length. G.

On more than one occasion, Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great") received imperium pro consule before he ever held a magistracy — at first from the Senate, then by vote of the People, the latter perhaps indicative of the revival of popularist politics. Given the extended prorogations, the five-year proconsular commands assigned to Julius Caesar in Gaul and Marcus Crassus in Syria are less exceptional than they have sometimes been regarded; it could be argued that the five-year appointment was a realistic assessment of the time required to accomplish the task, and avoided the uncertainty, delays, and <b>political</b> <b>jockeying</b> of year-by-year prorogation.|$|E

5000|$|The {{election}} of a plebeian to succeed an impeccably pedigreed Aemilius Papus was predictably controversial, even though the office of curio maximus had become [...] "anachronistic and somewhat bizarre," [...] and the {{election of}} both a plebeian pontifex maximus as early as 254 BC and rex sacrorum just the previous year would have seemed to clear the way. When the patricians objected to the candidacy of C. Mamilius Atellus, the tribunes of the plebs, who normally withheld themselves from religious affairs, were called in. They followed procedure by referring the matter to the Senate, who promptly tossed it back to them. <b>Political</b> <b>jockeying</b> no longer discernible in the historical record was perhaps in play.

40|$|Draft: {{please do}} not cite without {{permission}} of the author] Growing democratization and the waning influence of the Washington Consensus in developing countries have opened new spaces for an unprecedented consideration of heterodox alternatives.

Starting from the insight that democratic deliberation is becoming a coveted and crucial element of development policy, this paper explores the role of participatory processes in Central America in economic and social policy.
