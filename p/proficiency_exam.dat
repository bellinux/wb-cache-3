Gun licenses may be obtained in a way very similar to a driving license – by passing a gun <b>proficiency</b> <b>exam,</b> medical examination and having a clean criminal record. Unlike in most other European countries, the Czech gun legislation also permits a citizen to carry a concealed weapon for self-defense – 240,000 out of some 300,000 legal gun owners have concealed carry permit. The vast majority of Czech gun owners possess their firearms for protection, with hunting and sport shooting being less common.|$|E

500|$|Glenn {{attended}} New Concord High School, {{where he}} played on the varsity football team as a center and linebacker. He also made the varsity basketball and tennis teams, and was involved with Hi-Y, a junior branch of the YMCA. After graduating in 1939, Glenn entered Muskingum College, where he studied engineering, and Annie majored in music, with minors in secretarial studies and physical education, as {{she was on the}} swimming and volleyball teams. Glenn {{was a member of the}} Stag Club fraternity there, and played on the football team. He earned a private pilot license under the Civilian Pilot Training Program in 1941, gaining credit in his physics course, since the course included aerodynamics, combustion and heat transfer. He did not complete his senior year in residence or take a <b>proficiency</b> <b>exam,</b> both required by the school for its Bachelor of Science degree. Muskingum awarded his degree in 1962, after Glenn's Mercury space flight. Glenn married Annie in a Presbyterian ceremony at College Drive Church in Columbus, Ohio, on April 6, 1943. [...] They had two children—John David and Carolyn Ann—and two grandchildren, and remained married for 73 years until his death. Glenn's NASA friend Charles Bolden was inspired by the marriage.|$|E
500|$|Boyle's time as Education Minister was tumultuous: many {{teachers}} enlisted {{to fight in}} World War I, and many others left the profession for more lucrative opportunities elsewhere. [...] In its members' handbook, the Alberta Teachers' Association describes Boyle's efforts to remedy this situation as [...] "heroic", citing in particular his convincing the legislature to set a minimum teachers' salary of $840 per year. [...] Another of Boyle's tactics to alleviate the teacher shortage was {{to make it easier}} for teachers qualified in Quebec to teach in Alberta. [...] However, this liberalization was subject to applicants' English proficiency: Boyle insisted that all instruction in Alberta schools be delivered in English. [...] A Québécois teacher who passed an English language <b>proficiency</b> <b>exam</b> would be granted a temporary teaching license, which could be upgraded to a full Alberta Teaching Certificate with five months' study at a normal school. [...] Boyle's insistence that Alberta was English offended not only the province's French Canadian minority, but also its Ukrainian-speaking population; an editorial in a Ukrainian newspaper maintained angrily that [...] "the minister of education lies when he says that Alberta is an English province. [...] Alberta is a Canadian province, where everyone has equal rights, including the Ukrainians." [...] During a by-election in Whitford Boyle accused the Conservatives of promising Ukrainian language schools to court the immigrant vote.|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to providing support for the content validity, Sims and Liu (2013) also reported {{a strong correlation between}} the EPE and the High-Intermediate General English Proficiency Test (GEPT). The GEPT is designed on the criteria the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), while EPE was not specially designed on this framework. However, both the GEPT and EPE are “general” <b>proficiency</b> <b>exams.</b> It is worthy to note that in a correlation study between the EPE and the Intermediate GEPT, 158 out of 165 students (95.8  %) who scored 60 points or higher on the EPE passed the first stage (listening and reading) of the Intermediate GEPT. According to the LTTC website, the first stage of the Intermediate GEPT corresponds to the B 1 level of the CEFR. This suggests that students who score 60 and above on the EPE may be at least at the B 1 level of the CEFR for listening and reading. Also, since both <b>exams</b> are “general” <b>proficiency</b> <b>exams,</b> the strong correlation to the GEPT suggests that the EPE may have concurrent validity {{similar to that of the}} GEPT.|$|R
