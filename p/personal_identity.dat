5|$|Nolan's {{films are}} rooted in {{epistemological}} and metaphysical themes, exploring human morality, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and <b>personal</b> <b>identity.</b> His body of work is permeated by materialistic perspectives, nonlinear storytelling, practical special effects, innovative soundscapes, large-format film photography, and analogous relationships between visual language and narrative elements. In addition to his filmmaking, he is a vocal advocate for film preservation and the continued availability of film stock.|$|E
5|$|Several {{commentators}} {{have noted that}} <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> is a strong theme in the book, and that it addresses issues of racism through the treatment of non-magical, non-human and non-living characters. Some commentators regard the diary as a warning against uncritical acceptance of information from sources whose motives and reliability cannot be checked. Institutional authority is portrayed as self-serving and incompetent. The book is also known to have some connections to the sixth novel of the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} that Edward {{had a sexual}} relationship with Gaveston or his later favourites has been extensively discussed by historians, complicated by the paucity of surviving evidence to determine for certain the details of their relationships. Homosexuality was fiercely condemned by the Church in 14th-century England, which equated it with heresy, but engaging in sex with another man did not necessarily define an individual's <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> {{in the same way that}} it might in the 21st century. Edward and Gaveston both had sexual relationships with their wives, who bore them children; Edward also had an illegitimate son, and may also have had an affair with his niece, Eleanor de Clare.|$|E

5|$|The {{strength}} of an interest {{is determined by}} {{a consideration of the}} value of something to an individual (though this is not understood purely subjectively) and the relationship between the individual at this time and the individual when he or she has the interest satisfied (see <b>personal</b> <b>identity).</b> Cochrane argues that those beings who lack personhood, including many nonhuman animals and some humans, do not have an interest in liberty or not being used by others, and so have no prima facie right to freedom. They do, however, possess significant interests in not being made to suffer and in not being killed, and so have a prima facie right not to be made to suffer and a prima facie right not to be killed.|$|E
5|$|According to Daniel Joseph Singal, Faulkner's {{literary}} style gradually {{developed from}} 19th century Victorian to modernist, with Light in August more firmly {{grounded in the}} tradition of the latter. The novel is characteristic of the modernist fascination with polaritieslight and dark, good and evilthe burden of history on the present, and the splintering of <b>personal</b> <b>identity.</b> The plot is also divided into dual currents, one focusing on Lena Grove and the other on Joe Christmas, a technique that Faulkner continued to use in other works. The narrative is not structured in any particular order, as it is often interrupted by lengthy flashbacks and constantly shifts from one character to another. This lack of organization and narrative continuity was viewed negatively by some critics. As in his other novels, Faulkner employs elements of oral storytelling, allowing different characters to lend voice to the narrative in their own distinct Southern idiom. Unlike some of the other Yoknapatawpha County novels, notably The Sound and the Fury, Light in August does not rely solely on stream-of-consciousness narration, but also incorporates dialogue and an omniscient third-person narrator that develop the story.|$|E

Žirmūnai is {{the location of}} the <b>Personal</b> <b>Identity</b> Documents Centre of Lithuania's Ministry of the Interior which produces all of Lithuania's identity cards, passports, and driver's licenses, as well as residency permits. Issuance of residence permits is controlled by Vilnius City Migration Service, which is housed in Žirmūnai too. The State Tax Inspectorate has an office in Šiaurės Miestelis, providing services to private as well as legal persons. There are also several medicine-related institutions, such as the Ministry of Health's State Public Health Service, the Vilnius city morgue. The Institute of Forensic Medicine of the Mykolas Romeris University was headquartered in Šiaurės Miestelis as well. The Lithuanian National Olympic Committee, the Vilnius Department of the Lithuanian Labour Exchange at the Ministry of Social Security and Labour, the Honorary Vice-Consulate of the Kingdom of Spain, and the National Examination Center, established by the Ministry of Education to organize centralized nationwide examinations of high school graduates, all have headquarters in Žirmūnai.|$|E

50|$|Axioms {{one through}} five all relate to our views of ourselves, or self-concepts.

They both act {{in such a way as}} to help us manage uncertainty and anxiety by sufficiently predicting behavior. If either of these identities feels threatened, Gudykunst believes that we will attempt to raise collective self-esteem and hence fostering a more positive outcome. The greater our self-esteem, the better we are able to manage our anxiety.|$|R

This paper addresses the problem of women's multiple collective identities by arguing that Sen's capability framework offers a means of explaining how women can maintain coherent <b>personal</b> <b>identities.</b> Using Sen's real opportunities sense of capabilities, the paper argues that women can acquire <b>personal</b> <b>identities</b> apart from their multiple collective identities if they acquire the specific capability of being able, freely and successfully, to negotiate their multiple group involvements.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{influence}} of racism on formation and perception of <b>personal</b> <b>identities</b> of African Americans in the novel Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison. Whether racism is a restriction for forming the <b>personal</b> <b>identities</b> of African Americans or an obstacle for the society to truly perceive the identities of those individuals, will be evaluated. Ellison’s perception of literature was that it was a powerful weapon to eliminate the corruption of society. In other words he used literature as a “moral instrument”. His use of symbols and motifs conveys ideologies and facilitates the understanding of his ideas comprehensively enabling him to turn literature into a moral instrument. The symbols used such as Liberty Paint, Sambo Doll, Coin Bank and the undisclosed name of the narrator and motifs such as blindness and invisibility are seen as the most significant tools that the author used to convey his ideas. Each of them is analyzed regarding their direct and indirect effects on <b>personal</b> <b>identities</b> of African American people thoroughly. After this analysis, a conclusion about the thesis is reached and presented in this essay...|$|R

25|$|Past {{literature}} has suggested psychogenic amnesia can be 'situation-specific' or 'global-transient', the former referring to memory loss {{for a particular}} incident, and the latter relating to large retrograde amnesic gaps of up to many years in <b>personal</b> <b>identity.</b> The most commonly cited examples of global-transient psychogenic amnesia are 'fugue states', of {{which there is a}} sudden retrograde loss of autobiographical memory resulting in impairment of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> and usually accompanied by a period of wandering. Suspected cases of psychogenic amnesia have been heavily reported throughout the literature since 1935 where it was reported by Abeles and Schilder. There are many clinical anecdotes of psychogenic or dissociative amnesia attributed to stressor ranging from cases of child sexual abuse to soldiers returning from combat.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comparative}} study of Roman Polanski 1976 pyschological thriller The Tenant and Max Frisch’s 1954 novel Stiller. It explores the multi-layered and multivalent nature of the director’s film and the author’s novel by analyzing them through various theoretical lenses. While focusing on the (re) construction and destruction of the protagonists’ identities, it unfolds the multiple levels of meaning pertinent to various literary and cinematic motifs, including the double, suicide, projection, and fiction making. The first chapter explores {{the dynamics of the}} conflict between the societal and <b>personal</b> <b>identities</b> of the protagonists. The second chapter highlights the defense mechanisms- i. e. doubling and projection- the protagonists adopt against the external assaults on their <b>personal</b> <b>identities.</b> The third chapter elaborates on the failure of the defense mechanisms and the ambiguities of the protagonists’ final states...|$|R
