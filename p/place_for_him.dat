5|$|After these revelations, {{the people}} of Springfield begin to {{distrust}} Armin. Armin decides {{that there is no}} longer any <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> in Springfield. The real Skinner is then offered the chance to realize his dream and take over as school principal. He takes the job, but the real Skinner finds himself isolated by the townspeople who realize they prefer Armin over him. Armin, however, has already left Springfield and gone to Capital City to resume his old persona as a no-good street thug.|$|E
5|$|Jerry {{knows what}} the {{situation}} is. I think he's done very well for us, considering we plucked him out of non-league football at Yeovil. But he is aware that I {{have been looking for}} a right-back and I will continue looking for one. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> here.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, Harvey {{was facing}} serious setbacks. Harvey's son Hal {{had died in}} 1903 and was interred in a {{mausoleum}} in Monte Ne. His other son, Tom, had left in 1908 never to return. The next decade would not bring better news for Harvey either. Harvey and his wife, Anna, were now permanently estranged after 25 years of marriage. Harvey's close friend William Jennings Bryan failed to find a <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> in the new Woodrow Wilson administration. Harvey's 1913 bid for the Third Congressional District of Arkansas also failed. His Monte Ne was also failing. The railway had been sold and would be scrapped after World War I. The Bank of Monte Ne had also gone out of business. Faced with these severe dilemmas, Harvey had begun reasoning {{that the end of}} civilization was at hand. In February 1920, he published Common Sense, in which Harvey announced his intention to leave a message for the future {{in the form of a}} pyramid.|$|E

5|$|Hurt by Whatsername's departure, Johnny {{longs for}} better days ahead, Tunny longs for home, and Will longs {{for all the}} things he's lost ("Wake Me Up When September Ends"). St. Jimmy appears and makes one last attempt to get Johnny's attention, but that part of Johnny has died, {{resulting}} in the metaphorical suicide of St. Jimmy ("The Death of St. Jimmy"). Johnny cleans up and gets a desk job but soon realizes there is no <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> in the city ("East 12th Street"). Will, all alone with his television, bemoans his outcast state ("Nobody Likes You"). As he finally gets up off the couch, Heather appears with her new show-off rockstar boyfriend ("Rock and Roll Girlfriend"). Will heads to the 7-Eleven {{to get away from}} them and, surprisingly, finds Johnny there. Johnny had sold his guitar for a bus ticket home. Tunny returns from the war zone (as an amputee) with the Extraordinary Girl. As Tunny introduces his friends to the Extraordinary Girl, Johnny becomes furious with him for leaving the group, but quickly forgives him and the three friends embrace. Heather and her boyfriend arrive. In an uneasy truce, she gives the baby to Will. Other friends show up to greet the three men they haven't seen in a year ("We're Coming Home Again"). One year later, Johnny laments that he lost the love of his life, but he accepts that he can live inside the struggle between rage and love that has defined his life. With this acceptance comes the possibility of hope ("Whatsername").|$|E

25|$|In 1948 Burton {{moved to}} London {{to make contact}} with H. M. Tennent Ltd., where he again met Beaumont, who put him under a {{contract}} of £500 per year (£10 a week). Daphne Rye, the casting director for H. M. Tennent Ltd., offered Burton two rooms {{on the top floor of}} her house in Pelham Crescent, London as a <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to stay. Rye cast Burton in a minor role as a young officer, Mr. Hicks, in Castle Anna (1948), a drama set in Ireland.|$|E

25|$|Raina was {{selected}} for the England tour in July. There {{was a lot of}} debate on who should play the first Test at Lord's, Yuvraj or Raina. But a century in a practice match against Somerset sealed a <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> in the playing eleven. Apart from a half-century in the first Test at Lord's, Raina managed just 27runs from seven innings. He struggled against short bowling and in the final Test was out for a 29-ball duck, the longest in India's Test history.|$|E
25|$|MacKaye {{recruited}} ex-Dag Nasty drummer Colin Sears {{and bass}} guitarist Joe Lally, and the trio began practicing together in September 1986. After {{a few months}} of rehearsals, Sears returned to Dag Nasty and was replaced by Brendan Canty (earlier of Rites of Spring). One day Canty's Rites of Spring bandmate Guy Picciotto dropped by during a practice session to see how his friend was getting along; he later admitted he secretly harbored the idea of joining the group. But Picciotto was disappointed that {{there seemed to be no}} <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|Celtic {{struggled}} in the 1977–78 season and Stein was persuaded to stand down. He {{was allowed to}} nominate his successor, Billy McNeill, and Stein thought an agreement was in <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to join the Celtic board of directors. Celtic instead offered a management position in their pools company, which Stein rejected as he believed he still had something to offer football. A testimonial match for Stein was played against Liverpool at Celtic Park on 14 August 1978. After the game, the Liverpool manager Bob Paisley encouraged Stein, who was three years younger than Paisley, to stay in football. There was also the example of Bill Shankly, who had experienced an unhappy retirement since leaving Liverpool in 1974.|$|E
6000|$|He {{just turned}} {{and kissed her}} when she took off his mantle; then he went towards a high-backed chair <b>placed</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> near the fire, threw himself into it, and flung away his cap, saying, not peevishly, but in a {{fatigued}} tone of remonstrance, as he gave a slight shudder-- ...|$|R

25|$|In 1822, Ripley was {{a town of}} {{frequent}} street fights and shootouts where {{the most common type}} of business was a saloon. During the Rankins' first few months there, hecklers and protesters often followed the new preacher through town and gathered outside his cabin while their first permanent home was being built just yards from the river at 220 Front Street. When the local newspaper began publishing his letters to his brother on the topic of slavery (see next section), Rankin's reputation grew among both supporters and opponents of the anti-slavery movement. Slave owners and hunters often viewed him as their prime suspect and appeared at his door at all hours demanding information about fugitives. Soon, Rankin realized that the home was too accessible a <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to properly raise his family.|$|E
25|$|The play proper resumes with Saul (the play {{does not}} include his {{renaming}} as Paul), now dressed as a disciple of Jesus, delivering to the audience a rather lengthy sermon on the Seven Deadly Sins. Saul is taken to Caypha and Anna, who order {{the gates of the}} city to be locked that they might kill him shortly. However, an angel appears and tells Saul that he will not die yet, and that a <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> in heaven is assured. Saul's escape from the city in a basket is described, not staged. The play ends with Poeta inviting the audience to sing the hymn Exultet caelum laudibus. While Scherb praises the swift ending and finds its reliance on words rather than images appropriate to the play's thematic focus on faith and the movement from iconography to rhetoric, Coldewey simply finds it abrupt.|$|E
25|$|At {{a meeting}} of the Jockey Club in 1882, Byng's father was asked about his sons by his long-time friend, Albert Edward, Prince of Wales. Upon hearing that Byng had not yet found a {{permanent}} career, the Prince offered a <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> in his own regiment, the 10th Royal Hussars. This was the most expensive regiment in the army, and the Earl of Strafford could only afford to give Byng two hundred of the six hundred pounds he would need each year, but the Prince's offer could not be refused. Byng himself was delighted at the opportunity, as both his uncle, Lord Chesham, and his cousin, Charles Cavendish, had served in the regiment. By raising money through buying polo ponies cheaply, using his excellent horsemanship to train them, and then selling them on at a profit, Byng was able to transfer to the 10th Royal Hussars on 27 January 1883, and less than three months later he joined the regiment in Lucknow, India.|$|E
50|$|The {{trail was}} {{inspired}} by Stephen Talkhouse, a 19th-century Montaukett Indian famed for his 25-30 mile roundtrip walks from Montauk to East Hampton, New York and Sag Harbor, New York.

500|$|Soon thereafter, Butcher {{once again}} {{decided that the}} West was the <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "I had just seen enough of the wild west to unfit me for living contentedly in the East", he wrote.

[...] After watching Maulbetsch dominate Michigan's freshman team, Yost concluded: [...] "If I could get that kid into Michigan and keep him up in his studies I’d make an All-American <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> his first year." [...] Yost persuaded Maulbetsch to transfer, and he played with [...] "the scrubs" [...] in 1912.

500|$|In 2011, the U.S. {{placed a}} plaque at Robinson's Montreal home {{to honor the}} ending of {{segregation}} in baseball. The house, on 8232 avenue de Gaspé near Jarry Park, was Robinson's residence when he played for the Montreal Royals during 1946. In a letter read during the ceremony, Rachel Robinson, Jackie's widow, wrote: [...] "I remember Montreal and that house very well and have always had warm feeling for that great city. Before Jack and I moved to Montreal, we had just been through some very rough treatment in the racially biased South during spring training in Florida. In the end, Montreal was the perfect <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to get his start. We never had a threatening or unpleasant experience there.

60|$|Herr Freudenberg {{was dressed}} for the evening with his usual fastidious neatness. He had {{the air of a}} man who had been engaged for many nights in some arduous occupation. There were dark rims under his eyes, the lines upon his {{forehead}} were deeper.

6000|$|... ‘Thank you.

500|$|Somerset {{experimented with}} Kieswetter {{throughout}} the order, {{trying to find}} the most effective <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> He began as a middle-order batsman, {{but by the end of}} the 2007 season, although he remained in the middle-order in first-class cricket, Kieswetter regularly found himself opening the batting alongside Marcus Trescothick in one-day cricket, a role he would also take up in opening six matches of the 2009 Twenty20 Cup, although he later dropped back into the middle order to improve the balance of the side. On his international call-up, England chose to use Kieswetter as an opening batsman. He was selected [...] "because of his proven ability to pierce the field in the Powerplay overs, particularly with his booming drives up and over the covers." [...] He later moved down the order for England to accommodate Kevin Pietersen as opener.|$|E
500|$|Earning a small wage, Mandela {{rented a}} room in the house of the Xhoma family in the Alexandra township; despite being rife with poverty, crime and pollution, Alexandra always {{remained}} a special <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Although embarrassed by his poverty, he briefly dated a Swazi woman before unsuccessfully courting his landlord's daughter. To save money and be closer to downtown Johannesburg, Mandela moved into the compound of the Witwatersrand Native Labour Association, living among miners of various tribes; as the compound was visited by various chiefs, he once met the Queen Regent of Basutoland. In late 1941, Jongintaba visited Johannesburg—there forgiving Mandela for running away—before returning to Thembuland, where he died in the winter of 1942. Mandela and Justice arrived a day late for the funeral. After he passed his BA exams in early 1943, Mandela returned to Johannesburg to follow a political path as a lawyer rather than become a privy councillor in Thembuland. He later stated that he experienced no epiphany, but that he [...] "simply found [...] doing so, and could not do otherwise." ...|$|E
500|$|Poniewozik {{notes that}} [...] "It also remains {{a delight to}} watch Spacey pump the humid breath of life into House of Cards’ arid Capitol chill. If only his {{character}} weren’t so dominant of his surroundings as well. One reason the series’ movements can feel so mechanical is that, so far, no one seems nearly in Underwood’s league: not the adversaries he battles directly, nor the sad sacks that he gulls without their even knowing it." [...] Chuck Barney of the San Jose Mercury News notes that the preview episodes show that [...] "Frank's [...] "Survivor"-like back-stabbing is beginning to feel a bit repetitive." [...] and that his lack of an adversarial foil has become an issue: [...] "...things always seem to fall neatly into <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Even his showdowns with the president (Michel Gill) come off as one-sided..." [...] Verne Gay of Newsday notes that [...] "Frank Underwood has no remorse, no superannuated sense of Washington tradition or decorum, and certainly no second thoughts. He is TV's perfect monster of the moment - a compleat malefactor, with a pleasing honey-toned drawl." ...|$|E
