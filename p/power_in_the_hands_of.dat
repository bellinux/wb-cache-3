5|$|Led by Enver Pasha, a coup in Turkey in 1913 sidelined Sultan Mehmed V and {{concentrated}} <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> a junta. Despite the secular {{nature of the}} new government, Turkey retained its traditional influence over the Muslim world. Turkey ruled Hejaz until the Arab Revolt of 1916 and controlled the Muslim holy city of Mecca throughout the war. The Sultan's title of Caliph was recognised as legitimate by most Muslims, including those in Afghanistan and India.|$|E
5|$|Acting on {{recommendations}} from Beckham's commission, legislators helped offset the lost {{revenue from the}} sales tax by raising excise taxes; of particular import was the tax on whiskey, which {{was made possible by}} the repeal of Prohibition in 1935. Legislators also enacted the state's first income tax during the session. Chandler further proposed to achieve savings through the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1936. The bill realized significant cost savings by restructuring the state government, reducing the number of boards and commissions in the executive branch from 133 to 22. Critics pointed out that the act also centralized more <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> the governor and accused Chandler of ulterior motives in supporting it.|$|E
5|$|The report {{published}} by the Tower Commission was delivered to the president on February 26, 1987. The Commission had interviewed 80 witnesses to the scheme, including Reagan, {{and two of the}} arms trade middlemen: Manucher Ghorbanifar and Adnan Khashoggi. The 200-page report was the most comprehensive of any released, criticizing the actions of Oliver North, John Poindexter, Caspar Weinberger, and others. It determined that President Reagan did not have knowledge of the extent of the program, especially about the diversion of funds to the Contras, although it argued that the president ought to have had better control of the National Security Council staff. The report heavily criticized Reagan for not properly supervising his subordinates or being aware of their actions. A major result of the Tower Commission was the consensus that Reagan should have listened to his National Security Advisor more, thereby placing more <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> that chair.|$|E
50|$|Two dangers {{face the}} Land: the {{constant}} {{threat of the}} intention of Lord Foul, although his purposes appear more benign than before; and <b>the</b> presence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Land of white gold (an ultimate source of <b>power)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> of one turned mad, Joan Covenant (Thomas's ex-wife).|$|R
5000|$|During <b>the</b> {{constitutional}} referendum <b>in</b> 2011, she called on her political {{movement and the}} Democratic Left Alliance for a boycott, saying that the constitution was not democratic given that it maintains most of <b>the</b> <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> of <b>the</b> sovereign and does not assure a real separation of powers.|$|R
5000|$|Jiang Ji {{was one of}} {{the main}} {{participants}} of the coup at the Sima Yi's side. Jiang Ji sent a letter to Cao Shuang and said that [...] "Sima Yi and Jiang Ji were concerned solely with <b>the</b> military <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> of Cao Shuang and Cao Shuang's brothers, as Sima Yi had sworn pointing to River Luo." ...|$|R
5|$|Richard's {{approach}} to kingship {{was rooted in}} his strong belief in the royal prerogative, the inspiration {{of which can be}} found in his early youth, when his authority was challenged first by the Peasants' Revolts and then by the Lords Appellant. Richard rejected the approach his grandfather, Edward III, had taken to the nobility. Edward's court had been a martial one, based on the interdependence between the king and his most trusted noblemen as military captains. In Richard's view, this put a dangerous amount of <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> the baronage. To avoid dependence on the nobility for military recruitment, he pursued a policy of peace towards France. At the same time, he developed his own private military retinue, larger than that of any English king before him, and gave them livery badges with his White Hart, which are also worn by the angels in the Wilton Diptych (right). He was then free to develop a courtly atmosphere in which the king was a distant, venerated figure, and art and culture, rather than warfare, were at the centre.|$|E
25|$|The county {{began with}} most {{legislative}} <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> the Maryland state government, with a five-person Montgomery County Board of Commissioners {{who oversaw the}} administration of the county but could neither pass county laws nor enact policies.|$|E
25|$|Not all of Mara's {{critics were}} Indo-Fijian. George Speight, a {{commoner}} (i.e., one of non-chiefly ancestry) {{who led the}} 2000 putsch accused Mara of selling the country out to Indo-Fijians, and of working to keep <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> a coalition of Fijian chiefs and Indo-Fijian businessmen, {{at the expense of}} Fijian commoners.|$|E
5000|$|Járnsíða ( [...] , ironside) was a law-code which Magnus VI of Norway had {{composed}} for Iceland, {{which came}} formally under Norwegian control during 1262-1264. Járnsíða was introduced over 1271-1274, superseding the previous law-code Grágás. Amongst other things, Járnsíða formally put all legislative <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> of <b>the</b> King, abolished the goðar, and reformed <b>the</b> Alþingi. <b>In</b> 1281, Járnsíða was itself superseded by Jónsbók.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{states have}} granted {{some form of}} home rule, so that county {{commissions}} (or boards or councils) have <b>the</b> same <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> these areas as city councils or town councils have in their respective incorporated areas. Some states instead put these <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> of townships, which are minor civil divisions of each county, and are called [...] "towns" [...] in some states.|$|R

25|$|In 1940, Lithuania was {{occupied}} by the Soviet Union. Ironically, the constitution of 1938 assisted the Soviets in legitimizing their actions by concentrating the <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> the President, the post that was de facto taken over by Justas Paleckis. In 1940 and 1978, new constitutions of Lithuanian SSR were adopted, based on the Soviet constitutions of 1936 and 1977, respectively.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1920s the Yugoslav {{government}} of Serbian prime minister Nikola Pašić used police pressure over voters and ethnic minorities, confiscation of opposition pamphlets {{and other measures}} of election rigging to keep the opposition, and mainly the Croatian Peasant Party and its allies in minority in Yugoslav parliament. Pašić believed that Yugoslavia should be as centralized as possible, creating in place of distinct regional governments and identities a Greater Serbian national concept of concentrated <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> Belgrade.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1990s, many plans were {{proposed}} to limit or discourage economic practices that damage the environment. Despite discussion of programs to require payments for resources (especially water) and to collect fines from heavy polluters, however, little has been accomplished. The obstacles are a lack of law enforcement in these areas, inconsistent government economic and environmental planning, corruption, and the overwhelming concentration of <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> a president who shows little tolerance of grassroots activity.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{executive}} <b>power</b> is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> of <b>the</b> {{president and}} the vice-president, [...] "both to be provisionally appointed by the present congress".|$|R

5000|$|Louis {{returned}} to Vienne, his capital, and by 911, {{he had put}} most of <b>the</b> royal <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> of Hugh. Hugh was made Margrave of Provence and Marquis of Vienne and moved the capital to Arles. As regent, Hugh married Louis's sister Willa. Louis lived out his days {{until his death in}} obscurity, and to his dying day, he still continued to style himself as Roman Emperor. [...] He was succeeded by his brother-in-law in 928.|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the {{construction}} industry was in transition, and this transition led to large, frequent jurisdictional conflicts between labor unions. Proliferation in new building techniques and materials led {{to an increase in}} specialized construction professions, which in turn led to the establishment of numerous small specialty unions and fights over which union's members would perform the work. The nature of {{the construction industry}} at the time also concentrated <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> local rather than regional or international unions.|$|E
25|$|In 1940, Robinson {{became the}} first chief of the Bureau of Ships (BuShips), a new {{division}} formed by consolidating the Bureau of Engineering with the Bureau of Construction and Repair. The merger {{was the brainchild of}} Secretary of the Navy Charles Edison, who wanted centralized control of shipbuilding but had failed in a previous effort to create a chief of shore operations, which the sea-going admirals had resisted as placing excessive responsibility and <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> a mere technical officer.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-14th {{century the}} {{authority}} of the Chagatai khans underwent a sudden decline. In {{the western part of the}} khanate (specifically Transoxiana and the bordering provinces), the khans had become rulers in name only, with real <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> the local Turko-Mongol amirs after 1346. In the eastern provinces (spec. the Tarim Basin and the area that was to become Moghulistan) {{the authority of}} the khans in Transoxiana was virtually nonexistent. As a result, power there was in the hands of the local lords and tribal chiefs.|$|E

50|$|The Liberal-Conservative Junta (Triunvirato de Gobierno or Government Triumvirate) officially ruled Nicaragua between 1972 and 1974, though {{effective}} <b>power</b> was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> of strongman Anastasio Somoza.|$|R
50|$|Since Minamoto no Yoritomo {{launched}} the shogunate, true <b>power</b> was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> of <b>the</b> Shoguns, who were mistaken several {{times for the}} Emperors of Japan by western countries.|$|R
25|$|After {{independence}} also {{he continued}} his struggle for transfer of power to the common man. His vision was that the Panchayat Raj was the only tool which can put real <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> people and reduce corruption and bureaucratic hurdles. He {{was the president of}} Indian Freedom Fighters' Association and was also the president of All India Jat Mahasabha. He {{was a member of the}} second Lok Sabha in 1957–1962. He was elected as an independent candidate from Mathura constituency defeating Bharatiya Jana Sangh (which would later evolved into BJP) candidate and the future Prime Minister of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the 1957 Lok Sabha Elections.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt had {{attempted}} to refashion Taft into a younger version of himself, {{but as soon as}} Taft began to display his individuality, the former president expressed his disenchantment. He was offended on election night when Taft indicated that his success had been possible not just through the efforts of Roosevelt, but also his brother Charley. Roosevelt was further alienated when Taft, intent on becoming his own man, did not consult him about cabinet appointments. Roosevelt and other progressives were also dissatisfied over Taft's conservation policies and his handling of the tariff, which had indirectly concentrated more <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> conservative party leaders in Congress.|$|E
25|$|In 1792–93 {{he succeeded}} in {{carrying}} a Roman Catholic Relief Act conferring the franchise on Catholics; in 1794 in conjunction with William Ponsonby, he introduced a reform bill which was even milder than Flood's bill of 1783. He was as anxious as Flood had been to retain the legislative <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> men of property. Grattan had a strong conviction that while Ireland could best be governed by the Irish, democracy in Ireland would inevitably turn to plunder and anarchy. At {{the same time he}} wished to open membership of the House of Commons to Catholic men of property, a proposal that was the logical corollary of the Relief Act of 1793.|$|E
50|$|From 63 - 40 BCE, <b>the</b> {{government}} was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> of Hyrcanus II as High Priest and Ethnarch, although effective <b>power</b> was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> of his adviser Antipater the Idumaean.|$|R

50|$|The Junta of National Reconstruction (Junta de Gobierno de Reconstrucción Nacional) officially ruled Nicaragua from July 1979 to January 1985. Effective <b>power</b> was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> of <b>the</b> Sandinista National Liberation Front's National Directorate.|$|R
25|$|Domestically, Senusret {{has been}} given credit for an {{administrative}} reform which put more <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> appointees of the central government, instead of regional authorities. Egypt was divided into three waret, or administrative divisions: North, South, and Head of the South (perhaps Lower Egypt, most of Upper Egypt, and the nomes of the original Theban kingdom during the war with Herakleopolis, respectively). Each region was administrated by a Reporter, Second Reporter, some kind of council (the Djadjat), and a staff of minor officials and scribes. The power of the Nomarchs seems to drop off permanently during his reign, which has been taken {{to indicate that the}} central government had finally suppressed them, though there is no record that Senusret ever took direct action against them.|$|E
25|$|A tax {{called the}} undistributed profits tax was enacted in 1936. This time {{the primary purpose}} was revenue, since Congress had enacted the Adjusted Compensation Payment Act, calling for {{payments}} of $2billion to World War I veterans. The bill established the persisting principle that retained corporate earnings could be taxed. Paid dividends were tax deductible by corporations. Its proponents intended the bill to replace all other corporation taxes—believing this would stimulate corporations to distribute earnings and thus put more cash and spending <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> individuals. In the end, Congress watered down the bill, setting the tax rates at 7 to 27% and largely exempting small enterprises. Facing widespread and fierce criticism, the tax deduction of paid dividends was repealed in 1938.|$|E
25|$|From 1612 onwards, and {{certainly}} by 1617, the Lerma administration was crumbling. The monopoly of <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> the Lerma's Sandoval family had generated numerous enemies; Lerma's personal enrichment in office {{had become a}} scandal; Lerma's extravagant spending and personal debts was beginning to alarm his own son, Cristóbal de Sandoval, Duke of Uceda; lastly, ten years of quiet diplomacy by Fathers Luis de Aliaga, Philip's confessor, and Juan de Santa Maria, Philip's daughter's confessor and a former client of Queen Margaret, had begun to apply personal and religious pressure on the king to alter his method of government. Philip remained close to Lerma, however, and supported him in becoming a cardinal in March 1618 under Pope Paul V, a position which would offer Lerma some protection as his government collapsed.|$|E
50|$|He {{began his}} reign during a very {{critical}} period <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{history of the}} Latin Empire of Constantinople, because {{the fall of the}} Kingdom of Thessalonica in 1224 had interposed formidable enemies between the capital of the empire on <b>the</b> one <b>hand</b> and <b>the</b> crusaders’ states <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Peloponnese on the other. But the defeat of Emperor Theodore Komnenos Doukas of Thessalonica (c. 1225-1230) by Tzar John Asen II of Bulgaria (1218-1241) at Klokotnitza in April, 1230 freed them from <b>the</b> dangers inherent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> great concentration of <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> of Theodore Komnenos Doukas.|$|R
