5|$|His {{expedition}} completed after a {{total of}} 17 months, Beebe and Blair crossed the Pacific to San Francisco, then crossed the United States {{to return to their}} home in New York. Their expedition had obtained live or stuffed specimens of nearly all the <b>pheasants</b> he had sought, and also produced extensive notes about their behavior. Some of these <b>pheasants,</b> such as Sclater's impeyan or Himalayan monal, had never before been seen in the wild by Americans or Europeans. Beebe's observations of sexual dimorphism in <b>pheasants</b> during this expedition led him to become the first biologist to correctly understand the mechanism by which this aspect of sexual selection operates. On the basis of his observations he also proposed a new evolutionary model of pheasant ancestry, involving a period of rapid diversification followed by more typical and gradual changes. Although this evolutionary model is now taken for granted, in William Beebe's time it was a novel idea.|$|E
5|$|Other notable {{bird species}} in the zoo's {{collection}} include Darwin's rhea, Chilean flamingos, Egyptian vultures, eastern white pelicans, scarlet ibis, waldrapp ibis, great argus <b>pheasants,</b> ocellated turkeys, red-fronted macaws, rainbow lorikeets, hamerkop, and southern cassowary.|$|E
50|$|The silver <b>pheasant</b> {{is closely}} related to the kalij <b>pheasant</b> and the two are known to hybridize. The {{placement}} of the taxa lineata and crawfurdi has been a matter of dispute, with some treating them as subspecies of the kalij <b>pheasant</b> and others as subspecies of the silver <b>pheasant.</b> They have greyish legs as in the kalij <b>pheasant,</b> but their plumage is closer to that of some subspecies of the silver <b>pheasant.</b> Additionally, as the silver <b>pheasant,</b> lineata and crawfurdi are found east of the Irrawaddy River, a major zoogeographic barrier, while all other subspecies of the kalij <b>pheasant</b> are found west of the river (oatesi, a subspecies of the kalij <b>pheasant,</b> has sometimes been reported as occurring east of that river, but this is incorrect). Based on mtDNA, it was recently confirmed that lineata and crawfurdi should be regarded as subspecies of the kalij <b>pheasant.</b>|$|R

5|$|Born in Brooklyn, New York {{and raised}} in East Orange, New Jersey, Beebe left college before obtaining a degree {{in order to work}} at the then newly opened New York Zoological Park, where he was given the duty of caring for the zoo's birds. He quickly {{distinguished}} himself in his work for the zoo, first with his skill in designing habitats for its bird population, and soon also with a series of research expeditions of increasing length, including an expedition around the world to document the world's <b>pheasants.</b> These expeditions formed the basis for a large quantity of writing for both popular and academic audiences, including an account of his pheasant expedition titled A Monograph of the <b>Pheasants</b> and published in four volumes from 1918 to 1922. In recognition of the research conducted on his expeditions, he was granted honorary doctorates from Tufts and Colgate University.|$|E

5|$|The {{imperial}} <b>pheasant</b> {{is a rare}} bird {{found in}} the forests of Vietnam and Laos.

5|$|Shortly after Beebe's {{return from}} this expedition, Anthony Kuser {{requested}} that Beebe produce a condensed, popular {{version of his}} pheasant monograph. The book which resulted from this, titled Pheasants: their Lives and Homes (also known by the title <b>Pheasants</b> of the World), was released in 1926 and received the John Burroughs Medal. During the course of writing this book, Beebe was reminded of many experiences during the pheasant expedition which he had not included in his original monograph, and wrote an additional book titled Pheasant Jungles about his adventures during this expedition. While A Monograph of the <b>Pheasants</b> had been a factual account of this expedition, Pheasant Jungles was a somewhat fictionalized account, in which Beebe altered some aspects of his experience in order {{to appeal to a}} wider audience.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} game birds in the United States is the ring-necked <b>pheasant</b> (Phasianus colchicus). This Asian refugee has provided recreation for untold numbers of sportsmen. Its presence has meant millions of dollars for state game agency coffers, not to mention its impact on local economies. <b>Pheasant</b> populations have fluctuated widely in past years, but the overall trend since the early 19602 Ì† 7 s has been downward over most of the <b>pheasant</b> range. This decline was caused primarily by loss of habitat due to change in agricultural land use (Mohlis 1974, Dahlgren 1963, Kobriger 1972, Taylor et al. 1976). Limited attempts have been made by resource agencies to offset this trend and restore <b>pheasant</b> populations. However, insufficient budgets have prohibited a concerted attack on the problem. The only government programs which have had a positive impact on <b>pheasant</b> numbers were those involving cropland retirement, none of which were directed toward increasing <b>pheasant</b> numbers. It is generally agreed among <b>pheasant</b> biologists that these programs, given input from wildlife personnel, could have had an even greater impact on <b>pheasant</b> populations. Since the <b>pheasant</b> is such {{an important part of the}} management programs of many agencies, additional attempts will undoubtedly be made to increase <b>pheasant</b> numbers. With grain surpluses now appearing to be a reality once again, federal cropland retirement programs are not entirely unlikely. Resource managers must maximize the effect of any future programs on <b>pheasant</b> numbers. This requires a priori quantitative predictions of the effect of a proposed program on <b>pheasant</b> populations. State agencies need methods to evaluate the effect of several alternative programs to permit selection {{of the most}} feasible approach to increasing <b>pheasant</b> numbers...|$|R
