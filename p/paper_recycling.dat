25|$|The company {{acquired}} Newtech Recycling of Coquitlam in December 2003. Western Canada's {{first and}} largest <b>paper</b> <b>recycling</b> plant was bought to vertically integrate {{a source of}} deinked paper. The acquisition was partially paid for in cash, partially in shares. The site handled 163,000 tonnes of old newsprint from British Columbia and Alberta, {{as well as more}} remote sources, predominantly Minnesota and Kansas City, shipped by train to Coquitlam. Once deinkled, the pulp was sent by barge to Crofton Mill.|$|E
25|$|<b>Paper</b> <b>recycling</b> became common abroad {{during the}} 1980s and {{subsequently}} the Ministry of the Environment initiated proceedings {{to secure a}} source for domestic paper reuse. This led to an agreement in 1992 between Norske Skog and the ministry, in which the company obliged themselves to build a recycling plant for 100,000 tonnes, in exchange {{for access to the}} scrap paper. There was an internal consideration of which mill to build the recycling plant at, and ultimately Skogn was preferred over Follum in a board decision made in August 1993. Skogn was selected because it created mostly standard newsprint and exported to the European market which demanded high deinked pulp (DIP) content.|$|E

500|$|The name Ditton {{comes from}} the Saxon [...] "Dictune" [...] meaning the village {{situated}} on the dike, or trench of water.

2500|$|BisphenolA is a {{preferred}} color developer in {{carbonless copy paper}} and thermal point of sale receipt paper. When used in thermal paper, BPA is present as [...] "free" [...] (i.e., discrete, non-polymerized) BPA, {{which is likely to}} be more available for exposure than BPA polymerized into a resin or plastic. Upon handling, BPA in thermal paper can be transferred to skin, and there is some concern that residues on hands could be ingested through incidental hand-to-mouth contact. Furthermore, some studies suggest that dermal absorption may contribute some small fraction to the overall human exposure. European data indicate that the use of BPA in paper may also contribute to the presence of BPA in the stream of recycled paper and in landfills. Although there are no estimates for the amount of BPA used in thermal paper in the United States, in Western Europe, the volume of BPA reported to be used in thermal paper in 2005/2006 was 1,890 tonnes per year, while total production was estimated at 1,150,000 tonnes per year. [...] (Figures taken from 2012 EPA draft paper.) Studies document potential spreading and accumulation of BPA in <b>paper</b> <b>recycling,</b> suggesting its presence for decades in <b>paper</b> <b>recycling</b> loop even after a hypothetical ban. Epoxy resin may or may not contain BPA, and is employed to bind gutta percha in some root canal procedures.|$|E
2500|$|In pre-industrial times, {{there is}} {{evidence}} of scrap bronze and other metals being collected in Europe and melted down for perpetual reuse. <b>Paper</b> <b>recycling</b> was first recorded in 1031 when Japanese shops sold repulped paper. In Britain dust and ash from wood and coal fires was collected by [...] "dustmen" [...] and downcycled as a base material used in brick making. The main driver for these types of recycling was the economic advantage of obtaining recycled feedstock instead of acquiring virgin material, as well as a lack of public waste removal in ever more densely populated areas. In 1813, Benjamin Law developed the process of turning rags into [...] "shoddy" [...] and [...] "mungo" [...] wool in Batley, Yorkshire. This material combined recycled fibers with virgin wool. The West Yorkshire shoddy industry in towns such as Batley and Dewsbury lasted from the early 19th century to at least 1914.|$|E

2500|$|Besides diet, {{exposure}} {{can also}} occur through air and through skin absorption. Free BPA {{is found in}} high concentration in thermal paper and carbonless copy paper, which {{would be expected to}} be more available for exposure than BPA bound into resin or plastic. [...] Popular uses of thermal paper include receipts, event and cinema tickets, labels, and airline tickets. A Swiss study found that 11 of 13 thermal printing papers contained [...] (BPA). Upon dry finger contact with a thermal paper receipt, roughly [...] BPA (...) was transferred to the forefinger and the middle finger. For wet or greasy fingers approximately [...] more was transferred. Extraction of BPA from the fingers was possible up to [...] after exposure. Further, it has been demonstrated that thermal receipts placed in contact with paper currency in a wallet for 24 hours cause a dramatic increase in the concentration of BPA in paper currency, making paper money a secondary source of exposure. Another study has identified BPA in all of the waste paper samples analysed (newspapers, magazines, office paper, etc.), indicating direct results of contamination through <b>paper</b> <b>recycling.</b> [...] Free BPA can readily be transferred to skin, and residues on hands can be ingested. Bodily intake through dermal absorption (99% of which comes from handling receipts) has been shown for the general population to be 0.219ng/kg bw/day (occupationally exposed persons absorb higher amounts at 16.3ng/kg bw/day) whereas aggregate intake (food/beverage/environment) for adults is estimated at 0.36–0.43 μg/kg bw/day (estimated intake for occupationally exposed adults is 0.043–100 μg/kg bw/day).|$|E
