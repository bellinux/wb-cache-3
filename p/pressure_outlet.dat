50|$|The <b>outlet</b> <b>{{pressure}}</b> and {{the inlet}} pressure hold the diaphragm/poppet assembly in the closed position against {{the force of}} the large spring. If the supply pressure falls, {{it is as if the}} large spring compression is increased allowing more gas and higher pressure to build in the outlet chamber until an equilibrium pressure is reached. Thus, if the supply <b>pressure</b> falls, the <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> will increase, provided the <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> remains below the falling supply pressure. This is the cause of end-of-tank dump where the supply is provided by a pressurized gas tank. With a single stage regulator, when the supply tank gets low, the lower inlet <b>pressure</b> causes the <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> to climb. If the spring compression is not adjusted to compensate, the poppet can remain open and allow the tank to rapidly dump its remaining contents. In other words, the lower the supply pressure, the lower the pressure differential the regulator can achieve for a given spring setting.|$|R

This study {{shows how the}} reacting flow within a gas turbine combustion chamber can {{be influenced by the}} description of the downstream boundary.

40|$|Summary. [...] The present work {{continued}} {{that reported}} in Ref. 1 and extended {{some of the}} results there described to lower entry Much numbers (1. 3 to 1. 9). It was found, as in Ref. 1, that with a parallel entry duct followed by a straight divergent diffuser of 10 deg total angle the flow inside the parallel tube was supersonic provided the <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> of the diffuser {{was less than a}} certain critical value (about 0. 93 of the upstream pitot pressure). In this case the mass flow of air through the tube was equal to that calculated, assuming that all the air incident on the internal section of the tube entry passed through it. For pressures higher than the critical value the flow became subsonic at the duct entry, a shock-wave was formed at the entrance lip and the rate of airflow through the tube decreased. Similar results were obtained for a uniformly divergent tube of 7 deg total angle; in this case, however, an <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> equal to 0. 97 of the upstream pitot pressure was attained before the shock-wave left the lip. For <b>outlet</b> <b>pressures</b> less than the critical the flow was supersonic for a distance inside the duct entry depending on the <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure,</b> the flow becoming subsonic further along the duct. The assumption of unidimensional flow in the duct led to results which showed considerable disagreement with the observed pressure distribution more especially in the subsonic flow region. This could be explained by assuming that the flow in this region separated from the duct wall. The results of tests on models of two forms of annular entry (the Q 1 and t?; 24 / 43 entries respectively) showed that two types of flow rdgime were possible depending on the <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure.</b> For low <b>outlet</b> <b>pressures</b> a shock-wave wa...|$|R

A prototype was designed and the experiment system was set up. The performance of pressure-exchange ejector at different overall <b>pressure</b> ratio and <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> was investigated. Results showed that the entrainment ratio of pressure-exchange ejector reduced with larger pM, while the overall isotropic efficiency tended to go up with increasing <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> pM and then falled down. Higher efficiency could be obtained when the <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> {{was close to the}} average pressure of the channel after a cycle. Besides, the efficiency of pressure-exchange ejector decreased as the overall pressure ratio increasing. The maximum efficiency was about 60 % when pH/pL= 1. 5, while for pH/pL= 2. 0, the maximum efficiency reduced by 15 %. However this value was also much higher than that of the steady flow ejector.
