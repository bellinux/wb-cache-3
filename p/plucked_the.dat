5|$|James Kaliokalani {{was born}} on May 29, 1835. His father High Chief Caesar Kapaʻakea and mother High Chiefess Analea Keohokālole were advisors to the reigning king Kamehameha III. His mother was the {{daughter}} of ʻAikanaka and Kamaʻeokalani while his father was the son of Kamanawa II (half-brother of ʻAikanaka) and Kamokuiki. From his parents, he descended from Keaweaheulu and Kameʻeiamoku, the royal counselors of Kamehameha I during his conquest of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Kameʻeiamoku, the grandfather of both his mother and father, was one of the royal twins alongside Kamanawa depicted on the Hawaiian coat of arms. Kaliokalani's family were collateral relations of the House of Kamehameha. Another relative of the family was the High Chiefess Kapiʻolani who <b>plucked</b> <b>the</b> ʻōhelo berries and openly defied the goddess Pele as a dramatic demonstration of her new faith in Christianity.|$|E
5|$|When the ducklings {{were ready}} for slaughter, the duckers would {{generally}} kill them on their own premises. The slaughter would generally {{take place in the}} morning, to ensure the ducks would be ready for market in the evening. To keep the meat as white as possible, the ducks would be suspended upside down and their necks broken backwards, and held in this position until their blood had run towards their heads. They were kept in this position for ten minutes before being plucked, as otherwise their blood would collect in those parts of the body from which the feathers had been <b>plucked.</b> <b>The</b> plucking was generally carried out by the women of the household. The plucked carcasses would be sent to market, and the feathers would be sold direct to London dealers.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} usual bowing {{technique}} used for most pieces, the Erhu can also be plucked, usually using the second finger of the right hand. This produces a dry, muted tone (if either of the open strings is <b>plucked,</b> <b>the</b> sound is somewhat more resonant) which is sometimes desired in contemporary pieces.|$|E

500|$|English {{rock group}} the Yardbirds {{recorded}} [...] "The Train Kept A-Rollin'" [...] {{during their first}} American tour in 1965.

[...] The Yardbirds' lead guitarist Jeff Beck, who is a fan of early rockabilly, said that he introduced the song to the group: [...] "They just heard me play the riff, and they loved it and made up their version of it". [...] Giorgio Gomelsky, the group' first producer, states that Sonny Boy Williamson II's use of blues harp to imitate train sounds during his 1963 UK tour with the Yardbirds also inspired the band's adaptation of the song.|$|E
500|$|Butcher {{was able}} to save some of his teacher's salary, and to borrow enough more to open the first {{photography}} studio in Custer County. [...] The studio was housed in a lath-and-adobe building, measuring , with a dirt floor and with cotton sheeting in lieu of glass to cover the windows and the skylights. [...] As a backdrop for the photos, he used an old cloth wagon cover. [...] The cloth had been gnawed by rats and was full of holes, which Lillie patched. [...] To keep the patches from showing up in photographs, Butcher attached two coil springs from an old bed to the ceiling, then hung the backdrop from them. [...] Before taking a picture, he <b>plucked</b> <b>the</b> backdrop so that it oscillated on the springs; the motion, combined with the long exposure time required, blurred the backdrop so that the patches would not be visible in the photograph.|$|E

500|$|The crew {{moved to}} Warner Bros. Studios' Stage 16 {{to shoot the}} T. rex attack on the LSX powered SUVs. Shooting proved {{frustrating}} because of water soaking the foam rubber skin of the animatronic dinosaur, which caused the animatronic T. rex to shake and quiver from the extra weight when the foam absorbed the water. This forced Stan Winston's crew to dry the model with shammys between takes. On the set, Malcolm distracting the dinosaur with a flare was included at Jeff Goldblum's suggestion, as he felt a heroic action was better than going by the script, where like Gennaro, Malcolm would get scared and run away. The ripples in the glass of water caused by the T. rexs footsteps were inspired by Spielberg listening to Earth, Wind and Fire in his car, and the vibrations the bass rhythm caused. Lantieri was unsure of how to create the shot until the night before filming, when he put {{a glass of water}} on a guitar he was playing, which achieved the concentric circles in the water Spielberg wanted. The next morning, guitar strings were put inside the car and a man on the floor <b>plucked</b> <b>the</b> strings to achieve the effect. Back at Universal, the crew filmed scenes with the Dilophosaurus on Stage 27. Finally, the shoot finished on Stage 12, with the climactic chases with the raptors in the Park's computer rooms and Visitor's Center. Spielberg changed the climax to bring back the T. rex, abandoning the original ending in which Grant uses a platform machine to maneuver a raptor into a fossil tyrannosaur's jaws. The scene which already had the juxtaposition of live dinosaurs in a museum filled with fossils, while also destroying the bones, now also had an ending where the T. rex saved the protagonists, and afterwards did what Spielberg described as a [...] "King Kong roar" [...] while an ironic banner reading [...] "When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth" [...] flew. The film wrapped twelve days ahead of schedule on November 30, and within days, editor Michael Kahn had a rough cut ready, allowing Spielberg to go ahead with filming Schindler's List.|$|E

2500|$|The ukulele was {{introduced}} to Hawaii by Madeiran immigrants near {{the close of the}} 19th century. The Portuguese brought a small guitar-like instrument, known as the machete. The instrument became a very popular one in Hawaiian culture, and a majority of Hawaiian songs involve the ukulele. In Hawaiian, ukulele literally means [...] "flea (uku) jumping (lele)." [...] It was named as such because when <b>plucked,</b> <b>the</b> high pitch of the strings brings to mind the image of a jumping flea.

'It's not what I mean by the Way. I will show you my Way.' Thereupon he tuned two zithers. He placed {{one of them in}} the hall and the other in an inner chamber. When he <b>plucked</b> <b>the</b> note do [...] on one, do resonated [...] on the other, and when he <b>plucked</b> <b>the</b> note mi [...] on one, mi resonated [...] on the other. It's because their harmonies were the same. If he had retuned one of the strings so it didn't match any note in the pentatonic scale, and had then plucked it, all twenty-five strings on the other zither would have resonated [...] , not because there was any fundamental difference in the sound, but because it was the note that dominated all the rest. May it be that you thinkers are all like this?" [...] (23, tr. Mair 1994: 243) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first few}} months of 1960 saw the ship {{participating}} in Operation [...] "Blue Star", the largest amphibious operation in the Western Pacific since the landings at Inchon, Korea, in September 1950. After returning to San Diego on 29 April 1960, Tulare operated locally in exercises off the west coast, with troop and cargo lifts, until sailing for her fourth deployment to the western Pacific on 19 June 1961. Her special duty on the outbound voyage was to carry cargo to Wake Island. After unloading there, Tulare continued on to Japan. Following two weeks at Yokosuka, the ship visited Beppu, Japan, and headed for Inchon and Pohang, Korea, to take part in Operation [...] "Sharp Edge", in which she embarked 300 Army troops with their equipment. Tulare then visited Hong Kong and several Japanese ports during the summer and early fall of 1961. En route to the Ryukyus in October, Tulare was designated command ship for search and rescue operations for merchantmen Pioneer Muse and Shiek, both aground off Kito Daito Shima. While Tulare directed the operation, [...] arrived on the scene and contributed her Marine helicopters which <b>plucked</b> <b>the</b> survivors from the stranded ships.|$|E

2500|$|Polarization (also polarisation) is a {{property}} applying to transverse waves that specifies the geometrical {{orientation of the}} oscillations. [...] In a transverse wave, {{the direction of the}} oscillation is transverse to the direction of motion of the wave, so the oscillations can have different directions perpendicular to the wave direction. [...] A simple example of a polarized transverse wave is vibrations traveling along a taut string (see image); for example, in a musical instrument like a guitar string. Depending on how the string is <b>plucked,</b> <b>the</b> vibrations can be in a vertical direction, horizontal direction, or at any angle perpendicular to the string. [...] In contrast, in longitudinal waves, such as sound waves in a liquid or gas, the displacement of the particles in the oscillation is always in the direction of propagation, so these waves do not exhibit polarization. [...] Transverse waves that exhibit polarization include electromagnetic waves such as light and radio waves, gravitational waves, and transverse sound waves (shear waves) in solids. [...] In some types of transverse waves, the wave displacement is limited to a single direction, so these also do not exhibit polarization; for example, in surface waves in liquids (gravity waves), the wave displacement of the particles is always in a vertical plane.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his ability as a player, Lazetich developed a reputation as [...] "a wild character {{if there ever was}} one." [...] Decades later, Los Angeles Times columnist Frank Finch wrote that, although modern players were bigger and faster, he preferred the characters of the early NFL over the [...] "faceless robots" [...] of the modern game. [...] He focused in particular on Lazetich: [...] "A character's character was Ram middle guard Milan (Sheriff) Lazetich. [...] He was a blithe spirit from Montana who'd played college football at Michigan before joining the Rams in '46 for a five-year stint. [...] That he lasted that long with the club is remarkable in light of what he pulled at Dan Reeves' Christmas party for the team {{at the end of the}} '46 season." [...] Reeves, the Rams' owner, invited the team to a party at his home; the centerpiece was a large cake in the design of a football field topped with a full-size football covered in chocolate. [...] Teammate and Pro Football Hall of Famer Tom Fears later recalled the incident this way:"During the course of predinner libations, someone asked Lazetich to demonstrate his punting prowess. [...] I don't think he'd ever kicked a football before in his life. [...] They dared him to boot the chocolate football, which was a big mistake because Laz wasn't the kind of guy to take a dare lightly. [...] He ambled out to the kitchen, <b>plucked</b> <b>the</b> football off the top of the fancy cake, brought it out in the front room and drove his toe into it with beautiful form and a perfect follow through. [...] Cake, frosting and everything else that was loose was well distributed over the ceiling, walls, windows and drapes. ... It also was the last party Reeves ever held in his house for the Rams." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sonnet 128 {{is one of}} the sonnets in the Dark Lady series. [...] Sonnet 128 {{has often}} been said to be a {{complimentary}} sonnet to the Dark Lady and her musical talents. [...] Shakespeare uses this sonnet as a comparison of his lust for the Dark Lady through musical metaphors. [...] For example, Shakespeare in the first stanza of the sonnet compares the Dark Lady's playing of the virginal, a musical instrument similar to the piano, to his want for the Dark Lady to be touching him instead of the virginal. [...] Shakespeare plays off the phrase, [...] "jacks that nimble leap" [...] giving it a sexual connotation. [...] In the virginal a jack was the, [...] "upright piece of wood fixed {{to the back of the}} key-lever, and fitted with a quill which <b>plucked</b> <b>the</b> string as the jack rose on the key's being pressed down". [...] Shakespeare has been criticized for possibly using the word [...] "jacks" [...] in the wrong sense, but Shakespeare sexualizes [...] "jacks" [...] in line five and thirteen. [...] Through the use of the word [...] "leaping" [...] in this phrase, Shakespeare uses word play on the word virginal using it in the virgin sense. [...] And at the end of the sonnet, Shakespeare refers to jacks as [...] "saucy" [...] giving it another sexual connotation. [...] Shakespeare plays off the idea that the jacks are leaping into the Dark Lady, and kissing her inner hands. [...] This interpretation is highly criticized, and other critics believe that Shakespeare just carelessly used the word [...] "jacks" [...] wrong because of his infatuation with the Dark Lady. [...] At the end of the sonnet, Shakespeare concludes in the last two lines with, [...] "Since saucy jacks so happy are in this, / Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss." [...] Here, Shakespeare ends the poem with the idea that the Dark Lady should kiss him after teasing him with her musical talent throughout the poem.|$|E
