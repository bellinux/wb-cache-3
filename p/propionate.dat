30|$|In this study, {{possibilities}} for enzymatic production of oligosaccharide esters are explored, using <b>propionates</b> and acrylates as examples.

Acrylates and <b>propionates</b> of carbohydrates have been described in the literature with a maximum of two monosaccharidic residues [1 – 3]. The most widely used synthesis strategy is regioselective (trans)esterification catalyzed by lipases, under mild conditions. The reaction media are apolar organic solvent with low water content to avoid hydrolytic side reactions. While successful enzymatic synthesis of esters of mono and disaccharides has been reported in a large number of cases [4 – 7], esterification of longer carbohydrates is very difficult to achieve [7]. However, acylation of maltotriose was achieved using vinyl esters as acyl donors and 2 -methyl- 2 -butanol/dimethyl sulfoxide as solvent [8]. Enzymatic esterification of starch has been reported, but recent detailed {{studies have shown that the}} analysis methods used in most previous studies are not reliable [9].

40|$|In the homodimeric {{hemoglobin}} from Scapharca, HbI, functional {{communication between}} the two heme groups is based on their direct structural linkage across the subunit interface through the heme <b>propionates.</b> The heme-protein interactions have been altered in deutero- and meso-HbI by substituting the vinyl groups at positions 2 and 4 of protoheme with hydrogen and ethyl groups, respectively.

Oxygen pulse and flash photolysis experiments indicate that meso-HbI is locked in the liganded conformation. It is postulated that the ethyl groups, which occupy a larger volume than vinyl ones, impair the ligand-linked movement of the heme relative to its pocket and in turn the expression of cooperativity.

The midpoint reduction potential of lysine (K 61 A) mutant was determined by spectroelectrochemical titration to be 61 ± 3 mV vs. SHE, similar to the WT protein (68 ± 3 mV). The addition of guanidinium hydrochloride resulted in protein denaturation that could show more than one process and occurred over days.
