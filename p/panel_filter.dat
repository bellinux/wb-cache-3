The filter provides {{images of the}} resonant scattered spectra of N+ 2 1 N (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3) bands and a neutral N 2 2 P (0, 3) band. Ab initio models were created for describing the populations of vibrational and rotational energy levels in both excited and ionised N 2 molecules in the ionosphere. In the rotational profiles the species are treated to be in thermal equilibrium, whereas the vibrational levels assume a non-thermal steady state time independent model. Rotational temperatures were evaluated for different auroral forms for the N+ 2 (0, 2) band from the magnetic zenith and along the meridian slit in HiTIES data from winter. A clear trend in neutral temperature is found, with higher values for times of lower energy precipitation. The relationship between resonant scattering of solar photons via N+ 2 and direct emission from electron impact on N 2 was evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively with HiTIES data from January-March 2007. A relationship was found that clearly indicates the emission profiles are a function of primary electron energy and solar shadow height when auroral arcs are partially sunlit during events of electron precipitation. <br/...|$|E

The fibrous HVAC filters were previously rated by the manufacturers according to ASHRAE Standard 52. 2 and ranged from shallow (2. 5 cm) fiberglass <b>panel</b> <b>filters</b> (MERV 4) to deep-bed (12. 7 cm) electrostatically charged synthetic media filters (MERV 16). Measured removal efficiency ranged from 0 to 10 % for most ultrafine particles (UFP) sizes with the lowest rated filters (MERV 4 and 6) to 60 – 80 % for most UFP sizes with the highest rated filter (MERV 16). The deeper bed filters generally achieved higher removal efficiencies than the <b>panel</b> <b>filters,</b> while maintaining a low pressure drop and higher airflow rate in the operating HVAC system. Assuming constant efficiency, a modeling effort using these measured values for new filters and other inputs from real buildings shows that MERV 13 – 16 filters could reduce the indoor proportion of outdoor UFPs (in the absence of indoor sources) {{by as much as}} a factor of 2 – 3 in a typical single-family residence relative to the lowest efficiency filters, depending in part on particle size...|$|R

There {{are several}} methods of {{backlighting}} an LCD panel using LEDs, {{including the use}} of either white or RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) LED arrays behind the panel and edge-LED lighting (which uses white LEDs around the inside frame of the TV and a light-diffusion panel to spread the light evenly behind the LCD panel). Variations in LED backlighting offer different benefits. The first commercial full-array LED-backlit LCD TV was the Sony Qualia 005 (introduced in 2004), which used RGB LED arrays to produce a color gamut about twice that of a conventional CCFL LCD television.

Recent reductions in {{the density of the}} filter media in scrubber <b>filter</b> <b>panels</b> have suggested concomitant decreases in dust collection efficiencies and increases in the exposure levels of mine workers to respirable silica dust. A description of the structure and operation of continuous miners with flooded bed scrubbers was presented. The respirable silica collection efficiencies of wire mesh <b>filter</b> <b>panels</b> constructed using 10, 15, 20, or 30 layers of stainless steel wire mesh and of two synthetic filters were examined using both high and low capacity scrubbers with supplying air velocities of 2, 200 or 3, 500 feet per minute at the scrubber filter.

40|$|Particulate matter removal at high {{temperatures}} {{has gained a}} great attention {{in the last years}} due to the vast growing of power production plants around the world. A reliable and robust gas cleaning method is inherently necessary to facilitate efficient fuel to energy conversion while protecting all the downstream equipments in a plant. In accordance with the current demand, a detail study has been conducted on <b>panel</b> bed <b>filter</b> which exhibits the suitable characteristic for high temperature applications. The thesis focuses on four main parts related to the  design evaluation, experimental verification and development of new apparatus and method for regeneration  in a <b>panel</b> bed <b>filter.</b> The four main parts are as following; 1. Testing of an advanced new louver design, “ filter tray ” at room and elevated temperature 2. Development of a new apparatus and method  for puff-back cleaning 3. Testing of “filter tray” with the new puff-back apparatus and 4. Industrial scale <b>panel</b> bed <b>filter</b> testing in a commercial combustion plant. A very first laboratory scale <b>panel</b> bed <b>filter</b> with filter tray louvers was built and tested at room temperature. Tests were performed mainly at higher filtration velocities (7 – 31 cm/s) with sintered bauxite spherical particles (mean diameter of 710 m) as filtration medium with standardized test dust (mean diameter of 9 m). The filter demonstrated excellent results at filtration velocity of 30 cm/s however unstable residual pressure drop profile and high dust penetration were recorded, suggesting the depth of the granular beds are too shallow. A second laboratory scale panel-bed filter with filter tray louvers with deeper granular beds, i. e. 40 mm was built. The gas-entry surfaces are much larger than the first test rig. Tests were performed from low to high filtration velocities with sintered bauxite spherical particles (mean diameter of 470 & 710 m) and olivine sand particles (mean diameter of 545 m) as filtration medium and standardized test dust (mean diameter of 4 & 9 m) as test dust at room temperature and at 120 °C. The filter illustrated excellent results however failure in the conventional puff-back method to supply sufficient sharp pressure pulse led to improper removal of filter cake. Accordingly, {{there is a need for}} an improved means of supplying puff-back gas to the tall wide panel beds. A novel high speed valve, a new method and apparatus for creating a longitudinally disposed sharp puff of gas for renewal of gas-entry surfaces was built and tested independently. The quick opening valve consists of a standard cylinder with air outlet holes, a rod with nylon plugs and an actuator. The valve was built in the laboratory; several adjustments were made along the test until the time for emptying of the pressure in the tank was less than 50 ms. It was then integrated with the second test rig, referred to as third  test rig. Tests were performed at room temperature with the aid of high-speed camera to obtain visualization of the movement of the granular beds during puff-back with and without the presence of filter cake. Filtration test were performed at elevated temperature of 120 °C. Tests were performed from low to high filtration velocities with sintered bauxite spherical particles (mean diameter of 470 µm) and olivine sand particles (mean diameter of 545 m) as filtration medium and standardized test dust (mean diameter of 4 m). The results and video file analysis revealed that the new puff-back method is capable of removing the entire filter cake, resulting in stable residual pressure profile and very low dust penetration compared to the conventional puff-back. An industrial scale <b>panel</b> bed <b>filter</b> testing is the fourth test rig. The field test was performed with a single filter module of louver design L 10 - 56 at a 450 -kW biomass combustion plant at Bjertnæs Sag AS in Jevnaker in Norway. The test was performed with a slip stream from the main stream of exhaust gas before emitting to the chimney. The test was performed at superficial velocity between 5. 4 - 6. 9 cm/s with total flow rate of 290 - 370 m 3 /h at 120 °C with inlet dust concentration between 1. 4 to 1. 8 g/m 3. Olivine sand particles with mean diameter of 545 m were used as filtration medium. The results showed filter cakes are being formed on the gas-entry surfaces and the penetration was lower than the allowed limit during the beginning of the test. Nonetheless, due to some instability caused probably by some slight variation in the louver geometry led to higher emission towards the end of the test and hence further testing was interrupted.

40|$|CH 2 M HILL Hanford Group, Inc. (CH 2 M HILL) plays a {{critical}} role in Hanford Site cleanup for the U. S. Department of Energy, Office of River Protection (ORP). CH 2 M HILL is responsible for the management of 177 tanks containing 53 million gallons of highly radioactive wastes generated from weapons production activities from 1943 through 1990. In that time, 149 single-shell tanks, ranging in capacity from 50, 000 gallons to 500, 000 gallons, and 28 double-shell tanks with a capacity of 1 million gallons each, were constructed and filled with toxic liquid wastes and sludges. The cleanup mission includes removing these radioactive waste solids from the single-shell tanks to double-shell tanks for staging as feed to the Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) on the Hanford Site for vitrification of the wastes and disposal on the Hanford Site and Yucca Mountain repository. Concentrated efforts in retrieving residual solid and sludges from the single-shell tanks began in 2003; the first tank retrieved was C- 106 in the 200 East Area of the site. The process for retrieval requires installation of modified sluicing systems, vacuum systems, and pumping systems into existing tank risers. Inherent with this process is the removal of existing pumps, thermo-couples, and agitating and monitoring equipment from the tank to be retrieved. Historically, these types of equipment have been extremely difficult to manage from the aspect of radiological dose, size, and weight of the equipment, as well as their attendant operating and support systems such as electrical distribution and control <b>panels,</b> <b>filter</b> systems, and mobile retrieval systems. Significant effort and expense were required to manage this new waste stream and resulted in several events over time that were both determined to be unsafe for workers and potentially unsound for protection of the environment. Over the last four years, processes and systems have been developed that reduce worker exposures to these hazards, eliminate violations of RCRA storage regulations, reduce costs for waste management by nearly 50 percent, and create a viable method for final treatment and disposal of these waste forms that does not impact retrieval project schedules. This paper is intended to provide information to the nuclear and environmental clean-up industry with the experience of CH 2 M HILL and ORP in managing these highly difficult waste streams, as well as providing an opportunity for sharing lessons learned, including technical methods and processes that may be applied at other DOE sites...|$|R
40|$|Underground {{coal mining}} {{companies}} that operate continuous miner sections often {{apply to the}} Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) for approval to take extended cuts to depths of up to 40 ft {{as a means of}} improving productivity. Historically, MSHA has granted approval of this practice if the mine has successfully demonstrated the ability to control the roof, methane, and respirable dust while extracting these extended cuts. A key component for controlling dust generated by continuous miners in 40 -ft cuts has been the utilization of flooded-bed scrubbers. These fan-powered scrubbers pull dust-laden air from the mining face and remove respirable dust particles by passing the collected air through a wetted <b>filter</b> <b>panel.</b> The <b>filtered</b> air is then discharged back into the mine atmosphere. To effectively use scrubbers in faces that employ exhaust ventilation, the return ventilation curtain or tubing should be located outby the scrubber discharge on the continuous miner, which results in a setback distance from the face of approximately 40 ft. Over the last several years, MSHA has emphasized that mines demonstrate effective dust control before granting approvals for taking extended cuts with extended curtain setbacks. Each mine operator must successfully demonstrate control of workers 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 dust exposures in standard 20 -ft cuts before MSHA considers approving extended cuts. The goal of the research conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) was to compare dust levels generated in 20 -ft cuts when using traditional exhaust face ventilation without a scrubber to dust levels in 20 -ft cuts when using extended curtain setbacks with a scrubber operating. Dust surveys were completed at three mines, with area and personal sampling conducted to quantify respirable dust concentrations on a cut-by-cut basis. Dust sampling results did not show a statistically significant difference (Wilcoxon two-sample test, 1 = 0. 05) in respirable dust concentrations between these two test conditions (scrubber-on and scrubber-off) at the continuous miner or shuttle car sampling locations at the face.

3000|$|As {{can be seen}} in the {{left-hand}} <b>panels,</b> the RC <b>filter</b> does not affect the baseband signal-to-noise ratio, as it only reduces the power of the noise outside of the channel. Also, since the time constant is small, the noise remains impulsive (7 dBc), as {{can be seen in}} the upper panels on the left showing the in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) time domain traces. On the other hand, the DoL circuit (the right-hand panels) improves the signal-to-noise ratio in the baseband by 7.4 dB, effectively suppressing the impulsive component of the noise and reducing the noise peakedness to 2.4 dBc. By comparing the black lines in the upper panels of the figure, for the RC and the DoL circuits, one can see how the DoL circuit removes the impulsive noise by [...] "trimming" [...] the outliers while following the narrower-bandwidth trend.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} nonhomogeneous autoregressive processes which are special {{cases of the}} vector-valued autoregressive processes considered by Anderson (1978) {{for the analysis of}} panel survey data. We point out that, for a nonhomogeneous autoregressive process of order higher than one, the least-squares estimates cannot be obtained unless repeated measurements are made on the time series. We present here two Bayesian approaches based on Kaiman filter models which alleviate the above difficulty and result in an alternative strategy for the analyses of nonhomogeneous autoregressive processes. In our first approach the notion of exchangeability plays a key role, whereas for our second approach, which results in an adaptive Kaiman filter model, an approxima-tion due to Lindley facilitates the necessary computations for inference.
