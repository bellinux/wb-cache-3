5|$|In 2009, after {{negotiations}} with the Port of Ploče Authority, Luka Ploče was granted a 32-year extension of its concession contract for the cargo handling operations of the port. The contract requires the port authority to improve <b>port</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and Luka Ploče to invest in new cargo handling equipment. Those investments were compensated by extension of the concession period for individual terminals to 45 years. A further increase in cargo volume {{was reported in the}} first half of 2011, compared with the same period of 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Ploče {{recorded}} a steady {{growth and development}} from 1945, but suffered a sharp decline between 1991 and 1996 due to the Croatian War of Independence and the Bosnian War. In the late 2000s, Luka Ploče d.d., the primary concessionaire of the Port of Ploče, embarked on an ambitious investment plan, aiming for {{a substantial increase in}} the volume of port operations. Funding was secured in 2007, and Luka Ploče d.d. plans to invest €91million in <b>port</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and around €180million in port equipment by 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Ploče Authority was {{established}} by the Government of Croatia on February 13, 1997, to oversee construction, maintenance, administration, protection and promotion of the Port of Ploče. Since 1998, the general and bulk cargo operations of the port have been operated by Luka Ploče d.d. and development has resumed. In 2009, after negotiations with the Port of Ploče Authority, Luka Ploče was granted a 32-year extension of the concession contract for the cargo handling operations of the port. The contract requires the port authority to improve <b>port</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and Luka Ploče to invest in new cargo handling equipment.

40|$|Port {{operations}} are highly {{important in the}} central economic and industrial regions which rely heavily {{on the use of}} <b>port</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> An economic and efficient maintenance strategy is essential to govern the normal running of <b>port</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and thus seaborne transportation. Many agencies worldwide have managed to develop maintenance strategies to ensure optimal levels of serviceability and safety for <b>port</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> However, there is not much information about how sustainable issues can be implemented in the maintenance planning. This paper proposes a methodology for evaluating, comparing and improving sustainability of maintenance strategies for <b>port</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> The method is developed based on a proposed randomized structural deterioration model. The costs due to retrofitting, operating loss and environmental loss are considered in the total life cycle cost estimation. The concept of utility function is utilized to serve as a criterion for finding the optimal strategy among the alternative maintenance strategies. An investigation is performed on a Tokyo wharf to demonstrate the proposed approach. The maintenance strategies for different structural elements in the <b>port</b> <b>infrastructures</b> are discussed. The results show that the proposed approach can provide more reliable information on the maintenance timing. The predicted cost bounds allow owners/risk managers to understand the current condition of the structure in several ways, which include both safe-side prediction and average prediction...|$|R

5|$|The overall {{infrastructure}} of Malaysia {{is one of}} the most developed in Asia and ranked 8th in Asia and 25th in the world. Malaysia is ranked 19th in the world for its quality roads, quality of <b>port</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and quality of air transport infrastructure but ranked 39th in quality of electricity supply. Its telecommunications network is second only to Singapore's in Southeast Asia, with 4.7million fixed-line subscribers and more than 30million cellular subscribers. The country has seven international ports, the major one being the Port Klang. There are 200 industrial parks along with specialised parks such as Technology Park Malaysia and Kulim Hi-Tech Park. Fresh water is available to over 95 per cent of the population. During the colonial period, development was mainly concentrated in economically powerful cities and in areas forming security concerns. Although rural areas have been the focus of great development, they still lag behind areas such as the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The telecommunication network, although strong in urban areas, is less available to the rural population.|$|E

25|$|Historically, the Jin River {{was used}} for boat traffic {{in and out of}} Chengdu. However, due {{to the size of the}} river itself and the reduced water depth over time, the Brocade River is no longer capable of {{carrying}} any type of water traffic. Therefore, Chengdu has no direct access to the Yangtze River or any other larger river. However, to ensure that Chengdu's goods have access to the river efficiently, inland port cities of Yibin and Luzhou—both of which are reachable from Chengdu within hours by expressways—on the Yangtze have commenced large-scale <b>port</b> <b>infrastructure</b> development. As materials and equipment for the rebuilding of northern Sichuan are sent in from the East Coast to Sichuan, these ports will see significant increases in throughput.|$|E
25|$|Rio Tinto {{iron ore}} {{operations}} in the Pilbara began in 1966. Exploration work through Hancock Prospecting at the Hope Downs 4 deposit began in 1992. Hancock unsuccessfully tried to develop the project {{with a number of}} partners, briefly rumored to be planning to join up with the Fortescue Metals Group in 2005, who was then developing its Cloud Break mine in the region. The development of the project suffered further delays when attempts to gain access to BHP Billiton's rail network failed, burdening the project with a further A$1 billion in cost to construct rail and <b>port</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> Eventually, in July 2005, Rio Tinto became a partner in the project instead, making thereby the construction of major infrastructure unnecessary, and, after spending A$1.3 billion, the mine moved into production in November 2007. The mine has an annual production capacity of 30 million tonnes of iron ore, sourced from open-pit operations. The ore is processed on site before being loaded onto rail.|$|E
500|$|Although {{a tunnel}} {{connecting}} the Port of Miami to Watson Island was first {{proposed in the}} 1980s, when the House rejected President Ronald Reagan's attempt to veto the bill to conduct a premilinary study and called it a [...] "pork-barrel" [...] project, when the port was only connected to the mainland by a two-lane drawbridge (the current six lane elevated bridge {{was built in the}} early 1990s), it was not until 2006 that the tender for the tunnel project was ready to be launched and December 2007 that the project was approved by City Commission. However, the economic crisis resulted in a cancellation of the project in December 2008 by one of the sponsors, Babcock & Brown, and the State of Florida. Despite this, in April 2009, following intense lobbying by Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Alvarez, to avoid a new tender that would delay even further the start of construction, the project was reinstated. Port director Bill Johnson has also {{played a key role in}} supporting the Port of Miami infrastructure projects, as well as developing a free-trade pact with Colombia. Altogether, the <b>port</b> <b>infrastructure</b> projects had an estimated cost of around two billion dollars.|$|E
40|$|U. S. ports serve a {{vital role}} in the nation’s supply chain and {{international}} trade. While the areas surrounding these ports bear the external costs of port expansion (conges-tion, air and noise pollution), neighboring regions feel the benefits and additional costs from port activity. Given the current debate over external costs from port activity, it is important to quantify {{the costs and benefits of}} ports on industry in the home state and neighboring states. This study assesses the role that transportation infrastructure plays in production and employment in the manufacturing industry. Using state-level data from the 48 contiguous states, the authors model manufacturing production and cost, incorporating state and local investment in <b>port</b> and highway <b>infrastructure</b> as vari-ables. The authors find lower manufacturing costs in states with increased ports infra-structure. However manufacturing firms experience higher costs if a neighboring state increases its <b>ports</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> perhaps because productive resources (firms and workers) are drawn to states that increase <b>ports</b> <b>infrastructure...</b>|$|R

500|$|Although {{there is}} great {{speculation}} that the Port of Miami Tunnel project is both unnecessary and a waste of taxpayer dollars, {{it is expected to}} have positive benefits in the long run which coincide with several other related projects predicted to increase its traffic, many, such as the Port of Miami Deep Dredge Project and Panama Canal expansion, slated to be finished in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The port has gone through several expensive projects throughout its history, and many have been seen as beneficial to the economic growth of the Greater Miami area in the long run, such as in the 1950s when the deteriorating Port of Miami, then located in the mainland in downtown, was moved to its current home, the man-made Dodge Island. The current port director of the Port of Miami Bill Johnson states that these new <b>port</b> <b>infrastructure</b> projects should be able to double the port's container capacity over the next decade. Miami City Commissioner Marc Sarnoff stated that [...] "This is the best public works project ever." [...] A strong trade industry is also considered to be a vital sign of a good and improving economy.|$|E

In 1977, Salmide spoke about the incident in an interview with Reuters. He recalled, [...] "My family were Huguenots, and I acted according to my Christian conscience, I could not accept that the port would be wantonly destroyed when the war was clearly lost." [...] On 22 August 1944, four days before the planned destruction of the port, he blew up the munitions depot where the Germans had stored 4,000 fuses to be used in destroying the port. Salmide [...] "laid strips of dynamite inside the supply bunker filled with demolition hardware and thousands of pounds of ordnance and watched as the city shook from the huge explosion."

When Basra was established during Umar's rule, he started building a nine mile canal from Tigris to the new city for conveying drinking water and for irrigation. [...] Al-Tabari reports that 'Utba ibn Ghazwan built the first canal from the Tigris River to the site of Basra when the city was in the planning stage. After the city was built, Umar appointed Abu Musa Ashaari as its first governor. Abu Musa Ashaari governed during the period 17-29/638 – 650. He began building two important canals linking Basra with the Tigris River. These were al-Ubulla River and the Ma'qil River. The two canals were the basis for the agricultural development for the whole Basra region and used for drinking water. Umar also devised the policy of cultivating barren lands by assigning such lands to those who undertook to cultivate them. This policy continued during the Umayyad period and it resulted in the cultivation of large areas of barren lands through the construction of irrigation canals by the state and by individuals.|$|E
