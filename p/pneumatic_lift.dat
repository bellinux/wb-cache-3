5000|$|The TOSCO II {{process is}} {{classified}} as a hot recycled solids technology. [...] It employs a horizontal rotating kiln-type retort. In this process, oil shale is crushed smaller than 0.5 in and enters the system through <b>pneumatic</b> <b>lift</b> pipes in which oil shale is elevated by hot gas streams and preheated to about [...] [...] After entering into retort, oil shale is mixed with hot ceramic balls with temperature from [...] to [...] This increase the oil shale temperature to between [...] and , in which pyrolysis occurs. In the pyrolysis process, kerogen decomposes to oil shale gas and oil vapors, while {{the remainder of the}} oil shale forms spent shale. Vapors are transferred to a condensor (fractionator) for separation into various fractions. [...] At the kiln passage, the spent shale and the ceramic balls are separated in a perforated rotating separation drum (trommel). The crushed spent shale falls through holes in the trommel, while ceramic balls are transferred to the ball heater. Combustible shale gas is burned in the ball heater to reheat the ceramic balls.|$|E
50|$|As a heat carrier, LLNL HRS process uses spent {{oil shale}}. Raw oil shale and spent oil shale are mixed in the {{fluidized}} bed mixer. The use of fluidized bed mixer results in better mixture, {{which in turn}} increases the mean quantity of oil yield and oil shale throughput. From the fluidized bed mixer oil shale moves downward to the packed-bed pyrolyzer. The heat is transferred from the heated spent oil shale to the raw oil shale causing pyrolysis. As a result, oil shale decomposes to shale oil vapors, oil shale gas and spent oil shale. Oil vapors are collected from the pyrolyzer. The spent oil shale, still including residual carbon (char), by the air <b>pneumatic</b> <b>lift</b> pipe to the delayed-fall combustor where it is combusted to heat the process. The delayed-fall combustor used in this process gives greater control over the combustion process as compared to a lift pipe combustor. From the delayed-fall combustor the oil shale ash and spent shale falls into a fluidized bed classifier where the finest parts of solids are removed and hot spent shale is forwarded to the fluidized bed mixer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Soft {{actuators}} {{are expected}} to be applied for hu-man assistive devices by making multiple actuators cooperate. However, it is difficult to cooperative control them using con-ventional linear controllers because soft actuators have non-linear characteristics. On the other hand, humans are able to control own muscle which is nonlinear actuator and work together. In this paper, an intelligent cooperative controller that controls cooperative movement of multiple nonlinear actuators is proposed. The controller was constructed referring to a human’s cooperative work, and consists of multiple control parts, each control part handles each actuator. The effectiveness of the proposed controller was confirmed experimentally using a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>lift</b> device. I...|$|E
40|$|When a {{plate with}} air discharing through its center is brought near a flat disc, the {{resultant}} partial vacuum {{between the two}} surfaces permits the disc to be lifted by the plate without contact. 　This paper deals with {{the way in which}} the maximum weight which can be lifted is influenced by changing the ratio of the diameter of the upper plate with its orifice to the diameter of the orifice and the total pressure measured at the center of the lower disc. 　Experimental results show that the maximum weight which can be lifted is linearly dependent on the total pressure. The results further show when the diameter of the upper plate is constant and the diameter of the orifice is made larger, the total pressure which is needed to lift a certain weight decreases, but the rate of the air flow increases. 　It is also concluded that the diameter of the orifice excerts a greater influence on the pressure distribution than that of the upper plate, therfore {{the way in which the}} orifice is made is very important in designing the <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Lift...</b>|$|E

40|$|Under {{contract}} to the DOE Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies, the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) is developing and evaluating pneumatic (blown) aerodynamic devices {{to improve the}} performance, economics, stability and safety of operation of Heavy Vehicles. The objective of this program is to apply the pneumatic aerodynamic aircraft technology previously developed and flight-tested by GTRI personnel {{to the design of}} an efficient blown tractor-trailer configuration. Recent experimental results obtained by GTRI using blowing have shown drag reductions of 35 % on a streamlined automobile wind-tunnel model. Also measured were lift or down-load increases of 100 - 150 % and the ability to control aerodynamic moments about all 3 axes without any moving control surfaces. Similar drag reductions yielded by blowing on bluff afterbody trailers in current US trucking fleet operations are anticipated to reduce yearly fuel consumption by more than 1. 2 billion gallons, while even further reduction is possible using <b>pneumatic</b> <b>lift</b> to reduce tire rolling resistance. Conversely, increased drag and down force generated instantaneously by blowing can greatly increase braking characteristics and control in wet/icy weather due to effective ''weight'' increases on the tires. Safety is also enhanced by controlling side loads and moments caused on these Heavy Vehicles by winds, gusts and other vehicles passing. This may also help to eliminate the jack-knifing problem if caused by extreme wind side loads on the trailer. Lastly, reduction of the turbulent wake behind the trailer can reduce splash and spray patterns and rough air being experienced by following vehicles. To be presented by GTRI in this paper will be results developed during the early portion of this effort, including a preliminary systems study, CFD prediction of the blown flowfields, and design of the baseline conventional tractor-trailer model and the pneumatic wind-tunnel model...|$|E
40|$|In the Task I {{portion of}} this NASA {{research}} grant, configuration development and experimental investigations have been conducted {{on a series of}} pneumatic high-lift and control surface devices applied to a generic High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) model configuration to determine their potential for improved aerodynamic performance, plus stability and control of higher performance aircraft. These investigations were intended to optimize <b>pneumatic</b> <b>lift</b> and drag performance; provide adequate control and longitudinal stability; reduce separation flowfields at high angle of attack; increase takeoff/climbout lift-to-drag ratios; and reduce system complexity and weight. Experimental aerodynamic evaluations were performed on a semi-span HSCT generic model with improved fuselage fineness ratio and with interchangeable plain flaps, blown flaps, pneumatic Circulation Control Wing (CCW) high-lift configurations, plain and blown canards, a novel Circulation Control (CC) cylinder blown canard, and a clean cruise wing for reference. Conventional tail power was also investigated for longitudinal trim capability. Also evaluated was unsteady pulsed blowing of the wing high-lift system to determine if reduced pulsed mass flow rates and blowing requirements could be made to yield the same lift as that resulting from steady-state blowing. Depending on the pulsing frequency applied, reduced mass flow rates were indeed found able to provide lift augmentation at lesser blowing values than for the steady conditions. Significant improvements in the aerodynamic characteristics leading to improved performance and stability/control were identified, and the various components were compared to evaluate the pneumatic potential of each. Aerodynamic results were provided to the Georgia Tech Aerospace System Design Lab. to conduct the companion system analyses and feasibility study (Task 2) of theses concepts applied to an operational advanced HSCT aircraft. Results and conclusions from these experimental evaluations are presented herein, as are recommendations for further development and follow-on investigations.

A skeleton crew quickly moves rockets into position and fires them singly or in bulk with minimal logistical support. Some rockets are hidden underground with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>lifts</b> to raise and fire them or launched from trucks. Although Israel can target the launch sites within minutes of a launch, the IDF in 2006 could generally not destroy launch sites before use and therefore could not stop the rain of rocket attacks.|$|R

40|$|The {{recovery}} of light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) from low permeability glacial soils (silts and clays) can be problematic due to low well yields. The use of {{high vacuum technology}} (including bioslurping, vacuum enhanced recovery and/or multi-phase extraction) has been used at these types of sites to improve LNAPL recovery rates in comparison to traditional pump and treat technologies. However, the use of high vacuum alone is limited to recovering LNAPL from relatively shallow depths (typically less than 25 to 30 feet (7. 6 to 9. 1 metres) due to the lift limitations of vacuum technology. This paper examines the {{recovery of}} LNAPL from depths in excess of 30 feet (9. 1 metres) at a large General Motors manufacturing site in eastern Michigan (Site).
