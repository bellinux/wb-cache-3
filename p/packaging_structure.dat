40|$|The <b>package</b> <b>structure</b> {{critically}} {{influences the}} major characteristics of semiconductor lasers, such as thermal behavior, output power, wavelength, and far-field distribution. In this paper, a new single emitter <b>package</b> <b>structure</b> called F-mount is designed and {{compared with the}} conventional <b>package</b> <b>structure</b> C-mount. The influence of <b>package</b> <b>structure</b> on their performances is characterized and analyzed. The thermal resistances of lasers with different <b>package</b> <b>structures</b> are calculated through simulation, and are contrasted with experimental results. Some devices are also tested for the maximum output power level. Under the continuous wave (CW) condition, the maximum power of F-mount reaches 12. 6 W at 808 nm while the output power only reaches 10. 9 W for C-mount. Under the condition of 0. 5 % duty cycle (100 mu s, 50 Hz), the catastrophic optical mirror damage level reaches 58. 7 W at 74 A for F-mount, and 54. 8 W at 57 A for C-mount are reported for the first time. It is experimentally found {{that there is an}} obvious wavelength difference between the two type structure lasers: about 1. 37 nm in CW mode and 2. 89 nm in quasi CW mode. Theoretical analysis shows that red-shift and blue-shift is a result of external strain in the package process of F-mount and C-mount, respectively. It is also found that the <b>package</b> <b>structure</b> has an effect on the divergence angle of slow axis far fields, but little impact on that of fast axis far fields. The analysis shows that <b>package</b> <b>structure</b> has a strong influence on the performance of the laser; therefore, the package should be optimized to achieve better performance for some special applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the financial elements of remuneration and its motivational features; to describe specific delimitations for the remuneration system in the public sector, and, on the basis of this information, to create a model for a possible remuneration <b>package</b> <b>structure</b> and to predict its future effect on the motivational level of public sector employees. This study provides an analysis of the existing remuneration <b>package</b> <b>structure</b> for public servants in Latvia and, based on a theoretical background, it offers proposals for the improvement of a remuneration <b>package</b> <b>structure</b> that aims to ensure its functionality and to provide possibilities to motivate employees. As a result of this analysis, the general and motivating parts of a remuneration package were defined, the last being divided into fixed and variable parts. An examination of the appropriate legislation has lead to the conclusion that the present combination of financial elements of remuneration has neither a clearly fixed, nor a clearly variable nature. Two alternative structures for a remuneration package have been proposed, namely, a fixed remuneration <b>package</b> <b>structure</b> and a remuneration package with a significant proportion of variable part. In the case of implementation of a fixed remuneration <b>package</b> <b>structure</b> it is forecast that all transparency and fairness (equality) principles will be met, stability of the remuneration system will be ensured, and, as well, a positive image of the public sector within the labour market will be sustained. The implementation of a remuneration package with significant variable part should ensure a stronger link between the level of remuneration and job output of employee, as well as to provide more flexible possibilities to stimulate employees for immediate actions. For the practical implementation of both proposed alternatives and for a revision of current remuneration levels in nominal terms, the authors propose the utilisation of an employee job output and remuneration level correlation matrix, thus ensuring an optimal equilibrium of output and remuneration and a targeted usage of remuneration funds...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{software}} maintenance activities performed without following {{the original design}} decisions about the <b>package</b> <b>structure</b> usually deteriorate the quality of software modularization, leading to decay {{of the quality of}} the system. One of the main reasons for such structural deterioration is inappropriate grouping of source code classes in software packages. To improve such grouping/modular-structure, previous researchers formulated the software remodularization problem as an optimization problem and solved it using search-based meta-heuristic techniques. These optimization approaches aimed at improving the quality metrics values of the structure without considering the original package design decisions, often resulting into a totally new software modularization. The entirely changed software modularization becomes costly to realize as well as difficult to understand for the developers/maintainers. To alleviate this issue, we propose a multi-objective optimization approach to improve the modularization quality of an object-oriented system with minimum possible movement of classes between existing packages of original software modularization. The optimization is performed using NSGA-II, a widely-accepted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. In order to ensure minimum modification of original <b>package</b> <b>structure,</b> a new approach of computing class relations using weighted strengths has been proposed here. The weights of relations among different classes are computed on the basis of the original <b>package</b> <b>structure.</b> A new objective function has been formulated using these weighted class relations. This objective function drives the optimization process toward better modularization quality simultaneously ensuring preservation of original structure. To evaluate the results of the proposed approach, a series of experiments are conducted over four real-worlds and two random software applications. The experimental results clearly indicate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the modularization quality of existing <b>package</b> <b>structure</b> by doing very small movement of classes between packages of original software modularization...|$|R
