40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we study}} {{sleeping}} control and <b>power</b> <b>matching</b> {{for a single}} cell in cellular networks with bursty traffic. The base station (BS) sleeps whenever the system is empty, and wakes up when N users are assembled during the sleep period. The service capacity of the BS in the active mode is controlled through adjusting its transmit power. The total power consumption and average delay are analyzed, based on which the impact of parameter N and transmit power on the energy-delay tradeoff is studied. It is shown that given the average traffic load, the more bursty the traffic is, the less the total power is consumed, while the delay performance of more bursty traffic is better only under certain circumstances. The optimal energy-delay tradeoff is then obtained through joint sleeping control and <b>power</b> <b>matching</b> optimization. The relationship between the optimal control parameters and the asymptotic performance are also provided. Moreover, {{the influence of the}} traffic autocorrelation is explored, which shows less impact on the system performance compared with that of the burstiness. Numerical results show the energy saving gain of the joint sleeping control and <b>power</b> <b>matching</b> scheme, as well as the impact of burstiness on the optimal energy-delay tradeoff.

40|$|To {{overcome}} the imbalance between spindle heat generation and dissipation caused by existed spindle cooling strategies, this paper develops a <b>power</b> <b>matching</b> based cooling strategy for motorized spindle unit. Firstly, heat generation, conduction and dissipation are {{considered for the}} modeling of spindle structural heat exchange. This modeling methodology conveys that an operating motorized spindle unit will have satisfactory thermal behaviors only if the supply dissipation powers from recirculation coolants are dynamically and respectively equal to their corresponding heat generation powers (mainly from spindle bearings and motor). Based on this principle, the <b>power</b> <b>matching</b> between spindle heat generations and dissipations is realized by the real-time power estimations of spindle heat sources and the modified constant supply cooling powers strategy. It can be ultimately verified by experiments that the <b>power</b> <b>matching</b> based dissipation strategy is more advantageous than existed spindle cooling strategies in dissipation of spindle heat generations and decrease of thermal errors...|$|E

40|$|Objectives] This paper aims to {{strengthen}} the control effect of propulsion motors and decrease the energy used during actual control procedures.

In the original motor vector efficiency optimization control module, an efficiency optimization control module is added so as to achieve motor efficiency optimization and energy conservation. [Results] MATLAB/Simulink simulation data shows that the efficiency optimization control method is suitable for most conditions. The operation efficiency of the improved motor model is significantly {{higher than that of}} the original motor model, and its dynamic performance is good.

40|$|In series {{connected}} tandem {{solar cells}} the overall current {{at a given}} voltage {{is limited by the}} sub cell producing the least current. Therefore, a so called matching of the sub cells (i. e. adjusting the sub cell thicknesses) is necessary to maximize the output performance. However, the commonly used current-matching of the short-circuit currents does not lead to a maximal output power. The <b>power</b> <b>matching</b> condition, on the other hand, optimizes the output power and can experimentally be accessed by characterizing the cells under systematically varied spectral irradiance, under which the device is (mis) matched in current or power. In order to examine the light induced degradation of a-Si:H/Î¼c-Si:H tandem cells, this characterization method has been applied at different light soaking times. The experiment permits to distinguish between the loss in efficiency due to the change in matching and the degradation of the top-cell,known as the Staebler Wronski Effect. Furthermore, our study reveals an average 3 % higher stabilized efficiency in the <b>power</b> <b>matching</b> condition than under current matching for the examined a-Si:H/Î¼c- Si:H solar cells. The optimized stabilized efficiency is reached at a short-circuit current mismatch of up to 2 mA/cm 2...|$|E

In the proposed model, an N-based sleeping control scheme is considered. Simulation results reveal that, by introducing the cache, the network power and delay can be obviously reduced in different network conditions compared to the scenario without a cache. In addition, we find that a large cache size does not always mean a less network cost because of the more cache power consumption.|$|E

40|$|The book {{stands at}} the {{intersection}} of two topics: the decidability and computational complexity of hybrid logics, and the deductive systems designed for them. Hybrid logics are divided into two groups: standard hybrid logics involving nominals as expressions of a separate sort, and non-standard hybrid logics, which do not involve nominals but whose expressive <b>power</b> <b>matches</b> the expressive <b>power</b> of binder-free standard hybrid logics. The original results of the book are split into two parts. This division reflects the division of the book itself. We can say that the first type of results concern model-theoretic and complexity properties of hybrid logics. Since hybrid logics which we call standard are quite well investigated, our efforts focused on hybrid logics referred to as non­standard in the book.
