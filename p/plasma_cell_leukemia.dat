50|$|There are {{two forms}} of plasma cell leukemia: Primary <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> in which {{patients}} without a history of multiple myeloma present with diagnostically high levels of circulating plasma cells and Secondary <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> in which patients with multiple myeloma suffer their dyscrasia's progression by the expansion {{of large numbers of}} their malignant plasma cells into the circulation and distant tissues. Historically, primary <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> was more common than the secondary form but with the increased survival of multiple myeloma patients due to new treatment regiments, more cases of secondary <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> are occurring; currently, the two forms occur in approximately equal numbers. Patients with primary <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> present with clinical findings that are less commonly found in multiple myeloma, e.g. they often have hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, nerve and central nervous system defects, bleeding tendencies secondary to thrombocytopenia, and pleural effusions. They are less likely than multiple myeloma patients to have lytic bone lesions. In several studies of patients with either form of <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia,</b> the disease was associated with clonal IgG in 28% to 56% of cases, IgA in 4% to 7% of cases, and a light chain in 23% to 44% of cases; 0-12% of patients had no myeloma protein. Medium survival for primary and secondary plasma cell dyscrasias have been 7-13 months and 2-7 months, respectively, but appear to be improving with new treatment regimens.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} report we {{demonstrate}} that the IL- 6 gene is expressed in anti-Ig-activated and neoplastic B cells. After activation with anti-Ig, splenic B cells rapidly expressed IL- 6 mRNA with peak expression occurring at 4 h and declining rapidly thereafter. In an attempt to exclude that the IL- 6 mRNA expression was in non-B cells, T cells and monocytes were extensively depleted. In this highly purified B cell population, IL- 6 mRNA was retained, whereas {{the expression of the}} T cell- and monocyte-restricted CD 2 and CD 14 genes was nearly undetectable. These results are consistent with the conclusion that activated B cells express IL- 6 mRNA. Because we found IL- 6 mRNA expression in normal activated B lymphocytes, we examined the expression of IL- 6 mRNA in B cell neoplasms. 11 of 25 non-Hodgkins B cell lymphomas and 4 of 4 myelomas and <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemias</b> expressed IL- 6 mRNA, whereas only 1 of 19 B <b>cell</b> <b>leukemias</b> was positive. To exclude that IL- 6 mRNA expression in neoplastic B cells was the result of contaminating non-B cells, T cells and monocytes were extensively depleted from the tumor specimens. In the three IL- 6 -positive tumor samples depleted of T cells and monocytes, IL- 6 mRNA expression was retained in all cases. These observations provide support for the idea that the IL- 6 gene is expressed in normal activated and neoplastic B cells...|$|R

Whereas the expression of CD 56 defines a particular subset of myeloma patients, CD 28 is the only antigen for which expression correlates with tumor progression. Our data show that an aggressive compartment of CD 28 + and CD 86 + myeloma cells emerges during the course of MM in vivo, indicating that CD 28 could be aberrantly expressed on highly malignant (possibly mutated) myeloma cells. Conversely, a subset of proliferative plasmablasts coexpressing CD 28 and CD 86 could be the normal counterpart of the clonogenic myeloma stem cell because a subset of CD 28 + <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> was observed in 6 of 6 cases of reactive plasmocytosis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Large-scale genome rearrangements {{brought about}} by {{chromosome}} breaks underlie numerous inherited diseases, initiate or promote many cancers and are also associated with karyotype diversification during species evolution. Recent {{research has shown that}} these breakpoints are nonrandomly distributed throughout the mammalian genome and many, termed "evolutionary breakpoints" (EB), are specific genomic locations that are "reused" during karyotypic evolution. When the phylogenetic trajectory of orthologous chromosome segments is considered, many of these EB are coincident with ancient centromere activity as well as new centromere formation. While EB have been characterized as repeat-rich regions, it has not been determined whether specific sequences have been retained during evolution that would indicate previous centromere activity or a propensity for new centromere formation. Likewise, the conservation of specific sequence motifs or classes at EBs among divergent mammalian taxa has not been determined. Results To define conserved sequence features of EBs associated with centromere evolution, we performed comparative sequence analysis of more than 4. 8 Mb within the tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii, derived from centromeric regions (CEN), euchromatic regions (EU), and an evolutionary breakpoint (EB) that has undergone convergent breakpoint reuse and past centromere activity in marsupials. We found a dramatic enrichment for long interspersed nucleotide elements (LINE 1 s) and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and a depletion of short interspersed nucleotide elements (SINEs) shared between CEN and EBs. We analyzed the orthologous human EB (14 q 32. 33), known to be associated with translocations in many cancers including multiple myelomas and <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemias,</b> and found a conserved distribution of similar repetitive elements. Conclusion Our data indicate that EBs tracked within the class Mammalia harbor sequence features retained since the divergence of marsupials and eutherians that may have predisposed these genomic regions to large-scale chromosomal instability. </p...|$|R

50|$|Smouldering myeloma, {{also known}} as {{smoldering}} myeloma, smoldering multiple myeloma, indolent myeloma or asymptomatic myeloma, is a disease classified as intermediate in a spectrum of step-wise progressive diseases termed plasma cell dyscrasias. In this spectrum of diseases, a clone of plasma cells secreting monoclonal paraprotein (also termed myeloma protein or M protein) causes the relatively benign disease of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. This clone proliferates and may slowly evolve into more aggressive sub-clones that cause smouldering multiple myeloma. Further and more rapid evolution causes the overtly malignant stage of multiple myeloma and can subsequently lead to the extremely malignant stage of secondary <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia.</b> Thus, some patients with smouldering myeloma progress to multiple myeloma and <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia.</b> Smouldering myeloma, however, is not a malignant disease.

Another regimen termed VMCP/VBAP uses alternating vincristine, melphalan (M), cyclophosphamide, prednisone/vincristine, carmustine, doxorubicin, and prednisone polychemotherapy. In general, combination chemotherapy has resulted in median survivals of 18 to 20 months compared to 2 to 6 months when single agent therapy is used. There are anecdotal reports of excellent responses and 2- to 3-year disease-free survivals after autologous stem cell transplantation. Autologous transplantation may increase benefit from conventional therapy and high dose melphalan may prolong progression free and overall survival.|$|E
5000|$|The clonal {{plasma cells}} {{involved}} in plasma cell dyscrasias exhibit {{a high degree}} of genetic instability. For example, the clonal plasma cell population formed by initial genetic alterations that lead to multiple myeloma contains cells that develop further genetic changes that enhance their survival, proliferation, tissue-injuring, and metastatic capacities. This allows the new cell clones to crowd out older cell clones and thereby establish a more malignant disease. Repetition of such genetic changes underlie the evolution of a clinically silent plasma cell dyscrasia to an overt malignancy. The progressive genetic changes in clonal plasma cells include accumulating numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms, increases and decreases in gene and chromosome copy numbers, and chromosomal translocations. Genes affecting include those regulating genome stability itself (e.g. KIF2B) as well as cellular activation, proliferation, and apoptosis (e.g. CIDEC, TP52, ATM, KRAS, NRAS, Wnt, and NF-κB). In the most malignant form of plasma cell dyscrasias, primary <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia,</b> the plasma cell population contains >1900 distinct DNA alterations in >600 genes.|$|E

5000|$|PCL {{is caused}} by the {{development}} of an excessively high number of genetic abnormalities in plasma cells or, more particularly, their precursor B cells and plasmablasts (see plasma cells). This genetic instability is due to a myriad of acquired abnormalities including gene mutations; single nucleotide polymorphisms; depletions and duplications of parts of a gene, larger portion of a chromosome, or even an entire arm of a chromosome; translocations, deletions, and duplications of entire chromosomes; and increases and decreases in the expression of intact genes due to, e.g. the methylation of gene promotors and various less direct effects. These genetic abnormalities effect the Wnt signaling pathway, regulation of the cell cycle, RNA metabolism, protein folding, and cadherin-related cell adherence to extracellular matrix. These effects in turn control plasma cell proliferation, survival, apoptosis, adhesion to bone marrow, genome stability, and secretion of monoclonal immunoglobulins. [...] Secondary <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> (sPCL) results from the comparatively slow development of plasma cell/plasma cell precursor genetic abnormalities which initially create a clone of cells that cause the premalignant condition of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. In {{a very small percentage of}} these cases, the progressive development of further genetic abnormalities serially create a clone(s) of plasma cells that cause the more serious but still premalignant disorder of smoldering multiple myeloma, overt myeloma cancer, and ultimately sPCL. In contrast to sPCL, pPCL presents de novo with a broad range of genetic abnormalities. For example, advanced methods for examining the genome viz., whole-exome sequencing and gene expression profiling, have identified 166 non-silent gene variants per pPCL patient sample at the time of diagnosis. These abnormalities are similar but not identical to those detected in sPCL while the abnormalies detected in sPCL more closely resemble those detected in multiple myeloma than do those of pPCL: the genetic data support the clinical data in suggesting that sPCL and pPCL are distinct diseases with sPCL among the two PCLs being more closely related to multiple myeloma. Examination of plasma cell immunophenotype by measuring certain of their cell surface antigens, particularly Cluster of differentiation. CD markers on plasma cells from patients with pPCL differ from those taken form multiple myeloma or sPCL patients. For example: pPCL plasma cells more often express CD20 antigen, which is considered important in anchoring plasma cells to the bone marrow stroma, than do those on plasma cells taken from myeloma patients (50% vs. 17%); pPCL plasma cells often lack CD56 antigen which is present on the majority of plasma cells taken form multiple myeloma patients; and pPCL plasma cells more frequently express CD28 than do sPCL plasma cells. Thus, immunophenotyping supports that notion that multiple myeloma, sPCL, and pPCL show critically important fundamental differences that may explain their different clinical presentations, courses, responses to therapy, and prognoses.|$|E
5000|$|Plasma {{cells are}} key {{effector}} {{elements of the}} adaptive immune system. They contribute to immunity by making antibodies that bind with and thereby initiate the process of neutralizing specific antigens that usually are found {{on the surface of}} invading pathogens and foreign substances. Plasma cells develop from B lymphocytes which are stimulated to undergo this maturational development by T lymphocytes during the latter cells' processing of these antigens. As they are stimulated to become plasma cells, B cells refashion parts of their genome in efforts to create a new gene that encodes a functional antibody. Antibodies are composed of two identical heavy chains, i.e. either mu (μ), gamma (γ), alpha (α), epsilon (ε), or delta (δ), and two identical light chains, either kappa (κ) or lambda (λ); there are five different classes of antibodies that are named based on their heavy chain content as IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE, or IgD, respectively. Formation of a this new gene requires B cells and/or their descendent plasma cells to make point mutations at a) the immunoglobulin heavy chain antigen-binding locus gene which is on the short arm of human chromosome 14 at position 32.33 (site notated as 14q32.33); b) the immunoglobulin light chain antigen binding locus gene which is on the short arm of chromosome 22 at position 11q.22; and c) other nearby sites. These mutations are made {{in an effort to make}} a gene encoding a protein that binds the instigating antigen. The next step in this new gene formation involves V(D)J recombinations and class switch recombinations, i.e. the deletion and subsequent recombination of various gene segments at the heavy chain locus so that the gene codes for either an IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE, or IgD antibody isotype. If these gene alterations are successful in coding for a functional antibody (Ig), the maturing B cells and to a greater extent their plasma cell descendants make and secrete an intact antibody, initially IgM but after class switch recombinations, either IgG, IgA, IgE, or IgD. However, the cited gene changes can go awry in plasma cells by, for example, placing a gene that ordinarily controls cell growth adjacent to the normally highly active antibody gene promotor thereby creating a cancer-causing oncogene or, more commonly, by forming extra chromosomes (see trisomy) or chromosomes that have deleted or repetitive sections, any of which such changes may promote malignancy in more complex and less well understood ways. These mutations lead to the uncontrolled overproduction of an IgG, IgA, IgE, or IgD antibody, a κ or λ light chain, or, very rarely, an α, γ, or μ heavy chain or fragments of these proteins. The overproduced immunoglobulins, termed myeloma proteins, commonly circulate in blood, may accumulate in urine, and are the hallmarks of plasma cell dyscrasias including their most malignant forms viz., multiple myeloma, light chain multiple myeloma, and <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia.</b> IgG-secretory, IgA-secretory, and light-chain secretory multiple myeloma represent 52%, 21%, 1nd 16%, respectively, of all multiple myeloma cases; these myelomas are associated with various types of chromosomal aberrancies and mutations. IgD-secretory multiple myeloma occurs in only 1% to 2% of multiple myeloma cases and is commonly associated with somatic mutations in the IgV region. IgE-secretory multiple myeloma has been reported in <50 as of 2013 and is characteristically associated with translocations between the long (i.e. [...] "q") arms of chromosome 11 and 14, i.e. t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocations.|$|E

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively studied immunophenotypic profile of 10 cases of <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> (out of 4615 cases of hematolymphoid neoplasms) using five parameter, three color flow cytometric analysis. We also studied their clinical presentation and other laboratory findings. Results: Common clinical features at presentation were weakness, bone pain, anemia, thrombocytopenia and osteolytic lesions. Plasma cell population was identified on strong expression of CD 38 and co-expression of CD 38 and CD 138. CD 56 was expressed in 44 % cases. CD 19 and CD 20 were negative in all cases.

Zinc as a chemical element modulates proliferation and differentiation of cells by affecting several growth factors. Zip 4 modifies zinc metabolism {{in a cell}} as a transporter protein. While high Zip 4 gene expression was found in pancreas and hepatocellular carcinoma, low Zip 4 gene expression was observed in prostate carcinoma. Methods. Here, Zip 4 expression levels were studied in RPMI - 8226 and ARH - 77 cell lines as examples of multiple myeloma and <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia,</b> respectively. Results. We found lower Zip 4 gene expression levels in both cell lines {{than that of the}} normal control (0, 000157 in RPMI - 8226, 0, 000227 in ARH - 77 cell lines and 1 in normal control) The findings were statistically significant (P < 0. 05). The expression levels of Zip 4 gene in both cell lines were approximately similar. No statistical significance was found between the expression levels of Zip 4 in both cell lines (P = 0. 547). Conclusion. The results of this study support the possible role of Zip 4 gene expression in plasma cell dyscrasias. The similar result of Zip 4 gene expression level in both cell lines may show that Zip 4 has no role in the transformation of multiple myeloma to <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia...</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{clinical}} presentation of primary PCL (pPCL) indicates {{a far more}} aggressive disease {{than that of a}} typical multiple myeloma case with its clinical features being a combination of those found in multiple myeloma and acute leukemia. Like multiple myeloma patients, pPCL patients exhibit pathologically high levels of monoclonal <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> in their bone marrow plus a malignant plasma cell-secreted circulating monoclonal myeloma protein, either IgG, IgA, a light chain, or none in 28-56%, 4-7%, 23-44%, or 0-12% of cases, respectively. Similar to B <b>cell</b> <b>leukemias,</b> but unlike multiple myeloma, pPCL patients exhibit relative high frequencies of splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, kidney failure, bone marrow failure (i.e. thrombocytopenia, anemia, and/or, rarely, leukopenia), central nervous system defects, and peripheral neuropathies due to the invasion of these tissues by <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> and/or the deposition of their circulating monoclonal immunoglobulin in them. Compared to multiple myeloma patients, pPCL patients also: exhibit 1) high rates of developing an hypercalcemic crisis, i.e. an potentially life-threatening episode of high ionic calcium (Ca2+) levels in the blood due to excess bone re-absorption and/or renal failure; b) higher levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and Beta-2 microglobulin; and c) lower rates of bone but higher rates of soft tissue <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> tumors termed plasmacytomas.|$|R
50|$|Total serum tryptase is {{elevated}} in mast <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia.</b> Normal total(alpha + beta) serum tryptase {{is approximately}} 6 micro g/L (range 0 to 11 micro g/L). Values {{of several hundred}} micro g/L are characteristic of mast <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia.</b> <b>Plasma</b> and urinary histamine levels are frequently elevated in mast <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia.</b> Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) is the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction which produces histamine from histidine. Measurement of histidine carboxylase in the marrow cells of patients with mast <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> is a very sensitive marker of mast cells.|$|R
