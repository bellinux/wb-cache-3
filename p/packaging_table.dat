40|$|ABSTRACTPersistence of Campylobacter sp and its biofilm {{forming ability}} was {{assessed}} in two poultry abattoirs at two weeks intervals. Average prevalence (63. 75 %) of Campylobacter spp. was observed on assessing {{a total of}} 160 samples collected from the surfaces of <b>packaging</b> <b>table</b> (80 %), dressing table (75 %), floor source (70 %) and washing table (30 %). Biofilm assessment formed by Campylobacter jejuni within 5 -days at 37 °C were in decreasing order of washing table>packaging table>dressing table>floor. An average rate (19. 6 %) of isolates to develop biofilm observed in both sites was considered relatively low. Absorbance value (Optical Density-OD 590 nm) of formed biofilms ranged from 0. 483 – 0. 952. Wastewater from the facilities showed higher TDS (643 – 820 mgl− 1), TSS (1200 – 1775 mgl− 1), COD (152 – 141 mgl− 1) and BOD (30. 3 – 32. 5 mgl− 1) than the WHO standards of 500 mgl− 1, 100 mgl− 1, 10 mgl− 1 and 6 mgl− 1 respectively. This is {{a clear indication of}} heavy microbial presence in the wastewater. Total bacterial count (TBC) was slightly higher in site A (4. 4 × 105 CFU/ml) than site B (3. 5 × 105 CFU/ml). Efficiency index ratio (≈/> 1) observed in all tested drugs suggests their effectiveness in campylobacteriosis management. Decreasing drug sensitivity pedigree was observed with streptomycin>erythromycin & gentamincin>tetracycline & neomycin>penicillin>riphapicin & ampicillin>norflaxicin & cephalexin. These results of frequency and biofilm forming tendencies of Campylobacter spp. observed in this study can be of value in checkmating campybacteriosis outbreak from poultry abattoir facility...|$|E

40|$|Electronics {{capable of}} {{operation}} under extreme temperatures are required {{in many of}} NASA space exploration missions. Aerospace and military applications, {{as well as some}} terrestrial industries constitute environments where electronic systems are anticipated to be exposed to extreme temperatures and wide-range thermal swings. Electronics that are able to withstand and operate efficiently in such harsh environments would simplify, if not eliminate, traditional thermal control elements and their associated structures for proper ambient operation. As a result, overall system mass would be reduced, design would be simplified, and reliability would be improved. Electronic parts that are built utilizing silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology are known to offer better radiation-tolerance compared to their conventional silicon counterparts, provide faster switching, and consume less power. They also exhibit reduced leakage current and, thus, they are often tailored for high temperature operation. These attributes make SOI-based devices suitable for use in harsh environments where extreme temperatures and wide thermal swings are anticipated. A new operational amplifier, based on silicon-on-insulator technology and geared for high temperature well-logging applications, was recently introduced by Honeywell Corporation. This HTOP- 01 dual precision operational amplifier is a low power device, operates on a single supply, and has an internal oscillator and an external clocking option [1]. It is rated for operation from - 55 C to + 225 C with a maximum output current capability of 50 mA.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} selected factors associated with preparing elementary teachers in north Mississippi public schools to work with limited English proficient (LEP) students. The objectives of this research were (a) to determine the awareness of elementary teachers in north Mississippi public schools concerning the legal aspects of teaching limited English proficient students, (b) to ascertain if a need exists to prepare teachers in north Mississippi public schools to work with limited English proficient students, and (c) to identify types of instruction that teachers in north Mississippi public schools would participate in when preparing to work with limited English proficient students. The subjects in this study were elementary teachers from 17 school districts in north Mississippi public schools with an identified LEP student population. A random sample of 344 elementary teachers was chosen to participate in the study in the spring of 1997. The instrument used to gather the data for this study was a questionnaire constructed by the researcher. The questions on the questionnaire were categorized according to demographics, the legal aspects of teaching LEP students, the need to prepare teachers to work with LEP students, types of instruction for preparing teachers to work with LEP students, and a general question related to teaching LEP students.

40|$|Ready-to-eat {{table grapes}} are a product with severe shelf life problems. Mass loss, colour changes, {{accelerated}} softening and mould proliferation can greatly influence quality decay of berries. Hence, {{the effects of}} different dipping treatments {{on the quality of}} <b>packaged</b> ready-to-eat <b>table</b> grapes have been successfully assessed. Various antimicrobial compounds (trans- 2 -hexenal, potassium sorbate, eugenol, cinnamon bark oil and ethanol) were used at different concentrations for dipping grape berries prior to packaging. All the samples were packaged in biaxially oriented polypropylene and stored at (4 ± 1) °C. During the storage period, headspace gas composition, spoilage microorganisms, appearance of visible moulds and sensory quality were monitored. The composition of the headspace gas was typical of a non-climacteric fruit, thus demonstrating that the antimicrobial compounds did not affect product respiration rate. For the entire storage period, the bacterial counts did not grow significantly. On the contrary, mould proliferation on the product surface affected sensory properties until provoking product unacceptability.

40|$|We {{show how}} the fusion rules for an affine Kac-Moody Lie algebra g of type A_n- 1, n = 2 or 3, for all {{positive}} integral level k, {{can be obtained from}} elementary group theory. The orbits of the kth symmetric group, S_k, acting on k-tuples of integers modulo n, Z_n^k, are in one-to-one correspondence with a basis of the level k fusion algebra for g. If [a],[b],[c] are any three orbits, then S_k acts on T([a],[b],[c]) = (x,y,z) ∈ [a]x[b]x[c] such that x+y+z= 0, which decomposes into a finite number, M([a],[b],[c]), of orbits under that action. Let N = N([a],[b],[c]) denote the fusion coefficient associated with that triple of elements of the fusion algebra. For n = 2 we prove that M([a],[b],[c]) = N, and for n = 3 we prove that M([a],[b],[c]) = N(N+ 1) / 2.
