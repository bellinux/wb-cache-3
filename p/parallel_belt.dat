40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of a controller used to synchronize two <b>parallel</b> <b>belt</b> conveyors in a packaging plant. A first conveyor carries the products, while the second delivers the packages. The insertion is obtained by a proper mechanical action. The control system {{is based on a}} 'hybrid' fuzzy logic controller, whose parameters are optimized by using an advanced 'operational' genetic algorithm. 'Hybrid' means that a conventional fuzzy logic controller is integrated with a set of special rules needed to solve particular situations characterizing the system. An important constraint is given, since the physical structure of the existing control system is to be kept unchanged. It is shown that the controller efficiently governs the belt conveyors when: (a) the distances between goods and the relative packages become higher than a certain value; (b) the performance of the electrical engine deteriorates during working time; and also (c) interference phenomena occur between consecutive good-package couples...|$|E

40|$|The ~ 750 km 2 Dayman {{dome of the}} Late Cretaceous Suckling Dayman massif, eastern Papua New Guinea, is a domed landform {{that rises}} to an {{elevation}} of 2850 m. The northern edge of the dome is a fault scarp > 1000 m high that {{is now part of}} an active microplate boundary separating continental crust of the New Guinea highlands from continental and oceanic crust of the Woodlark microplate. Previous work has shown that a <b>parallel</b> <b>belt</b> of eclogite-bearing core complexes north-east of the Dayman dome were exhumed from up to 24 – 28 kbar in the last few millions of years. The remarkably fresh and lightly eroded scarp of the Dayman dome exposes shallowly-dipping mylonitic (S 1) metabasite rocks (500 m thick) on the northern flank of Mount Dayman. Field relationships near the base of this scarp show a cross cutting suite of ductile and brittle meso-structures that includes: (i) rare ductile S 2 folia with a shallowly ESE-plunging mineral elongation lineation defined by sodic-calcic blue amphibole; (ii) narrow steeply-dipping ductile D 2 shear zones; and (iii) semi-brittle to brittle fault zones. Pumpellyite-actinolite facies assemblages reported by previous workers to contain local aragonite, lawsonite and⁄or glaucophane are found in the core of the complex at elevations greater than 2000 m. These assemblages indicate peak metamorphic pressures of 6 – 9. 5 kbar, demonstrating exhumation of the core of the Dayman dome from depths of 20 – 30 km. The S 1 metamorphic mineral assemblage in metabasite includes actinolite-chlorite-epidote-albite-quartz-calcite-titanite, indicative of greenschist facies conditions for the main deformation. New mineral equilibria modelling suggests that this S 1 assemblage evolved at 5. 9 – 7. 2 kbar at ~ 425 oC. Modelling variable Fe 3 + indicates that the sodic-calcic blue amphibole (D 2) formed under a higher oxidation state compared with the S 1 assemblage, probably at 20 km depth. Exhumation of this foliation must therefore be controlled by brittle faults of the active microplate boundary that are largely not observed in the study area. The structural record of the final exhumation of the Dayman dome to the surface was likely lost as a result of erosion, poor exposure or wide spacing of semi-brittle to brittle fault zones...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the adaptability of a biped robot controlled by nonlinear oscillators with phase resetting based on central pattern generators, {{we examined the}} walking behavior of a biped robot on a splitbelt treadmill that has two <b>parallel</b> <b>belts</b> controlled independently. In an experiment, we demonstrated the dynamic interactions among the robot mechanical system, the oscillator control system, and the environment. The robot produced stable walking on the splitbelt treadmill at various belt speeds without changing the control strategy and parameters, despite a large discrepancy between the belt speeds. This is due to modulation of the locomotor rhythm and its phase through the phase resetting mechanism, which induces the relative phase between leg movements to shift from antiphase, and causes the duty factors to be autonomously modulated depending on the speed discrepancy between the belts. Such shifts of the relative phase and modulations of the duty factors are observed during human splitbelt treadmill walking. Clarifying the mechanisms producing such adaptive splitbelt treadmill walking {{will lead to a}} better understanding of the phase resetting mechanism in the generation of adaptive locomotion in biological systems and consequently to a guiding principle for designing control systems for legged robots...|$|R

40|$|Early post-collision Variscan {{magmatism}} in Corsica, France was characterised by high-K granitic intrusions of Namurian age. They {{consist of}} quartz-monzonites, monzogranites and leuco-monzogranites associated with vaugnerite (meladiorites or hornblende–biotite diorites) intrusive stocks and enclaves. The {{composition of the}} vaugnerites shows that they originated from slowly cooled syn-magmatically amphibolitized lamprophyric magmas probably derived from enriched mantle melts that were injected into the lower crust and contributed to its extensive anatexis giving the high-K granitic melts.

The granitoid suite is characterised by: high K and Mg contents; relatively high concentrations of Th, Rb, Sr and Ba; (La/Yb) N from 10 to 20; LREE enrichments (LaN≈ 100 – 300); Sri≈ 0. 707; δ 18 O≈ 6; εNd≈− 3. 5 to − 2. 5.

40|$|Two {{apparently}} distinct, sub-parallel, paleo-subduction zones can {{be recognized}} {{along the northern}} margin of the Tibetan Plateau: the North Qilian Suture Zone (oceanic-type) with ophiolitic mélanges and high-pressure eclogites and blueschists in the north, and the North Qaidam Belt (continental-type) in the south, an ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphic terrane comprising pelitic and granitic gneisses, eclogites and garnet peridotites. Eclogites from both belts have protoliths broadly similar to mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) or oceanic island basalts (OIB) in composition with overlapping metamorphic ages (480 – 440 Ma, with weighted mean ages of 464 6 Ma for North Qilian and 457 7 Ma for North Qaidam), determined by zircon U–Pb sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe dating. Coesite-bearing zircon grains in pelitic gneisses from the North Qaidam UHP Belt yield a peak meta-morphic age of 423 6 Ma, 40 Myr younger than the age of eclogite formation, and a retrograde age of 403 9 Ma. These data, combined with regional relationships, allow us to infer that these two <b>parallel</b> <b>belts</b> may represent an evolutionary sequence from oceanic subduction to continental collision, and continental under-thrusting, to final exhumation.

40|$|Abstract. Rooted listric low-angle normal faults (< 20 o) of {{regional}} extent {{have been recognized}} widely {{in the past few}} years in the North American Cordillera and else-where. The low-angle geometry of these crustal-scale nor-mal faults conflicts with Anderson's [1942] classic theory of faulting. In that theory the orientations of principal stresses are assumed to be vertical and horizontal; the predicted dip angle of normal faults is about 60 o rather than 20 o or less. Recent geological and geophysical stud-ies in the mid-Tertiary extensional terrane of southeast-ern California and western Arizona suggest that thick my-lonitic gneisses in the lower plates of low-angle detachment faults may represent unidirectionally sheared laminar flow in and below the midcrust. Directed ductile flow, possibly related to the gravitational spreading of thickened lower crust, may induce a shearing traction on the horizontal or subhorizontal base of the brittle upper crust. Thus the ori-entations of the principal stresses can no longer be vertical and horizontal at this interface. A simple elastic model in-corporates the effect of basal shearing due to gravitational spreading on stress distributions in an elastic upper crust. This model shows that <b>parallel</b> <b>belts</b> of compression and extension can be produced if a shearing traction acting on the base of the elastic upper crust is considered. In partic-ular, appropriate stress conditions for the formation of re-gional ow-angle normal faults (< 20 ø) can be produced by the superposition of two stress fields: a basal shear stress field induced by the basal shear traction and a contrac-tional stress field in which the horizontal deviatoric stress is compressional and the vertical gradient of the horizon-tal normal stress component is constant. This superposed stress field may represent a tectonic setting where a stres...|$|R

In uplift since the Cenozoic time, the Himalaya is traditionally divided into six lithotectonic zones extending in <b>parallel</b> <b>belts.</b> From north to south there are respectively: (1) the Trans-Himalayan batholith; (2) the Indus-Tsangpo suture zone; (3) the Tethyan (Tibetan) Himalaya; (4) the Higher (Greater) Himalaya; (5) the Lesser Himalaya; and (6) the Sub-Himalaya. This PhD thesis is focused on the Tethyan sedimentary rocks exposed in the Nepal Tethyan Himalaya belt and in the thrusting nappes belonging to the Lesser Himalaya. These nappes contain unmetamorphosed sedimentary rocks which might belong to the Tethyan sedimentary succession. The Tethyan Himalaya has preserved highly fossiliferous marine rocks deposited on the shelf and slope of the Indian continental margin from Late Proterozoic-Cambrian through early Eocene times. The main objective of this PhD thesis is to build a first sedimentological canvas for the Lower Paleozoic and Devonian carbonated rocks of Nepal which could be compared with the Belgian facies. This long distance comparison between the Belgian and the Nepalese basins will allow to have a better understanding of the phenomena that run the global carbonate sedimentation. The methods that will be used to achieve this work are: (1) bed by bed sampling; (2) petrographic analysis and facies modelling; (3) magnetic susceptibility analysis for correlations and eustatism and (4) paleontological datation.
