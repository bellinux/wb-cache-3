40|$|Domestic service {{historically}} in Mexico {{has been}} a major employer of women; in 1980, approximately one of every six working women was a <b>private</b> <b>household</b> <b>worker.</b> Private household employment is largely an urban occupation, and the nation 2 ̆ 7 s capital, Mexico City, has generated much of the demand for domestic service. As elsewhere in Latin America, most private household workers are young, single female migrants women from rural areas. ^ This study examines the history and present conditions of female domestic service in the Mexico City metropolitan area. In so doing, it focuses on various interrelated questions. First, it attempts to establish the role of domestic service in the process of Mexican development; it examines the economic, social, and political significance of this occupation. Secondly, this research addresses the relationship between domestic service and social reproduction. Thirdly, it describes and analyzes female domestic workers 2 ̆ 7 socioeconomic origins and demographic characteristics, as well as their labor and general living conditions. Fourthly, the influence of these combined factors in the configuration of their consciousness and identity is a related area of research. Finally, the different policies and programs concerning domestic service that have been formulated by the government, the Church, and the feminist Left are analyzed in terms of their goals, operation, and importance. ^ Given its objectives, this study draws upon historical and anthropological methodologies. Documentary and field research was carried out in the Mexico City area during various phases between 1977 and 1985. ^ The findings indicate that female domestic service has declined in relative terms over the twentieth century. Concomitantly, the conditions of domestic service themselves have changed; most notably, there have been transformations in the labor process, a shift towards live-out employment, and a trend towards a more contractual relationship. ...|$|E

40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the labor force}} position of Latina and Latino immigrants in California. There has been considerable immigration from Latin America throughout the 20 th century, with much of this migration coming from Mexico. In the last 20 years, immigration from Central and South America has increased significantly. How immigrants from Mexico and other Latin American countries fare in the U. S. economic system is a critical research and policy issue. Prior research points to the particular low status position of Latino immigrants {{in the labor force}} (Morales and Ong, 1993). Immigrants are typically concentrated in low wage manufacturing jobs, particularly in the garment, plastic, and furniture industries, as well as in low level service jobs, such as restaurant <b>workers,</b> janitors, and <b>private</b> <b>household</b> <b>workers.</b> Overall, it was found that individual factors—especially education and English language ability—were important in explaining the especially disadvantaged position of non-citizen immigrants. Moreover, individual and structural factors had a strong direct effect on the labor position {{for both men and women}} while family characteristics were more important for Latinas than Latinos. We found that gender differences in labor force position were pervasive, with Latinas consistently in a lower status position than their male counterparts. These findings suggest a number of policies that could be implemented to assist in improving the labor position of Latinos and Latinas...|$|R
40|$|In {{general the}} Netherlands is {{performing}} relatively well {{in terms of}} combatting {{trafficking in human beings}} (THB). Yet, the Dutch government still needs to make considerable effort to address the demand-side of THB and to take action in relation to forms of exploitation outside the sex industry. While generally attention for labour exploitation is on the increase, sector-specific attention is still required. The domestic work sector has been considered a risk sector for exploitation since 2008, yet attention for this sector remains scarce. Because the work takes place in the <b>private</b> <b>household,</b> domestic <b>workers</b> are in a vulnerable and isolated position and are therefore in need of specific attention to avoid exploitation. At the same time, the fact that the work takes place in the private realm and that the group of domestic workers is diverse poses serious challenges for the Dutch Government to tackle this particular form of labour exploitation. This report seeks to provide general insight into THB in DW in the Netherlands with special attention for demand side aspects, in order propose recommendations to the Dutch Government how it could step up its efforts to tackle THB in DW. This project has received funding from the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration under Grant Agreement No. 612869...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] Enhancing our {{knowledge}} on domestic work lays a solid basis for action {{that can make}} a difference in the lives of domestic workers. For too long, this group – a large majority of whom are women – has remained outside the realm of policy-making on social and labour issues, and has largely been confined to the informal economy. Since they work behind the closed doors of <b>private</b> <b>households,</b> domestic <b>workers</b> are shielded from public view and attention, and are often hard to reach by conventional policy tools. However, this should not be used as a convenient excuse for inaction. In the words of the ILO’s Director-General, “[t]he ILO’s mandate requires it to reach out to those who are most vulnerable, who face great insecurity and for whom the denial of social justice is most cruel”. Numbering at least 53 million, domestic workers are one group of workers that deserve our attention. In an unprecedented manner, this report attempts to capture the size of the domestic work sector and the extent of legal protection enjoyed by domestic workers on the basis of a verifiable and replicable methodology. Its findings contribute to overcoming the invisibility of domestic workers and carry a powerful message: domestic work represents a significant share of global wage employment, but domestic workers remain to a large extent excluded from the scope of labour laws and hence from legal protection enjoyed by other workers. Marginalization and exclusion is a theme that runs through the findings of this report. For instance – more than half of all domestic workers have no statutory limitation of their weekly working hours, more than two out of five are not entitled to be paid a minimum wage, and more than a third have no right to take maternity leave. From a human rights and gender equality perspective, this is inacceptable...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{developed}} a methodology for classifying workers into {{formal and informal}} employment using the 2005 Bangladesh Labor Force Survey (LFS). Although the 2005 LFS was not designed to collect data for this purpose, it included questions {{that can be used}} to determine whether workers are engaged in formal or informal employment. However, the process of identifying the combination of questions that could distinguish between formal and informal workers was hampered by data inconsistencies that were probably brought about by limitations in data processing and validation. Because 3 years have already passed since data processing was done, the most workable approach was to determine which workers are under formal employment, and to assume that the remaining workers are engaged informally. Results show that 87. 71 % of the workers in Bangladesh are under informal employment. The highest concentration of informal workers is found in the rural areas (92 %). Workers engaged in informal employment are mostly in agriculture; hunting and forestry; wholesale and retail trade; manufacturing; and transport, storage, and communications sectors. On the other hand, formal workers are primarily employed by the government. Women (91. 3 %) are most likely to be engaged in informal employment than men (86. 6 %); and women are generally unpaid family workers and in the <b>private</b> <b>household</b> sector. <b>Workers</b> under formal employment are paid better than those under informal arrangements. For each sector, wage differentials between formal and informal workers are significant. Informal workers are found to have significantly less benefits than those with formal employment, except for free meals and free lodging. In particular, self-employed and unpaid workers comprise a little over 20 million of informal workers, although less than 2 million of them enjoy benefits.

Fieldwork {{was carried out in}} Leicestershire, Lambeth and Sheffield between August 2010 and April 2011. The specific objectives of the study were: to identify a representative group of adults with learning disabilities who were either: (a) living in <b>private</b> <b>households</b> but not able to participate in the APMS 2007 due to learning disability; or (b) living in communal care establishments and thus not covered in the APMS 2007 sample; to interview the adults with learning disabilities living in <b>private</b> <b>households</b> who {{would not have been able}} to take part in the APMS 2007 with two clinical assessments for autism (depending on ability level) - module 1 or module 4 of the Autism Diagnostic Interview Schedule (ADOS); to interview carers of a sub-sample of adults with learning disabilities with two validated clinical assessments to calibrate module 1 of the ADOS; to combine the acquired prevalence rates of autism in adults with learning disabilities who live in <b>private</b> <b>households</b> and who live in communal care establishments with the prevalence of autism in adults without learning disabilities living in <b>private</b> <b>households</b> (from the APMS 2007) to derive an overall prevalence estimate for autism among adults; to perform sensitivity analyses of the combined prevalence estimate to take into account adults without learning disability who live in communal care establishments.; The main APMS 2007 study is held at the UK Data Archive under SN 6379.

Using an example, we demonstrate how different definitions of <b>private</b> <b>household</b> (and different household compositions) affect the socio-economic status and income of the household. Ultimately, a variation in the definition of <b>private</b> <b>household</b> is enough to raise or lower the national poverty line. Our findings lead us to propose that "private household" be operationalised across countries in a way that guarantees that persons can be unequivocally assigned to households on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we examine changes in the {{proportion}} of older widowed and divorced women in England and Wales moving from “independent” to two kinds of “supported” household–supported <b>private</b> <b>households</b> and institutions–during the decades 1971 – 81 and 1981 – 91. Our main aim was to see whether observed increases in institutionalisation over this period were the result of a decreased propensity to move to the households of relatives. We used the ONS Longitudinal Study, a record linkage study including individual level data from the 1971, 1981 and 1991 censuses of England and Wales. A multinomial logit model was used to investigate the correlates of transitions from independent to supported <b>private</b> <b>households</b> versus institutions among elderly widowed and divorced women. While the overall rate of transitions to join either supported <b>private</b> <b>households</b> or institutions was largely the same in the two decades, the balance between the two shifted markedly in favour of transitions to institutions.

40|$|Service {{provider}} {{costs for}} vaccine delivery {{have been well}} documented; however, vaccine recipients' costs have drawn less attention. This research explores the <b>private</b> <b>household</b> out-of-pocket and opportunity costs incurred to receive free oral cholera vaccine during a mass vaccination campaign in rural Odisha, India. Following a government-driven oral cholera mass vaccination campaign targeting population over one year of age, a questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey was conducted to estimate <b>private</b> <b>household</b> costs among vaccine recipients. The questionnaire captured travel costs as well as time and wage loss for self and accompanying persons. The productivity loss was estimated using three methods: self-reported, government defined minimum daily wages and gross domestic product per capita in Odisha. On average, families were located 282. 7 (SD = 254. 5) meters from the nearest vaccination booths. Most family members either walked or bicycled to the vaccination sites and spent on average 26. 5 minutes on travel and 15. 7 minutes on waiting. Depending upon the methodology, the estimated productivity loss due to potential foregone income ranged from $ 0. 15 to $ 0. 29 per dose of cholera vaccine received. The <b>private</b> <b>household</b> cost of receiving oral cholera vaccine constituted 24. 6 % to 38. 0 % of overall vaccine delivery costs. The <b>private</b> <b>household</b> costs resulting from productivity loss for receiving a free oral cholera vaccine is a substantial proportion of overall vaccine delivery cost and may influence vaccine uptake.
