2500|$|Since then, {{coal gas}} has almost {{completely}} {{been replaced by}} natural gas as a fuel, and coal tar as a material for paving roads {{has been replaced by}} the <b>petroleum</b> product <b>asphalt.</b> Naturally occurring bitumen is chemically more similar to asphalt than to coal tar, and the term oil sands (or oilsands) is more commonly used by industry in the producing areas than tar sands because synthetic oil is manufactured from the bitumen, and due to the feeling that the terminology of tar sands is less politically acceptable to the public.

50|$|The {{origin of}} The Pitch Lake {{is related to}} deep faults in {{connection}} with subduction under the Caribbean Plate related to Barbados Arc. The lake has not been studied extensively, but {{it is believed that}} the lake is at the intersection of two faults, which allows oil from a deep deposit to be forced up. The lighter elements in the oil evaporate under the hot tropical sun, leaving behind the heavier asphalt. Bacterial action on the asphalt at low pressures creates <b>petroleum</b> in <b>asphalt.</b> The researchers indicated that extremophiles inhabited the asphalt lake in populations ranging between 106 to 107 cells/gram. The Pitch Lake is one of several natural asphalt lakes in the world.

30|$|To date, the {{utilization}} of mineral (<b>asphalt,</b> <b>petroleum</b> coke, and coal) as an AC precursor has become increasingly valuable for its rich storage, low cost, and high carbon content [5, 6]. A high additional value can be acquired with further use of AC. Chemical activation using alkali (NaOH and KOH) has been widely applied for the preparation of AC, which can result in carbons with high specific surface areas and electrochemical double layer (EDL) capacitance [7 – 10]. However, for the conventional AC, specific capacitance and energy density are rather limited because the energy storage mechanism is onefold EDL capacitance.|$|R

The study provides a theory basis for the possibility of partially replacing <b>petroleum</b> <b>asphalt</b> with botanic asphalt.

6000|$|It now {{turns out}} that the Pitch Lake, like most other things, owes its {{appearance}} on the surface to no convulsion or vagary at all, but to a most slow, orderly, and respectable process of nature, by which buried vegetable matter, which would have become peat, and finally brown coal, in a temperate climate, becomes, under the hot tropic soil, asphalt and oil, continually oozing up beneath the pressure of the strata above it. Such, at least, is the opinion of Messrs. Wall and Sawkins, the geological surveyors of Trinidad, and of several chemists whom they quote; and I am bound to say, that all I saw at the lake and elsewhere, during two separate visits, can be easily explained on their hypothesis, and that no other possible cause suggests itself as yet. The same cause, it may be, has produced the submarine spring of petroleum, off the shore near Point Rouge, where men can at times skim the floating oil off the surface of the sea; the <b>petroleum</b> and <b>asphalt</b> of the Windward Islands and of Cuba, especially the well-known Barbadoes tar; and the petroleum springs of the mainland, described by Humboldt, at Truxillo, in the Gulf of Cumana; and 'the inexhaustible deposits of mineral pitch in the provinces of Merida and Coro, and, above all, in that of Maracaybo.
