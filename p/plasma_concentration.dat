5|$|The H2-receptor {{antagonist}} cimetidine causes {{an increase}} in the <b>plasma</b> <b>concentration</b> of metformin, by reducing clearance of metformin by the kidneys; both metformin and cimetidine are cleared from the body by tubular secretion, and both, particularly the cationic (positively charged) form of cimetidine, may compete for the same transport mechanism.

5|$|Psilocybin is metabolized {{mostly in}} the liver. As it becomes {{converted}} to psilocin, it undergoes a first-pass effect, whereby its concentration is greatly reduced before it reaches the systemic circulation. Psilocin is broken down by the enzyme monoamine oxidase to produce several metabolites that can circulate in the blood plasma, including 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetaldehyde, 4-hydroxytryptophol, and 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid. Some psilocin is not broken down by enzymes and instead forms a glucuronide; this is a biochemical mechanism animals use to eliminate toxic substances by linking them with glucuronic acid, which can then be excreted in the urine. Psilocin is glucuronated by the glucuronosyltransferase enzymes UGT1A9 in the liver, and by UGT1A10 in the small intestine. Based on studies using animals, about 50% of ingested psilocybin is absorbed through the stomach and intestine. Within 24hours, about 65% of the absorbed psilocybin is excreted into the urine, and a further 15–20% is excreted in the bile and feces. Although {{most of the remaining}} drug is eliminated in this way within 8hours, it is still detectable in the urine after 7days. Clinical studies show that psilocin concentrations in the plasma of adults average about 8µg/liter within 2hours after ingestion of a single 15mg oral psilocybin dose; psychological effects occur with a blood <b>plasma</b> <b>concentration</b> of 4–6µg/liter.

25|$|After intra-muscular {{administration}} of Parecoxib sodium peak <b>plasma</b> <b>concentration</b> is reached within 15 minutes.

On the other hand, when Valdecoxib is taken orally it is absorbed rapidly (1–2 hours), but presence of food can delay peak serum concentration.

40|$|The {{research}} in this thesis involved four studies of the variability in <b>plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> and effects of a selection of drugs used in schizophrenia, cardiac surgery and palliative care. 1. Fluphenazine study Steady-state pre-dose <b>plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> of fluphenazine were measured using a gas chromatography I mass spectrometry assay in 24 patients with schizophrenia who were receiving continuous treatment with depot intramuscular fluphenazine decanoate. Clinical response was measured using the Andreasen Scale for positive and negative symptoms. Poorer clinical control was related to higher log transformed <b>plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> of fluphenazine and higher fluphenazine decanoate dosage. The log transformed <b>plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> of fluphenazine and the fluphenazine decanoate dosages were weakly related. These results indicated the useful role that plasma level monitoring can fulfill in identifying patients who are therapy-resistant despite optimal or high plasma levels. 2. CPB study This study examined the effect of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery on the total and unbound <b>plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> of fentanyl and the total <b>plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> of alcuronium in sixteen patients. Due to {{the large number of}} factors which may affect pharmacokinetics during CPB, the results were difficult to deal with mathematically. Despite marked declines in the <b>plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> of both drugs on initiation of CPB, suitable <b>plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> for anaesthesia were maintained throughout the procedure. 3. Subcutaneous fentanyl This study investigated the steady-state total and unbound <b>plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> of fentanyl during continuous subcutaneous administration in 20 palliative care patients. Infusion rates and both total and unbound <b>plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> of fentanyl were correlated. Even with standardisation for dosage, there was an 8 -fold variation in total <b>plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> and a 3. 5 -fold variation in unbound <b>plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> of fentanyl. There was considerable inter-patient variability in the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl with subcutaneous infusion in the palliative care setting, which necessitated careful titration of dosage according to individual clinical response. 4. Nebulised morphine trial The final study involved a trial of nebulised morphine for dyspnoea in eleven palliative care patients. Due to patient attrition and the resulting small sample size, a significant improvement in respiratory function and assessment of dyspnoea could not be found overall. Individual patients, however, reported an improvement in their symptoms.

Vemurafenib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits mutated serine/threonine protein kinase B-Raf (BRAF) and is approved for the treatment of adult patients with BRAF V 600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish the relationship between dried blood spot (DBS) and <b>plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> of vemurafenib to enable the use of DBS sampling, which is a minimally invasive form of sample collection. In total, 43 paired plasma and DBS samples (in duplicate) were obtained from 8 melanoma patients on vemurafenib therapy and were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. <b>Plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> were predicted from the DBS concentrations using 2 methods: (1) individual hematocrit correction and blood cell-to-plasma partitioning and (2) the calculated slope explaining the relationship between DBS and <b>plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> (without individual hematocrit correction). Vemurafenib DBS <b>concentrations</b> and <b>plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> showed a strong correlation (r = 0. 964), and the relationship could be described by ([vemurafenib]plasma = [vemurafenib]DBS / 0. 64).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Higher <b>plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> of catecholamines {{in winter}} than in summer have been established, but whether this impacts the <b>plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> of metanephrines {{used for the}} {{diagnosis}} of pheochromocytoma is unknown. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we examined seasonal variations in the <b>plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> of metanephrines, {{the impact of this}} on diagnostic test performance and the influences of forearm warming ('arterialization' of venous blood) on blood flow and measured concentrations. METHODS: The measurements of the <b>plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> of metanephrines were recorded from 4052 patients tested for pheochromocytoma at two clinical centers. Among these patients, 107 had tumors. An additional 26 volunteers were enrolled for the measurements of plasma metanephrines and forearm blood flow before and after forearm warming. RESULTS: There was no seasonal variation in the <b>plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> of metanephrines among patients with pheochromocytoma, whereas among those without tumors, the <b>plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> of normetanephrine were higher (P< 0. 0001) in winter than in summer. Lowest concentrations of normetanephrine were measured in July, with those recorded from December to April being more than 21 % higher (P< 0. 0001). These differences resulted in a twofold higher (P= 0. 0012) prevalence of false-positive elevations of normetanephrine concentrations in winter than in summer, associated with a drop in overall diagnostic specificity from 96 % in summer to 92 % in winter (P= 0. 0010). Forearm warming increased blood flow and lowered (P= 0. 0020) <b>plasma</b> normetanephrine <b>concentrations.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The <b>plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> of normetanephrine are subject to seasonal variation with a resulting higher prevalence of false-positive results in winter than in summer. Lowered <b>plasma</b> <b>concentrations</b> of normetanephrine with forearm warming suggest an effect of temperature.
