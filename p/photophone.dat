5|$|Seeking a {{customer}} for <b>Photophone,</b> in late 1927 David Sarnoff, then {{general manager of}} RCA, approached Joseph P. Kennedy about using the system for Kennedy's modest-sized studio, Film Booking Offices of America (FBO). Negotiations resulted in General Electric acquiring a substantial interest in FBO—Sarnoff had apparently already conceived of {{a plan for the}} company to attain a central position in the film industry, maximizing <b>Photophone</b> revenue. Next on the agenda was securing a string of exhibition venues like those the leading Hollywood production companies owned. Kennedy began investigating the possibility of such a purchase. Around that time, the large Keith-Albee-Orpheum (KAO) circuit of theaters, built around the then-fading medium of live vaudeville, was attempting a transition to the movie business. In mid-1927, the filmmaking operations of Pathé Exchange and Cecil B. De Mille's Producers Distributing Corporation (PDC) had united under KAO's control. Early in 1928, KAO general manager John J. Murdock, who had assumed the presidency of Pathé, turned to Kennedy as an adviser in consolidating the studio with De Mille's company, PDC. This was the relationship Sarnoff and Kennedy sought.|$|E
5|$|RKO Pictures Inc., {{also known}} as RKO Radio Pictures and in its later years RKO Teleradio Pictures, was an American film {{production}} and distribution company. It {{was one of the}} Big Five studios of Hollywood's Golden Age. The business was formed after the Keith-Albee-Orpheum (KAO) vaudeville theatre circuit and Joseph P. Kennedy's Film Booking Offices of America (FBO) studio were brought together {{under the control of the}} Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in October 1928. RCA chief David Sarnoff engineered the merger to create a market for the company's sound-on-film technology, RCA <b>Photophone.</b> By the mid-1940s, the studio was under the control of investor Floyd Odlum.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Willoughby Smith {{found that}} the {{electrical}} resistance of grey selenium was dependent on the ambient light. This led to its use as a cell for sensing light. The first commercial products using selenium were developed by Werner Siemens in the mid-1870s. The selenium cell {{was used in the}} <b>photophone</b> developed by Alexander Graham Bell in 1879. Selenium transmits an electric current proportional to the amount of light falling on its surface. This phenomenon was used in the design of light meters and similar devices. Selenium's semiconductor properties found numerous other applications in electronics. The development of selenium rectifiers began during the early 1930s, and these replaced copper oxide rectifiers because they were more efficient. These lasted in commercial applications until the 1970s, following which they were replaced with less expensive and even more efficient silicon rectifiers.|$|E
50|$|Mims {{also built}} and {{provided}} a pair of modern hand-held battery-powered LED transceivers connected by 100 yd of optical fiber. The Bell Labs' Richard Gundlach and the Smithsonian's Elliot Sivowitch used the device at the commemoration to demonstrate one of the <b>photophone's</b> modern-day descendants. The National Geographic Society also mounted a special educational exhibit in its Explorer's Hall, highlighting the <b>photophone's</b> invention with original items borrowed from the Smithsonian Institution.|$|R
5000|$|The {{telephone}} {{itself was}} still {{something of a}} novelty, and radio was decades away from commercialization. The social resistance to the <b>photophone's</b> futuristic form of communications {{could be seen in}} an August 1880 New York Times commentary: ...|$|R

5|$|In October 1927, Warner Bros. {{released}} The Jazz Singer, {{the first}} feature-length talking picture. Its success prompted Hollywood {{to convert from}} silent to sound film production en masse. The Radio Corporation of America (RCA) controlled an advanced optical sound-on-film system, RCA <b>Photophone,</b> recently developed by General Electric. However, its hopes of joining in the anticipated boom in sound movies faced a major hurdle: Warner Bros. and Fox, Hollywood's other vanguard sound studios, were already financially and technologically aligned with ERPI, a subsidiary of AT's Western Electric division. The industry's two largest major studios, Paramount and Loew's/MGM, with two other studios Universal and First National, were poised to contract with ERPI for sound conversion as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of commercial sound cinema had proceeded {{in fits and}} starts before The Jazz Singer, and the film's success did not change things overnight. Not until May 1928 did the group of four big studios (PDC had dropped out of the alliance), along with United Artists and others, sign with ERPI for conversion of production facilities and theaters for sound film. Initially, all ERPI-wired theaters were made Vitaphone-compatible; most were equipped to project Movietone reels as well. However, even with access to both technologies, most of the Hollywood companies remained slow to produce talking features of their own. No studio besides Warner Bros. released even a part-talking feature until the low-budget-oriented Film Booking Offices of America (FBO) premiered The Perfect Crime on June 17, 1928, eight months after The Jazz Singer. FBO had come under the effective control of a Western Electric competitor, General Electric's RCA division, which was looking to market its new sound-on-film system, <b>Photophone.</b> Unlike Fox-Case's Movietone and De Forest's Phonofilm, which were variable-density systems, <b>Photophone</b> was a variable-area system—a refinement in the way the audio signal was inscribed on film that would ultimately become the standard. (In both sorts of systems, a specially-designed lamp, whose exposure to the film is determined by the audio input, is used to record sound photographically as a series of minuscule lines. In a variable-density process, the lines are of varying darkness; in a variable-area process, the lines are of varying width.) By October, the FBO-RCA alliance would lead to the creation of Hollywood's newest major studio, RKO Pictures.|$|E
5|$|After an aborted {{attempt by}} Kennedy to bring yet another studio that {{had turned to}} him for help, First National Pictures, into the <b>Photophone</b> fold, RCA was ready to step back in: the company {{acquired}} Kennedy's stock in both FBO and the KAO theater business. On October 23, 1928, RCA announced {{the creation of the}} Radio-Keith-Orpheum holding company, with Sarnoff as chairman of the board. Kennedy, who withdrew from his executive positions in the merged companies, kept Pathé separate from RKO and under his personal control. RCA owned the governing stock interest in RKO, 22 percent; in the early 1930s, RCA's share of stock in the company rose as high as 60 percent. The company's production and distribution arm, presided over by former FBO vice-president Joseph I. Schnitzer, was incorporated early in 1929 as Radio Pictures. Looking {{to get out of the}} film business the following year, Kennedy arranged in late 1930 for RKO to purchase Pathé from him.|$|E
50|$|In 1880, Bell and {{co-inventor}} Charles Sumner Tainter {{conducted the}} world's first wireless telephone call via modulated lightbeams projected by <b>photophones.</b> The scientific principles of their invention {{would not be}} utilized for several decades, {{when they were first}} deployed in military and fiber-optic communications.|$|R
5|$|The {{agreement}} did {{not resolve}} all the patent disputes, and further negotiations were undertaken and concords signed {{over the course}} of the 1930s. During these years, as well, the American studios began abandoning the Western Electric system for RCA <b>Photophone's</b> variable-area approach—by the end of 1936, only Paramount, MGM, and United Artists still had contracts with ERPI.|$|R
50|$|By 1935 the German Carl Zeiss Company {{had started}} {{producing}} infra-red <b>photophones</b> for the German Army's tank battalions, employing tungsten lamps with infra-red filters which were modulated by vibrating mirrors or prisms. These also used receivers which employed lead sulphide detector cells and amplifiers, boosting their range to 14 km under optimal conditions. The Japanese and Italian armies also attempted similar development of lightwave telecommunications before 1945.|$|R
5|$|During 1929, most of {{the major}} European filmmaking {{countries}} began joining Hollywood in the changeover to sound. Many of the trend-setting European talkies were shot abroad as production companies leased studios while their own were being converted or as they deliberately targeted markets speaking different languages. One of Europe's first two feature-length dramatic talkies was created in still a different sort of twist on multinational moviemaking: The Crimson Circle was a coproduction between director Friedrich Zelnik's Efzet-Film company and British Sound Film Productions (BSFP). In 1928, the film had been released as the silent Der Rote Kreis in Germany, where it was shot; English dialogue was apparently dubbed in much later using the De Forest Phonofilm process controlled by BSFP's corporate parent. It was given a British trade screening in March 1929, as was a part-talking film made entirely in the UK: The Clue of the New Pin, a British Lion production using the sound-on-disc British <b>Photophone</b> system. In May, Black Waters, a British and Dominions Film Corporation promoted as the first UK all-talker, received its initial trade screening; it had been shot completely in Hollywood with a Western Electric sound-on-film system. None of these pictures made much impact.|$|E
5|$|On August 23, the modest-sized Austrian film {{industry}} {{came out with}} a talkie: G'schichten aus der Steiermark (Stories from Styria), an Eagle Film–Ottoton Film production. On September 30, the first entirely German-made feature-length dramatic talkie, Das Land ohne Frauen (Land Without Women), premiered. A Tobis Filmkunst production, about one-quarter of the movie contained dialogue, which was strictly segregated from the special effects and music. The response was underwhelming. Sweden's first talkie, Konstgjorda Svensson (Artificial Svensson), premiered on October 14. Eight days later, Aubert Franco-Film came out with Le Collier de la reine (The Queen's Necklace), shot at the Épinay studio near Paris. Conceived as a silent film, it was given a Tobis-recorded score and a single talking sequence—the first dialogue scene in a French feature. On October 31, Les Trois masques debuted; a Pathé-Natan film, it is generally regarded as the initial French feature talkie, though it was shot, like Blackmail, at the Elstree studio, just outside London. The production company had contracted with RCA <b>Photophone</b> and Britain then had the nearest facility with the system. The Braunberger-Richebé talkie La Route est belle, also shot at Elstree, followed a few weeks later.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Photophone,</b> {{also known}} as a radiophone, was invented jointly by Bell and his then-assistant Sumner Tainter on February 19, 1880, at Bell's 1325 'L' Street {{laboratory}} in Washington, D.C.|$|E
25|$|Bell and his {{assistant}} Charles Sumner Tainter jointly invented a wireless telephone, named a <b>photophone,</b> which allowed for the transmission of both sounds and normal human conversations on a beam of light. Both men later became full associates in the Volta Laboratory Association.|$|E
25|$|RCA {{also made}} {{investments}} in the movie industry, but they performed poorly. In April 1928 RCA <b>Photophone,</b> Inc., was organized {{by a group of}} companies including RCA to develop sound-movie technology. In the fall of 1927, RCA had purchased stock in Film Booking Office (FBO), and on October 25, 1928, with the help of Joseph P. Kennedy, the Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corporation (RKO) studio was formed by merging FBO with Keith-Albee-Orpheum Corporation (KAO), a company whose holdings included motion picture theaters. The theaters in which RKO had an interest provided a potential market for the RCA <b>Photophone</b> sound systems. RCA ownership of RKO stock expanded from approximately 25 percent in 1930 to approximately 61 percent in 1932. However, the RKO studio was poorly run and encountered severe financial problems, going into receivership from early 1933 to 1940. RCA sold its holdings in order to raise funds for its basic operations.|$|E
25|$|In 1927 and 1928, Hollywood {{expanded}} {{its use of}} sound-on-film systems, including Fox Movietone and RCA <b>Photophone.</b> Meanwhile, theater chain owner Isadore Schlesinger purchased the UK rights to Phonofilm and released short films of British music hall performers from September 1926 to May 1929. Almost 200 Phonofilm shorts were made, and many are preserved in the collections of the Library of Congress and the British Film Institute.|$|E
25|$|Bell {{believed}} the <b>photophone</b> was {{his most important}} invention. The device allowed for the transmission of sound on a beam of light. On April 1, 1880, and also described by plaque as occurring on June 3, Bell's assistant transmitted the world's first wireless telephone message to him on their newly invented form of telecommunication, the far advanced precursor to fiber-optic communications. The wireless call was sent from the Franklin School to the window of Bell's laboratory, some 213 meters away.|$|E
25|$|By 1879 Hubbard {{was able}} to {{interest}} Bell in improving upon the phonograph, and {{it was agreed that}} a laboratory should be created in Washington, D.C. Experiments were also to be conducted in telephone and other telecommunication technologies such as the transmission of sound by light, which resulted in the selenium-celled <b>Photophone.</b> Both the Hubbards and the Bells decided to move to the nation's capital, in part due to the numerous legal challenges to Bell's master telephone patent of 1876. Washington was additionally becoming a center of scientific and institutional organizations, which also facilitated Bell's research work.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, Drs. Walter H. Schottky and Erwin Gerlach co-invented the first ribbon microphone. By turning the ribbon circuit in the {{opposite}} direction, they also invented the first ribbon loudspeaker. A few years later, Dr. Harry F. Olson of RCA started developing ribbon microphones using ﬁeld coils and permanent magnets. The RCA <b>Photophone</b> Type PB-31 was commercially manufactured in 1931, greatly impacting the audio recording and broadcasting industries. Condenser microphones at the time could not compare to its frequency response. Radio City Music Hall employed PB-31s in 1932. The following year, the 44A came on the scene. Its tone and pattern control helped reduce reverberation. Many RCA ribbon models are still in use and valued by engineers.|$|E

500|$|On June 17, 1928, FBO's The Perfect Crime, {{directed}} by Bert Glennon and starring Clive Brook and Irene Rich, debuted. It {{was the first}} feature-length [...] "talkie" [...] to appear from a studio other than Warner Bros. since the epochal premiere of Warners' The Jazz Singer eight months before. The Perfect Crime, which went into general release on August 4, had been shot silently. Using the RCA <b>Photophone</b> sound-on-film system, the dialogue was dubbed in afterward—a process then known as [...] "synthetic sound." [...] On August 22, Kennedy {{signed a contract with}} RCA for live <b>Photophone</b> recording; more importantly, he also tendered the company an option to buy his governing share of FBO. Two months later, RCA had acquired controlling stock interests in both the studio and KAO.|$|E
500|$|The studio, whose core {{market was}} America's small towns, also put out many romantic melodramas, non-Western action pictures, and comedic shorts. In 1926, {{financier}} Joseph P. Kennedy led {{a group that}} acquired the company. In June 1928, using RCA <b>Photophone</b> technology, FBO became only the second Hollywood studio to release a feature-length [...] "talkie." [...] A few months later, when Kennedy and RCA chief David Sarnoff arranged the merger that created RKO, FBO {{was included in the}} new company.|$|E
500|$|The first {{successful}} European dramatic talkie was the all-British Blackmail. Directed by twenty-nine-year-old Alfred Hitchcock, the movie had its London debut June 21, 1929. Originally shot as a silent, Blackmail was restaged to include dialogue sequences, {{along with a}} score and sound effects, before its premiere. A British International Pictures (BIP) production, it was recorded on RCA <b>Photophone,</b> General Electric having bought a share of AEG so they could access the Tobis-Klangfilm markets. Blackmail was a substantial hit; critical response was also positive—notorious curmudgeon Hugh Castle, for example, called it [...] "perhaps the most intelligent mixture of sound and silence we have yet seen." ...|$|E
500|$|Wellman {{dedicated}} {{the film}} [...] "to those young warriors {{of the sky}} whose wings are folded about them forever". A sneak preview was shown May 19, 1927, at the Texas Theater on Houston Street in San Antonio. The premiere {{was held at the}} Criterion Theater, in New York City, on August 12, 1927, and was screened for 63 weeks before being moved to second-run theaters. The original Paramount release of Wings was color tinted and had some sequences in an early widescreen process known as Magnascope, also used in the 1926 Paramount film Old Ironsides. The original release also had the aerial scenes use the Handschiegl color process for flames and explosions. Some prints had synchronized sound effects and music, using the General Electric Kinegraphone (later RCA <b>Photophone)</b> sound-on-film process.|$|E
500|$|With Hollywood's {{wholesale}} {{adoption of}} the talkies, the competition between the two fundamental approaches to sound-film production was soon resolved. Over the course of 1930–31, the only major players using sound-on-disc, Warner Bros. and First National, changed over to sound-on-film recording. Vitaphone's dominating presence in sound-equipped theaters, however, meant that {{for years to come}} all of the Hollywood studios pressed and distributed sound-on-disc versions of their films alongside the sound-on-film prints. Fox Movietone soon followed Vitaphone into disuse as a recording and reproduction method, leaving two major American systems: the variable-area RCA <b>Photophone</b> and Western Electric's own variable-density process, a substantial improvement on the cross-licensed Movietone. Under RCA's instigation, the two parent companies made their projection equipment compatible, meaning films shot with one system could be screened in theaters equipped for the other. This left one big issue—the Tobis-Klangfilm challenge. In May 1930, Western Electric won an Austrian lawsuit that voided protection for certain Tri-Ergon patents, helping bring Tobis-Klangfilm to the negotiating table. The following month an accord was reached on patent cross-licensing, full playback compatibility, and the division of the world into three parts for the provision of equipment.
