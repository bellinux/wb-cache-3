40|$|This {{paper has}} been {{designed}} {{as an attempt to}} estimate the magnitude of the influence of relative price shifts on the overall price level in Poland during the transition period 1989 - 1997. For that purpose, the theoretical model has been found that builds on menu costs and trend inflation to derive a positive relationship between variance and skewness of the distribution of relative price changes and the general inflation. The model allowed to estimate the effect of relative price shifts within the framework controlling for nominal and real shocks. Using Polish data, a set of three versions of the model were estimated. All of them yielded high explanatory power and statistically significant coefficients on most variance and skewness variables thus giving a strong empirical support to the theoretical relationship. Larger shifts in relative prices accompanying the adjustment process and detected by higher va riance in the equation were proven to exert substantial upward pressure on inflation that persists over time. On the other hand, high positive skewness reflecting the domination of the adjustment process by few large increases was confirmed to produce contemporaneous upward impulse that tends to wear off after one quarter but is stronger in magnitude than that coming from higher variance. Including other explanatory variables like real exchange rate, wages and/or money allowed for observing the relative importance of inflationary factors. The analysis revealed that money and wages remain to be the main factors fueling inflation and can jointly account for almost three quarters <b>of</b> quarterly <b>inflation.</b> If their impact is evaluated separately, wages contribute about one half <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> and domestic credit almost one third. On the other hand, real exchange rate appreciation was confirmed to significantly lower inflation.

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{summarise}} the recent economic literature {{on the relationship between}} inflation and growth, to assess what inflation target might be most consistent with the fastest <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> sustainable economic growth. One conclusion is that the relationship between inflation and growth seems to be different at different rates <b>of</b> <b>inflation.</b> At very low rates <b>of</b> <b>inflation,</b> including the 0 - 3 per cent range, the growth rate seems to be independent <b>of</b> the <b>inflation</b> rate. But at higher rates <b>of</b> <b>inflation,</b> there is evidence that inflation does significant damage to growth. There is some theoretical literature which cautions central banks against deflation, and therefore against including zero in an inflation target range.

In Brischetto and Richards (2006), we argue that good measures of underlying inflation are likely to have some short-term predictive power for inflation.

This is not surprising as real estate is the largest financial asset most Canadians have in their possession. The housing market is prone to cyclical ups and downs and we should embark on a gradual, modest, downward adjustment over the next three years.

However, this pace will be moderately lower than they have been historically (5. 4 %).

At the time of the February Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, considerable evidence suggested that the U. S. economy had moved into a period of more-vigorous expansion. Nonetheless, some businesses remained cautious about hiring and investment. In the event, businesses stepped up their hiring in the spring, and capital spending seems to have continued apace. > Over the first half of this year, energy prices soared, and inflation in core consumer prices increased. To some extent, the upturn in core inflation reflected the indirect effects of higher energy prices. In addition, strengthening aggregate demand worldwide induced a surge in the prices of many primary commodities and industrial materials, and the decline in the dollar in 2003 put upward pressure on import prices. In this environment, firms were better able to pass on the higher costs of imports, raise the prices of domestically produced items that compete with imports, and in many cases boost their profit margins. > Monetary policy was very accommodative at the start of 2004 as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sought to provide continuing support to the {{economic expansion}}.

In this paper {{we attempt to}} test the hypothesis that downward real wage changes occur more readily in higher-inflation environments.

These counterfactual distributions suggest that a 1 percent increase in the inflation rate reduces the fraction of workers with downward-rigid wages by about 0. 8 percent, and allows real wages to fall about 0. 06 percent faster. A market- level analysis of the effects of nominal rigidities, based on wage growth and unemployment at the state level, is less conclusive.

To carry out the evaluation, I adopted the Before-After and Control Group approaches that have been conventionally used in evaluating {{the effects of}} IMF-sponsored economic programmes on the economic performances. The findings suggest that military regimes generally tend to reduce the capital formation ratio, domestic saving ratio, inflow of direct foreign investments, and the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> economic growth, while increasing the share of government expenditure in the GDP, monetary growth, and rate <b>of</b> <b>inflation,</b> and in addition, generally tend to worsen both tha current account balance and overall balance of payment positions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the theory of}} the Phillips curve, focusing on the distinction between "formation" <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> expectations and "incorporation" <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> expectations. Phillips curve theory has largely focused on the former. Explaining the Phillips curve by reference to expectation formation keeps Phillips curve theory in the policy orbit of natural rate thinking where there is no welfare justification for higher inflation even if there is a permanent inflation - unemployment trade-off. Explaining the Phillips curve by reference to incorporation <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> expectations breaks that orbit and provides a welfare economics rationale for Keynesian activist policies that reduce unemployment at the cost <b>of</b> higher <b>inflation.</b> Phillips curve, formation <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> expectations, incorporation <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> expectations, backward bending Phillips curve. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMethods on {{effective}} management <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> expectation are the central issues of current economic work. With reviewing and theoretically {{sorting out the}} correlation theory <b>of</b> <b>inflation,</b> taking the tendency <b>of</b> Chinese <b>inflation</b> between 2009 and 2010 as example, this paper presents positive analysis on the interrelationship between inflation and inflation expectation, and some proposals for the management <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> expectation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{adoption}} <b>of</b> an <b>inflation</b> target reduces the persistence <b>of</b> <b>inflation.</b> We develop the theoretical literature on inflation persistence by introducing a Taylor rule for monetary policy into a model of persistence and showing that inflation targets reduce inflation persistence. We investigate changes in the time series properties <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> in seven countries that introduced inflation targets in the late 1980 s or early 1990 s. We find that the persistence <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> is greatly reduced or eliminated following the introduction <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> targets...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews {{theory and}} {{evidence}} of the welfare effects <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> from a costbenefit perspective. Basic models and selected empirical results are discussed. Historically, in assessing the welfare effects <b>of</b> <b>inflation,</b> the distortion <b>of</b> money demand played a prominent role. More recently, interactions <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> and taxation came into focus. Growth effects <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> as well as welfare effects <b>of</b> unanticipated <b>inflation</b> and <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> uncertainty are also addressed. To assess the policy question whether inflation should be reduced or eliminated, the costs of disinflation play a role. Finally, the trade-off between the benefits <b>of</b> reducing <b>inflation</b> {{and the costs of}} disinflation is discussed and an overall assessment of the net welfare effects of achieving price stability is provided.
