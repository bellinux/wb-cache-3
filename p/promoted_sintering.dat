40|$|Silicon carbide based {{ceramics}} have properties such {{as their}} high strength and thermal stability that make them desirable as high temperature structural materials. However, traditional methodologies for production of ceramic materials are limiting as they do not allow the formation of complex shapes. The goal of the work described in this dissertation was to develop new single-source polymeric precursors to modified silicon carbide ceramics including SiOCB, SiCB, SiOCZr, and SiOCNZr materials {{for the production of}} fibers and matrix materials. ^ Three types of boron-containing polymer precursors to SiCB and SiOCB ceramics were developed. Pinacolborane and diethylborazine-modified polyvinylsiloxanes were synthesized in excellent yields by the RhH(CO) (PPh 3) 3 catalyzed reactions of polyvinylsiloxane with either pinacolborane or diethylborazine. The 9 -borabicyclo[3. 3. 1]nonane-modified allylhydridopolycarbosilane polymers were also synthesized in high yield by the reaction of allylhydridopolycarbosilane with 9 -BBN. The degree of polymer substitution in all cases was controlled by varying the reactant ratios. Bulk pyrolysis of the modified polymers produced SiCB ceramics, with boron contents ranging from 0. 2 to 0. 7 % depending upon the percentage of polymer modification. Density and XRD studies of the 1800 °C and 2000 °C chars showed that the addition of boron, in fact, affected the degree of crystallization and <b>promoted</b> <b>sintering</b> of the ceramic. Additionally, the pinacolborane-modified polyvinylsiloxane polymers were found to be excellent melt-processable, single-source precursors to small diameter SiOCB fibers, while the 9 -BBN-modified allyhydridopolycarbosilane polymers can be used for matrix materials. ^ Three new types of poly(zirconosiloxane), poly(zirconocarbosilane), and poly(zirconosilazane) polymeric precursors were also achieved by the high yield hydrozirconation reactions between polyvinylsiloxane, allylhydridopolycarbosilane, and poly(ureamethylvinyl) silazane and zirconocene chloride hydride. Again the degree of polymer modification was controlled by varying the reactant ratios. All the zirconium-modified polymers had thermal decomposition temperatures similar to their respective parent materials, but that the ceramic yields of the poly(zirconocarbosilane), and poly(zirconosilazane) derived materials were improved over their parents. Bulk pyrolyses of the modified polymers produced SiOCZr, and SiOCNZr ceramic chars with zirconium contents ranging from 0. 9 to 2. 9 %. XRD studies of the ceramics showed that heat resistance and crystal growth were affected by the addition of the zirconium. ...|$|E
40|$|Fluidised bed {{combustion}} (FBC) {{has been}} identified {{as one of the best}} technologies available for lump coal combustion. A major drawback during prolonged operation of FBC systems particularly bubbling fluidised bed (BFB) systems is sintering and agglomerate formation of bed material that affects performance efficiency and reliability in industrial applications as exemplified at Associated British Sugar (AB Sugar). The mechanisms responsible for sintering and agglomerate formation in this type of system need to be understood, to promote continual use of this technology for efficient coal utilisation. The first set of investigations focused on agglomeration properties of bed material (Garside 14 / 25 sand) used in Industrial FBC at AB Sugar. Bed material was calcinated between 800 and 1200 °C in a high temperature furnace in the absence and presence of coal (three types of bituminous coals) or coal ash. Results showed sintering and agglomerate formation of bed material can occur in the absence of coal or coal ash at a calcination temperature near 1200 °C. Addition of coal or coal ash further promotes sintering and agglomerate formation at 1000 °C. Combustion stages appears to influence surface morphology, chemistry and mechanisms of agglomerated bed material based on similarities observed in the agglomerated bed material formed from calcination of Garside 14 / 25 sand bed material mixed with coal, and those formed in industrial scale FBC during combustion of lump coal. The second set of investigations used two different lump bituminous coals classified as washed (undergone washing process to remove mud/shale stone) or unwashed (still containing the mud/shale) from the same mine (Blyth, typically referred to as Blyth coals) as those used in the AB Sugar industrial FBC. Combustion of washed and unwashed Blyth lump coals (9 to 19 mm particle size) was investigated in a 30 kW pilot scale bubbling fluidised bed combustor (PSBFBC) during normal combustion and crash stop combustion runs. This simulated conditions in the AB Sugar Industrial FBC system with a thermal rating of approximately 30 MW, which uses larger coal particle size of 12 to 25 mm. Results reveal unwashed Blyth lump coal in the PSBFBC and industrial FBC causes some sintering and agglomerate formation of the bed material over short operation periods of 52 and 240 hours respectively, which was not observed in the washed Blyth coal system over a similar operating period. Observed sintering and agglomeration formation in unwashed Blyth coal is mainly attributed to accumulation of mud/shale stones in the bed, which would have been mostly removed by the washing process. The crash stop combustion run, done to simulate the fan trip scenario in the industrial FBC system, <b>promoted</b> <b>sintering</b> and agglomerate formation in the PSBFBC, possibly due to the 30 to 50 °C temperature rise in the bed when fluidised air was stopped. Continuous deposition and increasing concentration of mud/shale stones in the bed affects the localised temperature as well as the fluidising properties and quality, eventually promoting sintering and agglomerate formation. PSBFBC bed height, bed material particle size and measured pressure drop also increase with increasing operating time and mud/shale stones deposition in the bed. Deposition of coal ash to the surface of the bed material (sand) in the PSBFBC was analysed by the use of SEM-EDX and XRF. The deposition of ash to the surface of PSBFBC bed material sand increases as the operation times increases, as identified by increasing concentration of Al, K and Ca on fluidised bed sand particle surfaces in their stable oxide forms of Al 2 O 3, K 2 O and CaO respectively...|$|E

Powder compacts are heated externally and pressure is applied hydraulitically. In order to improve densification during hot pressing, diboride powders can undergo milling by attrition to obtain powders of <2μm. Milling also allows for more uniform dispersion of the additive SiC. Hot pressing temperature, pressure, heating rate, reaction atmosphere, and holding times are all factors that affect the density and microstructure of UHTC pellets obtained from this method. In order to achieve >99% densification from hot pressing, temperatures of 1800-2000 °C and pressures of 30 MPa or greater are required. UHTC materials with 20vol.% SiC and toughened with 5% carbon black as additives exhibit increased densification above 1500 °C, but these materials still require temperatures of 1900 °C and a pressure of 30 MPa {{in order to obtain}} near theoretical densities.

These Ce 0. 73 −xZr 0. 27 NdxO 2 mixed oxides with 0. 01 ≤ x ≤ 0. 09 are also able to accelerate CO oxidation in a certain extent, {{but there is a}} net production of CO during soot combustion because the oxidation capacity of these oxides is not high enough to oxidize all CO released as soot combustion product.

40|$|The {{object of}} the present work was to {{investigate}} new alloy emitters using an activation sintering method for their preparation. It was also desired to study the effect of porosity on thermionic emission. Alloys of W-Pd, W-Ni, W-Co and W-Cu were chosen because Palladium and Nickel strongly <b>promote</b> <b>sintering</b> whereas Cobalt and Copper have a much lower activating powers, although they are otherwise closely related transition elements. The emitters were impregnated with optimum concentration of metal salts, reduced and sintered in hydrogen tube furnace. The technique results in an effectively monatomic emitting layer around each tungsten particle. The results show the reduction in work function of the emitters e. g. W-Pd (0. 25 ev); W-Ni (0. 20 ev); W-Co (0. 40 ev) and W-Cu (0. 30 ev). Presintered (porous) emitters have ten times more emission than fully sintered emitters, and their thermionic curves are heterogenous consisting of three steps in the saturation region. Porous emitters are characterized by a surface which consists of protuberances and cavities, and the heterogenous nature of emission {{is assumed to be}} associated with different depths of the cavities. Decay in saturation emission (with a rate coefficient of between 0. 4 - 0. 55) has been observed in emitters which are sintering during emission; this phenomenon is not obtained in fully sintered materials and porous tungsten. A new correlation has been proposed to connect the work function of both elemental and duplex emitters with the number of electrons in the outershell of the component atoms. This correlation explains qualitatively the values of work function of most emitting surfaces. An attempt has also been made to quantitize the correlation by reference to the spectroscopically determined promotion energies of the s-p-d electronic states used in the hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|High-strength, {{lightweight}} castable refractories {{based on}} spinel were prepared by introducing porous corundum-spinel aggregate and appropriate microsilica. The effects of microsilica content on microstructure and properties of lightweight castable refractories were investigated using SEM, XRD, mercury porosimetry measurements and FactSage thermochemical software. It's found that microsilica was almost dissolved into a liquid phase at high temperature, which <b>promoted</b> liquid <b>sintering.</b> With increasing microsilica content, the matrices became denser and {{average pore size}} of matrices increased, then apparent porosity decreased, crushing strength increased and content of liquid phase in castables at 1600 °C increased. The appropriate microsilica content is 0. 65 to 1. 95 wt%, which reaches to a compromise among apparent porosity (33 - 38 %), crushing strength (82 - 125 MPa) and liquid content (1. 80 ~ 4. 97 wt%) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Sintered powder {{metallurgy}} Fe based composites with advanced mechanical properties {{have been proposed}} as substitutes for more expensive cemented carbide and wrought alloys in many applications, especially as inexpensive wear resistance parts. The aim of this work was to fabricate and characterize a composite made of Fe-Cr as the matrix and Al 2 O 3 particles as reinforcement. The composite was made by {{powder metallurgy}} method. The effect of different amount of binder, mixing duration, compaction pressure and sintering temperature has been investigated. Densification, micro hardness, wear resistance and compressive strength were used to characterize the composite. Powder metallurgy parameters that satisfy the composites quality have been optimized and result showed that higher <b>sintering</b> temperatures <b>promote</b> good <b>sintering</b> in the composites which produced better densification, higher reading of micro hardness, better wear resistance and compressive strength...|$|R
3000|$|The field {{assisted}} sintering technique (FAST) or spark plasma sintering (SPS) originates from pulsed electrical currents flowing {{directly through}} a graphite die or powder materials, the process features high energy requirements (typically {{a few thousand}} amperes and several volts), high heating rates (up to 1000  K/min), and high temperature gradient processing (Groza and Zavaliangos 2000; Hungria et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2014). Although several fundamental investigations on the process have been conducted, knowledge of transient mechanism involving pulse currents and high heat rates under pressure remains lacking because of the complex effects of thermal, electrical, and mechanical processes on mass transport (Antou et al. 2015). For example, in original SPS theory, electrical discharges are believed {{to exist in the}} gaps between powder particles, these charges can generate plasma to enhance the thermal diffusion ability of material (Kasperski et al. 2013) and <b>promote</b> <b>sintering</b> (Perera et al. 1998). However, no clear evidence has been presented to demonstrate the occurrence of discharges and the presence of spark plasma during the SPS process (Hulbert et al. 2009). Hulbert used a number of different methods, including in situ atomic emission spectroscopy, direct visual observations, and ultrafast in situ voltage measurements under a variety of SPS conditions to investigate the presence of spark plasma and occurrence of discharge during sintering, thereafter concluding that plasma, sparking, or arcing does not occur during either the initial or final stage of SPS (Hulbert et al. 2009). Tomino measured the current passing through Al 2 O 3 samples and found a value close to zero (Tomino et al. 1997). On the other hand, Wang et al. (2000) found that compact Al 2 O 3 powder is denser at the edges than {{in the middle of the}} sample at short holding times. Wang et al. (2000) concluded that rapid sintering may be attributed to efficient heat transfer because the graphite mold and punches function as heating elements. Rapid sintering may also be attributed to application of a high heat rate during SPS.|$|R
