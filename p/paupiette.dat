40|$|In {{the present}} paper I focus on the {{documentation}} in the third edition of the Oxford English Dictionary (henceforth, OED 3). While the material of the first (OED 1) and second (OED 2) editions has often been hotly debated (e. g. Schäfer 1980, 1989; Willinsky 1994; McConchie 1997; Brewer 2006, 2007), studies on the newly-revised edition have so far been undertaken by the lexicographers only (e. g. Durkin 2002; Simpson 2004, Simpson, Weiner and Durkin 2004; Gilliver 2005). Nonetheless, even though the revision is a huge academic enterprise - and its results are truly amazing - OED 3 documentation should no doubt be verified systematically to point out inevitable gaps and inconsistencies. It seems that Google Books, a gigantic online resource, will make such verification feasible; as my research has already shown, despite its numerous deficiencies, Google Books can be successfully "harnessed" for lexicological and lexicographic purposes (Podhajecka in press). To arrive at reliable results, I worked with headwords from OED 3 letter sections revised to date(M-R), which were extracted automatically {{by means of the}} "search in definitions" option, "cookery" being used as the query keyword. Next, I excluded all the words and senses with the first attestation before 1750, because an overwhelming majority of Google Books texts come from {{the second half of the}} 18 th century and later periods, and I took into account nominal senses only. The final research sample covered 92 headwords, most of which are loanwords reflecting foreign cuisines (e. g. masala, minceur, mirin, pain de campagne, ras malai). There are two major points to be raised. Firstly, some additional evidence deserves to be introduced into the dictionary, as there are a number of antedating quotations in Google Books―some of which push the first recorded occurrence by over a hundred years―that have been omitted by OED 3 lexicographers. Regrettably, only a proportion of the quotations are verifiable (they come from full-text sources), while others may not be fully credible (they are available in the form of text snippets). No data has been found mainly for 20 th-century senses of frequent lexical items (e. g. mark, pancake, purse), perhaps because I failed to come up with relevant Boolean expressions to limit the number of hits. Secondly, to help improve existing documentation, I offer suggestions concerning various aspects of the dictionary material, such as sense discrimination (e. g. masala, Napolitana, parcel, pastilla), classification of quotations(e. g. microwave, polonaise, portugaise), the treatment of full and shortened forms (e. g. mousseline/mousseline sauce, peel/candied peel), and the use of endophoric reference (e. g. pin/rolling pin). Occasionally, neither the use of lower-case and upper-case letter (e. g. nasi Padang) nor labelling (e. g. mochi, patty, rasgulla) is fully consistent. The effectiveness of the selection procedure is also an issue, inasmuch as a handful of headwords labelled Cookery have not been retrieved automatically (e. g. paste, pistou, pirog, poupiets, <b>paupiette),</b> which could be noticed thanks to the dictionary's rich cross-referencing structure.

50|$|Veal {{has been}} an {{important}} ingredient in Italian, French cuisine and other mediterranian cuisine from ancient times. The veal is often in the form of cutlets, such as the Italian cotoletta or the famous Austrian dish Wiener Schnitzel. Some classic French veal dishes include fried escalopes, fried veal Grenadines (small, thick fillet steaks), stuffed <b>paupiettes,</b> roast joints, and blanquettes. Because veal is lower in fat than many meats, care must be taken in preparation to ensure that it does not become tough. Veal is often coated in preparation for frying or eaten with a sauce. Veal Parmigiana is a common Italian-American dish made with breaded veal cutlets.|$|R
5000|$|In her introduction, David wrote: By summer cookery I do not {{necessarily}} mean cold food; although cold dishes are always agreeable in summer at most meals, however hot the weather, one hot dish is welcome, {{but it should be}} a light one, such as a very simply cooked sole, an omelette, a soup of the young vegetables which are in season - something fresh which provides {{at the same time a}} change, a new outlook. [...] Summer Cooking reflected David's strong belief in eating food in season; she loved [...] "the pleasure of rediscovering each season's vegetables" [...] and thought it [...] "rather dull to eat the same food all year round." [...] Unconstrained by the geographical agendas of her first three books, David wrote about dishes from Britain, India, Mauritius, Russia, Spain and Turkey, as well as France, Italy and Greece. Reviewing the first edition, The Observer said: Men who pretend to know about it can be more pretentiously precious over cooking than almost anything else. Thank heavens that the women are at last beginning to put them right. The latest blow at food in fancy dress and out of season (a male weakness from Apicius to Escoffier) is Elizabeth David's forthright Summer Cooking. … For her food has more to do with the seasons, the sea and the countryside than with tin and deep freeze, and cooking concerns saucepan, fire and flavour rather than pretty picture colour patterns. The book is a tonic whether you dabble nervously in the kitchen or have [...] "views" [...] on cooking. [...] In addition to those subjects like soups, fish and meat common to all her books to date, David included chapters about hors d'oeuvre and salads, preserves, buffet food, and [...] "Improvised cooking for holidays".
