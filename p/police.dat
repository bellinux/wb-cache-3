40|$|<b>Policing</b> is {{regarded}} as an important mechanism for maintaining cooperation in human and animal social groups. A simple model providing a theoretical overview of the coevolution of <b>policing</b> and cooperation has been analyzed by Frank (1995, 1996 b, 2003, 2009), and this suggests that <b>policing</b> will evolve to fully suppress cheating within social groups when relatedness is low. Here, we relax some of the assumptions made by Frank, and investigate the consequences for <b>policing</b> and cooperation. First, we address the implicit assumption that the individual cost of investment into <b>policing</b> is reduced when selfishness dominates. We find that relaxing this assumption leads to <b>policing</b> being favored only at intermediate relatedness. Second, we address the assumption that <b>policing</b> fully recovers the loss of fitness incurred by the group owing to selfishness. We find that relaxing this assumption prohibits the evolution of full <b>policing.</b> Finally, we consider the impact of demography on the coevolution of <b>policing</b> and cooperation, in particular the role for kin competition to disfavor the evolution of <b>policing,</b> using both a heuristic "open" model and a "closed" island model. We find that large groups and increased kin competition disfavor <b>policing,</b> and that <b>policing</b> is maintained more readily than it invades. <b>Policing</b> may be harder to evolve than previously thought...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{evaluates the}} impact of Neighbourhood <b>Policing</b> in a local community, focusing in particular on the perceptions of key stakeholders {{and members of the}} community. Neighbourhood <b>policing</b> is the most recent model of community <b>policing</b> in the UK, whilst community <b>policing</b> has been a popular model in the USA it has not been as influential in the UK. However, during the early 2000 s there was growing anxiety and an increase in the public’s fear of crime, despite crime rates decreasing since the mid 1990 s. This {{led to the development of}} the National Reassurance <b>Policing</b> Programme. This programme developed a set of practical <b>policing</b> strategies that were targeted, primarily, at reducing fear of crime amongst the public. The Neighbourhood <b>Policing</b> model developed directly out of the reassurance programme, and is attempting, with the extension of the <b>policing</b> family, to provide each community with a local <b>policing</b> team that is both visible and accessible.
