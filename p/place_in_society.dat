Through her work in the temperance movement and her association with friends such as Maria Daviess and Ida Clyde Clark, Dudley became convinced that women's <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>society</b> could only be improved if women were allowed to vote. At the time, however, a majority of men and women opposed the idea of women participating in the political process.|$|E

25|$|Known as Madame Cavé {{during the}} July Monarchy {{due to her}} husband's {{official}} duties, she was equally friendly with Neoclassicist admirers of Ingres and with Romantic painters such as Delacroix, with whom she was friends. After she was widowed, she taught drawing to young women and published two teaching pamphlets on drawing and colour during the Second French Empire. She later also published reflections on women's conduct and <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E
25|$|Madame Cavé then wrote L'aquarelle sans maître (Watercolour {{without a}} master), {{in which she}} {{discussed}} colour. These two small books combined a learning method, practical advice, reflections on the theoretical order {{of arts and crafts}} and moral treatments of women's <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>society.</b> The works she published later did not contain moral discussions - after she was widowed she became a more and more fervent Roman Catholic, in a way similar to other figures born during the First Empire.|$|E

According to Walpola Rahula, Christian missionaries displaced and appropriated the educational, social, and welfare activities of the monks, and inculcated a permanent shift in views regarding the proper position of monks in society through their institutional influence upon the elite. Many monks in post-colonial times have dedicated themselves to undoing these changes. Movements intending to restore Buddhism's <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>society</b> have developed in both Sri Lanka and Myanmar.|$|E

25|$|The Roman Catholic Church's {{relationship}} with the Sandinistas was extremely complex. Initially, the Church was committed to supporting the Somoza regime. The Somoza dynasty was willing to secure the Church a prominent <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>society</b> {{as long as it}} did not attempt to subvert the authority of the regime. Under the constitution of 1950 the Roman Catholic Church was recognized as the official religion and church-run schools flourished. It was not until the late 1970s that the Church began to speak out against the corruption and human rights abuses that characterized the Somoza regime.|$|E

Even {{before the end of the}} war, Langston worked for issues of black suffrage and opportunity.

The rationale that Heinsohn gives is that these population trends leave many people unable to find prestigious <b>places</b> <b>in</b> <b>society,</b> so they {{turn their attention to}} creating change <b>in</b> <b>society.</b>|$|R

25|$|Dewey {{believed}} that a woman’s <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>society</b> was determined by her environment and not just her biology. On women he says, “You think too much of women in terms of sex. Think of them as human individuals for a while, dropping out the sex qualification, and you won’t be so sure of some of your generalizations about what they should and shouldn’t do”. John Dewey’s support helped to increase the support and popularity of Jane Addams’ Hull House and other settlement houses as well. With growing support, involvement of the community grew {{as well as the}} support for the women’s suffrage movement.|$|E

25|$|Clothes {{were seen}} as an {{expression}} of women’s <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>society</b> and were hence, differentiated in terms of social class. Upper class women, who did not need to work, often wore a tightly laced corset over a bodice or chemisette, and paired them with a skirt adorned with numerous embroideries and trims; over layers of petticoats. Middle class women exhibited similar dress styles; however, the decorations were not as extravagant. The layering of these garments make them very heavy. Corsets were also stiff and restricted movement. Although the clothes were not comfortable, the type of fabrics and the in-numerous layers were worn as a symbol of wealth.|$|E

25|$|Her protagonists often {{attempt to}} uphold {{existing}} social institutions and norms {{in the service}} of the greater good while the antagonists often attempt to exploit, subvert or radically alter the predominant social order for selfish gain. She uses the theme of the outsider finding his (or her) <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>society</b> and how individuals interact with The Other. A number of Cherryh's novels focus on military and political themes. One underlying theme of her work is an exploration of gender roles. Her characters reveal both strengths and weaknesses regardless of their gender, although her female protagonists are portrayed as especially capable and determined, and many of her male characters are portrayed as damaged, abused, or otherwise vulnerable.|$|E
25|$|In Rawls' philosophy, the {{original}} position is the correlate to the Hobbesian state of nature. While in {{the original}} position, persons {{are said to be}} behind the veil of ignorance, which makes these persons unaware of their individual characteristics and their <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>society,</b> such as their race, religion, wealth, etc. The principles of justice are chosen by rational persons while in this original position. The two principles of justice are the equal liberty principle and the principle which governs the distribution of social and economic inequalities. From this, Rawls argues for a system of distributive justice in accordance with the Difference Principle, which says that all social and economic inequalities must be to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged.|$|E
25|$|The {{different}} effects honor instills upon men {{and women}} {{can be seen in}} the ancient world, where women and men played contrasting roles in society. Men displayed their honorable roles in public while women were restricted to the limitations of their households. While in public, women were required to avoid conversations with estranged men while only visiting places frequented by women. In the present Islamic culture, men hold a higher social status, but they also carry more responsibility in caring and providing for their family. If a man is single or childless his <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>society</b> does not waver or become lower. A woman should have a family whom she stays faithful to and respectful towards at all times. A man's actions will not greatly affect or hurt his family's standing like a woman's actions would. Women are perceived as vulnerable individuals who must be kept safe at all times. This aspect of a woman's characterization comes from her fertility and role within her family.|$|E
