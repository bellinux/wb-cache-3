40|$|A {{retrospective}} study of 3456 deliveries was conducted from {{the records of}} four Standardbred broodmare farms where mares were bred by artificial insemination and maintained under close veterinary supervision. Retained fetal membranes (RFM) were observed in 10. 6 % of the deliveries. Retained fetal membranes occurred more frequently (p < 0. 05) after dystocia and in mares which had RFM the <b>previous</b> <b>year.</b> <b>Retained</b> fetal membranes after normal foaling had no {{significant effect on the}} reproductive performance (pregnancy rate, pregnancy loss rate, or foaling rate), nor on the general health of the mares, regardless of the duration of RFM (3 to 144 hours). Postfoaling laminitis was not observed. Oxytocin therapy of mares with RFM starting at two hours postpartum significantly reduced the incidence of RFM ≥ 8 hours. Mares with RFM which had received intrauterine antimicrobials between foaling and first breeding had a foaling rate similar to mares with RFM which had not received intrauterine therapy...|$|R

50|$|For 1991, Emanuele Pirro, {{who drove}} {{for the team}} the <b>previous</b> <b>year,</b> was <b>retained</b> while Andrea de Cesaris was {{replaced}} by JJ Lehto, who crashed the car heavily in pre-season testing. Due {{to the number of}} teams attempting to qualify for races this, together with Scuderia Italia's failure to score any points the <b>previous</b> <b>year,</b> meant that {{for the first half of}} the season, both drivers were forced to pre-qualify. When Lehto secured the team's best finish of the year by finishing third at the San Marino Grand Prix, the four points earned from the race meant that from the German Grand Prix onwards, he and Pirro had direct entry to qualifying. While pre-qualifying was no barrier for Lehto, Pirro had failed three times. When he qualified for races, Pirro enjoyed relatively good reliability in contrast to Lehto who only finished five races all year. Pirro's best race was at the Monaco, where he scored a single point for sixth place.|$|R

For measuring the firm’s life cycle, two criteria namely <b>retained</b> <b>earnings</b> to equity ratio and <b>retained</b> <b>earnings</b> to assets ratio have been used as proxies of firm’s life cycle. The findings of this research show that only <b>retained</b> <b>earnings</b> to assets ratio has a meaningful and positive effect on dividend payout policy; In the companies that are growing, <b>retained</b> <b>earnings</b> to assets ratio is low; Whereas this ratio is high in the more mature companies and these firms have abundant <b>retained</b> <b>earnings,</b> hence they are good candidates to pay dividends. However, there was no meaningful relationship between another life cycle criteria namely <b>retained</b> <b>earnings</b> to equity ratio and dividend payout policy...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{hypothesis}} that dividend taxes are capitalized into share prices by focusing on investors' implicit valuations of <b>retained</b> <b>earnings</b> versus paid-in equity. <b>Retained</b> <b>earnings</b> are distributable as taxable dividends, whereas paid-in equity is distributable as a tax-free return of capital. Consistent with dividend tax capitalization, firm-level results for the United States indicate that accumulated <b>retained</b> <b>earnings</b> are valued less per unit than contributed capital. In addition, differences in dividend tax rates across U.
