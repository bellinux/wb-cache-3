40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{a new class of}} OR games: economic lot-sizing (ELS) games. There are a number of retailers that have a known demand for a fixed number of periods. To satisfy demand the retailers order products at the same manufacturer. By <b>placing</b> <b>joint</b> orders instead of individual orders, costs can be reduced and a cooperative game arises. In this paper we show that ELS games are balanced. Furthermore, we show that two special classes of ELS games are concave. inventory;production;lot-sizing;gamet heory...|$|E
40|$|Abstract] In {{this paper}} we analyze a {{situation}} in which several firms deal with inventory problems concerning the same type of product. We consider that each firm uses its limited capacity warehouse for storing purposes and that it faces an economic order quantity model where storage costs are irrelevant (and assumed to be zero) and shortages are allowed. In this setting, we show that firms can save costs by <b>placing</b> <b>joint</b> orders and obtain an optimal order policy for the firms. Besides, we identify an associated class of costs games which we show to be concave. Finally, we introduce and study a rule to share the costs among the firms which provides core allocations and can be easily computed.

40|$|We {{consider}} the economic lot-sizing (ELS) game with general concave ordering cost. In this cooperative game, multiple retailers form a coalition by <b>placing</b> <b>joint</b> orders {{to a single}} supplier {{in order to reduce}} ordering cost. When both the inventory holding cost and backlogging cost are linear functions, it can be shown that the core of this game is non-empty. The main contribution {{of this paper is to}} show that a core allocation can be computed in polynomial time. Our approach is based on linear programming (LP) duality and is motivated by the work of Owen [19]. We suggest an integer programming formulation for the ELS problem and show that its LP relaxation admits zero integrality gap, which makes it possible to analyze the ELS game by using LP duality. We show that, there exists an optimal dual solution that defines an allocation in the core. An interesting feature of our approach is that it is not necessarily true that every optimal dual solution defines a core allocation. This is in contrast to the duality approach for other known cooperative games in the literature. ...|$|E
