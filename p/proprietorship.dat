Following {{the overthrow of the}} Calvert <b>proprietorship</b> and the subsequent exclusion of Catholics from colonial government, Carroll turned his attention to planting, law, business, and various offices in the proprietor's remnant organization. He was the wealthiest man in the colony by the time of his death. In the last years of his life, Carroll attempted to regain some vestige of political power for Catholics in the colony, but the Protestant colonial assembly and Governor John Hart disfranchised them. His son, Charles Carroll of Annapolis, became a wealthy planter and his grandson, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, also wealthy, was the only Catholic signer of the United States Declaration of Independence.|$|E

Avalon, which remained a prime spot for the salting and export of fish, was expropriated by Sir David Kirke, with a new royal charter which Cecil Calvert vigorously challenged, and it was finally absorbed into Newfoundland in 1754. Although Baltimore's failed Avalon venture marked the end of an early era of attempts at proprietary colonisation, it laid the foundation upon which permanent settlements developed in that region of Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|In ancient times, land {{appears to}} have been held in common with an {{individual}} unable to sell it without the consent of the other owners, who in most cases were members of the same community. Prior to the arrival of the British, the concept of individual <b>proprietorship</b> of land had already emerged along India's west coast such that the new administration's land revenue system was not markedly different from that of its predecessor. Nevertheless, landlords never sold land without the consent of other members of the community. This communistic property rights system was known as kaniachi among the Vellalars, swastium among the Brahmins and mirasi among Muslims and Christians. In the Tanjore district, all mirasi in the village were vested in a single individual who was called the Ekabhogam. The mirasidars were required to donate {{a certain amount of money}} known as mirei to the village administration. They also paid a specified sum to the Government. In return, the mirasidars demanded non-interference by the government in the internal affairs of the villages.|$|E
40|$|Survey of Business Owners {{data was}} used to compare the husband or wife as the primary {{operator}} of jointly owned employer and nonemployer copreneur firms. The analysis found 1. 7 million firms, which account for ten percent of all firms, or fourteen percent of sole <b>proprietorships.</b> Nearly three-fourths of copreneur businesses are operated by men. The majority (88. 9 percent) of copreneur firms do not have employees. Employer firms are decreasing while nonemployer sole <b>proprietorships</b> run by women are the fastest growing segment of copreneurships. An important finding was that differences that might be attributed to gender are more likely due {{to whether or not the}} firm has employees. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This paper deepens our understanding of copreneurs by using the large Survey of Business Owners (SBO) database to analyze the business outcomes when the husband and wife are compared as the primary operator of jointly owned employer and nonemployer sole <b>proprietorships.</b> Based on 72. 6 percent of the 23 million nonfarm firms that responded to the survey, two questions unambiguously identify copreneurs. The federal economic census overcomes the research limitations of small sample size and/or non-representative samples. The study found 1. 7 million jointly owned sole <b>proprietorships,</b> which account for 10. 1 percent of all firms (corporations, partnerships and sole <b>proprietorships)</b> or 14. 1 percent of respondent sole <b>proprietorships.</b> Nearly three-fourths (72. 7 percent) of copreneurships are operated by men.

5|$|Norsk Air was a Norwegian airline {{based at}} Sandefjord Airport, Torp. At its height from the mid-1980s and onwards it {{operated}} scheduled flights to Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim and Copenhagen, and for shorter periods also other Norwegian and international destinations. The airline had 156 employees and 150,000 annual passengers in 1989. The company was {{established as a}} sole <b>proprietorship</b> by Øyvind Skaunfelt as Vestfoldfly in 1961, after purchasing Thor Solberg's aviation school at Tønsberg Airport, Jarlsberg. In addition to an aviation college, the company operated various charter services using mostly Cessna aircraft. The company split into a flying school and an airline in 1972, with the latter taking the name Norsk Flytjeneste. Three 50-passenger Douglas DC-6 were subsequently bought and were among other places flown with aid charters to Bangladesh. Both the DC-6 and later charter flights with business jets proved unprofitable and were quickly terminated.|$|E
5|$|Toledo's team, under {{financial}} {{pressure at}} season's end, worked to relieve themselves of their expensive contracts. Not yet fully {{recovered from a}} rib injury sustained in July, Walker was released by the Blue Stockings on September 22, 1884. During the offseason, Walker took a position as a mail clerk, but returned to baseball in 1885, playing in the Western League for 18 games. For {{the second half of}} 1885, he joined the baseball club in Waterbury for 10 games. When the season ended, Walker reunited with Weldy in Cleveland to assume the <b>proprietorship</b> of the LeGrande House, an opera theater and hotel. According to Zang, Walker could afford the business venture after commanding a $2,000 contract as a major leaguer. Though he could no longer negotiate such a salary, his skills were still highly attractive to teams: Walker returned to Waterbury in 1886 when the team joined the more competitive Eastern League.|$|E

25|$|Post-financial {{crisis and}} several {{spectacular}} fund governance failures, {{there has been}} much debate among fund directors worldwide about whether the <b>proprietorship</b> or professional firm approach is best for a professional fund. The matter has also been studied extensively by leading independent academic researchers at the Stanford Law Review, University of Kentucky and University of Cambridge among many others. Collectively these independent studies shattered many of the myths about professional fund governance and consistently supported the professional firm model over the proprietor model. Currently there is no independent research that supports the <b>proprietorship</b> model. In the Stanford Law Review, the authors argue “we know of no other service provided for corporations that is obligated by law to be performed by a sole <b>proprietorship,</b> and for good reason. Lawyers, consultants, accountants, doctors, and so on, all associate with each other to form corporate entities to provide their services for a host of well understood reasons".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{asks how}} the {{performance}} of self-employed unincorporated businesses affects {{the size of the}} gap in labour productivity between Canada and the United States. To do so, the business sector in each country is divided into unincorporated and corporate businesses, and estimates of labour productivity are generated for each sector. The productivity performance of the unincorporated sector relative to the corporate sector is much lower in Canada than in the United States. As a result, when the unincorporated sector is removed from the estimates for the business sector in each country and only the corporate sectors for the two countries are compared, the gap in the level of productivity between Canada and the United States is reduced. The unincorporated sector consists of both sole <b>proprietorships</b> and partnerships. This paper also investigates the impact of just sole <b>proprietorships</b> on the Canada-United States productivity gap. Sole <b>proprietorships</b> in the two countries more closely resemble one another than do partnerships, as U. S. partnerships are much larger than their Canadian counterparts. When sole <b>proprietorships</b> are removed from the business-sector estimates of each country (allowing a comparison of sole <b>proprietorships</b> {{to the rest of the}} business sector, which consists of partnerships and the corporate sector), the gap in labour productivity between Canada and the United States also declines but by only about half as much as when both sole <b>proprietorships</b> and partnerships are removed. The lower productivity of the unincorporated sector (both sole <b>proprietorships</b> and partnerships) accounted for almost the entire productivity gap between Canada and the United States in 1998. Since then, the productivity of the corporate sector in Canada has fallen relative to that of the corporate sector in the United States and the unincorporated sector no longer accounts for the entire gap.
