This centre was named [...] "Fundanami" [...] by the learners of the school. [...] "Fundanami" [...] is an Isizulu word meaning [...] "Learn With Me". Construction began in May 2008 and completed in November 2008. The Centre was officially opened on 19 March 2009 in a function graced by many local representatives in education as well as the Kwazulu Natal Minister of Education, Ina Cronje. The Centre's first manager was Mrs E. Hendricks.The centre aims to be a multimedia and literacy hub. Literacy, being a major problem in the school, is tackled by means of a Reading Assistance Programme. Since the start of 2009, reading assists were employed by the Fundanami Trust to assist Grade 8 learners who possess a very low reading age. The learners are identified by means of a Reading Test conducted early in the academic year. Learners who progress in their reading age are rewarded with a <b>Participation</b> <b>Certificate.</b> The first two certificates were presented at the centre's official opening on 19 March 2009 by Mike Wood of the Fundanami Trust.In addition to the Reading Programme, the centre is also utilized for a period called [...] "Special English" [...] (for Grades 8 to 12) - basically a Library Period where learners are encouraged to borrow books and read.|$|E

40|$|Mortgage-backed securities, {{with their}} {{relative}} structural simplicity and {{their lack of}} recovery rate uncertainty if default occurs, are particularly suitable for developing and testing risky debt valuation models. In this paper, we develop a two-factor structural mortgage pricing model in which rational mortgage-holders endogenously choose when to prepay and default subject to i. explicit frictions (transaction costs) payable when terminating their mortgages, ii. exogenous background terminations, and iii. a credit related impact of the loan-to-value ratio (LTV) on prepayment. We estimate the model using pool-level mortgage termination data for Freddie Mac <b>Participation</b> <b>Certificates,</b> and find {{that the effect of}} the house price factor on the results is both statistically and economically significant. Out-of-sample estimates of MBS prices produce option adjusted spreads of between 5 and 25 basis points, well within quoted values for these securities...|$|R
