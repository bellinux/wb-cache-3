In this paper, we describe a <b>plain</b> <b>indexing</b> method for accumulating diverse information originating from heterogeneous natural information sources. We present a couple of heuristic techniques: (a) orthogonal decomposition which allows for reorganizing a given information base into a Cartesian product of primitive concepts, and (b) analogical refinement which enables further elaboration based on the measurement of similarity. The proposal is implemented and evaluated against sample information bases containing about a few thousands conceptual units. We discuss the strength and weakness of the method based on the analysis of experimental results.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the relationship between fish assemblage structure and habitat in streams dominated by an agricultural landscape. Fishes from 20 natural and 20 channelized streams were sampled using electrofishing gear in East Central Indiana. Streams that had been channelized had a lower quality fish assemblage when compared to natural streams as measured by the Indiana V. Eastern Corn Belt <b>Plain</b> <b>Index</b> of Biotic Integrity (IBI). Stream habitat was evaluated using the Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI), which indicated that channelized streams had lower quality primarily due to a loss of heterogeneous habitat. Pearson correlation analysis relating ECB IBI and QHEI was positive and significant, and demonstrated that a reduction in riffle and pool areas associated with channelization was the most significant factor influencing the fish community. Furthermore, species lost when streams are channelized were predictable, and often represented environmentally sensitive species. The results of this study suggested that stream channel alterations have a negative and lasting influence on the fish assemblage which should be recognized prior to any stream development.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} study of the Na I line strength <b>index</b> <b>centered</b> in the K-band at 22100, Å (NaI 2. 21 hereafter) relying on different samples of early-type galaxies. Consistent with previous studies, {{we find that the}} observed line strength indices cannot be fit by state-of-art scaled-solar stellar population models, even using our newly developed models in the NIR. The models clearly underestimate the large NaI 2. 21 values measured for most early-type galaxies. However, we develop a Na-enhanced version of our newly developed models in the NIR, which - together with the effect of a bottom-heavy initial mass function - yield NaI 2. 21 indices in the range of the observations. Therefore, we suggest a scenario in which the combined effect of [Na/Fe] enhancement and a bottom-heavy initial mass function are mainly responsible for the large NaI 2. 21 indices observed for most early-type galaxies. To a smaller extent, also [C/Fe] enhancement might contribute to the large observed NaI 2. 21 values. Comment: 13 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R

Fresh (n = 14) and brackish (n = 12) waters were grouped according to electrical conductivity (threshold = 1000 μS cm − 1) Significant differences in the average DOC and DIC concentrations were observed between the fresh (5. 63 mg L − 1, 37. 39 mg L − 1) and the brackish waters (15. 33 mg L − 1, 142. 93 mg L − 1). Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and DOC concentrations were mainly controlled by climatic–hydrologic conditions. The investigation indicated that the outflow conditions in the semi-arid region had condensed effects on the dissolved carbon, resulting in close relationships between salinity vs. DOC (R 2 = 0. 66), and salinity vs. DIC (R 2 = 0. 94). An independent data set collected in May 2012 also confirmed this finding (DOC: R 2 = 0. 79, DIC: R 2 = 0. 91), highlighting the potential of quantifying DOC and DIC via salinity measurements for waters dispersed in the <b>plain.</b> <b>Indices</b> based on the CDOM absorption spectra (e. g., the DOC-specific CDOM absorption (SUVA 254), absorption ratio a 250 : a 365 (E 250 : E 365) and the spectral slope ratio (Sr, S 275 − 295 / S 350 − 400) were applied to characterize CDOM composition and quality.
