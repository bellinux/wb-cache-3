While Vickers chose to continue with the project, negative perceptions, fuelled by progress having been slowed by work on the Wellington and the lack of suitable engines, led to a growing official expectation that the design would be surpassed by later aircraft.|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundAccording to {{practice}} guidelines, educational programmes {{for patients with}} COPD should address several educational topics. Which topics are incorporated in the existing programmes remains unclear. ObjectivesTo delineate educational topics integrated in current COPD management interventions; and to examine strengths, weaknesses, and methods of delivery of the educational <b>programmes.</b> <b>Data</b> sourcesA systematic literature search was performed using MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Clinical Trials, and Web of Science. The authors of included studies were contacted for additional information. Study selectionStudies that contained educational programmes incorporated in COPD management interventions were included. Data extractionData were extracted using a pre-designed data form. The Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework was used for evaluating {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the <b>programmes.</b> <b>Data</b> synthesisIn total, 81 articles, describing 67 interventions were included. The majority (53. 8 %) of the studies incorporated 10 or more educational topics. The following topics were frequently addressed: smoking cessation (80. 0 %); medication (76. 9 %); exercise (72. 3 %); breathing strategies (70. 8 %); exacerbations (69. 2 %); and stress management (67. 7 %). Printed material and/or brochure (90. 5 %) and demonstrations and practice (73. 8 %), were the predominant tool and method, respectively. Nurses (75. 8 %), physicians (37. 9 %) and physiotherapists (34. 8 %) were the most involved healthcare professionals. ConclusionsHeterogeneity and wide variation in the content and the method of delivery of educational interventions were present. Alignment between educational topics incorporated in the existing programmes and those recommended by the COPD guidelines, involvement of various professionals and combined use of methods should be emphasised...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a single}} case study of {{undergraduate}} business curriculum design and pedagogic practice in a post- 1992 university business school (UBS). The central {{aim of the research}} was to investigate the factors that combined to influence the design and enactment of the BA Business Studies and BA Entrepreneurship and Innovation <b>programmes.</b> <b>Data</b> were collected using semi-structured interviews with academics from the department of Systems and Management and a documentary review of <b>programme</b> texts. The <b>data</b> were analysed within an analytical framework which brings together Bhaskar's critical realism, Fairclough's critical discourse analysis and Bernstein's theory of the pedagogic device. This thesis contends that the undergraduate curriculum in UBS has become recontextualised as a business project which frames knowledge as a commodity for the purposes of income generation, pedagogy as a rational, 'quality-assured' system for its 'delivery' and academics as the 'deliverers'. The pedagogic codes which underpin this model legitimise knowledge as narrow projections of business practices and confine didactics to behaviourist, sometimes incoherent, approaches to knowledge generation predicated on 'employability' and 'transferable skills'...|$|R
