It supports metadata, including dialog normalization and Dynamic Range Control.|$|E
40|$|Plasma {{catalysis}} {{is gaining}} increasing interest for CO 2 conversion, but {{the interaction between}} the plasma and catalyst is still poorly understood. This is caused by limited systematic materials research, since most works combine a plasma with commercial supported catalysts and packings. In the present paper, we study the influence of specific material and reactor properties, as well as reactor/bead configuration, on the conversion and energy efficiency of CO 2 dissociation in a packed bed dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor. Of the various packing materials investigated, BaTiO 3 yields the highest conversion and energy efficiency, i. e. 25 % and 4. 5 %. Our results show that, when evaluating the influence of catalysts, the impact of the <b>packing</b> (<b>support)</b> material itself cannot be neglected, since it can largely affect the conversion and energy efficiency. This shows the large potential for further improvement of packed bed plasma reactors for CO 2 conversion and other chemical conversion reactions by adjusting both <b>packing</b> (<b>support)</b> properties and catalytically active sites. Moreover, we clearly prove that comparison of results obtained in different reactor setups should be done with care, since there is a large effect of the reactor setup and reactor/bead configuration.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} new FPGA logic blocks, FPGA ar-chitects have traditionally needed to customize CAD tools {{to make use}} of the new features and characteristics of those blocks. The software development effort necessary to cre-ate such CAD tools can be a time-consuming process that can significantly limit the number and variety of architec-tures explored. Thus, architects want flexible CAD tools that can, with few or no software modifications, explore a diverse space. Existing flexible CAD tools suffer from im-practically long runtimes and/or fail to efficiently make use of the important new features of the logic blocks being in-vestigated. This work is a step towards addressing these concerns by enhancing the packing stage of the open-source VTR CAD flow [17] to efficiently deal with common inter-connect structures that are used to create many kinds of use-ful novel blocks. These structures include crossbars, carry chains, dedicated signals, and others. To accomplish this, we employ three techniques in this work: speculative pack-ing, pre-packing, and interconnect-aware pin counting. We show that these techniques, along with three minor modi-fications, result in improvements to runtime and quality of results across a spectrum of architectures, while simultane-ously expanding the scope of architectures that can be ex-plored. Compared with VTR 1. 0 [17], we show an average 12 -fold speedup in packing for fracturable LUT architectures with 20 % lower minimum channel width and 6 % lower crit-ical path delay. We obtain a 6 to 7 -fold speedup for archi-tectures with non-fracturable LUTs and architectures with depopulated crossbars. In addition, we demonstrate <b>packing</b> <b>support</b> for logic blocks with carry chains...|$|E
