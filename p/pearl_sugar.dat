25|$|The Liège waffle is a richer, denser, sweeter, and chewier waffle. Native to {{the greater}} Wallonia region of Eastern Belgium – and {{alternately}} known as gaufres de chasse (hunting waffles) – they are an adaptation of brioche bread dough, featuring chunks of <b>pearl</b> <b>sugar</b> which caramelize {{on the outside of}} the waffle when baked. It is the most common type of waffle available in Belgium and prepared in plain, vanilla and cinnamon varieties by street vendors across the nation.|$|E
25|$|Liège waffles, {{the most}} popular {{contemporary}} Belgian waffle variety, are rumored to have been invented during the 18th century, as well, by the chef to the prince-bishop of Liège. However, there are no German, French, Dutch, or Belgian cookbooks that contain references to them in this period – by any name – nor are there any waffle recipes that mention the Liège waffle's distinctive ingredients, brioche-based dough and <b>pearl</b> <b>sugar.</b> It is not until 1814 that Antoine Beauvilliers publishes a recipe in l'Art du Cuisiner where brioche dough is introduced as {{the base of the}} waffle and sucre cassé (crushed block sugar) is used as a garnish for the waffles, though not worked into the dough. Antonin Carême, the famous Parisian pastry chef, is the first to incorporate gros sucre into several waffle variations named in his 1822 work, Le Maitre d'Hotel Français. Then, in 1834, Leblanc publishes a complete recipe for gaufres grêlées (hail waffles), where gros sucre is mixed in. A full Gaufre de Liège recipe does not appear until 1921.|$|E
2500|$|Germans eat a Three Kings cake {{which may}} be a golden pastry ring filled with orange and spice {{representing}} gold, frankincense and myrrh. Most often found in Switzerland, these cakes {{take the form of}} Buchteln but for Epiphany, studded with citron, and baked as seven large buns in a round rather than square pan, forming a crown. Or they may be made of typical rich Christmas bread dough with cardamom and <b>pearl</b> <b>sugar</b> in the same seven bun crown shape. These varieties are most typically purchased in supermarkets with the trinket, and gold paper crown included. As in other countries, the person who receives the piece or bun containing the trinket or whole almond becomes the king or queen for a day. Epiphany is also an especially joyful occasion for the young and young at heart as this is the day dedicated to plündern – that is, when Christmas trees are [...] "plundered" [...] of their cookies and sweets by eager children (and adults) and when gingerbread houses, and any other good things left in the house from Christmas are devoured. Lastly, there is a German rhyme saying, or Bauernregel, that goes Ist's bis Dreikönigs kein Winter, kommt keiner dahinter meaning [...] "If there hasn't been any Winter (weather) until Epiphany, none is coming afterward." [...] Another of these Bauernregel, (German farmer's rules) for Epiphany states: Dreikönigsabend hell und klar, verspricht ein gutes Weinjahr or [...] "If the eve of Epiphany is bright and clear, it foretells a good wine year." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Spanish {{treasure}} fleet, or West Indies Fleet from Spanish Flota de Indias, {{also called}} silver fleet or plate fleet (from the Spanish plata meaning [...] "silver"), was a convoy system {{adopted by the}} Spanish Empire from 1566 to 1790, linking Spain with its territories in America across the Atlantic. The convoys were general purpose cargo fleets used for transporting {{a wide variety of}} items, including agricultural goods, lumber, various metal resources, luxuries, silver, gold, gems, <b>pearls,</b> spices, <b>sugar,</b> tobacco, silk, and other exotic goods from the Spanish Empire to the Spanish mainland. Passengers and goods such as textiles, books and tools were transported in the opposite direction. The West Indies fleet was the first permanent transatlantic trade route in history. Similarly, the Manila galleons were the first permanent trade route across the Pacific.|$|R
50|$|Agriculture {{is almost}} entirely {{dependent}} on angiosperms, which provide virtually all plant-based food, and also provide {{a significant amount of}} livestock feed. Of all the families of plants, the Poaceae, or grass family (grains), {{is by far the most}} important, providing the bulk of all feedstocks (rice, corn — maize, wheat, barley, rye, oats, <b>pearl</b> millet, <b>sugar</b> cane, sorghum). The Fabaceae, or legume family, comes in second place. Also of high importance are the Solanaceae, or nightshade family (potatoes, tomatoes, and peppers, among others), the Cucurbitaceae, or gourd family (also including pumpkins and melons), the Brassicaceae, or mustard plant family (including rapeseed and the innumerable varieties of the cabbage species Brassica oleracea), and the Apiaceae, or parsley family. Many of our fruits come from the Rutaceae, or rue family (including oranges, lemons, grapefruits, etc.), and the Rosaceae, or rose family (including apples, pears, cherries, apricots, plums, etc.).|$|R
50|$|It {{is known}} as pärlsocker (<b>pearl</b> <b>sugar)</b> in Sweden, and as perlesukker in other Scandinavian countries. In Finland it is called raesokeri ("hailstone sugar") or rarely helmisokeri (also <b>pearl</b> <b>sugar).</b>|$|E
5000|$|A chouquette (...) {{is a type}} of Choux pastry {{consisting}} of a small portion of dough sprinkled with <b>pearl</b> <b>sugar</b> and sometimes filled with custard or mousse. A chouquette can also be dipped in chocolate or covered in chocolate chips.|$|E
50|$|Sanding {{sugar is}} a {{transparent}} crystal sugar of larger size than general-use refined white sugar. Crystal sugar {{tends to be}} clear and of much larger crystals than sanding sugar. <b>Pearl</b> <b>sugar</b> is relatively large, opaque white spheroids of sugar. Both crystal and pearl sugars are typically used for sprinkling on sweet breads, pastries, and cookies in many countries.|$|E
25|$|The {{fortification}} Fortaleza San Felipe, {{which was}} built in the 16th century and served as a prison under Rafael Trujillo's dictatorship, lies close to the port of Puerta Plata. The amber museum, is also a well-known attraction in this city. La Isabela, a settlement built by Christopher Columbus, is located near Puerto Plata. In April 1563, the Spanish settlement became notorious when the English slave trader, Sir John Hawkins, brought 400 people he had abducted from Sierra Leone. Hawkins traded his victims with the Spanish for <b>pearls,</b> hides and <b>sugars,</b> some gold. This was the start of British involvement in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, in which 20 million people were forced into slavery.|$|R
5000|$|In the UK, [...] "sago pudding" [...] is {{generally}} made by boiling <b>pearl</b> sago and <b>sugar</b> in milk until the sago pearls become clear, and thickening it with eggs or cornflour. Depending on the proportions used it {{can range from}} a runny consistency to fairly thick, and can be similar to tapioca pudding or rice pudding.In Northern England [...] "sago pudding" [...] {{is referred to as}} [...] "frog spawn" [...] as it is made using pearl sago. Tapioca pudding is similar in that it too can be made using pearl tapioca (in London and district where it is called [...] "frog spawn") but {{is generally}} made using flake tapioca in the north which results in a finer, more grainy, consistency.|$|R
50|$|After 1625, the Dutch carried {{sugarcane}} from South America to the Caribbean islands, {{where it}} was grown from Barbados to the Virgin Islands. Contemporaries often compared the worth of sugar with valuable commodities including musk, <b>pearls,</b> and spices. <b>Sugar</b> prices declined slowly as its production became multi-sourced, especially through British colonial policy. Formerly an indulgence of only the rich, the consumption of sugar also became increasingly common among the poor too. Sugar production increased in mainland North American colonies, in Cuba, and in Brazil. The labour force at first included European indentured servants and local Native American slaves. However, European diseases such as smallpox and African ones such as malaria and yellow fever soon reduced the numbers of local Native Americans. Europeans were also very susceptible to malaria and yellow fever, and the supply of indentured servants was limited. African slaves became the dominant source of plantation workers because they were more resistant to malaria and yellow fever, and because the supply of slaves was abundant on the African coast.|$|R
50|$|Nib sugar (also <b>pearl</b> <b>sugar</b> and hail sugar) is {{a product}} of refined white sugar. The sugar is very coarse, hard, opaque white, and does not melt at {{temperatures}} typically used for baking. The product usually is made by crushing blocks of white sugar, then sifting to obtain fragments of a given diameter. The sugar may also be made in an extrusion process.|$|E
50|$|The dough for the colomba {{is made in}} {{a similar}} manner to panettone, with flour, eggs, sugar, natural yeast and butter; unlike panettone, it usually {{contains}} candied peel and no raisins. The dough is then fashioned into a dove shape (colomba in Italian) and finally is topped with <b>pearl</b> <b>sugar</b> and almonds before being baked. Some manufacturers produce other versions including a popular bread topped with chocolate.|$|E
5000|$|On Easter Sunday, lamb {{is served}} {{throughout}} Italy. A typical Easter Sunday breakfast in Umbria and Tuscany includes salami, boiled eggs, wine, Easter Cakes and pizza. The common cake for Easter Day is the Colomba Pasquale (literally, Easter dove), {{which is often}} simply known as [...] "Italian Easter cake" [...] abroad. It is supposed to represent the dove, and is topped with almonds and <b>pearl</b> <b>sugar.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Danish {{pastries}} as {{consumed in}} Denmark have different shapes and names. Some are topped with chocolate, <b>pearl</b> <b>sugar,</b> glacé icing and/or slivered nuts {{and they may}} be stuffed with a variety of ingredients such as jam or preserves (usually apple or prune), remonce, marzipan and/or custard. Shapes are numerous, including circles with filling in the middle (known in Denmark as [...] "Spandauers"), figure-eights, spirals (known as snails), and the pretzel-like kringles.|$|E

5000|$|Popular {{terminology}} {{for this}} confection tends to overlap, while manufacturers are more precise with their labeling. What consumers often call [...] "sprinkles" [...] covers {{several types of}} candy decorations that are sprinkled randomly over a surface, as opposed to decorations that are placed in specific spots. Nonpareils, confetti, silver, gold, and pearl dragées - {{not to be confused}} with <b>pearl</b> <b>sugar</b> (which is also sprinkled on baked goods) - and hundreds-and-thousands are all used this way, along with a newer product called [...] "sugar shapes" [...] or [...] "sequins". These latter come in a variety of shapes, often flavored, for holidays or themes, such as Halloween witches and pumpkins, or flowers and dinosaurs. Candy cane shapes may taste like peppermint, and gingerbread men like gingerbread cookies.|$|E
