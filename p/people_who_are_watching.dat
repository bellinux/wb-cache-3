The rest concerns nobody but myself.

5000|$|The {{ideal that}} younger actresses {{are better than}} older actresses in Hollywood {{can be seen by}} the {{preferences}} of the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> movies. Movie spectators display discrimination against older women in Hollywood. A study between 1926-1999 proved that older men in Hollywood had more leading roles than women who were the same age as them. [...] There are many cases where leading actors play the attractive love interest for longer than women. This portrayal of women never aging but men aging can have a negative affect on not only actresses in Hollywood but also women who are not in the media. [...] There are fewer older actresses that get leading roles than young actresses, this promotes the idea that women do not age and that older women are less attractive. This can be harmful to women because they will strive for something that is impossible to have, eternal youth.|$|E

She further said in the same interview that [...] "All our loyal audience for my serial on TV is in London, America, South Africa, Australia.

40|$|Abstract. This paper mainly {{talks about}} the problem of flat television’s {{placement}} and the creative design of this automatic steering bracket which designed on the basis of analyzing the existing brackets and aims to make televisions turning around instantly, conveniently and automatically (instead of never moved or hand operated) for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> TV from whichever angle. It is the working of two small electrical motors drives the rotation of the rack at horizontal direction and vertical direction. And only with the help of its remote control can this automatic steering bracket divert the television. The bracket was made of bigger strength aluminum alloy, it is lighter weight, stainless, surface beautiful, compared with traditional processing methods, and selecting aluminum alloy can remarkably improve the production efficiency, ensure product quality and improve the qualification rate of finished products...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWatching {{television}} on a portable device is possible on broadcast and cellular systems. With broadcast technologies, {{due to the}} absence of a feedback channel {{it is not possible to}} guarantee an error free reception at the receivers. With cellular technologies, the transmission is based on unicast and the same content is transmitted as many times as the number of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> the same program in the cell. We propose to combine both technologies and consider the concept of repairing a broadcast data flow for dual-mode (cellular and broadcast) smartphones in real-time in order to ensure a better quality of service. We propose to use the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) and specify a Real-time Flow Repair (RFR) service based on CoAP in the cellular networks. We describe the architecture to provide such a service. We analyze the load generated in the cellular radio access network due to the retransmission of the packets lost on the broadcast system and also develop a model for the evaluation of the residual errors in the RFR operations...|$|E
40|$|Social {{media has}} become an {{integral}} part of today's society and has continued to grow tremendously throughout the world. People communicate through social media constantly and social media has become a pivotal place for people to gather information related to things that they are interested in. It is also a place for people to express their views to friends, family and followers with just one click of a button immediately. Naturally in society there are a wide range of views encompassing an unlimited amount of subjects. Some of these views can be deemed negative, positive, neutral or maybe even other. My research will attempt to identify the sentimental impact that different views in the form of social interactions online, can have on the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>watching,</b> listening and reading them. Furthermore, I will research how the integration of neutral and positive statements can stimulate positive and productive conversation amongst a community on a small scale as well as a large scale. Analysis of this will be quantified by changes in the overall reaction of the various communities time following intervention. The main contribution of this thesis is to show a correlation between statements with positive or neutral sentiment and a trend towards positive or neutral responses after moderation. Events of large discussion or interest will be evaluated to ensure a significant amount of data is available for analysis. In order to integrate the social aspect into the equation, software will be explored and evaluated or built and then utilized to connect participants and extract the appropriate metrics...|$|E

Titled A Charlie Brown Christmas, it was first aired on the CBS network on December 9, 1965. The special's primary goal is showing [...] "the true meaning of Christmas". Before its broadcast, the people involved in the special's creation were worried that it might be a project blow, with its unorthodox soundtrack and explicit religious message. It was, however, a huge success, with the number of homes watching the special an estimated 15,490,000, placing it at number two in the ratings, behind Bonanza on NBC.; in other words, almost half of the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> television <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> the special. It also received unanimous critical acclaim, and had a large legacy: according to author Charles Solomon, it established the half-hour animated special as a television tradition, inspiring the creation of numerous others, including How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (1966) and Frosty the Snowman, and served as an inspiration for dozens of young aspiring artists and animators, many of whom went on to work within both the comics and animation industries, among them Eric Goldberg (Pocahontas), Pete Docter (Monsters, Inc., Up), Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo, WALL-E), Jef Mallett (Frazz), and Patrick McDonnell (Mutts).
