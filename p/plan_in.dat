40|$|The {{institutions}} {{of land use}} <b>planning</b> <b>in</b> the countries of sub-Saharan Africa have come of age. For more than 40 years, the received colonial town planning laws and associated regulations have guided urban land development processes in the region. In spite {{of the problems of}} ‘illegal’ developments and delays in the procedures for obtaining land and development rights, no economic assessment of the system of land use <b>planning</b> <b>in</b> Africa seems to have been attempted.

40|$|Scenario <b>planning</b> <b>in</b> {{the public}} sector has {{significant}} differences from scenario <b>planning</b> <b>in</b> the corporate world.
