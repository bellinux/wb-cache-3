40|$|In this paper, we {{extend a}} mixed method (MM) {{approach}} to lesson observation and analysis used {{in previous research}} in England, combining multiple structured observation instruments and qualitative field notes, to {{provide a framework for}} studying three videotaped lessons from 3 rd-grade US mathematics classrooms. Two structured observation schedules are employed, one subject-specific and research-oriented and the other generic and inspection-oriented. Both instruments were previously developed based on evidence from the teacher effectiveness research (TER) knowledge base. Qualitative field notes, in addition to structured observations schedules, provide detailed narratives for each lesson video. Separate finding from each instrument and approach are presented, followed by an integrated analysis and synthesis of results. Although previous studies used similar methods to analyse teaching practice within broader research designs incorporating additional methods and perspectives (e. g. teacher interviews, <b>pupil</b> <b>assessments,</b> <b>pupil</b> questionnaires), this paper explicitly examines the strengths and limitations of the multi-instrument, mixed method approach to lesson observation. Using multiple observation instruments allows for triangulation as well as consideration of complementary (i. e. a content-specific instrument measures fine-grained aspects of practice not emphasized in a more generic instrument, and vice versa). Field notes facilitate rich descriptions and more thorough contextualization and illumination of teaching practice than structured observation ratings alone. Further, the MM approach allows for considerations of lesson features beyond those established in TER literature as sufficient to characterize ‘effective’ practice...|$|R

It also investigates the patterns of teachers’ efficacy beliefs at different stages of their careers. In order to answer the research question, a questionnaire were constructed and distributed to 280 teachers in Finland and Sweden. An exploratory factor analysis gave us the following five factors: instructional skills, classroom management, motivating <b>pupils,</b> <b>assessment</b> competence and establishing routines. We used these to compare means between novice teachers, mid-career and late-career teachers. The group of novice teachers estimated all five factors to be lower than did the mid-career and late-career teachers. Patterns of teachers’ efficacy beliefs at different stages showed that novice, mid-career and late-career teachers all estimated their classroom management ability the highest and their ability to assess pupils’ competence in sloyd as second highest. The findings indicated that novice teachers, in particular, lacked opportunities to discuss questions such as how to instruct, how to manage the classroom, how to motivate pupils, how to assess pupils’ knowledge and how to establish routines in a classroom. The findings also indicated that teachers’ self-rated assessment with respect to instructional skills increases up until the middle stages of their career, before flattening out. Finally we found that sloyd teachers in the latter stages of their career had different beliefs about their ability to perform important teaching activities that help pupils to learn sloyd. Consequently, it appears that sloyd teachers with extensive experience are better prepared for day-to-day teaching practice. </p...|$|R

40|$|At the moment, {{the changes}} {{affecting}} school and education are topics of discussion {{more than ever}} before. The new core curriculum for basic education (2014) and digitalization of learning tools serve as major ignitors of discussion: nowadays information and communication technology reach {{the teacher and the}} pupil elsewhere, not just in the ICT class of the school - it moves wirelessly everywhere, backpacks and pockets too. The change in school and in education is not only the new introduction of premises, places or tools but also above all the updating of the teachers' professionality to correspond with today's ideas of good learning and of realizing the curriculum {{as a part of the}} pupil's life. It means the awareness and skills of what today's teaching and learning contain, what kind of learning theory directs operation and how the teacher's own professionality meets these changes. In this article we examine the <b>pupil's</b> <b>assessment</b> as a part of the multi-disciplinary learning process from the points of view of transformational pedagogy (transformational pedagogic, QED) and the core curriculum (2014). The objective is to identify ways which are based on these and methods to develop teaching and learning so that every learner has equal chances to learn, grow and to develop in the environments which support learning whilst developing their cross-disciplinary skills. The article presents and explains one multidisciplinary learning module, Dive into culture through games -learning project, which is based on the learning theory of the new core curriculum 2014. The model of contextual pedagogical approach for learning and the examination of the different dimensions of the teachers' knowledge and skills of the 2000 s (Piispanen & Meriläinen 2013) form a theoretical frame of reference for the learning project.

40|$|AbstractThe {{main and}} most {{important}} purpose of education at all levels is a high quality {{of teaching and learning}} process. Achievements of students have {{become one of the most}} important criteria for determining the quality of education systems in Europe and worldwide. In Slovenia, the results of <b>pupils</b> at National <b>Assessment</b> of Knowledge have two meanings: they provide teachers with additional information about the knowledge of pupils, and they are feedback about the quality of the work at a school. Since the results of Slovenian <b>pupils</b> at National <b>Assessment</b> of Knowledge in statistical regions of the country are very different and decline at the national level from year to year, we are interested in finding out what is going on with the quality of teaching in our schools, what the role of school policy in teachers’ professional development is, what attitudes teachers have towards their own professional development and what kind of competencies teachers develop through their professional development. Our survey wants to determine whether there are links between teachers’ professional development and achievements of <b>pupils</b> at National <b>Assessment</b> of Knowledge in Mathematics and Mother tongue, and which variables of the teachers’ professional development are determined the most by this indicator. Regarding the fact that many researches confirm the impact of teachers’ professional development on the results at National Assessment of Knowledge we expect to find out that teachers’ professional development is an important factor of pupils’ success at National Assessment of Knowledge. We expect to find out that the management approach to the teachers’ professional development in schools with the best results at National Assessment of Knowledge importantly differs from the management approach in schools with poorer results at National Assessment of Knowledge. We believe that teachers in schools with high results at National Assessment of Knowledge express more positive attitudes towards professional development and estimate their own competence development higher than teachers in schools with poorer results at National Assessment of Knowledge...|$|R

The early products of this new preoccupation were prose fragments like Domnișoara Lot ("Miss Lot"), which used intertextuality, reworking themes borrowed from classical works of literature, in a manner also employed at the time by his colleague Jacques G.
