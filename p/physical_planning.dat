40|$|The main {{objective}} of the realization of local <b>physical</b> <b>plan</b> in urban areas is to constitute the healthy urban structure, to provide land development and to regulate the use of private and public land for public interest. The other important objective is to prevent sprawl of city and chaotic growth. The realization of local <b>physical</b> <b>plan</b> is a process which it express the change in an urban area from irregular plots of rural land to urban plots having infrastructure according to local <b>physical</b> <b>plans.</b> The municipalities {{are responsible for the}} realization of local <b>physical</b> urban <b>plans</b> in Turkey. There is not any sufficient research related to realization of local <b>physical</b> <b>plans</b> in urban spaces throughout the Turkey. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate whether there is a relationship between the realization rate of local <b>physical</b> <b>plans</b> and population, population growth rate, socio-economic index, the number of technical personnel, some dummy variables. For this research, a sample survey method is used and 468 questionnaires are completed by Planning Office of the municipalities of urban areas in Turkey. In this model, the index of realization local <b>physical</b> <b>plan</b> are used as a dependent variable and population, population growth rate, global density in urban areas according to detailed plans, adequacy of budgets, socio-economic index, the number of personnel, Multiple Regression Model is utilized for Turkey. The results of the paper can be used to identify the problems concerning the realization of local <b>physical</b> <b>plans</b> and to suggest solutions to these problems based on existing legislation in Turkey in international context. ...|$|R

We take the closed-world assumption, in which views are predicates, as is common when the open-world assumption is used. In the closed-world model, there can be an infinite number of different rewritings that compute the same answer, yet have quite different performance. Query optimizers take a logical plan (a rewriting of the query) as an input, and generate efficient <b>physical</b> <b>plans</b> to compute the answer. Thus our goal is to generate a small subset of the possible logical plans without missing an optimal <b>physical</b> <b>plan.</b> We first consider a cost model that counts the number of subgoals in a <b>physical</b> <b>plan,</b> and show a search space that is guaranteed to include an optimal rewriting, if the query has a rewriting in terms of the views. We also develop an efficient algorithm for finding rewritings with the minimum number of subgoals. We then consider a cost model that counts the sizes of intermediate relations of a <b>physical</b> <b>plan,</b> without dropping any attributes, and give a search space for finding optimal rewritings. Our final cost model allows attributes to be dropped in intermediate relations. We show that, by careful variable renaming, it is possible to do better than the standard “supplementary relation ” approach, by dropping attributes that the latter approach would retain. Experiments show that our algorithm of generating optimal rewritings has good efficiency and scalability. 1...|$|R

Minor subdivisions, land readjustment projects and expropriations in Turkey are primary methods for realizing the subdivision of urban areas.

Firstly, the thesis describes {{the theory of the}} relational query compilers. Secondly, we present the data structures and algorithms used in the implemented tool. Finally, the important implementation details of the developed tool are discussed. Part of the thesis is the selection of used relational algebra operators and design of an appropriate input. Input of the implemented software is a query written in a XML file in the form of relational algebra. Query is optimized and transformed into <b>physical</b> <b>plan</b> which will be executed in the parallelization framework Bobox.
