The U.S. Post office began using a double-line watermark bearing the initials USPS in 1895, when the Bureau of Engraving and Printing introduced it into the previously unwatermarked Bureau Triangles stamp issues. The same double-line watermark paper used then was used on the various issues leading up to and used in the production of the 1908 and 1909 versions of the Washington-Franklin issues. In 1910 the watermark was changed to a single-line watermark and with initials which were smaller in size, partly because the double-line watermark tended to weaken the sheets at the perforations causing premature separation of stamps at the Post Office, and partly because postal officials suspected that the double-line watermark caused the stamp paper to shrink unevenly when the sheets dried after printing.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a spectral control chart {{that is designed}} to detect the onset of cyclic behaviour in a process, even in the presence of multiple cycles. This new spectral control chart is based on the periodogram test proposed by B�lviken (1983 a, b). While no more difficult to implement than the traditional spectral control based on Fisher's test statistic, this new control chart shows improvement in detecting the presence of compound periodicity, which the chart based on Fisher's test is not designed to handle. This is assessed using Monte Carlo simulations to estimate and compare the average run lengths of several spectral control charts. In addition, the spectral control charts are applied to paper production data, published by Pandit & Wu (1993), in which the stock flow and <b>paper</b> <b>thickness</b> are monitored. The application of the new spectral control chart to the stock flow process detects out-of-control behaviour that is not found using standard control charts. This behaviour, in turn, appears to be related to out-of-control behaviour that is observed in the <b>paper</b> <b>thickness</b> measurements later in the production process.

40|$|We propose using THz {{frequency}} selective surfaces interrogated with THz subwavelength {{optical fibers}} as sensors for {{monitoring of the}} optical properties of thick films that are brought in contact with such surfaces. Changes in the test film thickness and absorption losses can be measured simultaneously by interpreting variations in the spectral resonant features in the fiber transmission and reflection spectra. Particularly, changes in the film thickness induce strong shifts in the fiber transmission peaks, while changes in the film absorption induce notable amplitude variations in the fiber reflection peaks.
