25|$|In 1974, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions {{was ranked}} {{as the second}} most {{frequently}} used book in political science courses focused on scope and methods. In particular, Kuhn’s theory {{has been used by}} <b>political</b> <b>scientists</b> to critique behavioralism, which claims that accurate political statements must be both testable and falsifiable. The book also proved popular with <b>political</b> <b>scientists</b> embroiled in debates about whether a set of formulations put forth by a <b>political</b> <b>scientists</b> constituted a theory, or something else.|$|R

5|$|Noam Chomsky, a {{linguist}} and <b>political</b> <b>scientist,</b> surprised many {{by coming}} {{to the defense of}} sociobiology on the grounds that political radicals needed to postulate a relatively fixed idea of human nature {{in order to be able}} to struggle for a better society, claiming that leaders should know what human needs were in order to build a better society.|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{pipeline}} consisting of various text processing tools {{which is designed}} to assist <b>political</b> <b>scientists</b> in finding specific, complex concepts within large amounts of text. Our main focus is the interaction between the <b>political</b> <b>scientists</b> and the natural language processing groups to ensure a beneficial assistance for the <b>political</b> <b>scientists</b> and new application challenges for NLP. It is of particular importance to find a “common language ” between the different disciplines. Therefore, we use an interactive web-interface which is easily usable by non-experts. It interfaces an active learning algorithm which is complemented by the NLP pipeline to provide a rich feature selection. <b>Political</b> <b>scientists</b> are thus enabled to use their own intuitions to find custom concepts. ...|$|R

Egyptian <b>political</b> <b>scientist</b> Alaa al-Din Desouki blamed the 1952 revolution's shortcomings on Nasser's concentration of power, and Egypt's lack of democracy on Nasser's political style and his government's limitations on freedom of expression and political participation.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no mention}} of NATO {{enlargement}} in the September–October 1990 agreements on German reunification, so there was no formal commitment not to expand. Whether or not the West informally committed to not enlarge NATO to the East is a matter of dispute among historians and international relations scholars. Harvard University historian Mark Kramer rejects that an informal agreement existed. Texas A University <b>political</b> <b>scientist</b> Joshua R. Itzkowitz Shifrinson argues that an informal agreement existed.|$|E

There were also claims that {{some members of the}} Ngapa clan were among those who had signed a petition opposing the facility. <b>Political</b> <b>scientist</b> Rebecca Stringer criticised the federal government's approach to the siting of the waste facility, arguing that it undermined the Indigenous owners' sovereignty and control of their own lands.

40|$|In {{this article}} we report the results from a new survey of <b>political</b> <b>scientists</b> {{regarding}} their evaluations of journals in the political science discipline. Unlike previous research that has focused on data from the United States, we conducted an Internet survey of <b>political</b> <b>scientists</b> in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. We present data on journal evaluations, journal familiarity, and journal impact, both for our entire sample (N = 1, 695) and separately for respondents {{from each of the}} three countries. We document the overall hierarchy of scholarly journals among <b>political</b> <b>scientists,</b> though we find important similarities and differences in how <b>political</b> <b>scientists</b> from these three countries evaluate the scholarly journals in the discipline. Our results suggest that there is a strong basis for cross-national integration in scholarly journal communication, though methodological differences among the three countries may be an impediment...|$|R
5|$|According to Croatian <b>political</b> <b>scientist</b> Vladimir Filipović, it {{is unclear}} whether the limited {{resources}} earmarked for the operation and the unclear motivation of CANBAT 1 troops would stop several HV brigades; according to Hague, the plan did not indicate how CANBAT 1 or the other elements of the UNPROFOR would retreat through Croatia after such a clash. Hague questioned the feasibility of Operation Backstop, because the advance-warning requirement was considered impossible to meet. The UNPROFOR had no reliable military intelligence on HV movements outside the UNPAs, or beyond -wide zones around the UNPAs (where only United Nations Military Observers were present). However, Hague considered Operation Backstop a deterrent.|$|E
