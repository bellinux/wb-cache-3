50|$|A {{discontinued}} {{post office}} or DPO is an American <b>postal</b> <b>term</b> for {{a post office}} which has been discontinued. Some are in ghost towns, some victims of consolidation of mail service as small post offices are closed or a city expands. The introduction of Rural Free Delivery, RFD, in 1902 led to the closure of many post offices, which peaked in 1901 at 76,945. In the United States, which was mostly rural, mail previously had been picked up in rural areas at small local post offices, home delivery being limited to urban areas until experimentation with rural delivery began in 1890.|$|E
5000|$|While common usage {{refers to}} {{all types of}} postal {{facilities}} as [...] "substations", the USPS Glossary of <b>Postal</b> <b>Terms</b> does not define or even list that word. Post Offices often share facilities with other governmental organizations located within a city's central business district. In those locations, often Courthouses and Federal Buildings, the building {{is owned by the}} General Services Administration while the U.S. Postal Services operates as a tenant. The USPS retail system has approximately 36,000 post offices, stations, and branches.|$|R

The house number is often part of a <b>postal</b> address. The <b>term</b> describes the number of any building (residential or not) with a mailbox, or even a vacant lot.|$|R
50|$|A {{post box}} (British English; also written postbox), {{also known as}} a {{collection}} box, mailbox, letter box or drop box (American English) is a physical box into which members of the public can deposit outgoing mail intended for collection by the agents of a country's <b>postal</b> service. The <b>term</b> post box can also refer to a private letter box for incoming mail.|$|R
50|$|The <b>term</b> <b>postal</b> card {{is clearly}} {{differentiated}} from the term postcard {{which is a}} term to designate cards prepared by private companies and which do not have prepaid franking. They are readily available at commercial outlets. The addition of an adhesive stamp is required to mail them. They are frequently illustrated with pictures or printed advertisements. They are not considered postal stationery {{any more than a}} plain envelope or sheet of parcel wrapping are.|$|R
2500|$|Postal {{history is}} the study of postal systems and how they operate and, or, the study of the use of postage stamps and covers and {{associated}} postal artifacts illustrating historical episodes in the development of <b>postal</b> systems. The <b>term</b> is attributed to Robson Lowe, a professional philatelist, stamp dealer and stamp auctioneer, who made the first organised study of the subject in the 1930s and described philatelists as [...] "students of science", but postal historians as [...] "students of humanity". [...] More precisely, philatelists describe postal history as the study of rates, routes, markings, and means (of transport).|$|R
40|$|House {{numbering}} is {{the system}} of giving a unique number to each building in a street or area, {{with the intention of}} making it easier to locate a particular building. The house number is often part of a <b>postal</b> address. The <b>term</b> describes the number of any building (residential or not) or vacant lot with a mailbox. House numbering schemes vary by place, and in many cases even within cities. In some areas, especially in rural area of Indonesia, the house or building are not numbered yet. This is caused by the demography and the geography. This study was done on cable TV industries in Sorong Papua, Indonesia. Where the main problem in this research is how {{to reduce the number of}} customer payment arrears and minimize duration of customer dues. There are several aspects of why customers in arrears, on the one hand because of the difficulty of the collector to find the location of the customer and on the other hand due to poor customer habits, so that they do not want to pay. The research model was constructed with a Geographical Information System to determine the mapping customers. The mapping process is done with the customer to establish a classification of association rule between customers. The results of this study could assist companies in finding the location of customers quickly and make the mapping according to customer payment behavior. The approach of the results obtained can be further used to determine the best strategy in dealing with customers...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of {{physical}} burden on selected professions {{at the post}} office The current trend of working conditions tends to reduce the proportion {{of physical}}ly demanding work, but leads to an increased psychological stress in staff members. However, there are professions, such as those involved in postal services, that are still exposed to considerable physical burden. This thesis provides a basic view of health consequences of excessive physical load and manual handling of burdens, it describes specifics of the postman / postwoman profession, specifics in the staff members working in interior post services and those who work at <b>postal</b> counters in <b>terms</b> of physical burden. The objective of this thesis was to survey the physical burden connected with manual load handling {{at the post office}} in Jindrichuv Hradec. The thesis also aims at finding out rehabilitation possibilities for post office staff and proposing ways how to improve the current situation. A questionnaire enquiring about post office staff members´ awareness of musculoskeletal diseases prevention, evaluation of their own health condition and symptoms of fatique caused by physical activity, is a crucial component of my thesis. The results of the questionnaire survey were analyzed and reported in graphs and tables. Measurements of weight and cumulative weight of manually manipulated loads and the workers´ heart rate before and after the physical stress were carried out. I have found that postmen and postwomen and interior post services staff are exposed to great physical strain and frequent handling heavy loads, that in some cases exceed hygienic limits. It was also found that 65...|$|R
40|$|Children’s {{lifestyle}} {{has changed}} significantly {{during the recent}} decades, with an increasing prevalence of obesity as one outcome. Parents are usually the most influential people in young children’s lives. The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate parental perspectives on factors associated with 3 - 6 year-old children’s lifestyle, regarding eating habits and physical activity. Another objective was to compare different approaches to conducting <b>postal</b> questionnaires in <b>terms</b> of response rate, time consumption and cost-efficiency. The samples in the four studies were parents of 6 -year-olds (n= 158), parents of 3 -year-olds (n= 873), parents of 4 -year-olds (n= 30) and parents of 3 -year-olds (n= 353). In the first study, a questionnaire regarding practices and attitudes towards their child’s lifestyle, perceived obstacles and desired support was used. The second study included the Swedish Parenthood Stress Questionnaire (SPSQ), the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) and the CFQ (Child Feeding Questionnaire). Parents also reported their child’s TV-viewing habits. The child’s measured height, weight and BMI were obtained from a register, BASTA. In the third study, focus group interviews were performed. The fourth study investigated three types of consent given for participation in a survey. The results showed that parents’ attitudes towards children’s lifestyle, in general, were “healthier” than their reports of their child’s daily practices. The practices differed depending on the parents’ educational background. Significant and dose-dependant associations were found between perceived maternal stress and children’s overweight, but also underweight. Parents {{felt that they were}} mainly responsible for their preschool child’s lifestyle. However, parents described challenges that limited and obstructed them from providing their child with a healthy lifestyle, citing the need to receive professional and peer support, while also requesting support from society. Allowing respondents to actively decline participation yielded a higher response rate and proved to be the most cost-efficient method for conducting a postal questionnaire...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The Internet is {{increasingly}} {{considered to be}} an efficient medium for assessing the quality of health care seen from the patients' perspective. Potential benefits of Internet surveys such as time efficiency, reduced effort, and lower costs should be balanced against potential weaknesses such as low response rates and accessibility for only a subset of potential participants. Combining an Internet questionnaire with a traditional paper follow-up questionnaire (mixed-mode survey) can possibly compensate for these weaknesses and provide an alternative to a postal survey. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether there are differences between a mixed-mode survey and a <b>postal</b> survey in <b>terms</b> of respondent characteristics, response rate and time, quality of data, costs, and global ratings of health care or health care providers (general practitioner, hospital care in the diagnostic phase, surgeon, nurses, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hospital care in general). METHODS: Differences between the two surveys were examined in a sample of breast care patients using the Consumer Quality Index Breast Care questionnaire. We selected 800 breast care patients from the reimbursement files of Dutch health insurance companies. We asked 400 patients to fill out the questionnaire online followed by a paper reminder (mixed-mode survey) and 400 patients, matched by age and gender, received the questionnaire by mail only (postal survey). Both groups received three reminders. RESULTS: The respondents to the two surveys did not differ in age, gender, level of education, or self-reported physical and psychological health (all Ps >. 05). In the postal survey, the questionnaires were returned 20 days earlier than in the mixed-mode survey (median 12 and 32 days, respectively; P <. 001), whereas the response rate did not differ significantly (256 / 400, 64. 0 % versus 242 / 400, 60. 5 %, respectively; P =. 30). The costs were lower for the mixed-mode survey (€ 2 per questionnaire). Moreover, there were fewer missing items (3. 4 % versus 4. 4 %, P =. 002) and fewer invalid answers (3. 2 % versus 6. 2 %, P <. 001) in the mixed-mode survey than in the postal survey. The answers of the two respondent groups on the global ratings did not differ. Within the mixed-mode survey, 52. 9 % (128 / 242) of the respondents filled out the questionnaire online. Respondents who filled out the questionnaire online were significantly younger (P <. 001), were more often highly educated (P =. 002), and reported better psychological health (P =. 02) than respondents who filled out the paper questionnaire. Respondents to the paper questionnaire rated the nurses significantly more positively than respondents to the online questionnaire (score 9. 2 versus 8. 4, respectively; χ(2) (1) = 5. 6). CONCLUSIONS: Mixed-mode surveys are an alternative method to postal surveys that yield comparable response rates and groups of respondents, at lower costs. Moreover, quality of health care was not rated differently by respondents to the mixed-mode or postal survey. Researchers should consider using mixed-mode surveys instead of postal surveys, especially when investigating younger or more highly educated populations. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|Context: This {{study was}} founded {{on the notion that}} {{opportunities}} for individuals to improve their knowledge of and appreciation for design should be accessible to a broad population. If design is considered a driver in the development of environments that people encounter as part of their everyday activities, they may learn about design from those encounters. With a visual database of environments that include positive design examples, the population will benefit. Firstly, they have the capacity to use their informed encounters to contribute with some authority to discourse that shapes the future of their individual and collective surroundings. Secondly, they hold a greater expectation for design which can increase economic activity through design-related industry. Aim: The Australian post office (PostShop) was chosen as an example of an everyday environment that has the capacity to capture a large audience, due to an ever-increasing and proven catchment of the population-currently one in eighteen Australians will visit each day. To understand the role of design in the PostShop environment it is essential to understand the process through which the environment is developed, and those criteria that drive the final outcome. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the extent to which the key development drivers of the PostShop influence the inclusion of design as a driver. Background: To enable this investigation to take place within an established context, a review of background literature was undertaken. This included themes supporting design literacy; the history of the PostShop built environment; brand; fitout and landlord guidelines for the built environment; global postal models; organisational behaviour; the development process; and the role of design in improving economic growth. Methodology: The qualitative approach was used during the research undertaken in this study. Semi-structured interviews were held with participants from Australia Post and other (external) organisations to capture data relating to the development process of the Postshop, and the role of design in that process. This data was categorised and coded according to themes that emerged from the interview data. This allowed the reduction of data for analysis and presentation. The presentation is primarily rich narrative descriptions and includes responses from interview participants. Key findings: The data uncovered thirty-three individual drivers that have contributed to the development of the postal environment over time. These drivers were presented to illustrate their changing importance over time, from early traditional post offices through to the current PostShop. Seventeen drivers were considered to be relevant today. These were distilled to four chief driver groups that influence the current PostShop. In rank order, these are : financial motivation: including minimisation of rental outgoings, capital fitout costs and business downtime during refurbishment; and queue operation organisational behaviour: including authority of internal opinion: and competition and personal imprimatur brand strategy: including the desire to be a modern retailer; national and tiered fitout standards; and measurement of the built environment as a brand medium external authority: including postal and other industry models; government pressure; and landlord guidelines. Conclusions: The aim of this study was to investigate the extent to which the key development drivers of the PostShop influence the inclusion of design as a driver. It was concluded that: all chief driver groups limit opportunities for design to contribute as a driver towards enhanced PostShop success. Despite being one of the leading international <b>postal</b> providers in <b>terms</b> of economic results, the chief drivers fail to embrace further potential for economic growth. The chief drivers also prevent the PostShop acting as an everyday environment that could successfully enhance the design literacy of the one million Australians that visit each day...|$|R
