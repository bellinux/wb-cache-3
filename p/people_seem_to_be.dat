25|$|Direct reciprocity. Research {{shows that}} it can be {{beneficial}} to help others if there is a chance that they can and will reciprocate the help. The effective tit for tat strategy is one game theoretic example. Many <b>people</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> following a similar strategy by cooperating if and only if others cooperate in return.|$|E
500|$|SFScope {{contributor}} Sarah Stegall liked Frank's final conversation concerning Fauxlivia's pregnancy, {{praising the}} plot twist's potential to [...] "make for some interesting drama, perhaps even allowing {{the show to}} get past the inevitable mawkishness of most pregnancy stories." [...] However, there was some negative fan feedback concerning the pregnancy storyline. In reaction to this, Jeff Pinkner commented, [...] "Our interpretation of it is that people desperately want to see Olivia and Peter together. And that Fauxlivia having a baby makes Olivia’s life that much harder and people are angry because of that. Anything that makes Olivia’s life harder, <b>people</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> angry at. Olivia is a hero, she will conquer all. She’ll deal." [...] After [...] "Immortality" [...] aired, Joshua Jackson expressed sympathy for fans of the Olivia-Peter relationship, commenting that they [...] "have been taken for quite a ride. He [...] wants to be with her , and in his mind it was her. But in her mind, he {{should have been able to}} tell the difference." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tone-deaf <b>people</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{disabled}} {{only when}} it comes to music as they can fully interpret the prosody or intonation of human speech. [...] Tone deafness has a strong negative correlation with belonging to societies with tonal languages. This could be evidence that the ability to reproduce and distinguish between notes may be a learned skill; conversely, it may suggest that the genetic predisposition towards accurate pitch discrimination may influence the linguistic development of a population towards tonality. A correlation between allele frequencies and linguistic typological features has been recently discovered, supporting the latter hypothesis.|$|E
2500|$|It is now largely {{agreed that}} Dynastic Egyptians were {{indigenous}} to the Nile area. About 5,000 years ago, the Sahara area dried out, {{and part of}} the indigenous Saharan population retreated east towards the Nile Valley. In addition, peoples from the Middle East entered the Nile Valley, bringing with them wheat, barley, sheep, goats, and possibly cattle. Dynastic Egyptians referred to their country as [...] "The Two Lands". During the Predynastic period (about 4800 to 4300BC), the Merimde culture flourished {{in the northern part of}} Egypt (Lower Egypt). This culture, among others, has links to the Levant in the Middle East. The pottery of the later Buto Maadi culture, best known from the site at Maadi near Cairo, also shows connections to the southern Levant. In the southern part of Egypt (Upper Egypt), the predynastic Badarian culture was followed by the Naqada culture. These <b>people</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more closely related to the Nubians than to northern Egyptians.|$|E
2500|$|Parche {{was charged}} {{following}} the incident, {{but was not}} jailed because he {{was found to be}} psychologically abnormal, and was instead sentenced to two years' probation and psychological treatment. The incident prompted {{a significant increase in the}} level of security at tour events. At that year's Wimbledon, the players seats were positioned with their backs to the umpire's chair, rather than the spectators. Seles, however, disputed the effectiveness of these measures. She was quoted in 2011 as saying [...] "From the time I was stabbed, I think the security hasn't changed". Seles vowed never to play tennis in Germany again, disenchanted by the German legal system. [...] "What <b>people</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> forgetting is that this man stabbed me intentionally and he did not serve any sort of punishment for it... I would not feel comfortable going back. I don't foresee that happening." [...] In a later article, Tennis.com reported that Parche was living in nursing homes due to additional health problems.|$|E

60|$|The {{sounds of}} a trumpet in some {{neighboring}} street now became so evident and continual, that Robin's curiosity was strongly excited. In addition to the shouts, he heard frequent bursts from many instruments of discord, and a wild and confused laughter filled up the intervals. Robin rose from the steps, and looked wistfully towards a point whither <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hastening.|$|R
60|$|Another evil, which, in my opinion, {{deserves the}} public care, is the ill {{management}} of the bogs; the neglect whereof is a much greater mischief to this kingdom than most <b>people</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aware of.|$|E

60|$|But, on the {{publication}} of the book <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less struck with these high aims of the author than with their own opinion, first, that the novel was an 'improper' one in its morals, and, secondly, that it <b>was</b> intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a satire on the Established Church of this country.

50|$|Burial {{customs of}} the Saugeen people <b>were</b> similar <b>to</b> {{those of the}} nearby Point Peninsula Complex.

The main distinction between the Saugeen complex and the nearby Point Peninsula Complex <b>peoples</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> that Saugeen ceramics were cruder in construction and decoration.|$|R

50|$|In one noted case in 2011, actress Patricia Arquette quit Facebook after alleged cyberstalking.

50|$|The Soviet {{government}} itself said very little publicly about {{the change in}} the law, and few <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aware that it existed. In 1934, the British Communist Harry Whyte wrote a long letter to Stalin condemning the law, and its prejudicial motivations. He laid out a Marxist position against the oppression of homosexuals, as a social minority, and compared homophobia to racism, xenophobia and sexism. The letter was not formally replied to.|$|R
60|$|On {{the further}} {{side of the}} water the entire Asiki <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gathered, at least there were {{thousands}} of them seated upon a rising rocky slope as in an amphitheatre, clad only in the ordinary costume of the Western African native, and in some instances in linen cloaks.

40|$|The new-found {{popularity}} of generalism {{as a political}} force has emphasized the need to clarify the essential philosophy that underpins its practice, teaching, and research. Drawing on the example of Sir James Mackenzie, the author seeks to clarify certain essential issues that need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> emphasized if we <b>are</b> <b>to</b> promote and develop general practice as a distinct academic discipline. Dissatisfaction, uncertainty about our role, and continuing contact with real <b>people</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> essential <b>to</b> continuing creativity...|$|R
