5|$|After Poland regained independence, provincial sejms were {{restored}} in the Second Polish Republic, {{although they were}} called sejms rather than sejmiks. They included the short-lived Sejm of Central Lithuania (1921–1922); the three voivodeship sejms (Silesian Parliament, Greater Poland Sejm, and Pomeranian Sejm, 1920–1939), which <b>preserved</b> <b>the</b> tradition of sejmiks in the former Prussian partition; and the county sejmiks, of which there were 264 in 1939.
