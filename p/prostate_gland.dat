She wrote in sadness, but he never read the letter; she received a call {{in the middle of}} the night that Berkman was in great distress. She left for Nice immediately but when she arrived that morning, Goldman found that he had shot himself and was in a nearly comatose paralysis. He died later that evening.|$|E
40|$|The zinc {{concentration}} in the male genital organs of the normal canines and humans was measured. In human, zinc concentration of the normal <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> was {{compared with that of}} the hypertrophic <b>prostate</b> <b>glands.</b> For the zinc of the canine <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> and human hypertrophic <b>prostate</b> <b>glands,</b> an in vitro study was made to determine concentration of about the zinc in the prostate by using 2 Na-EDTA, a Zn-chelating agent. Further, in addition to the histological study, an in vivo study was made to investigate concentration of zinc in the prostate, for the canine <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> by the local injection of 2 Na-EDTA and for the human hypertrophic <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> by the local injection of Ca- 2 Na-EDTA. EDTA, a Zn-chelating agent. Further, in addition to the histological study, an in vivo study was made to investigate concentration of zinc in the prostate, for the canine <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> by the local injection of 2 Na-EDTA and for the human hypertrophic <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> by the local injection of Ca- 2 Na-EDTA. The results obtained are as follows: 1) As to the zinc {{concentration in}} the male genital organs of the normal canines, the <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> showed the highest value of 986 µg/gd. w. in average, while testis and epididymis 93. 1, 61. 1 µg/gd. w. respectively. Nextly, as far as the zinc {{concentration in the}} male genital organs of the normal human and the human hypertrophic <b>prostate</b> <b>glands,</b> the hypertrophic <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> showed the highest value of 808. 3 µg/gd. w. in average, while the normal prostate, epididymis and testis 302. 7, 65. 5 and 61. 9 µg/gd. w. respectively. 2) In vitro zinc deprivation study in the canine <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> and the human hypertrophic <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> revealed, the ratio of zinc reduction of the 2 Na-EDTA treatment group against the control group in the canine <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> to be 52. 2 %, while that in the hypertrophic <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> 71. 1 %. 3) Local injections of 2 Na-EDTA into the canine <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> were performed in three concentrations of 0. 02 %, 2 % and 10 %. No reduction in the zinc concentration nor histological changes were observed in the 0. 02 % group. In the 2 % and 10 % groups, the zinc concentration in the <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> showed reduction of 68. 7 % and 73. 3 % as comparison with the non-treatment group. Histologically, no significant changes were noted in the different concentrations of the local injection, though only in the 10 % group not a few cases disclosed strong changes in the acinous epithelium, acinous cavity and stroma. 4) Local injections of 20 % Ca- 2 Na-EDTA were performed into the human hypertrophic <b>prostate</b> <b>glands.</b> They were divided into three groups, one-shot, three-shot and five-shot. In the one-shot and three-shot groups, there were no significant reduction in the zinc concentration and slight histological changes <b>prostate</b> <b>glands.</b> Even in the five-shot group, the reduction rate of the zinc concentration in the <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> showed only 9. 9 % being much less than expected.

5|$|Some {{features}} of the accessory glands in the male genital region vary among oryzomyines. In Transandinomys talamancae, {{a single pair of}} preputial glands is present at the penis. As is usual for sigmodontines, there are two pairs of ventral <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> and a single pair of anterior and dorsal <b>prostate</b> <b>glands.</b> Part {{of the end of the}} vesicular gland is irregularly folded, not smooth as in most oryzomyines.|$|R
5|$|In case {{of failure}} with PVS, {{spermatozoa}} are sometimes collected by electroejaculation: an electrical probe is {{inserted into the}} rectum, where it triggers ejaculation. The success rate is 80–100%, but the technique requires anaesthesia and {{does not have the}} potential to be done at home that PVS has. Both PVS and electroejaculation carry a risk of autonomic dysreflexia, so drugs to prevent the condition can be given in advance and blood pressure is monitored throughout the procedures for those who are susceptible. Massage of the <b>prostate</b> <b>gland</b> and seminal vesicles is another method to retrieve stored sperm. If these methods fail to cause ejaculation or do not yield sufficient usable sperm, sperm can be surgically removed by testicular sperm extraction or percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration. These procedures yield sperm in 86–100% of cases, but nonsurgical treatments are preferred.|$|E

25|$|During male seminal emission, sperm is {{transmitted}} from the vas deferens into the male urethra via the ejaculatory ducts, which lie within the <b>prostate</b> <b>gland.</b> Ejaculation is the expulsion of semen from the urethra.

40|$|Background: The {{management}} of {{benign prostatic hyperplasia}} (BPH) has changed considerably {{over the last several}} decades. First line treatment of BPH and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) with medical therapy has created a population of men with much larger <b>prostate</b> <b>glands,</b> many of whom require surgical intervention. Patients with <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> greater than 80 to 100 grams may be better managed surgically with a retropubic prostatectomy. We explore our experience with robotic assisted simple prostatectomy and review the relevant literature. Database: The database reviewed includes our experience with seven patients undergoing robotic simple prostatectomy, and a comprehensive review of the previously published series of this procedure. In addition, the literature pertaining to a pure laparoscopic approach to simple prostatectomy is reviewed. Conclusion: Robotic experience and training has become a standard in resident training programs; while classic transurethral resection is being performed less for large <b>prostate</b> <b>glands.</b> The robotic approach to simple prostatectomy provides an excellent option for surgical treatment of very large <b>prostate</b> <b>glands,</b> providing patients acceptable results in terms of operative time, estimated blood loss, hospital stay and duration of Foley catheter...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Transurethral {{resection}} of {{the prostate}} (TURP) is still considered the gold standard {{in the treatment of}} benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). However, open prostatectomy is indicated for <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> over 75 ml. There have been few reports concerning the use of TURP for large <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> over 100 ml. Herein we compared the effectiveness of monopolar TURP, bipolar TURP, and open prostatectomy in <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> larger than 100 ml. Materials and Methods: We reviewed the data of 48 patients with <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> larger than 100 ml. A total of 19, 17, and 12 patients underwent monopolar TURP (group A), bipolar TURP (group B), or open prostatectomy (group C), respectively. Preoperative International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), maximal flow rate (Qmax), prostate volume, resected tissue volume, resection velocity, and operative time were documented. Postoperative hemoglobin, serum sodium change, hospital stay, and postoperative 6 -month IPSS and Qmax were evaluated. Results: The prostate volumes did not differ significantly among the three groups. Operative time was similar in the two TURP groups, but open prostatectomy required a longer operative time. There {{was no significant difference in}} the resected prostate tissue or resection velocity between the two TURP groups. There was a marked decrease in postoperative serum sodium in the monopolar group compared with the other two groups. Among the groups, bipolar TURP required a shorter hospitalization. Postoperative IPSS, quality of life (QoL), and Qmax improved significantly in all groups. Conclusions: Even for large <b>prostate</b> <b>glands,</b> the results of this study suggest that bipolar TURP is an effective and safe operation owing to the significant improvements in voiding symptoms, shorter hospitalization, and fewer complications such as transurethral resection syndrome...|$|R

25|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} {{associated}} with urinary dysfunction as the <b>prostate</b> <b>gland</b> surrounds the prostatic urethra. Changes within the gland, therefore, directly affect urinary function.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a study on the}} {{development}} of an active palpation sensor wearable on a doctor’s finger for detecting the prostatic cancer and hypertrophy.

The sensor is worn on a doctor’s tip of a finger and the vibro-machine is attached to the root of the finger. The sensor output is collected in case that the sensor part contact with the target by driving the vibro-machine. Fundamental characteristics and the verification for diagnosis of the conditions of <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> are investigated in the laboratory tests and in clinical test.

25|$|Serum DHT {{levels are}} about 10% {{of those of}} {{testosterone}}, but levels in the <b>prostate</b> <b>gland</b> are 5- to 10-fold {{higher than those of}} testosterone due to a more than 90% conversion of testosterone into DHT by locally expressed 5α-reductase.

25|$|The {{clinical}} diagnosis of BPH {{is based on}} a history of LUTS (lower urinary tract symptoms), a digital rectal exam, and exclusion of other causes of similar signs and symptoms.

25|$|DHT is {{synthesized}} irreversibly from testosterone by {{the enzyme}} 5α-reductase. This occurs in various tissues including the genitals (penis, scrotum, clitoris, labia majora), <b>prostate</b> <b>gland,</b> skin, hair follicles, liver, and brain. Around 5 to 7% of testosterone undergoes 5α-reduction into DHT, and approximately 200 to 300μg of DHT is synthesized {{in the body}} per day. Most DHT is produced in peripheral tissues like the skin and liver, whereas most circulating DHT originates specifically from the liver. The testes and <b>prostate</b> <b>gland</b> contribute relatively little to concentrations of DHT in circulation.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The extradomain B of {{fibronectin}} (ED-B) is {{a promising}} vascular target for selective pharmacodelivery in cancer patients. We analyzed a large series of prostatectomies from patients with prostate cancer, hyperplastic prostate disease, and normal prostates to study extent and tumor-selectivity of ED-B expression. Methods: Using immunohistology, 68 adenocarcinomas {{of the prostate}} or prostate cancer-inflicted lymph nodes, 4 samples of benign prostatic hyperplasia, and 6 normal <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> were studied for ED-B expressing newly formed blood vessels. Further, we treated an advanced prostate cancer patient with the anti-ED-B antibody 131 I-L 19 SIP to study in vivo target accessibility. Results: ED-B-positive blood vessels were found significantly more frequent in prostate cancers as compared with peritumoral prostate tissues or normal <b>prostate</b> <b>glands,</b> independent of tumor differentiation. The ED-B-positive blood vessels' density was 97 (± 23), 65 (± 9), and 59 (± 9) /mm 2 in G 3, G 2, and G 1 prostate cancers, respectively, and 7 (± 5) /mm 2 in normal <b>prostate</b> <b>glands.</b> In high-grade (G 3) prostate cancers, also the peritumoral tissue showed a higher density of ED-B vessels than normal <b>prostate</b> <b>glands.</b> Similar results were obtained when ED-B-positive vessel density was expressed as a fraction of CD 34 -positive vessel density. Finally, selective uptake of ED-B-binding 131 I-L 19 SIP to tumor lesions was found in an advanced prostate cancer patient by whole-body planar scintigraphy. Conclusions: ED-B-positive blood vessels were found {{to a large extent}} in prostate cancer tissues, but only rarely in normal prostates or benign prostatic hyperplasia. Whole-body planar scintigraphy in a prostate cancer patient confirmed selective uptake of 131 I-L 19 SIP in the prostate cancer tissues, qualifying ED-B as a promising target for selective pharmacodelivery of anticancer agents in prostate cancer. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} sonoelastography for prostate cancer detection. Ultrasound (US) B-mode and sonoelastographic volumes were acquired from five <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> ex vivo. Additionally, one more gland was imaged in vivo using a transrectal US probe. Semi-automatic algorithms were used to segment {{the surface of the}} gland from the B-mode volume and the tumors from sonoelastographic data. To assess the detection performance, three dimensional (3 D) sonoelastographic findings were compared in size and position to 3 D histological data. Sonoelastography detected seven out of nine cancers in the ex vivo <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> and two out of three malignant masses in the in vivo experiment. Overall, 3 D sonoelastography has shown potential for prostate cancer detection albeit based on limited data.

40|$|Objective: Prostate {{cancer is}} the second most common cause of male cancer deaths after lung cancer in {{developed}} countries. The prognostic factors currently identified for prostate carcinoma include preoperative serum PSA, TNM staging system, histological grade and surgical margin status and are composed of the clinically most important and useful parameters. However, all the markers studied have not been applied in clinical practice. The oncofetal protein Insulin-Like Growth Factor II has been demonstrated to be associated with aggressive tumor behavior in many organs including urothelial tumors and renal cell carcinoma. Our aim was to investigate the expression status of Insulin-Like Growth Factor II in benign <b>prostate</b> <b>glands,</b> high grade PIN and prostate adenocarcinoma, and to determine the role of Insulin-Like Growth Factor II in pathogenesis of prostate adenocarcinoma. Material and Method: A total of 70 prostate adenocarcinoma cases accompanied by high grade PIN and benign <b>prostate</b> <b>glands</b> were evaluated by immunohistochemistry for the expression of Insulin-Like Growth Factor II. Results: Insulin-Like Growth Factor II expression was not seen in any of the 70 prostate adenocarcinoma and high grade PIN cases and benign <b>prostate</b> <b>glands.</b> Conclusion: Although the number of our cases was limited, our results suggested that Insulin-Like Growth Factor II protein expression {{was not included in the}} pathogenesis of the prostate adenocarcinomas and Insulin-Like Growth Factor II expression status cannot be used for diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinomas...|$|R
