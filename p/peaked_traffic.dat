50|$|For many years, Buffalo was the nation's {{second largest}} rail center, after Chicago. <b>Peaked</b> <b>traffic</b> reached during World War II, but {{declined}} {{soon after the}} war. Through the 1960s and 1970s freight traffic via Buffalo declined, air travel and the New York State Thruway took railway passengers away as well. By 1980, the rail hub in the city was gone.|$|E
50|$|Handling highly <b>peaked</b> <b>traffic,</b> {{much of it}} railway or dock {{employees}} travelling either free or at reduced fares, {{was never}} lucrative despite high passenger numbers (1.35 million in 1948 and over a million as late as 1956), {{but as long as}} docks and railway were under common ownership and management this was a lesser consideration. Although partly re-laid in 1950 the in-town street section was closed from 1 July 1956 when Grimsby Corporation exercised their right to buy the line in order to abandon it, and the trams then terminated at the edge of Grimsby with a connecting bus service. Closure of the remainder was first proposed in 1958, and a bus service commenced on 28 February 1959, worked jointly over an indirect route by Grimsby Corporation and the Lincolnshire Road Car Company. A tram service was only retained in much curtailed form in peak periods, pending completion of a direct road to the industrial estate and the docks. Although the road had still not been built the tramway was again proposed for closure in 1960, and the service was finally withdrawn on 1 July 1961. Even at closure it was still handling around 250,000 passengers a year.|$|E

50|$|Passenger <b>traffic</b> <b>peaked</b> in 1913, {{but later}} {{declined}} {{to such an}} extent that the passenger service was withdrawn in 1951. Freight traffic continued to use the line until the Beeching cuts of 1964.|$|R

50|$|Airline <b>traffic</b> <b>peaked</b> in 1990 at 226,813 passengers, {{but by the}} end of {{the decade}} the small size of the market, {{proximity}} to Syracuse Hancock International Airport and other regional airports, and crowded airspace led Trans World Airlines, United Airlines, and finally Continental Airlines to leave.|$|R

50|$|Mineral traffic {{increased}} considerably, and the quayside at Looe became seriously congested. However, copper ore <b>traffic</b> <b>peaked</b> at 27,000 tons in 1863, declining afterwards. Inwards coal {{continued to}} climb, however, as the mines were exploiting deeper lodes, requiring more engine power for winding and to drain them. Granite held steady at 7,000 tons for several years, and limestone (inwards) held at about 4,000 tons.|$|R

50|$|<b>Traffic</b> <b>peaked</b> at 100 {{intercity}} {{passenger trains}} {{per day in}} the early 1890s, not including suburban (what would now be called commuter) trains. The Illinois Central constructed a new facility, Central Station, to meet the traffic demands of the World's Columbian Exposition. That station opened on April 17, 1893, and Great Central was demolished. Suburban trains continued to stop north of Central Station where Millennium Station now stands.|$|R
25|$|The hub's <b>traffic</b> <b>peaked</b> in 1991.

American began to consider closing the hub in late 1993; operations were reduced until June 1995 when American closed the hub, retaining flights to three AA hubs and London.|$|R

2500|$|By 1957 {{there were}} 1,300 Norwegian ships with HF {{transmitters}} and Bergen Radio handled {{half a million}} telegrams per year. There were 5,000 telephone calls transmitted via the coast radio stations. The demand exceeded the capacity, so the Telegraphy Administration decided {{to build a new}} main HF telegraphy station. Rogaland Radio was located in Sandnes, south of Stavanger, with the receiver and offices located at Høyland and the sender located at Nærbø, [...] away. The facilities cost NOK6 million and also took over Stavanger Radio's MF services. Up to nineteen operators were on duty at any given time. Its <b>traffic</b> <b>peaked</b> at half a million annual telegrams during the first decade, but the experienced a significant drop. An important reason was the 1971 introduction of the radio telex, which could be handled automatically instead of by an operator. An important driver of the telex traffic was the petroleum industry in the North Sea. Telex <b>traffic</b> <b>peaked</b> at 550,000 sent minutes in the late 1970s. Radio telegraphy and radio telex was from then gradually replaced with Inmarsat, a communications satellite system, with Eik Earth Station in Rogaland being Europe's first ground station for Inmarsat.|$|R

50|$|Iron ore <b>traffic</b> <b>peaked</b> in 1880 {{at about}} 100,000 ST annually, then fell {{off as the}} Mesabi Range mines came into production.
