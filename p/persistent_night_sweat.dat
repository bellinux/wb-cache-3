40|$|Introduction. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) {{is a rare}} hyperinflammatory {{syndrome}} {{that can}} be associated with inherited genetic mutations, malignancy, autoimmune disorders, and viral infections. Though the pathogenesis is not fully known, HLH is understood to be a reactive process in the setting of uncontrolled activation of macrophages, CD 8 + cytotoxic lymphocytes, and other immune cells. Hallmark clinicopathological features of HLH include fevers, cytopenias, hepatosplenomegaly, and hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow. Case Presentation. A previously healthy 28 -year-old Caucasian male presented with a one-month history of <b>persistent</b> fever, <b>night</b> <b>sweats,</b> and unintentional weight loss. He was diagnosed with classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) by core-needle biopsy of an axillary lymph node. Both bone marrow involvement by HL and hemophagocytosis were seen on subsequent bone marrow biopsy. Other findings included pancytopenia, splenomegaly, and elevated serum ferritin. Extensive work-up for autoimmune and infectious etiologies was unremarkable. The patient had a complete response after chemotherapy with Adriamycin, bleomycin, vincristine, and dacarbazine. Conclusion. This report documents the exceedingly uncommon association between HLH and HL. HLH is a hyperinflammatory syndrome with high mortality, so it is imperative to identify and treat the underlying cause for secondary HLH. Malignancy-associated HLH should be considered in the differential diagnosis for cancer patients who present with fever, cytopenias, and splenomegaly...|$|R
40|$|Background: When asked, a {{significant}} number of patients report having experienced <b>night</b> <b>sweats.</b> Those who do are more likely to report decreased physical health, mental health, and quality of life. In most cases the cause of <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> is unknown. We therefore do not know how much to worry about patients with this symptom. The present study examined associations between <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> and mortal-ity. Methods: We used logistic regression and proportional hazards analyses to investigate potential pre-dictors of mortality, including <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> reported at baseline, among 2 different cohorts of people older than 65 years of age (n 682 and n 852) who were followed for an average of 7. 3 and 7. 5 years, respectively. Results: Patients who reported <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> were not more likely to die or to die sooner {{than those who did not}} report <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> after controlling for age, sex, body mass index, education, and income. This held true as well for patients who reported more severe <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> among the cohort in which the severity of <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> was quantified. Conclusions: Patients who report <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> on a primary care health history questionnaire do not seem, on average, to be at increased risk for mortality.

40|$|Primary Objective : The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} determinants of hot flashes and <b>night</b> <b>sweats,</b> two vasomotor symptoms associated with the hormonal changes of the menopause transition. Methods: Participants were 293 women, aged 45 to 55, randomly selected from automated demographic and membership records of a health maintenance organization in the northeast USA. Letters were mailed to eligible women, followed by face-to-face interviews. Results : Hot flashes during the month before interview were reported by 57 % of the participants, although only 9 % of the entire sample reported hot flashes to be “bothersome”. <b>Night</b> <b>sweats</b> were reported by 36 % of all participants, with 6 % reporting <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> to be “bothersome”. Fifty-four percent of women reporting hot flashes also reported <b>night</b> <b>sweats.</b> In logistic regression analyses that controlled for menopause status and use of hormone therapy (HT), daily alcohol consumption significantly increased the risk of hot flashes, <b>night</b> <b>sweats,</b> and bothersome <b>night</b> <b>sweats.</b> Higher education and an excellent self-rating of health decreased the risk of <b>night</b> <b>sweats,</b> but not hot flashes. Smoking increased the risk of bothersome hot flashes, but not bothersome <b>night</b> <b>sweats.</b> Conclusions : In logistic regression analyses, alcohol consumption was a significant predictor of vasomotor symptoms.

40|$|Background: In 2 {{previous}} studies, patients reporting <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> {{were found}} to be more likely to have other sleep-related symptoms. Sleep apnea is often mentioned as a possible cause of <b>night</b> <b>sweats,</b> but there is little evidence to support this assertion. Methods: Retrospective review of data from 2 sleep laboratories in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Analy-ses included bivariate and multivariate tests of associations between reported <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> and other sleep-related symptoms, scores on specific sleep inventories, and findings from polysomnography. Results: Patients who reported <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> {{were more likely to report}} daytime fatigue (P. 001); creepy/crawly feelings in their legs (P. 003); kicking during sleep (P. 004); snoring (P. 03); nighttime breathing trouble (P <. 0001); awakening in the night with aches and pains (P <. 0001); and waking in the morning with a headache (P. 0002) and still tired (P. 002) as compared with those who did not report <b>night</b> <b>sweats.</b> They also had higher mean scores on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (P <. 0001). However, there was no statistically significant association between reported <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> and sleep onset latency, arousal index, apnea hypopnea index, periodic leg movement index, or total sleep time.

40|$|Objective This study applies a biocultural {{perspective}} {{to better understand}} the determinants of hot flashes and <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> within immigrant and local populations in Madrid, Spain. Methods A combined sample of 575 women from Madrid, aged 45 to 55, was drawn from two studies. The Spanish sample (n= 274) participated in the Decisions at Menopause Study (DAMES) in 2000 – 2002. The Latin-American sample (n= 301) was drawn from immigrants to Madrid in 2010 – 2011. Chi square analyses and logistic regression models were carried out among the combined controlling by origin of provenance. Results Forty four percent of the women reported hot flashes, 36 % reported <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> and 26 % both symptoms. Compared to Spanish women, Latin-American women were less likely to report hot flashes (OR 0. 7, 95 % CI 0. 4 – 0. 9) after controlling for demographic variables and menopausal status. The same was not found for <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> and for both symptoms combined. Determinants of hot flashes differed from determinants of <b>night</b> <b>sweats.</b> Conclusions Because determinants differed, hot flashes and <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> should be queried and analyzed separately.

40|$|Abstract Background This trial aims to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of a group cognitive behavioural intervention to alleviate menopausal symptoms (hot flushes and <b>night</b> <b>sweats)</b> in women who have had breast cancer treatment. Hot flushes and <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> are highly prevalent but challenging to treat in this population. Cognitive behaviour therapy has been found to reduce these symptoms in well women and results of an exploratory trial suggest that it might be effective for breast cancer patients. Two hypotheses are tested: Compared to usual care, group cognitive behavioural therapy will: 1. Significantly reduce the problem rating and frequency of hot flushes and <b>nights</b> <b>sweats</b> after six weeks of treatment and at six months post-randomisation. 2. Improve mood and quality of life after six weeks of treatment and at six months post-randomisation. Methods/Design Ninety-six women who have completed their main treatment for breast cancer and who have been experiencing problematic hot flushes and <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> for over two months are recruited into the trial from oncology and breast clinics in South East London. They are randomised to either six weekly group cognitive behavioural therapy (Group CBT) sessions or to usual care. Group CBT includes information and discussion about hot flushes and <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> in the context of breast cancer, monitoring and modifying precipitants, relaxation and paced respiration, stress management, cognitive therapy for unhelpful thoughts and beliefs, managing sleep and <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> and maintaining changes. Prior to randomisation women attend a clinical interview, undergo 24 -hour sternal skin conductance monitoring, and complete questionnaire measures of hot flushes and <b>night</b> <b>sweats,</b> mood, quality of life, hot flush beliefs and behaviours, optimism and somatic amplification. Post-treatment measures (sternal skin conductance and questionnaires) are collected six to eight weeks later and follow-up measures (questionnaires and a use of medical services measure) at six months post-randomisation. Discussion MENOS 1 is the first randomised controlled trial of cognitive behavioural therapy for hot flushes and <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> that measures both self-reported and physiologically indexed symptoms. The results will inform future clinical practice by developing an evidence-based, non-medical treatment, which can be delivered by trained health professionals.

40|$|Hot {{flashes and}} <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> {{associated}} with menopause {{are the most}} annoying symptoms among premenopausal women and have been ranked as the first reason for referral to medical centers. The common treatment for this symptom is administration of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) that has some adverse effects and is sometimes contraindicated. Therefore, use of herbal drugs that have fewer side effects needs to be investigated. This study aimed to investigate the influence of salvia tablets on hot flashes, <b>night</b> <b>sweats,</b> and estradiol hormone in postmenopausal women referring to healthcare centers in Shiraz. This double-blind randomized clinical trial was performed on 100 qualified postmenopausal women with hot flashes. The study women {{were divided into two}} groups daily treated with 3 salvia or placebo tablets (100 mg) for 8 weeks. Estradiol hormone and menopause symptoms were evaluated using Menopause Rating Scale(MRS) 1 week before and 8 weeks after the beginning the intervention. Besides, duration, intensity, and frequency of hot flashes and <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> were evaluated every week, and the two groups were compared in terms of these variables. The results showed {{no significant difference between the}} two groups regarding demographic information, hot flashes, <b>night</b> <b>sweats,</b> and other menopause symptoms in MRS scale before the intervention. After 8 weeks, however, hot flashes, <b>night</b> <b>sweats,</b> and MRS scores significantly decreased in the saliva group compared to the control group. However, no significant difference was observed between the two groups concerning the estradiol levels. Yet, the results of intra-group analysis showed that the level of this hormone increased in the sage group. Sage tablets were effective in treatment of hot flashes, <b>night</b> <b>sweats,</b> and other menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. Thus, they can be considered as an alternative therapy for the individuals who are not able to use HRT. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Visceral pentastomiasis {{in humans}} {{is caused by}} the larval stages (nymphs) of the arthropod-related tongue worms Linguatula serrata, Armillifer armillatus, A. moniliformis, A. grandis, and Porocephalus crotali. The {{majority}} of cases has been reported from Africa, Malaysia, and the Middle East, where visceral pentastomiasis may be an incidental finding in autopsies, and less often from China and Latin America. In Europe and North America, the disease is only rarely encountered in immigrants and long-term travelers, and the parasitic lesions may be confused with malignancies, leading to a delay in the correct diagnosis. Since clinical symptoms are variable and serological tests are not readily available, the diagnosis often relies on histopathological examinations. This laboratory symposium focuses on the diagnosis of this unusual parasitic disease and presents its risk factors and epidemiology. The Problem In a recently published case [1], an immigrant from Kazakhstan was admitted to a hospital in Germany with <b>persistent</b> cough and <b>night</b> <b>sweats.</b> The patient had a normal white blood cell count (7, 140 cells/ml) with mild eosinophilia (7 %, 500 cells/ml). Serology for tissue-invasive helminths, e. g., Ascaris, Toxocara, Strongyloides, Trichinella, Fasciola, Paragonimus, Schistosoma, and Echinococcus spp. was negative, as were repeated stool and sputum examinations. A chest X ray revealed multiple lesions in both lungs, and pulmonary malignancy was suspected. The patient eventually underwent thoracotomy, and multiple nodules were excised that revealed exceptional parasitic structures (Figure 1 A). Because of its peculiarity, the examination of the parasite responsible was lengthy, but finally a diagnosis of visceral (pulmonary) pentasto-miasis due to the nymphs of L. serrata was made. Written consent of the patient was obtained for the publication of his clinical data and history...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: There {{is limited}} {{research}} on hot flushes and <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> {{in women with}} a hysterectomy with ovarian conservation. We aimed to describe the patterns of these symptoms in a cohort of Australian women and to investigate the relationship between distinct symptom patterns and hysterectomy status. Study design and outcome measures: Repeated-measures latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify hot flushes and <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> symptom patterns across seven surveys (over 17 years) in the mid-cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. Multinomial logistic regression {{was used to assess}} the associations of the symptom patterns in women with a hysterectomy with ovarian conservation (n = 1129) versus women without a hysterectomy (n = 4977). Results: A higher proportion of women with a hysterectomy than of those without experienced a constant pattern of hot flushes (15 % versus 30 %) and <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> (9 % versus 19 %). Women with a hysterectomy had higher odds of constant hot flushes versus minimal hot flushes (OR = 1. 97, 95 % CI: 1. 64, 2. 35) and constant versus minimal <b>night</b> <b>sweats</b> (OR = 2. 09, 95 % CI: 1. 70, 2. 55). Smoking, a 'lower level of education to non-professional occupation' pathway and body mass index (BMI) patterns of 'always obese' and 'increasingly obese' were also associated with a higher risk of constant symptoms.
