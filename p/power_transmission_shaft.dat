Wear produces loss of sucrose extraction and loss of grip of the roll on the bagasse.  This paper presents the evaluation of wear and loss of grip of hypoeutectic and hypereutectic high chromium welding deposits applied on ASTM A- 36 steel and gray cast iron. A modified ASTM G- 65 standard test was used.  Wear was produced by the abrasive action of wet bagasse with three levels of mineral extraneous matter. Silica grains with sizes {{in the range of}} 0. 212 - 0. 300 mm (AFS 50 / 70) were used as mineral extraneous matter.

40|$|Evaluation of <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>shafting</b> for {{high-speed}} balancing {{has shown}} that when axial torque is applied, the imbalance response is altered. An increase in synchronous excitation always occurs if the axial torque level is altered from the value used during balancing; {{this was the case}} even when the shaft was balanced with torque applied. The twisting of the long slender shaft produces a change in the imbalance distribution sufficient to disrupt the balanced state. This paper presents a review of the analytic development of a weighted least squares approach to influence coefficient balancing and a review of experimental results.

40|$|AbstractComponents {{subjected}} to flexural and torsional loadings, such as <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>shafts,</b> are elements that sometimes fail due to fatigue crack propagation. Other example of mechanical element that occasionally fail {{and that can}} be simultaneously submitted to bending and torsion are endodontic files, which are being widespread used in mechanized endodontic treatments. With the intent of analyzing the influence of bending and torsion on the Stress Intensity Factors (SIF), KI,II,III, at different crack geometries (a/r), two CAD 3 D models were created, namely one cylindrical shaft and one endodontic file. The evaluation of KI, KII and KIII for the two components under study was carried out at several points along the crack front using the Finite Element Method (FEM) together with Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) concepts. The Finite Element Analyses (FEA) carried out shown that flexural loads have a preponderant impact on KI values, although torsion may have influence on it depending on the order of magnitude of the torsional loading values applied on the component. However, when pure torsion loading was considered, KII and KIII values become dominant at crack tip. Finally, numerical results obtained revealed that geometric complexity and reduced dimensions of components can play an important role when analyzing SIF, being this particularly relevant on the case of endodontic file...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} “Failure Analysis of Internal splines in Torsion Shaft” of “TPE 331 - 5 - 252 D - GARRET ENGINE” {{which is used}} in Dornier aircraft. Garret Engine {{is a type of}} air {{breathing}} engine. It comes under the category of Turboprop engines of Gas turbine engine. As separate shafts are used for propeller and turbine, this aids them to rotate at different RPM. A torsion shaft is used to transmit the torque from main shaft to propeller shaft. Torsion shaft is used to give a deflection which is also used to measure the torque of the engine. This torsion shaft is internally connected with the main <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>shaft</b> and its other end is coupled to a coupler shaft with engagement of its internal splines to the external splines of coupler shaft. Further this coupler connects to the gearing system and transmits power to the propeller shaft. Due to Continues variable load over internal splines, it is subjected to high rate of wear and tear. This problem can be rectified by Failure Mode Analysis Method, in which heat treatment process of torsion shaft is being carried out. Two test pieces are heat treated separately at different temperatures of 5800 C and 5400 C at variable time durations. Tuffriding which is a Liquid nitriding process is done with this two test pieces and results are analyzed.

The walls of the box body are 40 -mm-thick steel plate welded into a tight complete structure, with a cover plate thickness of 60  mm, and the design pressure is 6  MPa. The primary box’s length, width and height are 1600, 1200 and 1200  mm, respectively. The maximum experimental coal sample mass is about 1200  kg. The front and rear surfaces of the main box body contain 24 holes with different height distributions in three layers; 23 of these have a 14  mm diameter for conveying sensor cables and the remaining holes with 12  mm diameters are standard screw drills for gas injection. A special high-pressure hose {{is connected to the}} external side, and the hole’s internal side is connected with a cribriform ventilation device {{at the bottom of the}} primary box (Fig.  2 b).

Thus they have been used in a variety of applications such as generator sets, small auxiliary power units (APu), air conditioning of aircraft cabins and hybrid electric vehicles turbines. The current research describes the design, manufacturing, construction and testing a radial type small gas turbine. The aim was to design and build the engine to drive directly a high-speed permanent magnet alternator running at 60000 rpmand developing a maximum of 60 W. This direct coupling arrangement produces a portable, light, compact, reliable and environment friendly power generator. These features make the generator set very attractive to use in many applications including emergency power generation for hospitals, in areas of natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes, in remote areas that cannot be served from the national grid, oil rigs, and in confined places of limited spaces. It {{is important to recognize that}} the design of the main components, that is, the inward flow radial UFR turbines, the centrifugal compressor and the combustion chamber involve consideration of aero-dynamics, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, stress analysis, vibration analysis, selection of bearings, selection of suitable materials and the requirements for manufacturing. These considerations are all inter-linked and a procedure has been followed to reach an optimum design. This research was divided into three phases: phase I dealt with the complete design of the inward radial turbine, the centrifugal compressor, the <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>shaft,</b> the selection of combustion chamber and the bearing housing including the selection of bearings. Phase 2 dealt with mechanical consideration of the rotating components that is stress, thermal and vibration analyses of the turbine rotor, the impeller and the rotating shaft, respectively. Also it dealt with the selection of a suitable fuel and oil lubrication systems and a suitable starting system. Phase 3 dealt with the manufacturing of the gas turbine components, balancing the rotating components, assembling the engine and finally commissioning and then testing the engine. The current work in this thesis has put the light on a new design methodology on determining the optimum principal dimensions of the rotor and the impeller. This method, also, has defined the optimum number of blades and the axial length of the rotor and the impeller.
