25|$|The {{foundation}} of any construction project {{is rooted in}} the concept and design stages. The concept stage, in fact, {{is one of the major}} steps in a <b>project</b> <b>life</b> <b>cycle,</b> as it has the largest impact on cost and performance. In designing environmentally optimal buildings, the objective is to minimize the total environmental impact associated with all life-cycle stages of the building project. However, building as a process is not as streamlined as an industrial process, and varies from one building to the other, never repeating itself identically. In addition, buildings are much more complex products, composed of a multitude of materials and components each constituting various design variables to be decided at the design stage. A variation of every design variable may affect the environment during all the building's relevant life-cycle stages.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{whether all}} {{expected}} costs over the <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> of metallurgical research projects {{are included in}} initial, normal and final cost estimates, and whether these costs are managed throughout a <b>project’s</b> <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> since {{there is not enough}} emphasis on the accurate estimation of costs and their management over the <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> of metallurgical research projects. The study also determines during which phase of the <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> of metallurgical research projects’ costs are normally determined, during which phase most of the costs are incurred, and during which phase costs are managed. <b>Project</b> <b>life</b> <b>cycles,</b> techniques of cost estimation and cost management are examined. A survey was used to gather information by means of face-to-face and telephonic interviews, as well as an electronic questionnaire. The total population of entities in South Africa that conduct metallurgical research projects is small, numbering only 12 in all. The ten entities that conducted the largest metallurgical research projects in terms of average size were selected for this study. The conclusion drawn from the survey was that all costs over the <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> of metallurgical research projects are not taken into account in the initial cost estimate of a project. Costs are mainly managed during the growth phase of a project and not during the introduction phase, when 80 % of the costs are normally committed. The implication of this is that cost estimates for metallurgical research projects may not be accurate and costs are not necessarily managed properly throughout the <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> of such <b>projects.</b> This may lead to cost overruns of project budgets, project budgets being depleted before the delivery stage and research sections running at a loss.
