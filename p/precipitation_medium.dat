Precipitation from Homogeneous Solution: In {{order to}} make Q minimum we can, in some situations, {{generate}} the precipitating agent in the <b>precipitation</b> <b>medium</b> rather than adding it. For example, in order to precipitate iron as the hydroxide, we dissolve urea in the sample. Heating of the solution generates hydroxide ions from the hydrolysis of urea. Hydroxide ions are generated at all points in solution and thus there are no sites of concentration. We can also adjust the rate of urea hydrolysis and thus control the hydroxide generation rate. This type of procedure can be very advantageous in case of colloidal precipitates.|$|E
40|$|Although the {{implications}} of calcium carbonate (CaCO(3)) precipitation by microorganisms in natural environments are quite relevant, the physiology and genetics of this phenomenon are poorly understood. We have chosen Bacillus subtilis 168 as our model to study which physiological aspects are associated with CaCO(3) (calcite) formation during biofilm development when grown on <b>precipitation</b> <b>medium.</b> A B. subtilis eftA mutant named FBC 5 impaired in calcite precipitation was used for comparative studies. Our results demonstrate that inactivation of etfA causes {{a decrease in the}} pH of the <b>precipitation</b> <b>medium</b> during biofilm development. Further analysis demonstrated that eftA extrudes an excess of 0. 7 mol H(+) L(- 1) with respect to B. subtilis 168 strain. Using media buffered at different pH values, we were able to control calcite formation. Because etfA encodes the alpha-subunit of a putative flavoprotein involved in fatty acid metabolism, we compared the intracellular levels of NADH among strains. Our physiological assay showed that FBC 5 accumulated up to 32 times more NADH than the wild-type strain. We propose that the accumulation of NADH causes a deregulation in the generation of the proton motive force (DeltamicroH(+)) in FBC 5 producing the acidification...|$|E

Alginate was preferred because of its constructive properties and it was prepared in a cylindrical shape to facilitate the insertion of the carrier for in vivo studies. The alginate carriers were prepared as calcium alginate gel as well as cross-linking agents. In {{the preparation of the}} alginate carriers, <b>precipitation</b> <b>medium</b> concentration, cross-linker concentration, and Mitomycin-C/alginate ratio were changed to obtain drug attachment to the inner wall of bladder and/or optimum release rate of the agent. Due to the hydrogel structure of the alginate, the swelling behavior of the polymer was evaluated by gravimetric determinations in aqueous media periodically. Swelling ratios of the alginate carriers were changed from 30 to 65 % based on <b>precipitation</b> <b>medium,</b> cross-linker concentration, and swelling medium pH. For prediction of the bioadhesion of the alginate carriers to the inner surface of bladder, in vitro bioadhesion tests were performed by using fresh bladders which were taken from New Zealand rabbits.

It was attempted to relate the influence of liquid–liquid demixing and solid–liquid demixing on the membrane morphologies to the ternary phase diagram. Two different morphologies and two different demixing rates could be obtained by using water and 2 -propanol, respectively, to precipitate the cosolvent system. When water was used as the <b>precipitation</b> <b>medium,</b> it showed a rapidly precipitating system and cellular morphologies were obtained due to liquid–liquid demixing. In contrast, when 2 -propanol was used as the <b>precipitation</b> <b>medium,</b> it showed delayed demixing and crystallization-induced particulate morphologies were formed.

It has been found that the sheet forms of calcium hydroxide can be stabilised by reaction with a silylating agent, resulting in greater thermal stability and chemical stability of the surface. Silylation was found not to occur by direct contact between the precipitated calcium hydroxide samples and silylating agents. Silylation only occurred when precipitation was carried out in the presence of a solution of the silylating agent in absolute ethanol. The silylation of the surface of calcium hydroxide has been found to stabilise the material. Reaction of this with 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane formed an intermediate which subsequently reacted with p-nitrobenzoyl chloride to form an inorganic - organic composite. The technique of thermogravimetric analysis has been employed to measure the thermal stability of the samples. It has been found that the samples exhibit major weight losses at around 688 K for the non-silylated samples and around 918 K for the silylated samples. The BETnitrogen and the BET-H 20 surface areas of the samples range typically from [...] 1 to 43 m 2 g- 1, and from 9 to 798 m 2 g- 1 respectively. On the basis of this evidence, taken together with the isotherm shapes it has been shown that: the samples are non-porous; non-silylated calcium hydroxide samples are more hydrophobic than the silylated samples, but upon heat-treatment in air below the decomposition temperature the silylated samples became more hydrophobic, whereas the non-silylated samples became more hydrophilic; samples heated in air at above the decomposition temperature exhibit a dramatic increase in hydrophilicity, the H 20 -BET surface areas becoming — 800 m 2 g- 1 for non silylated samples, compared to 368 - 600 m 2 g- 1 for silylated samples, indicative of chemisorption following decomposition of the calcium hydroxide to form calcium oxide...|$|E

40|$|A {{precipitation}} retrieval {{algorithm is}} proposed for the dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR) on the core satellite of the Global Precipitation Measurement mission. The proposed algorithm is called the HB-DFR algorithm, {{in reference to the}} combination of Histchfeld-Bordan's attenuation correction method (HB method) and the dual-frequency ratio (DFR) method. The HB-DFR algorithm is tested with a synthetic DPR dataset produced from the standard product of the PR on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission. Precipitation rates estimated by the HB-DFR algorithm at the lowest (near-surface) range bin are evaluated by comparing them with the corresponding values calculated from the drop size distribution of the synthetic dataset. For 'light precipitation' (below 1 mm h- 1), precipitation rates are slightly underestimated because of the multiple-solution problem in the DFR method. For 'heavy precipitation' (above 10 mm h- 1), the precipitation rates are severely underestimated, and the biases become large when thick liquid phase precipitation occurs. For 'medium precipitation' (between 1 and 10 mm h - 1), the estimates are satisfactory. As almost 50 % of <b>precipitation</b> falls as <b>medium</b> <b>precipitation</b> in the synthetic dataset, this result validates the usefulness of DPR measurements and the HB-DFR algorithm. Because the HB-DFR algorithm is a forward retrieval algorithm, it has multiple solutions and produces larger errors when applied to lower (farther) range bins.

Here, the synthesis of a Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 −x(VO 4) x(OH) 2 stoichiometric solid solution using a co-precipitation method is monitored in the whole composition range (0 ≤ x ≤ 6) by controlling the pH of the <b>precipitation</b> <b>medium,</b> with continuous (the first series of samples) or periodic (the second series of samples) addition of NH 4 OH during the precipitation step or during the maturation step, respectively. It is demonstrated that the changes in pH conditions result in materials of a substantial difference in terms of the final composition. From XRD patterns and Rietveld refinements, a solid solution V-HAp phase was found to be exclusively obtained for the first series of samples for x varying from 0 to 6. This also occurred in the second series of samples but only for x lower than 4. For 4 ≤ x ≤ 5. 22, the materials were composed of a mixture of V-HAp and Ca 2 V 2 O 7, whereas for a x value of 6 only Ca 2 V 2 O 7 was formed. The predominance of polymeric V species in solution at a high vanadium concentration deduced from the diagram of speciation of vanadium accounts for the preferential formation of Ca 2 V 2 O 7 under these particular conditions. However, provided that a higher pH value was maintained, isolated VO 3 (OH) 2 − species are predominant, which accounts for the incorporation of isolated vanadates into the hydroxyapatite framework and for the well-controlled stoichiometry with Ca/(P + V) ratios found to be close to 1. 67.

To maintain the water quality of the aquatic environment {{and the provision of}} food from highly efficient agriculture in line with the EU's Water Framework Directive and Nitrates Directive, field-scale knowledge is essential for introducing water management actions on-field or off-field and producing an optimal differentiated N-regulation in future.

The fields differ in their inherent hydrogeological field settings (e. g. soil-type, geology, climate, drainage and groundwater table) and the agricultural management of the fields (e. g. crop type, type of N fertilisers and agricultural practices). The evaluation revealed three types of clayey till fields characterised by: (i) low net precipitation, high concentration of nitrate-N, and short-term low intensity drainage at air temperatures often below 5 °C; (ii) medium net <b>precipitation,</b> <b>medium</b> concentration of nitrate-N, and short-term medium-intensity drainage at air temperatures often above 5 °C; and (iii) high net precipitation, low concentration of nitrate-N and long-term high intensity drainage at air temperatures above 5 °C. For each type, on-field water management actions, such as the selection of crop types and introduction of catch crops, appeared relevant, whereas off-field actions only seemed relevant for the latter two field types given the temperature-dependent reduction potential of nitrate off-field. This initial well-documented field-scale knowledge from fields that are representative of large areas in Denmark is a first step towards establishing a differentiated N-regulation for clayey till areas. Additionally, it provides a unique starting point by identifying important parameters for future mapping of catchment-scale variations in nitrate concentrations and fluxes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Induced {{precipitation}} of phosphate minerals {{to scavenge}} trace elements from groundwater {{is a potential}} remediation approach for contaminated aquifers. The success of engineered precipitation schemes depends on the particular phases generated, their rates of formation, and their long term stability. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the precipitation of calcium phosphate minerals under conditions representative of a natural groundwater. Because microorganisms are present in groundwater, and because some proposed schemes for phosphate mineral precipitation rely on stimulation of native microbial populations, we also tested the effect of bacterial cells (initial densities of 10 5 and 10 7 mL - 1) added to the <b>precipitation</b> <b>medium.</b> In addition, we tested the effect of a trace mixture of propionic, isovaleric, formic and butyric acids (total concentration 0. 035 mM). Results The general progression of mineral precipitation was similar under all of the study conditions, with initial formation of amorphous calcium phosphate, and transformation to poorly crystalline hydroxylapatite (HAP) within one week. The presence of the bacterial cells appeared to delay precipitation, although by the end of the experiments the overall extent of precipitation was similar for all treatments. The stoichiometry of the final precipitates as well as Rietveld structure refinement using x-ray diffraction data indicated that the presence of organic acids and bacterial cells resulted in an increasing a and decreasing c lattice parameter, with the higher concentration of cells resulting in the greatest distortion. Uptake of Sr into the solids was decreased in the treatments with cells and organic acids, compared to the control. Conclusions Our results suggest that the minerals formed initially during an engineered precipitation application for trace element sequestration may not be the ones that control long-term immobilization of the contaminants. In addition, the presence of bacterial cells appears to be associated with delayed HAP precipitation, changes in the lattice parameters, and reduced incorporation of trace elements as compared to cell-free systems. Schemes to remediate groundwater contaminated with trace metals that are based on enhanced phosphate mineral precipitation may need to account for these phenomena, particularly if the remediation approach relies on enhancement of in situ microbial populations. </p...|$|E
40|$|Diese Arbeit beschäftigte sich mit der Erforschung von Synthese-Methoden zur Darstellung von Metallsulfid-Nanopartikeln und der Entwicklung von Hochdurchsatz-Synthesemethoden für Metallsulfid-Nanopartikel. Zum einen wurde eine inverse Mikroemulsion mit nichtionischem Surfactant als Medium für die Fällung von Metallsulfid-Nanopartikeln verwendet. Zum anderen wurde eine Gasphasenabscheidungsanlage gebaut, mit dem Ziel schichtartige Übergangsmetallchalkogenide in nanokristalliner Form darzustellen. In der Gasphasenabscheidungsanlage wurden ausgehend von den Precursoren Mo(CO) 6 und H 2 S-Gas erfolgreich 2 H-MoS 2 -Nanopartikel mit einer mittleren Kristallitgröße von 4 nm dargestellt. Im Fall der Mikroemulsionssynthesen wurden unterschiedliche Sulfidanionen-Precursoren (TMTMS, CS 2, Lawessons Reagenz, H 2 S) hinsichtlich ihrer Eignung für die Fällung einer breiten Palette an Metallsulfiden untersucht. Mit H 2 S wurden u. a. nanokristalline und/oder amorphe Sulfide von Cd, Zn, Cu, Fe, Mo, Pt, Pd, Rh, Re, Ru, Ag und Au sowie (Cu,M) -Mischsulfide (M=Zn, Fe, Ni) gefällt. Für die kristallinen Materialien wurden mittlere Kristallitgrößen zwischen 3 - 19 nm ermittelt. In einem ersten Schritt hin zur Hochdurchsatz-Mikroemulsionssynthese von Metallsulfid-NP mit H 2 S-Gas wurde ein 9 -fach-Parallelreaktor mit integrierter Membranfiltrationseinheit entwickelt. Der Parallelreaktor wurde für die Synthese von CdS, Ag 2 S und (Ag,Cu) -Mischsulfiden mit systematisch variierenden Syntheseparametern genutzt. The aim of {{this study}} was the {{research}} of methods for the synthesis of metal sulfide nanoparticles and the subsequent development of a high-throughput synthesis method for metal sulfide nanoparticles. One approach used an inverse microemulsion with a nonionic surfactant as <b>precipitation</b> <b>medium</b> for the nanoparticles. The other approach aimed at the synthesis of layered type transition metal chalcogenides by chemical vapour deposition. A reactor setup was custom built for this purpose. The chemical vapour deposition setup was used for the synthesis of 2 H-MoS 2 nanoparticles with an average crystallite size of 4 nm. The precursors H 2 S and Mo(CO) 6 were used. In case of the microemulsion synthesis the sulfide anion precursors TMTMS, CS 2, Lawesson 2 ̆ 7;s Reagent and gaseous H 2 S were investigated. H 2 S was found to be the most suitable precursor for the synthesis of a broad range of metal sulfides. Nanocrystalline and/or amorphous sulfides of Cd, Zn, Cu, Fe, Mo, Pt, Pd, Rh, Re, Ru, Ag, Au as well as (Cu,M) mixed sulfides (M=Zn, Fe, Ni) were precipitated. In case of nanocrystalline materials average crystallite sizes of 3 - 19 nm were determined from the PXRD data. A ninefold parallel reactor setup with an integrated membrane filtration unit was designed and constructed as a first step towards high-throughput synthesis of metal sulfide nanoparticles. With the aid of the parallel reactor the synthesis of CdS, Ag 2 S and (Ag,Cu) mixed sulfides was investigated for varying synthesis parameters...|$|E
40|$|The {{differential}} phase (ΦDP) measured by polarimetric radars is recognized to {{be a very}} good indicator of the path integrated by rain. Moreover, if a linear relationship is assumed between the specific {{differential phase}} (KDP) and the specific attenuation (AH) and specific differential attenuation (ADP), then attenuation can easily be corrected. The coefficients of proportionality, γH and γDP, are, however, known to be dependent in rain upon drop temperature, drop shapes, drop size distribution, and the presence of large drops causing Mie scattering. In this paper, the authors extensively apply a physically based method, often referred to as the “Smyth and Illingworth constraint,” which uses the constraint that the value of the differential reflectivity ZDR on the far side of the storm should be low to retrieve the γDP coefficient. More than 30 convective episodes observed by the French operational C-band polarimetric Trappes radar during two summers (2005 and 2006) are used to document the variability of γDP with respect to the intrinsic three-dimensional characteristics of the attenuating cells. The Smyth and Illingworth constraint could be applied to only 20 % of all attenuated rays of the 2 -yr dataset so it cannot be considered the unique solution for attenuation correction in an operational setting but is useful for characterizing the properties of the strongly attenuating cells. The range of variation of γDP is shown to be extremely large, with minimal, maximal, and mean values being, respectively, equal to 0. 01, 0. 11, and 0. 025 dB °− 1. Coefficient γDP appears to be almost linearly correlated with the horizontal reflectivity (ZH), differential reflectivity (ZDR), and specific differential phase (KDP) and correlation coefficient (ρHV) of the attenuating cells. The temperature effect is negligible with respect to that of the microphysical properties of the attenuating cells. Unusually large values of γDP, above 0. 06 dB °− 1, often referred to as “hot spots,” are reported for 15 %—a nonnegligible figure—of the rays presenting a significant total differential phase shift (ΔϕDP > 30 °). The corresponding strongly attenuating cells are shown to have extremely high ZDR (above 4 dB) and ZH (above 55 dBZ), very low ρHV (below 0. 94), and high KDP (above 4 ° km− 1). Analysis of 4 yr of observed raindrop spectra does not reproduce such low values of ρHV, suggesting that (wet) ice is likely to be present in the <b>precipitation</b> <b>medium</b> and responsible for the attenuation and high phase shifts. Furthermore, if melting ice is responsible for the high phase shifts, this suggests that KDP may not be uniquely related to rainfall rate but can result from the presence of wet ice. This hypothesis is supported by the analysis of the vertical profiles of horizontal reflectivity and the values of conventional probability of hail indexes...|$|E
