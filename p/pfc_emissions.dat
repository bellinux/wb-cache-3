50|$|For Washington {{state in}} particular, energy related {{emissions}} are the dominant source of GHG emissions and have increased from 61.2 MMT CO2-equivalent (CO2-e) in 1990 (excluding residual fuel for transportation) to 74.6 MMT CO2-e in 2004, while their share {{has increased from}} 79% of total emissions to 85% over the past fourteen years. Carbon dioxide is the dominant GHG followed by methane, nitrous oxide, perfluorocarbon and sulfur hexafluoride. Non-energy industrial global greenhouse gas emissions have lowered from 14% to 9%,mainly due to reduced emissions from aluminum production. This has {{been the result of}} two key elements: process changes that reduced CO2 and <b>PFC</b> <b>emissions</b> per ton of aluminumgenerated, and the post-2000 decline in aluminum manufacturing rates. Non-energy agriculturalgreenhouse emissions have remained fairly constant but their percentage contribution has lowered as total emissions have increased. Here is a broken down list of pollution contributors in Washington State: 45% transportation, 16% in state electricity generation, 12% industry, 9% residential and commercial, 2% non-CO2 (other gasses), 9% industry (non-energy), 7% agriculture (non-energy). As you can see, the majority of energy GHG emissions and almost half of total emissions are from the transportation sector.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} downsides of the current {{aluminium}} production process is the high CO 2 emission. One alternative is to replace the consumable carbon anodes with inert anodes so that oxygen evolves instead of CO 2. Also <b>PFC</b> <b>emissions</b> will be eliminated by using inert anodes. However, so far a sufficiently inert anode has not been found. Another option is to utilize natural gas through porous anodes in order to change the anode process. This will decrease CO 2 emission remarkably and also eliminate <b>PFC</b> <b>emissions</b> and anode effect. The porous anode could be made of carbon {{or it can be}} inert. However, the as-mentioned problem still exists regarding porous inert anodes. Therefore, at the moment porous carbon anodes seem to be the best practical option. In this study, porous anodes made of different grades of graphite were used for electrolysis experiments in a laboratory cell. Also, off-gas analysis was performed to get an insight of the ongoing reactions. Our results show that for some types of graphite anodes, methane participates effectively in the anodic reaction...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{aluminum}} {{industry is}} continually {{working to improve}} production efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and enhance environmental performance. As part of EPA's Voluntary Aluminum Industrial Partnership (VAIP) Program, eleven U. S. primary producers are focusing on reducing the duration and frequency of anode effects (AEs), which reduce production efficiency and generate two perfluorocarbons (PFCs), CF 4 and C 2 F 6. PFCs effectively trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect. To better understand <b>PFC</b> <b>emissions</b> and key factors influencing their generation, VAIP has sponsored two PFC measurement programs. The results {{of the first round}} of measurements were reported at the 1998 TMS meeting in San Antonio and appeared in Light Metals 1998, pp 277 - 285. This paper reports on the second, data-intensive program, which was conducted in 1999 at six primary production facilities. At each facility, PFCs were measured from the potroom exhaust ducts using continuous mass spectrometry. Fugitive emissions were sampled from roof exhausts and measured by FTIR spectrometry. Emissions were related to facility operational parameters such as AE frequency, AE duration, and AE over-voltage. The real-time measurement capability of the mass spectrometer provides the ability to generate highly time- resolved emissions profiles of individual anode effects. This information gives new insights into the factors influencing emissions, in addition to estimating overall facility emissions. Several facilities provided data on the voltage profiles of individual anode effects, which has shown correlation to emissions in both bench-scale laboratory studies at MIT and other measurements.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of Kyoto {{protocol}} for reducing green house gases and the identification of perfluorocarbons (PFC&# 146;s) emitted during anode effect (AE) in the aluminium electrolysis process as a major source and increasing in global aluminium production capacities, efforts to prevent and control AE have become very important. Much fundamental information on the initiating cause of AE, and the electrochemistry {{have been published in}} the last six decades. Modern control systems at most smelters should apply this knowledge and prevent AE, but in reality don&# 146;t perform as well as expected. While the electrolysis is continuous, manual interventions are still needed, and not all the relevant process parameters are capable of being sensed and controlled directly. Due to this, the process gets disturbed and with subjective decisions, the root cause of each AE gets obscured. No study has been published analysing these causes. They can be due to actions taken by man, performance of equipment and materials as well deviation from control parameters. This study focussed on these previously ignored aspects in order to determine their importance, develop early identification and remedies. Scientific methodology was employed in a smelter with a range of cell technologies and work practices involving extensive data analysis and follow up trials to address root causes, implementing remedies to prevent recurrence. Variables significantly affecting AE frequency were current density, energy balance, algorithms for controls, feeder and breaker design, as well as operational practices. A new logic was introduced to predict AE&# 146;s early reducing AE frequency by 30 - 70 %. AE duration was reduced from 45 to 25 seconds in a potline through refinements in control system. At the start of this investigation the average <b>PFC</b> <b>emission</b> at the smelter was 0. 24 t CO 2 equivalent / t Al and the end a figure of 0. 12 t CO 2 equivalent / t Al.

40|$|Carbon tetrafluoride (CF 4 or PFC- 14) is {{a potent}} {{greenhouse}} gas that is almost 7400 times more effective (100 -yr horizon) than CO 2 on a per molecule basis (IPCC, 2007). This high global warming potential, coming from its medium absorbance combined with a very long atmospheric lifetime (> 50000 years; Ravishankara et al., 1993), makes CF 4 a key species among the various greenhouse gases targeted by the Kyoto Protocol. In the Northern hemisphere, current atmospheric CF 4 concentrations are close to 78 pptv, with a large fraction (around 35 pptv, Mühle et al., 2010) coming from natural processes like lithospheric emissions (Harnisch and Eisenhauer, 1998). In addition, CF 4 has been used increasingly since the eighties in electronic and semiconductors industry. The primary aluminum production processes have also been clearly identified as an important anthropogenic source of CF 4 emissions. The partitioning between these two main sources is however problematic, principally due to lacking or incomplete CF 4 emission factors from inventories performed in industrial fields (e. g. International Aluminum Institute, 2009). Recent in situ ground level measurements of CF 4 in the Northern hemisphere (Khalil et al., 2003; Mühle et al., 2010) or remotely from space (Rinsland et al., 2006) have indicated a significant slowdown in the increase rate of atmospheric CF 4. This probably results from measures adopted by the aluminum industry aiming at {{the reduction of the}} frequency and duration of “anode effects” and therefore of related <b>PFCs</b> <b>emissions</b> (International Aluminum Institute, 2009).

ACC activity was independently predicted by age and decision-making accuracy, indicating that in older individuals ACC response is more sensitive to declining performance. We also found strong functional connectivity between the ACC and lateral PFC and observed that activation of the lateral PFC was qualitatively different over time in different age groups. Thus, the ACC and lateral PFC show distinct responses to age-related decline in decision-making performance. This suggests that greater cognitive control is employed as individuals age and their performance declines...|$|R

Samples used in this study included 14 global semiconductor firms, each of which was treated as a decision making units (DMUs) under DEA analysis. The empirical result reveals that the overall technical inefficiencies of the firms are due primarily to pure technical inefficiencies rather than the scale inefficiencies.

40|$|Global {{emission}} estimates {{based on}} new atmospheric observations are presented for the acylic {{high molecular weight}} perfluorocarbons (PFCs) : decafluorobutane (C 4 F 10), dodecafluoropentane (C 5 F 12), tetradecafluorohexane (C 6 F 14), hexadecafluoroheptane (C 7 F 16) and octadecafluorooctane (C 8 F 18). Emissions are estimated using a 3 -dimensional chemical transport model and an inverse method that includes a growth constraint on emissions. The observations used in the inversion are based on newly measured archived air samples that cover a 39 -yr period, from 1973 to 2011, and include 36 Northern Hemispheric and 46 Southern Hemispheric samples (Ivy et al., 2012). The derived emission estimates show that global emission rates were largest in the 1980 s and 1990 s for C 4 F 10 and C 5 F 12, and in the 1990 s for C 6 F 14,C 7 F 16 and C 8 F 18. After a subsequent decline, emissions have remained relatively stable, within 20 %, for the last 5 yr. Bottom-up emission estimates {{are available from the}} Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research version 4. 2 (EDGARv 4. 2) for C 4 F 10, C 5 F 12, C 6 F 14 and C 7 F 16, and inventories of C 4 F 10, C 5 F 12 andC 6 F 14 are reported to the United Nations' Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) by Annex 1 countries that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol. The atmospheric measurement based emission estimates are 20 times larger than EDGARv 4. 2 for C 4 F 10 and over three orders of magnitude for C 5 F 12. The derived emission estimates for C 6 F 14 largely agree with the bottom-up estimates from EDGARv 4. 2. Moreover, the C 7 F 16 emission estimates are comparable to those of EDGARv 4. 2 at their peak in the 1990 s, albeit significant underestimation for the other time periods. There are no bottom-up emission estimates for C 8 F 18, thus the emission rates reported here are the first for C 8 F 18. The reported inventories for C 4 F 10, C 5 F 12 and C 6 F 14 to UNFCCC are five to ten times lower than those estimated in this study. In addition, we present measured infrared absorption spectra for C 7 F 16 and C 8 F 18, and estimate their radiative efficiencies and global warming potentials (GWPs). We find that C 8 F 18 's radiative efficiency is similar to trifluoromethyl sulfur pentafluoride's (SF 5 CF 3) at 0. 57 W m − 2 ppb − 1, which is the highest radiative efficiency of any measured atmospheric species. Using the 100 -yr time horizon GWPs, the high molecular weight perfluorocarbons studied here contributed up to 15. 4 % of the total <b>PFC</b> <b>emissions</b> in CO 2 equivalents in 1997 and 6 % of the total <b>PFC</b> <b>emissions</b> in 2009...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric {{observations}} and atmospheric observation-based global emission estimates are presented {{for the five}} high molecular weight perfluorocarbons (PFCs) : decafluorobutane (C 4 F 1 0), dodecafluoropentane (C 5 F 1 2), tetradecafluorohexane (C 6 F 14), hexadecafluoroheptane (C 7 F 16) and octadecafluorooctane (C 8 F 18). Their atmospheric histories are based on measurements of 36 Northern Hemisphere and 46 Southern Hemisphere archived air samples, collected between 1973 and 2011, using two of the "Medusa" cryogenic preconcentration gas chromatography-mass spectrometry instruments, which {{are part of the}} Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE). A new calibration scale was prepared for each PFC, with estimated accuracies of 6. 8 % for C 4 Fi 0, 7. 8 % for C 5 F 12, 4. 0 % for CF 14, 6. 6 % for C 7 FE 16 and 7. 9 % for CF 8 i. Based on our observations, the 2011 globally averaged dry air mole fractions of these high molecular weight PFCs are: 0. 17 parts-per-trillion (ppt, i. e., parts per 1012) for C 4 F 10, 0. 12 ppt for C 5 F 1 2, 0. 27 ppt for CF 1 4, 0. 12 ppt for CFE 16 and 0. 09 ppt for CF 18. Newly measured infrared absorption spectra are presented for C 7 F 16 and CF 1 8, and using these, their radiative efficiencies and global warming potentials (GWPs) are estimated. We find that the radiative efficiency of C 8 F 18 at 0. 57 Wm- 2 ppb-' {{is similar to that of}} trifluoromethyl sulfur pentafluoride's (SF 5 CF 3), which has the highest radiative efficiency of any known atmospheric species (Forster et al., 2007). Using their radiative efficiencies, the 2011 observed globally averaged atmospheric mole fractions of the above five high molecular weight PFCs combine to contribute a global average radiative forcing of 0. 35 mW m- 2, which is 6 % of the total anthropogenic PFC radiative forcing (Montzka et al., 2011; Oram et al., 2012). Global emissions for C 4 Fio, C 5 F 12, C 6 F 14, C 7 F 16 and CF 18 were estimated from the observations using a 3 -dimensional chemical transport model and a Bayseian inverse method that included a constraint on the annual growth rate of their emissions, consistent with the knowledge of the relevant industries emitting them (Rigby et al., 2011). The derived so-called "top-down" emission estimates show that global emission rates were largest in the 1980 s and 1990 s for C 4 F 10 and C 5 F 12 and in the 1990 s for C 6 F 14, C 7 F 16 and C 8 F 1. After a subsequent decline, emission rates have remained relatively stable, within ± 20 % year-to-year variation, for the last 5 years. Using their calculated 100 -year time horizon GWPs, the high molecular weight perfluorocarbons studied here contributed up to 15. 4 % of the total <b>PFC</b> <b>emissions</b> expressed in carbon dioxide (C 0 2) -equivalents in 1997 and 6 % of the total <b>PFC</b> <b>emissions</b> in 2009. Furthermore, we compare our atmospheric observation-based global emissions to the available so-called "bottom-up" inventories, which are based on production information and end usage. Bottom-up emission estimates are available from the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research version 4. 2 (EDGARv 4. 2) for C 4 F 1 o, C 5 F 1 2, C 6 F 1 4 and C 7 F 16, and emission inventories of C 4 Fio, C 5 F 1 2 and C 6 F 14 are also reported to the United Nations' Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) by Annex 1 countries that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol (European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC) /Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL), 2009; United National Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat, 2011). The atmospheric observation-based emission estimates are 20 times larger than EDGARv 4. 2 for C 4 F 10 and over three orders of magnitude larger for C 5 F 1 2. In contrast, the top-down emission estimates for C 6 F 14 largely agree with the bottom-up estimates from EDGARv 4. 2. Moreover, the top-down C 7 F 16 emission estimates are comparable to those of EDGARv 4. 2 at their peak in the 1990 s, albeit with significant underestimation by EDGARv 4. 2 for the other time periods. There are no bottom-up emission estimates for C 8 Fi 8, thus the emission rates reported here are the first for this gas. In general, the emission inventories for C 4 Fio, C 5 F 1 2 and C 6 F 14 reported to the UNFCCC are five to ten times lower than those estimated in this study from observations. This underreporting to the UNFCCC may be due to only Annex 1 countries reporting inventories and also that some of these countries report a total PFC mixture in C 0 2 -equivalents, instead of individual <b>PFC</b> <b>emissions</b> rates. by Diane Jean Ivy.

40|$|Perfluorocompounds (PFCs) {{are highly}} stable {{chemical}} compounds used in two integral steps of semiconductor manufacturing: {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) chambers and etch chambers. Unfortunately, PFCs are also greenhouse gases linked to global warming. This, combined with their long atmospheric lifetimes gives them global warming potentials much higher than C 02 the principal greenhouse gas. In a series of voluntary agreements with the United States and other national governments, the worldwide semiconductor industry has {{set a goal of}} reducing <b>PFC</b> <b>emissions</b> to 90 % of their 1995 levels. To reach this goal, researchers have explored four main methods of reduction: substitution of PFCs, recovery and recycling of PFCs, tool optimization, and exhaust abatement. While the first three methods have successfully reduced emissions in the CVD chambers, they have proven too costly for or inapplicable to etch chambers. Therefore, it has become apparent that further reductions must be achieved through the abatement of etch chamber exhaust. Herein, we compare three commercially available abatement systems representative of the three techniques currently used to abate PFCs. All three systems are categorized as either downstream systems, which receive diluted exhaust from multiple etch chambers, or point-of-use (POU) systems, which receive concentrated exhaust from a single etch chamber. Though both downstream and POU configurations are equally effective in destroying PFCs, they differ in cost depending on the number of etch chambers in use and the dilution rate per chamber. Given these numbers, our Microsoft Excel-based cost model computes the total cost of each of the three commercial systems, allowing the user to determine which system is most economical for a specific factory setting...|$|E

Here we present the first continuous records of the atmospheric abundance of CF 4 (PFC- 14), C 2 F 6 (PFC- 116) and C 3 F 8 (PFC- 218) from 1800 to 2014. The records are derived from high-precision measurements of PFCs in air extracted from polar firn or ice at six sites (DE 08, DE 08 - 2, DSSW 20 K, EDML, NEEM and South Pole) and air archive tanks and atmospheric air sampled from both hemispheres. We {{take account of the}} age characteristics of the firn and ice core air samples and demonstrate excellent consistency between the ice core, firn and atmospheric measurements. We present an inversion for global emissions from 1900 to 2014. We also formulate the inversion to directly infer emission factors for <b>PFC</b> <b>emissions</b> due to aluminium production prior to the 1980 s. We show that 19 th century atmospheric levels, before significant anthropogenic influence, were stable at 34 : 1 � 0 : 3 ppt for CF 4 and below detection limits of 0. 002 and 0. 01 ppt for C 2 F 6 and C 3 F 8, respectively. We find a significant peak in CF 4 and C 2 F 6 emissions around 1940, most likely due to the high demand for aluminium during World War II, for example for construction of aircraft, but these emissions were nevertheless much lower than in recent years. The PFC emission factors for aluminium production in the early 20 th century were significantly higher than today but have decreased since then due to improvements and better control of the smelting process. Mitigation efforts have led to decreases in emissions from peaks in 1980 (CF 4) or early-to-mid- 2000 s (C 2 F 6 and C 3 F 8) despite the continued increase in global aluminium production; however, these decreases in emissions appear to have recently halted.

40|$|For {{government}} policy decisions- regarding global warming {{or any other}} problem- to be meaningful and useful, the data that underpin them must be reasonably accurate, i. e. their inaccuracy should not be so great that wrong measures or wrong priorities are agreed. The data must be robust enough to support the decision at hand. In the case of HFC (and by inference, <b>PFC)</b> <b>emissions,</b> current estimates in developed countries are too inaccurate; they lead to the wrong priorities in policy, and perhaps the wrong measures. This inaccuracy can be shown in examples, and it already has been recognised by the UNFCCC. Accuracy can be improved both procedurally and methodologically. Some methods tested in chemical-market analysis could be adapted for use in estimating HFC/PFC emissions. 1 Forecasts of HFC Emissions Are Inaccurate The UK – {{a country that has}} taken the UNFCCC process seriously – appears to have underestimated HFC emissions seriously. The UNFCCC has stated that current, official estimates of fluorocarbon emissions in countries other than the UK are even less adequate. More examples of the wide range of estimates for emissions of this type are shown in a study commissioned by the German Federal Environmental Agency i. 1. 1 Why is the UK Estimate Inaccurate? A peer-reviewed study by Atlantic Consulting ii has shown that the contribution of HFCs to UK global warming emissions in 2010 is at least three times greater than the current estimates iii [pp 59, 67 and 69] of the UK Dept. of Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR), which were not peer-reviewed. It appears that the main reason for the different estimates is in the assumptions made of leak rates. DETR's latest estimates of leak rates [Ref iii, Table A 3, p A. 4] are simply unrealistic. As the peer-reviewed study by Atlantic Consulting shows [Ref ii], these sorts of rates could be achieved only under strict government regulation, and this is not what DETR means by a 'Business-as-Usual ' scenario. 1 The leak rates shown in figure 1 tell the story in figures – the UK and other governments have underestimated HFC emissions...|$|E
40|$|The plasma {{abatement}} system co-developed by Rf Environmental, Inc. and Texas A & M University {{has been effective}} at destroying the global warming gases CF 4 and C 4 F 8. The destruction of greenhouse gases, specifically perfluorocompounds, hydrofluorocompounds, chlorofluorocompounds (PFCs, HFCs, CFCs) and SF 6, is paramount to significantly affecting atmospheric pollution. The premise {{of this study was}} to examine the design of the plasma {{abatement system}} for Global Warming Gases (GWGs) and its abatement potential for these gases. The first goal was to reduce the cost of ownership by examining the cooling system. The cost of an air cooling design was $ 1400 /yr. The intent was to reduce the amount of air used or use a different medium that would produce the same amount of heat transfer. A liquid cooling system design had a cost of only $ 150 /yr. A C 4 F 8 abatement experiment was run on the liquid cooling design. The abatement process resulted in a destruction removal efficiency (DRE) of C 4 F 8 of 97. 5 percent. A lower operational cost unit was developed, but the operational performance was less than previous investigations. The second goal was to simulate the semiconductor radio frequency etching process and abate the output gases of the C 4 F 8 and SiO 2 reaction. The outcomes of this experiment included a microwave simulation of the radio frequency etching reaction and an abatement that resulted in a 99. 98 plus/minus. 05 percent DRE for C 4 F 8 with no formation of any other CFC gases. The third goal was to simulate the etching process and abate the output gas, CF 4 using H 2 O vapor as the additive gas. The outcomes of this experiment included a microwave simulation of the radio frequency etching reaction and an abatement that resulted in a 99. 96 plus/minus. 05 percent DRE for CF 4 with no formation of any other CFC gases. A low cost of ownership and effective abatement levels will make this system viable for commercial use. The latest data shows the amount of <b>PFC</b> <b>emissions</b> from the semiconductor industry was 3. 6 Tg CO 2 Eq. The use of this or a similar abatement technology will have a significant impact on reducing environmental pollution...|$|E
40|$|The first {{atmospheric}} {{observations and}} trends are presented {{for the high}} molecular weight perfluorocarbons (PFCs) : decafluorobutane (C 4 F 10), dodecafluoropentane (C 5 F 12), tetradecafluorohexane (C 6 F 14), hexadecafluoroheptane (C 7 F 16) and octadecafluorooctane (C 8 F 18). Their atmospheric histories are based on measurements of 38 Northern Hemisphere and 46 Southern Hemisphere archived air samples collected between 1973 to 2011 using the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) "Medusa" preconcentration gas chromatography-mass spectrometry systems. A new calibration scale was prepared for each PFC, with estimated accuracies of 6. 8 % for C 4 F 10, 7. 8 % for C 5 F 12, 4. 0 % for C 6 F 14, 6. 6 % for C 7 F 16 and 7. 9 % for C 8 F 18. Based on our observations the 2011 globally averaged dry air mole fractions of these heavy PFCs are: 0. 18 parts-per-trillion (ppt, i. e., parts per 10 12) for C 4 F 10, 0. 12 ppt for C 5 F 12, 0. 28 ppt for C 6 F 14, 0. 12 ppt for C 7 F 16 and 0. 09 ppt for C 8 F 18. These atmospheric mole fractions combine {{to contribute to a}} global average radiative forcing of 0. 35 mW m − 2, which is 3. 6 % of the total PFC radiative forcing. The globally averaged mean atmospheric growth rates of these PFCs during 1973 – 2011 are 4. 58 parts per quadrillion (ppq, i. e., parts per 10 15) per year (yr) for C 4 F 10, 3. 29 ppq yr − 1 for C 5 F 12, 7. 50 ppq yr − 1 for C 6 F 14, 3. 19 ppq yr − 1 for C 7 F 16 and 2. 51 ppq yr − 1 for C 8 F 18. The growth rates of the heavy perfluorocarbons were largest in the early 1990 s for C 4 F 10 and C 5 F 12 and in the mid-to-late 1990 s for C 6 F 14, C 7 F 16 and C 8 F 18. The more recent slow down in the growth rates of the high molecular weight PFCs suggests that emissions are declining as compared to the 1980 s and 1990 s. Nevertheless continued monitoring of these potent, extremely long-lived greenhouse gases is necessary to verify that global <b>PFC</b> <b>emissions</b> continue to decline...|$|E
