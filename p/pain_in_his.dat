5|$|Asashōryū {{got off to}} a bad {{start in}} the July tournament by losing to Toyonoshima on the first day. After a second loss to maegashira Tochinonada on day five, he pulled out of the tournament on the sixth day citing <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> elbow. The September tournament {{unfolded}} in a similarly poor fashion. After compiling a lacklustre 5–4 record through the first nine days, Asashōryū forfeited his tenth-day match to maegashira Gōeidō and withdrew. He had elbow pain, and presented a medical certificate.|$|E
5|$|England {{then started}} their reply, and Lindwall took the new ball and felt <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> groin again after {{delivering}} his first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered through the pain. Seeing that Lindwall {{was able to}} bowl through the pain, Bradman tossed the ball to Miller for the second over to see if Miller could bowl. However, Miller threw the ball back, indicating that his body {{would not be able}} to withstand it. This resulted in media consternation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.|$|E
60|$|Macky. He sets up for {{a critic}} in conversation, makes jests, and loves to laugh at them; takes {{a great deal of}} <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> office, and is in a fair way of rising at court.--Swift. This is right enough, but he has little sincerity.|$|R
50|$|Gordon Peacock, a J-HHS {{student and}} member of the Tiger {{football}} team, was injured during a practice <b>in</b> 1934.

5|$|In January 1934 the Black Hawks {{were on a}} train back to Chicago when Gardiner felt {{an intense}} <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> throat that spread {{to the rest of}} his body, notably his kidneys. When {{questioned}} by Tommy Gorman about his issue, Gardiner lied to Gorman and insisted it was only a minor headache. However, when Gardiner woke up on the train in the morning, he had trouble seeing, as black spots obscured his vision. This was Gardiner's first uremic convulsion.|$|E
5|$|Led by Jim Peplinski, an alumni {{game was}} {{organized}} for Saturday, February 19, at McMahon. The game featured 14 {{members of the}} Flames' 1989 Stanley Cup championship team, including Lanny McDonald, Al MacInnis, Joel Otto, Theoren Fleury and Joe Nieuwendyk. For Nieuwendyk, {{at the time the}} General Manager of the Dallas Stars, the chance to participate in the game was important enough that he chose to overlook the chronic <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> back when he is on skates. Immensely popular forward Craig Conroy, who retired only {{a few weeks before the}} game, also took part for Calgary.|$|E
5|$|Quwatli had a {{heart attack}} shortly after the Six Day War (5–10 June 1967). Feeling a <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chest he was taken to a {{hospital}} on 29 June. He died in Beirut on 30 June. According to Syrian historian Sami Moubayed, Quwatli died after learning of the defeat of the Syrian and Arab armies. The Ba'athist-dominated government refused to allow Quwatli's body to be buried in Damascus and only relented after diplomatic pressure from King Faisal of Saudi Arabia. An honorary funeral organized by the state was held for him on 1 July.|$|E
5000|$|While {{filming the}} scene in which Ted dances to [...] "Theme from Shaft," [...] Tommy Tiernan {{continually}} flubbed his lines. As a result, Dermot Morgan was required to perform the dance repeatedly, despite <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> heart. <b>In</b> a 2009 interview, Tiernan speculated that this contributed to Morgan's fatal heart attack the following day.|$|R
5000|$|Waller, {{with the}} then physio Dave Galley, both famously {{diagnosed}} the seriousness with Gérard Houllier's chest pains during the half time interval during the 2001 Liverpool game against Leeds United, which {{eventually led to}} an emergency operation on Houllier's heart. Houllier was giving a half-time team talk when he felt <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chest.|$|R
60|$|Nasmyth closed {{one hand}} tight. Waynefleet, who {{had found the}} {{constant}} wetting too much for him, had left the cañon {{a week or two}} before this morning, on which it was evident a crisis of some sort was near. He had complained of severe <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> back and joints, and had sent them no word after his departure.|$|R
5|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} in {{his left}} knee, which spread to the right knee, ankles, elbows, wrists and hands, stopped him from making {{a career out of}} football. Despite often being in agony during training, he managed to play part-time for Hereford United, including in the first team when they were in the fourth, and later in the third, division of the English Football League. He was earning up to £33 a week. But in 1973, at the age of 21, the <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> joints became so severe that he was forced to retire.|$|E
5|$|After {{missing the}} Tournament of Americas Olympic Qualifiers over the summer, Miami's eight {{pre-season}} games and first seven regular season games {{to recover from}} off-season left knee and left shoulder surgeries, Wade made his first appearance of the 2007–08 season on November 14, 2007. Battling <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> left knee throughout the season, Wade was elected to his fourth consecutive All-Star Game appearance. However, with the Heat holding the worst record in the NBA and Wade still experiencing problems in his left knee, Heat coach Pat Riley announced Wade would miss the final 21 {{games of the season}} to undergo OssaTron treatment on his left knee. Wade averaged 24.6 points, 6.9 assists, 4.2 rebounds, and 1.7 steals per game for the season.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the injury}} was still {{believed}} to be minor and Cloutier volunteered to continue playing in lieu of backup Mathieu Garon also being sidelined with a broken finger. When the <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hip quickly got worse, Cloutier appealed to team management. He saw a specialist who diagnosed him with a torn hip labrum and told him the injury could put his career in jeopardy. He was subsequently flown to Colorado for surgery on January 12, 2007. Cloutier remained in Colorado for ongoing treatment and was lodged by the organization in a motel 31 {{miles away from the}} clinic. The Kings' original insistence that he play and his subsequent lodging proved to be a contentious issue for Cloutier.|$|E

6000|$|... "True," [...] {{answered}} the donkey; [...] "but {{there are other}} things that cause <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> the stomach. You know there is a certain island in Rootbeer River that is made of fruit cake of a very rich quality.

Presently he will have violent <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> stomach and will be punished as greatly as you could desire." ...|$|R

5|$|Caracciola and {{his wife}} Alice {{returned}} to their home in Lugano. For {{the duration of the}} war he was unable to drive; the rationing of petrol meant motor racing was unfeasible. The <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> leg grew worse, and they went back to the clinic in Bologna to consult a specialist. Surgery was recommended, but Caracciola decided against that option, deterred by the minimum three months it would take to recover from the operation. He spent much of {{the last part of the}} war—from 1941 onwards—attempting to gain possession of the two W165s used at the 1939 Tripoli Grand Prix, with a view to maintaining them for the duration of the hostilities. When they finally arrived in Switzerland in early 1945, they were confiscated as German property by the Swiss authorities.|$|E
5|$|Hampered by terrible <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{left knee}} during the 1960–61 NHL season, Plante was sent {{down to the}} minor league Montreal Royals. Torn {{cartilage}} was found in his knee, and the knee was surgically repaired {{during the summer of}} 1961. The next season Plante became only the fourth goaltender to win the Hart Memorial Trophy – he also won the Vezina Trophy for the sixth time. The 1962–63 season was unsettling for Plante. His asthma had worsened, and he missed most of the early season. His relationship with his coach, Toe Blake, continued to deteriorate because of Plante's persistent health problems. Later, Plante {{was at the center of}} a major controversy when he claimed that net sizes in the NHL were not uniform, thus giving a statistical advantage to goaltenders playing for the Chicago Black Hawks, Boston Bruins, and New York Rangers. His claim was later confirmed as the result of a manufacturing error.|$|E
5|$|He {{began to}} feel <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> lower back shortly {{after the end of}} his junior season. In May 2011, while {{attending}} a basketball camp at the Deron Williams Academy in Chicago, Arcidiacono complained of poor mobility and soreness. He was diagnosed with a herniated disk in his back, forcing him to miss his senior season. Arcidiacono had surgery to repair the disk on December 21, and he could not leave his house for two weeks thereafter. Arcidiacono finished his career at Neshaminy High School as the program's all-time leading scorer. He tallied 1,498 points, 449 rebounds, 378 assists, 178 steals, and 160 three-pointers. Despite missing the season, ESPNU ranked him among the top 50 seniors in the country.|$|E
50|$|During {{the first}} stage of the 2010 Rally d'Italia Sardegna Wilks crashed his Škoda and was flown to {{hospital}} after reporting <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> lower back. Hospital checks found the Wilks had fractures to his first and second lumbar vertebrae. The injury meant that Wilks missed three events on the IRC Calendar making a comeback at the Barum Czech Rally Zlín at the end of August.|$|R
50|$|After {{suffering}} from <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> shoulders <b>in</b> late 2007, he undertook an X-Ray examination under instruction from <b>his</b> doctor <b>in</b> May 2008, which revealed he was {{suffering from}} lung cancer, despite never having smoked. Humphrys confirmed <b>his</b> retirement <b>in</b> June 2008, before undertaking an interview with The Mail on Sunday in which he discussed his medical diagnosis. Before he died he completed his autobiography Not a Proper Journalist.|$|R
50|$|According to Kevin Booth, in the BBC {{documentary}} Dark Poet, it {{was during}} the early recording sessions for Arizona Bay, around Christmas 1992, that Hicks first started suffering from the <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> side, which would later be diagnosed as pancreatic cancer. Upon learning that he had developed cancer, Hicks used his time to mix music into Rant in E-Minor and Arizona Bay, calling it his Dark Side of the Moon.|$|R
5|$|His {{first and}} only major league {{appearance}} came against the Milwaukee Brewers on 17 September 1982. The first two batters he faced were Paul Molitor and Robin Yount, both future Hall of Famers, {{one of only a}} few players in history to do so. Partway through the first inning, he felt a twinge in his shoulder; not wanting to leave his first game early, he pitched through it, and allowed five runs in the first. Partway through the third, after three more runs allowed, Wever was taken out of the game. He pitched for 2⅔ innings and had eight earned runs, two strikeouts, and three wild pitches. Entering the 1983 season, Wever was projected to be the fifth starter in the Yankees' starting rotation. Because of continued <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> shoulder, he instead spent the season with the AAA Columbus Clippers, where he went 14 with a 9.78 ERA in seven appearances.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Richard {{started to}} {{complain}} of <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> left calf. The synthetic graft inserted in his July 1980 surgery had closed off, {{which meant that}} he needed a surgical bypass in his left leg. Richard was granted free agency by the Astros on November 7, 1983, but the Astros still had faith in him, so he was re-signed on February 17 of the following year. Just {{a little over two}} months later, he was released by the Astros, thus ending his baseball career. Despite an almost complete recovery, the risk of future complications was so great that he never pitched again. His final major league record was 107–71, with 1,493strikeouts and a 3.15ERA in 238games and 1,606innings. Nolan Ryan broke his Astros record for career strikeouts in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{took the}} new ball and felt <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> groin again after {{delivering}} his first ball. He persevered {{through the pain}} and removed Washbrook in his fourth over. Hutton then fell to Johnson to leave England at 32/2. Lindwall then clean bowled Edrich before doing the same to Dollery for a duck two balls later. England were 46/4 and Australia were firmly in control. Compton was joined by his skipper Yardley and the pair rebuilt the innings, scoring 87 runs together in 100 minutes. After the tea break, Lindwall and Johnston returned with the new ball. Compton edged Johnston to be out for 53. One run later, Lindwall bowled Yardley to leave England at 134/6 with their skipper dismissed for 44. Johnson then removed Evans for nine, before Coxon and Laker added 41 for the eighth wicket. After 85 minutes of resistance, Johnston removed both. England's last pair added ten runs to close at stumps on 9/207.|$|E
5000|$|However, as Devol {{told the}} story, Jones cheated him first, and Devol simply repaid {{himself at the}} first opportunity. Devol also said that Jones was tow-haired, blue-eyed, never had a hair on his face or weighed more than 130 pounds, often complained of <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> head, and [...] "could turn monte {{with the best of}} them."

50|$|In an {{interview}} in 2009, comedian Tommy Tiernan, who acted with Morgan in the final episode of Father Ted, recalled filming the scene in which Ted dances to the Theme from Shaft. Tiernan continually flubbed his lines and, as a result, Morgan was required to perform the dance repeatedly, despite <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> heart. Tiernan believed this contributed to his fatal heart attack, which happened just 24 hours after they filmed the scene.|$|R
