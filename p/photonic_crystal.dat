The white colour in the butterfly family Pieridae is a derivative of uric acid, an excretory product. Bright blues, greens, reds and iridescence are usually created not by pigments but through the microstructure of the scales. This structural coloration {{is the result of}} coherent scattering of light by the <b>photonic</b> <b>crystal</b> nature of the scales. The specialised scales that provide structural colours to reflected light mostly produce ultra-violet patterns which are discernible {{in that part of the}} ultra-violet spectrum that lepidopteran eyes can see. The structural colour seen is often dependent upon the angle of view. For example, in Morpho cypris, the colour from the front is a bright blue but when seen from an angle changes very quickly to black.|$|E
25|$|The {{emerging}} {{field of}} photonic crystals {{led to the}} development in 1991 of photonic-crystal fiber, which guides light by diffraction from a periodic structure, rather than by total internal reflection.

25|$|A common <b>photonic</b> <b>crystal</b> nanocavity design shown is {{essentially}} a <b>photonic</b> <b>crystal</b> with an intentional defect (holes missing). This structure having periodic changes in refractive index {{on the order of}} the length of the optical wavelength satisfies Bragg reflection conditions in the y and z directions for a particular wavelength range, and the slab boundaries in the x direction create another reflective boundary due to oblique reflection at dielectric boundaries. This results in theoretically perfect wave confinement in the y and z directions along the axis of a lattice row, and good confinement along the x direction. Since this confinement effect along the y and z directions (directions of the crystal lattice) is only for a range of frequencies, it has been referred to as a photonic bandgap, since there is a discrete set of photon energies which cannot propagate in the lattice directions in the material. However, because of the diffraction of waves propagating inside this structure, radiation energy does escape the cavity within the <b>photonic</b> <b>crystal</b> slab plane. The lattice spacing can be tuned to produce optimal boundary conditions of the standing wave inside the cavity to produce minimal loss and highest Q.|$|E

40|$|<b>Photonic</b> <b>crystals</b> {{can affect}} the {{behavior}} of visible light, and other electromagnetic waves, {{in ways that are}} not possible by other means. The propagation of photons can be completely forbidden or the the light can be made to follow a well- defined path. Fluorescent emission can be enhanced for some wavelengths or completely shut off for others, and it is possible to do all this simultaneously in a single structure. However, <b>photonic</b> <b>crystals</b> are very difficult to fabricate as they require precision patterning at sub-micron length scales. This fabrication difficulty has resulted in many of the potential applications for <b>photonic</b> <b>crystals</b> to currently be unrealized. Similarly, there is an abundance of opportunities to explore the workings of <b>photonic</b> <b>crystals</b> and also to develop exciting new methods for their fabrication. The content of this dissertation explores some methods for fabricating <b>photonic</b> <b>crystals,</b> including direct laser writing, interference lithography, colloidal deposition, and chemical vapor deposition. The angle-resolved characterization of <b>photonic</b> <b>crystals</b> is performed on fluorescent <b>photonic</b> <b>crystals</b> that exhibit uniquely photonic effects, which are explained with a simplified model of the electromagnetic wave-functions.
