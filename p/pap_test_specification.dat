Predisposing, enabling and reinforcing factors associated with ever having a <b>Pap</b> <b>test,</b> and having a recent <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> within the last 2 years, were assessed in Chinese women in British Columbia using the PRECEDE-PROCEED model. Method: Chinese women (n= 512) {{between the ages of}} 20 and 79 years and residing in Greater Vancouver were interviewed about <b>Pap</b> <b>testing,</b> health care, traditional health beliefs, acculturation and sociodemographic characteristics. Two analyses were done, comparing women who had ever and never had a <b>Pap</b> <b>test,</b> and comparing women who had and had not received a recent <b>Pap</b> <b>test.</b> Focus groups and qualitative interviews ensured cultural sensitivity in the survey questionnaire.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the risk of}} a histological diagnosis of cervical cancer following a given <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> result and for a given history of <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> results in a screened population across the full spectrum of possible cytological results. Methods: All the Pap screening results held on the New South Wales Pap Test Register for 1997 - 2003 (five million tests for 1. 87 million women) were analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the odds of having a histologically determined cervical cancer for a given <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> result and test result history. The hazard ratios of having cervical cancer in relation to <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> result histories were estimated: (i) in regard only to the last <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> result adjusting for age, frequency of <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> and proportion of high grade (≥cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 [CIN 2]) abnormalities found in a woman 2 ̆ 7 s total recorded test result history; and (ii) with regard to the last <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> result against the highest grade of cytological abnormality found prior to the last <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> result. The hazard ratios are for a cancer diagnosis occurring before the next <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> and were adjusted for age, quintile of socioeconomic status of residence, frequency of past <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> and proportion of high-grade abnormalities detected in each woman 2 ̆ 7 s prior <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> history. The adjusted hazard ratios were then applied to the tabulated proportions of referent women with negative cytology in each broad age group, and for all women, to estimate the 2 ̆ 71 in n 2 ̆ 7 odds of being diagnosed histologically with cervical cancer for a given last <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> result, and by a given last <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> result for various prior <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> result histories. Results: After adjusting for age, socioeconomic status, frequency of previous <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> and proportion of past high-grade screen-detected abnormalities, the adjusted hazard ratio of having a subsequent cervical cancer diagnosis for women with a negative <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> result was 1 in 5546, compared with 1 in 833 for a low-grade epithelial abnormality (atypia, CIN 1), 1 in 56 for a high-grade epithelial abnormality and 1 in seven for a cytological prediction of cervical cancer. These odds estimates were significantly modified by age and by the highest <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> result prior to the most recent <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> result: the higher the age and, less consistently, the higher the previous highest <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> result for a given last <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> result, the shorter the odds of having a subsequent histological diagnosis of cervical cancer. Conclusions: The results presented here will enable clinicians to inform their patients of their chances of being diagnosed with cervical cancer for a given <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> result, and for some combinations of the last <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> result and highest recorded prior <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> result...|$|R

40|$|Background: Cancer is {{the second}} {{leading cause of death}} in the United States, {{accounting}} for 22 % of all deaths among women. Despite the importance of the <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> in preventing and detecting cervical cancer, screening rates among poor women remain low. The pathways linking poverty with lower <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> use remain unclear. The screening disparity for this low-cost test suggests that poor women may face other transaction costs, opportunity costs and barriers in accessing <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> that are not faced by women living above poverty. Data/Methods: The data set merged the 2005 California Health Interview Survey, 2000 Census, and safety net clinic data. I examine elements of the patient-provider interaction (racial/ethnic discrimination) and healthcare system (distance to the nearest safety net clinic) as possible mediators between individual-level poverty and <b>Pap</b> <b>tests.</b> I then examine the role of individual-level poverty in moderating the association between discrimination and <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> use and safety net distance and <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> use. I also examine whether the neighborhood-level poverty moderates the association between individual-level poverty and <b>Pap</b> <b>tests,</b> discrimination and <b>Pap</b> <b>tests,</b> and distance and <b>Pap</b> <b>tests.</b> The sample included women, 18 - 64, with a physician visit in the previous 5 years and no history of cervical cancer. Mediation was tested using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) and a weighted product-of-coefficients test. Moderation was tested using GEE and including interaction terms. Results: Poor women were significantly less likely to report a timely <b>Pap</b> <b>test,</b> had significantly higher odds of reporting discrimination, and were more likely to reside closer to a safety net clinic. Discrimination did not predict <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> and was not a mediator between individual-level poverty and <b>Pap</b> <b>tests.</b> Safety net distance predicted <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> and was a mediator between individual-level poverty and <b>Pap</b> <b>tests.</b> Neither individual-level poverty nor neighborhood-level poverty modified the proposed relationships with <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> use. Conclusion: Racial/ethnic discrimination did not explain disparities in <b>Pap</b> <b>tests.</b> Proximity to a safety net clinic was shown to be protective against disparities and {{may play a role in}} addressing disparities in screening. Individual-level poverty and neighborhood-level poverty did not influence the role of proposed mediators in predicting <b>Pap</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

Evidence suggests that Chinese women’s reluctance to undergo <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> {{may be related to}} culture-linked discomfort with sexuality. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the role of sexuality in the interaction between acculturation and <b>Pap</b> <b>testing.</b> Design: Euro-Canadian (n! 213) and Chinese (n! 260) female university students completed a battery of questionnaires. Main Outcome Measures: Questionnaires assessing sexual knowledge, sexual func-tion, acculturation, and <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> frequency. Results: Euro-Canadian women had significantly more accurate sexual knowledge, higher levels of sexual functioning, a broader repertoire of sexual activities, and higher <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> rates. Chinese women were more likely to cite embarrassment as a barrier to <b>Pap</b> <b>testing.</b> Heritage acculturation, but not mainstream acculturation, predicted Chinese women’s <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> behavior.

This study aimed to determine the awareness and health beliefs of mothers about preventing cervical cancer in their daughters, their intention to recommend the <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> to their daughters, and the factors influencing this intention. Methods A cross-sectional survey design was employed, and the study enrolled mothers (n[*]=[*] 1, 581) of pubescent girls aged 13 to 18  years who were living nationwide in Korea. The six health-beliefs variables related to preventing cervical cancer in their daughters, awareness of the importance of cervical cancer prevention methods, and the intention to recommend the <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> to daughters were investigated. The impacts of these health beliefs of the mothers and the sociodemographic factors influencing their intention to recommend the <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> to their daughters were assessed using multiple logistic regression analysis. Results Almost one-quarter (23. 7  %) of the mothers had talked about the <b>Pap</b> <b>test,</b> 69. 2  % were intending to recommend the <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> to their daughters, and 38. 5  % considered that the <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> could be necessary if their daughters became sexually active. The significant health beliefs influencing the intention to recommend the <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> were the perceived barriers [odds ratio (OR) [*]=[*] 1. 47, 95  % confidence interval (95  % CI) [*]=[*] 1. 03 – 2. 11] and benefits (OR[*]=[*] 2. 25, 95  % CI[*]=[*] 1. 55 – 3. 25). The significant sociodemographic factors of mothers were their education (OR[*]=[*] 1. 52, 95  % CI[*]=[*] 1. 08 – 2. 13), their experience of talking about the <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> with their daughters (OR[*]=[*] 2. 11, 95  % CI[*]=[*] 1. 23 – 3. 64), their regularity of undergoing the <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> themselves (OR[*]=[*] 1. 98, 95  % CI[*]=[*] 1. 30 – 3. 03), and their age when they first underwent the <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> (OR[*]=[*] 1. 60, 95  % CI[*]=[*] 1. 43 – 0. 82). Conclusions The mothers perceived HPV vaccination as the most important of the five methods for preventing cervical cancer in their daughters. Mothers perceived the importance of their daughters undergoing the <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> regardless of the presence of HPV vaccination, and most of the mothers had an intention of recommending the <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> to their daughters.

40|$|Introduction: Endometrial {{cancer is}} the second most common {{gynecological}} tumor. There is still no recommended screening method for endometrial cancer. The application of transvaginal sonography, hysteroscopy and <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> may prove useful in screening for this disease. Atypical glandular cells represent an important finding in <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> and they are related to histopathological verification of the endometrium. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the usefulness of the <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> in assessing the cervical infiltration, as well as to determine the significance of hormonal status and histopathological type of tumor in a pathological <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> in patients with endometrial cancer. Methods : The study was retrospective. The analysis included the data obtained from 62 operated patients diagnosed with enometrial cancer, medical history (menopausal status), histopathological findings after surgery (type and stage of the disease) and a preoperative Pap smear. The chi squared and Fisher’s test were used. Results: The difference in the prevalence of pathological <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> in premenopausal and postmenopausal group of patients was not statistically significant.

40|$|Background: The {{reliability}} of patient history and clinical information on <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> requisitions {{has been questioned}} but not previously objectively determined. The effect of incomplete/inaccurate information on quality of patient care has not been previously quantified. Our objectives were (1) {{to find out how}} clinicians and their assistants viewed the requisition slip, and whether they understood the reasons for supplying the information requested, (2) to measure the completeness and accuracy of information on the requisition slips, and (3) to determine whether the clinical information and patient history provided on <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> requisitions could be relied upon to accurately assign a <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> to the laboratory&#x 2032;s "high-risk rescreen" pool. Methods: Clinicians and their assistants were surveyed. A total of 899 consecutive <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> requisition slips were reviewed. Patient history and clinical information from the slips were compared to data from our laboratory information system and/or electronic patient medical records. Results: Most survey respondents felt that proper completion of requisitions was important, but only 17 &#x 0025; of clinicians and less staff realized that negative high-risk <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> underwent a quality assurance rescreen. Clinicians and/or staff recorded the last menstrual period, specimen source, and clinical information on the requisition slips 96 &#x 0025;, 97 &#x 0025;, and 88 &#x 0025; of the time, respectively. Of 695 <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> with applicable computerized records, 172 (25 &#x 0025;) qualified for high-risk rescreen based upon information provided on the requisition slip alone. An additional 52 <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> (7 &#x 0025;), or 23 &#x 0025; of the total high-risk <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> were discovered to be of high risk only after review of the electronic records. Conclusions: Clinicians and staff were receptive to discussions concerning the completion of requisition slips, but laboratory expectations could be better communicated. Requisition slips were properly completed with a high frequency, but the check boxes did not elicit all the information expected, so revision was necessary. The high accuracy of the completion of requisition slips permitted 77 &#x 0025; of high-risk <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> to be identified via the requisition slip alone. Our findings challenge the conventional anecdotal impressions of "notoriously unreliable" information on <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> requisition slips, but our experience may not be applicable to other settings...|$|R
40|$|<b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> is a lifesaving tool {{which can}} detect {{atypical}} cellular changes before the cervical cancer develops. In developing countries just 5 % {{of women are}} typically screened for cervical cancer by <b>Pap</b> <b>test.</b> So having a risk factor assessment tool for the <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> cytological changes can be very helpful in order to approach an early diagnosis and treatment by physicians, midwives and the other health care givers in face with their clients. To develop a valid and reliable risk factors assessment tool for the <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> cytological changes towards cervical cancer. This is a methodological study. In order to identify full content domain, items generation and creation of the initial tool draft, an extensive article study was conducted. Then, the validity and reliability of the research tool were confirmed. Results of this study led to develop a valid and reliable tool entitled: “Risk factors assessment tool for the <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> cytological changes towards cervical cancer”. It has 50 items in three parts including demographic characteristic, health history and clinical manifestations. As the risk factors assessment tool for the <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> cytological changes towards cervical cancer is valid and reliable, we strongly recommend applying this tool in facing with the patients in all clinics that are open to women about gynecological problems. It can help the professionals to have a suitable and quick action especially in those areas with limited access to the specialists.

40|$|Although Southeast Asian {{women are}} at {{exceedingly}} {{high risk for}} cervical cancer, low rates of the <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> necessary for early detection and successful treatment continue among this group. Previous research suggests that discussions about <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> with important people in a woman's life, particularly her doctor, may {{increase the likelihood of}} screening; therefore increasing women's discussions about cancer screenings is an important step toward behavior change. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effectiveness of a culturally sensitive, seven-minute video intervention in reducing barriers to discussions about <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> among Thai women. This unique video presented Thai actors, speaking in Thai, in a soap opera format. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire at baseline, immediately after the intervention and at 3 -month follow-up. The comparison group received an educational pamphlet. Although the results indicated that both groups experienced reductions in barriers to communicating with others about <b>Pap</b> <b>tests,</b> the intervention group had significantly stronger outcomes than the comparison group for communicating about <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> in general as well as to doctors. These findings suggest that intermediate communication effects such as self-efficacy, collective efficacy and perhaps interpersonal communication may reduce barriers to discussion and positive decision making regarding <b>Pap</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: The Papanicolaou (<b>Pap)</b> <b>test</b> {{has been}} shown to be {{effective}} in preventing cervical cancer. However, both the national and international literature shows that <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> has not reached the level of coverage desired. The objective of this study was to assess women's knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding the <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> and to investigate whether there are any associations between these three factors and the women's sociodemographic characteristics. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional descriptive study conducted in Floriano, Piau&# 237;. METHODS : The study was conducted among 493 women between November 2009 and December 2010. A questionnaire with precoded questions was sed, and the responses were analyzed in terms of appropriateness in relation to the <b>Pap</b> <b>test.</b> RESULTS : The degrees of adequacy of knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding the <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> were 36. 7 %, 67. 2 % and 69. 6 %, respectively. Among the main barriers against testing, absence of symptoms and a sense of embarrassment were the most notable. CONCLUSIONS: Women who visit doctors periodically had the most appropriate practices regarding the <b>Pap</b> <b>test,</b> but their knowledge of the procedure was poor. This suggests that these women were not receiving adequate information about the benefits of periodic testing...|$|R
40|$|Background: Not much {{is known}} about whether women who follow <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> {{recommendations}} report {{the same pattern of}} sexual behavior as women who do not. Methods: Data come from part of a larger population-based computer-assisted telephone survey of 8656 Australians aged 16 – 64 years resident in Australian households with a fixed telephone line (Australian Longitudinal Study of Health and Relationships [ALSHR]). The main outcome measure in the current study was having had a <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> in the past 2 years. Results: Data on a weighted sample of 4052 women who reported sexual experience (ever had vaginal intercourse) were analyzed. Overall, 73 % of women in the sample reported having a <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> in the past 2 years. Variables individually associated with <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> behavior included age, education, occupation, cohabitation status, residential location, tobacco and alcohol use, body mass index (BMI), lifetime and recent number of opposite sex partners, sexually transmitted infection (STI) history, and condom reliance for contraception. In adjusted analyses, women in their 30 s, those who lived with their partner, and nonsmokers {{were more likely to have}} had a recent <b>Pap</b> <b>test.</b> Those who drank alcohol at least weekly were more likely to have had a recent test than irregular drinkers or nondrinkers. Women with no sexual partners in the last year were less likely to have had a <b>Pap</b> <b>test,</b> and women who reported a previous STI diagnosis were more likely to have had a <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> in the past 2 years. Conclusions: There are differences in <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> behavior among Australian women related to factors that may affect their risk of developing cervical abnormalities. Younger women and regular smokers were less likely to report a recent test. Screening programs should consider the need to focus recruitment strategies for these women. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Rare {{entities}} in the <b>Pap</b> <b>test,</b> {{which include}} neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions, pose challenges {{due to the}} infrequent occurrence {{of many of these}} entities in the daily practice of cytology. Furthermore, these conditions give rise to important diagnostic pitfalls to be aware of in the <b>Pap</b> <b>test.</b> For example, cases with adenoma malignum (AM) have been called benign. Recognition of these conditions can help correctly interpret <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> as abnormal and thereby ensure that patients get appropriately diagnosed. In this paper, we illustrate and discuss selected uncommon primary neoplastic lesions of the cervix and the vagina that may be seen in <b>Pap</b> <b>test,</b> with a focus on cytomorphology, differential diagnosis and the role of possible ancillary studies. These cases include high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cells with small cell morphology; small cell carcinoma; large neuroendocrine carcinoma; glassy cell carcinoma; AM; malignant mixed Müllerian tumor; clear cell carcinoma and primary malignant melanoma. Recognition of these rare variants/neoplasms is important so that involved <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> are not diagnosed as benign and that patients with these conditions get additional follow-up...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} is to provide a profile of {{cervical}} cancer screening practices among the women in Patras and to assess factors associated with cervical cancer screening uptake. Data from a representative sample of 873 women were analyzed. 67. 2 % had at least one <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> in their life, with 54. 4 % having been tested in the previous three years. Women aged 35 - 44 and 45 - 54 years were more likely to have had a recent <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> (OR> 3) as well as married/partnered women (OR= 2. 4). Unemployed women and women with the lowest educational level were less likely to have had a recent <b>Pap</b> <b>test.</b> Compared to women with a monthly household income of < 500 €, those with higher income were more likely to have had a <b>Pap</b> <b>test.</b> The prevalence of <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> in Patras is very low. Our findings support the necessity of implementation of national screening programs or targeted screening interventions mainly in the identified under-screened population subgroups, i. e. women with socioeconomic disadvantages...|$|R
