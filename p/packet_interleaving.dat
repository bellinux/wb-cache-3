This paper proposes a simple <b>packet</b> <b>interleaving</b> scheme to combat the effect of bursty losses by dispersing them. The optimal interleaver for minimizing the expected total distortion of the decoded video, subject to a delay constraint, is determined using a model that accurately predicts the expected distortion for different packet loss patterns. Compared to other forms of error-resilience, <b>packet</b> <b>interleaving</b> has the advantages of (1) simplicity and (2) not requiring any extra bitrate.

In this paper we tackle the problem of how to apply such a transmission schema in real scenarios.

We then present the design and prototype implementation of a packet interleaver, which can be used both for a specific traffic source (e. g. besides a video server) or a particular network path (e. g. before a wireless link). We describe our design choices and the main issues we had to solve during the implementation. Using the prototype we then perform an experimental measurement campaign in order to understand the pros and cons of <b>packet</b> <b>interleaving</b> in real networks.

50|$|RTMP is a TCP-based {{protocol}} which maintains persistent {{connections and}} allows low-latency communication. To deliver streams smoothly and transmit {{as much information}} as possible, it splits streams into fragments, and their size is negotiated dynamically between the client and server. Sometimes, it is kept unchanged; the default fragment sizes are 64 bytes for audio data, and 128 bytes for video data and most other data types. Fragments from different streams may then be interleaved, and multiplexed over a single connection. With longer data chunks, the protocol thus carries only a one-byte header per fragment, so incurring very little overhead. However, in practice, individual fragments are not typically interleaved. Instead, the interleaving and multiplexing is done at the packet level, with RTMP packets across several different active channels being interleaved {{in such a way as}} to ensure that each channel meets its bandwidth, latency, and other quality-of-service requirements. <b>Packets</b> <b>interleaved</b> in this fashion are treated as indivisible, and are not interleaved on the fragment level.|$|R
