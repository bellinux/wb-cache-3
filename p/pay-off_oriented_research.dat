40|$|For {{conducting}} practice <b>oriented</b> <b>research</b> different research {{strategies are}} available. In this paper a typology is developed for differentiating between practice <b>oriented</b> <b>research</b> {{strategies that are}} data based and participatory research strategies. The former category involves quantitative and qualitative data based research strategies. The latter category, participatory research strategies, includes knowledge based research and practice based research. At present, methodological criteria for assessing the quality of practice <b>oriented</b> <b>research</b> heavily rely on those developed for theory <b>oriented</b> <b>research,</b> in particular internal and external validity and reliability. However, we argue that for assessing the results of practice <b>oriented</b> <b>research</b> other criteria are necessary. In this paper, methodological criteria are formulated for evaluating the internal validity and practical utility of practice <b>oriented</b> <b>research</b> {{with the help of}} a Delphi study using research methodologists as experts. They agree upon the criteria of verifiability, comprehensibility and acceptance of the results, as well as holism. Moreover, different categories of participatory and data based research strategies are compared to these criteria. Practice based research and qualitative data based research are best equipped to fulfill these criteria. These findings may enable researchers to make a more deliberate choice for a specific research strategy in practice <b>oriented</b> <b>research...</b>|$|R

On the basis of an analysis of the demands made of industrially <b>oriented</b> <b>research</b> and development, as well as analyses of domestic and foreign experiences to date with the evaluation of such organisations, the authors propose success criteria and performance indicators for evaluating these institutions. The concept claims to make a general methodological contribution to the debate about the evaluation of institutional promotion.

The ‘‘success’’ of online journalism is often measured by {{the extent to which it}} utilizes technological assets like interactivity, multimedia and hypertext. This paper critically examines the technologically <b>oriented</b> <b>research</b> about online journalism in the second decade of its existence. The aim is twofold. First, to investigate to what degree online journalism, as it is portrayed in empirical research, utilizes new technology more than previously. Second, the paper points to the limitations of technologically <b>oriented</b> <b>research</b> and suggests alternative research approaches that might be more effective in explaining why online journalism develops as it does...|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} of the practice-oriented research strategy is to develop knowledge about the improvement of practices. Practice <b>oriented</b> <b>research</b> is research in which the research goal {{is coming from the}} professional practice and in which the knowledge created in the research contributes directly to this professional practice. The problem does not originate in theory, and the knowledge created in the research is not valued because it contributes to theory. It is not knowledge-for-its-own-sake, but the knowledge is valued because it contributes to the improvement of the practice which is considered (by ministers and lay people) to be a problem. Practice-orientated research is especially relevant to congregational studies because the congregational ministry is conducted within a specific context that is challenging it to be relevant. The major steps or questions in developing a research design of practice <b>oriented</b> <b>research</b> is: what is the problem you are going to study? Why is it interesting to get this new knowledge and for whom is it interesting? How are you going to reach your research objective? How much do you want to know? And what are the conceptual instruments which you are going to use in your research? In following these steps the specific research orientation of practice <b>oriented</b> <b>research</b> is introduced...|$|R
