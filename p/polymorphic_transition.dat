Lipid nanosuspensions with small particles and narrow particle size distributions are preferably obtained by emulsification of the molten matrix lipid {{in a hot}} aqueous phase with adequate stabilizers and subsequent crystallization of the dispersed lipid matrix. A variety of different emulsifiers {{has been used for}} the preparation of solid lipid nanoparticle dispersions, including phospholipids, bile salts, poloxamers and other ionic and nonionic surfactants.

Upon storage at common temperatures after preparation solid nanoparticles are formed in tristearin and tripalmitin dispersions. In contrast to literature reports, colloidal dispersions of trilaurin do not form solid particles under those conditions. They should, therefore, {{be regarded as}} emulsions of supercooled melts rather than as nanosuspensions. Trimyristin nanoparticles which can be obtained in solid or liquid form have a larger incorporation capacity for the lipophilic model drug menadione in the liquid than in the solid state. The kinetics of <b>polymorphic</b> <b>transitions</b> after crystallization of triglyceride nanoparticles are slower for longer-chain than for shorter-chain triglycerides. Addition of tristearin raises the crystallization temperature of colloidally dispersed trimyristin and trilaurin facilitating solidification during production. The structure and melting behavior of the resulting mixed nanoparticles are more complex than those of nanoparticles prepared from the simple triglycerides.

At 18 °C, lard crystallized in three steps. A potential mechanism for these three steps was proposed. In the first step, part of the melt (the trisaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs)) crystallized in α crystals adopting a double length structure (2 L), while the second step consisted of a <b>polymorphic</b> <b>transition</b> of these 2 Lα crystals to β’ crystals with a triple length structure (3 L). Extra 3 Lβ’ crystals consisting of monounsaturated TAGs were also formed directly from the melt. In the third and last step, β crystals were formed due to a second <b>polymorphic</b> <b>transition</b> of trisaturated 3 Lβ’ crystals to β crystals adopting a 2 L structure. Above a cut-off temperature of 20 °C lard crystallized in two steps: no formation of α crystals could be observed and 3 Lβ’ crystals (trisaturated and monounsaturated TAGs) were formed directly from the melt. This proposed mechanism implies that lard crystallization is characterized by an overlap of fractionated crystallization and polymorphic transitions. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Milling {{processes}} {{are known to}} cause <b>polymorphic</b> <b>transition</b> in enantiotropic systems and the micronization process employed to produce microparticles for inhalation formulations {{has been reported to}} result in solid-state damage. The aim of the current work was to investigate the polymorphism of salmeterol xinafoate (SX) following antisolvent micronization from poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) solvents and compare this to the properties of SX conventionally crystallized and micronized. Powder X-ray diffraction revealed that SX crystallized predominantly as the SX form I polymorph following rapid precipitation from PEG solvents and cooling crystallization from propan- 2 -ol. Thermo-kinetic analysis using a modified Avrami-Erofe'ev equation was applied to differential scanning calorimetric thermographs of crystallized and micronized SX. The kinetic analysis revealed that SX crystallized from PEG solvents underwent significantly less or no re-crystallization of SX form II from the melt. A <b>polymorphic</b> <b>transition</b> was identified upon heating ball-milled SX, although the untreated material was resistant to such transformation. The thermal behaviour of SX crystallized from PEG solvents was consistent with a lower degree of crystal lattice disorder and higher enantiotropic purity than SX crystallized from propan- 2 -ol; the same was also true when comparing SX before and after micronization.

Here, by contrast, we explore the effect of surface immobilization in a direct solid state <b>polymorphic</b> <b>transition</b> on individual cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), extracted from a plant-based origin. The conversion from native cellulose I to cellulose III crystal occurred via a host-guest inclusion of ethylene diamine inside the crystal. 60 % reduction in CNC width (height) in atomic force microscopy images suggested that when immobilized on a flat modified silica surface, the stresses caused by the inclusion or the subsequent regeneration resulted in exfoliation, hypothetically between the van der Waals bonded sheets within the crystal.

Raman spectroscopy, with its {{high degree of}} informational content, remote sampling capability and simplicity, {{promises to be a}} good candidate for the understanding of pharmaceutical processes and quality monitoring. In results presented here, Raman spectroscopy was used as a new technique to determine tablet content uniformity (CU), coating thickness and crystallization and <b>polymorphic</b> <b>transitions</b> of mannitol during freeze-drying. In the CU study, a low resolution Raman spectrometer was utilized for rapid on-line determination of acetaminophen content in a small batch of tablets.

The low resolution Raman spectrometer instrument was also utilized {{in the development of a}} multivariate calibration curve aimed to determine tablet-coating thickness. To avoid sub-sampling issues due to sample inhomogeneity, this Raman system employs a revolving focus, which increases the sampled volume. Non-invasive monitoring of mannitol crystallization and <b>polymorphic</b> <b>transitions</b> during freeze-drying was achieved by coupling a long working distance high-resolution Raman spectrometer to a freeze-drier. This high-resolution system offers a beam size diameter of 6 mm, which allows sampling a surface area 1600 times larger than conventional probes.

However, the oleogels are prone to undergo <b>polymorphic</b> <b>transition</b> over time that lead to crystals' aggregation thus, compromises physical properties. Thus, we combined MGs with PS to control the crystallization and modify the morphology of the combination oleogels, as both components are reported to interact together. The oleogels were prepared at different ratio combinations and characterized in their rheological, thermal, morphology, and diffraction properties. The {{results showed that the}} 8 : 2 MGP:PS exhibited higher storage modulus (G′) than the MGP mono-component. The combination oleogels exhibited effects on the crystallization and <b>polymorphic</b> <b>transition.</b> Consequently, the effects led to change in the morphology of the combination oleogels which was visualized using optical and electron microscope. The resultant effect on the morphology is associated with crystal defect. Due to observable crystals of MGP and PS, it is speculated that the combination oleogels formed a mixed crystal system. This was confirmed with diffraction analysis in which the corresponding peaks from MGP and PS were observed in the combination oleogels. However, the 8 : 2 oleogel exhibited additional peak at 35. 41 Å. Ultimately, the 8 : 2 was the optimum combination observed in our study. Interestingly, this combination is inspired by nature as sterols (phytosterols) are natural component of lipid membrane whilst MGP has properties similar to phospholipids.
