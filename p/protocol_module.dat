50|$|The Windows Sockets API {{specification}} defines two interfaces: the API used by application developers, and the SPI, {{which provides}} a means for network software developers to add new protocol modules to the system.

The SPI contract guarantees that a conforming <b>protocol</b> <b>module</b> may be added to Windows and will thereby be usable by an API-compliant application. Although these contracts were important when Windows Sockets was first released, since network environments required multi-protocol support (see above) they are now of only academic interest.

40|$|Abstract — Link {{reversal}} routing (LRR) is a local, distributed, and low-overhead {{technique used}} to maintain loop free routes in mobile wireless ad hoc networks. We explore {{the problem of}} load balancing the packet traffic in the network when using the LRR created routes. We study a fundamental LRR algorithm and identify usual situations which cause the load to be unbalanced. We propose two modifications to the LRR algorithm such that the load is distributed in a more uniform manner. The modifications preserve all the desirable qualities of LRR algorithms such as loop free routes, local response to topology change and are completely distributed in nature. In order to evaluate {{the performance of the}} proposed mechanisms we augment the TORA, a LRR based routing <b>protocol,</b> <b>module</b> of NS- 2.

40|$|Multichannel local-area {{networks}} can {{be constructed}} using fiber-optic wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) techniques. In this paper, WDM is applied to ring networks such as FDDI, token ring, slotted ring, and buffer insertion ring architectures. Crosstalk and insertion loss analyses of grating demultiplexers shows that the ratio of channel separation to channel width must be greater than four. Performance analyses of the multichannel WDM ring are formulated to determine the packet delay. The delay in the multichannel token ring is obtained by summing the remaining service time, token walk time, and the average service time of newly arrived messages. The remaining service time is estimated by approximating {{the system as a}} M/M/m queue. The multichannel slotted ring and buffer insertion ring are modeled by a non-preemptive head-of-the-line priority queuing system. By identifying that portion of the passing ring traffic having priority over local traffic, the delay of a tagged packet can be obtained as the sum of the residual service time and service times of local waiting packets and newly arrived ring packets.

Energy Conservation in IEEE 802. 15. 4 nodes is always {{a concern for the}} designers as the life time of a network depends mainly on minimizing the energy consumption in the nodes. In ZigBee cluster-tree network, the existing literature does not provide combined solution for co-channel interference and power efficient scheduling. In addition, the technique that prevents network collision has not been provided. Delay and reliability issues are not addressed in the QoS-aware routing. Congestion {{is one of the major}} challenges in IEEE 802. 15. 4 Network. This network also has issues in admitting real time flows. The aim of the present research is to overcome the issues mentioned above by designing Energy Efficient Cluster Scheduling and Interference Mitigation, QoS Aware Inter-Cluster Routing Protocol and Adaptive Data Rate Control for Clustered Architecture for IEEE 802. 15. 4 Networks. To overcome the issue of Energy efficiency and network collision energy efficient cluster scheduling and interference mitigation for IEEE 802. 15. 4 Network is proposed. It uses a time division cluster scheduling technique that offers energy efficiency in the cluster-tree network. In addition, an interference mitigation technique is demonstrated which detects and mitigates the channel interference based on packet-error detection and repeated channel-handoff command transmission. For the issues of delay and reliability in cluster network, QoS aware intercluster routing protocol for IEEE 802. 15. 4 Networks is proposed. It consists of some modules like reliability module, packet classifier, hello <b>protocol</b> <b>module,</b> routing service module. Using the Packet classifier, the packets are classified into the data and hello packets. The data packets are classified based on the priority. Neighbour table is constructed to maintain the information of neighbour nodes reliabilities by Hello <b>protocol</b> <b>module.</b> Moreover, routing table is built using the routing service module.

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{vulnerabilities}} occur because pro-tocol implementations failed to anticipate illegal pack-ets. rfcs typically define what constitute “right ” pack-ets relevant to the protocol and they specify what the response should be for such packets. They are often ambiguous and remain silent on what the protocol im-plementation should do for packets which deviate from the specification. Implementers must and, by and large, do faithfully implement an rfc. However, implementers usually take any silence in a specification as “design freedom”.

We offer advice to rfc writers, imple-menters and rfc approval bodies. The most effective solution to reducing network security incidents is to fix the rfcs {{in such a way that}} the implementers are forced to write an exploit-robust implementation, irrespective of their security knowledge and expertise. ...|$|E

These wireless infrastructural technologies have been designed in such a manner as to enable them to be self-organised, self-configured, reliable and robust, with a capacity to sustain high traffic volumes and long “online ” time. However, the desired networking and complex features have resulted in unnecessary network energy consumption, impacting negatively on the economy, environment and the ICT markets. In order to reduce the potential energy consumption in these networks, this chapter proposes a novel energy management scheme based on behavioural ecology. Inspired by the applied foraging theory, whereby a solitary forager in a random ecosystem makes optimal decisions that maximises its energy (nutrients) consumption, survival probability and lifetime, a Foraging-Inspired Radio-Communication Energy Management (FIREMAN) method has been developed. The FIREMAN method, consisting of optimal transmission energy allocation and energy saving efforts in multi-radio networks, has as its aim, the achievement of both optimal network energy consumption and lifetime. To attain a scalable solution, the FIREMAN method has been coordinated by a radio resource allocation <b>protocol</b> <b>module</b> built on the link layer of the networking protocol stack.
