50|$|Gold {{extraction}} {{refers to}} the processes required to extract gold from its ores. This may require a combination of comminution, mineral processing, hydrometallurgical, and <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>processes</b> to be performed on the ore.|$|R
50|$|This {{process was}} {{developed}} by the St. Joseph Mineral Company in 1930, and is the only <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>process</b> still used in the US to smelt zinc. The advantage of this system is that it is able to smelt a wide variety of zinc-bearing materials, including electric arc furnace dust. The disadvantage of this process is that it is less efficient than the electrolysis process.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} several pyrometallurgical {{processes}} that reduce zinc oxide using carbon, then distil the metallic zinc from the resulting mix {{in an atmosphere}} of carbon monoxide. The major downfall of any of the <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>process</b> is that it is only 98% pure; a standard composition is 1.3% lead, 0.2% cadmium, 0.03% iron, and 98.5% zinc. This may be pure enough for galvanization, but not enough for die casting alloys, which requires special high-grade zinc (99.995% pure). In order to reach this purity the zinc must be refined.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the {{extractive}} metallurgy of gold ores the cyanidation and melting processes are generally applied. These processes allow obtaining the “dore”. The slag generated during the melting process presents various characteristics, {{depending on the}} mineral source {{and the type of}} flux used. The literature information on this <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>process</b> at high temperature is very poor. For this reason this paper is focused on the characterization of three synthetic slags. The main objective of the study is to characterize the slags: a) improve the melting process operation, b) to analyze the environmental impact, c) to determine the possibility of slags being recycled...|$|E

40|$|In many <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>processes</b> pellets or {{briquettes}} of {{raw materials}} (typically a mix of metal oxide and carbon) are immersed in a hot liquid bath. Heat is transferred to the pellets reducing the metal oxide and forming by products such as gases, metal and slag. This is a complex multi-phase flow with coupled heat transfer and chemical reactions. For many <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>processes</b> traditional grid based computational methods, such as the Finite Element Method (FEM) and Finite Volume (or Control Volume methods), produce suitable predictions.

The aim of obtained model was to develop a prediction tool that will be used to calculate potential SO 2 concentration, above prescribed limitation, based on input parameters. As predictors, both technogenic and meteorological input parameters were considered.

The present work deals with the character and morphology of the input material {{for the production of}} ZnO by the indirect <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>process.</b> Undesirable phases in the feedstock can be identified through profound recognition of the source material and the nature of its microstructure. If these compounds diffuse into the lining during thermal processes, they become the cause of stress in metallurgical ceramics. The emergence of these chemical reactions may subsequently affect the entire metallurgical zinc smelting process. The results obtained by analysis are used to minimize waste - zinc slag and to eliminate the conditions which enable the formation of the undesired product, thereby increasing the productivity of the ZnO production...|$|E
5000|$|Pyrometallurgy {{involves}} {{high temperature}} processes where chemical reactions take place among gases, solids, and molten materials. Solids containing valuable metals are treated to form intermediate compounds for further processing or converted into their elemental or metallic state. <b>Pyrometallurgical</b> <b>processes</b> that involve gases and solids are typified by calcining and roasting operations. Processes that produce molten products are collectively {{referred to as}} smelting operations. The energy required to sustain the high temperature <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>processes</b> may derive from the exothermic nature of the chemical reactions taking place. Typically, these reactions are oxidation, e.g. of sulfide to sulfur dioxide [...] Often, however, energy must {{be added to the}} process by combustion of fuel or, in the case of some smelting processes, by the direct application of electrical energy.|$|R
50|$|Zinc {{refining}} is {{the process}} of purifying zinc to super high grade (SHG) zinc, which is at least 99.995% pure. This process is not usually required when smelting of zinc is done through electrolysis processes, but is needed when zinc is produced by <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>processes,</b> because it is only 98.5% pure.|$|R
50|$|Nickel-cobalt {{lateritic}} ores can {{be treated}} by either hydrometallurgical <b>processes</b> or <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>processes,</b> such as matte or ferronickel smelting, which require the entire ore to be melted and the metal values {{to be separated from}} the residual components of the ore.

40|$|The exergy {{content of}} a process stream is a {{thermodynamic}} quantity, indicating {{the maximum amount of}} work the stream can perform in a reference environment. It can be calculated for energy streams as well as for mass streams, allowing an unambiguous comparison between the two. Starting from an exergy balance the global efficiency of any thermodynamic process can be quantified by comparing the exergy in the useful output streams to the exergy provided by the input streams. This is an advantage over traditional process analyses based on separate mass and energy balances. From an ecological and economical point of view, exergy analysis thus provides a powerful tool for the evaluation and optimization of industrial processes. In this article the thermodynamic principles behind an exergy analysis are first elaborated. Next, it is illustrated that the outcome of an exergy calculation can be substantially influenced by the choice of a reference state, a thermodynamic database and a description method for the stream. The latter is of particular importance for <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>process</b> streams with complex compositions and phase structures. Due to these effects, comparisons between different exergy analyses should be ap-proached with care. However, when the analyses are performed systematically and consistently, they can be very useful for the optimization of process efficiencies. This is shown in the last part of this article, in which a case study on a recently developed zinc recycling process is discussed. For the first time, well adapted solution models are used for an accurate and consistent description of the involved <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>process</b> streams. An analysis of a base case scenario shows that the process efficiency is limited by the production of low exergetic zinc oxide and high exergetic waste streams. Based on this outcome, appropriate modifications are suggested to improve the overall process efficiency. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{commercial}} <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>process</b> for {{the extraction}} of platinum-group metals (PGM) from a feedstock slag was analysed {{with the use of}} a model based on computational fluid dynamics. The results of the modelling indicate that recovery depends on the behaviour of the collector phase. A possible method is proposed for estimation of the rate at which PGM particles in slag are absorbed into an iron collector droplet that falls through it. Nanoscale modelling techniques (for particle migration or capture) are combined with a diffusion-controlled mass-transfer model to determine the iron collector droplet size needed for > 95 % PGM recovery in a typical process bath (70 mm deep) in a realistic time-scale (90 %) within a reasonable time. This finding is compatible with published experimental data. Pyrometallurgical processes similar to that investigated should be applicable to other types of waste that contain low levels of potentially valuable metals...|$|E
40|$|A <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>process</b> {{has been}} {{modelled}} and conceptually {{designed for the}} thermal treatment of heavy metal containing waste streams like MSW incinerator fly ash and sewage sludge. The modelling is carried out using the computer program EQUIMET as developed by Billiton Research BV. This program calculates thermodynamic equilibrium, making use of a slag model {{to account for the}} non-ideality of the slag phase. By comparison with a pilot test on smelting of MSW incinerator fly ash it is shown that thermodynamic modelling reasonably describes the waste smelting process and especially the fate of the minor elements. The thermodynamic model has been incorporated into a flow sheeting program, which calculates energy and mass balances for the proposed process configuration.

40|$|In several <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>processes,</b> {{reactive}} pellets {{are added}} to a melt.

For many <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>processes</b> traditional grid based CFD methods, such as using the Finite Element Method (FEM) and Finite Volume (or Control Volume methods), produce suitable predictions. However, the inclusion of solids in the bath represents significant challenges for these methods. Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), a Lagrangian simulation method, is able to simulate both the fluid component of the bath and any immersed solid materials, tracking the motion of these solids, and their interaction with the fluid, including gas generation.

40|$|Ways of {{increasing}} productivity have been always a challenging issue for <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>processes.</b> Increasing the throughput of the reactor through higher temperature and vigorous agitation in bath are possible options for enhancing the kinetics of reactions in the multiphase system processes. On the other hand, these measures {{also lead to}} rapid degradation of the refractory and premature shutdown of the reactor for relining, imposing additional costs on processes {{in the form of}} planned and unplanned maintenance. An alternative solution to this problem is the formation of a slag freeze lining rather than direct contact of refractory layers with the hot bath. Slag freeze-linings are increasingly used in industrial <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>processes</b> to ensure furnace integrity is maintained in aggressive high temperature environments. Most previous studies of freeze-linings have analysed the formation of slag deposits based solely on heat transfer models.

In the present work, the effect of slag basicity on melting features and viscosity of the slag was investigated. The basicity of the SiO 2 -CaO-MgO-Al 2 O 3 -FeO quinary slag system varied from 0. 76 to 0. 99. The results showed that: 1) all the slag samples began to soften at the same temperature; 2) the softening temperature, melting temperature and flowing temperature decreased with the increase of basicity from 0. 76 to 0. 92, after that, the temperatures would increase sharply. 3) the inflection point temperature of viscosity-temperature curve became larger and larger with the increase of basicity within 0. 76 ~ 0. 99...|$|E

At present, technologies available for spent LIBs recycling include chemical deposition, solvent extraction, Etoile-Rebatt process, electrodeposition, floatation and ion-exchanging. In this paper, a novel vacuum-aided pyro-metallurgical process for recovery metallic Co directly from waste LIBs was presented.
