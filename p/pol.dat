5|$|A bypass {{platform}} is provided to these polymerases by Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Under normal circumstances, PCNA bound to polymerases replicates the DNA. At {{a site of}} lesion, PCNA is ubiquitinated, or modified, by the RAD6/RAD18 proteins to provide a platform for the specialized polymerases to bypass the lesion and resume DNA replication. After translesion synthesis, extension is required. This extension {{can be carried out}} by a replicative polymerase if the TLS is error-free, {{as in the case of}} <b>Pol</b> η, yet if TLS results in a mismatch, a specialized polymerase is needed to extend it; <b>Pol</b> ζ. <b>Pol</b> ζ is unique in that it can extend terminal mismatches, whereas more processive polymerases cannot. So when a lesion is encountered, the replication fork will stall, PCNA will switch from a processive polymerase to a TLS polymerase such as <b>Pol</b> ι to fix the lesion, then PCNA may switch to <b>Pol</b> ζ to extend the mismatch, and last PCNA will switch to the processive polymerase to continue replication.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the <b>poling</b> {{process of}} PZT ceramics, the <b>poling</b> {{temperature}} {{is a critical}} condition. When the <b>poling</b> temperature is too low, no matter how high is the <b>poling</b> field and how long is the <b>poling</b> time, the planar electromechanical coupling factor kp is lower. When the <b>poling</b> temperature is higher enough, the kp can reach to a saturated value with a lower <b>poling</b> field and short <b>poling</b> time. The variation of dielectric constant with the <b>poling</b> conditions {{is the same as}} that of planar electromechanical coupling factor. When <b>poling</b> with a low temperature, the dielectric constant after <b>poling</b> is lower than 1400.

40|$|The {{effect of}} two <b>poling</b> {{processes}} on the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of sol–gel and pulsedlaser-deposited Pb(Zr 0. 45 Ti 0. 55) O 3 (PZT) thin films {{has been investigated}} {{as a function of}} the <b>poling</b> field, <b>poling</b> temperature and <b>poling</b> time.

The room-temperature <b>poling</b> process using ac electric field <b>poling,</b> shows the same trend with <b>poling</b> field but much shorter <b>poling</b> times (100 seconds), with only a slightly lower saturation value of polarization. It is suggested that in room-temperature <b>poling</b> screening charges are merely rearranged, whereas in high temperature <b>poling</b> these charges are largely removed.

5|$|Translesion {{synthesis}} (TLS) is a DNA {{damage tolerance}} process {{that allows the}} DNA replication machinery to replicate past DNA lesions such as thymine dimers or AP sites. It involves switching out regular DNA polymerases for specialized translesion polymerases (i.e. DNA polymerase IV or V, from the Y Polymerase family), often with larger active sites that can facilitate the insertion of bases opposite damaged nucleotides. The polymerase switching {{is thought to be}} mediated by, among other factors, the post-translational modification of the replication processivity factor PCNA. Translesion synthesis polymerases often have low fidelity (high propensity to insert wrong bases) on undamaged templates relative to regular polymerases. However, many are extremely efficient at inserting correct bases opposite specific types of damage. For example, <b>Pol</b> η mediates error-free bypass of lesions induced by UV irradiation, whereas <b>Pol</b> ι introduces mutations at these sites. <b>Pol</b> η is known to add the first adenine across the T^T photodimer using Watson-Crick base pairing and the second adenine will be added in its syn conformation using Hoogsteen base pairing. From a cellular perspective, risking the introduction of point mutations during translesion synthesis may be preferable to resorting to more drastic mechanisms of DNA repair, which may cause gross chromosomal aberrations or cell death. In short, the process involves specialized polymerases either bypassing or repairing lesions at locations of stalled DNA replication. For example, Human DNA polymerase eta can bypass complex DNA lesions like guanine-thymine intra-strand crosslink, GT, although can cause targeted and semi-targeted mutations. Paromita Raychaudhury and Ashis Basu studied the toxicity and mutagenesis of the same lesion in Escherichia coli by replicating a GT-modified plasmid in E. coli with specific DNA polymerase knockouts. Viability was very low in a strain lacking <b>pol</b> II, <b>pol</b> IV, and <b>pol</b> V, the three SOS-inducible DNA polymerases, indicating that translesion synthesis is conducted primarily by these specialized DNA polymerases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Lead {{zirconate}} titanate (PZT) -Portland cement (PC) composites {{were produced}} and successfully <b>poled</b> at different <b>poling</b> field and time. The effect of polarization on the microstructure and piezoelectric properties were then investigated. It was found that, {{at a fixed}} <b>poling</b> field up to 2 kV/mm, the piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) was found to increase with <b>poling</b> time. The optimum <b>poling</b> time was found at 45 minutes where d 33 value is 42 pC/N. The optimum and most practical <b>poling</b> field found for the composite was at 2 kV/mm. Lower <b>poling</b> field would give the composite lower piezoelectricity and <b>poling</b> field that is too high would result to breakdown of samples. Therefore, from these results, a <b>poling</b> field of 2 kV/mm at 45 minutes would be the ideal polarization condition used in <b>poling</b> PZT-PC composites...|$|R

40|$|This Thesis {{reports a}} {{theoretical}} and {{experimental study of}} thermal <b>poling</b> of glasses in which a second order optical nonlinearity is introduced into the glass by applying a potential across the glass at elevated temperature. Thermal <b>poling</b> is the most reported and reproducible procedure for {{the introduction of the}} nonlinear susceptibility of 2 nd order, c(2), in glasses. The attainment of c(2) of the order of 1 pm/V has been reported {{in a wide range of}} silica based glasses including glasses suitable for ion exchange, UV-writing and rare earth doping. Effective c(2) of 0. 1 pm/V has been demonstrated in <b>poled</b> channel waveguides in silica indicating a poor overlap between c(2) and the waveguide modes. These reported values of c(2) must be increased at least one order of magnitude for glasses and two orders of magnitude for waveguides for practical use. Therefore a good understanding of the <b>poling</b> mechanism which was unclear at the beginning of this work was required for <b>poling</b> optimisation. In this Thesis a <b>poling</b> model based on electrostatics and ion transport theory is developed yielding a method for the evaluation of glasses for <b>poling.</b> A new technique for simultaneous <b>poling</b> and waveguide fabrication by differential ionic drift in glasses that contains more than one mobile ion is demonstrated and <b>poling</b> of K+ ion-exchanged waveguides is achieved. c(2) of the order of 1 pm/V was verified in <b>poled</b> soda lime glass and in found in <b>poled</b> potassium ion-exchanged soda lime glass.
