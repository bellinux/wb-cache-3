40|$|Abortion is a {{theme that}} is not {{systematically}} discussed in Brazil, which facilitates the occurrence of bias positions. In this article, we {{will focus on the}} <b>provoked</b> <b>abortion,</b> ruling our discussion in moral and ethical aspects involved in the phenomenal. Traversal themes to abortion such as sexuality, specifically the female sexuality and its narrow relationship with procreation, will be reported. Finally, matters related to gender and religion, fundamentally the Christian, will also be discussed. Thus, this work highlights the need for a discussion on abortion, an important theme in the discussions about the woman's health and whose frequency is high in our society...|$|E
40|$|The {{immunological}} {{mechanisms that}} regulate abortion are largely unknown. Here, {{we found that}} a distinct subset of lymphocytes, Vα 14 NKT cells expressing an invariant antigen receptor encoded by Vα 14 /Jα 281 and Vβ 7 segments, accumulated in the decidua during pregnancy and <b>provoked</b> <b>abortion</b> upon stimulation with α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), a specific ligand for Vα 14 NKT cells. The α-GalCer-mediated abortion was not observed in Vα 14 NKT-, IFN-γ-, tumor necrosis factor α-, or perforin-knock-out mice {{and appeared to be}} due to the degeneration of embryonic trophoblasts mediated by the activated Vα 14 NKT cells whose perforin-dependent killing and production of IFN-γ and tumor necrosis factor α were essential. The possible role of the decidual Vα 14 NKT cells in the pathogenesis of abortion is discussed...|$|E

Due to all the implications that this has, it isimportant that professionals that attend sexual and reproductivehealth, have a clear level of theoretical knowledge based on scientific concepts, be convinced of its advantages and have a serious compromise with the society. Because the abortion is not legal in Colombia, even in rape cases, incest, life risk and woman health, and because the <b>provoked</b> <b>abortion</b> and its complications is the third cause of maternal death, all the actions, including emergency contraception, that prevent unwanted pregnancy and abortion have great importance.

In recent years the toxic effects of many medicinal plants on the preimplantational mouse embryo development have been studied. Many of them produce malformations and alterations in the embryonic development. Ruta graveolens "ruda", Origanum vulgare "oregano" and Persea americana "palta" are used in rural areas to menstrual colic and to <b>provoke</b> <b>abortion</b> (estrella, 1995).

40|$|Bovine {{herpesvirus}}es 1 and 4 (BoHV- 1 and BoHV- 4) and caprine herpesvirus (CpHV- 1) {{are responsible}} of abortion. Abortions caused by BoHV- 1 happen during outbreaks of {{infectious bovine rhinotracheitis}} whereas BoHV- 4 is associated with abortion but {{is not a very}} high risk factor. CpHV- 1 infection is not yet identified in Belgium and in France. Bovine and ovine pestiviruses, bovine viral diarrhea and Border disease viruses, respectively, <b>provoke</b> <b>abortions</b> mainly {{during the first half of}} gestation. At the herd level, the prevention of abortion caused by these viruses can be achieved by the control of virus circulation with the help of vaccination or the elimination of persistently infected animals. At the individual level, immunisation with inactivated vaccines induces a high humoral response with high levels of neutralising antibodies, able to prevent the viremia and foetus infection.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{cerebral}} venous and sinus thrombosis (CVST), severe neurological emergencies is {{an important}} pathology of the venous brain system. This paper is an on-going study about CVST, the first report was done in 2008. Material and methodsWe received 32 patients hospitalized on emergency between February 2006 – February 2013 (only self - casuistry). Demographic (sex, age), clinical, imagistic (cerebral MRI – venous angiography, cerebral CT), paraclinic (CSF, factor V Leiden mutation) data, as well as risk factors, treatment, evolution and neurologic recovery were all considered. ResultsWe studied 20 females and 12 males (62 % versus 38 %). Etiology: oral contraceptives (8 cases), otomastoiditis (7 cases), dental abscess of the upper jaw (3 cases), maxilar sinusitis (2 cases), penetrating skull trauma (3 cases), ethmoidal puncture for frontal sinusitis (1 case), <b>provoked</b> <b>abortion</b> (2 cases), pregnancy (1 case), puerperium (1 case), hereditary thrombophilia- factor V Leiden mutation (heterozigot fenotype - 3 cases), encephalitis with HSV (1 case). The symptomatology varied according to the disease etiology {{and the location of}} CVST. Initial clinical symptoms include: coma (3 cases), headache (26 cases), seizures (20 cases), motor and mental disturbances (18 cases), cranial nerves palsy (18 cases), intracranial hypertension (8 cases), papilledema (4 cases), nausea and vomiting (20 cases). Cerebral MRI- venous angiography is the optimum diagnosis method we applied to all patients. ConclusionsCVST even with a reduced occurrence, represents a severe neurovascular emergency. CVST is more common in women, frequently associated with oral contraceptives, abortion, pregnancy or puerperium (37 %). Young patients with CVST should be screened for thrombophilia. If diagnosed at an early stage, especially by cerebral MRI-venous angiography and correctly treated, the patients have a favorable evolution, the lethal cases decreasing until 3 %. Patients with septic CVST and coma from the beginning have bad prognosis. The efficacy of heparin with APTT controlled has been shown...|$|E
40|$|The author {{begins this}} work by making an {{exposition}} of those facts {{which we could}} call fundamental from the biological point of view to understand and judge the different birth control methods in use today. From the very moment of the fertilization of the ovum by the spermatozoid. the development plans of a new organism become imprinted. This new organism is endowed with an extraordinary functional capacity whose determination is unaffected by {{the relations between the}} maternal organism and the fetal organismo These facts are so apparent that. Jf the beginning of Iife is not located in fecundation. there exist no concrete re· ferences as to when it does in fact take place. Abortive birth control methods are those which interrupt embryonic -or fetal- development. no matter the mechanism of action employed nor the time elapsed since the fertilization of the ovum. The spreading of these abortive methods has been noteworthy. with the proliferation of contraceptive methods -mainly the hormonal ones (the «pill [...] ) which have served as the key which has opened the door for abortion. Jt can be demonstrated how in these last fifteen years the relation between contraceptives and abortion is indeed intimate, and it beco mes difficult to separate them in practice. The laws promulgated in a large number of countries in recent years approving abortion have created in the public at large a conceptual confusion which makes that «Iegalized»,. inducedD, «provoked», «criminal» [...] . abortions become differentiated only with sorne difficulty, whereas in point of fact the differences are quite c 1 ear. The only abortion which can be conside'red legal is spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) which occurs independently of the will of the mother and that of the doctor; all other cases deal with <b>provoked</b> <b>abortion</b> and signify the direct death of an individual. Jt is no doubt true that juridical legality do es not necessarily identify itself with ethical norms and that it cannot be the fundament of doctrinal norms of conduct; it is precisely from this that even «Iegalized» abortion continues to be a crime. Finally, the author makes reference to the relations between abortion and euthanasia which are increasing evident as time goes by. It is foreseeable that {{in the next few years}} the first laws allowing euthanasia will be approved, signifying yet a further step in the escalation of the anti-life movement...|$|E
40|$|Trata-se de um estudo de corte transversal, realizado com o objetivo de {{investigar}} as razões que levaram adolescentes a provocarem o aborto, relacionando com idade e tipo de escola que frequentavam. A amostra foi calculada considerando o número de internações para curetagem pós-abortamento. Usou-se como instrumento um questionário semiestruturado, anônimo, aplicado em dez escolas, sorteadas dentre todas da cidade de Maceió (Alagoas), pesquisando-se adolescentes dos 12 aos 19 anos, do sexo feminino. Os dados foram analisados pelo Programa Epi Info, usando-se {{odds ratio}} e risco relativo para verificar associação entre variáveis e intervalo de confiança a 95 %. Em uma amostra de 2. 592 jovens, 559 (21, 6 %) tinham vida sexual ativa, 182 (7, 0 %) referiram ter engravidado e 149 (26, 7 %) abortado. Medo da reação dos pais, idade, falta de apoio do companheiro e rejeição da gravidez foram razões para provocar o aborto, sendo medo a mais citada, em ambos os tipos de escola. O aborto foi mais citado nas escolas públicas, sendo significativo e protetor o risco para abortar antes dos 15 anos, e significativa a relação entre abortar e estudar em escolas públicas. O medo da reação dos pais como razão mais frequente sugere a necessidade de novos estudos sobre sexualidade e comunicação entre pais e filhos. This is a cross-cut study that {{was carried out}} {{with the objective of}} investigating the causes through which adolescents have <b>provoked</b> <b>abortion,</b> relating it to age and the type of school attended. The sample was calculated by taking into account the number of hospital admissions for post-abortion curettage. A semi-structured and anonymous questionnaire was used as a research instrument which was applied in ten schools randomly chosen among all schools, of Maceió (Alagoas, Brazil), to reach 12 - 19 years old female teenagers. The data were assessed by the Epi Info Program making use of odds ratio and a relative risk to verify any association among variables and a confidence interval at 95 %. At a sample of 2, 592 adolescents, 559 (21. 6 %) had an active sexual life, 182 (7. 0 %) informed to have been pregnant and 149 (26. 7 %) to have aborted. The fear of the parents' reaction, age, lack of support of the partner and pregnancy rejection were the explanation to stimulate abortion. Fear was the most mentioned cause in both types of school. Abortion was more mentioned in public schools, being significant and protective the risk of aborting before the age of 15. The fear of the parents' reaction as a frequent cause suggests the necessity for additional studies on sexuality and communication between parents and children...|$|E
40|$|A mean {{incidence}} of abortion in the State of Ceara-Sobral was 29 percent. A total of 59 goats {{in the first}} 50 days pregnancy among 206 pregnant does reared in the State of Ceara-Sobral (North Eastern Brazil), giving a mean {{incidence of}} 29 percent. Primarily, we thought that this high incidence of abortions was of infectious origin. However, microbacteriological culture, histological and serological examinations of placenta, fetus and maternal blood samples were negative in all prospected areas. Later on, maternal blood samples were examined for their concentration in some elements. The results showed very low levels of Iodine (1. 6 - 4. 0 mcg/dl.), Magnesium (0. 1 mcg/ml), Manganese (0. 6 - 1. 51 mg percent) and Phosphorus (2. 56 - 5. 88 mg percent). The low levels of these elements in the maternal blood corresponded {{with low levels of}} the same elements in the normal diet of goats during the dry season. Since we hypothesize that the high incidence of early abortion is associated with deficiencies in Iodine, Manganese and Phosphorus, further studies, including studies of aborting and nonaborting goats, will be conducted to test if these deficiencies may actually <b>provoke</b> <b>abortion</b> 198...|$|R
40|$|Canids are {{the main}} hosts of Neospora caninum, but cattle, (sheep, goats and horses may serve as {{intermediary}} hosts.

This study {{is the first to}} report lamb abortion associated with N. caninum in Mato Grosso do Sul. Epidemiological data were obtained from interviews with sheep producers. For microscopic examination, fragments of different organs removed from 4 sheep fetuses, aborted and necropsied, were fixed in 10 % formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin and subjected to the hematoxylin-eosin staining protocol and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to test for N. caninum and Toxoplasma gondii. The abortion outbreak studied was reported from a herd of 268 Santa Inês sheep (including 186 pregnant ewes), with 10 abortion cases in the last third of gestation. Four fetuses were examined, 3 from a same ewe. At necropsy, one fetus exhibited crackling in the lung and all its organs were reddish. Histological findings detected mononuclear cell infiltrates among myocardium fibers and around blood vessels, in addition to circular structures with basophilic points resembling protozoans. IHC tests revealed strongly positive staining for N. caninum and weakly positive for T. gondii, characterizing N. caninum infection...|$|R
40|$|Whilst it {{is presumed}} that {{infection}} of pregnant cattle with Neospora caninum oocysts can <b>provoke</b> <b>abortion</b> {{and is the}} likely cause of epidemic abortion outbreaks, only two previous experiments have involved inoculation of pregnant cows with oocysts (and only one <b>abortion</b> was <b>provoked</b> in 22 pregnancies). Here, we describe the oral oocyst challenge of 18 cows synchronously bred and inoculated precisely at 70 (n = 6), 120 (n = 6) and 210 (n = 6) days in pregnancy with a nominal dose of 40, 000 oocysts. Only one abortion occurred (at the 120 days challenge) which could be definitively ascribed to N. caninum and no transplacental infection (TPI) was detected {{in any of the}} other 11 calves born in the 70 and 120 day challenge groups. In contrast, 4 / 5 live calves born to cattle challenged at 210 days were transplacentally infected. When cows which had transplacentally infected their calves in the first pregnancy were rebred, no TPI occurred. The results show that the timing of challenge influences clinical and parasitological outcomes and that cattle in late pregnancy are exquisitely sensitive to oocyst challenge leading to exogenous TPI and congenitally infected calves. However, cattle which were indisputably systemically infected in their first pregnancy did not induce endogenous TPI in their subsequent pregnancy. This confirms previous results with experimental tachyzoite challenge and suggests that post-natal infection does not lead to persisting infections which can recrudesce in pregnancy...|$|R

40|$|This article {{reflects}} {{on a recent}} exhibition hosted at the Sydney Justice and Police Museum. The Femme Fatale exhibition aimed to highlight the way “society has interpreted and contained the criminality of women”, through the depiction of women convicted of various crimes, including abortion related offences. This article discusses the abortion display of the exhibition to explore the longstanding political anxiety <b>provoked</b> by <b>abortion</b> imagery. It focuses on the ongoing power {{of the image of}} abortion, and the female abortionist in particular, and questions the potential for the deployment of such imagery in a feminist context. The article argues that by focusing on the female abortionist as she was targeted by the police, and not on catastrophic outcomes for her patients, the Femme Fatale exhibition highlights the historical, mundane realities of women's reproductive lives, and the centrality of women's networks to this world. It challenges hegemonic medical authority that has claimed women's reproductive praxis as its own, and importantly, alludes to the power historically deployed by midwives before this medical colonisation. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHistorical {{data in the}} 1950 s {{suggests}} that 7 %, 11 %, 33 %, and 87 % of couples were infertile by ages 30, 35, 40 and 45, respectively. Up to 22. 3 % of infertile couples have unexplained infertility. Oxidative stress is associated with male and female infertility. However, there is insufficient evidence relating {{to the influence of}} oxidative stress on the maintenance of a viable pregnancy, including pregnancy complications and fetal development. Recently, we have established Tet-mev- 1 conditional transgenic mice, which can express the doxycycline-induced mutant SDHCV 69 E transgene and experience mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction leading to intracellular oxidative stress. In this report, we demonstrate that this kind of abnormal mitochondrial respiratory chain-induced chronic oxidative stress affects fertility, pregnancy and delivery rates as well as causes recurrent abortions, occasionally resulting in maternal death. Despite this, spermatogenesis and early embryogenesis are completely normal, indicating the mutation's effects to be rather subtle. Female Tet-mev- 1 mice exhibit thrombocytosis and splenomegaly in both non-pregnant and pregnant mice as well as placental angiodysplasia with reduced Flt- 1 protein leading to hypoxic conditions, which could contribute to placental inflammation and fetal abnormal angiogenesis. Collectively these data strongly suggest that chronic oxidative stress caused by mitochondrial mutations <b>provokes</b> spontaneous <b>abortions</b> and recurrent miscarriage resulting in age-related female infertility...|$|R

40|$|O objetivo {{principal}} desta pesquisa foi investigar eficácia adaptativa de mulheres que vivenciaram abortamento e freqüentam um Ambulatório de Reprodução Humana. Os objetivos específicos foram: avaliar a eficácia adaptativa; identificar as repercussões psicológicas destes abortamentos. O instrumento utilizado foi a entrevista clínica preventiva- EDAO (Escala Diagnóstica Adaptativa Operacionalizada). Participaram do estudo 10 mulheres que freqüentavam um Ambulatório especializado em Reprodução Assistida. Os resultados deste trabalho revelaram que o abortamento teve uma repercussão importante no mundo interno e externo das mulheres que participaram desta pesquisa. Os abortamentos provocados e espontâneos são relatados com intensa angústia, tristeza, culpa e sentimentos de inferioridade. No caso do abortamento espontâneo predomina o medo de perder novamente, e no caso de aborto provocado, predominam sentimentos de culpa. As pacientes, de forma geral, apresentam intensa angústia e expectativa em relação ao tratamento; porém a experiência do tratamento para engravidar, somado à experiência anterior de abortamento, intensificou as angústias dessas mulheres. A psicoterapia breve operacionalizada pode auxiliar a paciente a lidar de forma mais adequada com os conflitos vividos no tratamento. E no caso específico deste estudo, auxiliar também a elaboração das perdas anteriores. Este estudo trouxe questionamentos relevantes sobre a vivência emocional de mulheres que buscam tratamento para engravidar e já sofreram abortamento espontâneo ou provocado. A realização de outros estudos é fundamental para maior compreensão do tema. (AU) The {{main objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the adaptive efficacy of women who experienced induced and spontaneous abortion and who attend a Human Reproduction Ambulatory. The specific objectives were: to evaluate the adaptive efficacy; verify and identify the repercussions associated with these abortion; and verify the repercussions that affect the adaptive efficacy. The instrument used in this study was the clinical preventive interview (EDAO Operationalized Adaptive Diagnostic Scale). Ten (10) women who were currently attending the Assisted Human Reproduction Ambulatory participated in the study. The results show that the abortion has an important repercussion in both internal and external worlds of the participant women. Both induced and spontaneous abortion were related to with intense angust, sadness, guilt, and inferiority feelings. Women who had spontaneous abortion predominantly presented fear of suffering it again; whereas those who <b>provoked</b> the <b>abortion</b> presented strong feelings of guilt. Women who attend a Human Reproduction Ambulatory present intense angst and great expectations towards treatment. The experience with the pregnancy attempt treatment added to the prior miscarriage experience intensified the angst of these women. Brief operationalized psychotherapy can help patients deal more adequately with the conflicts experienced during treatment. This specific study also contributes with the elaboration of prior losses. This study questions upon the emotional experience of women that seek pregnancy treatments after going through provoked or spontaneous miscarriages.

40|$|Working in {{abortion}} care presented a {{unique set of}} social, emotional and practical challenges for staff. Because of working {{in abortion}} care some staff expressed a sense of isolation from other colleagues. They said that those who didn’t work in abortion care considered it an unpopular job and perceived patients requesting abortion as more ‘challenging ‘and ‘problematic’ than other patients, partly because of the additional time required but also because of the emotional investment which is associated with the role. Staff’s sense of isolation was manifested because they felt they couldn’t talk to others about their job. Irrespective of their perceived sense of isolation the desire to provide a service for women in need was a motivational factor for those staff who had chosen to work in this area. Although staff, said personal opinions did not have a place in the delivery of care some were unable to disassociate themselves professionally from their own deeply held personal convictions. In addition, some said that they felt unable to voice opposition to an expectation that they would work in this area if it was included as part of a wider women’s health remit. They indicated that sometimes their feelings were compromised by this aspect of the role indicating they felt unable to exercise their right to conscientious objection. The subject of repeat <b>abortion</b> <b>provoked</b> particularly negative staff emotions for personal and professional reasons, especially if patients repeatedly accessed abortion services because of non use of contraception. Often staff admitted they wanted to ‘lecture’ patients about the issue and some implied that eventually patients may be less likely to receive good care in these instances. However staff reported that women who requested abortion for foetal abnormality were likely to receive more sympathy, understanding and care. The practical challenges mainly concerned whether facilities were appropriate, available and accessible for patient care. Staff recommended that facilities ideally shouldn’t be sited near ante-natal or post-natal areas and there should be provision locally for late gestation abortion and swift access...|$|R
