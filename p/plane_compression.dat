40|$|The {{objective}} of this part is to compare the results calculated from the model developed in part I with experimental measurements. Five warp-knitted spacer fabrics made with polyester filaments but with different thicknesses and outer layer structures, as well as different spacer yarn fineness, are selected for testing their compression properties under both the plane plate and spherical ball compressions. The <b>plane</b> <b>compression</b> stress-strain curve of each fabric sample {{is divided into three}} regions and the curve segment in each region is approximately represented by a linear equation. The equation constants, that is, modulus E and intercept σ 0 for each curve segment, are obtained by the linear fitting method. Based on the values of E and σ 0 obtained, the compression curve under spherical ball compression of each fabric sample is calculated and compared with the experimental one. Three compression parameters, including the maximal compression force and compression work at the compression strain of 0. 70, as well as the linear degree, are also used for comparison. Good agreements are obtained between the calculations and measurements. Thus, based on the <b>plane</b> <b>compression</b> testing results, the validated model can be used to predict the spherical compression behaviors of knitted spacer fabrics compressed with different radii of the spherical balls.

The anchoring condition for the grafted chains is chosen such that their first bonds are oriented along the normal to the substrate <b>plane.</b> <b>Compression</b> of such a semi-flexible brush by a planar piston is observed to be a two-stage process: for small compressions the chains contract by "buckling" deformation whereas for larger compression the chains exhibit a collective (almost uniform) bending deformation. Thus, the stiff polymer brush undergoes a 2 -nd order phase transition of collective bond reorientation. The pressure, required to keep the stiff brush at a given degree of compression, is thereby significantly smaller than for an otherwise identical brush made of entirely flexible polymer chains! While both the brush height and the chain linear dimension in the z-direction perpendicular to the substrate increase monotonically with increasing chain stiffness, lateral (xy) chain linear dimensions exhibit a maximum at intermediate chain stiffness. Increasing the grafting density leads to a strong decrease of these lateral dimensions, compatible with an exponential decay. Also the recovery kinetics after removal of the compressing piston is studied, and found to follow a power-law / exponential decay with time.
