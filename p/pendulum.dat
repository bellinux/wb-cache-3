5|$|In England, the {{manufacturing}} of <b>pendulum</b> clocks was soon taken up. The longcase clock (also {{known as the}} grandfather clock) was first created to house the <b>pendulum</b> and works by the English clockmaker William Clement in 1670 or 1671; this became feasible after Clement invented the anchor escapement mechanism in about 1670. Before then, <b>pendulum</b> clocks used the older verge escapement mechanism, which required very wide <b>pendulum</b> swings of about 100°. To avoid {{the need for a}} very large case, most clocks using the verge escapement had a short <b>pendulum.</b> The anchor mechanism, however, reduced the pendulum's necessary swing to between 4° to 6°, allowing clockmakers to use longer pendulums with consequently slower beats. These required less power to move, caused less friction and wear, and were more accurate than their shorter predecessors. Most longcase clocks use a <b>pendulum</b> about a metre (39inches) long {{to the center of the}} bob, with each swing taking one second. This requirement for height, along with the need for a long drop space for the weights that power the clock, gave rise to the tall, narrow case.|$|E
5|$|Innovations to the {{mechanical}} clock continued, with miniaturization leading to domestic clocks in the 15th century, and personal watches in the 16th. In the 1580s, the Italian polymath Galileo Galilei investigated the regular swing of the <b>pendulum,</b> {{and discovered that}} it could be used to regulate a clock. Although Galileo studied the <b>pendulum</b> as early as 1582, he never actually constructed a clock based on that design. The first <b>pendulum</b> clock was designed and built by Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens, in 1656. Early versions erred by less than one minute per day, and later ones only by 10seconds, very accurate for their time.|$|E

25|$|Zinc-steel {{gridiron}} <b>pendulums</b> {{are made}} with 5 rods, but the thermal expansion of brass is closer to steel, so brass-steel gridirons usually require 9 rods. Gridiron <b>pendulums</b> adjust to temperature changes faster than mercury <b>pendulums,</b> but scientists found that friction of the rods sliding in their holes in the frame caused gridiron <b>pendulums</b> to adjust {{in a series of}} tiny jumps. In high precision clocks this caused the clock's rate to change suddenly with each jump. Later it was found that zinc is subject to creep. For these reasons mercury <b>pendulums</b> were used in the highest precision clocks, but gridirons were used in quality regulator clocks.|$|R
25|$|Gridiron <b>pendulums</b> {{became so}} {{associated}} with good quality that, to this day, many ordinary clock <b>pendulums</b> have decorative 'fake' gridirons that don't actually have any temperature compensation function.|$|R

5|$|In early 1946, British fan John Carnell {{launched}} a new science fiction magazine titled New Worlds, published by <b>Pendulum</b> Publications. The first issue appeared in July 1946 and failed to sell well. The second issue, in October of that year, sold better, but <b>Pendulum</b> {{went out of business}} before the end of 1947 with only one more issue released. A group of sf fans, including Carnell and Frank Cooper, decided to restart the magazine under their own control, and formed Nova Publications Ltd. The fourth issue appeared in April 1949.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{invention}} of <b>pendulum</b> clock, Huygens' spiral hairspring (balance spring) system of portable timekeepers, helped lay the foundations for the modern watchmaking industry. The application of the spiral balance spring for watches ushered {{in a new era}} of accuracy for portable timekeepers, similar to that which the <b>pendulum</b> had introduced for clocks. From its invention in 1675 by Christiaan Huygens, the spiral hairspring (balance spring) system for portable timekeepers, still used in mechanical watchmaking industry today.|$|E
50|$|When {{released}} at any arbitrary starting position, the <b>pendulum’s</b> motion evolves {{into one of}} a discrete set of stable oscillation modes, having sharply differing amplitudes, but approximately {{the same period of}} oscillation - close to the <b>pendulum’s</b> undisturbed period (Fig. 2). In each such mode, the energy lost by friction in the <b>pendulum’s</b> motion, is compensated by an average net energy transfer from the oscillating magnetic field, in a self-regulating manner.|$|R

He straps {{him to a}} stone slab located {{directly}} beneath a huge razor-sharp <b>pendulum.</b> The <b>pendulum</b> {{is attached to a}} clockwork apparatus that causes it to descend fractions of an inch after each swing, ever closer to Francis's torso. Catherine arrives just in time with Maximillian, one of the servants. After a brief struggle with Maximillian, Nicholas falls to his death in the pit. Francis is removed from the torture device. As they leave the basement, Catherine vows to seal up the chamber forever. They slam and lock the door shut, unaware that Elizabeth is still alive, gagged and trapped in the iron maiden.|$|E

5|$|In 1670, Gabriel Mouton, a French abbot and astronomer, {{published}} the book Observationes diametrorum solis et lunae apparentium {{in which he}} proposed a decimal system of measurement of length for use by scientists in international communication, {{to be based on}} the dimensions of the Earth. The milliare would be defined as a minute of arc along a meridian and would be divided into 10 centuria, the centuria into 10 decuria and so on, successive units being the virga, virgula, decima, centesima, and the millesima. Mouton used Riccioli's estimate that one degree of arc was 321,185 Bolognese feet, and his own experiments showed that a <b>pendulum</b> of length one virgula would beat 3959.2 times in half an hour. Current <b>pendulum</b> theory shows that such a <b>pendulum</b> would have had an equivalent length of 205.6mm – using today's knowledge of the size of the earth, the virgula would have been approximately 185.2mm. He believed that with this information scientists in a foreign country would be able to construct a copy of the virgula for their own use.|$|E
5|$|Lethbridge's {{next book}} was ESP – Beyond Time and Distance, {{published}} in 1965. It {{dealt with the}} theme of extra-sensory perception and articulated Lethbridge's argument that rays of energy were transmitted from every object, {{and that they could}} be detected using <b>pendulum</b> dowsing. In 1966 he published A Step in the Dark, which repeated many of his theories regarding <b>pendulum</b> dowsing present in earlier works. Early that year, Lethbridge first began struggling against heart disease, an affliction that had resulted from his obesity. In both his books and private letters from this period he regularly ranted against modern life and society, while in other correspondences with individuals in the United States he championed the authenticity of the Kensington Runestone and Westford Knight.|$|E

5|$|Alexander Bain, a Scottish {{clock and}} {{instrument}} maker, {{was the first}} to invent and patent the electric clock in 1840. On January 11, 1841, Alexander Bain along with John Barwise, a chronometer maker, took out another important patent describing a clock in which an electromagnetic <b>pendulum</b> and an electric current is employed to keep the clock going instead of springs or weights. Later patents expanded on his original ideas.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half of the 20th century, the <b>pendulum</b> had swung back towards road transport. The Cromford Canal was largely {{abandoned}} in 1944, and several of the rail lines passing through the Peak were closed as uneconomic in the 1960s as part of the Beeching Axe. The Woodhead Line was closed between Hadfield and Penistone. Parts of the trackbed are now used for the Trans Pennine Trail, the stretch between Hadfield and Woodhead being known specifically as the Longdendale Trail.|$|E

The federal government responded by sending more troops to Texas.|$|E
5|$|In 1612, having {{determined}} the orbital periods of Jupiter's satellites, Galileo proposed that with sufficiently accurate {{knowledge of their}} orbits, one could use their positions as a universal clock, and this would make possible the determination of longitude. He worked on this problem {{from time to time}} during the remainder of his life, but the practical problems were severe. The method was first successfully applied by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1681 and was later used extensively for large land surveys; this method, for example, was used to survey France, and later by Zebulon Pike of the midwestern United States in 1806. For sea navigation, where delicate telescopic observations were more difficult, the longitude problem eventually required development of a practical portable marine chronometer, such as that of John Harrison. Late in his life, when totally blind, Galileo designed an escapement mechanism for a <b>pendulum</b> clock (called Galileo's escapement), although no clock using this was built until after the first fully operational <b>pendulum</b> clock was made by Christiaan Huygens in the 1650s.|$|E
5|$|In his 1638 Discorsi, Galileo's {{character}} Salviati, {{widely regarded}} as Galileo's spokesman, held that all unequal weights would fall with the same finite speed in a vacuum. But this had previously been proposed by Lucretius and Simon Stevin. Cristiano Banti's Salviati also held it could be experimentally demonstrated by the comparison of <b>pendulum</b> motions in air with bobs of lead and of cork which had different weight but which were otherwise similar.|$|E

40|$|Synopsis　It is {{well known}} that the <b>pendulums</b> coupled by a string show the {{interesting}} situation of the motion such as the exchanging amplitudes and the periodisities by selecting the initial conditions. The problems of vibration on the dynarmcal system with the finite degree of freedom and on the non-stationary vibration can not be solved by assuming the usual harmonic oscillation. They are successfully performed by the application of Laplace transformation to the equation of motion. 　The investigation is performed about a simple model with equivalent two <b>pendulums</b> taking the displacements of fulcra and the transversal swings of them into accounts. The time dependence of mass positions of swinging <b>pendulums</b> can be represented in terms of the relative length of <b>pendulums.</b> 　Theoretical curves in this method agree reasonably with the experimental results. It is remarked that one can handle precisely the vibration of coupled <b>pendulums</b> without regarding to numbers in the system. It is touched in the discussions that the investigation plays an important role at undergraduate course in the engineering education...|$|R
