40|$|Abstract—To {{provide a}} high quality <b>power</b> {{delivery}} system, the <b>power</b> needs to be regulated on-chip with ultra-small locally dis-tributed <b>power</b> efficient converters. Historically, <b>power</b> efficient switching converters require large physical area, while compact linear <b>power</b> supplies exhibit high <b>power</b> conversion losses, which are not ideal for on-chip integration. To exploit the advantages of existing <b>power</b> supplies, a heterogeneous <b>power</b> delivery system is proposed. The <b>power</b> efficiency {{of the system is}} shown to be a strong function of the on-chip distribution of the <b>power</b> supplies. The optimal <b>power</b> distribution system with minimum <b>power</b> losses is determined by exhaustively comparing the <b>power</b> efficiency for all possible <b>power</b> supply topologies. A heterogeneous system with ten on-chip voltage domains and an optimal <b>power</b> distribution network has been evaluated, demonstrating up to 93 % <b>power</b> effi-ciency. A <b>power</b> efficient clustering of the on-chip <b>power</b> supplies with linear computational complexity is also proposed. Hetero-geneous <b>power</b> delivery systems with up to 100 on-chip voltage domains have been evaluated with <b>power</b> supplies distributed with linear computational complexity. A maximum 1. 5 % drop in <b>power</b> efficiency from the optimal solution has been observed, yielding a near optimal and high fidelity <b>power</b> supply distribution system.

40|$|Summary of Invention In {{accordance}} with {{an aspect of}} the invention there is provided a method for allocating a plurality of <b>power</b> reserves to deliver <b>power</b> to a <b>power</b> network to meet a <b>power</b> reserve requirement for balancing a frequency of the <b>power</b> network. The method comprises obtaining, for a plurality of <b>power</b> reserves of a <b>power</b> network, <b>power</b> reserve flexibility characteristics associated with each <b>power</b> reserve. The method further comprises obtaining, for the plurality of <b>power</b> reserves, an indexing value associated with the delivery of <b>power</b> by each of the <b>power</b> reserves. The method further comprises determining a <b>power</b> reserve requirement associated with the <b>power</b> network. The method further comprises assigning {{one or more of the}} plurality of <b>power</b> reserves to deliver <b>power</b> to the <b>power</b> network, the plurality of <b>power</b> reserves assigned in {{accordance with}} the <b>power</b> reserve flexibility characteristics associated with each of the <b>power</b> reserves, the indexing value associated with each of the <b>power</b> reserves, and the <b>power</b> reserve requirement associated with the <b>power</b> network. The <b>power</b> reserve flexibility characteristics may be indicative of <b>power</b> deliverable to the <b>power</b> network by the respective <b>power</b> reserve with respect to time. The <b>power</b> reserve flexibility characteristics may include characteristics of positive and/or negative <b>power</b> reserve flexibility. The <b>power</b> reserve flexibility characteristics may include one or more of a maximum deliverable <b>power,</b> a period of time to provide the maximum deliverable <b>power</b> from receipt of an instruction for <b>power</b> delivery, a minimum duration for sustaining the maximum deliverable <b>power</b> and a period of time to reduce <b>power</b> delivery from the maximum deliverable <b>power</b> to a minimum deliverable <b>power.</b> The assigning of one or more of the plurality of <b>power</b> reserves may further comprise selecting one or more of the plurality <b>power</b> reserves to provide the <b>power</b> reserve requirement in order of the indexing value associated with the <b>power</b> reserve. The method may further comprise ordering the <b>power</b> reserves in accordance with the indexing value associated with each <b>power</b> reserve prior to selecting the one or more <b>power</b> reserves to provide the <b>power</b> reserve requirement. The assigning of one or more of the plurality of <b>power</b> reserves may further comprise determining a portion of the <b>power</b> reserve requirement of the <b>power</b> network provided by each selected <b>power</b> reserve in accordance with the respective <b>power</b> reserve flexibility characteristics of the <b>power</b> reserves. Assigning the one or more <b>power</b> reserves may further comprise determining if, for a particular instance in time, the <b>power</b> reserve requirement is met by the assigned one or more <b>power</b> reserves, assigning a next <b>power</b> reserve to deliver <b>power</b> to the <b>power</b> network if the <b>power</b> reserve requirement is not met, the next <b>power</b> reserve determined from the order of the indexing values associated with the respective <b>power</b> reserves and adjusting a <b>power</b> to be delivered to the <b>power</b> network by a most recently allocated reserve of the one or more <b>power</b> reserves that have been assigned to provide <b>power</b> at that instant in time to a level of <b>power</b> sufficient to meet the <b>power</b> reserve requirement at that instant in time if the <b>power</b> reserve requirement is met. The <b>power</b> to be delivered by the most recently allocated reserve may be adjusted by subtracting the difference between the <b>power</b> reserve requirement at that instant in time and a summation of a <b>power</b> to be delivered at that instant in time by each of the <b>power</b> reserves assigned to deliver <b>power</b> at that instant in time from the <b>power</b> to be delivered at that instant in time by the most recently allocated reserve assigned to deliver <b>power</b> at that instant in time. Assigning the one or more <b>power</b> reserves may further comprise determining if the one or more assigned <b>power</b> reserves provide the <b>power</b> reserve requirement, continuing assigning the reserves if the <b>power</b> reserve requirement is not met and stopping the assigning the reserves if the <b>power</b> reserve requirement is met. The method may further comprise determining, prior to assigning one or more of the <b>power</b> reserves, whether or not the plurality of <b>power</b> reserves will be able to provide the <b>power</b> reserve requirement from the <b>power</b> reserve flexibility characteristics associated with the plurality of <b>power</b> reserves. The <b>power</b> reserve requirement associated with the <b>power</b> network may be a <b>power</b> required to be delivered to the network over a period of time. The <b>power</b> reserve requirement associated with a <b>power</b> network may be determined by estimating a <b>power</b> reserve requirement associated with the <b>power</b> network. The <b>power</b> reserve flexibility characteristics may be obtained from a memory. The indexing value may be obtained from a memory. The method may further comprise receiving the <b>power</b> reserve flexibility characteristics and receiving the indexing values. The <b>power</b> reserve flexibility characteristics associated with the <b>power</b> reserves may be received from the respective <b>power</b> reserves. The method may further comprise instructing the <b>power</b> reserves to deliver <b>power</b> in accordance with the assignment of the <b>power</b> reserves. A <b>power</b> reserve may be a <b>power</b> generator or a <b>power</b> load. The indexing value may be a financial cost associated with the <b>power</b> reserve delivering the <b>power.</b> The indexing value may be an environmental impact associated with the <b>power</b> reserve delivering the <b>power.</b> In accordance with another aspect of the invention there is provided an apparatus for allocating a plurality of <b>power</b> reserves to deliver <b>power</b> to a <b>power</b> network to meet a <b>power</b> reserve requirement of the <b>power</b> network. The apparatus comprises a processor arranged to perform any method disclosed herein. The apparatus may be a central controller associated with management of the <b>power</b> network. In accordance with another aspect of the invention there is provided a computer readable medium comprising computer readable code operable, in use, to instruct a computer to perform any method disclosed herein. According to {{an aspect of the}} invention there is provided a method for allocating <b>power</b> reserves in a <b>power</b> network. The method comprises determining a <b>power</b> reserve requirement associated with the <b>power</b> network. The method then comprises assigning <b>power</b> reserves associated with the network to deliver <b>power</b> for meeting the <b>power</b> reserve requirement, the <b>power</b> reserves assigned according to an indexing value associated with delivery of <b>power</b> by respective <b>power</b> reserves. Throughout this disclosure it will be understood that each indexing value assigned to a <b>power</b> reserve may correspond to a financial cost associated with that reserve. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a method for allocating <b>power</b> reserves in a <b>power</b> network. The method comprises determining a <b>power</b> reserve requirement associated with the <b>power</b> network. The method then comprises assigning <b>power</b> reserves associated with the network for meeting the determined <b>power</b> reserve requirement, the <b>power</b> reserves assigned according to a <b>power</b> response characteristic associated with each of the <b>power</b> reserves. According to a further aspect of the invention a method for allocating <b>power</b> resources provided by a plurality of <b>power</b> reserves in a <b>power</b> network to meet a <b>power</b> reserve requirement of the <b>power</b> network is provided. The method comprises obtaining, for a plurality of <b>power</b> reserves, information indicative of <b>power</b> response characteristics associated with <b>power</b> resources provided by the respective <b>power</b> reserves. The method also comprises obtaining, for the plurality of <b>power</b> reserves, information indicative of an indexing value associated with the <b>power</b> resources provided by the respective <b>power</b> reserves. In addition, the method comprises determining a <b>power</b> reserve requirement associated with a <b>power</b> network. The method also comprises assigning one or more <b>power</b> resources provided by the plurality of <b>power</b> reserves in accordance with the <b>power</b> response characteristics and the indexing value associated with each <b>power</b> resource provided by the plurality of <b>power</b> reserves to provide the <b>power</b> resource requirement. The <b>power</b> response characteristic may be considered as a deliverable <b>power</b> response of a <b>power</b> reserve. Also the <b>power</b> response characteristic may be considered as a mapping of the highest <b>power</b> and longest duration positive and negative <b>power</b> response with respect to time associated with a <b>power</b> reserve. Such a system of mapping of <b>power</b> reserve supply and reserve requirement allows for simple description of any flexible resource, intermittent source or frequency service regardless of their particular dynamic response. Once the method is complete, the reserve requirement may be fully accounted for by the cumulative supply provided by the least expensive available reserves. The method may be applicable to forecasted worst-case intermittency, or can be applied to state of the art frequency control services such that reserves are allocated to individual FCR, FRR or RR services. The cumulative supply can be decomposed to determine and share cost of intermittency. The method may provide intuitive visual reserve adequacy assessment and user input allocation via a user interface. The methods described herein allow for available resources to be used to their fullest which can bring down the price of reserves and may lead to a significant cost reduction for the various system operators by enlarging the pool of available reserves. A system for defining resources irrespective of type is disclosed. Consequently, a single definition system is provided to identify the <b>power</b> characteristics of flexible resources, intermittent resources, or frequency services regardless of their particular dynamic response. A system that enables a user to be provided with a visual reserve adequacy assessment and reserve distribution is disclosed...|$|R
