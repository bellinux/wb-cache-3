2500|$|In 1940, a {{consortium}} of state motor vehicle administrators standardized upon a system of two [...] round sealed beam headlamps on all vehicles—the only system allowed for 17 years. A system of four round lamps, rather than two, one high/low and one high-beam [...] sealed beam {{on each side of}} the vehicle, introduced in 1957 by Cadillac, Chrysler, DeSoto and Nash on some of their car models in states that permitted the new system. Other American marques followed suit when all states permitted quad lamps in 1958. These lamps permitted more design flexibility. Auto stylists such as Virgil Exner carried out design studies with the low beams in their conventional outboard location, and the high beams vertically stacked at the center-line of the car. No such designs reached volume production; most cars had their headlights in pairs side by side {{on each side of the}} car, and some Oldsmobiles had a <b>parking</b> <b>light</b> in the middle of each pair.|$|E
2500|$|Z02 - Spyder {{appearance}} : Black highlights on front, {{side and}} rear of body headlight openings, <b>parking</b> <b>light</b> openings, windshield, rear window and side window moldings, body sill, door and center pillar louvers, {{rear end panel}} - (bright window moldings with black exterior), black or gold rear accents (taillight blackouts and rear end panel decals), body color front air dam and rear spoiler, Spyder emblems (front facia, rear lock cover and sport steering wheel horn button insert), body side stripes with Spyder lettering in red, white or gold depending on body color, black painted styled-steel wheels with trim rings and center caps, black sport mirrors, special hood decal and rear spoiler decal. For the 1980 model year, Chevrolet combined the Spyder equipment and appearance packages into one Spyder equipment package with an RPO code of Z29 and included newly re-designed bold Spyder side decals and a new front air dam that blends into the front fender wheel openings. [...] Spyder decal color choices (five) were based primarily upon the interior color specified rather than the body color as in previous years.|$|E
2500|$|For 1979 all {{versions}} of the American came with the redesigned aluminum bumpers with plastic side end caps, dual quad headlights over a transparent <b>parking</b> <b>light,</b> and the [...] "waterflow" [...] plastic grille. The station wagon with automatic transmission obtained a new designation and became the Camioneta American DL. The American GFS got a treatment more similar to its AMC counterpart with {{the removal of the}} targa band retaining the Landau half-vinyl top. The side opera windows were changed to fixed units, which incorporated a unique VAM-designed sandblasted GFS emblem. Both the base and high-trim versions incorporated a shared new design of side panels, the only difference between them being a low carpet insert for the top-end models. All units with column-mounted shifters and automatic transmission obtained a new gear indicator integrated into the speedometer, replacing the previous unit fixed on top of the steering column. The flip-style digital clock was replaced by a quartz electronic one. The list of optional equipment was expanded with the possibility of ordering a monaural AM FM radio on the three high trim versions. For some reason, no wheelcovers were offered this year, thus the luxury editions incorporated bright narrow volcano hubcaps with VAM a logo and wheel trim rings. The custom steering wheel got a new design for the year with a soft rectangular button and tiny metal VAM emblem.|$|E

50|$|As {{well as a}} full body, the {{standard}} Leader features included a headlight trimmer, an extendable lifting handle for easy centrestand use, and a permanent windscreen mounting. Factory listed options included: integrated-design hard-luggage 'panniers', the first flashing indicators on a British motorcycle, a dash-mounted <b>parking</b> <b>light,</b> windscreen top-extension (adjustable on the move), a rear rack and a clock aperture built into a 'dashboard' (closed-off by an Ariel badge when not fitted).|$|E

50|$|In the USA, {{parking lights}} were {{installed}} {{next to the}} headlights for MY 1990-1991 within dedicated corner lenses, then incorporated with the front turn signals from 1992 to current models. Parking lights for European, Australian and Japanese versions were incorporated inside the headlights, on the outer edge. All international versions of the Legacy utilize a dedicated <b>parking</b> <b>light</b> switch installed {{on top of the}} steering column until model year 2010.|$|E
5000|$|The {{electrical}} system was 6V Positive ground, dual front (referred to as [...] "Town and Country") horns and a passenger side Brake and <b>Parking</b> <b>light</b> were options {{that could have}} been added on at either the dealership or factory. Turn signal systems had not yet been implemented, the generator used a [...] "Cut-out" [...] relay which only used 1 wire for its generating system. Voltage regulators weren't implemented until 1935.|$|E
50|$|The third {{series of}} the Impreza is {{slightly}} longer, wider and offers a longer wheelbase. Two Subaru traditions were discontinued with the new model: the <b>parking</b> <b>light</b> switch atop the steering column is no longer present, {{and for the first}} time the windows have frames to improve noise, vibration, and harshness levels. Subaru made an effort to control the weight of the new chassis. Despite the increase in size, stiffness, and safety equipment, the car's weight is similar to the previous generation. The front suspension uses a MacPherson strut setup, while the rear features a new double wishbone suspension.|$|E

There were some of each model that were re-serialed 1953s with 1954 trim hung on them {{and then there was the}} regular run in which some of the Aces and Eagles received the Kaiser Super-Hurricane engine. On the regular run, all Aeros received wraparound one piece windshields and rear windows and a new instrument panel, even the Lark. All 1954s received larger taillights, [...] "hooded" [...] headlight and <b>parking</b> <b>light</b> bezels, and different bumper guards. Nameplates were shuffled slightly on the regular run cars.|$|E
50|$|Bulbs of {{this type}} are {{commonly}} used in automotive lighting and in low-voltage lighting used in landscape lighting. The bulb may have dual filaments, acting as both a low-wattage tail light or <b>parking</b> <b>light</b> and a higher-wattage brake light or turn signal. In this case, one has its contacts {{near the center of}} the base, and the other toward the outside edges, so that they cannot be accidentally swapped. Along with putting contacts on the opposite (alternating) sides, this gives the base rotational symmetry so that the user does not have to determine the exact position of the bulb before inserting a new one.|$|E
5000|$|In both 1971 and 72, {{both the}} El Camino and Sprint {{shared the same}} body styling as the Chevelle from the cowl to the front bumper. The 1971 models {{featured}} the Chevelle's twin <b>parking</b> <b>light</b> lenses, dual [...] "high intensity" [...] headlights and horizontally-divided front grille. A large [...] "GMC" [...] badge replaced the Chevy bowtie and for models with optional engines, engine badges (depicting cubic inch size), identical {{to those of the}} counterpart Chevrolet, were placed just below the divider bar {{on the left side of}} the grille. Both years featured rear end styling taken from the Chevelle station wagon (and were shared with El Camino).|$|E

5000|$|The USA {{machines}} usually came standard with a trip-meter {{and minimal}} AC lighting, with a speedometer as an option, whereas PE's in Australia and Belgium (for example) had speedometers, stop lights, horn, 6V DC battery and charging system to suit, by law. The UK machines {{did not have}} indicators or battery; however these did come with an AC horn. The lighting requirements varied across years and countries, so a PE in the UK, South Africa or France might have substantially different rear tail-lights and mounting assemblies {{to those in the}} USA. The French PE's (for example) continued to use the PE250B style headlamp shell, with a <b>parking</b> <b>light</b> and a yellow globe insert, due to local regulations.|$|E
5000|$|The Mark VI {{had more}} ornate styling than the Town Car, {{befitting}} its place {{on top of}} the model line. It sported vacuum-operated concealed headlamps, non-functional fender vents, oval opera windows on the C-pillars, a [...] "Continental-esque" [...] trunklid, and a slightly different grille. An unusual optional feature, called [...] "touring lights", were installed externally on the concealed headlamp doors, which gave an appearance of being headlights, when the actual headlights were behind the doors. The touring lights would only turn on if the headlight switch was in the <b>parking</b> <b>light</b> position, and gave a soft glow, but didn't provide enough light to drive in dark conditions. This generation was also installed with Ford's [...] "Auto Lamp" [...] feature, and if the system was active, the touring lights would not be used when the conventional headlights came on. The touring lights also did not function as daytime running lights.|$|E
