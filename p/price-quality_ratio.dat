40|$|Service {{orchestration}} {{has become}} the predominant paradigm that enables businesses to combine and integrate services offered by third parties. For the commercial viability of orchestrated services, {{it is crucial that}} they are offered at sharp <b>price-quality</b> <b>ratios.</b> A complicating factor is that many attractive third-party services often show highly variable service quality. This raises the need for mechanisms that promptly adapt the orchestration to changes in the quality delivered by third party services. In this paper, we propose a real-time QoS control mechanism that dynamically optimizes service orchestration in real time by learning and adapting to changes in third party service response time behaviors. Our approach combines the power of learning and adaptation with the power of dynamic programming. The re¬sults show that real-time service re-compositions lead to dramatic savings of cost, while meeting the service quality requirements of the end-users. The challenge here is to respond to signi?cant response-time changes in a timely manner, while not wasting CPU cycles on unnecessary orchestration updates. Experimental results performed in a test-lab environment demonstrate that a few orchestration updates are suf?cient to achieve this...|$|R

40|$|We offer {{a general}} {{framework}} to study procurement auctions when quality matters. In this environment, sellers {{compete for a}} project by bidding a price-quality pair, and the winning bidder {{is determined by the}} score assigned to each bid. In contrast to the existing study in which only the quasilinear scoring rule is considered, our analysis allows a broad class of scoring rules including many other realistic ones. We focus on the analyses of the equilibrium bidding behavior of first-score (FS) and second-score (SS) auctions. We find that FS or SS auctions can be transformed into equivalent, single-dimensional score-bid auctions where the bidder's utility (payoff upon winning) is non-linear in the score-bid. Our analysis demonstrates that the ranking of the two auction formats, in terms of expected scores, depends on the scoring rule and that the equivalence fails unless scoring rules are quasilinear. FS auctions induce less aggressive bidding than SS auctions if, for example, the scoring rule is <b>price-quality</b> <b>ratio</b> (PQR) ...|$|E

Only if the consumer behaviour is understood one is able to develop and implement marketing strategies as well as products that address market and consumer needs appropriately. As Germany is one of most important import countries for wine this paper solely focusses on the german wine market. It is therefore of major importance to analyse the consumer behaviour, aiming to identify the most valued attributes when choosing portuguese wines, understanding their purchasing habits and their expectations from Portuguese wines. The results of this study showed that german consumers like to drink refreshing white wines as well as slender and classy red wines. Customers who are already used to portuguese wine associate them with exceptional quality and great <b>price-quality</b> <b>ratio.</b> The majority of the sample are lacking of an intellectual connection to portuguese wine though.

40|$|AbstractRetail {{management}} of store brands (SBs) {{has focused on}} achieving positioning in value and creating associations of smart or expert shopping. The result is that value-conscious consumers and market mavens are the main targets of these brands. This study proposes and contrasts empirically a theoretical model {{of the effect of}} market mavenism and value consciousness on consumer identification with SBs. We also perform a multi-group analysis based on the consumer tendency to be loyal to the brands he or she buys. Consumers who are loyal to brands are very attractive segments for firms, due to the potential benefits these consumers represent in the long term, whereas consumers with little loyalty to brands can be an attractive segment for potential benefits in the short term. The results obtained in this study show differences between these two groups. For consumers who are loyal to brands, the results stress strong identification with the SB among the most value-conscious consumers, due fundamentally to their greater disagreement with the greater functional risk of these brands as compared to manufacturer brands and due to their greater conviction of the better <b>price-quality</b> <b>ratio</b> of SBs. In consumers with little brand loyalty, we find identification with the SB among the consumers with the greatest market mavenism, {{as a result of their}} greater perception of smart or expert shopping for these brands.

Destination {{has become a}} product {{that has to be}} promoted and sold in the most advantageous terms. The work bellow is an analysis of "brand equity" concept for touristic destinations, as found in the specific literature. Destination brands differ from product brands, major distinction being given by their stability/ instability. Brands of products are stable; this constant is maintained by the use of quality standards. Even in case of services, situation can be controlled, as quality standards could be perpetuated by a franchise system. Destinations are not depending on a single person, who decides, but a variety of them, economic agents, businesses, institutions and local population that can create/print form and structure changes of the destination. The concept de brand equity applied for touristic destinations, is something relatively recent. The dimensions of a brand for touristic destinations are: awareness, image, loyalty, quality and value. All these dimensions build the branding equity of a destination. There is interdependency, between quality, image, loyalty and value. In order to determine the perception in regards to the quality of tourism services in Romania, in 2010 a comprehensive study was done among the inhabitants of Oradea city. Through this study we have pursued several objectives: to assess the importance of service characteristics, performance evaluation of tourism services in Romania, tourism personnel evaluation, in terms of evaluation and performance, perception of the quality-price ratio for Romania, compared with other tourist destinations.

40|$|The {{transition}} to {{sustainable energy system}} calls for changes in both the production and consumption of energy, including {{issues such as the}} implementation of sustainable technologies and practices for energy conversion and the improvement of energy efficiency at the demand side. This Thesis i) identifies the need of decision support in the commercialization of sustainable energy technologies in buildings, ii) characterizes decision-making problems related to the above context, iii) develops and implements a methodology to assess energy technologies for buildings, and iv) presents two fields of application where the above assessment is essential. The decision-making problem is characterized by i) multiple objectives, ii) several interest groups with different preferences, iii) new alternatives with the lack of operational experiences and thus plenty of uncertainties, and iv) a broad portfolio of applicable technologies that have to be combined into a workable entity. Hence, an interdisciplinary decision support framework is required that combines basic theories of life cycle and decision analyses including sensitivity assessments. In this Thesis, the above methodological framework is implemented in terms of two applications: i) the assessment of heating systems for a single-family house and ii) the selection of technology portfolio in a retrofit project that results in improved energy efficiency and thermal comfort, and reduced environmental burdens. Specifically, the competitiveness of a natural gas heating system containing a solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is examined with respect to residential heating systems containing no electricity generation. Moreover, a multi-criteria portfolio model is applied to determine the most preferred retrofit measures in an apartment building. The above examples are selected because i) they represent a new field of research and ii) they are interesting due to the challenges they provide in decision-making. In the assessment of heating systems that incorporate new technologies, the mutual ranking of alternatives often must be established on the basis of incomplete information. Here, the extensive framework of decision-making was useful. In the second application, the multi-criteria portfolio model was suitable in the search of optimal technological solutions in retrofit projects. According to computational studies, a small (1  kWe) SOFC heating system is an attractive alternative to traditional heating systems and simple, inexpensive measures with good <b>price-quality</b> <b>ratio</b> were preferred as retrofit actions. While the methodological framework is generally applicable, the computational examples are mainly indicative and illustrative. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to build more understanding on a recent phenomenon of increased interest towards Nordic fashion. The aim is to research the topic from consumer’s perspective in order to gain better understanding if the brand origin has an effect on brand evaluations. More specifically, the aim is to research the relationship between brand origin and brand equity. In addition, the impact of age and yearly household income on consumers’ evaluations of fashion brands from various countries is studied. The target population of the study is Finnish females interested in fashion. First, four qualitative background interviews with open-ended questions were made in order to understand different meanings behind researched phenomenon. The topics emerged from qualitative interviews were used when formalizing the final questionnaire. Second, the main data was collected by using a web-based questionnaire, which was published in a two different Finnish fashion related Facebook flea market group: COS & Filippa K kirpputori and Minna Parikka Secondhand. The final amount of analyzed responses was 368. The results of questionnaire were analyzed with the aid of SPSS, involving Pearson correlation, multiple regression and ANOVA test. The correlations between the means of country images and different brand equity dimensions were measured by utilizing the Pearson correlation. While in correlation analysis, the means of country images were used, regression analysis allowed to measure how all the different country image items explain the variation in brand equity score. In regression analysis country image items were used as independent variables and average brand equity score of fashion brands of given country as dependent variable. Finally one-way ANOVA was used to determine mean value differences between different age groups and respondents with different yearly household income. The study suggests that there exists a statistically significant positive correlation between country image and brand equity in the context of fashion. Finnish consumers tend to evaluate Nordic brands higher and thus, the total brand equity scores of Nordic brands were mostly higher than the scores of non-Nordic fashion brands. Overall, Nordic products are seen as timeless, minimalistic and having a good <b>price-quality</b> <b>ratio.</b> Furthermore, the results of study indicate that age influences consumers’ evaluation of the fashion brand depending on the brand origin. However, this research found no evidence to support the relationship between yearly household income and consumers’ evaluations of fashion brands.

40|$|Finnish food producers' {{trade with}} Russia has {{experienced}} profound changes {{since the collapse}} of the Soviet Union. Simultaneously, the distribution systems of foodstuffs have changed remarkably. This study sheds some light into these changes and analyses the current situation in distribution systems of foodstuffs in Russia. In addition, the study discusses the possibilities of Finnish food producers to get more of their products to the shelves of Russian food retail stores. Before the 1998 financial crisis, the import of foreign foodstuffs was booming in Russia due to the overvalued rouble. As a result of the financial crisis, food import collapsed. The export of Finnish foodstuffs to Russia has been slowly recovering during the past few years, but in the most important product categories the pre-crisis levels have so far not been reached and maybe will not be reached. In certain product categories the growth has been only marginal. It seems that starting localproduction will become increasingly important in the future. This is further encouraged by the fact that Russian consumers favour domestic food products. Russian consumers are very price conscious and demand quality in food products. The perceived <b>price-quality</b> <b>ratio</b> is an important criterion in the purchase decision. The majority of foodstuff retail is still conducted via unorganised forms of trade (e. g. kiosks and marketplaces) but modern retail chains are developing at a fast pace in Russia. They are also expected to dominate the retail trade in foodstuffs over the unorganised forms of trade in the future. This will change the distribution systems as well. The retail chains are trying to shorten the distribution chain, similarly to what has been seen in the Western countries. This together with the strengthening of retail chains is likely to shrink the role of wholesalers, as the chains increasingly want to work directly with the producers. Many large retail chains are acquiring or have already acquired a distribution centre or centres in order to boost efficiency and control the flow of products. The strengthening of the retail chains also gives them power in negotiations, which the producers and distributors have to adjust to. For example store entry fees and retail chains' own private label products pose challenges to the food producers. In the food production sector the competition is fierce, as large Russianand foreign producers want to ensure their piece of the market. The largest producers utilise their size: they invest in big marketing campaigns and are willing to pay high entry fees to retail chains in order to secure a place on the store shelves and to build a strong brand in Russia. This complicates the situation from the viewpoint of small producers. Currently, the most popular type of distribution system among the interviewed Finnish food producers is based on a network of local distributors. There is, however, a strong consensus on the importanceof starting local production in order to be a serious actor in Russia in the future. Factors that hinder the starting of local production include the lack of local infrastructure and qualified staff, and the low risk tolerance of Finnish firms. Major barriers for entry in Russia are the actions of authorities, fierce competition, fragmented market and Finnish producers' heavy production costs. The suggested strategies for increasing the market share include focusing geographically or segment-wise, introducing new products, starting local production, andcooperation between Finnish producers. Smallness was one reason why Finnish producers had to cut down their operations in Russia due to the 1998 crisis. Smaller producers had fewer resources to tolerate losses during the period of crisis. Smallness is reflected also on trade negotiations with retail chains and distributors. It makes it harder to cope with the store entry fees and to differentiatefrom the mass of products propped up by expensive advertising. Finally, it makes it harder for Finnish producers to start or expand local production, as it is more difficult for a small producer to get financing and to tolerate the increased risks. Compensating for the smallness might become the crucial factor determining the future success of Finnish food producers in the Russian market...|$|E
