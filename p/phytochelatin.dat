However, the luminescence of the reconstituted metallothionein or <b>phytochelatins</b> was higher when Cu(I) -GSH was the donor. This higher luminescence is presumably due to the stabilizing effect of GSH on Cu(I) -thiolate clusters. As expected, 12 Cu(I) ions were bound per molecule of metallothionein. The Cu(I) binding to <b>phytochelatins</b> depended on their chain length; the binding stoichiometries being 1. 25, 2. 0 and 2. 5 for (gamma-Glu-Cys) 2 Gly, (gamma-Glu-Cys) 3 Gly and (gamma-Glu-Cys) 4 Gly respectively at neutral pH.

The cadmium concentrations assayed were 3, 7. 9, 15, and 30 mg/L. Contents of thiol compounds synthesized by this microalga changed with cadmium concentration and with time of exposure. Cysteine concentrations increased significantly {{compared with those of}} γ-Glu-Cys and glutathione in cultures containing 7. 9, 15, and 30 mg/L. The increase in the amount of glutathione was significant only in cells exposed to the higher cadmium concentrations (15 and 30 mg/L).

A rapid increase in <b>phytochelatins</b> was observed with increased cadmium concentration during the first days of culture. The type of <b>phytochelatins</b> (number of subunits) also was dependent on the concentration of cadmium. The rate of (γ-Glu-Cys) 3 -Gly accumulation was higher than those of other types of <b>phytochelatins</b> throughout the culture in cells exposed to 3, 15, and 30 mg/L. However, in cultures treated with 7. 9 mg/L, (γ-Glu-Cys) 4 -Gly increased substantially after 8 d of culture, exceeding the amount of (γ-Glu-Cys) 3 -Gly.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is to show {{potentialities}} and limitations of electrochemical methods in studying plant metallothioneins - <b>phytochelatins</b> -and their complexes with selected heavy metals. These substances are the major component for detoxification of heavy metals produced by various species of plants, fungi, algae and suspension cultures.

Electrochemical activity of <b>phytochelatins</b> originates mostly from sulfhydryl groups of amino acid cysteine.

Some {{of the main}} mechanisms involved in metal detoxification appear to involve the chelation of metal ions in the cytosol with thiol-containing compounds, such as glutathione, <b>phytochelatins,</b> or metallothioneins. We used an improved high-performance liquid chromatography method for the simultaneous measurement of thiol-containing compounds from cysteine and its derivatives ({gamma}-glutamylcysteine, glutathione) to higher-molecular-mass compounds (<b>phytochelatins).</b> We found that glutathione and {gamma}-glutamylcysteine contents increased when the ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus was exposed to cadmium.

The speciation of Cd and Pb complexes with <b>phytochelatins</b> has been studied in laboratory cultures of the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. An approach based on size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) with off-line detection of <b>phytochelatins,</b> by reverse-phase HPLC, and metal ion, by atomic absorption spectrometry, has been used. The formation of Cd- and Pb-PCn complexes with n-value from 3 to 6 was demonstrated. The metal-PCn complexes formed with Cd appear to be different from those formed with Pb for the number of molecules of peptide involved in the complex and for the amount of the metal ion bound. The chromatographic behaviour of metal-PCn complexes is consistent with Pb-PCn complexes in which only a molecule of peptide binds the metal ion, and with Cd-PCn complexes containing two or more molecules of peptide. The metal/peptide molar ratio in Cd-PCn complexes was higher that in Pb-PCn complexes. The formation of Cd- or Pb-PC 2 complexes was not demonstrated, probably for a dissociation during the cellular extract preparation.

50|$|Glutathione or its homologues, e.g. homoglutathione in Fabaceae; hydroxymethylglutathione in Poaceae are {{the major}} {{water-soluble}} non-protein thiol compounds present in plant tissue and account for 1-2% of the total sulfur. The content of glutathione in plant tissue ranges from 0.1 - 3 mM. Cysteine is the direct precursor for the synthesis of glutathione (and its homologues). First, γ-glutamylcysteine is synthesized from cysteine and glutamate catalyzed by gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase. Second, glutathione is synthesized from γ-glutamylcysteine and glycine (in glutathione homologues, β-alanine or serine) catalyzed by glutathione synthetase. Both steps of the synthesis of glutathione are ATP dependent reactions. Glutathione is maintained in the reduced form by an NADPH-dependent glutathione reductase and the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) generally exceeds a value of 7.Glutathione fulfils various roles in plant functioning. In sulfur metabolism it functions as reductant in the reduction of APS to sulfite. It is also the major transport form of reduced sulfur in plants. Roots likely largely depend for their reduced sulfur supply on shoot/root transfer of glutathione via the phloem, since the reduction of sulfur occurs predominantly in the chloroplast. Glutathione is {{directly involved in the}} reduction and assimilation of selenite into selenocysteine. Furthermore, glutathione is of great significance in the protection of plants against oxidative and environmental stress and it depresses/scavenges the formation of toxic reactive oxygen species, e.g. superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and lipid hydroperoxides. Glutathione functions as reductant in the enzymatic detoxification of reactive oxygen species in the glutathione-ascorbate cycle and as thiol buffer in the protection of proteins via direct reaction with reactive oxygen species or by the formation of mixed disulfides. The potential of glutathione as protectant is related to the pool size of glutathione, its redox state (GSH/GSSG ratio) and the activity of glutathione reductase. Glutathione is the precursor for the synthesis of phytochelatins, which are synthesized enzymatically by a constitutive <b>phytochelatin</b> synthase. The number of γ-glutamyl-cysteine residues in the phytochelatins may range from 2 - 5, sometimes up to 11. Despite the fact that the phytochelatins form complexes which a few heavy metals, viz. cadmium, it is assumed that these compounds play a role in heavy metal homeostasis and detoxification by buffering of the cytoplasmatic concentration of essential heavy metals. Glutathione is also involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics, compounds without direct nutritional value or significance in metabolism, which at too high levels may negatively affect plant functioning. Xenobiotics may be detoxified in conjugation reactions with glutathione catalyzed by glutathione S-transferase, which activity is constitutive; different xenobiotics may induce distinct isoforms of the enzyme. Glutathione S-transferases have great significance in herbicide detoxification and tolerance in agriculture and their induction by herbicide antidotes ('safeners') is the decisive step for the induction of herbicide tolerance in many crop plants. Under natural conditions glutathione S-transferases are assumed to have significance in the detoxification of lipid hydroperoxides, in the conjugation of endogenous metabolites, hormones and DNA degradation products, and in the transport of flavonoids.|$|E
