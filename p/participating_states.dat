5|$|Proposed in {{the form}} of an interstate compact, the {{agreement}} would go into effect among the <b>participating</b> <b>states</b> in the compact only after they collectively represent an absolute majority of votes (currently at least 270) in the Electoral College. In the next presidential election after adoption by the requisite number of states, the <b>participating</b> <b>states</b> would award all of their electoral votes to presidential electors associated with the candidate who wins the overall popular vote in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a result, the winner of the national popular vote would always win the presidency by always securing a majority of votes in the Electoral College. Until the compact's conditions are met, all states award electoral votes in their current manner.|$|E

25|$|Research {{conducted}} by the country's Instituto Nacional de Medicina Gen√≥mica (INMEGEN) has found that Mexico's Mestizo population is not uniform in its genetic composition, with there being significant regional variation. For example, mestizos of primarily European ancestry predominate in Sonora, while mestizos from the central region (Guanajuato and Zacatecas) have a more even split between indigenous and European. The highest African contribution in the twelve <b>participating</b> <b>states</b> (picked to {{be representative of the}} major regions of Mexico) was found in Guerrero and Veracruz, while the highest Asian contribution was found in Guerrero and Sonora.|$|E

25|$|Schwarzenegger signed another {{executive}} order on October 17, 2006, allowing California {{to work with}} the Northeast's Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. They plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by issuing a limited amount of carbon credits to each power plant in <b>participating</b> <b>states.</b> Any power plants that exceed emissions for the amount of carbon credits will have to purchase more credits to cover the difference. The plan took effect in 2009. In addition to using his political power to fight global warming, the governor has taken steps at his home to reduce his personal carbon footprint. Schwarzenegger has adapted one of his Hummers to run on hydrogen and another to run on biofuels. He has also installed solar panels to heat his home.|$|E
25|$|Article VII of the {{proposed}} constitution stipulated that only nine of the thirteen states would have to ratify for the new government {{to go into effect}} for the <b>participating</b> <b>states.</b> By the end of July 1788, eleven states had ratified the Constitution, and soon thereafter, the process of organizing the new government began. On September 13, 1788, the Articles Congress certified that the new Constitution had been ratified by more than enough states for it to go into effect. Congress fixed the city of New York as the temporary seat of the new government and set the dates for the election of representatives and presidential electors. It also set the date for operations to begin under the new government. This occurred on March 4, 1789, when the First Congress convened.|$|E
25|$|Montserrat was {{awaiting}} entrustment (approval) of the United Kingdom {{with regards}} to the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas in order to participate, but such entrustment was denied in mid-2008, and the CARICOM Heads of Government (including Montserrat) expressed disappointment and urged the United Kingdom to reconsider its position. Until such time, Montserrat remains a member under the conditions existing immediately prior to the coming into force of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas and the CSM on 1 January 2006 and as such is legally in a common market relationship with all CSM <b>participating</b> <b>states.</b> This means that while goods from Montserrat are eligible for CARICOM treatment and free trade (as covered under the old Common Market Annex), service providers in Montserrat are not eligible for CARICOM treatment unless so provided for by the various CSM countries individually in legislation or administratively.|$|E

500|$|ACA {{revised and}} {{expanded}} Medicaid eligibility starting in 2014. Under {{the law as}} written, all U.S. citizens and legal residents with income up to 133% of the poverty line, including adults without dependent children, would qualify for coverage in any state that participated in the Medicaid program. The federal government paid 100% {{of the cost of}} Medicaid eligibility expansion in <b>participating</b> <b>states</b> in 2014, 2015, and 2016; and will pay 95% in 2017, 94% in 2018, 93% in 2019, and 90% in 2020 and all subsequent years. The law provides a 5% [...] "income disregard", making the effective income eligibility limit for Medicaid 138% of the poverty level.|$|E
500|$|The compact would {{modify the}} way <b>participating</b> <b>states</b> {{implement}} [...] of the U.S. Constitution, which requires each state legislature {{to define a}} method to appoint its electors {{to vote in the}} Electoral College (although systems that violate the 14th Amendment, which mandates equal protection of law and prohibits racial discrimination, would be prohibited). The Constitution does not mandate any particular legislative scheme for selecting electors, and instead vests state legislatures with the exclusive power to choose how to allocate its own electors. States have chosen various methods of allocation over the years, with regular changes in the nation's early decades. Today, all but two states (Maine and Nebraska) award all their electoral votes to the candidate with the most votes statewide.|$|E

500|$|Margaret Thatcher's UK {{government}} {{was aware of}} the killings but remained silent on the matter, cautious not to anger Mugabe and threaten the safety of white Zimbabweans. The United States also did not raise strong objections, with President Ronald Reagan welcoming Mugabe to the White House in September 1983. In October 1983, Mugabe attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in New Delhi, where no <b>participating</b> <b>states</b> mentioned the Gukurahundi. In 2000, Mugabe acknowledged that the mass killings had happened, stating that it was [...] "an act of madness... it was wrong and both sides were to blame". Meredith argued however that Mugabe and his ZANU-PF were solely to blame for the massacres. Various Mugabe biographers have seen the Gukurahundi as a deliberate attempt to eliminate ZAPU and its support base in order to advance his desire for a ZANU-PF one-party state.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} SENSOR-Pesticides {{model was}} based on physician reporting. Each state contacted {{a select group of}} sentinel health care professionals on a regular basis to collect information. [...] However, this system was labor-intensive and did not yield many cases. [...] Because different states used different methods for collecting information, their data could not be compiled or compared to analyze for trends. [...] In response, NIOSH, along with other federal agencies (US EPA, National Center for Environmental Health), non-federal agencies (CSTE, Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics), and state health departments, developed a standard case definition and a set of standardized variables. [...] As of 2013, SENSOR-Pesticides had 12 <b>participating</b> <b>states</b> contributing occupational pesticide-related injury and illness data: [...] California, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, and Washington received federal funding to support surveillance activities, while Nebraska, New Mexico, Oregon, and Texas were unfunded SENSOR-Pesticides program partners.|$|E
