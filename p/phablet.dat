By comparison, the iPhone 5 sold 5 million units within its first three days of availability and the Galaxy S4 shipped 10 million units within its first month of availability. While not quoting any further numbers, Mark Woodward, president of HTC’s North American division, considered the HTC One’s launch {{to have been the}} most successful in the company’s history. In response to its success, HTC released two other HTC One-branded devices throughout 2013 that extended traits and design elements from the device into other form factors, including the mid-range HTC One Mini, and HTC One Max <b>phablet.</b>|$|E

Serving {{as a successor}} to 2012's Optimus G and the 2013 Optimus G Pro <b>phablet,</b> the G2 was unveiled at a press event in New York City on 7 August 2013, and first released in September 2013. The G2 is primarily distinguished by software features that LG billed would [...] "learn" [...] from users, a high fidelity sound system designed to produce higher quality audio, a [...] 1080p screen with technology that the company claimed would improve energy efficiency and {{reduce the size of}} the bezel around it, along with the unique placement of its power and volume keys—eschewing their typical location {{on the edge of a}} smartphone by placing them on the rear below the camera lens.|$|E
500|$|Wired {{reported}} that the iPhone 5 design, carried on in the iPhone 5S and iPhone SE, was regarded as [...] "long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general", while the succeeding iPhone 6/6S design was less critically acclaimed as it [...] "felt a little bit wrong, as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap". Wired described the iPhone 5 as [...] "elegance rooted {{in the way the}} aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from the iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone. Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, the iPhone 5 didn’t really look like anything else on the market at the time". However, the iPhone 5's design was not suited to scaling up, in contrast to the iPhone 6/6S which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6/6S Plus <b>phablet</b> models.|$|E

500|$|As of 2015–16, {{there were}} still a {{significant}} number of customers who preferred the 4-inch screen size of iPhone 5S, which remained the second-most popular iPhone after the iPhone 6 and ahead of the iPhone 6S. Apple stated in their event that they sold 30 million 4-inch iPhones in 2015, even as that form factor was succeeded as the flagship iPhone by the redesigned larger display 4.7/5.5-inch iPhone 6 and 6 Plus back in September 2014. Furthermore, the 5 and 5S design was regarded as [...] "long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general" [...] (with the 5S's gold finish adding a premium touch to the 5's already well-regarded look), while the succeeding 6 and 6S design was less critically acclaimed as it [...] "felt a little bit wrong, as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap".

Due to the market's growth, Reuters called 2013 the [...] "Year of the Phablet". In 2014, noting that <b>phablets</b> had overtaken laptops and desktops in global sales, The New York Times said [...] "phablets could become the dominant computing device of the futurethe most popular kind of phone on the market, and perhaps the only computer many of us need".|$|R

40|$|The smart mobile {{devices have}} {{emerged during the}} past decade and have {{become one of the most}} {{dominant}} consumer electronic products. Therefore, exploring and understanding the factors which can influence the acceptance of novel mobile technology have become the essential task for the vendors and distributors of mobile devices. The <b>Phablets,</b> integrated smart devices combining the functionality and characteristics of both tablet PCs and smart phones, have gradually become possible alternatives for smart phones. Therefore, predicting factors which can influence the acceptance of <b>Phablets</b> have become indispensable for designing, manufacturing, and marketing of such mobile devices. However, such predictions are not easy. Meanwhile, very few researches tried to study related issues. Consequently, the authors aim to explore and predict the intentions to use and use behaviors of <b>Phablets.</b> The second generation of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT 2) is introduced as a theoretic basis. The Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) based Network Process (DNP) will be used to construct the analytic framework. In light of the analytic results, the causal relationships being derived by the DEMATEL demonstrate the direct influence of the habit on other dimensions. Also, based on the influence weights being derived, the use intention, hedonic motivation, and performance expectancy are the most important dimensions. The analytic results can serve as a basis for concept developments, marketing strategy definitions, and new product designs of the future <b>Phablets.</b> The proposed analytic framework can also be used for predicting and analyzing consumers’ preferences toward future mobile devices...|$|R
