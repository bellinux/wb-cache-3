40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the skill of clay kneading in pottery. This task usually requires {{a few years to}} master and is therefore well suited to study the long-term development of a complex motor skill. Participants ’ kneading movements were measured in 3 D using a motion-capture device and phase relations among coordinates and joint angles were analyzed in terms of the mutual phase relative to a reference point using the Hilbert transform. While a certain degree of periodicity was observed in all ten participants, the behavior of the experts was characterized by a significant delay for the right elbow (i. e., the <b>pushing</b> <b>arm)</b> and the fore-aft position of the upper torso and only brief delays for the other parts, which all tended to synchronize with the reference. These findings are consistent with our notion of “differentiation within coordination”, according to which skill learning proceeds in a hierarchical manner in that coordination among limb movements is established first, followed by modulations of specific limb movements within the established coordination. Although this feature of expert behavior was also apparent in our previous studies of clay kneading and samba performances, the numbers of participants in those studies were not sufficient to dra...|$|E

50|$|Powered {{electric}} {{stair climbers}} {{are available in}} many variants, both in manufacture and mechanical operation, with the most common being <b>push</b> <b>arm</b> and walker variants due to size, speed and mobility.

50|$|A stairclimber {{is a type}} of trolley {{fitted with}} {{rotating}} wheels or tracks {{so that it can be}} pushed or pulled up or down steps or a stairway. Stairclimbers can be manual or battery-powered, and are commonly found in wheel, track, <b>push</b> <b>arm</b> or walker variants.|$|R
50|$|These {{machines}} are {{so big that}} they must be partially dismantled for shipment to most sites.

2500|$|Considered {{as a state}} machine, the {{turnstile}} has {{two possible}} states: Locked and Unlocked. [...] There are two possible inputs that affect its state: putting a coin in the slot (coin) and <b>pushing</b> the <b>arm</b> (<b>push).</b> [...] In the locked state, <b>pushing</b> on the <b>arm</b> has no effect; {{no matter how many}} times the input push is given, it stays in the locked state. [...] Putting a coin in – that is, giving the machine a coin input – shifts the state from Locked to Unlocked. [...] In the unlocked state, putting additional coins in has no effect; that is, giving additional coin inputs does not change the state. [...] However, a customer <b>pushing</b> through the <b>arms,</b> giving a <b>push</b> input, shifts the state back to Locked.|$|R
50|$|The {{device is}} usually {{composed}} of a fork or two <b>push</b> <b>arm</b> assemblies fitted {{to the front of}} a tank hull, with two banks of rollers that can be lowered in front of the tank's tracks. Each roller bank has several heavy wheels studded with short projecting steel girders, which apply a higher ground pressure than the tank's tracks. This ensures the explosion of pressure-fused anti-tank mines, which would otherwise explode under the track itself.|$|R
50|$|The <b>push</b> <b>arm</b> type {{stair climber}} have an arm fitted {{to the bottom}} of the truck that folds out and down, pushing on the step above and in so doing lifting the truck up in an arc to rest on that step. Repetitions of this {{movement}} allow the truck to move up the stairs. The mechanical opposite of this motion allows the unit move down stairs, many units also employ a forward only braking system to stop the stair climber rolling of the edge of a step. There a few notable variants of this type.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the relationship of muscular strength with swimming performance. For this purpose, fifteen muscular strength tests and thirteen swimming performance tests were administrated to 153 skilled college male swimmers. The findings are surmmarized as follows; 1) The dynamic strength which was measured by arm-pulls, sit-ups, and squat-jump showed significant correlation with most of swimming performance tests. However, the static strength which was measured by <b>push</b> <b>arm</b> strength, pull arm strength, abdominal strength, and leg strength (up-ward) did not show such correlation. 2) For the crawl stroke, the static strength which Was measured by back strength, grip strength, arm strength, and leg strength (down-Ward) showed no significant correlation with 200 m and/or 400 m swimming performance tests. Significant correlation between the static strength and performances, however, was found for such shorter distances as 25 m, 50 m, 100 m, and/or 200 m. Dynamic strength which was measured by arm-pulls, sit-ups, and squat-jump showed significant correlation with all swimming performance tests from 25 m to 400 m. 3) For the distance of 25 m, the following correlations were statistically significant: the performances in breast stroke with the records in back strength and <b>push</b> <b>arm</b> strength; those of back stroke with leg strength (down-ward) and squat jump; and those of butterfly stroke with squat jump. For the distance of 200 m, however, these correlations were not significant. 4) The performances in butterfly stroke showed significant correlation with sit-ups, arm-pulls, and squat-jump. The same performances, however, did not show any correlation with the static strength which wan measured by back strength, grip strength, <b>arm</b> strength, <b>push</b> <b>arm</b> strength, and leg strength. 5) In 25 m swimming performance tests, the sit-ups did not show significant correlation only with breast stroke, while the <b>push</b> <b>arm</b> strength and vertical jump showed significant correlation only with breast stroke. In 200 m swimming performance tests, the sit-ups did not show significant correlation only with breast stroke, while the vertical jump showed significant correlation only with breast stroke. 6) In 25 m swimming performance test, the arm strength and push-ups showed significant correlation only with crawl stroke. In 200 m swimming performance test, the arm strength, push-ups, and leg strength (down-ward) showed significant correlation only with crawl stroke. 7) The total amount of contribution of all the muscular strength tests to the swimming performance was found highest in the 25 m crawl arm pull (42. 1 %), and lowest in the 200 m breast stroke (17. 1 %). 8) In most of swimming performance tests, more than 70 % of total amount of contribution of all the muscular strength tests can be explained by less than half of all the test items experimented. 9) In case of 25 m breast stroke, 91. 4 % of total amount of contribution of all the muscular strength tests can be explained by five tests; grip strength (left hand), squat-jump, grip strength (right hand), vertical jump, and arm-pulls. In case of 400 m crawl stroke, 93. 0 % by six tests; arm-pulls, squat-jump, sit-ups, leg strength (up-ward), leg strength (down-ward), and arm strength (right hand) ...|$|R

50|$|The current conflict, {{in which}} the Chadian {{military}} is involved, is the civil war against Sudanese-backed rebels. Chad successfully manages to repel the rebel movements, but recently, with some losses (see Battle of N'Djamena (2008)). The army uses its artillery systems and tanks, but well-equipped insurgents have probably managed to destroy over 20 of Chad's 60 t-55 tanks, and probably shot down a Mi-24 Hind gunship, which bombed enemy positions near the border with Sudan. In November 2006 Libya supplied Chad with four Aermacchi SF.260W light attack planes. They are used to strike enemy positions by the Chadian Air Force, but one was shot down by rebels. During the last battle of N'Djamena gunships and tanks have been put to good use, <b>pushing</b> <b>armed</b> militia forces back from the Presidential palace.
