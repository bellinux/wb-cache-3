In Jule 2007 was approved by goverment decree N. 871 / 2007 document of Czechoffice for surveying, mapping and cadstre, that assesments deadline of cadstral maps digitalization in the year 2015. Financingof digitalization has to solve amendent of act N. 634 / 2004 Sb. of administrative charges. As interium solution offered COSMC Parcelorientation maps, that are free available on internet from March 2008. There are rastr images of {{cadastral map}}s in datum S-JTSKsuccesive complemented with parcel defonition points. One of reason insufficient rate of digitalization was uncertainty of reworkingtechnology of maps. These maps cover about 70 % territory of the Czech republic. From 1. 1. 2008 stands the new instruction, thatestablishs technology approach for cadastral map supersession.

Regularities of forming structure-ruptured layers on the surface of crystals A 322 V 1 B 332 VI 1 and Bi-Sb are first established, the mechanisms of influence of these layers and intermediate phases at the boundary surface of crystals of the mentioned systems with different contact alloys on thermoelectrical properties of the crystals, electrical (including electron work function) and adhesion <b>properties</b> of the <b>boundry</b> surface of the crystals with contact alloys are revealed. Physical bases are established and the technology is developed which introduction increases thermoelectrical efficiency of thermal elements by 20 %, reduces contact resistance by 2 - 3 times, increases the operating temperature up to 200 degrees C, prevents deterioration of parameters of thermoelectrical coolers andphotoreceiving devices based thereonAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
