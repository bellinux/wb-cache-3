We studied 1, 185 children within the BRISA cohort in São Luís, Maranhão State, Brazil. The food consumption was investigated using a 24 -hour recall, and the <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> caloric intake and nutrients were estimated by food groups according to “NOVA” classification. We chose to categorize children belonging to the upper tertile of the distribution as having a high consumption of processed and ultra-processed food products. The Poisson regression model with robust variance estimation using a hierarchical modeling approach was used to calculate the prevalence ratios (PRs) of variables associated with high consumption of processed and ultra-processed food products. The mean energy intake was 1, 226 Kcal/day. After adjustments, there was a higher proportion of high consumption of processed and ultra-processed food products among children whose mothers had < 12 years of education and among children who were older than 16 months. Mothers with low schooling and children older than 16 months should be the targets of interventions aimed at reducing consumption of these food products and preventing adverse health outcomes in later life...|$|E

METHOD Australian employees (n= 11; 46. 9 [9. 8] years; BMI 25. 9 [3. 5 kg/m(2) ]) wore an armband accelerometer for two consecutive working weeks (November-December 2010). In the second week, employees were encouraged to use a pod of four standing 'hot' desks to stand and work as often as possible. Desk use was recorded using time logs. The <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> work time spent in sedentary (3 METs) intensity categories were calculated for each week, relative to the total daily time at work. Paired sample t tests were used to compare weekly differences. RESULTS Employees spent 8 : 09 ± 0 : 31 h/day at work and 'hot' desk use ranged from zero to 9 : 35 h for the week. There were no significant changes in mean time spent in sedentary (difference of - 0. 1 %), light (difference of 0. 8 %) and moderate+ (- 0. 7 %) intensity categories. However, individual changes in sedentary work time ranged from - 5. 9 to 6. 4 %.

40|$|Objective: A {{number of}} {{efforts have been}} {{conducted}} on travel behavior and transport fatalities at the neighborhood or street level, and they have identified different factors such as roadway characteristics, personal indicators, and design indicators related to transport safety. However, {{only a limited number}} of studies have considered the relationship between travel behavior indicators and the number of transport fatalities at the city level. Therefore, this study explores this relationship and how to fill the mentioned gap in current knowledge. Method: A generalized linear model (GLM) estimates the relationships between different travel mode indicators (e. g., length of motorway per inhabitants, number of motorcycles per inhabitant, <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> trips on foot and by bicycle, <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> trips by public transport) and the number of passenger transport fatalities. Because this city-level model is developed using data sets from different cities all over the world, the impacts of gross domestic product (GDP) are also included in the model. Conclusions: Overall, the results imply that the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> trips by public transport, the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> trips on foot and by bicycle, and the GDP per inhabitant have negative relationships with the number of passenger transport fatalities, whereas motorway length and the number of motorcycles have positive relationships with the number of passenger transport fatalities...|$|R

Participants completed a 7 -day food diary at baseline, and objective measurements of height and weight were carried out at baseline and follow-up (1998 - 2000). Mean baseline body mass index (weight (kg) /height (m) (2)) was lowest among persons in the highest quintile <b>of</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> energy consumed at breakfast (mean values were 26. 0 in the highest quintile and 26. 3 in the lowest quintile), despite higher daily total energy intake in this group.

40|$|Due to {{the current}} {{scarcity}} of water, which may be aggravated by climate changes, {{it is important to}} develop cultivars tolerant to water stress. For this, information regarding the variability of the tolerance of cultivars to this stress is required. This information can be obtained by using phenotyping platforms, which allow a large-scale and automated assessment of crop traits related to productivity under water stress. This study took place in a greenhouse and used a phenotyping platform to evaluate some agronomic and physiological traits of two cotton cultivars with differing tolerances to this stress. The experiment was performed in a randomized block design, in a split-plot scheme with four replicates. The main plots were composed of five water regimes and the subplots of two cultivars, Acala SJ 2 and Auburn 2. The water regimes consisted of a well-irrigated treatment (daily replacement of 100 % of evapotranspired water) and four water restriction regimes (20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % of evapotranspired water at the well-irrigated treatment). The phenotyping platform and protocol (different <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> replacement of evapotranspired water) employed were suitable to the evaluated cotton cultivars for water-stress tolerance, and allowed the determination of the cultivar most tolerant (Acala SJ 2) and of the cultivar most sensitive (Auburn 2) to water stress. ‘Acala SJ 2 ’ displayed better physiological and agronomic traits in all water regimes, including higher root density in the upper soil layer, as well as higher water use than ‘Auburn 2 ’, which explained its higher seed yield under the conditions employed...|$|E

In the wild, this ability is likely constrained by seasonal food availability, limits of intake rate as body size increases, and competition. By visiting locations of 37 individuals during 274 bear-days, we documented foods consumed by grizzly (Ursus arctos) and black bears (Ursus americanus) in Grand Teton National Park during 2004 - 2006. Based on published nutritional data, we estimated foods and macronutrients as <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> energy intake. Using principal components and cluster analyses, we identified 14 daily diet types. Only 4 diets, accounting for 21 % of days, provided protein levels within the optimal range. Nine diets (75 % of days) led to over-consumption of protein, and 1 diet (3 % of days) led to under-consumption. Highest protein levels {{were associated with}} animal matter (i. e., insects, vertebrates), which accounted for 46 - 47 % of daily energy for both species. As predicted: 1) daily diets dominated by high-energy vertebrates were positively associated with grizzly bears and mean percent protein intake was positively associated with body mass; 2) diets dominated by low-protein fruits were positively associated with smaller-bodied black bears; and 3) mean protein was highest during spring, when high-energy plant foods were scarce, however it was also higher than optimal during summer and fall. Contrary to our prediction: 4) allopatric black bears did not exhibit food selection for high-energy foods similar to grizzly bears. Although optimal gain of body mass was typically constrained, bears usually opted for the energetically superior trade-off of consuming high-energy, high-protein foods. Given protein digestion efficiency similar to obligate carnivores, this choice likely supported mass gain, consistent with studies showing monthly increases in percent body fat among bears in this region...|$|E

Research design and methods: A randomized clinical trial was conducted on 60 patients with type 2 diabetes in pri-mary care — 19 with normoalbuminuria, 22 with microal-buminuria, and 19 with macroalbuminuria—. All patients experienced a screening phase during the 3 months, and were designated according to <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> caloric intake (e. g., carbohydrates 50 %, fat 30 %, and 20 % of pro-tein). After this period, they were randomly assigned to receive either LPD (0. 6 - 0. 8 g/kg per day) or normal protein diet (NPD) (1. 0 - 1. 2 g/kg per day) for a period of 4 months. Twenty nine patients received LPD and 31 received NPD. Primary endpoints included measures of renal function (UAER, serum creatinine and GFR) and glycemic control (fasting glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin A 1 c). Results: Renal function improved among patients with macroalbuminuria who received LPD: UAER decreased (1, 280. 7 ± 1, 139. 7 to 444. 4 ± 329. 8 mg/ 24 h; p < 0. 05) and GFR increased (56. 3 ± 29. 0 - 74. 2 ± 40. 4 ml/min; p < 0. 05).

Recently the Food and Drug Administration called for public comment on proposed changes to the program and solicited research related to the use and impact of the current label. In response to this request, a short consumer survey was conducted with 160 persons to see if they use the label, and, if so, which parts they use and their opinions about the usefulness of the current label. The majority of the respondents said they read the label most of the time before purchasing food, with 21 % stating they almost always do to. Parts of the label read most frequently were the calorie, fat, sugar, and fiber contents. <b>Percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> values were read less often, as were the health-related statements and the list of ingredients. Approximately half of those who consumed candy, bakery products, chips, or sodas-foods known to be high in calories-stated that they did not read the calorie content. Over two-thirds of the consumers felt confident that they understand how to read labels and said using a food label was better than relying on their own knowledge. However, the majority also though additional information about the label would be valuable. Most persons did not know the maximum calorie content of a low-calorie food, and stated that they would probably eat their favorite snack food even if it contained 400 calories per serving. Therefore, the calorie content of the food {{does not appear to have}} a major impact on the decision-making process.

40|$|Telica Volcano, Nicaragua, is a {{persistently}} restless volcano {{with high}} rates of seismicity that can vary from less than ten events to over a thousand events per day. Low-frequency (LF) events dominate the seismic catalogue and seismicity rates at Telica show little clear correlation with periods of eruption. As such, traditional methods of forecasting of volcanic activity based on increases in seismicity and recognition of LF activity are not applicable. A single seismic station has been operating at Telica since 1993, and in 2010 we installed a broadband seismic and continuous GPS network (TESAND network) at Telica. In this study we investigate the seismic characteristics surrounding a nine-month period of phreatic to phreatomagmatic explosions in 1999, and also from the initial three-and-a-half year deployment of the TESAND network, including a three-month phreatic vulcanian eruptive period in 2011. We demonstrate that pertinent information {{can be obtained from}} analysis of single-station data, and while large seismic networks are preferable when possible, we note that for many volcanoes this is not possible. We find unusual patterns of seismicity before both eruptive periods; rather than a precursory increase in seismicity as is observed prior to many volcanic eruptions, we observe a decrease in seismicity many months prior to eruption. We developed a new program for cross-correlation of large seismic data catalogues and analysed multiplet activity surrounding both eruptive periods. We observed that the formation of new multiplets corresponds to periods of high event rates (during inter-eruptive periods) and high <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> events that belong to a multiplet. We propose a model for the seismicity patterns observed at Telica, where changes in seismicity are related to a cyclic transition between open-system degassing and closed-system degassing. Periods of open-system degassing occur during non-eruptive episodes and are characterised by high event rates, a broad range of frequency content of events and high degrees of waveform correlation. A transition to closed-system degassing could be due to sealing of fluid pathways in the magmatic and/or hydrothermal system, or due to magma withdrawal. Periods of closed-system degassing are characterised by low event rates, higher frequency contents and low degrees of waveform correlation. Eruptive periods may then represent a transition from closed-system degassing to open-system degassing, however the system must also be capable of transitioning to open-system degassing without eruption. These observations have important implications for volcano monitoring and eruption forecasting at persistently restless volcanoes. Rather than a precursory increase in seismicity as is often observed prior to eruption at other volcanoes, our observations indicate that phreatic eruptions at Telica occur after a decrease in seismicity, a corresponding change in the frequency content of events, and a decrease in waveform correlation. These changes may represent a period of closed-system degassing that could culminate in phreatic eruptions. The inclusion of real-time analysis of variations in frequency content and multiplet activity provides critical information for volcano monitoring institutions...|$|E

40|$|Physical {{activity}} {{is thought to}} decline during childhood, but {{the extent of the}} decline is unknown. We made objective measures of 2 -year changes in physical activity and sedentary behavior in English children who participated in the Gateshead Millennium Study to explore the nature, timing, and extent of changes in physical activity and sedentary behavior before adolescence. We conducted a longitudinal study of 405 children (207 girls), aged 7 years, in 2006 / 2007 and again 24 months later. Physical activity and sedentary behavior were measured with the Actigraph GT 1 M accelerometer. Data were analyzed in 2010. Changes in total volume of physical activity (accelerometer counts per minute [cpm]), moderate-to-vigorous–intensity physical activity (MVPA), and sedentary behavior were quantified. Factors associated with changes in physical activity and sedentary behavior were tested by using linear regression. Tracking of physical activity and sedentary behavior over the 2 -year period was assessed by rank-order correlation. Mean <b>daily</b> volume <b>of</b> physical activity declined by 83 cpm (interquartile range [IQR]: − 189 to 31) over 2 years; the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> time spent in MVPA was low at baseline and declined by 0. 3 % (IQR: − 1. 4 to 0. 9). The <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> time in sedentary behavior was high at baseline and increased from 78. 0 % to 81. 1 % of the day (change 3. 1 % [IQR: − 0. 3 to 6. 0]). The decline in MVPA and increase in sedentary behavior were significantly greater in girls and in those with higher BMI z scores at baseline. Physical activity and sedentary behavior showed moderate tracking over the 2 -year period. We report here new evidence of low and declining levels of physical activity and MVPA and increasing sedentary behavior before adolescence...|$|R
40|$|Paid work {{is assumed}} to have a latent {{function}} of creating regular activity. This contribution investigates whether this regularity creating mechanism of paid work passes over to other activities as well. We introduce an indicator <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> routine {{that allows us to}} express what <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> time spent on different activities is done so every day at the exact same moment of time. When comparing the results for full-time employed (n= 695) and non-working (n= 971) samples for the workweek (Monday to Friday) we find that the former have a significant higher <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> routine that is mainly due to the regularity of paid work. As a result, this surplus of routine is found mainly during daytime, the period of the day that, vice versa, is the least routineous for the non-working. On the other hand, only activities directly related to paid work (i. e. personal care and travel) are done more routineous by the full-time employed compared to the non-working sample. The opposite holds for all other activities...|$|R

Dietary analysis (individual data not shown) revealed that participants derived a similar <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> average <b>daily</b> energy intake from carbohydrate, fat and protein. Thus, the contribution of differences in dietary composition can be considered to be minimal.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to determine if injection of recombinant chicken growth hormone (cGH) influences egg production parameters in older laying hens. In both experiments, hens were subjected to consecutive 3 -wk periods consisting of 1) a preinjection period, 2) an injection period, and 3) a postinfection period. During the 3 -wk injection period, hens were injected once daily with either 5, 50, or 500 Hg/kg BW of cGH or physiological saline (vehicle) alone (control group). In both experiments, injection of cGH did not affect (P>. 05) <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> egg production per hen, Haugh units, or BW during the injection period compared with preinjection hens. In Experiment 1, but not Experiment 2, control hens had reduced shell thickness and feed consumption during the injection and postinjection periods {{when compared with the}} preinjection controls. These reductions were not observed in hens receiving injections of cGH (all doses) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to observe the <b>daily</b> behavior <b>of</b> Timor deer (Cervus timorensis). The study was conducted in Aertembaga village, Bitung-North Sulawesi for 30 days. Deer were kept out in the conventional coconut plantations under extensive care system.   Seven Timor deers were used in this study. The daily behavior were observed for their activities; as grazing, ruminating, lying, urinating, defecating, vocalizing, working and other activities. A time sampling method was used to record the behavior activities and observations were repeated in five time.   The respective <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> activities <b>of</b> Timor deer for grazing, ruminating, lying, working, standing,   defecating,  urinating,  approaching  and other activities were 31. 17; 14. 63; 13. 54; 6. 23; 7. 55; 8. 51; 3. 96; 7. 915 and 6. 48 %.
