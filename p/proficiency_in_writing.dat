The next day the Bishop was taken to see a school founded by a rich Bengalee baboo, whom Mr. Corrie had almost persuaded to be a Christian, but who had settled down into a sort of general admiration for the beauty of the Gospel, and a wish to improve his countrymen. He had made over the house where the school was kept to the Church Missionary Society, and the staff consisted of an English schoolmaster, a Persian moonshee, and two Hindostanee writing masters, the whole presided over by an English catechist, a candidate for Holy Orders. There were several class rooms, and a large, lofty hall, supported by pillars, where the Bishop examined the 140, who read Persian and English, answered questions in Hindostanee and English, and showed great <b>proficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing,</b> arithmetic, and geography.

60|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the international position of China, some facts concerning its nineteenth-century history are indispensable. China was for many ages the supreme empire of the Far East, embracing a vast and fertile area, inhabited by an industrious and civilized people. Aristocracy, in our sense of the word, came to an end before the beginning of the Christian era, and government was in the hands of officials chosen for their <b>proficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> in a dead language, as in England. Intercourse with the West was spasmodic and chiefly religious. In the early centuries of the Christian era, Buddhism was imported from India, and some Chinese scholars penetrated to that country to master the theology of the new religion in its native home, but in later times the intervening barbarians made the journey practically impossible. Nestorian Christianity reached China in the seventh century, and had a good deal of influence, but died out again. (What is known on this subject is chiefly from the Nestorian monument discovered in Hsianfu in 1625.) In the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries Roman Catholic missionaries acquired considerable favour at Court, because of their astronomical knowledge and their help in rectifying the irregularities and confusions of the Chinese calendar.[24] Their globes and astrolabes are still to be seen on the walls of Peking. But in the long run they could not resist quarrels between different orders, and were almost completely excluded from both China and Japan.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{argue that}} it is {{important}} to bring <b>proficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>written</b> English language into the frame of a critical pedagogy for academic literacy. This may at first seem a counter-intuitive goal with connotations of constraint and convergence rather than opening up and diversity. However, what is often not taken into account in the notion of opening up new spaces of critique or new 'languages' is that those new critical 'languages' operate in a dominant materially concrete, linguistic language, namely English. The opportunity to manipulate the representational resources of English therefore is a necessary pedagogical goal if one wants to open up participation in academic literacy practices to a wider selection of people than is currently the case. By on the one hand, raising awareness of subjectification into the rhetorical norms of academic writing by pointing up their historical construction, and on the other, looking at an example of a Korean PhD student working with the theoretical discourses of post-colonialism and psychoanalysis in English, I hope to refigure the prevailing assumptions on attention to form <b>in</b> <b>written</b> English...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} Swedish students’ self-estimation {{regarding the}} <b>proficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> kanji characters. Various studies about Kanji exist, but investigations about writing are still limited. In addition, the study analyzed the respondent incorrect answers {{to see in}} which way they try to retrieve kanji characters. The theoretical framework is error analysis based on the cognitive model of kanji's three basic elements presented by Ivarsson (2016). As for the parameters which were utilized for analyzing incorrect answers, they {{were based on the}} work of Chikamatsu (2005). The Can-Do-Statements (CDS) questionnaire was based on Kano & Wei (2015) and the Tip-of-the-Pen (TOP) test based on Chikamatsu (2005). The CDS-questionnaire and TOP-test were conducted on a single occasion, but handed out separately. After the respondents had finished the Cds-test, they were allowed to begin the TOP-test. The Cds-test consisted of four questions regarding <b>proficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> kanji characters, but also asked which level of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) corresponded to their ability, and thus the research was able to divide the respondents into the two following groups: JLPT 3 and JLPT 2. The TOP-test consisted of forty-four words taken from Kanji Look and Learn (Banno et al., 2009) and the results of the TOP-test were compared to their estimations in order to conclude whether they had a tendency to overestimate, underestimate or could accurately estimate their abilities. The results indicated that the respondents had a tendency to overestimate their abilities in two out of four statements, namely writing daily kanji and various homophones. Furthermore, there also appeared to be a difference in retrieving kanji characters between the JLPT 3 group and JLPT 2 group...|$|E

Linguist like Brown (2004), most linguists agree with in an ESL/EFL academic English program, {{the objective of}} the curriculum should not be limited to only the linguistic component alone but should also include developing the art of critical thinking. In view of that, the aim {{of this study is to}} understand and explore the relationship between English language <b>proficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> and critical thinking dispositions. The California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI) was used to determine the critical thinking disposition score. The English language <b>proficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> was measured through the research essay assignment which was graded through the holistic grading scheme for writing from a preparatory college. This study involved 138 students. The study aims to achieve three objectives. The first objective was to investigate the critical thinking dispositions profile of students with high, average and low English in their writing. The results showed that for each essay score category (high, average and low), most of the students have ambivalent CCTDI score. The second objective of the study is to examine the extent to which writing correlates with the seven scales of the critical thinking disposition: analyticity, truth-seeking, systematicity, maturity, inquisitiveness, open-mindedness and CT self confidence. It was found that, there were two disposition scales that correlates with the students writing score. These scales are: inquisitiveness and maturity. The third objective is to look at the transition words that students use in their writing when managing the content of their writing. The study found that students with ambivalent score in CCTDI used more transition phrases compared to students with low CCTDI score. Implications in ESL studies were discussed...|$|E
40|$|Writing is {{a complex}} process that {{transforms}} writers ’ thought into texts. <b>Proficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> is always one of essential purposes in language learning.

Our study considers their <b>proficiencies</b> <b>in</b> majority language (German) {{as well as in}} their family languages. Given that in most cases systematic educational support is warranted for majority language only, we assume marginal effects of familial linguistic input on the child's performance in majority language but substantial effects on family language proficiencies. We differentiate between quantitative and qualitative input aspects and include additional social and educational variables that are supposed to interfere with the relation between linguistic input and language proficiencies. The study is based on cross-sectional data collected in a pilot study, including Russian-German, Turkish-German and Vietnamese-German children in northern Germany. We computed nested OLS-regression models to examine the hypothesized relations. Results indicate that effects of familial quantitative input in German decrease when controlled for duration of contact with the majority language and for type of school the children attend. We discuss these factors mainly as indicators for external linguistic input. On the other hand we find support for the hypothesis that the quality of familial input in the family language has significant effect on the child's <b>writing</b> <b>proficiencies</b> <b>in</b> this language.
