40|$|Prestressing cables {{are widely}} used in huge constructions like {{buildings}} and bridges. Corrosion of prestressing steel is more dangerous than the corrosion of reinforcing steel in concrete. Stress corrosion is propagated due to corrosion initiation in prestressing steel under stressed condition. Corrosion resistance of the prestressing steel depends upon the grout material. In this investigation three types of grout materials namely cement grout with non-shrinking admixture, polyurethane foam and epoxy grout were assessed for its suitability within the <b>prestressing</b> <b>cable</b> duct. The performance of grout materials to protect against prestressing steel corrosion was evaluated by different electrochemical techniques such as OCP measurements, anodic polarisation test and impressed voltage technique. The mechanical property of the different grout materials were test at room and elevated temperature. Among the three grouts, epoxy based grout system showed better corrosion resistance properties...|$|E

30|$|The {{results of}} the most {{relevant}} experimental investigations (Saiidi et al. 1994; Kim et al. 2010; Zhang 2007; Jang et al. 2010) are summed up in Figs. 1 and 2. These investigations have been selected from those mentioned above as they are related to tests on reinforced concrete elements and {{in the interest of}} data completeness, reported in the source papers. In the graphs, ratios between vibration frequency of prestressed beam f_p and that of the non-prestressed beams f_ 0 are plotted against the ratios between prestressing force P and the nominal compression strength N_u of the concrete cross-section for the first two frequencies of vibration. The ratio between the tendon eccentricity and the height of the beam is also demonstrated. Some general trends can be extracted from these figures. Firstly, it can be stated that for low levels of prestressing force, a prestress increase produces an increase in eigenfrequencies, especially for fundamental frequency of vibration. For higher values of the prestressing force the rate of increase of eigenfrequencies tends to decrease. Furthermore, it can be observed that variations in frequencies of vibrations are higher for smaller values of the <b>prestressing</b> <b>cable</b> eccentricity.|$|E

A comprehensive programme of experiments and numerical modelling was performed, the results of which were combined to develop resistance expressions {{for the design of}} prestressed high strength steel members. A total of 12 tensile and 10 compressive member tests were carried out, with the key variables examined being the steel grade (S 460 and S 690), the initial prestress level and the presence of grout. Numerical models were developed to replicate the structural response of the compressive member tests and subsequently used to generate parametric results, where the member slenderness, size of <b>prestressing</b> <b>cable,</b> applied prestress level, steel grade (S 460 or S 690), and grout condition (grouted and non-grouted), were varied.

40|$|Today’s bridge {{design work}} {{in many cases}} demands a {{trustworthy}} dynamic analysis instead of using the traditional dynamic amplification factors. In this thesis a reliable 3 D Bernoulli-Euler beam finite element model of the New Årsta Railway Bridge was prepared for thorough dynamic analysis using in situ bridge monitoring for correlation. The bridge is of the concrete box girder type with a heavily reinforced and prestressed bridge deck. The monitoring system was designed for long term monitoring with strain transducers embedded in the concrete and accelerometers mounted inside the edge beams and at the lower edge of the track slab. The global finite element model used the exact bridge geometry but was simplified regarding <b>prestressing</b> <b>cables</b> and the two railway tracks. The <b>prestressing</b> <b>cables</b> and the tracks were consequently not included and an equivalent pure concrete model was identified. A static macadam train load was eccentrically placed {{on one of the}} bridge’s two tracks. By using Vlasov’s torsional theory and thereby including constrained warping a realistic modulus of elasticity for the concrete without <b>prestressing</b> <b>cables</b> and stiffness contribution from the railway tracks was found. This was allowed by comparing measured strain from strain transducers with the linear elastic finite element model’s axial stresses. Mainly three monitoring bridge sections were used, each of which was modelled with plane strain finite elements subjected to sectional forces/moments from a static macadam train load and a separately calculated torsional curvature. From the identified modulus of elasticity the global finite element model was updated for Poisson’s ratio and material density (mass) to correspond with natural frequencies from the performed signal analysis of accelerometer signals. The influence of warping on the natural frequencies of the global finite element model was assumed small and the bridge’s torsional behaviour was modelled to follow Saint-Venant’s torsional theory. A first preliminary estimation of modal damping ratios was included. The results indicated that natural frequencies were in accordance between modelling and signal analysis results, especially concerning high energy modes. Estimated damping ratios for the first vibration modes far exceeded the lower limit value specified in bridge design codes and railway bridge dynamic analysis recommendations. QC 2010112...|$|R

40|$|The time {{dependent}} behaviour of composite beams prestressed {{by external}} cables is analysed by assuming linear elastic behaviour for the steel and the interface shear connection, {{linear viscoelastic behaviour}} for the concrete and the hypothesis of frictionless cables.

40|$|In {{the present}} dissertation, {{displacement}} control systems for large span structures using cablenets are herein proposed. The system {{is based on}} cable supported beam nets with additional prestressing control of the support cables such as to optimize the structural behavior of the system: the passive control design problem leads to an optimal control problem for structures governed by variational inequalities. The optimal shape of a <b>prestressing</b> support <b>cable</b> in many cases leads to a Form-Finding problem of the structure. The analysis {{is based on the}} two-nodes-curved-cable-element where large displacements and large rotations occur. Therefore, a multi-span cable is a non-linear and flexible structure since every loading case defines a new equilibrium configuration for the system. Using a prestressing strategy, the configuration of the cable structure due to the permanent loading is final. The novel passive control system is based on <b>prestressing</b> <b>cables</b> mechanism where permanent loads are relieved by a first level <b>prestressing</b> <b>cables</b> set named (a) and moving loads together with excessive displacements are taken by an additional cablenet (b) depending on the form {{and the use of the}} structure. Several variations of these passive control systems using <b>prestressing</b> <b>cables</b> are herein proposed: 1) A combination of a horizontal straight beams and external <b>prestressing</b> supported <b>cable</b> connecting with vertical rods where sliding contacts occur between rods and the cable. 2) A set of cables named (β) is used. This set has the same form with the cables of set (α), they also fastened at the same points while freely sliding bearings are used as connection joints with the vertical rods of the structure. The peculiarity of the cables of the latter set in that they are not homogenous. They are composed of n number of initially prestressed rods surrounded with the cracked unilateral stiffness rod elements with different initial prestresses at each face of the polygonal line. The prestressed cable elements are connected with nonprestressed of small length cable elements of the same set (β), where are not activated during permanent loading because of the set (α) supported cables, but is only activated under the moving loading action. 3) A prestress strategy when set (α) cables supported a horizontal straight beam structure, such as the reactions of the cable at the sliding contacts with the vertical rods due to prestress are bigger than the action forces of the permanent loading at the upper side of the same vertical rods. The result of this strategy is a new equilibrium configuration of the beam structure in opposite direction of the moving loading action. 4) The unilateral Form-Finding of arch beam structures using cable configuration due to the nodal permanent loading, but with negative shape form. 5) Introduction of diagonal cable element with no contact at the middle of their length, to connect nodes of the upper beam structure and the corresponding (in diagonal direction) node of the set (α) cable. The diagonal cables are not prestressed, but in the case of moving loading action the one them is stretched and the other has no action due to no press occur in cable elements. 6) The use of small displacements at the moving end of beam or arch structure supported with set (α) cable, due to moving loading action. 7) In floating bodies model, the compulsion overtopping of natural waterline of the body by the use of stable anchorage to the bottom by four prestressed cable (or chain) elements. 8) A combination between several of the above systems to the same model. The proposed models for large space structures with several passive systems on it, such as the above eight cases, aim with the purpose to minimize the effects of moving loading action. In any case the proposed model has been fully numerically examined, by the use (2 -D) or (3 -D) linear and non-linear finite element models. Many examples of them are bridge structures with several free length spans and with different passive control systems of displacements against moving loads according DIN 1072 & Eurocode- 1. In the case of (3 -D) models some of the examples have been checked successfully with wind loading models. Additionally checks with excellent results gave the basic examples for bridge structures against seismic action with dynamic spectra analysis according Greek National Rules. The study presents new techniques for the design and construction of large span structures (such as bridges, long cover structures and as an extension of the passive prestress control method using cables and applications on floating bodies and structures). The scope of this work is to develop new models of large space structures where unilateral conditions occur minimizing moments action and respectively the necessary sections of the structural members. These type of structure minimize the seismic action on the bridge. The proposed models of large span structures lead to a safer and more economical method of construction with small disturbance to the natural environment. ...|$|R
