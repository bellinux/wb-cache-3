5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the accident, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) issued an Airworthiness Directive ordering all DC-6 and DC-6B aircraft to be fitted with a manual device which could prevent the inadvertent reversal of the <b>propeller</b> <b>blades.</b> United Airlines also stated they had begun installing reverse thrust indicator lights in the cockpits of their DC-6 aircraft, which would warn pilots when a propeller had reversed.|$|E
5|$|The German {{heavy cruiser}} , ship #36, survived both the Able and Baker tests but was too {{radioactive}} to have leaks repaired. In September 1946 she was towed to Kwajalein Atoll, where she capsized {{in shallow water}} on December 22, 1946, five months after Baker. She remains there today, with starboard <b>propeller</b> <b>blades</b> in the air.|$|E
5|$|The Douglas Aircraft Company {{designed}} {{a system that}} would prevent the accidental reversal of <b>propeller</b> <b>blades</b> in-flight. During development of the DC-6, the company installed a system that cut electrical power to the mechanisms which rotated the blades while the airplane was in the air. When there was enough weight on the landing gear (which would only be the case when the aircraft was on the ground), a switch which supplied electrical power to the mechanisms was closedmeaning that when the aircraft touched down the blades could be reversed and thus the airplane could be slowed. When the switch was closed, a red flag would swing into view in the cockpit of the aircraft, warning the crew that the blades could be reversed. Should the switch fail to close upon landing, the flag could be raised manually and electrical power to the mechanisms would be restored. When the aircraft took off, electrical power would be cut to the mechanisms so that the <b>propeller</b> <b>blades</b> could not be inadvertently reversed, and the red flag swung out of sight. Reverse thrust warning lamps, which would have warned the crew if the propellers were reversed, were not fitted on Mainliner Idaho.|$|E
50|$|In June 2004, a Tutor lost a <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> and its canopy in flight. The {{aircraft}} was landed unpowered in a field, where damage was also sustained to the undercarriage. Subsequent investigation revealed cracking in the <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> roots across the fleet, which was grounded for modifications. No-one {{was injured in}} the incident.|$|R
40|$|The {{first report}} showed the {{difficulty}} {{to consider the}} small material defects and the low fluctuating stress by the hydrodynamic force as the main factors of the <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> failure. For {{the purpose of the}} elucidation of resonance between vibrations of the propeller shaft and the <b>propeller</b> <b>blade,</b> this paper presents the measurements and calculations of the flexural natural frequency of the full scale <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> in. air and in water, the vibratory stress due to the resonance and the life of the fatigue failure. It is shown that there is a fair possibility for the high vibratory stress of about 60 N/mm 2 to affect the early blade failure...|$|R

5|$|They {{were also}} able to {{determine}} all of the flight control surfaces, including the elevators, ailerons and rudder, were functioning properly {{at the point of}} the crash, and there were no faults in the flight control system. The flaps were extended to between 15° and 20°, the standard setting for take-off. The <b>propeller</b> <b>blades</b> of No. 4 engine on the far right side of the aircraftwere reversedminus 8°, while the blades of Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines were at 34° positive pitch (also standard for take-off).|$|E
5|$|Renown {{was laid}} down at Pembroke Dockyard on 1 February 1893 and {{launched}} on 8 May 1895. She {{was completed in}} January 1897 {{at a cost of}} £751,206, but then underwent lengthy sea trials that included the changing of her <b>propeller</b> <b>blades</b> that lasted until June. The ship commissioned on 8 June 1897 and served as flagship for the Commander-in-Chief, Vice Admiral Sir Nowell Salmon, VC, on 26 June, at the Fleet Review at Spithead for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria, with the Prince of Wales aboard. She was briefly attached to the 1st Division, of the Channel Squadron, from 7 to 12 July for manoeuvres off the south coast of Ireland. On 24 August, Renown became Fisher's flagship, relieving the protected cruiser Crescent as flagship of the North America and West Indies Station. The ship continued as such until beginning a refit in May 1899.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation found}} a {{simulated engine failure}} procedure was being conducted, which involved {{a member of the}} crew pulling back the throttle lever for engine No. 4 prior to taking off. Investigators found that if the throttle lever was pulled back too far, it would cause the propeller to reversea feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing. Once the landing gear was raised, the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the <b>propeller</b> <b>blades</b> back into the correct position, since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. 4 engine, thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank. Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not raised, that increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine, causing the DC-6 to spiral out of control. Since the plane was so close to the ground, the suddenness of the bank and dive meant the flight crew had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>propeller</b> <b>blade's</b> [...] "lift", or its thrust, {{depends on}} the angle of attack {{combined}} with its speed. Because the velocity of a <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> varies from the hub to the tip, it is of twisted form {{in order for the}} thrust to remain approximately constant {{along the length of the}} blade; this is called washout. This is typical of all but the crudest propellers.|$|R
2500|$|After being {{informed}} of the accident, seven officials of the French aviation accident investigation agency Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile arrived at the accident site {{the next day at}} 17:00 h. The investigation lasted almost eight months; the final report was released on 16 March 16, 1954, stating the cause of the accident as [...] "the failure of a <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> resulting in the separation of the No.3 engine from the aircraft, and loss of control of the No.4 engine. The cause of the <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> fracture could not be determined."

5|$|The {{wreck of}} the Avenger torpedo bomber shot down in the {{operation}} was located off Fagervika {{with the help of}} local Norwegians in 1987, and partially salvaged by the Royal Norwegian Navy. The remains of two of the airmen killed in the operation were recovered from the sea. A memorial in the honour of the airmen killed in the operation was erected at the former site of a German coastal artillery position at Fagervika. The memorial was dedicated on 4 October 1987 in the presence of American diplomat Richard Norland, naval attaché Lieutenant Commander Robert B. Murrett, and relatives of one of the airmen killed in Operation Leader. Included in the memorial is one of the three <b>propeller</b> <b>blades</b> recovered from the Avenger wreck, the other two blades being displayed at the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Florida and at the Norwegian Home Guard base in Søvik, near Sandnessjøen, respectively. The memorial at Fagervika has been used as the site of remembrance ceremonies organized by the Norwegian Reserve Officers' Federation and with the participation of American veterans of Operation Leader.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Marine {{propeller}} {{is a kind}} {{of typical}} part with free-form surface. The surface shape of <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> is very complex, {{and it is difficult to}} be described by general mathematical expressions, so that the modeling of propeller is very cumbersome and error-prone. To solve this problem, firstly, three-dimensional point data of <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> is calculated by VC/MFC programming technology and access technology of database based on projection principle of <b>propeller</b> <b>blade.</b> And then, automation and parameterization of solid modeling for propeller of different map forms are realized by programming with the interactive programming language of UG/Open Grip based on UG software. The parametric modeling system provides accurate three-dimensional model for automatic programming, dynamic simulation and numerical analysis of propeller, and improves the design efficiency of systematic propeller, and has very good practical value...|$|R
50|$|The {{probable}} {{cause of the}} accident {{was determined to be}} the failure of the propeller due to undiscovered metal fatigue in one blade resulting from corrosion from chlorine. There had been two previous failures of the same type of propeller, but those aircraft had been able to land safely. The failed <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> had undergone scheduled ultrasonic testing on May 19, 1994, which resulted in its rejection and removal from the <b>propeller.</b> The <b>blade</b> was sent to a Hamilton Standard facility, where it was subject to refurbishing work that was incorrectly performed. The <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> was then installed on the propeller fitted to the aircraft on September 30, 1994.|$|R

25|$|There {{was never}} any formal salvage of the site. However, since the {{invention}} of recreational SCUBA diving in the 1960s, looters have been frequenting the site and noticeable materials have been removed. Such materials that have been targeted are non-ferrous materials, such as copper alloy piping off the boilers and any interesting personal artefacts. Looters have also used explosives on the site, including destroying the <b>propeller</b> <b>blades.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{winter of}} 1890–1891 was mild, so Murtaja could not {{demonstrate}} her icebreaking capabilities to their full extent. However, she lost {{a large number}} of cast iron <b>propeller</b> <b>blades</b> and while the replacement blades could be installed at sea by trimming the vessel so that the propeller shaft was near the water surface, the heavy task took several days. For this reason the Helsinki Polytechnics later developed more durable steel blades that were also used in the subsequent icebreakers.|$|E
40|$|Throughout {{the life}} cycle of an aircraft, it is likely that it may {{encounter}} an uncontained engine rotor or <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> failure due to probable malfunction or failure of single or multiple engine components, inadequate rotor and casing design, fatigue, material imperfections, assembly errors and foreign object ingestion. Uncontained engine rotor or <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> failure can lead to catastrophic failure if not addressed adequately during design. To ensure safety of the flight in the event of rotor burst or <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> failure federal aviation regulations has set forth compliance requirements (FAR sections 25. 903, 25. 905. d) which states that the airplane must be capable of successfully completing a flight during which likely structural damage occurs {{as a result of a}} <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> impact, uncontained fan blade impact, uncontained engine rotor failure or uncontained high energy rotating machinery failure. Aircraft manufactures has to comply with the safety requirements mentioned above. Hence it is required to assess the risk, take adequate design measures to minimize the risk and show compliance by analysis or test that the damage caused is minimal and aircraft is capable of completing safe flight in the event of uncontained rotor failure. This paper demonstrates the methodology to be followed for performing safety assessment of a typical light transport aircraft (LTA) in the event of an uncontained rotor burst and <b>propeller</b> <b>blade</b> failure. Assessment method presented in this paper is generic in nature and can be used to assess the safety of any class of transport aircraft. ...|$|R
