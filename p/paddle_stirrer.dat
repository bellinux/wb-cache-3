40|$|A {{simplified}} method to study native phosphocaseinate dissolution was developed. The method involved dispersing powder in distilled water {{at a constant}} shear rate.

The definitive article is available at: [URL] emulsification of unrefined pumpkin seed oil was performed using microengineered flat disc membranes on top of which a <b>paddle</b> blade <b>stirrer</b> was operated to induce surface shear. The membranes used were fabricated by galvanic deposition of nickel onto a photolithographic template and contained hexagonal arrays of uniform cylindrical pores with a diameter of 19 or 40 mu m and a pore spacing of 140 mu m. The uniformly sized pumpkin seed oil drops with span values less than 0. 4 were obtained at oil fluxes up to 640 L m(- 2) h(- 1) using 2 wt. % Tween 20 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate) or 2 - 10 wt. % Pluronic F- 68 (polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylen copolymer) as an aqueous surfactant solution. Pumpkin seed oil is rich in surface active ingredients that can be adsorbed on the membrane surface, such as free fatty acids, phospholipids, and chlorophyll. The adsorption of these components on the membrane surface gradually led to membrane wetting by the oil phase and the formation of uniform drops was achieved only for dispersed phase contents less than 10 vol. % At high oil fluxes, Pluronic F- 68 molecules present at a concentration of 2 wt. % could not adsorb fast enough, on the newly formed oil drops, to stabilise the expanding inter-face.

In the extreme case of a diffusive medium (e. g., Rayleigh channels), the fluctuations intensity is unaltered. The predictions of the proposed theoretical models are validated against experimental results measured in a reverberation chamber, where a mechanical <b>paddle</b> (<b>stirrer)</b> acts as the source of perturbation in the medium.

40|$|In this study, the {{evaluation}} of chamber effects on antenna efficiency measurements using non-reference antenna (NRA) methods is presented. Two reverberation chambers have been employed and they differ in dimensions and <b>paddle</b> <b>stirrer</b> configurations, therefore the corresponding electrical characteristics such as quality factors, decay constants, and enhanced backscatter coefficients are envisaged to be different. However, {{it is found that}} these differences have little influence on the efficiency measurement of antennas-under-test (AUTs). The AUTs used for this study were a directional antenna and an omnidirectional antenna. The discrepancy in the efficiency of the two antennas measured between the two chambers is < 10 % within their operational frequency bands. These results demonstrate that the NRA measurement techniques are robust. Further investigation shows that the directional antenna is slightly more prone to polarisation mismatch than the omnidirectional antenna is. Therefore, polarisation stirring should be implemented when using the NRA methods for antenna efficiency measurement especially for directional antennas...|$|E

The yield and characteristics of the device-associated fermentation was contrast with features from fermentation simulating indigenous practices using a wooden spoon stirrer. Contrasting features include continuous aeration with the device-associated system that ensured frequent microbe-substrate contact, higher percentage yield of starch and a short time to result (7 days versus 15 days with the wooden spoon stirrer). The wooden spoon stirrer system only permitted occasional agitation, yielded less starch but produced more quantity of protein-rich fermented rice granules. Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts were dominant fermentative flora and flourished at pH 3. 5 to 4. 5. The mechanical device consists of a long beam which furcated into five prongs. The prongs are made of two arms which bifurcate and a third arm that runs vertically from the base. The paddles are spade-like in shape with circular blunt ends.

40|$|To {{ease the}} process of sieving {{for the purpose of}} obtaining {{homogeneous}} size populations of human serum albumin microspheres, a tech nique was developed that uses sonification of a suspension of microspheres while sieving. This has resulted in populations of microspheres that are almost totally encompassed by the de. sired size range with little to no outsize con tamination. Measurement of the microspheres was accom plished by photographing the microspheres and a stage micrometer on the same roll of film and at the same magnification. The print of the micrometer was then used to measure the micro sphere sizes on the other prints. The value of microspheres of human serum albu mm {{for the study of the}} circulation and arteriovenous shunts is well documented (1 â€” 4).

This is illustrated using a <b>paddle</b> <b>stirrer</b> positioned above flat disc membranes with regular arrays of pores of 20 μm diameter and spacing between the pores of 80 and 200 μm. In the former case an additional mechanism for drop detachment is the push-off force, which is determined by the geometry of the drops as they deform at the membrane surface. When dispersing sunflower oil in to aqueous solutions containing Tween 20, drop sizes between 60 and 200 μm were produced, {{and in the case of}} the membrane when the push-off force was working the Coefficient of Variation of the drops formed was below 10 %. The push-off force may be added to the shear-drag force to predict drop detachment. For the 200 μm pore spaced membrane this force is much less prominent than the 80 μm spaced membrane. The capillary-shear model has been modified to include this push-off force. The experimental study required the use of very low dispersed phase injection rates as well as very high rates. Hence, two different types of pumps were used to provide these: a peristaltic and syringe pumps.

40|$|Physical-chemical {{treatment}} of liquid wastes is becoming widespread. One promising physical treatment process is contaminant adsorption on activated carbon. Units are frequently operated with {{the inclusion of}} carbon reactivation or' regeneration. In order to design adsorption processes both the kinetics of removal {{and the effects of}} regeneration require quantification. This study was conducted to establish the kinetics of phenol removal in non-flow, well-mixed reactors where cocoanut charcoal was the adsorbent. The batch system consisted of a Phipps-Bird six place <b>paddle</b> <b>stirrer</b> run at 162 RPM. Reactor volumes were 1000 ml and fluid volumes were 900 ml. Reactors were buffered to pH of 6. 8 to 7. 0. Phenol was measured by light absorbance on a Beckman DBG spectrophotometer. Removal rate was found to follow a film diffusion limitation description, where concentration gradient across the proposed film was the driving force. Effective concentration at the surface of the particle was calculated by applying the isotherm equation of Weber and Morris, for which the parameters were established for the system studied. The proportionality between driving gradient and removal rate was determined. When the ratio of phenol to carbon was in excess of approximately 40 mg/gm intraparticle diffusion limitation was indicated. Regeneration effects on carbon were studied in four phases. The first phase established, for a single high temperature regeneration of carbon, initially loaded to 1 % by weight, that uptake rate was decreased upon redose, relative to virgin carbon. The second phase showed that virgin carbon at equilibrium with the atmosphere underwent mass loss and eventual destruction at regeneration temperatures of 550 °C and 950 °C, whereas, at 170 °C, mass loss stabilized at 3 %. The third phase separated, partially, the mechanisms operative in capacity change during regeneration at a single temperature (550 °C). The final phase of the regeneration study established, for the temperatures and loadings studied, the desirability of high temperature of regeneration and heavy loading of the carbon prior to regeneration. More capacity was recovered, and carbon destruction was retarded, when the carbon was initially heavily loaded and the regeneration temperature was the highest studied...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary focus}} of this thesis is to {{evaluate}} the use of the enhanced backscatter coefficient as a quantity for characterizing the spatial uniformity of the reverberation chamber (RC). An RC is a statistical measurement facility constructed from a large metallic hallow cavity containing an irregularly shaped <b>paddle</b> <b>stirrer</b> for mixing electromagnetic fields to obtain many statistically independent samples. The average power, measured from antennas placed inside of the RC, is ideally uniform over any chosen antenna position and orientation within the RCs working volume. Spatial uniformity is a fundamental assumption to all RC theoretical analysis, and thus the spatial dependence of the RC {{is directly related to the}} uncertainty of the measurements. Comparisons are made with standard multiple-configuration measurements (different antenna positions) to show that comparable values of standard deviation caused by spatial non-uniformity are obtained using the transfer function (as typically used) and the enhanced backscatter coefficient. Additionally, it is shown that the enhanced backscatter coefficient for an ideal RC is theoretically a constant value of 2, but has variation over frequency when measured. This variation over frequency is used in a single-configuration measurement to obtain values of standard deviation that are nearly the same as those found using multiple-configuration measurements. This is possible because the statistical variation of the reverberation chamber is similar over frequency and over different measurement positions. Furthermore, data is presented from various tests showing that the value of the enhanced backscatter coefficient is sensitive to calibration issues, and the improper use of frequency stirring. This helps to justify that the enhanced backscatter coefficient can be used as a benchmark quantity for determining if computations from the RC measured data are useful and can be trusted. One- and two-dimensional Greens function models are also used to explore the enhanced backscatter coefficient value for different types of stirring mechanisms. Lastly, application of the enhanced backscatter coefficient for determining the total efficiency of an antenna measured in the reverberation chamber is presented. Along with the estimates of total efficiency, the confidence interval of the results is computed from the frequency variation of the enhanced backscatter coefficient...|$|E
40|$|Meloxicam is {{practically}} {{insoluble in water}} and its dissolution is the rate-limiting step for its absorption, which leads variable bioavailability. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to enhance the dissolution rate of Meloxicam by formation of microcrystals using solvent change method. Improved bioavailability is an added advantage for most of the poorly soluble drugs in water. In recent years research work is concentrated on various methods to improve the solubility characteristics of poorly soluble drugs and crystallization phenomenon is one among them. The solubility problem can be solved by changing the crystal habit of drug, which improves the solubility and dissolution. Crystallization is also a purification process to remove the impurities from pharmaceutical products by, recrystallization technique. So, in the present investigation an attempt has been made to improve the solubility characteristics of Meloxicam (NSAID’s) using crystallization method by solvent evaporation technique. To increase the therapeutic efficiency and quality of existing marketed dosage formulations. In this method, crystallization takes places mainly due to the removal of solvent by evaporation and reprecipitation in water in which drug is insoluble. The biphasic layer formed due to water immiscible solvent and is evaporated by maintaining the temperature above to corresponding boiling point of solvents. In our work three immiscible solvents, chloroform, ethyl acetate and dichloromethane used and microcrystals prepared under slow and turbulent stirring conditions. The precipitated crystals were filtered using whatmann paper and dried at 60 ° C for 1 hour. The formulated crystals of Meloxicam were subjected to various physico-chemical parameters like size distribution, shape and drug, solvent interactions with DSC, IR, XRD etc., and found to be smaller in size than pure and crystalline in nature with free from any interactions.

The purpose of this work was to study the flocculation and settling properties of SBFs associated with drilling cuttings in both freshwater and seawater and provide more appropriate equations for existing transport models. [...] A digital imaging system was employed in this research to study the flocculation and settling processes. The effects of particle shape and size on the settling mechanism and the effects of salinity, fluid shear, discharge concentration and oily components on the rate of flocculation and the settling speeds of floes were studied. [...] The cutting sample for this study was collected from an exploration oil well in the east coast of Canada. The settling velocities of coarse particles from both untreated and thermally treated cuttings were measured in a 2. 5 m high and 14 cm inner diameter Plexiglas settling column using both freshwater and seawater. The flocculation of fine grain particles was performed using a laboratory <b>paddle</b> <b>stirrer</b> in both freshwater and seawater. The applied shears ranged from 25 to 200 s⁻¹, and the concentrations ranged from 25 to 200 mg/L. In order to study the effects of oily components on flocculation, a thermally treated sample was also used. From the experimental results it was shown that the untreated cuttings tend to clump together and settle fast while the treated cuttings settle as individual particles with relatively low speeds. The settling velocities of treated and untreated coarse particles were found to be functions of both particle sphericity and diameter following a power law. It was demonstrated by the flocculation tests that the steady state median floc size decreases as the shear stress and concentration increase, and the particles flocculate faster in seawater than in freshwater. For the same diameter and salinity, the flocs formed at high fluid shears have a higher settling velocity than do flocs formed at low shears. It was also shown that the flocs formed by untreated cuttings settle faster than flocs formed by thermally treated cuttings in the same conditions (shear rate and concentration) under which the flocs were produced...|$|E
