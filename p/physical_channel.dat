5|$|Telecommunications {{in which}} {{multiple}} transmitters and multiple receivers {{have been designed}} to cooperate and to share the same <b>physical</b> <b>channel</b> are called multiplex systems. The sharing of physical channels using multiplexing often gives very large reductions in costs. Multiplexed systems are laid out in telecommunication networks, and the multiplexed signals are switched at nodes through to the correct destination terminal receiver.|$|E
25|$|Papers by Gerard J. Foschini and Michael J. Gans, Foschini and Emre Telatar {{have shown}} that the channel {{capacity}} (a theoretical upper bound on system throughput) for a MIMO system is increased as the number of antennas is increased, proportional to the smaller of the number of transmit antennas and the number of receive antennas. This is known as the multiplexing gain and this basic finding in information theory is what led to a spurt of research in this area. Despite the simple propagation models used in the aforementioned seminal works, the multiplexing gain is a fundamental property that can be proved under almost any <b>physical</b> <b>channel</b> propagation model and with practical hardware that is prone to transceiver impairments.|$|E

40|$|Many {{markets that}} have {{traditionally}} relied on collocation of buyers, sellers, and products have introduced electronic channels. Although these electronic channels may provide benefits to {{buyers and sellers}} by lowering the transaction costs of participating in the market, there are trade-offs related to quality uncertainty and increased risk that may limit {{the adoption of the}} electronic channels. As a result, buyers and sellers use <b>physical</b> <b>channels</b> for some transactions and electronic channels for others. These usage patterns may evolve over time, particularly when the electronic channels are new. We examine buyer and seller use of electronic and <b>physical</b> <b>channels</b> in a market for products of uncertain quality (used vehicles) over a 2. 5 -year period. Results indicate that transactions involving low quality uncertainty and relatively rare products occurred in the electronic channels, whereas transactions involving high quality uncertainty and relatively plentiful products occurred in the <b>physical</b> <b>channels.</b> These patterns became clearer over time as buyers and sellers gained experience with the electronic channels. The electronic channels led to discounts for products of high quality uncertainty, but not for those of low quality uncertainty. physical markets, electronic markets, market channels, business-to-business auctions, quality uncertainty, adverse selection, market design, transaction costs, change over time, wholesale automotive...|$|R
