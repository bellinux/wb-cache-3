40|$|The {{exposure}} of Estonian cokery workers to <b>polynuclear</b> <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbons at an oil shale processing plant {{was assessed by}} occupational hygiene and biomonitoring measurements. To assess the external dose of exposure to <b>polynuclear</b> <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbons, pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene concentrations were measured from the breathing zone of workers during a workshift. Skin contamination with pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene was assessed by skin wipe sampling. As a biomarker of exposure to <b>polynuclear</b> <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbons and as an integral of all possible absorption routes of pyrene, 1 -hydroxypyrene concentration was measured from post-shift urine samples. Eighteen percent of the personal air samples exceeded the Finnish threshold limit value of benzol[a]pyrene (10 micrograms/m 3). Mean values for benzo[a]pyrene and pyrene were 5. 7 micrograms/m 3 and 8. 1 micrograms/m 3, respectively. Based on skin wipe sample analyses, the skin contamination was also obvious. The mean value of benzo[a]pyrene on the samples collected after the shift was 1. 2 ng/cm 2. In control samples, benzo[a]pyrene was not found. The mean value of urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene concentration was 6. 0 nmol/mmol creatinine for the exposed workers and 0. 5 nmol/mmol creatinine for the controls.

Using conventional enrichment method based on soil slurry, we isolated, screened and purified two bacterial species strains PB 1 and PB 2. Applying the ribotyping technique using the 16 S rRNA gene analysis, the strains were assigned to the genus Pseudomonas (Pseudomonas plecoglossicida strain PB 1 and Pseudomonas sp. PB 2). Both isolates showed promising metabolic capacity on pyrene sprayed MS agar plates during the preliminary investigations. Using time course studies in the liquid cultures at calculated concentrations 123, 64, 97 and 94 ppm for naphthalene, chrysene, fluroanthene and pyrene, P. plecoglossicida strain PB 1 and Pseudomonas sp. PB 2 showed partial utilization of the <b>polynuclear</b> <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbons.

40|$|Density {{functional}} {{theory has}} been used to model the selective catalytic oxidation of model <b>polynuclear</b> <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbons, in particular pyrene. Two transition metal catalysts have been employed, ruthenium tetroxide and a peroxy tungsten complex. The B 3 LYP method was used in all calculations. The LANL 2 DZ effective core potential was used for ruthenium and tungsten atoms. The 6 - 31 G(d,p) basis set was used for all other atoms. Selectivity studies show that catalyst-substrate adducts will form at the carbon-carbon bond of the <b>polynuclear</b> <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbon that will give the least reduction in aromaticity. The strain induced in planar <b>polynuclear</b> <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbon structures did not have a bearing on catalyst selectivity. Interior carbon-carbon bonds of <b>polynuclear</b> <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbons will not be attacked, meaning that oxidative fragmentation of these compounds starts at the exposed carbon-carbon bonds. For the ruthenium catalysed oxidation system, multiple catalyst attacks at similar sites on <b>polynuclear</b> <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbons is possible but unlikely due to the catalytic amounts used. It is indicated that the presence of aliphatic functional groups at the adduct formation sites for the ruthenium catalyst will not hinder adduct formation. Water is necessary for the success of both catalysts. The pathway found for ruthenium catalysed oxidation shows a stable dione intermediate, this intermediate has been confirmed by experimental findings and the literature. For the ruthenium catalyst water is required as it is involved in the reaction mechanism, facilitating the abstraction of hydrogen atoms adjacent to the catalyst adduct formation site. Water is not as directly involved in the tungsten catalyst mechanism, taking the role of a stabilising agent for transition state structures. The reaction pathways found for both catalysts show that the final reaction intermediate before breaking the carbon-carbon bond is an organic anhydride. Each reaction type shows a different route to this structure. Both reaction mechanisms show an energetically favourable trend from reactants to products.

This self-inhibition phenomenon cannot be eliminated by improving the light intensity but can be improved {{in the presence of}} a specified amount of phosphate, which extends the detection range of KHP.

40|$|The {{economic}} {{viability of the}} thermocatalytic upgrade of biomass-derived oxygenates is facing the challenge of low-quality products. This is because of leaching of active species, coking, and concomitant catalyst deactivation. These cumulate into the loss of catalytic activity with time on stream (TOS), which causes low degree of deoxygenation. Thus, this article reviews recent advances aimed at alleviating these setbacks to make the process viable for industrial scale-up. To {{understand the concept of}} catalyst deactivation and to offer solutions, the review scrutinized the deactivation mechanism diligently. The review also analyzes deactivation-suppression techniques such as nanocrystal zeolite cracking, hydrogen spilt-over (HSO) species, and composite catalysts (hybrid, hierarchical mesoporous zeolite, modified zeolites, and catalytic cracking deposition of silane). Interestingly, these deactivation-suppression techniques enhance catalytic properties mostly by reducing the signal strength of strong acid sites and increasing hydrothermal stability. Further, the approaches improve catalytic activity, selectivity, and TOS stability because of the lower formation of coke precursors such as <b>polynuclear</b> <b>aromatics.</b> However, despite these many advances, the need for further investigations to achieve excellent catalytic activity for industrial scale-up persists...|$|E

40|$|Some <b>polynuclear</b> <b>aromatics</b> (PNA) {{have been}} found to be potent {{carcinogens}} for all tissues and organs of experimental animals that have been exposed to them, but different dose levels are needed for these effects. They have been known for decades to cause cancer at the site of application but also at certain sites distant from the area of contact. Although some hydrocarbons are potent and complete carcinogens, the majority of related hydrocarbons was originally found to be inactive. Since they generally appear together, it was important to know more about their interaction, particularly whether they would synergize, or antagonize. The polycyclic hydrocarbons have been studied by subcutaneous injection, where they prove very potent carcinogens. They are also very active on the skin of mice where they produce cancer on prolonged application. Inhalation studies, require larger doses yielded negative results until particulate matter was introduced which facilitated the development of lung tumors. Although iron oxide dust was used initially, other dusts were also capable of enhancing the response of the tissue to benzo(a) pyrene carcinogenesis. This point is of importance, particularly since the inhalation of PNA in situations of air pollution or coal mining involves particulates, although of a different type. Soot is not a homogenous substance and several factors determine its properties. Soots will lose some of the absorbed chemicals during their residence in air, but they retain their PNAs for long periods of time when they reach the soil. The carcinogenicity of PNAs in the adsorbed state may be completely absent, depending on particle size of the soot and availability of eluting capability of the tissues or cells in contact with the soot. Whenever the carcinogenic <b>polynuclear</b> <b>aromatics</b> can be eluted they will be active in producing cancer if their residence is adequate. There seems to be no reason to assume that a large increase in coal combustion in the future will by necessity lead to greater risks of cancer to the coal miners or the general urban dweller, because activities to be started now can take into consideration the requirements necessary for control of air pollution in mines as well as in cities. If new uses of coal will be developed, it will be a completely different situation, and statements about the carcinogenic risk from coal utilization do not apply there. Although some of the same carcinogenic PNAs are involved in the health hazards from those processes, other carcinogens and also cocarcinogens will be present, and the exposed workers will not have the apparent benefits of adsorption of PNAs on soot...|$|E

In addition to the measurement of CO 2 evolution, periodic analyses of PNAs and hydrocarbons monitored biodegradation activity. The estimation of carbon balance and of soil organic matter assessed the fate of residual hydrocarbons.

A burst of CO 2 evolution followed each sludge addition, but substantial amounts of undegraded hydrocarbons remained {{at the end of}} the study. Hydrocarbon accumulation did not inhibit biodegradation performance. Conversion of hydrocarbons to CO 2 predominated during active disposal; incorporation into soil organic matter predominated during the closure period. In this sludge, the predominant PNAs were degraded more completely (85 %) than total hydrocarbons. Both biodegradation and abiotic losses of three- and four-ring PNAs contributed to this result.
