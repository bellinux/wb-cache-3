Wittgenstein believed that religious language is different from language used to describe physical objects because it occupies a different language game.|$|E

5|$|Before {{receiving}} the French intelligence material, Rejewski {{had made a}} careful study of Enigma messages, particularly of the first six letters of messages intercepted on a single day. For security, each message was encrypted using different starting positions of the rotors, as selected by the operator. This message setting was three letters long. To convey it to the receiving operator, the sending operator began the message by sending the message setting in a disguised form — a six-letter indicator. The indicator was formed using the Enigma with its rotors set to a common global setting for that day, termed the ground setting, which was shared by all operators. The <b>particular</b> <b>way</b> that the indicator was constructed introduced a weakness into the cipher.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{respective}} breeding seasons, {{several species of}} hummingbirds occur at the same locations in North America, and several hummingbird flowers bloom simultaneously in these habitats. These flowers have converged to a common morphology and color because these are effective at attracting the birds. Different lengths and curvatures of the corolla tubes can affect the efficiency of extraction in hummingbird species in relation to differences in bill morphology. Tubular flowers force a bird to orient its bill in a <b>particular</b> <b>way</b> when probing the flower, especially when the bill and corolla are both curved. This allows the plant to place pollen on a certain part of the bird's body, permitting a variety of morphological co-adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Rachel Larris, who {{has also}} {{conducted}} an academic study of The Daily Show, disputes the findings of Baumgartner and Morris. Larris argues that the study measured cynicism in overly broad terms, {{and that it would}} be extremely hard to find a causal link between viewing The Daily Show and thinking or acting in a <b>particular</b> <b>way.</b> Bloggers such as Marty Kaplan of The Huffington Post argue that so long as Stewart's comedy is grounded in truth, responsibility for increased cynicism belongs to the political and media figures themselves, not the comedian who satirizes them.|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{concerns}} {{in the use of}} <b>particular</b> <b>ways</b> of pricing of properties such as family houses in the Miroslav Area. In its first part, the basic terms regarding the legal, economical nomenclature are specified and pricing. The next part of work discusses the legal regulations and necessary documentsneeded for property pricing. The main aim of the work is to describe <b>particular</b> <b>ways</b> of pricing of properties. The ways of pricing which are used to evaluate family houses in this work are going to be compared among each other as well. This <b>particular</b> <b>ways</b> of evaluation will be divided into two groups - pricing according to the price regulations and pricing according to the market. The practical part is concerned in pricing of six family houses whose prices are defined in the cost and comparativemanner according to the regulation and non-regulation. The next chapter {{concerns in}} the share of price of land in the final price of property with the use of Naegeli's method. In the conclusion, an analysis of the <b>particular</b> <b>ways</b> used for counting prices of family houses is carried out and it is specified how the aspect of 'work opportunity' is involved in the pricing of family house...|$|R

5|$|In February 1761 Blackstone was {{considered}} as a potential Tory candidate for the rotten borough of Hindon in Wiltshire. After consultation with friends, he agreed to this prospect – {{at the same time}} refusing the offer of appointment as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. On 30 March 1761 he was returned for Hindon, and took his seat. This did not limit his legal work, initially, with the seat being given without a requirement to attend or vote in a <b>particular</b> <b>way,</b> and the grant of a patent of precedence at the same time actually increased the demand on his time. Court records show him pleading before Lord Mansfield in the Court of King's Bench soon after his election, and acting as counsel in Tonson v Collins, a copyright case, Thiquet v Bath, an important case on international law, and R v d'Eon, acting for the prosecution in a feud over Louis XV's newly appointed cross-dressing Ambassador to the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Molyneux was {{impressed}} with the creature's navigation code: he stated that it is the largest piece of code, and that players could change the map repeatedly and creatures will still find routes to their destinations. Molyneux also liked the fact that the game adapts to the player, enabling the choice of the preferred methods and strategies, and stated that his favourite part of the game is how the player digs out rather than build up, meaning the player has heavy involvement in building the level. He stated that he was proud of Dungeon Keepers concept, but remarked that doing original things takes time. He also liked that people were unable to describe Dungeon Keeper in any <b>particular</b> <b>way.</b> Molyneux disliked the user interface, saying the team overdid the control panel, and commented that it was a reminder that the player was playing a video game. This was a key reason the user interface of his next video game, Black & White, did not feature panels, buttons, or icons.|$|E
5|$|The {{first part}} of the title {{indicates}} that the ‘stories’ are not merely fictitious but have a factual basis in domestic, quotidian life, though readers would understand ‘from real life’ to mean ‘based on’ or ‘adapted from real ‘life’, and not necessarily ‘representation of actual events’. The ‘stories’ are ‘original’ because narratives for children should start afresh in order to avoid continued ideological contamination from vulgar chapbooks or courtly ‘fairy tales’. The phrase ‘real life’ strengthens ‘original’, excluding both the artificial and the fictional or imaginary. ‘Conversations’ suggests familiar, familial discourse rather than formal moralising. ‘Calculated’ suggests a programme rationally determined. These ‘conversations’ and ‘stories’ are also to construct the youthful self in a <b>particular</b> <b>way,</b> by regulating ‘the affections’ or emotional self and forming ‘the mind’ or rational and moral self ‘to truth and goodness’ – understood in terms of professional middle-class culture.|$|E

5|$|Raglan Castle {{was built}} in several phases, initial work {{occurring}} in the 1420s and 1430s, a major phase in the 1460s, with various alterations and additions {{at the end of}} the 16th century. The castle {{was built in}} stone, initially pale sandstone from Redbrook, and later Old Red Sandstone, with Bath Stone used for many of the detailed features. Like similar properties of the period, the castle of the 1460s was almost certainly designed to be approached and entered in a <b>particular</b> <b>way,</b> maximising the aesthetic and political value of the fortification. At Raglan, the design highlighted the Great Tower: a typical senior visitor would ride through Raglan village, and first the tower and then the rest of the castle would appear suddenly over the slight rise on the hill. A visitor would have needed to circle the Great Tower and the moat, before coming in through the gatehouse, into the Pitched Stone Court, around the edge of the communal hall, before reaching the previously hidden, and more refined, inner Fountain Court. Only then would a privileged guest be able to enter the Great Tower itself, overlooking the Herbert family's own chambers. Many less senior visitors or servants would never have entered this far, seeing only the external elements of the castle, but perhaps having been impressed by the outside of the Great Tower as they arrived.|$|E
