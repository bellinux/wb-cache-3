25|$|As {{a member}} of the <b>Preparatory</b> <b>Commission</b> for the Second Vatican Council, Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre had taken part in the discussions about the draft {{documents}} submitted to the bishops for consideration at the Council. His concerns with these proposals {{led to the formation of}} the study group to deal with a number of issues at the Council. A primary element of their agenda was opposition to the principle of episcopal collegiality, which they feared could undermine papal primacy and the rights of individual bishops. They thought there should be a specific condemnation of communism and that there should be a separate Council document elevating the status of the Blessed Virgin Mary, not merely a chapter in Lumen gentium.|$|E
25|$|The Commonwealth {{government}} was exiled in Washington, D.C. upon {{the invitation of}} Pres. Roosevelt. The Japanese took over Manila on January 2, 1942 and soon established the Japanese Military Administration to replace the exiled Commonwealth government. It utilized the existing administrative structure already in place and coerced high-ranking Commonwealth officials left behind to form a government. In order to win greater support for Japan and its war effort, no less than Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tōjō promised the Filipinos independence earlier than the Tydings–McDuffie Act had scheduled. But {{before it could be}} realized a constitution would have to be adopted. The <b>Preparatory</b> <b>Commission</b> for Philippine Independence drafted what {{came to be known as}} the 1943 Constitution. It provided for a unicameral National Assembly that was to be composed of provincial governors and city mayors as ex-officio members and an elected representative from each province and city who were to serve for a term of three years. Though created subordinate to the executive, the National Assembly had the power to elect the President, who in turn appoints the provincial governors and city mayors, ensuring him control of the legislature.|$|E

30|$|In Denmark, a society-centered and {{bottom-up}} {{perspective is}} the predominant, which sees (pre)existing cultural homogeneity as indispensable {{for the welfare}} state and maintains a ‘populist’ view of political sovereignty, where politicians should respond to, and respect the people, and where legislation {{to a lesser extent}} reflects <b>preparatory</b> <b>commissions</b> and expert advice (Jensen, 2014). In Sweden, a more state-centred and top-down approach prevails, whereby the modernizing welfare state promotes social inclusion and integrates society through equal treatment (Borevi, 2017). Politicians are more likely to see their role as one of leading the people and propose legislation in accordance with these guiding norms, and with social science emanating from expert commissions. Norway occupies an ambivalent, perhaps even confused, middle ground, which mixes strong concern with cultural and identitarian cohesion – but often filtered through expert commissions as ‘instrumental’ sociological arguments (rather than Denmark’s more populist political culture) – with equal treatment and human rights concerns, which are closer to Sweden.|$|R
