The experimental technique {{makes use of}} the birefringence to generate interference between the extraordinary and ordinary waves created after an incident <b>plane</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>wave</b> enters the crystal. The use of harmonic generation to convert I. R. radiations to UV-Visible, easy to detect, is novel.

40|$|Consider a {{waveguide}} structure {{consisting of}} a pair of metamaterial and dielectric slabs inserted in vacuum. A <b>plane</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>wave</b> is obliquely incident on it. Metamaterials (sometimes termed left-handed materials (LHMs)) are materials whose real parts of permittivity H and permeability P are both negative and consequently have negative index of refraction. The transmission of the electromagnetic waves through the structure is analyzed theoretically and numerically with the emphasis on the dissipation factor. Maxwell's equations are used to determine the electric and magnetic fields of the incident waves in each region. Then, Snell's law is applied and the boundary conditions of the fields are imposed at each layer interface to obtain a number of equations with unknown parameters. The MAPLE is used to solve these equations for the unknown parameters to calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients. These coefficients are used to determine the reflected, transmitted and loss powers of the structure. In the numerical results the mentioned powers are computed and illustrated as a function of frequency, angle of incidence and slab thickness when the dissipation factor changes...|$|E

From the wave equation, the derivation of the transmission and reflection coefficients for <b>plane</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> in elastic modiam by M. Musket and M, W. Meres was sketched.
