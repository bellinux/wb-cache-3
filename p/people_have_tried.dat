5|$|In several Western {{countries}} it {{has been}} seen that absences due to sickness for women are far greater than men. When investigating the reasons behind this, a study done in Sweden published in 1996 found {{that half of the}} difference between genders can be dismissed if you take out the days missed by pregnant women. When taking into account the health effects of double burden, child birth is always a possibility for mothers who already are faced with taking care of children and having a career and effects them and their health. In many studies <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to relate the difference in sickness absences directly to the double burden effect. It has been somewhat successful as women who are faced with work and child care have been known to request more sick days than men in the same situation. Additionally, working wives with children have twice the absence rate as men who are placed in the same position in work family conflicts.|$|E

Chinese weather prediction lore extends {{at least as far}} back as 300BC, which was also around the same time ancient Indian astronomers developed weather-prediction methods. In New Testament times, Christ himself referred to deciphering and understanding local weather patterns, by saying, [...] "When evening comes, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red', and in the morning, 'Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} things about cricket is the fact that a major section of the game, fielding, has little or no statistical data to call upon when selecting players, or making tactical adjustments. This had always puzzled Fountain, as he had extensive experience of baseball where all elements of the game, fielding included, are recorded. In 2010, Fountain's groundbreaking [...] "Fielding Analysis System" [...] for cricket was put into a software package, to allow every aspect of cricket fielding to be scored and analysed, giving a complete picture on a team or individuals performance. The system was first used by Fountain during his early stints with the West Indies on the 2000 / 2001 tour of Australia, and has been 10 years in development. Since that time various <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to imitate or copy it, including certain well known TV companies.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{not known}} exactly which {{complexity}} classes contain the decision version of the integer factorization problem. It {{is known to be}} in both NP and co-NP. This is because both YES and NO answers can be verified in polynomial time. An answer of YES can be certified by exhibiting a factorization [...] with [...] An answer of NO can be certified by exhibiting the factorization of N into distinct primes, all larger than M. We can verify their primality using the AKS primality test and that their product is N by multiplication. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic guarantees {{that there is only one}} possible string that will be accepted (providing the factors are required to be listed in order), which shows that the problem is in both UP and co-UP. It is known to be in BQP because of Shor's algorithm. It is suspected to be outside of all three of the complexity classes P, NP-complete, and co-NP-complete. It is therefore a candidate for the NP-intermediate complexity class. If it could be proved that it is in either NP-Complete or co-NP-Complete, that would imply NP = co-NP. That would be a very surprising result, and therefore integer factorization is widely suspected to be outside both of those classes. Many <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to find classical polynomial-time algorithms for it and failed, and therefore it is widely suspected to be outside P.|$|E
2500|$|For the , the Prince {{was given}} the name Dastan. According to Mechner, he chose the name as he had learned {{it was an old}} Persian name meaning [...] "trickster". Dastan was portrayed by American actor Jake Gyllenhaal. Gyllenhaal said that there were several reasons that he chose to accept the role of the Prince, {{including}} the character's appeal to him, the fact that the film was based on the video game, and he [...] " [...] to do things that <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> their hand at and haven't succeeded." [...] According to Gyllenhaal, he retrospectively felt he had over-prepared physically for his role as he knew little of what it entailed. He trained for five months prior to the beginning of filming in Morocco, and continued to train during the filming period. Despite the original script being written prior to the making of later games in the Sands of Time continuity, Mechner said that the production team for the film incorporated design elements from later games into the Prince's appearance. An element pointed out by staff is the Prince's appearance in the film's opening and climax, which was inspired by the Prince as he appeared in Warrior Within. The character's costumes were designed by Penny Rose. The Prince's most worn outfit, a loose-fitting spiral coat, was designed by her based on a picture from a piece of ancient Persian embroidery. Her costumes also made nods to the costume designs of the video games.|$|E
