40|$|We {{provide a}} {{critical}} {{review of the literature}} on early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> of economics crises and propose methods to overcome several pitfalls of the previous contributions. We use a quarterly panel of 40 EU and OECD countries for the period 1970 – 2010. As the response variable, we construct a continuous index of crisis incidence capturing the real costs for the economy. As the potential <b>warning</b> <b>indicators,</b> we evaluate a wide range of variables, selected according to the previous literature and our own considerations. For each potential indicator we determine the optimal lead employing panel vector autoregression, then we select useful indicators employing Bayesian model averaging. We re-estimate the resulting specification by system GMM to account for potential endogeneity of some indicators. Subsequently, to allow for country heterogeneity, we evaluate the random coefficients estimator and illustrate the stability among endogenous clusters. Our results suggest that global variables rank among the most useful early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators.</b> In addition, housing prices emerge consistently as an important domestic source of risk.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an {{experimental study of}} workers' responses to <b>proximity</b> <b>warnings</b> of static safety hazards on construction sites using a location-based <b>proximity</b> <b>warning</b> system named the Proactive Construction Management System (PCMS). A method of evaluating workers' responses to <b>proximity</b> <b>warnings</b> is proposed. The method consists of six variables: warning time and distance (the time and the minimum distance to a hazard when a worker receives a warning), dangerous time and distance (the time and the minimum distance to the hazard when the worker comes close to the hazard), and response time and distance (the difference between dangerous time and warning time, {{and the difference between}} dangerous distance and warning distance). Finally, whether a worker responds to a warning is evaluated against a two-second threshold and a two-meter threshold in terms of response time and distance respectively. The experiment was conducted over 17 workdays with the participation of 72 workers and resulted in 5391 warnings on a real-life construction project in Shanghai, China. The workers' responses were analyzed with respect to two factors: building trades and a-priori risk levels. The research found that workers responded to <b>proximity</b> <b>warnings</b> actively, but slightly differently across the selected building trades; carpenters had longer response latency in hazardous areas than ironworkers did, and response percentages were high for hazardous areas with high risks. The results also show evidence that PCMS has the potential to improve workers' safety performance. The limitations of the present study and future research directions are also addressed.

5000|$|The field {{windings}} are supplied with {{power from the}} battery via the ignition switch and regulator. A parallel circuit supplies the [...] "charge" [...] <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> and is earthed via the regulator (which is why the indicator is on when the ignition is on but the engine is not running). Once the engine is running and the alternator is generating power, a diode feeds the field current from the alternator main output equalizing the voltage across the <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> which goes off. The wire supplying the field current {{is often referred to}} as the [...] "exciter" [...] wire. The drawback of this arrangement is that if the warning lamp burns out or the [...] "exciter" [...] wire is disconnected, no current reaches the {{field windings}} and the alternator will not generate power. Some <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> circuits are equipped with a resistor in parallel with the lamp that permit excitation current to flow if the warning lamp burns out. The driver should check that the <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> is on when the engine is stopped; otherwise, there might not be any indication of a failure of the belt which may also drive the cooling water pump. Some alternators will self-excite when the engine reaches a certain speed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of developing early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> based on incident investigation. The use of early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> may contribute to ensure that oil companies produce oil and gas without harmful spills. The incident investigated was a hydraulic oil leak from the Eirik Raude drilling rig during exploration drilling in the Barents Sea in April 2005. The incident is analyzed using influence diagrams, from which seven general barriers against hydraulic leaks have been identified. For each barrier both checkpoints and indicators have been developed, which provide information {{about the status of}} the barriers and early warning of potential spills. The work described in this paper has shown {{that it is possible to}} develop early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> based on incident investigation. Several of the proposed checkpoints/indicators may have prevented the oil leak at Eirik Raude, if they had been in use prior to the incident...|$|R

40|$|The {{relatively}} {{high number of}} collisions between mining vehicles is the primary reason why collision detection and <b>proximity</b> <b>warning</b> systems are being increasingly introduced in this domain.

All combined, the studies reviewed, from a user-centred perspective, the effectiveness of a system being trialled.

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} COIC's {{experience}} with deposit-taking institutions during the 1980 s and 1990 s and presents {{a number of}} early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> of financial distress. Early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> do not eliminate bank failures. However, they should lead to early intervention and consequently help reduce losses to deposit insurance funds or governments. To be effective, early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> {{should be used in}} conjunction with professional judgement. Judgement must be exercised in choosing the relevant indicators and in interpreting the data derived from the early warning measures. The effectiveness of an early <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> also depends {{on the quality of the}} data. For example, many deposit-taking institutions that failed in Canada had inadequate information systems that generated unreliable data. The inaccurate data led management (and regulators) to believe the institution was healthy, resulted in poor decision making, delayed intervention by regulatory agencies, and eventually led to failure. Also, traditional cost valuation methods for preparing accounting information may not be appropriate for early warning data. For example, a "marked-to-market" valuation of assets and liabilities of financial institutions can lead to sounder decision making and is more appropriate for assets such as marketable securities and derivativei products. Furthermore, for an early <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> to be effective, indicators need to be supplemented by information that is not of a financial nature. On-site examinations provide crucial first-hand information onmanagement's strategy and competence, the adequacy of internal controls and the accuracy of financial reporting. Moreover, macro- and micro-economic data, market trend indicators (i. e., real estate values, stock market indices) and industry-specific data can explain how external forces have affected the institution in the past and how they can affect it in the future. Finally, early warning systems must cover all the key functions of a bank's operations and potential areas of risk, namely (among many others) internal audit, cash management and liquidity, securities operations, loan portfolio, other assets, deposit liabilities, capital adequacy, profit and loss and market risks, This paper provides early <b>warning</b> signs and <b>indicators</b> for the above dimensions. ...|$|R
