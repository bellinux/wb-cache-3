5|$|Inspired by her new teacher, Blu Rain (Paula Patton), Precious finally {{learns to}} read and write. She meets {{sporadically}} with social worker Ms. Weiss (Mariah Carey), who learns about incest in the household when Precious reveals who fathered her children. While Precious is in the hospital giving birth to her second child, Abdul, she meets John McFadden (Lenny Kravitz), a nursing assistant who shows her kindness. Upon returning home, her mother carelessly drops 3-day-old Abdul and hits her, angrily declaring that Precious' revelation about the incest has resulted in their being cut off from welfare. Precious fights back and runs away from her home with Abdul. As they set out, she stops at a church window and watches the choir singing a Christmas hymn inside, imagining {{that she and her}} fantasy boyfriend are together and singing the song. Precious breaks into her school classroom seeking shelter. After Blu discovers her the next morning, she frantically calls local shelters looking for a safe place for <b>Precious</b> <b>to</b> stay. Later that night, Precious stays with Blu and her live-in girlfriend. The next morning, Blu takes her and Abdul to find assistance for them. She tells Precious that she will be able to continue her schooling while she raises Abdul in a halfway house.|$|E
5|$|Picard confronts Q, {{who tells}} him that {{although}} the bout with the Nausicaan nearly cost him his life, it also gave him a sense of his mortality. It taught him that life was too <b>precious</b> <b>to</b> squander by playing it safe. Picard realizes that his attempts to suppress and ignore {{the consequences of his}} indiscretions have resulted in him losing a part of himself. Picard then declares that he would rather die as captain of the Enterprise than live as a nobody. Q sends him back to the bar fight and events unfold as they did originally, with Picard being stabbed through the heart and laughing as he collapses to the floor. In the present, Picard awakens in sickbay, a Captain again. As Picard recovers from his injury, he wonders if his journey into the past was one of Q's tricks or merely a dream. Nevertheless, he is grateful for the insight the experience gave him.|$|E
25|$|Such {{moments in}} life are just as memorable as when one is {{appointed}} to prominent positions. When my comrades took farewell to me, I was equally moved as I had ever been when I was given an important office. What I thought most about was that I had finished my duties towards the people, the Party and the state. This memory is very <b>precious</b> <b>to</b> me.|$|E

25|$|Legazpi and Urdaneta's {{expedition}} to the Philippines effectively created the trans-Pacific Manila galleon trade, in which silver mined from Mexico and Potosí was exchanged for Chinese silk, porcelain, Indonesian spices, Indian gems and other goods <b>precious</b> <b>to</b> Europe at the time. The trade route formed an important commercial link between Latin America and the Asia-Pacific with the trade products even carried over to Europe via the Havana Galleons, while heavily financing the Spanish Empire.|$|E
25|$|Only one Red Cross {{supply of}} parcels was {{received}} by the prisoners between March 1942 and September 1945. This arrived in March 1944 and worked out at one sixth of a parcel per person: a single tin of food. Prisoners occasionally were able to buy or barter chicks which they raised on worms and beetles and rice sweepings from the quartermaster's store floor (other edible food scraps being too <b>precious</b> <b>to</b> use). If female these provided much-needed eggs.|$|E
25|$|Second, {{their land}} {{became even more}} <b>precious</b> <b>to</b> them. Most Nauruans {{continue}} to live on Nauru. Those who do migrate do so either to seek education, to take positions in Nauruan diplomatic missions, or, in a few cases, to take jobs in Australia. But {{the bulk of the}} Nauruan population can be found living on the island of Nauru. In this they differ markedly from other Pacific Island nations where a growing proportion of the population {{is to be found in}} metropolitan countries.|$|E

25|$|Oriental carpets {{began to}} appear in Europe after the Crusades in the 11th century, due to contact by Crusaders with Eastern traders. Until the mid-18th century they were mostly used on walls and tables. Except in royal or ecclesiastical {{settings}} they were considered too <b>precious</b> <b>to</b> cover the floor. Starting in the 13th century oriental carpets begin to appear in paintings (notably from Italy, Flanders, England, France, and the Netherlands). Carpets of Indo-Persian design were introduced to Europe via the Dutch, British, and French East India Companies of the 17th and 18th century.|$|E
25|$|Although Laplace {{was removed}} from office, it was {{desirable}} to retain his allegiance. He was accordingly raised to the senate, and to the third volume of the Mécanique céleste he prefixed a note {{that of all the}} truths therein contained the most <b>precious</b> <b>to</b> the author was the declaration he thus made of his devotion towards the peacemaker of Europe. In copies sold after the Bourbon Restoration this was struck out. (Pearson points out that the censor would not have allowed it anyway.) In 1814 it was evident that the empire was falling; Laplace hastened to tender his services to the Bourbons, and in 1817 during the Restoration he was rewarded with the title of marquis.|$|E
25|$|Juliette Benzoni {{received}} in 1973 the Alexandre Dumas Prix for her complete work at that time, the Catherine and the Marianne series. The prize was <b>precious</b> <b>to</b> her, {{she had been}} a fervent admiress of Alexander Dumas since her childhood. She mentioned in the Magazine Littéraire that the medal was always on her working table. In 1988 Académie française, (founded in 1635 by Cardinal Richelieu) had chosen her for the Literature prize Prix Louis Barthou, {{in the form of a}} silver medal for Félicia au soleil couchant. In 1998 at the age of 78 she received the Knight of National Order of Merit – Chevalier de l'Ordre National, awarded by the President of the French Republic.|$|E

500|$|Dante {{is one of}} {{the twin}} sons of Sparda, the demon knight who sided with {{humanity}} and drove back an invasion of the human world by demons roughly 2,000 years prior to the events of the series. After Sparda's death, Dante and his identical twin brother Vergil were raised by their human mother, Eva. When Dante and Vergil were children, the family was attacked by demons, resulting in Eva's death. This event led to Dante's commitment to hunting demons in pursuit of those that killed his mother. Dante is confident in his encounters with opponents, and frequently taunts enemies before battling them. With the exception of Devil May Cry 4, Dante says the phrase [...] "Devils never cry" [...] in every game, implying that no matter how much of a demon he may prove to be, his ability to cry makes his human side <b>precious</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E
500|$|Ruth {{continued}} with her studies at Harper Adams {{and she and}} David eventually established [...] "a good working relationship". Ruth was given the responsibility of looking after the dairy herd, before becoming {{a partner in the}} farm. Ruth and David's first child, Philippa Rose, or Pip (Helen Monks), was born in February 1993. Joanna Toye and Adrian Flynn, authors of The Archers Encyclopaedia, said Ruth took to motherhood well and did not let it stop her from playing an active part in Brookfield. The couple's second child, Joshua, was born in 1997. Ruth and David later purchased some Hereford cattle and began to establish themselves as suppliers of traditional beef. Toye and Flynn observed that Ruth and David's marriage had to be strong when the Archer siblings began arguing over who would inherit Brookfield Farm. Ruth told David that [...] "time was too <b>precious</b> <b>to</b> spend in argument" [...] and suggested they moved away. However, David's father, Phil, decided that the farm should go to the couple.|$|E

Sasuke's older brother, Itachi Uchiha, killed the rest of their family. Because of this, Sasuke's sole desire is to kill his brother, and he develops a cold and withdrawn personality, seeing people as tools to further his goals, although also gaining the affection of most of the girls he knew, much to his annoyance. When made a member of Team 7, Sasuke seems to begin to consider them <b>precious</b> <b>to</b> the point of risking his life to protect them, while focusing less on revenge at the start of the series. Following an encounter and subsequent defeat at the hands of his brother in Part I, however, Sasuke severs his ties and leaves the village to seek more power from a man named Orochimaru. Sasuke is voiced by Noriaki Sugiyama, and his English voice actor is Yuri Lowenthal ...|$|E

500|$|James Jean {{was invited}} by Shinoda and Delson {{to listen to}} the band's rough {{material}} created early on during the recording sessions for The Hunting Party. He acknowledged the band's change of musical direction from A Thousand Suns and Living Things, and was inspired by the material to create artworks that were [...] "charged with [...] intensity as well as their rationale for that change". However, Joe Hahn banned Jean from listening to any more material after Jean had performed some of the songs from memory on his piano. Jean originally sketched each individual artwork for The Hunting Party in a personal sketchbook, where it felt more intimate and less <b>precious</b> <b>to</b> Jean. The minimality of the images was intentional, as the artworks would eventually be made into 3D-modelled artworks where lighting and texture would be added to each character. 20 artworks were made {{in the space of a}} month by Jean for Brandon Parvini and his team to transform into 3D-modelled artworks, with Parvini choosing exactly which artworks would be modelled for The Hunting Party.|$|E

In The Slash, Firo's purposely knocks over their dominoes, enraging Isaac and Miria. The pair decide to spend the night at the Genoard mansion with Jacuzzi. When Tim and the Larvae arrive at the mansion, they believe that the display of Dallas' immortality is a magic trick and the fights are dances.

[...] After everyone departs the mansion, the duo decide to [...] "steal" [...] Ronnie Sukiart and Ennis, two people <b>precious</b> <b>to</b> Firo, in an attempt to make him apologize. However, Firo wrongly assumes that Dallas kidnapped Ronnie and Ennis. Isaac and Miria are confronted by plainclothes officers in 1934 in Imprisoned Chapter Alice in Jails. Isaac knows they are in fact police-in-disguise and realizes that Miria is unaware of this and sends her away. He is arrested for multiple thefts and imprisoned on Alcatraz Island. Isaac is released later in the year and reunites with Miria in Chicago, as told in Conclusion Chapter Peter Pan In Chains. In Children of Bottle, set in 2001, they finally understand they are immortal after realizing they have not aged at all.|$|E
500|$|By 1808 it {{was still}} {{considered}} unsafe to return to Berlin, and the royal family consequently spent the summer near Königsberg; Louise believed that the hard trials of her children's early lives {{would be good for}} them: [...] "If they had been reared in luxury and prosperity they might think that so it must always be." [...] In the winter of 1808, Tsar Alexander I invited the king and queen to St. Petersburg, where she was treated to sumptuously decorated rooms; [...] "Nothing dazzles me anymore", she exclaimed on her return to Germany. Near the birth of her youngest child Princess Louise in 1809, Louise wrote to her father, [...] "Gladly...the calamities which have befallen us have not forced their way into our wedded and home life, rather have strengthened the same, and made it even more <b>precious</b> <b>to</b> us." [...] Louise was sick for much of that year, but returned with the king to Berlin near the end of it after an absence of three years; the queen arrived in a carriage accompanied by her two daughters Charlotte and Alexandrine and younger son Charles, and was greeted by her father at Charlottenburg Palace– the residence was ransacked however, as Napoleon and his commanders had stripped its rooms of paintings, statues, manuscripts, and antiquities. Returning to a much different Prussia than she left, a preacher observed that [...] "our dear queen is far from joyful, but her seriousness has a quiet serenity... her eyes have lost their former sparkle, and one sees that they have wept much, and still weep".|$|E
