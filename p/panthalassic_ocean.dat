500|$|When the rifting of Pangea, due to {{the process}} of plate tectonics, pushed North America away from Europe and Africa and into the <b>Panthalassic</b> <b>Ocean</b> (ancestor to the modern Pacific Ocean), the Pacific Northwest {{was not part of the}} {{continent}}. As the North American continent moved westward, the Farallon Plate subducted under its western margin. As the plate subducted, it carried along island arcs which were accreted to the North American continent, resulting in the creation of the Pacific Northwest between 150 and 90million years ago. The general outline of the Columbia Basin was not complete until between 60 and 40million years ago, but it lay under a large inland sea later subject to uplift. Between 50 and 20million years ago, from the Eocene through the Miocene eras, tremendous volcanic eruptions frequently modified much of the landscape traversed by the Columbia. The lower reaches of the ancestral river passed through a valley near where Mount Hood later arose. Carrying sediments from erosion and erupting volcanoes, it built a [...] thick delta that underlies the foothills on the east side of the Coast Range near Vernonia in northwestern Oregon. Between 17million and 6million years ago, huge outpourings of flood basalt lava covered the Columbia River Plateau and forced the lower Columbia into its present course. The modern Cascade Range began to uplift 5 to 4million years ago. Cutting through the uplifting mountains, the Columbia River significantly deepened the Columbia River Gorge.|$|E

Their abundance in sediments from the P-T boundary indicates hydrogen sulfide was present even in shallow waters.|$|R
40|$|From 1989 to 1994 {{a series}} of papers {{outlined}} evidence for a brief episode of climate change from arid to humid, {{and then back to}} arid, during the Carnian Stage of the late Triassic Epoch. This time of climate change was compared to marine and terrestrial biotic changes, mainly extinction and then radiation of flora and fauna. Subsequently termed, albeit incorrectly, the Carnian Pluvial Event (CPE) by successive authors, interest in this episode of climatic change has increased steadily, with new evidence being published as well as several challenges to the theory. The exact nature of this humid episode, whether reflecting widespread precipitation or more local effects, as well as its ultimate cause, remains equivocal. Bed-by-bed sampling of the Carnian in the Southern Alps (Dolomites) shows the episode began with a negative carbon isotope excursion that lasted for only part of one ammonoid zone (A. austriacum). However, that the Carnian Humid Episode represents a significantly longer period, both environmentally and biotically, is irrefutable. The evidence is strongest in the European, Middle Eastern, Himalayan, North American and Japanese successions, but not always so clear in South America, Antarctica and Australia. The eruption of the Wrangellia Large Igneous Province and global warming (causing increased evaporation in the Tethyan and <b>Panthalassic</b> <b>oceans)</b> are suggested as causes for the humid episode...|$|R
50|$|Climate modelers are {{additionally}} {{attempting to}} further understand and {{account for the}} surface and deep water circulations of the <b>Panthalassic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> The transport of heat resulting from these circulations significantly alters the simulated monsoon; therefore accurately representing them is of great importance. Continued research will eventually provide scientists with a much more complete comprehension of the progression and behavior of the megamonsoon that dominated the climate of Pangea.|$|E
50|$|As with North America and Europe, Gondwana {{was largely}} covered with shallow seas during the Ordovician. Shallow clear waters over {{continental}} shelves encouraged {{the growth of}} organisms that deposit calcium carbonates in their shells and hard parts. The <b>Panthalassic</b> <b>Ocean</b> covered much of the northern hemisphere, and other minor oceans included Proto-Tethys, Paleo-Tethys, Khanty Ocean, which was closed off by the Late Ordovician, Iapetus Ocean, and the new Rheic Ocean.|$|E
50|$|The Pacific Ocean {{developed}} from the Panthalassa, a vast global ocean, following {{the breakup of the}} supercontinent Pangaea in the Mesozoic Era, gradually forming Gondwana and Laurasia, which in turn divided. There is no firm date for when the changeover occurred, as the replacement of the sea bed is a continuous process, though reconstruction maps often change the name from Panthalassic to Pacific around the time the Atlantic Ocean began to open. The <b>Panthalassic</b> <b>Ocean</b> first opened around 750 million years ago at the breakup of Rodinia, but the oldest Pacific Ocean floor is only around 180 Ma old. Any older Pacific floor crust has been subducted.|$|E
5000|$|Panthalassa, {{also known}} as the <b>Panthalassic</b> or Panthalassan <b>Ocean,</b> (from Greek [...] "all" [...] and [...] "sea"), was the superocean that {{surrounded}} the supercontinent Pangaea. During the Paleozoic—Mesozoic transition [...] 250 [...] it occupied almost 70% of Earth's surface. Its ocean-floor has completely disappeared because of the continuous subduction along the continental margins on its circumference. Panthalassa is also referred to as the Paleo-Pacific ("old Pacific") or Proto-Pacific because the Pacific Ocean developed from its centre in the Mesozoic to the present.|$|R
40|$|Models {{of ocean}} {{circulation}} and biogeochemical cycles {{are used to}} speculate about possible mechanisms of deep-sea anoxia across the Permo-Triassic boundary. Two modes of likely Late Permian ocean thermohaline circulation are identified: a vigorous “thermal mode” driven by cooling in southern polar latitudes and a weaker “haline mode” driven by evaporation from the subtropics. We find that the thermal mode, typical of climates such as our own, is unlikely to surpport deep-sea anoxia. The haline mode, which might exist in warm climates with enhanced hydrological cycles, can lead to significant but periodic depletion of oxygen in the <b>Panthalassic</b> deep <b>ocean.</b> However, owing to the inherent instability of the haline mode, a deep-sea anoxia persisting {{for millions of years}} is not clearly supported by this study, though mechanisms emerge which might be consistent with the observed record. The enhanced hydrological cycle (or reduced oceanic diapycnal mixing) required to obtain the haline mode remain unconstrained for the Late Permian...|$|R
5000|$|Rocks of Wrangellia (the {{individual}} terrane, not the CT) {{were originally}} {{created in the}} Pennsylvanian to the Jurassic somewhere, but probably near the equator, in the <b>Panthalassic</b> <b>Ocean</b> off of {{the west coast of}} the North American craton as island arcs, oceanic plateaus, and rock assemblages of the associated tectonic settings. Although composed of many different rocks types, of various composition, age, and tectonic affinity, it is the late Triassic flood basalts that are the defining unit of Wrangellia. These basalts, extruded onto land over 5-million years about 230 million years ago, on top of an extinct Pennsylvanian and Permian island arc, constitute a large igneous province, currently exposed in a 2500 km long belt.|$|E
50|$|During the Hirnantian, {{much of the}} world’s {{land mass}} was {{gathered}} into a supercontinent called Gondwana, which occupied extreme southern latitudes and covered the south pole. This included South America, Africa, most of Australia, the bulk of India, and Antarctica. What is now west Africa was then located at the pole, while South America was close by, joined to Africa along the latter's west coast. Along Africa's east coast were Antarctica and India, while Australia lay just {{to the north of}} them, straddling the equator. To the north of Australia was New Guinea. It may have been the northernmost point of land in the world, located just above 30 degrees north latitude. To the north of it lay a vast, uninterrupted sea, known today as the <b>Panthalassic</b> <b>ocean.</b>|$|E
50|$|The ocean {{formed when}} Pannotia disintegrated, Proto-Laurasia (Laurentia, Baltica, and Siberia) rifted {{away from a}} supercontinent that would become Gondwana. Proto-Tethys formed between these two supercontinents. The ocean was bordered by <b>Panthalassic</b> <b>Ocean</b> to the north, {{separating}} it from Panthalassa by island arcs and Kazakhstania. The Proto-Tethys expanded during the Cambrian. The ocean was at its widest during the Late Ordovician to Middle Silurian. The ocean was situated between the Siberia to the west, and Gondwana to the east. The ocean began to shrink during the Late Silurian, when North China, and South China moved away from Gondwana and headed north. In the late Devonian, the microcontinent of Kazakhstania collided with Siberia, shrinking the ocean even more. The ocean closed when the North China craton collided with Siberia-Kazakstania continent in the Carboniferous, while the Paleo-Tethys Ocean expanded.|$|E
50|$|In the Cambrian period, the {{continent}} of Laurentia, which would later become North America, sat on the equator, with three bordering oceans: the <b>Panthalassic</b> <b>Ocean</b> {{to the north and}} west, the Iapetus Ocean to the south and the Khanty Ocean to the east. In the Earliest Ordovician, around 480 Ma, the microcontinent of Avalonia - a landmass incorporating fragments of what would become eastern Newfoundland, the southern British Isles, and parts of Belgium, northern France, Nova Scotia, New England, South Iberia and northwest Africa - broke free from Gondwana and began its journey to Laurentia. Baltica, Laurentia, and Avalonia all came together {{by the end of the}} Ordovician to form a minor supercontinent called Euramerica or Laurussia, closing the Iapetus Ocean. The collision also resulted in the formation of the northern Appalachians. Siberia sat near Euramerica, with the Khanty Ocean between the two continents. While all this was happening, Gondwana drifted slowly towards the South Pole. This was the first step of the formation of Pangaea.|$|E
50|$|The comics are set {{around six}} pygmies, named Ooga, Klik, Klak, Booga, Dooby and Nooby, all form their tribe, Oogka Chaka, and are always loyal to their gods, with the {{exception}} to Ooga, who thinks worshipping the gods {{is a waste of}} time, and does not believe in them. Regardless of Ooga's thoughts, the tribe, Klik mainly, still believe and honour them. The story is set on a small archipelago of islands, approximately 200 Mya (million years ago, set in the Triassic period), when the super continent Pangaea was still formed. According to the game, the islands are located in the <b>Panthalassic</b> <b>Ocean,</b> opposite Pangaea. It is set mainly on Oog Island, the home of the tribe. It is a relatively small island, with a small type of forest. When the Gem of Life faded its colour, the Pygmies travel to an unnamed island, with a large rainforest and a hidden temple. Inside the temple is an Egyptian-like setting, with hieroglyphic writing on its walls. The temple is almost like an Indiana Jones setting, especially when Nooby discovers a hat, (resembling a Fedora). According to Ooga, the islands are located in the tropics.|$|E

40|$|Severe {{changes in}} ocean redox, {{nutrient}} cycling, and marine productivity accompanied most Phanerozoic mass extinctions. However, evidence for marine photic zone euxinia (PZE) as a globally important extinction {{mechanism for the}} end-Triassic extinction (ETE) is currently lacking. Fossil molecular (biomarker) and nitrogen isotopic records from a sedimentary sequence in western Canada provide the first conclusive evidence of PZE and disrupted biogeochemistry in neritic waters of the <b>Panthalassic</b> <b>Ocean</b> during the end Triassic. Increasing water-column stratification and deoxygenation across the ETE led to PZE in the Early Jurassic, paralleled by a perturbed nitrogen cycle and ecological turnovers among noncalcifying groups, including eukaryotic algae and prokaryotic plankton.

40|$|A diverse Late Permian {{assemblage}} of chondrichthyan and actinopterygian micro- and macroremains is presented {{from the central}} Iranian locality of Baghuk Mountain for the first time. The vertebrate remains were found in sediments containing mainly pelagic organisms such as nautiloids, ammonoids, and conodonts. Their habitat is interpreted as a deep shelf area with well-oxygenated bottom water conditions below the storm wave base. The chondrichthyans are represented by various dermal denticles, a fragment of a spine, and a low number of teeth from mostly durophagous hybodontiforms and eugeneodontiforms. A new eugeneodontid species is described as Bobbodus xerxesi sp. nov.; this genus was known only from {{the east coast of}} the former <b>Panthalassic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> The actinopterygian remains are represented by dermal bones, teeth, and scales. The bones are only fragmentarily preserved.

40|$|Norian–Rhaetian reef-limestone {{outcrops}} {{belonging to}} the Sambosan Accretionary Complex located near and within Inaba Cave, western Shikoku Island (Japan), are described in detail {{for the first time}}. This patch-reef complex is inferred to have formed within an atoll-type carbonate system accumulated over a mid-oceanic seamount surrounded by deep-water radiolarian cherts in the <b>Panthalassic</b> <b>Ocean</b> during the Late Triassic. Because most Upper Triassic reef studies are from the former Tethys Ocean, counterparts from the <b>Panthalassic</b> <b>Ocean,</b> such as this study, are fundamental in resolving sedimentological, palaeontological and palaeobiogeographical issues related to Late Triassic reefs. The microfacies, palaeontology and palaeoecology of the Inaba reef limestones were investigated. The reef-boundstone facies is characterised by abundant coralline sponges that, in association with microbial crusts, constitute the main framebuilders. Some phaceloid and/or dendroid corals occur, but these groups are poorly represented, as are algae. Microproblematica and foraminifers exhibit rich associations, acting as secondary reef builders and/or reef dwellers. The surrounding setting comprises biodetrital sponge–coral rudstone and well-preserved megalodont rudstone-floatstone. The sedimentary contact between reef and lagoon facies is observed for the first time within Inaba Cave. Important similarities with the coeval Upper Triassic reefs of the southern classic Peri-Tethys area and especially with the Omani seamounts are recognised, suggesting a more southern-Hemisphere origin for Upper Triassic Japanese reefs than predicted by previous reef studies...|$|E
40|$|The Pacific Ocean {{evolved from}} the <b>Panthalassic</b> <b>Ocean</b> that was first formed ca 750  Ma with the rifting apart of Rodinia. By 160  Ma, the first ocean floor {{ascribed}} to the current Pacific plate was produced {{to the west of}} a spreading centre in the central Pacific, ultimately growing to become the largest oceanic plate on the Earth. The current Nazca, Cocos and Juan de Fuca (Gorda) plates were initially one plate, produced to the east of the original spreading centre before becoming split into three. The islands of the Pacific have originated as: linear chains of volcanic islands on the above plates either by mantle plume or propagating fracture origin, atolls, uplifted coralline reefs, fragments of continental crust, obducted portions of adjoining lithospheric plates and islands resulting from subduction along convergent plate margins. Out of the 11 linear volcanic chains identified, each is briefly described and its history summarized.

40|$|A well-preserved ammonoid fauna of Early Dienerian age {{has long}} been known from the lower portion of the Candelaria Formation in the old Candelaria silver mining {{district}} in Mineral and Esmeralda Counties, Nevada, but for a number of reasons, this fauna has never been studied in detail nor illustrated. Previous authors assigned this ammonoid fauna to the Early Dienerian Proptychites candidus Zone of Canada. In reality, it more closely resembles the Tethyan faunas than the higher palaeolatitude Canadian faunas, thus indicating the presence of some degree of equatorial faunal exchange between opposite sides of the <b>Panthalassic</b> <b>Ocean</b> during Early Dienerian time. It also indicates the onset of a provincialism, which contrasts with the cosmopolitan Griesbachian faunas. A rigorous taxonomic analysis of the Candelaria fauna allows us to differentiate the following ten species, which include two new species and one new genus (Mullericeras nov. gen.) belonging to the new family Mullericeratidae: Ambites lilangensis (Krafft, 1909), Ambites aff. radiatus (Brühwiler, Brayard, Bucher and Guodun, 2008), Ussuridiscus sp. indet., “Koninckites” aff. kraffti Spath, 1934, Mullericeras spitiense (Krafft, 1909), Mullericeras fergusoni nov. sp., Mullericeras sp. indet., Proptychites haydeni (Krafft, 1909), Proptychites pagei nov. sp., Vavilovites sp. indet. and Parahedenstroemia kiparisovae Shigeta and Zakharov, 2009. This Early Dienerian fauna correlates with the Ambites fauna known {{from the base of the}} Ceratite Marls in the Salt Range and from the base of the “Meekoceras” beds in Spiti (northern Gondwanian margin). The fauna also permits the precise dating of a shelfal anoxic episode on the equatorial North American margin. This anoxic event correlates in time with similar palaeoceanographic changes in the southern Tethys, which indicates that the Early Triassic biotic recovery was at least partly shaped by such discrete, short events rather than by pervasive and lingering adverse environmental conditions...|$|E
40|$|Models of mass extinctions {{caused by}} {{greenhouse}} warming {{depend on the}} ability of warming to affect the oxygenation of the ocean, either through slowing circulation or changes in biological productivity and the organic carbon budget. Opal Creek, Alberta, Canada is a biostratigraphically continuous Permian–Triassic Boundary (PTB) section deposited in deep water on an outer shelf setting in the vast and understudied <b>Panthalassic</b> <b>Ocean,</b> along the western margin of Pangaea. The latest-Permian extinction is here represented as the disappearance of the previously dominant benthic fauna (siliceous sponges). On the basis of nitrogen and reduced sulfur isotopes as well as productivity-sensitive trace elements, the Middle Permian at Opal Creek is interpreted as a highly productive coastal upwelling zone where vigorous denitrification and sulfate reduction occurred in a mid-water oxygen minimum. Similar conditions appear to have continued into the latest Permian until the onset of a euxinic episode represented by a discrete pyrite bed and several trace element indicators of high productivity. This euxinic pulse is followed by the extinction of benthic fauna and a shift in nitrogen and sulfur isotopes to more normal marine values, suggesting the cessation of coastal upwelling and the consequent weakening of the mid-water oxygen minimum. The Lower Triassic appears to be a dysoxic, relatively unproductive environment with a bottom water oxygen minimum. Rhenium–osmium isotope systematics show a minimum of radiogenic Os near the main extinction event, which may be due to volcanic input, and increasingly radiogenic values approaching the PTB, possibly due to increased continental erosion. The Opal Creek system demonstrates that, while the biogeochemical crisis in the latest Permian was capable of impacting the coastal upwelling modality of ocean circulation, a transient increase in productivity likely drove the system toward euxinia and, ultimately, extinction...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 This study aims {{to better}} {{understand}} the series of events leading up to and following the Permian-Triassic mass extinction as it took place in the <b>Panthalassic</b> <b>Ocean</b> basin, with a particular focus on the oceanographic factors controlling nutrient cycles, redox conditions, and the ecology of the planktonic community. The first two chapters focus on the Opal Creek section, in Alberta, Canada, which records deposition in a slope setting at subtropical latitudes on the northwestern margin of Pangaea. The first chapter of this study uses organic carbon and nitrogen isotopes, as well as the abundant but homogenous conodont community, to infer the presence of a nutrient rich coastal upwelling system along the continental margin, with highly enriched nitrogen isotopes interpreted as reflecting denitrification in a well-developed water column oxygen minimum zone. Subsequent analysis using trace element proxies for redox and productivity, as well as declining nitrogen isotope values, suggest a substantial weakening of coastal upwelling in the earliest Triassic coinciding with the extinction of the benthic sponge fauna and an increase in the sedimentation rate. Marine primary productivity is among the most important variables influencing water column redox conditions and benthic community structure, however it is extremely difficult to estimate from ancient marine rocks. The final chapter of this study aims to develop quantitative tools for estimating paleoproductivity, based on parameters that can be measured or calculated for most marine sedimentary systems. This study uses a compilation of 93 Cenozoic (primarily Quaternary) marine cores for which the sedimentary bulk accumulation rate could be calculated. Accumulation rates of organic carbon, phosphorus and biogenic barium are compared to estimates of primary and export productivity in the modern ocean derived from carbon- 14 uptake and satellite measurements of chlorophyll. The resulting equations relating proxy accumulation to productivity can be applied {{to a wide variety of}} ancient marine systems, allowing for more quantitative reconstructions of paleoproductvity and comparison to other geochemical proxies for nutrient availability or environmental stress...|$|E
40|$|The {{extinction}} at the Permian-Triassic boundary marked one of {{the most}} profound events of the Phanerozoic Eon. Although numerous hypotheses have been proposed, the trigger mechanism continues to be debated. This thesis intends to examine the impact of oceanic conditions on the extinction event by analyzing hydrocarbon biomarkers. Hydrocarbon biomarkers are chemical fossils in sedimentary rocks that serve as proxies to measure the conditions that prevailed during deposition. In this thesis, biomarkers for redox conditions, depositional environment, microbial community and potential age-related biomarkers have been measured and are reported from four sections that span the Permian-Triassic boundary. The first section, from the Peace River Basin in modern-day western Canada, was deposited on the eastern margin of the <b>Panthalassic</b> <b>Ocean</b> and samples conditions in this global water body. The second section is from Kap Stosch, Greenland, and was deposited on the southern margin of an epicontinental sea situated in the northwest of the supercontinent Pangaea. The Great Bank of Guizhou, China is the third section studied, and it is a carbonate platform deposited on the southern edge of {{one of the}} smaller continental blocks that formed the eastern margin of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. The fourth section, for the Permian-Triassic boundary is from Meishan, China, the type section for this boundary, and was deposited on the western margin of another one of the continental blocks {{at the edge of the}} Paleo-Tethys Ocean. The biomarker evidence from these sections was measured in ratios, absolute abundances and for 613 C isotopic values. This evidence points to global marine conditions dominated by bacterial inputs in which photic zone euxinia was prevalent for extended time periods. Additional findings from compound-specific isotope data suggest that at isolated intervals, the chemocine may have extended even closer to the surface. The timing of these intervals implies that ocean conditions may have affected the extinction itself. by Lindsay Elizabeth Hays. Thesis (Ph. D.)
