The instant the word was given, the two apparitions sprang forward and began to rain blows down upon each other with such lightning rapidity that I could not quite tell whether I saw the swords or only flashes they made in the air; the rattling din of these blows as they struck steel or <b>paddings</b> was something wonderfully stirring, and they were struck with such terrific force that I could not understand why the opposing sword was not beaten down under the assault.

60|$|I {{should have}} mentioned, that shortly after Toby’s disappearance, perceiving the {{uncertainty}} of the time I might be obliged to remain in the valley,—if, indeed, I ever should escape from it,—and considering that my whole wardrobe consisted of a shirt and a pair of trousers, I resolved to doff these garments at once, in order to preserve them in a suitable condition for wear, should I again appear among civilized beings. I was consequently obliged to assume the Typee costume, a little altered, however, to suit my own views of propriety, and in which I have no doubt I appeared to as much advantage as a senator of Rome enveloped in the folds of his toga. A few folds of yellow tappa, tucked about my waist, descended to my feet in the style of a lady’s petticoat, only I did not have recourse to those voluminous <b>paddings</b> in the rear with which our gentle dames are in the habit of augmenting the sublime rotundity of their figures.

Imagine him on a furze-sprinkled golf links. Then stays, an efficient substitute for the effete feminine backbone. So the thing goes on. Long ago his superficies became artificial, and now the human being shrinks like a burning cigar, and the figure he has abandoned remains distended with artificial ashes, dead dry protections against the exposures he so unaccountably fears. Will he go on shrinking, I wonder?--become at last a mere lurking atomy in his own recesses, a kind of hermit crab, the bulk of him a complex mechanism, a thing of rags and tatters and papier-maché, stolen from {{the earth and the}} plant-world and his fellow beasts? And at last may he not disappear altogether, none missing him, and a democracy of honest machinery, neatly clad and loaded up with sound principles of action, walk to and fro in a regenerate world? Thus it was my mind went dreaming in St. George's Hall. But presently, as I say, came the last word about stomachs, and the bald men woke up, rattled their umbrellas, said it was vastly interesting, and went toddling off home in an ecstasy of advanced Liberalism.

40|$|Abstract. BLINKER is a {{light-weight}} cryptographic suite {{and record}} protocol built {{from a single}} permutation.

We motivate these enhancements by showing that unlike legacy protocols, the resulting record protocol is secure against a two-channel synchronization attack while also having a significantly smaller implementation footprint. The design facilitates security proofs directly from a single cryptographic primitive (a single security assump-tion) rather than via idealization of multitude of algorithms, <b>paddings</b> and modes of operation. The protocol is also uniquely suitable for an autonomous or semi-autonomous hardware implementation of protocols where the secrets never leave the module, making it attractive for smart card and HSM designs...|$|E

40|$|RSA-FDH {{and many}} other schemes secure in the Random-Oracle Model (ROM) require a hash {{function}} with output size larger than standard sizes. We show that the random-oracle instantiations proposed in the literature for such cases are weaker than a random oracle, including the proposals by Bellare and Rogaway from 1993 and 1996, and the ones implicit in IEEE P 1363 and PKCS standards: for instance, there is a practical 230 preimage attack on BR 93 for 1024 -bit digests. Next, we study the security impact of hash function defects for ROM signatures. As an extreme case, we note that any hash collision would suffice to disclose the master key in the IDbased cryptosystem by Boneh et al. from FOCS ’ 07, and the secret key in the Rabin-Williams signature for which Bernstein proved tight security at EUROCRYPT ’ 08. Interestingly, for both of these schemes, a slight modification can prevent these attacks, while preserving the ROM security result. We give evidence {{that in the case}} of RSA and Rabin/Rabin-Williams, an appropriate PSS padding is more robust than all other <b>paddings</b> known. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Strong {{security}} notions often introduce strong {{constraints on}} the construction of cryptographic schemes: semantic security implies probabilistic encryption, while the resistance to existential forgeries requires redundancy in signature schemes. Some <b>paddings</b> have thus been designed in order to provide these minimal requirements to each of them, in order to achieve secure primitives. A few years ago, Coron et al. suggested the design of a common construction, a universal padding, which one could apply for both encryption and signature. As a consequence, such a padding has to introduce both randomness and redundancy, which does not lead to an optimal encryption nor an optimal signature. In this paper, we refine this notion of universal padding, in which a part can be either a random string in order to introduce randomness or a zero-constant string in order to introduce some redundancy. This helps us to build, with a unique padding, optimal encryption and optimal signature: first, in the random-permutation model, and then in the random-oracle model. In both cases, we study the concrete sizes of the parameters, for a specific security level: The former achieves an optimal bandwidth. ...|$|E

40|$|We propose several highly-practical and {{optimized}} constructions {{for joint}} signature and encryption primitives {{often referred to}} as signcryption. All our signcryption schemes, built directly from trapdoor permutations such as RSA, share features such as simplicity, efficiency, generality, near-optimal exact security, flexible and ad-hoc key management, key reuse for sending/receiving data, optimally-low message expansion, “backward ” use for plain signature/encryption, long message and associated data support, the strongest-known qualitative security and, finally, complete compatibility with the PKCS# 1 infrastructure. Similar to the design of plain RSA-based signature and encryption schemes, such as RSA-FDH and RSA-OAEP, our signcryption schemes are constructed by designing appropriate padding schemes suitable for use with trapdoor permutations. We build a general and flexible framework for the design and analysis of secure Feistelbased padding schemes, as well as three composition paradigms for using such <b>paddings</b> to build optimized signcryption schemes. To unify many secure padding options offered as special cases of our framework, we construct a single versatile padding scheme PSEP which, by simply adjusting the parameters, can work optimally with any of the three composition paradigms for either signature, encryption, or signcryption.
