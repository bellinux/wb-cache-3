40|$|The {{technical}} and economic feasibility of energy recovery, using of a reverserunning pump, {{has been carried}} out. Water flow and pressure data for an underground <b>pressure-reducing</b> <b>station,</b> at Anglogold Ashanti Mponeng mine, was used. A statistical analysis resulted in a design flow and pressure. Turbine curves for a HPH 28 - 1 S pump were provided by Sulzer and regression models were used to predict system performance. Variable and constant speed systems were proposed. The expected energy recovered would be 318. 5 kW and 319. 1 kW for the variable and constant speed systems, respectively. The discharge water temperature for both systems would be 10. 32 °C. The constant speed system was preferred since the capital cost (R 3 776 900) and payback period was lower (2. 3 years), while the NPV (R 11 645 000) and IRR (42. 9...|$|E
40|$|The Facilities and Operations (F&O) Directorate is {{sponsoring}} a continuous process improvement (CPI) program. Its {{purpose is to}} stimulate, promote, and sustain a culture of improvement throughout {{all levels of the}} organization. The CPI program ensures that a scientific and repeatable process exists for improving the delivery of F&O products and services in support of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Management Systems. Strategic objectives of the CPI program include achieving excellence in laboratory operations in the areas of safety, health, and the environment. Identifying and promoting opportunities for achieving the following critical outcomes are important business goals of the CPI program: improved safety performance; process focused on consumer needs; modern and secure campus; flexibility to respond to changing laboratory needs; bench strength for the future; and elimination of legacy issues. The Steam <b>Pressure-Reducing</b> <b>Station</b> (SPRS) Safety and Energy Efficiency Improvement Project, which is under the CPI program, focuses on maintaining and upgrading SPRSs {{that are part of the}} ORNL steam distribution network. This steam pipe network transports steam produced at the ORNL steam plant to many buildings in the main campus site. The SPRS Safety and Energy Efficiency Improvement Project promotes excellence in laboratory operations by (1) improving personnel safety, (2) decreasing fuel consumption through improved steam system energy efficiency, and (3) achieving compliance with applicable worker health and safety requirements. The SPRS Safety and Energy Efficiency Improvement Project being performed by F&O is helping ORNL improve both energy efficiency and worker safety by modifying, maintaining, and repairing SPRSs. Since work began in 2006, numerous energy-wasting steam leaks have been eliminated, heat losses from uninsulated steam pipe surfaces have been reduced, and deficient pressure retaining components have been replaced. These improvements helped ORNL reduce its overall utility costs by decreasing the amount of fuel used to generate steam. Reduced fuel consumption also decreased air emissions. These improvements also helped lower the risk of burn injuries to workers and helped prevent shrapnel injuries resulting from missiles produced by pressurized component failures. In most cases, the economic benefit and cost effectiveness of the SPRS Safety and Energy Efficiency Improvement Project is reflected in payback periods of 1 year or less...|$|E
50|$|Thanks to its {{entry points}} with Germany, Belgium and France, Luxembourg {{is linked to}} the {{interconnected}} gas networks throughout Europe. Monitored by Dispatching Gas, the high and medium-pressure pipelines carry the gas to sixty or so communes that are connected to the national gas network. <b>Pressure-reducing</b> <b>stations</b> that supply the local networks then reduce the gas pressure. Creos ensures the distribution of natural gas in 45 communes. Since 1 October 2015, Creos and its Belgian counterpart Fluxys Belgium, in collaboration with their respective regulators ILR and CREG, have merged the two national markets into one single Belux market. This integration, {{the first of its kind}} between two European Union member states, reflects the willingness of the European Union to create a borderless European gas market,,,.|$|R

40|$|Cheap and {{reliable}} electricity {{is an essential}} stimulus for economic and social development. Currently fossil fuels are used {{for the majority of}} global electricity generation, but energy shortages and pressure on all industries to reduce CO 2 emissions provide incentives for growing emphasis on the development of alternative energy-generation methods. Presently hydropower contributes about 17 % of global energy generation, which is only a fraction of its total potential. In Africa only 5 % of its estimated hydropower potential has been exploited, making it the most underdeveloped continent in terms of hydropower. An often overlooked source of hydropower energy is found in conduits, where <b>pressure-reducing</b> <b>stations</b> (PRSs) are installed to dissipate excess energy. The energy dissipated by these devices can instead be captured as hydroelectricity if turbines are installed in the conduits, either by replacing pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) with a turbine, or by installing the turbine in parallel with the PRV. An initial scoping investigation indicated that significant potential exists for small-scale hydropower installations in water-distribution systems in South Africa. Almost all of the country’s municipalities and water-supply utilities have pressure-dissipating stations in their water-distribution systems, where hydropower potential may exist. This dissertation reflects the development of a Conduit Hydropower Decision Support System (CHDSS), summarised in a series of flow diagrams that illustrate the developmental process (Figure i(a) provides an example). A Conduit Hydropower Development (CHD) Tool was developed to facilitate the calculation of necessary factors (the Phase 1 Economic Analysis is shown in Figure i(b)). The objective of this CHDSS was to assist municipalities and engineers in identifying conduit hydropower potential in South Africa and to provide proper guidance for the development of potential sites.
