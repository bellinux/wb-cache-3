40|$|<b>Policy</b> <b>advice</b> {{can help}} {{political}} actors design and implement institutional reforms through {{the generation of}} political and substantial legitimacy. This article clarifies the institutional pre-conditions of effective supply and transfer of <b>policy</b> <b>advice</b> with particular respect {{to the field of}} labor market and social policy reform and to corporatist arrangements where academic think tanks and social partner bodies for <b>policy</b> <b>advice</b> exist side by side. It shows how <b>policy</b> <b>advice</b> is structured and to what it extent it could influence actual policy-making in Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden over the last decade. Our main argument is that the structure of <b>policy</b> <b>advice</b> is essential for its effectiveness, with highly reputable and less contested expert committees and research institutes providing balanced policy-oriented advice are most influential and conducive to furthering labor market and welfare state reforms in corporatist settings. In combination with a shadow of hierarchy spent by government they can also facilitate social partner consensus. Hence, an appropriate supply of <b>policy</b> <b>advice</b> can help ensure sufficient legitimacy for institutional reforms and increase societal problem-solving capacities. If government is weak for institutional reasons and <b>policy</b> <b>advice</b> rather fragmented, challenged and less policy-oriented, like in the German case, <b>policy</b> <b>advice</b> can not realize its full potential...|$|R
40|$|The World Resources Institute is a {{research}} and policy institute helping governments, the private sector, environmental and development organizations and others in their concern for meeting human needs while conserving natural resources and the environment. Its central task is to build bridges between scholarship and action, bringing the insights of scientific research, economic analysis and practical experience {{to the attention of}} policy makers and other leaders around the world. WRI is an independent, nonprofit-making organization, which receives its financial support from private foundations, governmental and intergovernmental institutions, private organizations and interested individuals. It is currently carrying out policy research projects in such subject areas as forests and biodiversity, marine resource conservation and the economics of sustainable agriculture. Studies are also being made of the implications of a changing global climate on world resources. In developing countries, WRI's Centre for International Development and Environment provides <b>policy</b> <b>advice,</b> technical <b>programme</b> support, training, data management and information dissemination for governments and NGOs. The WRI publications catalogue describes 57 books including World Resources 1990 - 1991, which contains tables, charts and Figures containing economic, demographic, environmental and natural resource late for 146 countries. in collaboration with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), WRI has established the Biodiversity Conservation Strategy Programme (See Spore 29 - Newslines). The Programme's ultimate goal is to help humanity to use biological resources in a sustainable and equitable manner that does not critically reduce the biosphere's overall diversity. Update, an 8 -page newsletter, provides news and announcements about the Strategy and it is hoped that it will stimulate input into its development.

40|$|Part I {{contrasts}} {{the general}} types of <b>policy</b> <b>advice</b> that follow {{from three different}} approaches to understanding economic growth and technological change. Neoclassical theory gives <b>policy</b> <b>advice</b> that {{is assumed to be}} relevant for all countries at all times: remove sources of 'market failures'. Romer's branch of new macro growth theory stresses the nature of knowledge, non-rivalrous and partly appropriable. Structuralist-evolutionary theory is micro based and stresses the uncertainty that is associated with technological advance. Both of the latter approaches conclude that the neoclassical optimal allocation of resources is unachievable and hence the <b>policy</b> <b>advice</b> of removing impediments to achieving that optimum is not well grounded. As a result, <b>policy</b> <b>advice</b> for enhancing technological change must rely on a mixture of theory, empirical analysis and policy judgement. Part II deals with the large amount of context-specific <b>policy</b> <b>advice</b> that follows from structuralist-evolutionary theories.

40|$|In {{the present}} {{internal}} report we review {{the literature on}} <b>policy</b> <b>advice.</b> In particular we focus on what we know and what we don’t know on policy advisory systems and <b>policy</b> <b>advice</b> utilisation. We do this by employing a traditional narrative review method. In order to add some rigour in the review process we organise the material around key themes and questions that emerge as important in the literature. This is done in three sections. First, {{we begin with a}} discussion on the very definition of <b>policy</b> <b>advice.</b> Does <b>policy</b> <b>advice,</b> presently defined as a background concept, adequately delimit our field of enquiry or should we better construct a systematised one? In the second section we proceed with an examination of what the literature says on policy advisory systems. What are policy advisory systems and how may the <b>policy</b> <b>advice</b> process be conceptualised within them? More importantly what do past studies reveal on policy advisory system configuration and why are they structured the way they do? How do such systems change in time and towards what direction? What can be said on the determinants of actors and their influence? Finally, the third section deals with <b>policy</b> <b>advice</b> utilisation. We present literature insights on three crucial issues: a) how may we conceive use of <b>policy</b> <b>advice,</b> b) who are the users of advice and why do they seek advice, c) what determines use of advice?nrpages: 33 status: publishe...|$|R

Special emphasis is laid on discussing the potential and possible limitations of agent-based models for economic <b>policy</b> <b>advice.</b> The editorial provides an overview on the role of agent-based modeling in economic policy referring also to the papers presented. Furthermore, it highlights the strength of the approach, i. e., the explicit microfoundation and the modeling of heterogenous agents. Finally, we also report on current limitations of the method with regard to economic <b>policy</b> <b>advice</b> and point at some areas deserving further research.

In this framework, stakeholder engagement has received growing attention but is often neglected by the academic community, possibly due {{to the complexity of}} a multi-stakeholder approach in knowledge-based <b>policy</b> <b>advice.</b> In this regard, platforms with online mechanisms particularly show promising potential to engage a diverse set of stakeholders, so-called quadruple helix stakeholders, throughout the development of smart specialisation strategies.
