The VOC families studied in this work were alkenes, alkynes, <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes</b> and amines. Solubility predictions in the form of infinite dilution activity coefficients were made using the Modified UNIFAC Dortmund group contribution model, and were computed using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet specifically designed for this purpose. It was found that, with the exception of cyclopentadiene, alkene activity coefficients decreased slightly with increasing temperature thereby generally deviating from ideality. Solubility of alkyne interactions with unsaturated esters increased with increasing temperature, but decreased with saturated ester interactions for the terminal alkynes. With the exception of trichloromethane <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkane</b> activity coefficients decreased with increasing temperature, thus deviating from ideality.

40|$|This paper reviews recent {{investigations}} by Slater {{and colleagues}} into the metabolic activation of <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes</b> {{in general and}} carbon tetrachloride in particular. It is becoming increasingly accepted that free radical intermediates {{are involved in the}} toxicity of many such compounds through mechanisms including lipid peroxidation, covalent binding, and cofactor depletion. Here we describe the experimental approaches that are used to establish that <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes</b> are metabolized in animal tissues to reactive free radicals. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy is used to identify free-radical products, often using spin-trapping compounds. The generation of specific free radicals by radiolytic methods is useful in the determination of the precise reactivity of radical intermediates postulated to be injurious to the cell. The enzymic mechanism of the production of such free radicals and their subsequent reactions with biological molecules is studied with specific metabolic inhibitors and free-radical scavengers. These combined techniques provide considerable insight into the process of metabolic activation of halogenated compounds. It is readily apparent, for instance, that the local oxygen concentration at the site of activation is of crucial importance to the subsequent reactions; the formation of peroxy radical derivatives from the primary free-radical product is shown to be of great significance in relation to carbon tetrachloride and may be of general importance. However, while these studies have provided much information on the biochemical mechanisms of <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkane</b> toxicity, it is clear that many problems remain to be solved...|$|R

30|$|The {{ability of}} Dehalogenimonas spp. to reductively dechlorinate high {{concentrations}} of <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes</b> {{has important implications for}} cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater. Abiotic transformation of these chemicals in the environment is generally quite slow. For example, the environmental half-life of 1, 2 -DCA from abiotic transformation in water was estimated to be 50 years ([Vogel et al., 1987]). Unlike chlorinated ethe nes (e.g., tetrachloroethene and trichloroethene), several of the polychlorinated etha nes and propa nes, 1, 2 -DCA in particular, are resistant to transformation by zero-valent iron ([Sarathy et al., 2010]; [Song and Carraway, 2005]), limiting physicochemical remediation approaches for cleanup.

Both dehalogenases show a broad substrate specificity, allowing the degradation of bromine- and chlorine-substituted organic compounds.

Previous studies on reductive dechlorination of <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes</b> have generally been conducted in a relatively narrow range of low (e.g., 0.1 to 0.5 mM) contaminant concentrations ([Chen et al., 1996]; [De Wildeman et al., 2003]; [Fletcher et al., 2009]; [Grostern and Edwards, 2006, 2009]; [Lorah and Olsen, 1999]; [Maymó-Gatell et al., 1999]; [Yan et al., 2009 a]). Contaminant concentrations considerably higher than this range are present at some sites, however, particularly in areas where pollutants remain in the subsurface as dense non-aqueous-phase liquids (DNAPLs) ([Bowman et al., 2006]; [Marzorati et al., 2007]; [Yan et al., 2009 b]).|$|R

50|$|All general {{anaesthetics}} induce immobilization (absence {{of movement}} in response to noxious stimuli) through depression of spinal cord functions, whereas their amnesic actions are exerted within the brain. According to the Meyer-Overton correlation the anaesthetic potency of the drug is directly proportional to its lipid solubility, however, there are many compounds that do not satisfy this rule. These drugs are strikingly similar to potent general anaesthetics and are predicted to be potent anaesthetics based on their lipid solubility, but they exert only one constituent of the anaesthetic action (amnesia) and do not suppress movement (i.e. do not depress spinal cord functions) as all anaesthetics do. These drugs {{are referred to as}} nonimmobilizers. The existence of nonimmobilizers suggests that anaesthetics induce different components of anaesthetic effect (amnesia and immobility) by affecting different molecular targets and not just the one target (neuronal bilayer) as it was believed earlier.

The epoxide of vinyl chloride and the epoxide of trichloroethene, which temporarily accumulated in the medium, were chemically degraded according to first-order kinetics, with half-lives of 78 and 21 s, respectively. Cells expressing sMMO actively degraded the epoxide of cis- 1, 2 -dichloroethene but not the epoxide of trans- 1, 2 -dichloroethene.

The catalytic performance of the resulting catalyst samples in the hydrodechlorination (HDCl) of 1, 2 -dichloroethane at 220 ºC was investigated, to gain understanding of metal alloying phenomena governing the variation in ethene selectivity with time on stream (TOS).

The so obtained microheterogeneous catalyst can induce biomimetic redox processes on organic substrates in aqueous medium, using sunlight and oxygen as clean reagents. The primary photochemical process consists in the photoinduced reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) with the contemporaneous oxidation of the axial ligand to radical species. The micelle environment may control some main parameters affecting the reactivity of these intermediates and, therefore, the chemoselectivity of the hydrocarbon oxidation processes.

30|$|The coupled triple enzyme {{reaction}} {{described here}} allows fast simple and sensitive detection of haloalkanes but {{depending on the}} nature of the sample to be analysed several potentially limiting conditions have to be carefully considered. It has been reported that certain dehalogenases are inhibited by halides (Schindler et al., [1999]). In the case when R. erythropolis DhaA is used, presence of halide salts in concentrations up to 80 [*]mM should not disturb the reaction (Schindler et al., [1999]). It should also be noted that the signal generation in our method can similarly be triggered by traces of alcohols in the sample. In this case, it may be advisable to preincubate the analyte solution with AOX and a catalase to oxidize the alcohol to the corresponding aldehyde and to remove the hydrogen peroxide generated. Subsequent inactivation of catalase, e.g. by addition of 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole or 4 -hydroxypyrazole (Mac[Donald and Pispa 1980], Margoliash et al., [1960]), allows one to apply the standard procedure described above. Like other methods relying on the determination of halide content (Holloway et al., [1998], Kurtovic et al., [2007], [Marchesi 2003]), this assay does not allow to distinguish between individual alkyl halides if a multicomponent mixture of haloalkanes is present in a sample. Since different <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes</b> give rise to distinct sensitivity and reaction rates, knowledge of the haloalkane composition of a sample would be required.

Renal cortex has high activities of cytochrome P 450 and glutathione (GSH) S-transferase. In contrast, renal medulla has high activity of prostaglandin synthetase, which can catalyze co-oxidation of xenobiotics. While these pathways are found in many tissues and at higher activities than in kidney, several key enzymes of the mercapturic acid pathway are found at especially high activities in cells of the renal proximal tubule. Investigations {{over the last two}} decades demonstrated that GSH conjugation is not only a mechanism for detoxification of reactive electrophiles. Rather, metabolism of GSH S-conjugates to the corresponding cysteine S-conjugates represents a branch point: cysteine S-conjugates may be metabolized by the cysteine S-conjugate N-acetyl-transferase to mercapturic acids, which are nontoxic and are excreted, or they may be substrates for the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent cysteine conjugate beta-lyase, which catalyzes either a beta-elimination or a transamination reaction to produce unstable thiols. These thiols rearrange to form potent acylating species that can covalently bind to cellular macromolecules, thereby producing cytotoxicity, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity. In addition to the beta-lyase, two other renal enzymes, L- 2 -amino (2 -hydroxy) acid oxidase and cysteine conjugate S-oxidase, can bioactivate chemicals to produce nephrotoxic species. Several <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes</b> and alkenes are bioactivated by these pathways. These findings show that mammalian kidney is highly active in bioactivation of xenobiotics.

With increasing public health concerns {{for the effects of}} Disinfection By-Products (DBPs), there are considerable benefits in developing Quantitative Structure and Activity Relationship (QSAR) models capable of accurately predicting Log P. In this research, Log P values of 173 DBP compounds in 6 functional classes were used to develop QSAR models, by applying 3 molecular descriptors, namely, Energy of the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (ELUMO), Number of Chlorine (NCl) and Number of Carbon (NC) by Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) analysis. The QSAR models developed were validated based on the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) principles. The model Applicability Domain (AD) and mechanistic interpretation were explored. Considering the very complex nature of DBPs, the established QSAR models performed very well with respect to goodness-of-fit, robustness and predictability. The predicted values of Log P of DBPs by the QSAR models were found to be significant with a correlation coefficient R 2 from 81 % to 98 %. The Leverage Approach by Williams Plot was applied to detect and remove outliers, consequently increasing R 2 by approximately 2 % to 13 % for different DBP classes. The developed QSAR models were statistically validated for their predictive power by the Leave-One-Out (LOO) and Leave-Many-Out (LMO) cross validation methods. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation was used to assess the variations and inherent uncertainties in the QSAR models of Log P and determine the most influential parameters in connection with Log P prediction. ^ The developed QSAR models in this dissertation will have a broad applicability domain because the research data set covered six out of eight common DBP classes, including <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkane,</b> <b>halogenated</b> alkene, halogenated aromatic, halogenated aldehyde, halogenated ketone, and halogenated carboxylic acid, which have been {{brought to the attention of}} regulatory agencies in recent years. Furthermore, the QSAR models are suitable to be used for prediction of similar DBP compounds within the same applicability domain. The selection and integration of various methodologies developed in this research may also benefit future research in similar fields. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} model is presented {{that can be}} used as a tool in the design of safer chemicals. This model predicts the rate of hydrogen-atom abstraction by cytochrome P 450 enzymes. Excellent correlations between biotransformation rates and the calculated activation energies (delta Hact) of the cytochrome P 450 -mediated hydrogen-atom abstractions were obtained for the in vitro biotransformation of six <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes</b> (1 -fluoro- 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrachloroethane, 1, 1 -difluoro- 1, 2, 2 -trichloroethane, 1, 1, 1 -trifluro- 2, 2 -dichloroethane, 1, 1, 1, 2 -tetrafluoro- 2 -chloroethane, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2,-pentafluoroethane, and 2 -bromo- 2 -chloro- 1, 1, 1 -trifluoroethane) with both rat and human enzyme preparations: In(rate, rat liver microsomes) = 44. 99 - 1. 79 (delta Hact), r 2 = 0. 86; In(rate, human CYP 2 E 1) = 46. 99 - 1. 77 (delta Hact), r 2 = 0. 97 (rates are in nmol of product per min per nmol of cytochrome P 450 and energies are in kcal/mol). Correlations were also obtained for five inhalation anesthetics (enflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane, methoxyflurane, and isoflurane) for both in vivo and in vitro metabolism by humans: In[F(-) ]peak plasma = 42. 87 - 1. 57 (delta Hact), r 2 = 0. 86. To our knowledge, these are the first in vivo human metabolic rates to be quantitatively predicted. Furthermore, this is one of the first examples where computational predictions and in vivo and in vitro data have been shown to agree in any species. The model presented herein provides an archetype for the methodology that may be used in the future design of safer chemicals, particularly hydrochlorofluorocarbons and inhalation anesthetics...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{we found}} that Alcanivorax {{bacteria}} from various marine environments were capable of degrading <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes.</b> Genome sequencing of A. dieselolei B- 5 revealed two putative haloalkane dehalogenase (HLD) genes, which {{were supposed to be}} involved in degradation of halogenated compounds. In this report, we confirm {{for the first time that}} the Alcanivorax bacterium encodes a truly functional HLD named DadB. An activity assay with 46 halogenated substrates indicated that DadB possesses broad substrate range and has the highest overall activity among the identified HLDs. DadB prefers brominated substrates; chlorinated alkenes; and the C 2 -C 3 substrates, including the persistent pollutants of 1, 2 -dichloroethane, 1, 2 -dichloropropane and 1, 2, 3 -trichloropropane. As DadB displays no detectable activity toward long-chain haloalkanes such as 1 -chlorohexadecane and 1 -chlorooctadecane, the degradation of them in A. dieselolei B- 5 might be attributed to other enzymes. Kinetic constants were determined with 6 substrates. DadB has highest affinity and largest k cat/K m value toward 1, 3 -dibromopropane (K(m) = 0. 82 mM, k(cat) /K(m) = 16. 43 mM(- 1) · s(- 1)). DadB aggregates fast in the buffers with pH ≤ 7. 0, while keeps stable in monomer form when pH ≥ 7. 5. According to homology modeling, DadB has an open active cavity with a large access tunnel, which is supposed important for larger molecules as opposed to C 2 -C 3 substrates. Combined with the results for other HLDs, we deduce that residue I 247 plays an important role in substrate selection. These results suggest that DadB and its host, A. dieselolei B- 5, are of potential use for biocatalysis and bioremediation applications...|$|R

40|$|GST (glutathione transferase) T 1 - 1 {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the biotransformation of <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes,</b> which are used in large quantities as solvents and occur as environmental pollutants. Many reactions that are catalysed by GST T 1 - 1 qualify as detoxification processes, but some reactions with dihalogenated alkanes lead to reactive products more toxic than the substrates. Murine GST T 1 - 1 is particularly active with dichloromethane, which may explain the high carcinogenicity of dichloromethane in the mouse. Human GST T 1 - 1 activity is considerably lower with halogenated hydrocarbons and some related substrates. Human GST T 1 - 1 is polymorphic with a frequent null phenotype, suggesting that it is advantageous, under some circumstances, to lack the functional enzyme, which catalyses GSH conjugations that may cause bioactivation. The present study shows that amino acid residue 234 is a determinant of the differences in catalytic efficiency between the human and the rodent enzymes. The replacement of Trp 234 in human GST T 1 - 1 by arginine, found in the rodent enzyme, enhanced the alkyltransferase activity by an order of magnitude with a series of homologous iodoalkanes and some typical GST substrates. The specific activity of the alternative mutant Trp 234 →Lys was lower than for the parental human GST T 1 - 1 with many substrates, showing that a positive charge is not sufficient for increased activity. The enhanced activity of Trp 234 →Arg with alkylating agents was dependent on the substrate tested, whereas no increase of the peroxidase activity with cumene hydroperoxide was noted. Residue 234 therefore is also involved in the control of the substrate selectivity of GST T 1 - 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{have made}} a {{literature}} survey and performed a critical analysis of the available experimental surface tension data for the most volatile compounds in petroleum fluids: nitrogen, methane, ethane, propane, i-butane, n-butane, n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane and n-octane. Including the selected data with those for oxygen, xenon, krypton and those obtained recently for 16 <b>partially</b> <b>halogenated</b> hydrocarbons (refrigerants), we propose the following extended scaled equation to represent the surface tension of these substances:σ=kTc(NAVc) 2 / 3 (4. 35 + 4. 14 ω) t 1. 26 (1 + 0. 19 t 0. 5 - 0. 25 t) where t= 1 -T/Tc is reduced temperature, k, NA, Vc, and ω are the Boltzmann constant, Avogadro number, the critical volume and the acentric factor, respectively. This equation, which only differs slightly from that proposed by Schmidt et al. [J. W. Schmidt, E. Carrillo-Nava, M. R. Moldover, Fluid Phase Equilibria 122 (1996) 187 - 206] for refrigerants, yields values for σ within 3. 5 % of the experimental values for all these compounds. Available data for other compounds (refrigerants) are in agreement with this relation; {{in the light of}} that we also examine some compounds (carbon dioxide and argon) for which there exist conflicting datasets...|$|R
40|$|We have charted a symmetry-based {{approach}} to complex, dimeric {{members of the}} pyrrole–imidazole family of alkaloids; palau'amine, axinellamines, massadines and ageliferin. New methods to prepare and manipulate bis-guanidine containing intermediates in this context are discussed. These efforts culminated in the synthesis of a <b>partially</b> <b>halogenated</b> variant of the complete (±) -axinellamine A ring system and the total synthesis of (±) -ageliferin from a common spirocyclopentane intermediate. A novel N-amidinyliminium ion rearrangement was examined for the requisite ring-expansion to provide the 2 -aminotetrahydrobenzimidazole core of ageliferin directly. This method was applied to epimeric intermediates to obtain structurally novel tetracycles coined ‘iso’axinellamines. We proposed access to (±) -axinellamine A via controlled oxidation and subsequent ring-contraction of (±) -ageliferin. This led us to examine oxidative methods for the transformation of 2 -aminotetrahydrobenzimidazoles. Progress toward the synthesis of (−) -ageliferin via the oxidative desymmetrization of symmetric 2 -aminotetrahydrobenzimidazole intermediates is discussed. Additionally, we report synthetic access to functionalized 3, 3 '-bipyrrolidines, coined ‘dispacamide dimer precursors’, for the synthesis of complex pyrrole&# 8722;imidazole dimers. The dimeric framework was obtained by a diastereoselective, nickel-catalyzed reductive homocoupling of an unactivated secondary bromide derived from trans- 4 -hydroxy-L-proline. Dimeric precursors were desymmetrized by an auto-oxidative process. The method involves a cascading sequence of indiscrete oxidation and guanidine incorporation events followed by desymmetrization...|$|R
