5|$|Although it {{has survived}} years of wear and warfare, {{one of the}} palace's wings is now in danger of {{collapsing}} into the Black Sea below. Cracks have begun {{to appear in the}} library, housing almost 10,000 books and manuscripts. Although Edward Blore had a state-of-the-art drainage system built into the palace's foundation, years of neglect and the construction of a nearby sewage pipe in 1974 have helped to increase the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> landslide. Another potential looming disaster is surrounding the medieval-style gatehouse near the palace's west side.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion is metabolized in {{the liver}} by the {{cytochrome}} P450 isoenzyme CYP2B6. It has several active metabolites: R,R-hydroxybupropion, S,S-hydroxybupropion, threo-hydrobupropion and erythro-hydrobupropion, which are further metabolized to inactive metabolites and eliminated through excretion into the urine. Both bupropion and its primary metabolite hydroxybupropion act {{in the liver}} as potent inhibitors of the enzyme CYP2D6, which metabolizes not only bupropion itself but also {{a variety of other}} drugs and biologically active substances. This mechanism creates the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> variety of drug interactions.|$|E

5|$|In February 1918 General Mannerheim {{weighed the}} {{question}} of where to focus the general offensive of the Whites, between two strategically vital enemy strongholds: Tampere, Finland's major industrial town in the south-west, and Viipuri, Karelia's main city. Although seizing Viipuri offered major advantages, the lack of combat skills of his army and <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> major counterattack by the enemy in the area or in the south-west made it too risky.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{recognised}} that biogas (mainly methane) – produced from the anaerobic digestion {{of organic matter}} – is potentially a valuable and prolific feedstock. It is estimated that 0.4 GW of generating capacity might be available from agricultural waste in Scotland. The Scottish Executive and SEPA has funded seven small scale farm trial plants with the British anaerobic digestion company Greenfinch in Southwest Scotland. Landfill sites have the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> further 0.07 GW with sites such as the Avondale Landfill in Falkirk already utilising their potential.|$|E
5|$|Malaria {{vaccines}} {{have been}} an elusive goal of research. The first promising studies demonstrating the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> malaria vaccine were performed in 1967 by immunizing mice with live, radiation-attenuated sporozoites, which provided significant protection to the mice upon subsequent injection with normal, viable sporozoites. Since the 1970s, {{there has been a}} considerable effort to develop similar vaccination strategies for humans. The first vaccine, called RTS,S, was approved by European regulators in 2015.|$|E

5|$|A {{more ambitious}} plan by Butlin was thought up {{on a trip}} to the Bahamas in 1946. Seeing <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> camp in warmer climes, he formed a company under the {{chairmanship}} of Sir Bede Edmund Hugh Clifford and bought land in Grand Bahama. Butlin also purchased the Princess hotel in Bermuda and the Fort Montagu beach hotel in Nassau. The camp was intended to be complete and open on New Years Day of 1950. After an investment of US$5 million (2011:£) the camp opened, still only partially complete, in the winter of 1949. To celebrate its opening, Butlin ran a mystery flight, where guests, who had paid $129 (2011:£) each, were taken on a flight to the resort without being informed in advance.|$|E
5|$|July 1986 was {{an unusually}} active month for {{moderate}} to strong earthquakes in California, with three events occurring {{in less than}} two weeks, each with mild to moderate effects. The first of these shocks came on July 8 with a M6.0 event on the Banning fault near Palm Springs and the second event occurred off the coast of Oceanside as a M5.8 shock on July 13. While the earthquake off the southern California coast occurred in an area thought to be capable of generating a tsunami, the earthquake near Palm Springs occurred on a portion of the southern San Andreas Fault system that has been designated a seismic gap, and is a likely location for a very large earthquake. The same seismic gap theory (regarding the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> future large earthquake) had also been presented for the White Mountains area near Chalfant.|$|E

5|$|One {{year after}} Arthur's death, Henry VII renewed his efforts of sealing a marital {{alliance}} with Spain by arranging for Catherine to marry Arthur's brother Henry, who had by then become Prince of Wales. Arthur's untimely death {{paved the way}} for Henry's accession as Henry VIII in 1509. The <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> question as to the consummation of Arthur and Catherine's marriage, was much later (and in a completely different political context) exploited by Henry and his court to cast doubt on the validity of Catherine's union with Henry, eventually leading to the separation between the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
5|$|Some 2010 {{structural}} {{comparisons of}} Stegosaurus plates to Alligator osteoderms {{seem to support}} {{the conclusion that the}} <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> thermoregulatory role in the plates of Stegosaurus definitely exists. This hypothesis has been seriously questioned,> since its closest relatives, such as Kentrosaurus, had more low surface area spikes than plates, implying that cooling was not important enough to require specialized structural formations such as plates. Another possible function is that the plates may have helped the animal increase heat absorption from the sun. Since a cooling trend occurred {{towards the end of the}} Jurassic, a large ectothermic reptile might have used the increased surface area afforded by the plates to absorb radiation from the sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Manuel {{can be traced}} back to a {{tropical}} wave that left the African continent in late August. The wave entered the Caribbean Sea on September 5, although the northern portion of the wave axis later developed into Hurricane Ingrid. On September10, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> low-pressure area to develop off the southwest coast of Mexico during the subsequent few days, provided the system remained offshore. The next day, a low formed while it was nearly stationary, accompanied by scattered convection. Strong wind shear and proximity to land were expected to limit development, although conditions became more favorable on September12. On that day, the convection became better organized. At 1200UTC on September13, the NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Thirteen-E, noting that the system had enough of a well-defined circulation and convection. By that time, wind shear had diminished and warm waters were expected to allow intensification, and the main inhibiting factors for development were proximity to Mexico and association with the intertropical convergence zone.|$|E

5|$|The storm {{developed}} as an Alberta clipper-type {{low pressure area}} that moved southeastward across the Great Plains and Midwest. Throughout North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa, moderate snowfall accompanied the system. After weakening over the Ohio Valley, the storm redeveloped {{off the coast of}} North Carolina. In the days preceding the event, a cyclone over eastern Canada circulated cold air southward. Computer models indicated the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> major storm up to seven days in advance; however, initially, certain forecasts suggested that a separate storm over the southern U.S. would merge with the clipper. Instead, this feature moved out to sea.|$|E
5|$|Three {{publishers}} praised The Well {{but turned}} it down. Hall's agent then sent the manuscript to Jonathan Cape who, though cautious about publishing a controversial book, saw the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> commercial success. Cape tested the waters {{with a small}} print run of 1500 copies, priced at 15 shillings– about twice {{the cost of an}} average novel– to make it less attractive to sensation-seekers. Publication, originally scheduled for late 1928, was brought forward when he discovered that another novel with a lesbian theme, Compton Mackenzie's Extraordinary Women, was to be published in September. Though the two books proved to have little in common, Hall and Cape saw Extraordinary Women as a competitor and wanted to beat it to market. The Well appeared on 27 July, in a black cover with a plain jacket. Cape sent review copies only to newspapers and magazines he thought would handle the subject matter non-sensationally.|$|E
5|$|Widespread precautionary {{measures}} took place across Hawaii as forecasts indicated the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Hawaiian landfall {{as early as}} August2. Then-governor Neil Abercrombie signed an emergency proclamation into effect, and numerous government facilities were closed. Several airlines cancelled flights servicing the archipelago. Upon making landfall, Iselle brought torrential rainfall and caused strong winds which resulted in widespread power outages and downed trees. The storm caused heavy crop damage, estimated at $66million (2014USD), including 60% of the state's papaya that was lost. This was enough to be classified as an agriculture disaster, and was eventually declared a disaster by Federal Emergency Management Agency after initially being denied. The storm also killed one person on Kauai {{as a result of}} flooding.|$|E
