25|$|Biofeedback {{therapy for}} facial synkinesis aims to {{increase}} the patient’s awareness of the facial muscle posture and movement. Facial muscles contain few to none intrinsic muscle sensory receptors (used for <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>feedback)</b> and additionally they do not span movable joints and so lack joint receptors (another source for <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>feedback).</b> Thus, biofeedback allows the patient to actively sense the motion of their muscles. The two common forms of biofeedback used are electromyographic feedback and mirror feedback. Electromyographic feedback includes visual EMG signals (coming from facial muscle sites displayed to the patient from a computer {{in the form of}} waveform traces) or auditory signals that indicate strength of muscle contraction. The subsequent role of the patient is to control the movement of undesired muscle during volitional movement by incorporating the information perceived through the EMG. While mirror feedback is a much more basic way of providing the patient feedback on muscle movement, studies have shown that both are very effective options for synkinesis/paresis reduction. Biofeedback is commonly coupled to facial retraining techniques to achieve maximal effectiveness.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{seeks to}} ascertain the relative value of visual and <b>proprioceptive</b> motion <b>feedback</b> during force-based control of a non-self entity like a powered prosthesis. Accurately controlling such a device is very difficult when the operator cannot see or feel the movement that results from applied forces. As an analogy to prosthesis use, we tested {{the relative importance of}} visual and <b>proprioceptive</b> motion <b>feedback</b> during targeted force-based movement. Thirteen human subjects performed a virtual finger-pointing task in which the virtual finger’s velocity was always programmed to be directly proportional to the MCP joint torque applied by the subject’s right index finger. During successive repetitions of the pointing task, the system conveyed the virtual finger’s motion to the user through four combinations of graphical display (vision) and finger movement (proprioception). Success rate, speed, and qualitative ease of use were recorded, and visual motion feedback was found to increase all three performance measures. <b>Proprioceptive</b> motion <b>feedback</b> significantly improved success rate and ease of use, but it yielded slower motions. The results indicate that <b>proprioceptive</b> motion <b>feedback</b> improves human control of targeted movement in both sighted and unsighted conditions, supporting the pursuit of artificial proprioception for prosthetics and underscoring the importance of motion feedback for other force-controlled human-machine systems, such as interactive virtual environments and teleoperators...|$|R
40|$|During a motor task, {{a causal}} {{relation}} occurs between the motor command {{generated in the}} cortex and the <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>feedbacks</b> that go from the activated muscles through the corticospinal pathway. This causal relation is of interest in neurorehabilitation to improve motor function for people with motor difficulties. Previous neurorehabilitation methods used external stimulation to modify the corticospinal pathway controlling the motor function of the affected body parts. An alternative to these approaches is to reinforce the corticospinal pathway by identifying the cortical motor command naturally generated when a person imagines or attempts a movement, and combine it with peripheral nerve stimulation. The research group of Professor D. Farina has developed a method exploiting Brain–computer Interface technology to detect the cortical motor command {{and use it to}} trigger peripheral nerve stimulation in order to reinforce the efficiency of the corticospinal pathway. A detailed description of the method and an interview with Prof. D. Farina is presented in this chapter...|$|R
40|$|Patients {{with type}} 2 {{diabetic}} neuropathy (DN) are at {{an increased risk of}} falls due to the decreased accurate <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>feedbacks.</b> Effective balance training should treat context-specific instabilities of postural control of patients with DN. For this purpose, evaluations and balance training were designed with a 3 -week baseline with evaluation after 3 weeks, followed by training over 3 weeks with reevaluation. We acquired control scores for standing balance from the Biodex stability system and fluctuations of the center of pressure. We performed repeated measure analysis of variance to test mean differences in three sessions of assessments. In addition, we compared mean differences of each pair of sessions with the least significant difference test. We used the paired t-test to compare the pure effects of trainings. Our investigation showed that the results of Biodex stability scores and force platform medial-lateral sway measurements improved statistically. Significant higher open-eyes median and mean frequency values of postural sway in the medial-lateral direction indicated that balance training allowed patients to develop control over the degree of freedom at the hip joint. In conclusion, training that compensates for disordered balance indicated by subclinical constraints with respect to the guidance effect of external visual feedback improves standing postural control in patients with type 2 D...|$|R

40|$|Background. In healthy subjects, {{observation}} of actions activates a motor network {{similar to that}} involved {{in the performance of}} the observed actions. Movement observation could perhaps be applied to functionally sustain brain motor functions when efferent motor commands and <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>feedbacks</b> are disconnected. Objective. The authors examined whether observation-induced brain activation is preserved in people with chronic complete spinal cord injury (SCI). Methods. Nine patients and 12 healthy subjects underwent behavioral assessment and functional magnetic resonance imaging. The SCI patients attempted to perform dorsal and plantar flexions of the right foot, and the controls also executed the same movement. Both groups observed subsequent video clips showing the same movement. Results. In the SCI group, attempted and observed foot movements activated a common observation-execution network including ventral premotor, parietal cortex, and cerebellum as in healthy subjects. Conclusions. Long after onset of complete SCI, the brain maintains its ability to respond to task-specific visual inputs, which suggests preservation of motor programs. This persistence might be a prerequisite for repair strategies of the spinal cord that rely on appropriate activation of the brain to try to restore limb function. The preserved cortical network may offer an additional motor rehabilitation approach for people with SCI...|$|R
40|$|Aging is {{characterized}} by brain structural changes that may compromise motor functions. In the context of postural control, white matter integrity is crucial for the efficient transfer of visual, <b>proprioceptive</b> and vestibular <b>feedback</b> in the brain.

A force platform was used to measure changes in body posture under conditions of compromised <b>proprioceptive</b> and/or visual <b>feedback.</b> In the young group, no significant brain structure-balance relations were found. In the elderly however, the integrity of a cluster in the frontal forceps explained 21 % of the variance in postural control when proprioceptive information was compromised.

Nevertheless, neuronal circuits regulating the activation of antagonistic extensor-flexor muscles remain poorly understood. Here we use monosynaptically restricted trans-synaptic viruses to elucidate premotor anatomical substrates for extensor-flexor control in mice. We observe a medio-lateral spatial segregation between extensor and flexor premotor interneurons in the dorsal spinal cord. These premotor interneuron populations are derived from common progenitor domains, but segregate by timing of neurogenesis. We find that <b>proprioceptive</b> sensory <b>feedback</b> from the periphery is targeted to medial extensor premotor populations and is required for extensor-specific connectivity profiles during development.

40|$|Recently, {{we studied}} corticomuscular {{coherence}} (CMC) in a visuomotor task and showed {{for the first}} time gamma-range (30 – 45 Hz) CMC during isometric compensation of a periodically modulated dynamic force. We speculated that for the control of such forces, the sensorimotor system resonates at gamma-range frequencies to rapidly integrate the visual and proprioceptive information and produce the appropriate motor command. In this study, we tested the role of the <b>proprioceptive</b> afferent <b>feedback</b> on gamma-range CMC by comparing the deafferented patient GL to six age- and sex-matched subjects during the performance of a visuomotor force task consisting of isometric compensation of static and dynamic forces applied on the finger.

Instead, she had only beta-range CMC as in the static force condition; concurrently, her performance was significantly worse than that of the controls in both conditions.

This paper proposes a theoretical model that allows a robot to interactively estimate the pairwise similarity between everyday objects and use this knowledge to solve the odd one out task. That is, given a set of objects, the robot’s task is to select the one object that does not belong in the group. In our experiments, the robot interacted with fifty different household objects (by applying five different exploratory behaviors on them) and perceived auditory and <b>proprioceptive</b> sensory <b>feedback.</b> Pairwise object similarity was estimated for different behavior and modality contexts. In a series of subsequent tests, three objects from a given category (e. g., three cups or three pop cans) along with one object from outside that category were selected and the robot’s internal models were queried to pick the object that does not belong in the group. The object similarity relations learned by the robot were used to pick the most dissimilar object, with success rates varying from 45 % to 100 %, depending on the category. The results show that the learned similarity measures were sufficient to capture some of the common properties of human-defined object categories, such as cups, bottles, and pop cans. I. ...|$|R

Due to the extreme efforts needed to achieve improvements during synkinesis, Nakamura et al. observed that patients will often fail to reach their desired goal because of the difficulty of maintaining motivation during training. The desired course of action is to catch the patient shortly after facial nerve trauma and teach the patient biofeedback techniques.

While {{it is possible to}} produce rhythms like forward swim and caudal scratch with a hip dominated architecture as explored in this work, different synaptic weights (and, therefore, a different network) are necessary. It is an open problem to ascertain whether a single network could produce all four patterns. One possible approach to this problem would be the use of genetic algorithms to derive optimal CPG network structures [42, 43] or to determine the parameter values necessary to coordinate multiple CPGs to generate multiple rhythms [34]. It is not clear what would constitute a practically useful objective function for a genetic algorithm approach, however. Including more of the known details about the ionic currents in turtle motoneurons [23] would be another way to tie our modeling more closely to the biology of turtle motor rhythms in future works.

This disruption causes a cortical reorganization that may be functionally maladaptive. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate whether it is possible to prevent this reorganization by compensating for the lack of actual kinesthetic perception with illusory movements induced by ``neuromimetic'' proprio-tactile feedback that is artificially delivered during immobilization. Sixteen healthy volunteers were equipped for five days with full-hand ortheses that prevented them from performing finger and hand movements but allowed for kinesthetic and tactile sensations. Eight participants received a twice-daily proprio-tactile treatment consisting of the perception of kinesthetic sensations resembling those felt during actual movements generated by miniature vibrators set in the ortheses at the finger and wrist levels. Eight untreated participants received no stimulation. The effects of hand immobilization and treatment were assessed by fMRI during a calibrated voluntary hand movement task and hand tactile stimulation before cast placement and immediately after cast removal. We found that the sensorimotor network was preserved in subjects who underwent this treatment during hand immobilization, while the sensorimotor network of untreated subjects was significantly altered. These findings suggest that sensory feedback and associated movement perception may counteract disuse-induced cortical plastic changes through recruitment of {{a large part of the}} cortical network used for actual performed movement. The possibility of guiding cortical plasticity with <b>proprioceptive</b> augmented <b>feedback</b> is potentially relevant for rehabilitation efforts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
