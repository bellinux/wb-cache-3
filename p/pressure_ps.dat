5000|$|MM5 is {{globally}} relocateable, {{which helps}} support different latitudes, terrain types, elevations, soil types, etc[...] The {{model can be}} either hydrostatic or non-hyrdrostatic, depending on the desired outcome. The fact that the model is regional implies that it requires initial conditions and lateral boundary conditions. This means that each boundary (there are four) has initialized wind speeds, temperatures, pressure and moisture fields. Thus, gridded data is needed for this program. This model takes and then analyzes its data based on pressure surfaces. However, these surfaces must first be interpolated by a specific vertical coordinate {{before it can be}} analyzed. [...] This vertical coordinate, sigma, is computed and then used throughout the program. Σ is defined as:Σ = (p-pt)/p*, p* = ps-pt, Where p is <b>pressure,</b> <b>ps</b> is surface pressure, and pt is the pressure {{at the top of the}} model. When Σ is close to the ground, the program follows the actual terrain, but when Σ is higher up, the program looks at isobaric surfaces. Σ ranges from 0 to 1. [...] It has adaptable and multiple nesting capabilities, which allows multiple programs to run at once, while utilizing 2-way nesting. MM5 features inputs from actual data, which is helpful because routine observations can be used. Then, data can be compared and used in context with other models. [...] MM5 also features terrain-following vertical coordinates and four-dimensional data assimilation (FDDA) [...] FDDA is used when there is a lot of data that was taken over a longer period of time. Then this data that needed to be taken over a longer period of time gets placed into FDDA. It is also utilized for dynamical initialization and four-dimensional data sets. Most importantly, MM5 is well documented and has many places for user support.|$|E

Based on the latest estimated DDT emission, the DDT concentrations in air, soil, water, and sediment as well as the transfer flux were simulated under the equilibrium and steady-state assumption. Model predictions suggest that soil and sediment was the dominant sink of DDT. The results showed that the model predicted was generally good agreement with field data. Compared with degradation reaction, advection outflow was more important in removal processes of DDT. Sensitivities of the model estimates to input parameters were tested. The result showed that vapour <b>pressure</b> (<b>Ps),</b> chemical solubility (Cs), and absolute temperature (T) of DDT were the most influential parameters for the model output.
