In the game, Giants manager Roger Craig made what some {{describe}} as a questionable pinch hitting substitution. In order to contest Hershiser with a left-handed batter, with runners on first and second and one out, he substituted rookie Francisco Meléndez (batting [...]190) for Robby Thompson (batting [...]266), which resulted in an inning-ending double play. That day, USA Today claimed Dodgers' manager Tommy Lasorda had determined his postseason pitching rotation with Hershiser slated for game one of the NLCS, but Lasorda denied having any <b>plan</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> for a playoff appearance {{that had not yet}} been clinched.

In 2004, the government's Interdepartmental Working Group on Trafficking in Persons was mandated to create a national anti-human-trafficking plan, but the mandate went unfulfilled despite reminders from politicians and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Member of Parliament (MP) Joy Smith put forward motion C-153 in February 2007 to put a <b>plan</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> and the House of Commons passed it unanimously.

Measures that did not pass included tougher measures to curb illegal immigration advocated by Williams and raising the legal age for dropping out of high school from sixteen to eighteen, a proposal supported by Beshear. Also, the Assembly was unable to agree on whether to adopt Beshear's plan to address a shortfall in the state's Medicaid obligations or an alternative plan proposed by Williams. Beshear's plan involved moving $166 million from the second year of the biennial budget to cover the shortfall and cover the costs in the second year through savings achieved by switching to a managed care plan for Medicaid. Williams' plan, passed by the Republican majority in the state senate, called for $101 million in cuts to state government spending to cover the shortfall. Without a <b>plan</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> Beshear estimated that the state would have to cut Medicaid reimbursements to health care providers by 30 percent.|$|E

Shortly afterward, he was promoted to the Columbus Senators of the American Association, and in 1928 he posted a [...]333batting average with them. His performance that season earned him an American Association All-Star position. During the season, he personally asked Detroit's owner, Frank Navin, if the organization had a <b>plan</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> to bring him up to the Tigers. Navin told him to be patient and return to Columbus. When the season concluded, another Columbus catcher, Hugh McMullen, was called up to the major leagues, but to the Cincinnati Reds instead of the Tigers. Confused as to who actually owned his contract, Ferrell inquired with the Reds about his status with the organization, and was again told to return to Columbus. After reading through his contract, he believed he was being unfairly held in the minor leagues, so he petitioned the Commissioner of Baseball, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, to grant him a hearing. It was discovered that Columbus owner, Joseph Carr, had been shopping Ferrell's contract, receiving offers as high as $50,000 (...) , though none were formally presented on paper. Navin protested to Landis, claiming he was unaware of what Carr was doing. After the Commissioner completed his investigation, he determined that the Tigers and Reds had colluded to keep Ferrell in the minor leagues, and directed Carr to shop for buyers. This move by the two teams effectively hid him from the other major league teams' draft rights to increase Ferrell's sale price. This was a common, although illegal, practice during this era, so Landis declared Ferrell a free agent, allowing him to sign a contract with any team he chose, except the Tigers. After receiving offers from many major league clubs, he signed a contract with the St. Louis Browns of the AL for $25,000 (...) [...]|$|E

Often used together, the terms Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery are very different. Business Continuity refers to the ability of a business to continue critical functions and business processes after the occurrence of a disaster, where as Disaster Recovery refers specifically to the Information Technology (IT) and data-centric functions of the business, and is a subset of Business Continuity.|$|E

2500|$|During Powell's {{tenure at}} the NGA, he has faced several challenges. In May 1994, the NGA learned that its painting, The Holy Family on the Steps, was a forgery and not the work of 17th-century French painter Nicolas Poussin. Powell was {{strongly}} criticized for not ordering the relabeling of the painting in a timely manner, and for mishandling the NGA's response to its critics. In December 1994, D.C. television station WJLA ran a three-part exposé titled [...] "Gallery of Shame", in which the station revealed the content of a confidential report that criticized the NGA for severe lapses in maintenance, environmental control, and art storage. The report said that these conditions [...] "threaten {{the security of the}} collection" [...] and placed works of art [...] "at risk" [...] of [...] "serious damage." [...] The report documented a leaky roof, dripping skylights, flooded storerooms, and burst radiators that poured clouds of steam into galleries. In one case, a poorly maintained humidifier turned the varnish on John Singleton Copley's Watson and the Shark an opaque white. (The painting was restored with no damage.) [...] The report also strongly criticized the management structure at the museum, documented very low employee morale, and uncovered poor minority hiring practices. Powell attacked WJLA's report as [...] "hyperbole and exaggeration", and said that not a single work of art had been damaged. He also said that the NGA had been aware of the problems for several years, and that he already had a <b>plan</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> to implement the consultants' recommendations within 12 months.|$|E
