5|$|Offside has {{a unique}} {{implementation}} in field lacrosse. Instituted with rule changes in 1921, it limits the number of players that are allowed {{on either side of}} the midfield line. Offside occurs when there are fewer than three <b>players</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> offensive side of the midfield line or when there are fewer than four <b>players</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> defensive half of the midfield line (note: if players are exiting through the special-substitution area, it is not to be determined an offside violation).|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} {{undergone}} significant changes since Beers' original codification. In the 1930s, {{the number of}} <b>players</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field per team was reduced from twelve to ten, rules about protective equipment were established, and the field was shortened.|$|E

5|$|After an {{unsuccessful}} interview at Liverpool, Shankly moved to manage Grimsby Town in June 1951. He {{said in his}} autobiography that there was greater potential at Grimsby than at Carlisle. His main problems were that Grimsby had been relegated twice in recent seasons, dropping from the First to the Third Division, and some good players had been transferred before he arrived. But Shankly believed he still had good players {{to work with and}} was able to buy some additional <b>players</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> transfer market for low fees.|$|E
5|$|At {{the first}} tournament in 1920, {{there were many}} {{differences}} from the modern game: games were played outdoors on natural ice, forward passes were not allowed, the rink (which had been intended to be used only for figure skating) was 56m×18m (165ft×58.5ft) and two 20-minute periods were played. Each team had seven <b>players</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ice, the extra position being the rover. Following the tournament, the IIHF held a congress and decided to adopt the Canadian rules—six men per side and three periods of play.|$|E
5|$|Australia's openers Morris and Barnes {{successfully}} {{negotiated the}} new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 without loss after 15 minutes.

Bradman {{came in and}} the score progressed to 121 before Barnes was caught by wicket-keeper Evans with a one-handed diving effort for 62. Miller was then dismissed for a duck by Laker.|$|E

Pro-Football-Reference.com uses this list as the official All-Pro list of 1920. Twenty of the players were from Illinois and thirteen were from Ohio.

5|$|Higgins {{played on}} minor hockey teams with former Canadiens {{teammate}} Mike Komisarek and former Flames teammate Eric Nystrom, {{both of whom}} he remains close friends with.

5|$|His {{popularity}} {{was such}} that, after he {{enlisted in the}} military, {{so many of his}} fellow Princeton athletes followed his lead that the school had to cancel its hockey team for the 1917–18 season; all five starting players enlisted in the armed forces.

5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear skies greeted the <b>players</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second morning. Barnes batted assuredly, while Morris was hesitant and shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes. Barnes {{was involved in}} some interplay with umpire Chester when the latter stopped a drive from Morris with his foot. Barnes picked the ball off the wicket {{and handed it to}} the bowler, prompting Chester to wag his finger in disapproval. Barnes responded by admonishing the umpire for blocking the ball.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the criticism, tournament organisers ERC agreed to review the penalty {{shoot-out}} system, although they confirmed that they had already considered and dismissed some other possible ways of deciding matches, including replaying the game, having a 'next try wins' rule in extra time, {{reducing the number of}} <b>players</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pitch periodically in extra time to create more space and deciding the game on a coin toss. The format for the penalty shoot-out was changed prior to the following season's tournament, removing the requirement for all <b>players</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field (including forwards) to participate, however for the remainder of its existence, the Heineken Cup retained the penalty shoot-out as the final system for deciding a winner if required. No other Heineken Cup match needed to use it.|$|E
