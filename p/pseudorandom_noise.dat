Broadus [...] "Don" [...] Keele, Jr., {{to create the}} low-frequency rumble, using recordings of the 1971 Sylmar earthquake as a reference. Two low frequency control tones were printed on the film's mono optical or magnetic track; from the projector, the tones entered a control box in the projection booth, which fed low frequency <b>pseudorandom</b> <b>noise</b> to 1,600 watt BGW 750 audio amplifiers driving the speakers. The control box generated a <b>pseudorandom</b> <b>noise</b> signal with energy between 17 and 120 Hz. The control track method was employed {{because there was no}} way to accurately record bass lower than 40 Hz on an optical or magnetic film soundtrack at the time. When receiving the noise signal, the amplifier and subwoofers responded with sound pressures ranging from 100 dB to 120 dB. The resulting rumble could be felt by audience members as well as heard.|$|E

We examine the role of coding in CDMA systems that employ multiuser detection to calculate how much bit error rate (BER) has reduced during the analysis of signal by various techniques. In this paper the DS/CDMA systems with two kinds of receivers, the matched filter and the blind mud receiver are simulated using Mat lab coding. <b>Pseudorandom</b> <b>noises</b> (PN codes) are used as spreading code of user length N= 31.

Using cross-correlation the reproduced signal at the receiving end {{can be used to}} determine the beginning of the second markers much more accurately. The drawback of using phase-modulated time signals lies in the complex instrument grade receiving hardware required for using this time signal reception method. Using this method the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) measured inaccuracies of ± 2 to 22 microseconds, depending on the time in the day and season. This was done in Braunschweig located 273 km from the transmitter in Mainflingen.|$|E

Unlike for the clinical data, the simulations had no injected misregistration. Radioactive decay was not simulated in order to (1) partly compensate for the lack of injected misregistration by increasing the noise to larger levels due to generating Poisson model noise from larger, not decay-diminished signals (2) crosscheck the accuracy of the decay-corrected GDC model used for the clinical cases, (3) simulate drug assay when decay is not a factor, and (4) provide an example of how simulations studies can be used to model variations of experimental conditions and validate techniques.|$|R
40|$|Loudspeakers in car cabins {{often are}} {{installed}} in positions primarily regarding design aspects. Acoustical aspects are mostly subordinate. For this reason loudspeakers frequently radiate against a window, the dashboard or the rear shelf, also a radiation {{to the floor}} room is common. Acoustical reflections at short distances causing interferences of direct and reflected sounds are {{the main reason for}} comb-filter effects at the listening position. For the measurements in this work two stimuli were used: a <b>pseudorandom</b> pink <b>noise,</b> recursively averaged over 15 seconds, when the measurement position was changed, and a sine sweep when the position was fixed during the measurement process. Both, microphone movements and head movements, lead to a robust averaging of the measured magnitude response, reducing significantly both the variations in the response and the comb-filter effects in the car cabin. Frequency responses measured by the process described here require less filtering effort to equalize the loudspeakers in the car cabin...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} an inversion method for 3 D geomagnetic data based on approximation {{of the source}} distribution by means of positive constrained Gaussian functions. In this way, smoothness and positivity are automatically imposed on the source without any subjective input from the user apart from selecting the number of functions to use. The algorithm has been tested with synthetic data in order to resolve sources at very different depths, using data from one measurement plane only. The forward modeling is based on prismatic cell parameterization, but the algebraic nonuniqueness is reduced because a relationship among the cells, expressed by the Gaussian envelope, is assumed to describe the spatial variation of the source distribution. We assume {{that there is no}} remanent magnetization and that the magnetic data are produced by induced magnetization only, neglecting any demagnetization effects. The algorithm proceeds by minimization of a (chi) 2 misfit function between real and predicted data using a nonlinear Levenberg-Marquardt iteration scheme, easily implemented on a desktop PC, without any additional regularization. We demonstrate the robustness and utility of the method using synthetic data corrupted by <b>pseudorandom</b> generated <b>noise</b> and a real field data set...|$|R

A voice playing Triangle waveform may be ring-modulated {{with one of the}} other voices, where the triangle waveform's bits are inverted when the modulating voice's msb is set, producing a discontinuity and change of direction with the Triangle's ramp.

In addition, all operating satellites are numbered with a space vehicle identifier (SV ID) and <b>pseudorandom</b> <b>noise</b> number (PRN number) which uniquely identifies the ranging codes that a satellite uses. There is a fixed one-to-one correspondence between SV identifiers and PRN numbers described in the interface specification. Unlike SVNs, the SV ID/PRN number of a satellite may be changed (also changing the ranging codes it uses). At any point in time, any SV ID/PRN number is in use by at most a single satellite. A single SV ID/PRN number {{may have been used}} by several satellites at different points in time and a single satellite may have used different SV ID/PRN numbers at different points in time. The current SVNs and PRN numbers for the GPS constellation may be found at NAVCEN.|$|E

The signal can be modulated by the redirecting host for purposes such as radio-frequency identification and traffic control (radar target echo enhancement).The first adaptive array, the side-lobe canceller, was developed by Paul Howells and Sid Applebaum at General Electric in 1959 to suppress radar jamming signals. Building on Norbert Wiener’s work with analog filters, in 1960 Stanford University professor Bernard Widrow and PhD student Ted Hoff developed the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm that automatically adjusts an antenna’s directivity pattern to reinforce desired signals.Ted Compton at Ohio State University developed an adaptive antenna technique for recovering direct sequence spread spectrum signals {{in the presence of}} narrowband co-channel interference. Compton’s method, reported in 1974, only requires knowledge of the desired signal’s <b>pseudorandom</b> <b>noise</b> (PN) code—not its direction of arrival. In the late 1970s, Kesh Bakhru and Don Torrieri developed the maximin algorithm for recovering frequency hopping signals in the presence of narrowband co-channel interference.A 1977 paper by Bell Labs researchers Douglas O. Reudink and Yu S. Yeh described the advantages of scanning spot beams for satellites. The authors estimated that scanning spot beams could save 20 dB in link budget which in turn could be used to reduce transmit power, increase communication capacity, and decrease the size of earth-station antennas. Satellite spot beams are used today by direct broadcast satellite systems such as DirecTV and Dish Network.|$|E
40|$|An {{omnidirectional}} {{sound source}} {{is commonly used}} in room acoustical measurements. The omnidirectional directivity is usually approached by placing 12 loudspeakers in a regular 12 -face polyhedron, called a dodecahedron. In the ISO 3382 - 1 standard on the measurement of room acoustical parameters, limits are imposed on the maximum allowable deviation from omnidirectional directivity of the sound source. If this deviation approaches the limits, it is recommended to take a rotational average over at least three positions around the source. The average over three equal-angular positions in the horizontal plane of a dodecahedron sound source proves to be unreliable due to the particular geometry of the dodecahedron. In this research, {{the impact of the}} stepwise rotation method on the measured directivity deviation of a dodecahedron sound source is investigated. This is done by determining the maximum directivity deviation from rotation measurements over a whole number of equal-angular steps varying from 1 to 8. The measurements have been performed in a concert hall at 1, 5 and 18 meters distance using a standard dodecahedron loudspeaker, a turntable and stationary <b>pseudorandom</b> white <b>noise.</b> It was found that the maximum directivity deviation from average within the critical distance of a dodecahedron sound source is ± 2 dB, when determined from 3 equal-angular positions. Only when using 5, 7 or 8 equal-angular positions, the maximum directivity deviation is reduced to ± 0. 5 dB at all distances. PACS no. 43. 55. Cs, 43. 58. Fm 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} resting, whole semitendinosus muscle of the frog have been characterized as functions of both muscle length and temperature. Measurements were made of <b>pseudorandom</b> white <b>noise</b> (PRWN) displacements (less than 10 A/half-sarcomere) applied to the muscle and the force responses to these movements. Signal correlation techniques were then used to obtain the dynamic modulus function for the muscle in the frequency range 2. 44 - 320 Hz. This function was represented by a series combination of a Voigt element and a time delay element for tension propagation along the muscle. A dynamic elastic modulus (E), coefficient of damping (B), and tension transmission velocity (V) were measured for resting muscle {{on the basis of}} this model. For each of these parameters, a marked variation with sarcomere length (s) was found. The mean values for E and B at LO (s= 2. 25 mum) were 1. 84 +/- 0. 24 X 10 (5) N/m 2 and 2. 33 +/- 0. 25 X 10 (2) Ns/m 2, respectively. Further, B demonstrated a negative temperature dependence, Q 10 = 0. 78 (P less than 0. 05), in the range s= 2. 6 - 3. 0 mum, while E was not significantly temperature dependent. The length-dependent variations of E and B are interpreted as deriving from both passive muscle elements and attached crossbridges. Velocity was calculated at a single displacing frequency for every experiment; the mean value at LO and all temperatures was v= 11. 7 +/- 0. 6 m/s. Velocity was also calculated as a function of frequency within several experiments: the results indicate considerable variation of v with frequency...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-four rapidly {{adapting}} (RA) cutaneous afferents {{were recorded}} from a preparation of isolated, innervated hairy {{skin from the}} rat hindlimb {{for the purpose of}} identifying the mechanical variables associated with the initiation of afferent discharge. Neurons were studied while the skin was stretched dynamically along a single direction {{with the use of a}} linear actuator and a feedback controller. Input signals were load- or displacement- controlled stretches that followed either periodic or <b>pseudorandom</b> Gaussian <b>noise</b> control signals. When the tissue was actuated, loads and displacements were measured along the direction of stretch and neuronal responses were recorded. All RA afferents were activated by dynamic stretching. None had a sustained response to static stretch. Cross-correlation products, calculated between neuronal responses and either stress- or strain-related variables observed at the time of the spike, revealed a strong relationship between neuronal responses and tensile stress. Neuronal responses were observed at rates of change of stress between + 1, 000 and - 800 kPa/s. Neuronal responses were poorly related to skin strain. Two loading conditions were used along the direction transverse to the stretch. In one condition the sides were unconstrained, so that on axial loading there was zero stress and negative strain along the transverse axis. In the other condition the sides were constrained so that when the tissue was loaded axially there was zero strain and positive stress along the transverse axis. In these two conditions the same level of axial stress was associated with two levels of axial strain. The neuronal responses were determined by the stress and not the strain. Neuronal responses were observed at stresses > 5 kPa. It appears that RA afferents make little contribution to signaling limb movements or position in rat hindlimb on the basis of the behavior of rat hindlimb skin, as observed when the limb is rotated...|$|R

40|$|Tendons and ligaments are {{uniaxial}} viscoelastic connective tissues and, during normal activity, tendons transmit {{forces from}} muscles to bones, while ligaments stabilize the joints. Many experiments {{have been carried}} out to study ligaments and tendons mechanical properties [1], and the effects of training protocols [2] or specific pathologies. Recently, different transgenic mice models have been proposed as a new way to study in depth tendons’ function and development [3]. Within this context, we made use of pathological and transgenic animal models to investigate the morpho-functional interaction between muscles with an altered functionality and their tendons. In a previous work, by using the animal model of human Duchenne dystrophy, mdx, we found out that tendons connected to muscles with functional defects present reduced mechanical properties and an altered balance between alive and dead cells [4]. Here, we evaluated whether hypertrophic muscles would also involve alterations in tendon biomechanical properties. To do this, we used the transgenic animal model MLC/mIgf- 1, were the local form of Igf- 1 is over-expressed under a muscle specific promoter [5] inducing an increase in skeletal muscle mass and a proportional increment of force. To determine tendons’ elastic and viscous response separately, complex compliance has been computed with a new experimental method [6] which uses a <b>pseudorandom</b> Gaussian <b>noise</b> (PGN) to stimulate all the frequencies of interest within its bandwidth. Elasticity determines the tissue response to loading while viscous dissipation affects the likelihood of injuries to tendons. Indeed, knowing tendinous tissue viscoelasticity is central to better understand the mechanism between energy dissipation and tissue injuries. Finally, the hypothesis that changes in tendons’ mechanical properties could be correlated with alterations in the balance between alive and dead cells has been tested with an in situ cellular analysis...|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} of on-line identification of linear system characteristics from sensory systems with spike train or analog voltage outputs {{was developed and}} applied to the semicircular canal. A <b>pseudorandom</b> binary white <b>noise</b> input was cross-correlated with the system's output to produce estimates of linear system unit impulse responses (UIRs), which were then corrected for response errors of the input transducers. The effects of variability in the system response characteristics and sensitivity were studied by employing the technique with known linear analog circuits. First-order unit afferent responses from the guitarfish horizontal semicircular canal were cross-correlated with white noise rotational acceleration inputs to produce non-parametric UIR models. In addition, the UIRs were fitted by nonlinear regression to truncated exponential series to produce parametric models {{in the form of}} low-order linear system equations. The experimental responses to the white noise input were then compared with those predicted from the UIR models linear convolution, and the differences were expressed as a percent mean-square-error (%MSE). The average difference found from a population of 62 semicircular canal afferents was relatively low mean and standard deviation of 10. 2 +/- 5. 9 SD%MSE, respectively. This suggests that relatively accurate inferences can be made concerning the physiology of the semicircular canal from the linear characteristics of afferent responses...|$|R
