40|$|ABSTRACT: Abnormal synergies in the paretic {{shoulder}} and elbow of hemiparetic subjects were quantified during maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) in 27 subjects {{with a history}} of stroke and 8 age-matched control subjects. A six-axis load cell allowed simultaneous measurement of the <b>primary</b> <b>torque</b> the subject was attempting to maximize and the secondary torques at other joint actions. For example, during MVC of shoulder flexion, shoulder flexion is the <b>primary</b> <b>torque</b> and the secondary torques are inter-nal/external rotation, abduction/adduction, and elbow flexion/extension. In general, the stroke subjects had increased secondary torques compared to controls, resulting in abnormal joint torque coupling within the set consisting of elbow flexion, internal rotation, adduction, shoulder flexion. Unlike previ-ous studies, abnormal secondary torques in several cases were due to strength imbalances, which occur when the strength deficit for a particular joint action is greater than the strength deficit in the opposite joint action. This hypothesis was supported by electromyographic recordings and by the finding that subjects with larger strength imbalances tended to produce larger secondary torques. Possible mechanisms and consequences for rehabilitative treatments are discussed...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe main {{difficulty}} in controlling combustion engine start-up comes from its changing behaviour from load to motor. In {{the context of}} hybrid power trains considered here, the electric motor used for start-up is more powerful than a traditional starter. In {{order to get a}} robust control of the crankshaft speed, we propose to take inspiration from redundant control as formulated in the aeronautic domain (Härkegard, 2003), (Härkegard and Glad, 2005), (Buffington et al., 1996), (Maciejowski, 1997), by considering that the engine and the electric motor are redundant torque providers. Despite that the engine is the <b>primary</b> <b>torque</b> provider, it will be systematically seen as the failing actuator during the start-up stage. Therefore, the electric motor has to compensate its deficiency...|$|E

Design: Subjects performed fatiguing right and left isometric axial rotation of the trunk at 80 % of maximum voluntary contraction while standing upright. Setting: A rehabilitation center. Participants: Twenty-three men with no history of back pain. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Surface electromyographic Signals were recorded from 6 trunk muscles bilaterally. The <b>primary</b> <b>torque</b> in the transverse plane and the coupling torques in sagittal and coronal planes were also measured. Results: During the fatiguing axial rotation contraction, coupling torques of both sagittal and coronal planes were slightly decreased and no difference was found between directions of axial rotation.

40|$|Abstract: GTM have {{developed}} a <b>primary</b> <b>torque</b> standard which covers the range from 1 Nm to 1 kNm with a single load frame and only one weight stack per direction of operation. The design comprises a double-sided lever, supported on strain-controlled elastic hinges, a binary weight stack of exchange disk design for each direction, mounting accessories for the transducer under test and a counter-torque drive with servo-controller. Compared to conventional types with air bearings and a multitude of several stacks, the chosen design offers distinctive advantages: Higher reliability of the lever support, less complicated auxiliary systems, easier method of operation, low overall height. Calculations show that the parasitic moment of the crossed hour-glass shaped springs for the lever support can be controlled to less than 10 - 5 Nm for a 1 kNm machine, and that the uncertainty of lever length falls within a 20 ppm band, including the equality of both sides. Using the same principle of elastic hinges, the overall torque range can be increased to stretch from 0. 1 Nm to over 20 kNm, with only two separate load frames...|$|E

40|$|A {{new design}} of <b>primary</b> <b>torque</b> {{standard}} machines (TSM) with feedback-control of the lever support was described at IMEKO – XVI. World Congress in Vienna [1]. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to present the performance of a hand operated option model in the wide range from 2 N·m up to 3000 N·m. Influences of hand operation are estimated as well as ambient influences like temperature changes and air flow. A protection chamber against the ambient influences was built and the improvement is shown. The TSM has three mass stacks to cover all transducer capacities from 20 N·m up to 3000 N·m in each ten steps. The masses are calibrated within 5 · 10 - 6 by German DKD. The lever arms were precisely adjusted and also DKD-calibrated within 5 · 10 - 6. The adjustment procedure is described. The measurement uncertainty is calculated by the design data according GUM. In addition the best measurement capability of the TSM and the relative deviations are calculated by the results of several torque transfer standards, former calibrated at PTB. Both calculations are compared. The next steps of the upgrade concept – from a hand-operated model to a full-automated model – are illuminated regarding the requirements in Brazil...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn off-spin bowling (finger-spin {{delivery}} with a sidespin, right-handed bowler), {{the ball}} rolls {{over the middle}} finger and rotates counterclockwise, as seen by the batsman. It is therefore expected that the torque imparted onto the ball is generated by the middle finger and the centre of pressure (COP) is also located close to the middle finger. The off-spin bowling action was recorded in five bowlers with a smart cricket ball and the COP was determined. In two bowlers, the COP was located at the middle finger and moved clockwise, i. e. against {{the sense of the}} ball, inherent to rolling motion. In one bowler, the COP was shifted slightly to the index finger, indicating a small contribution by the index to torque generation. Another bowler initiated the torque generation with the index finger, and then the COP moved from index to middle finger. The fifth bowler produced a rare case of braking i. e. deceleration of the ball at release, with the tip of the index finger, as seen in the location of the COP. In this case, the COP moved from the middle finger to the index. This preliminary study of off-spin bowling contributes to the understanding of torque generation, confirming that the <b>primary</b> <b>torque</b> generation is by the middle finger, a mechanism that could be more effective when combined with the torque generation by the index finger...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the between-days reliability of electromyographic (EMG) measurement of 6 bilateral trunk muscles and also the torque output in 3 planes during isometric right and left axial rotation at different exertion levels. Methods: Ten healthy subjects performed isometric right and left axial rotation at 100, 70, 50 and 30 % maximum voluntary contractions in two testing sessions at least 7 days apart. EMG amplitude and frequency analyses of the recorded surface EMG signals were performed for rectus abdominis, external oblique, internal oblique, latissimus dorsi, iliocostalis lumborum and multifidus bilaterally. The <b>primary</b> <b>torque</b> in the transverse plane and the coupling torques in sagittal and coronal planes were measured. Results: For both EMG amplitude and frequency values, good (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC = 0. 75 - 0. 89) to excellent (ICC greater than or equal to 0. 90) reliability was found in the 6 trunk muscles at different exertion levels during axial rotation. The reliability of both maximal isometric axial rotation torque and coupling torques in sagittal and coronal planes were found to be excellent (ICC greater than or equal to 0. 93). Conclusions: Good to excellent reliability of EMG measures of trunk muscles and torque measurements during isometric axial rotation was demonstrated. This provides further confidence of using EMG and triaxial torque assessment as outcome measures in rehabilitation and in the evaluation of the human performance in the work place.

40|$|Calibration {{machines}} up to a {{torque range}} of 20 kN·m need extensive design if the force is performed by dead weights. A machine {{based on two}} force reference standards and a vertical torque axis may serve to avoid these specific problems. The precision force transducers work at a lever arm of precision length. The test piece is mounted in vertical arrangement between a hydraulically operating rotary-actuator and the torque measuring system. Such a calibration machine allows additionally performing easily continuous calibration. Regarding an overall relative uncertainty not greater than 2 · 10 - 4 there are some significant problems. The estimation of the uncertainty has been proved by comparative tests with the national torque standard by the PTB according to the guidelines EA- 10 / 14 and EA- 2 / 03. Boundary conditions The best measuring capability is given by a system with a lever-arm (beam) with direct effect of mass {{and the influence of}} gravity and earth-acceleration (Figure 1).

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{objective}} of this histologic {{study was to determine}} the effect of three drilling protocols (oversized, intermediate, and undersized) on biologic responses to a single implant type at early healing periods (2 weeks in vivo) in a beagle dog model. Materials and methodsTen beagle dogs were acquired and subjected to surgeries in the tibia 2 weeks before euthanasia. During surgery, each dog received three Unitite implants, 4 mm in diameter by 10 mm in length, in bone sites drilled to 3. 5, 3. 75, and 4. 0 mm in final diameter. The insertion torque was recorded during surgery, and bone-to-implant contact (BIC), and bone area fraction occupied (BAFO) measured from the histology. Each outcome measure was compared between treatment conditions with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Bonferroni-corrected statistical significance was set to 95 %. ResultsInsertion torque increased as an inverse function of drilling diameter, as indicated by significant differences in torque levels between each pair of conditions (P= 0. 005). BIC and BAFO levels were highest and statistically similar in the recommended and undersized conditions and significantly reduced in the oversized condition (P< 0. 01). ConclusionsReduced drilling dimensions resulted in increased insertion <b>torque</b> (<b>primary</b> stability). While BIC and BAFO were maximized when drilling the recommended diameter hole, only the oversized hole resulted in evidence of statistically reduced integration...|$|R
30|$|Successful {{integration}} of dental implants is largely {{dependent on their}} primary stability [13]. Implants placed in the maxilla present more challenges due to the poor bone quality usually found in these areas. Another anatomic challenge in the posterior maxilla is the pneumatization of the maxillary sinus which can limit the length of implant that can be placed. To avoid invasive sinus augmentation procedures, implants have been designed in shorter lengths such as 8  mm. To further enhance short implant primary stability, a tapered design has been developed which has been proven to provide greater initial stability [10 – 12, 14]. Implant stability can be evaluated by different measures such as torque {{at the time of}} implant placement, resistance to reverse torque, and resonance frequency analysis (RFA). Multiple studies have established feasibility for validating implant stability in lab and animal models to justify using resonance frequency analysis in clinical trials [15, 16]. Limited literature exists on the OSPTX implant design, and to our knowledge, no clinical studies exist that compare OSP to OSPTX. A recent ex vivo comparison of two different designs of OSPTX implants in porcine mandibles demonstrated that a conical neck design presented higher <b>primary</b> stability (insertion <b>torque</b> and implant stability quotient (ISQ)) than a cylindrical neck design [17]. In our study, both the torque value and ISQ value were recorded at the time of placement. ISQ values were also recorded at implant uncovery at 6  weeks and also at 6 and 12  months when the final restoration was placed.|$|R
40|$|Abnormal {{patterns}} of trunk muscle activity {{could affect the}} biomechanics of spinal movements and result in back pain. The present study aimed to examine electromyographic (EMG) activity of abdominal and back muscles as well as triaxial torque output during isometric axial rotation at different exertion levels in back pain patients and matched controls. Twelve back pain patients and 12 matched controls performed isometric right and left axial rotation at 100 %, 70 %, 50 % and 30 % maximum voluntary contractions in a standing position. Surface EMG activity of rectus abdominis, external oblique, internal oblique, latissimus dorsi, iliocostalis lumborum and multifidus were recorded bilaterally. The <b>primary</b> <b>torque</b> in the transverse plane and the coupling torques in sagittal and coronal planes were measured. Results showed {{that there was a}} trend (P = 0. 08) of higher flexion coupling torque during left axial rotation exertion in back pain patients. Higher activity for external oblique and lower activity for multifidus was shown during left axial rotation exertion in back pain group when compared to the control group. In right axial rotation, back pain patients exhibited lesser activity of rectus abdominis at higher levels of exertion when compared with matched controls. These findings demonstrated that decreased activation of one muscle may be compensated by overactivity in other muscles. The reduced levels of activity of the multifidus muscle during axial rotation exertion in back pain patients may indicate that spinal stability could be compromised. Future studies should consider these alternations in recruitment patterns in terms of spinal stability and internal loading. The findings also indicate the importance of training for coordination besides the strengthening of trunk muscles during rehabilitation process. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand of energy use in transportation systems {{combined with the}} limited supply of fossil hydrocarbons to support conventional engines {{has led to a}} strong resurgence in interest for electric vehicles (EVs). Although EVs offer the possibility of decoupling the issue of energy source from the <b>primary</b> <b>torque</b> generator in an automobile, the current technology is yet to match the well-developed internal combustion (IC) systems, especially in terms of energy capacity and travel range. In this study, the influence of rolling-resistance on the energy efficiency and road holding of electric vehicles is investigated. Rolling resistance is taken in the context of energy loss (e. g. the mechanical energy converted into other sources of energy) for a unit distance traveled by the tire. Considering that the primary factors that affect rolling resistance are pavement features (e. g. texture, stiffness and profile) together with temperature, vehicle speed and tire inflation pressure, a comprehensive simulation study has been conducted utilizing a vehicle model representing chassis dynamics with a battery electric powertrain and a specified tire model to account for rolling-resistance effects. A series of simulations are performed on given urban and highway drive cycles which are determined based on the standard assumption that the vehicle has to be equipped with drive motors that have a combined power of 30 kW in order to overcome the road load during normal driving and {{based on the assumption that}} a specific motor output of approximately 1 kW/kg can be considered to be an appropriate guideline for generic electric motors. At the end, the results are analyzed for estimating the amount of energy that can be saved by reducing such losses and the extended travel range in comparison to available examples of similar results for commercial vehicles in public domain...|$|E
40|$|Study Design. A {{cross-sectional}} case-control study. Objectives. To {{examine the}} effect of fatigue on torque output as well as electromyographic frequency and amplitude values of trunk muscles during isometric axial rotation exertion in back pain patients and to compare the results with a matched control group. Summary of Background Data. Back pain patients exhibited different activation strategies in trunk muscles during the axial rotation exertions. Fatigue changes of abdominal and back muscles during axial rotation exertion have not been examined in patients with back pain. Methods. Twelve back pain patients and 12 matched controls performed isometric fatiguing axial rotation to both sides at 80 % maximum voluntary contraction in a standing position. During the fatiguing exertion, electromyographic changes of rectus abdominis, external oblique, internal oblique, latissimus dorsi, iliocostalis lumborum, and multifidus were recorded bilaterally. The <b>primary</b> <b>torque</b> in the transverse plane and the coupling torques in sagittal and coronal planes were also measured. Results. No difference in the endurance capacity was found between back pain and control groups. At the initial period of the exertion, back pain patients demonstrated a statistical trend (P = 0. 058) of greater sagittal coupling torque as well as lower activity of rectus abdominis and multifidus and higher activity in external oblique. During the fatigue process similar changes of coupling torque were demonstrated in both sagittal and coronal planes, but a smaller fatigue rate for right external oblique, increase in median frequency for latissimus dorsi, and lesser increase in activity for back muscles were found in the back pain group compared with the control group. Conclusions. Alterations in electromyographic activation and fatigue rates of abdominal and back muscles demonstrated during the fatigue process provide insights into the muscle dysfunctions in back pain and may help clinicians to devise more rational treatment strategies.

40|$|PURPOSE: Resonance {{frequency}} analysis (RFA) offers {{the opportunity to}} monitor the osseointegration of an implant in a simple, noninvasive way. A better comprehension {{of the relationship between}} RFA and parameters related to bone quality would therefore help clinicians improve diagnoses. In this study, a bone analog made from polyurethane foam was used to isolate the influences of bone density and cortical thickness in RFA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Straumann standard implants were inserted in polyurethane foam blocks, and primary implant stability was measured with RFA. The blocks were composed of two superimposed layers with different densities. The top layer was dense to mimic cortical bone, whereas the bottom layer had a lower density to represent trabecular bone. Different densities for both layers and different thicknesses for the simulated cortical layer were tested, resulting in eight different block combinations. RFA was compared with two other mechanical evaluations of <b>primary</b> stability: removal <b>torque</b> and axial loading response. RESULTS: The primary stability measured with RFA did not correlate with the two other methods, but there was a significant correlation between removal torque and the axial loading response (P <. 005). Statistical analysis revealed that each method was sensitive to different aspects of bone quality. RFA was the only method able to detect changes in both bone density and cortical thickness. However, changes in trabecular bone density were easier to distinguish with removal torque and axial loading than with RFA. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that RFA, removal torque, and axial loading are sensitive to different aspects of the bone-implant interface. This explains the absence of correlation among the methods and proves that no standard procedure exists for the evaluation of primary stability...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{deformed}} {{or missing}} ears {{try to hide}} their deformities and consequently {{their quality of life}} (QoL) may frequently be compromised. Ear reconstruction by means of autogenous or craniofacial implant-supported appliances may serve to improve QoL of this patient group. The hypothesis {{of the present study was}} that the use of CAD/CAM and rapid prototyping (RP) technology in the fabrication of implant-supported ear prostheses can improve their treatment outcomes and QoL. The over-all aims of the study were to develop innovative techniques using CAD/CAM and RP technology in the fabrication of implant-supported ear prostheses and provide improvement in the treatment outcomes and QoL of patients. The research project was performed with the aim of achieving innovation and advancement in scientific knowledge through the following approaches: 1. To compare the 3 D accuracy of image-guided drillings between Stryker (Nav II iNtellect Cranial, Stryker, Montreux, Switzerland) and BrainLAB (Kolibri Navigation Station 2. 0, BrainLAB, Feldkirchen, Germany) Navigation systems and to assess the inter-operator variability. A custom-made acrylic resin block with attached fiducial markers was drilled by three operators to 6 mm depth of 10 drill holes guided by each navigation system. On comparison between the two systems, slight under-drilling was common for the Stryker system whereas slight over-drilling was common for BrainLAB. The drill hole deviations assessed in two planes found that more deviation occurred with the Stryker system. Inter-operator variability in drilling angles was more common with the Stryker system whereas BrainLAB was more consistent. In one operator, it appeared that there was a learning curve. 2. To present a new concept of visual axis maintenance in the fabrication of ear prostheses. This was shown in a hemifacial microsomia patient wearing spectacles by using a combination of computer planning and CAD/CAM technology. 3. To present an innovative method of integrating image planning and surgical navigation in performing simulation implant surgery on biomodels and the pre-fabrication of ear prostheses. 4. To evaluate the accuracy of surgical planning and implant installation on biomodels. The method was applied on 6 patients’ biomodels in prefabricating their ear prostheses. The accuracy of the surgical planning and the implant installation on the biomodels was considered having minimal deviation in drill depth, entry point in sagittal position and angulation in coronal and axial planes. 5. To present a new method of implant-supported prosthetic ear fabrication composing of a RP framework simulating the cartilage and covered by different thicknesses of silicone skin. 6. To evaluate the treatment outcomes of prosthetic auricular rehabilitation using surgical navigation in osseointegrated implant installation and prosthetic fabrication with CAD/CAM technology. A clinical series of 6 patients were sequentially recruited for prosthetic ear rehabilitation. It was demonstrated that implant-supported ear prosthesis could induce improvement in their QoL particularly in the domains of the body image, social interaction and mood.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{presence}} of abnormal muscle activation patterns {{is a well}} documented factor limiting the motor rehabilitation of patients following stroke. These abnormal muscle activation patterns, or synergies, have previously been quantified in the upper limbs. Presented here are the lower limb joint torque patterns measured in a standing position of sixteen chronic hemiparetic stroke subjects and sixteen age matched controls used to examine differences in strength and coordination between the two groups. Methods With the trunk stabilized, stroke subjects stood on their unaffected leg while their affected foot was attached to a 6 -degree of freedom load cell (JR 3, Woodland CA) which recorded forces and torques. The {{subjects were asked to}} generate a maximum torque about a given joint (hip abduction/adduction; hip, knee, and ankle flexion/extension) and provided feedback of the torque they generated for that primary joint axis. In parallel, EMG data from eight muscle groups were recorded, and secondary torques generated about the adjacent joints were calculated. Differences in mean <b>primary</b> <b>torque,</b> secondary torque, and EMG data were compared using a single factor ANOVA. Results The stroke group was significantly weaker in six of the eight directions tested. Analysis of the secondary torques showed that the control and stroke subjects used similar strategies to generate maximum torques during seven of the eight joint movements tested. The only time a different strategy was used was during maximal hip abduction exertions where stroke subjects tended to flex instead of extend their hip, which was consistent with the classically defined "flexion synergy. " The EMG data of the stroke group was different than the control group in that there was a strong {{presence of}} co-contraction of antagonistic muscle groups, especially during ankle flexion and ankle and knee extension. Conclusion The results {{of this study indicate that}} in a standing position stroke subjects are significantly weaker in their affected leg when compared to age-matched controls, yet showed little evidence of the classic lower-limb abnormal synergy patterns previously reported. The findings here suggest that the primary contributor to isometric lower limb motor deficits in chronic stroke subjects is weakness. </p...|$|E
