40|$|Sleep {{accounts}} for a third of one’s lifetime, partial or complete deprivation of sleep could elicit sever disorders of body function. Previous studies have reported the higher prevalence of sleep disorders in glaucoma patients, but the definite mechanism for this phenomenon is unknown. On the other hand, {{it is well known}} by us that the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) serve additional ocular functions, called non-image-forming (NIF) functions, in the regulation of circadian rhythm, melatonin secretion, sleep, mood and others. Specifically, ipRGCs can directly or indirectly innervate the central areas such as suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), downstream pineal gland (the origin of melatonin), sleep and wake-inducing centers and mood regulation areas, making NIF functions of ipRGCs relate to sleep. The more interesting thing is that previous research showed glaucoma not only affected visual functions such as the degeneration of classical retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), but also affected ipRGCs.

The presence of intraoperative and postoperative complications and the maintenance of severe dysphagia complaints were evaluated in a directed questionnaire, studying association with: the surgical approach chosen, megaesophagus degree, etiology and presence of other digestive alterations. Results: There were 360 cardiomiotomies, 20 esophagectomies and 11 mucosectomies. The results indicate that the cardiomiotomy is the safest surgery and the esophagectomy has more complications. The degree of megaesophagus is directed related with the results; more advanced megaesophagus has the worse results.

Preoperative prediction of the risk of conversion is an important aspect of planning laparoscopic surgery. The purpose of our prospective study was to analyse various risk factors based clinical history, laboratory investigations and imaging and their association with conversion to open. With the help of accurate prediction, high-risk <b>patient</b> <b>maybe</b> informed beforehand regarding the probability of conversion and hence they may have a chance to make arrangements accordingly. On the other hand, surgeons also may have to schedule the time and team for the operation appropriately. Surgeons can also be aware about the possible complications that may arise in high-risk patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients who presented to the Emergency Department in Government Rajaji Hospital with clinical diagnosis of duodenal ulcer perforation during the period of 6 months from March 2015 to August 2015 were prospectively nonrandomised (by consent and cafeteria method) to undergo either laparoscopic or open repair of duodenal ulcer perforation. RESULTS There was no significant difference in duration of symptoms, mean age, ASA grade and mean perforation size in both groups. Analgesic requirement was significantly lower in the laparoscopy group (3. 39 ± 0. 58 vs. 4. 84 ± 0. 66 days). Our patients who underwent laparoscopic repair were enabled to be discharged significantly earlier from the hospital (8. 6 ± 2. 3 vs. 10. 5 ± 3. 9 days. We found that laparoscopic repair did result in earlier return to normal diet (4. 26 ± 0. 81 vs. 4. 87 ± 0. 86 days). Time required for mobilisation of patients was also significantly lower (3. 3 ± 0. 7 vs. 4. 34 ± 0. 62 days).

Methods The records of 484 patients with end-stage renal disease who were on HD or peritoneal dialysis (PD) were reviewed. PAD was diagnosed based on the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI). Demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed. Results PAD had an overall prevalence of 18. 2 % and was significantly more common in HD patients (21. 8 %) than in PD patients (4. 8 %). Advanced age, diabetes mellitus, smoking, low parathyroid hormone level, elevated serum ferritin, elevated serum glucose, and low serum creatinine levels increased the risk for PAD. PAD was independently associated with advanced age, diabetes mellitus, duration of dialysis, low serum creatinine, and hyperlipidemia.

CSF alpha-synuclein levels did not differentiate between diagnostic groups (p= 0. 16). Higher ptau- 181 and higher tau levels differentiated AD from DLB patients (p< 0. 05). In DLB patients, lower Abeta 1 - 42 and higher total tau levels were found than in SC and PD patients (p< 0. 05).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} event-related {{potentials}} (ERPs) and brain topographic maps characteristic {{and change in}} normal controls and subjective tinnitus patients before and after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment. METHODS AND PARTICIPANTS: The ERPs and brain topographic maps elicited by target stimulus were compared before and after 1 -week treatment with rTMS in 20 subjective tinnitus patients and 16 healthy controls. RESULTS: Before rTMS, target stimulus elicited a larger N 1 component than the standard stimuli (repeating sounds) in control group but not in tinnitus patients. Instead, the tinnitus group pre-treatment exhibited larger amplitude of N 1 in response to standard stimuli than to deviant stimuli. Furthermore tinnitus patients had smaller mismatch negativity (MMN) and late discriminative negativity (LDN) component at Fz compared with the control group. After rTMS treatment, tinnitus patients showed increased N 1 response to deviant stimuli and larger MMN and LDN compared with pre-treatment. The topographic maps for the tinnitus group before rTMS -treatment demonstrated global asymmetry between {{the left and right}} cerebral hemispheres with more negative activities in left side and more positive activities in right side. In contrast, the brain topographic maps for patients after rTMS-treatment and controls seem roughly symmetrical. The ERP amplitudes and brain topographic maps in post-treatment patient group showed no significant difference with those in controls. CONCLUSIONS: The characterical changes in ERP and brain topographic maps in tinnitus <b>patients</b> <b>maybe</b> related with the electrophysiological mechanism of tinnitus induction and development.

Univariate methodsand multiple regression analysis were performed to identify predictors of fatigue. Results: Overall, 78 % of the patients indicated that they were experiencing fatigue to some degree. The mean score on the fatigue subscale was 41. 74 ± 26. 91. Of all functional subscales, fatigue showed thestrongest influence on social functioning. Linear regression analyses showed that total fatigue was bestpredicted by pain, appetite loss, body image and type of treatment. Conclusion: Our results support the notion that fatigue in cancer patients is a major problem, whichdeserves yet more attention from health professionals, and that quality of life in cancer patients might beimproved markedly by interventions that effectively reduce fatigue...|$|R
40|$|With the {{increased}} number of geriatric population, it is predicted {{that the need for}} dental treatment also increases. The needs for esthetic factors and function of geriatric <b>patient</b> are <b>maybe</b> similar to young patient. The number of geriatric patients who refuse dental extraction is increasing if there are still other alternative. They can be more convinced when the clinician said that the dental disease experienced is a focal infection so that the loss of the tooth can be accepted as the best option. But if it is possible, they will prefer endodontic treatment, because they want to keep their teeth according to the treatment plan or based on patient's request, as a less traumatic alternative compared to extraction. Endodontic treatment consideration for geriatric patient is quite similar to younger patients. The technique is also the same, although the problem may be bigger. The problem or obstacle that may arise in endodontic treatment for geriatric patient relates to the visit duration, problems during x-ray, problems in defining root canal location, vertical root fracture, and in some cases, decreased pulp tissue recovery ability. Due {{to the fact that the}} challenge is quite big, the success of endodontic treatment in geriatric patients needs to be considered. This paper will explain the endodontic treatment prognosis for geriatric patients...|$|R
