Abstract: Film {{formation}} and their characterization of three eco-friendly polymers, namely gelatin, starch and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH) were studied using {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR), wide-angle X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques. Polymer solutions were prepared using water as a solvent followed by casting. The drying process of the cast sample was monitored at room temperature with a single-sided NMR scanner until complete solidification occurred. Depth-dependent NMR profiles with microscopic resolution were acquired {{at different stages of}} sample drying. Each <b>profile</b> <b>point</b> was accumulated from the echo decay. Spin-spin relaxation times (T 2) were measured from the echo decays at different layers and were correlated with the drying process during film formation. Additionally, spin-lattice relaxation times (T 1) were determined. Depending on the polymer studied and the initial concentration of each polymer, different types of molecular dynamics were observed at different heights during evaporation of the solvent. The study indicates that each polymer shows a spatial heterogeneity in the molecular dynamics during drying. In the advanced stage of drying process, the microscopic arrangement of the polymer chains during their solidification is influenced by this dynamic heterogeneity and determines the final structure of the film. XRD of the film in its final state confirmed the structural heterogeneity identified by the NMR...|$|E

40|$|Caesium- 137 (137 Cs) tracing of {{sediment}} movement depends substantially on a valid assessment of 137 Cs reference values. Recent {{research suggests that}} 137 Cs is more spatially varied than previously assumed. The range of 137 Cs values at and between reference sites, and environmental controls on 137 Cs behavior are prime topics for study. The present research investigates reference sites in the monsoonal tropics of Hong Kong. There was doubt {{about the use of}} 137 Cs in such areas, sustained by the paucity of 137 Cs studies in the Tropics and the potential lack of 137 Cs here due to global air circulation patterns. This paper shows that the technique is applicable in the Hong Kong environment. As rainfall controls 137 Cs fallout, a large range of mean annual rainfall within a small area makes Hong Kong a good location to test 137 Cs variability. Three input sites representing a wide range of rainfall totals are reported here. The uneroded status of an input site is tested by producing a profile of 137 Cs totals in 2 cm increments; the form of the profile reflecting 137 Cs movement in the soil. The results illustrate the difficulties of using a simple model of profile distribution as confirmation of a site's stability. They also confirm the difficulty of finding sites that have experienced no significant disturbance in the past four decades. Ten core samples and the <b>profile</b> <b>point</b> value were used to assess 137 Cs variability across the input sites. These data permit an evaluation of sampling methodology. The present results suggest that a large sample number is required to express the mean input value at a site.

40|$|We have {{evaluated}} the long-term chemical and physical weathering mass balance of an anomalously thick saprolite profile (> 30 in thickness) developed in granitic rocks near Curacavi, Coastal Range of central Chile. The results of geochemical mass balance calculations for the regolith <b>profile</b> <b>point</b> to a moderate depletion for Na and Sr {{due to the}} plagioclase dissolution and precipitation of kaolinite. Furthermore, silicon shows a predominantly constant behaviour along the profile that is indicative of incongruent weathering of plagioclase, strongly suggesting that quartz dissolution conditions are not reached. In addition, low depletion of K, Mg, Ca, Rb, and Ba in the saprolite indicates a low degree of K-feldspar, biotite and hornblende weathering. Denudation rates calculated using cosmogenic Be- 10 data range from 20 to 70 m/Ma. If the saprolite thickness has reached a steady-state condition, the reported denudation rates lead to mineral residence times in {{the upper part of}} the saprolite profile of about 0. 5 to 1. 8 Ma. With such duration a higher weathering degree than observed at Curacavi would be expected. This apparent contradiction might be explained if all of the weatherable plagioclase has been dissolved under the present-day precipitation and temperature conditions of the Curacavi region. Therefore, we propose that the Curacavi profile could be in local equilibrium with respect to the weatherable fraction of plagioclase. A local equilibrium regime may be reached when the overall degree of depletion is small in a weathering profile. Uniform elemental distribution and low weathering degree in the thick weathering profile at Curacavi defy the traditional notion of weathering regimes and reveal the importance of exploratory studies in order to better understand weathering process in Mediterranean and semi-arid climate regions...|$|E

To benchmark best possible scenarios for evaluation of potential Mars EDL system designs, a study is conducted to optimize the entry-to-terminal-state portion of EDL for a variety of entry velocities and vehicle masses, focusing on the identification of potential benefits of enabling angle of attack modulation. The terminal state is envisioned as one appropriate for the initiation of terminal descent via parachute or other means.

40|$|Training, Research, Isotopes, General Atomics (TRIGA) {{reactors}} {{have the}} unique capability of generating high neutron flux environments with {{the removal of}} a transient control rod, creating conditions observed in fast fission reactors. Recently, several TRIGA reactors have had issues with the deformation of fuel rods nearest the transient control rod, where the neutron flux is highest. This is a difficult problem to analyze because the damage is not simply due to rods overheating, but rather the pressurization of hydrogen, from the Uranium Hydride fuel, that has diffused into the spacing between fuel and cladding. Previous neutronic analyses utilized point kinetics; a model which assumes changes in reactivity uniformly affect the reactor's flux, resulting in no relative spatial variation over time. Point kinetics is attractive because of its low computing costs, however the pulse's localization, theoretically, should generate a pronounced flux spike and radial neutron wave, which violates an assumption of point kinetics. The {{aim of the research}} is not to explicitly describe the cause of fuel rod deformation, but rather generate time dependent, high-resolution 3 -dimensional flux maps. The Purdue Advance Reactor Core Simulator (PARCS) was used to simulate a TRIGA pulse with both nodal and point kinetics. Assuming our nodal kinetics models accurately simulate TRIGA pulses, we find that point kinetics methods are ill suited to simulate TRIGA pulses.

30|$|Certain NP {{are prone}} to dissolution, i.e. the release of ions from the NP surface, during their entire (aquatic) life cycle (Figs.Â  2, 3) [140]. In such cases, {{researchers}} were interested in uncovering the relevance but also the mechanism of toxicity induced by those ions released from NP. Against this background, Ag NP have frequently been assessed, suggesting that Ag ions released from these NP explained {{a large proportion of}} the observed toxicity for various test organisms [e.g. 141 â 143] and soil microbial communities [144]. Additionally, the mechanisms of toxicity, for example, for snails [143] and periphyton [141], were largely comparable between Ag ions and Ag NP. These observations contradict other findings, highlighting more severe implications by Ag NP than what could be explained exclusively by the Ag ions measured [145]. Differences in gene expression and transcriptomic <b>profile</b> <b>point</b> towards distinct mechanisms of toxicity in aquatic [146, 147] and terrestrial organisms [148]. Nonetheless and in line with the extensive literature review by VÃ¶lker et al. [149] it may be suggested that Ag NP and Ag ions share common mechanisms of action. This conclusion also implies that the Ag NP-induced toxicity, which largely depends on the particle surface properties, diameter, and exposure time [150], can mainly be explained by the quantity of released ions [sensu 151, 152]. Ag NP are, moreover, sulfidized (see above, Fig.Â  2 b) in wastewater treatment plants and trapped in sewage sludge. As a consequence of the usage of sewage sludge as fertilizer for crop production in various countries, soil organisms are directly exposed to Ag 2 S NP, Ag NP, and Ag+ ions. The form of Ag directly influences the location and speciation (metallic, ionic, thiol, NP) in which Ag is stored in wheat roots [153]. In cucumber and wheat, Ag 2 S NP remained in their NP form and were translocated from the roots to leaf tissue, reducing plant growth and activating plant defence mechanisms [154]. Internalization (Fig.Â  3 c) or physical adherence, such as biological surface coating (inhibiting, e.g. photosynthesis, nutrient uptake or movement) are also considered as possible mechanisms of toxicity for âinertâ NP, i.e. those not releasing toxic ions (Fig.Â  3 d) [155, 156].|$|E
