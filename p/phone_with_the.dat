5|$|Meanwhile in Scranton, {{the office}} is left without a {{receptionist}}. Not wanting to get roped into being receptionist again, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) defies Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) orders to answer the <b>phone.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> {{rest of the staff}} similarly declining to answer the phone, Andy is left with no choice but to take on the receptionist's role himself, and performs the job with unexpected gusto. He orders new magazines for the waiting area, cooks mini-pizzas as reception snacks, color-coordinates the desk, and brings in a mail cart to deliver mail. Pam and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) attempt {{to talk him out of}} his newfound enjoyment, believing it to be linked to his lingering feelings for Erin, to no success.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Harry {{returns home}} {{where his father}} Norman tells him to take {{responsibility}} and study by himself. Norman then goes to meet with Hammerhead, revealing that he helped them steal the suit from Tri-Corp as they are his company's competitor. He talks over speaker <b>phone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Big Man, who wants him to create new supervillains in return for funding. At his house, Peter sends his photos to the Bugle and tries to give Aunt May the money, but she insists that he uses 10% of every paycheck to save for a new camera.|$|E
5|$|The {{employees}} pursue Michael, and {{he confesses}} that {{he created the}} rumors to conceal the one true rumor. Andy fears {{that it might be}} the one about him. The employees urge Michael to tell them which one is true, but just as Michael is about to give in, Jim announces that Pam is actually pregnant to save Stanley. Michael denies it, but Pam shows her baby's ultrasound picture to prove it. Later, while Michael discusses her pregnancy with Jim and Pam in his office, Stanley's wife Teri returns Michael's call from earlier. He picks up the <b>phone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> intention of making an excuse for his earlier call so as to not tip her off, but he accidentally calls her Cynthia twice before Jim hangs up the phone for him. Teri had already been suspicious of Stanley and Cynthia, so Michael calling her Cynthia is enough for her to figure out what is going on. Michael, feeling guilty, watches from his office window as Stanley attacks Michael's car with a tire iron in a fit of rage. At the end of the episode, the three interns discuss what they have learned at Dunder Mifflin, which they essentially reveal was nothing.|$|E

500|$|LocoRoco was {{envisioned by}} Tsutomu Kouno, who had {{previously}} work on development of Ico. While on a train during {{the second quarter of}} 2004, Kouno had used a PDA to sketch a game that would involve multiple similar characters that would not be in direct control of the player. He realized the planet-tilting aspect after seeing how rotating the <b>phone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sketch around would lead to a compelling game. At that time, the PlayStation Portable was nearing release, and Kouno felt the unit's shoulder buttons would be appropriate for the tilting controls. Kouno also opted to develop for the PSP to break the mold of other, more complicated sequels from PlayStation 2 games that were being developed for the unit and instead create something that [...] "really seemed at home on the PSP". Kouno also wanted [...] "every aspect of the game [...] to be unique", and led to his choices for graphics and music in the game.|$|E

2500|$|During recording, {{the band}} used a sampler {{for the first}} time and hired many {{different}} musical instruments. The group experimented with electronic sounds and wrote several of the album's tracks in the studio, allowing [...] "the music to dictate itself". The song [...] "Wherever I Lay My Phone (That's My Home)" [...] was written around the ringtone of a mobile <b>phone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rhythm track being based on a sample of bassist Guto Pryce tripping over a lead while Huw Bunford played a note on his guitar. [...] "Some Things Come from Nothing" [...] came from an acid house tune written by keyboardist Cian Ciaran. Samples of Rhys playing an out-of-tune acoustic guitar and Ciaran playing drums were mixed together and the song was [...] "written and recorded simultaneously" [...] by the group. [...] "The Sound of Life Today" [...] is a 22-second sample of [...] "Some Things Come From Nothing" [...] played backwards. According to Rhys the band gave the track a [...] "really pompous title" [...] so that listeners would expect to hear the meaning of life and instead get just a [...] "collection of noises". [...] "Do or Die", [...] "Fire in My Heart" [...] and [...] "Keep the Cosmic Trigger Happy" [...] were written by Rhys while [...] "The Door to This House Remains Open" [...] developed from a band jam of the Rod Stewart song [...] "Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?" [...] which completely changed over the 30 minutes the group played for. The melody for [...] "Northern Lites" [...] was written by Gruff Rhys several years before the track was released. Reggae and rock styles were tried by the band before they settled on calypso after Rhys wrote lyrics for the song and tried playing along to a preset calypso rhythm track which was on his keyboard. The band added steel drums to the track on the spur of the moment after seeing the instruments [...] "lying around" [...] Real World during recording. The steel drums parts were performed by keyboard player Ciaran, despite the fact he did not know how to play them.|$|E
