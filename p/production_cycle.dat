5|$|Ultima Underworld II began {{production}} in April 1992, {{shortly after the}} completion of Ultima Underworld; and it was developed in nine months. The team sought to improve upon the foundation laid by the game's predecessor, particularly by increasing the size and interactivity of the game world. The team reused and improved the first game's engine. Development was impeded by insufficient staffing and extensive playtesting, and the rapid <b>production</b> <b>cycle</b> led to burnout on the team.|$|E

The game was designed to relaunch the franchise for the seventh generation of video game consoles, and the team was initially led by Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka, but Naka resigned to form his own company, Prope. The team then split {{to work on the}} Wii game Sonic and the Secret Rings (2007). The game was rushed to market in time for the holiday season; versions for the Wii and Microsoft Windows were cancelled. The game is often referred to with colloquial terms that reference its year of release, such as Sonic '06.|$|E

With a <b>production</b> <b>cycle</b> longer than two years, the graphics were not merely upscaled to higher resolutions and feature updated models and textures. Kitase commented {{that he wanted}} to excite new and returning players and added more depth to do so and opened up the possibility of further remasters based on reception. Many views could not simply be reframed to 16:9 because that would reveal characters waiting for their cues off-screen, so the remastering team performed a lot of redrawing and additions to the visuals.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the original Mass Effect trilogy, which was spearheaded by BioWare's Edmonton studio, Mass Effect: Andromeda was handled by a new team out of Montreal. The game experienced a troubled <b>production</b> <b>cycle</b> that saw many members of its leadership team depart mid-project and numerous changes in creative vision. It was built using the Frostbite 3 engine, which required that BioWare construct all systems, tools, and assets from scratch as the series was previously built on another engine. Following the game's release, BioWare released several patches in response to critical feedback, but decided not to release further single-player downloadable content additions.|$|E

25|$|Proper {{reproduction}} of colors, especially in professional environments, requires color management {{of all the}} devices involved in the production process, many of them using RGB. Color management results in several transparent conversions between device-independent and device-dependent color spaces (RGB and others, as CMYK for color printing) during a typical <b>production</b> <b>cycle,</b> {{in order to ensure}} color consistency throughout the process. Along with the creative processing, such interventions on digital images can damage the color accuracy and image detail, especially where the gamut is reduced. Professional digital devices and software tools allow for 48 bpp (bits per pixel) images to be manipulated (16 bits per channel), to minimize any such damage.|$|E
25|$|The 1953 {{model year}} {{was not only}} the Corvette's first {{production}} year, but at 300 produced it was also the lowest-volume Corvette.

All 1953 models had Polo White exteriors, red interiors, and black canvas soft tops. Order guides showed heaters and AM radios as optional, but all 1953 models were equipped with both. Over two hundred 1953 Corvettes are known to exist today. They had independent front suspension, but featured a rigid axle supported by longitudinal leaf springs at the rear. The cost of the first production model Corvettes in 1953 was $3490.|$|E
25|$|Mass Effect: Andromeda {{was built}} using EA DICE's Frostbite 3 engine, which {{required}} that BioWare construct all systems, tools, and assets from scratch as {{the series was}} previously built on Epic Games' Unreal Engine. Going into development, the company knew that the transition to Frostbite would be a difficult one, having already made the switch for Dragon Age: Inquisition, which proved to be extremely challenging as the engine was not designed with role-playing games in mind. In an effort to optimize the engine's capabilities, BioWare would sometimes enlist the help of other Frostbite developers. For example, {{to ensure that the}} game's driving mechanics handled well, BioWare invited the Need for Speed team to come onsite and offer advice and guidance. BioWare tried to push the boundaries of the software, particularly in the area of character animation, but struggled with facial animations in particular. This was due in part to struggles with various animation programs, an understaffed development team, and a delayed <b>production</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{continuing}} {{development of new}} insect-derived food products, microbial research on edible insects and insect-based foods is still very limited. The goal {{of this study was}} to increase the knowledge on the microbial quality of edible insects by comparing the bacterial community composition of mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) and crickets (Acheta domesticus and Gryllodes sigillatus) from several <b>production</b> <b>cycles</b> and rearing companies. Remarkable differences in the bacterial community composition were found between different mealworm rearing companies and mealworm <b>production</b> <b>cycles</b> from the same company. In comparison with mealworms, the bacterial community composition of the investigated crickets was more similar among different companies, and was highly similar between both cricket species investigated. Mealworm communities were dominated by Spiroplasma and Erwinia species, while crickets were abundantly colonised by (Para) bacteroides species. With respect to food safety, only a few operational taxonomic units could be associated with potential human pathogens such as Cronobacter or spoilage bacteria such as Pseudomonas. In summary, our results implicate that at least for cricket rearing, <b>production</b> <b>cycles</b> of constant and good quality in terms of bacterial composition can be obtained by different rearing companies.
