40|$|In {{the cash}} grain area farm tenure {{is one of}} the most {{important}} factors influencing the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> fanning. Crop-share tenancy means a high percentage of land in corn and usually a small number <b>of</b> livestock per <b>farm.</b> Heavy sale <b>of</b> crops off the farm tends to deplete fertility and reduce yields. The greatest differences in farm organization, however are associated with the disposition of the crops after they are raised. On the farms studied there was but little difference in the crop rotations followed as between the <b>principal</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farms,</b> though there was considerable variation within each type...|$|R

The <b>principal</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> a term is the most general type which is assignable to the term. Hirokawa gave characterisations <b>of</b> the <b>principal</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> linear terms and of beta-normal affine terms.

This paper points out that by using Berardi's pruning, the theorem on beta-normal affine terms is obtained from the theorem on linear terms. This is the first result.

30|$|Unfortunately, {{there are}} limited {{empirical}} evidences {{on this subject}} in the EU.

This allows for comparison among countries and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> supporting the idea that farm income variability is generally high and that differences among countries and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farms</b> exist: more specialised and small farms are often faced with relatively higher income variability. Agrosynergie (2011) found that variability appears on average high in specialist granivore and specialist field crops farms, while low in mixed farms.

40|$|All {{gradations}} {{in farming}} systems between cash grain production and large cattle feeding establishments {{are present in}} Cass and Otoe counties. Therefore, to facilitate {{a study of the}} various combinations, the farms are classified into <b>types.</b> Three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farms,</b> grain, general, and livestock, have been arranged with arbitrary limits so that a reasonably representative sample falls within each group. A preliminary phase of the study attempts to compare three methods <b>of</b> determining <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farms.</b> Another phase deals with the extent of grain, general, and livestock farming in this area by groups of years similar in price level and production. An analysis is made to try to identify any significant shifting in <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> between groups <b>of</b> years. The third objective is an attempt to determine what relationships exist between <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farms,</b> size <b>of</b> <b>farms,</b> and labor incomes. Finally the study includes an analysis <b>of</b> specialized <b>farms</b> within <b>types,</b> that is, those farms characterized by relatively heavy production of cattle, hogs, corn, or wheat. The source of the data consists <b>of</b> 827 <b>farm</b> account records from Cass and Otoe counties. The data cover the 12 year period from 1928 to 1939, inclusive. Advisor: N/...|$|R
