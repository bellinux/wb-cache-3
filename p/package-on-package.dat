Other features include {{front and rear}} cameras, a three-axis gyroscope, headset controls, proximity and ambient light sensors, microphone, magnetometer, accelerometer and a 9.7inch multi-touch screen with a maximum resolution of 1024×768 hence resulting in 132 ppi. The iPad 2 has four physical switches, including a home button near the display that returns the user to the home screen, and three plastic physical switches on the sides: wake/sleep, volume up/down, and a third switch for either screen rotation lock or mute. The home button on the iPad 2 is [...] "easier to double tap" [...] than the previous generation of the iPad. Apple reduced {{the size of the}} iPad by eliminating the stamped sheet metal frame from the display, integrating new thinner glass technology for the touch screen overlay, and slightly reducing the space between the display and battery. The iPad 2's screen is thinner, lighter, and yet stronger than the original iPad's. The iPad 2 also supports screen mirroring via the digital AV adapter and through AirPlay as of iOS 5.|$|E
50|$|The Samsung Galaxy S has 512 MB of LPDDR1 RAM (Mobile DDR). Some {{variants}} {{also come}} with either 8 GB or 16 GB of OneNAND memory combined in a <b>package-on-package</b> stack with the processor. An external microSD card slot supports up to 32 GB of additional storage memory.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, this {{situation}} has been exacerbated by increasingly high-speed serial inter-chip connections (interconnects or buses) on circuit boards {{as well as}} by even more complex chip packaging technologies like system-on-a-chip (SOC), system-in-package (SIP) and <b>package-on-package</b> (POP). These and other developments are making instrumentation embedded into chips a necessity for design validation, test and debug processes.|$|E

In comparison to LPDDR2, LPDDR3 offers a higher data rate, greater bandwidth and power efficiency, and higher memory density. LPDDR3 achieves a data rate of 1600 MT/s and utilizes key new technologies: write-leveling and command/address training, optional on-die termination (ODT), and low-I/O capacitance. LPDDR3 supports both <b>package-on-package</b> (PoP) and discrete packaging types.|$|E

TSVs are a high performance interconnect techniques {{used as an}} alternative to wire-bond and flip chips to create 3D packages and 3D integrated circuits. Compared to alternatives such as <b>package-on-package,</b> the density of the vias is substantially higher, and the length of the connections becomes shorter.|$|E
50|$|In March 2013, Apple {{released}} {{an updated version}} of the third generation Apple TV (AppleTV3,2) containing a smaller, single-core version of the A5 processor. Unlike the other A5 variants, this version of the A5 is not a <b>package-on-package</b> (PoP), having no stacked RAM. The chip is very small, just 6.1×6.2 mm, but as the decrease in size is not due to a decrease in feature size (it is still on a 32 nm fabrication process), this indicates that this A5 revision is of a new design. Markings tell that it's named APL7498, and in software, the chip is called S5L8947.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the A4 and A5, the A5X {{is covered}} with a metal heat {{spreader}} and is not a <b>package-on-package</b> (PoP) assembly. In those earlier chips the RAM sat on top of the SoC, however, in the A5X the RAM is not bundled together with the SoC, instead the A5X sits {{on one side of the}} motherboard and twin Samsung LP DDR2 SDRAM is soldered directly to the other side of the motherboard. The A5X is manufactured on a 45 nm process by Samsung. The silicon die size has increased drastically compared to the A5 at 165 mm2, 3.1 times larger than the 53.3 mm2 die area of the original A4.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the functionality of electronic devices, while reducing the overall size and weight of the electronic chip packages, electronic chip packages can be combined into a 3 D assembly. In this field we present a technology for stacking of multiple chip packages, {{resulting in a total}} volume almost equal to that of a single bare die. The technology is based on batch-processed ultra-thin chip packages (UTCPs) with a fine pitch metal fan-out. <b>Package-on-package</b> (PoP) technology enables stacking of UTCPs by vacuum lamination, followed by through hole interconnection technology for making contacts to the metal fan-out of the embedded UTCPs within the stack. The individual chip packages can be tested before stacking...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{ever-increasing}} {{demands of}} higher perfor-mance, multiple functions, higher density, and lower cost man-date {{the reduction of}} the I/O pitch on the die {{as well as on the}} package. Pitch specifications of current substrate technologies do not match the stringent fine-pitch I/O requirements. Combin-ing embedded wafer-level package (EMWLP) and <b>package-on-package</b> (PoP) technologies yields a preferred solution providing fan-out area to route the fine-pitch I/Os of the chip to large-pitch I/Os on to the extra area of fan-out EMWLP packages and allows the use of conventional substrate technology. However, there are many challenges to realizing the PoP of EMWLP packages. They include the die shift during the reconstruction process, double-sided reroute distribution line (RDL), and through-mold via (TMV) connections on a thin bottom package. The assembly of EMWLP and PoP, thermal management of PoP packages, an...|$|E
40|$|Ball {{grid array}} (BGA) {{packages}} having 0. 5 mm ball pitch require {{careful attention to}} printed circuit board (PCB) design parameters to successfully yield reliable and robust assemblies. PCBs with <b>package-on-package</b> (PoP) technology have additional assembly requirements and options {{that need to be}} considered when designing the PCB. Fine-pitch PCB design is a team effort and may require more than a common list of design rules. Close coordination and communication between component supplier, PCB designer, PCB fabricator, and PCB assembly vendor is mandatory. The following factors have a major effect on the quality and reliability of PCB assembly: pad design, via-in-pad (VIP) guidelines, via finishing, stencil design, solder paste requirements, solder paste deposition, and reflow profile. This application report provides a starting point for estblishing a set of design guidelines. It is strongly recommended that you perform actual studies in conjunction with you...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe thermally-induced {{deformations}} of <b>Package-On-Package</b> (POP) are investigated theoretically, numerically and experimentally in this paper. An {{analytical model}} of POP is newly proposed for prediction of the warpage of POP, {{which can be}} achieved by solving a few linear multiple polynomial equations rather than building a complex model in ANSYS, and leads to satisfying results. All the parameters needed for the analytical model are temperature-dependant material properties, and geometrical parameters. Measurements of the the warpage of POP under various temperature loads are made with a Profilometer Altisurf 500. Moreover, a 3 -D linear finite element model was built. Both measurements and simulation validate our analytical model. The results from the experiments are presented and compared in detail with those from the 3 -D linear finite element and theoretical analysis. The good agreements in the experimental and modelling results reveal the validation of 3 -D linear finite element model in mechanics sense and the effectiveness of the numerical and theoretical models in physics predictions. The interest lies in a very easy use of this theoretical model to quickly obtain the warpage information for deciding whether the design is suitable and/or comparing the different POP circuits design...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, with {{increasing}} demand for high-density assembly in mobile electronics products, a <b>package-on-package</b> (PoP) structure has been standardized. The demand for lowering the PoP profile is getting stronger as consumers demand thinner mobile devices. To assemble {{a low profile}} PoP and mount it on a mother board, {{it is necessary to}} have a precise warpage control of PoP components, including its bottom package. It is expected that a flip-chip chip-scale-package (FCCSP) with thin mold cap will be used as the bottom package of the PoP in the next 2 - 3 years. In order to control the package warpage, it is necessary to optimize a large number of parameters related to the package substrate, silicon die and mold compound. Among them, equivalent coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the package substrate {{is one of the most}} important factors. In this paper, control of the package warpage was studied by focusing on the glass-cloth content ratio in the package substrate. Glass-cloth has the lowest CTE among the constituent materials of the substrate, so it contributes to reduce the equivalent CTE of the substrate. To maximize the glass-cloth content, a substrate with a thick core and thin build-up structure was prepared, and the package with thin mold cap was subsequently formed. Compared with a similar package with a conventional substrate structure, its warpage, measured experimentally, was about 20 % smaller. Consequently, it was concluded that the glass-cloth content ratio is a key factor to control package warpage behavior in the PoP assembly process...|$|E
