25|$|David Anthony has praised Gimbutas's {{insights}} {{regarding the}} Indo-European Urheimat, but also disputed Gimbutas's assertion {{that there was}} a widespread <b>peaceful</b> <b>society</b> before the Kurgan incursion, noting that Europe had hillforts and weapons, and presumably warfare, long before the Kurgan. A standard textbook of European prehistory corroborates this point, stating that warfare existed in neolithic Europe and that adult males were given preferential treatment in burial rites.|$|E
25|$|This poem {{is a clear}} {{description}} of Martí’s societal hopes for his homeland. Within the poem, he talks about how regardless of the person, whether kind or cruel he cultivates a white rose, meaning that he remains peaceful. This coincides with his ideology about establishing unity amongst the people, more so those of Cuba, through a common identity, with no regards to ethnic and racial differences. This doctrine could be accomplished if one treated his enemy with peace as he would treat a friend. The kindness of one person should be shared with all people, regardless of personal conflict. By following the moral that lies within “Cultivo Rosa Blanca”, Martí’s vision of Cuban solidarity could be possible, creating a more <b>peaceful</b> <b>society</b> that would emanate through future generations.|$|E

25|$|International groups {{attempted}} {{to pressure the}} IOC to reject Beijing's bid in protest {{of the state of}} human rights in the People's Republic of China. One Chinese dissident who expressed similar sentiments was arrested and sentenced to two years in prison for calling on the IOC to do just {{that at the same time}} that IOC inspectors were touring the city. Amnesty International expressed concern in 2006 regarding the Olympic Games to be held in China in 2008, likewise expressing concerns over the human rights situation. The second principle in the Fundamental Principles of Olympism, Olympic Charter states that The goal of Olympism is to place sport at the service of the harmonious development of man, with a view to promoting a <b>peaceful</b> <b>society</b> concerned with the preservation of human dignity. Amnesty International considers the policies and practices of the People's Republic as failing to meet that principle, and urged the IOC to press China to immediately enact human rights reform.|$|E
500|$|A large {{version of}} the famous {{photograph}} of Hines was accorded a prominent position in the Australian War Memorial's permanent building in Canberra after it opened in 1941. The photo was {{also included in the}} 2014 redevelopment of the Memorial's permanent World War I exhibition. In a short biography of Hines published in 2002, historian Peter Stanley commented that [...] "'Wild Eye's' bravado conceals a deeper pathos" [...] and he [...] "was a man whose skills in fighting were needed and whose knack for souveniring was admired, but he had few gifts that a <b>peaceful</b> <b>society</b> valued".|$|E
500|$|Minh and {{his closest}} {{supporters}} tended to view regard Huynh Tan Phat, Nguyen Huu Tho {{and the other}} nominal NLF leaders as [...] "former bourgeois colleagues" [...] and moderate, nationalist non-communists who were uncomfortable with a foreign presence in South Vietnam, and whose political views had remained largely unchanged since their departure for the jungle a few years before. Minh's group thus believed that the NLF could be peacefully reintegrated into mainstream politics. After his overthrow, Tho said that his administration wanted {{to win over the}} religious sects and the Cambodian minority in the Mekong Delta who had felt alienated by Diệm, as according to him, avowed communists were a weak minority in the NLF. This would then make the communists irrelevant in a free electoral process in a normal <b>peaceful</b> <b>society</b> with a pro-western foreign policy that was not hardline anti-communist. According to Tho, this plan was not a deal with communists or the NLF as his group saw it as a political attempt to coax back non-communist dissidents and isolate those that were communists. Minh and Don also later described similar plans and said that they believed the Americans had become aware of this and grown hostile to them.|$|E
50|$|Mangyans {{lived in}} <b>peaceful</b> <b>societies</b> as {{compared}} to the head hunting tribes of North Luzon and the brave defiant warrior tribes of the South. Social scientists theorized that some <b>societies</b> become <b>peaceful</b> because their system of norms and values reward peaceful behavior but disapprove aggressive and impulsive behaviors. <b>Peaceful</b> <b>societies</b> are characterized by egalitarian social organization without status competition between men and without asymmetric relationship between men and women. Another theory posited that populations adapt, therefore, offering a more logical explanation why Mangyans preferred to retreat in the hinterlands. They accept peaceful submissiveness when they encounter lowland settlers, missionaries, traders and government officials.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an exploratory {{look at how}} the leadership practices of business organizations may foster more <b>peaceful</b> <b>societies.</b> I develop the logic for positive relationships between participative organizational leadership, employee empowerment, and peace. I offer several mechanisms to explain why these different manifestations of voice are likely to contribute to <b>peaceful</b> <b>societies.</b> I then draw on several cross-national databases to provide a preliminary examination of the hypotheses. I find support for the hypotheses regarding the positive effects of participative leadership and employee empowerment in work organizations on peace. The paper concludes by discussing contributions of this research to the organizational studies literature and offers directions for future research. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
500|$|The {{concept of}} a {{peaceful}} community of nations had been proposed {{as far back as}} 1795, when Immanuel Kant's [...] outlined the idea of a league of nations to control conflict and promote peace between states. Kant argued {{for the establishment of a}} peaceful world community, not in a sense of a global government, but in the hope that each state would declare itself a free state that respects its citizens and welcomes foreign visitors as fellow rational beings, thus promoting <b>peaceful</b> <b>society</b> worldwide. International co-operation to promote collective security originated in the Concert of Europe that developed after the Napoleonic Wars in the 19th century in an attempt to maintain the status quo between European states and so avoid war. [...] This period also saw the development of international law, with the first Geneva Conventions establishing laws dealing with humanitarian relief during wartime, and the international Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 governing rules of war and the peaceful settlement of international disputes. As historians William H. Harbaugh and Ronald E. Powaski point out, Theodore Roosevelt was the first American President to call for an international league. [...] At the acceptance for his Nobel Prize, Roosevelt said: [...] "it would be a masterstroke if those great powers honestly bent on peace would form a League of Peace" ...|$|E
2500|$|Te Ua {{began to}} {{formulate}} his new religion, {{complete with a}} holy book, Ua Rongo Pai (the Gospel according to Ua) which combined elements of Old Testament morality, Christian doctrine and traditional Māori religion. Its goal {{was to create a}} <b>peaceful</b> <b>society</b> in which righteousness and justice prevailed. They believed they were a second Chosen People and that, with divine aid, they would regain control of their hereditary land when the Creator, Jehovah, fought for them and drove the English into the sea. To help him propagate the religion, Te Ua chose three men [...] Tahutaki, Hepenaia and Wi Parara.|$|E
2500|$|The plants {{cultivated}} by the Māori arrivals were ill-suited for the colder Chathams, so the Moriori {{lived as}} hunter-gatherers and fishermen. While their new environment deprived {{them of the}} resources with which to build ocean-going craft for long voyages, the Moriori invented what {{was known as the}} waka korari, a semi-submerged craft, constructed of flax and lined with air bladders from kelp. This craft was used to travel to the outer islands on 'birding' missions. The Moriori society was a <b>peaceful</b> <b>society</b> and bloodshed was outlawed by the chief Nunuku after generations of warfare. Arguments were solved by consensus or by duels rather than warfare, but {{at the first sign of}} bloodshed, the [...] fight was over.|$|E
5000|$|The {{creation}} of <b>peaceful</b> <b>societies</b> encompasses {{a range of}} issues that must be addressed simultaneously. These include conflict prevention, mediation, cease-fire negotiations, the delivery of humanitarian aid, post-war reconstruction, and the establishment of strong civil societies.

2500|$|To {{help promote}} Satyricon in the United States, Fellini flew to Los Angeles in January 1970 for {{interviews}} with Dick Cavett and David Frost. He {{also met with}} film director Paul Mazursky who wanted to star him alongside Donald Sutherland in his new film, Alex in Wonderland. In February, Fellini scouted locations in Paris for The Clowns, a docufiction both for cinema and television, based on his childhood memories of the circus and a [...] "coherent theory of clowning." [...] As he saw it, the clown [...] "was always the caricature of a well-established, ordered, <b>peaceful</b> <b>society.</b> But today all is temporary, disordered, grotesque. Who can still laugh at clowns?... All the world plays a clown now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also {{of primary}} {{significance}} {{is the notion}} that just means are the most likely to lead to just ends. When Gandhi said that [...] "the means may be likened to the seed, the end to a tree," [...] he expressed the philosophical kernel of what some refer to as prefigurative politics. Martin Luther King, a student of Gandhian nonviolent resistance, concurred with this tenet, concluding that [...] "nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek." [...] Proponents of nonviolence reason that the actions taken in the present inevitably re-shape the social order in like form. They would argue, for instance, that it is fundamentally irrational to use violence to achieve a <b>peaceful</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The World Taekwondo Federation also {{refers to}} the commandments of the Hwarang in the {{articulation}} of its taekwondo philosophy. [...] Like the ITF philosophy, it centers {{on the development of}} a <b>peaceful</b> <b>society</b> as one of the overarching goals for the practice of taekwondo. The WT's stated philosophy is that this goal can be furthered by adoption of the Hwarang spirit, by behaving rationally ("education in accordance with the reason of heaven"), and by recognition of the philosophies embodied in the taegeuk (the yin and the yang, i.e., [...] "the unity of opposites") and the sam taegeuk (understanding change in the world as the interactions of the heavens, the Earth, and Man). The philosophical position articulated by the Kukkiwon is likewise based on the Hwarang tradition.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} has focused on business as a mediating institution that can influence society while engaging in the traditional profit-making and value generation functions. This work includes Professors Fort’s and Schipani’s arguments about how business may be able {{to play a role in}} promoting more <b>peaceful</b> <b>societies,</b> and the work of other scholars addressing how businesses might serve a role in reducing violence in society and the workplace. Although there is a significant body of scholarship on the role of business in reducing violence in society, there is little research on concrete steps for businesses to take to achieve this goal. This paper attempts to begin to fill that void. As identified by Fort and Schipani, business may promote more <b>peaceful</b> <b>societies</b> by encouraging a sense of community and by engaging in track two diplomacy. We argue that one way in which to encourage a sense of community and engage in track two diplomacy on a small scale, and therefore potentially play a role in reducing violence, is for business to provide what we denote as complementary alternative benefits (CABs), to its workforce. In this paper, we encourage businesses to offer CABs which focus on sustaining the health, reducing the stress, and improving the camaraderie of its workforce. We argue that business can use these benefits to promote a healthy, less-stressed, and collegial workforce that is less prone to resolve conflicts by violence. Further, we examine the role business plays in promoting more <b>peaceful</b> <b>societies</b> and how employer-initiated stress reduction programs are consistent with both business ethics and peace-building principles. We suggest that the employment benefits firms provide to their workforces may have a significant impact on how those employees interact with society. Finally, we demonstrate how CABs may also reduce costs related to absenteeism and turnover and thus improve the bottom line...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MA (Political Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2008. This thesis {{contributes}} to existing literature on violent and <b>peaceful</b> <b>societies</b> generally, {{and more specifically}} {{contributes to}} debates on gender egalitarian societies within the fields of Peace, Gender and Indigenous Studies, {{by focusing on the}} KhoeSan, and KhoeSan women especially. This research project focused on two critically intersectional components: (1) reconstructing knowledge in general and reclaiming indigenous knowledge, from an African feminist perspective; and (2) analysing and reclaiming <b>peaceful</b> <b>societies</b> and the notion of nonviolence as a norm. Inextricably tied to these primary research questions, is the issue of gender, and gender egalitarianism, especially as it relates to women. An interdisciplinary, intersectional approach was used, combining the analytical lenses of the fields of Political Science (Peace Studies), Anthropology and Gender Studies, with some attention to cultures and spiritualities. The participatory methods employed include focus group discussions and unstructured interviews with KhoeSan community leaders, especially women elders. Concrete skills exchange with, and support for, the participating communities was consciously facilitated. Scholarship on, as well as practices of, the Khoesan evince normative nonviolence, as well as gender egalitarianism. These ancient norms and practices are still evident in modern KhoeSan oral history and practice. This thesis sets the following precedents, particularly through the standpoint of a female KhoeSan scholar: (a) contributing to the research on <b>peaceful</b> <b>societies</b> by offering an analysis of the KhoeSan’s nonviolence as a norm; (b) and extending scholarship on gender egalitarian societies to the KhoeSan. Further research in these intersecting areas would be invaluable, especially of peacefulness, social egalitarianism and collective leadership, as well as gender egalitarianism, among the KhoeSan. Broadening research to encompass Southern Africa as a region would significantly aid documentation...|$|R

2500|$|Following {{this section}} is the Words of Mormon. This small book, {{said to be}} written in AD 385 by Mormon, is a short {{introduction}} to the books of Mosiah, Alma, Helaman, Third Nephi, and Fourth Nephi. These books are described as being abridged from a large quantity of existing records called [...] "the large plates of Nephi" [...] that detailed the people's history {{from the time of}} Omni to Mormon's own life. The Book of Third Nephi is of particular importance within the Book of Mormon because it contains an account of a visit by Jesus from heaven to the Americas sometime after his resurrection and ascension. The text says that during this American visit, he repeated much of the same doctrine and instruction given in the Gospels of the Bible and he established an enlightened, <b>peaceful</b> <b>society</b> which endured for several generations, but which eventually broke into warring factions again.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, Kabul {{was known}} as the Paris of central Asia as it was {{transforming}} into a European style city.

The inhabitants of Kabul known as [...] "Kabulis" [...] were highly educated, modern, progressive and cosmopolitan people. Where women and men attended primary school, high school and university. Mini-jupes (mini skirts) were a common sight in the 1970s.
