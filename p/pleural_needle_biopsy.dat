40|$|AbstractObjective: Pleural fluid {{parameters}} that {{predict a}} diagnostic closed <b>pleural</b> <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> were investigated. Design: A retrospective analysis. Setting: The Institute of Pulmonology, Hadassah University Hospital. Patients and methods: Forty-four patients who underwent closed pleural needle biopsies {{were included in}} this study. Pleural fluid values of protein, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pH, and {{white blood cell count}} with differential cell counts, from patients with diagnostic and non-diagnostic pleural biopsies were compared. Results: Thirteen patients (29 %) had diagnostic biopsies. Malignancy was identified in 10 patients (23 %), of whom 70 % had adenocarcinoma. Three other patients had non-malignant specific diagnosis. LDH levels in pleural fluid from patients with diagnostic pleural biopsy were higher than in patients with non-diagnostic pleural biopsies (1436 ± 333 U l− 1 vs. 775 ± 109 U l− 1; P< 0. 05). LDH levels less than 510 U l− 1 were highly predictive of a negative biopsy (negative predictive value of 86. 6 %). Follow up revealed malignancy including mesothelioma and lymphoma, in 10 of 30 (33 %) patients with non-diagnostic biopsies, and one patient died of unrelated cause, while the pleural effusion either resolved, remained stable or an alternative benign process was identified in 19 patients (63 %). Conclusions: Low levels of LDH (< 510 U l− 1) were highly predictive of a negative <b>pleural</b> <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy.</b> Thus, LDH may serve as a useful guide in deciding whether to perform closed pleural biopsy or to proceed to thoracoscopically guided biopsy...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundSeveral {{studies have}} already {{addressed}} the potential {{role of an}} increased fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18 F FDG) uptake in identification of pleural malignancy. In this pilot study, we investigate the role of 18 F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for differentiating asbestos-related benign pleural disease from malignant mesothelioma. Materials and MethodsThe study population comprised 31 consecutive patients (17 malignant mesotheliomas, nine benign asbestos pleurisies, and five diffuse pleural fibrosis) {{with a mean age}} of 61 years between January 2006 and December 2008. Thoracoscopy or image-guided <b>pleural</b> <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> were systematically performed to reveal pathologic diagnosis and/or clinical follow-up for at least 3 years for presence or absence of malignant pleural effusion. ROCs analyses for standardized uptake value (SUV) adjusted to body weight were calculated between benign and malignant pleural diseases. Results 18 F-FDG PET/CT imaging correctly detected the presence of malignancies in 15 of 17 patients with malignant mesothelioma for sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of 88. 2 %, 92. 9 %, and 90. 3 %, respectively. 18 F-FDG PET/CT imaging correctly identified 13 of 14 cases of benign pleural disease. The mean SUV values were 6. 5 ± 3. 4 for malignant mesothelioma cases and 0. 8 ± 0. 6 for benign pleural diseases (p < 0. 001). When we compared the two groups of pleural disease, a cut-off value of 2. 2 for SUV gave the best accuracy with 94. 1 %, 100 %, 100 %, and 93. 3 % for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, respectively. ConclusionPreliminary results of this trial provide evidence that 18 F-FDG PET/CT imaging is a highly accurate and reliable noninvasive test to decide for further investigation of differentiating malignant mesothelioma from benign pleural disease...|$|E
40|$|Background: Tuberculous pleuritis {{remains the}} commonest cause of exudative effusions {{in areas with}} a high {{prevalence}} of tuberculosis and histological and/or microbiological confirmation on pleural tissue is {{the gold standard for}} its diagnosis. Uncertainty remains regarding the choice of closed <b>pleural</b> <b>biopsy</b> <b>needles.</b> Objectives: This prospective study compared ultrasound-assisted Abrams and Tru-Cut <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> with regard to their diagnostic yield for pleural tuberculosis. Methods: 89 patients (54 men) of mean±SD age 38. 7 ± 16. 7 years with pleural effusions and a clinical suspicion of tuberculosis were enrolled in the study. Transthoracic ultrasound was performed on all patients, who were then randomly assigned to undergo ≥ 4 Abrams <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> followed by ≥ 4 Tru-Cut <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> or vice versa. Medical thoracoscopy was performed on cases with non-diagnostic closed biopsies. Histological and/or microbiological proof of tuberculosis on any pleural specimen was considered the gold standard for pleural tuberculosis. Results: Pleural tuberculosis was diagnosed in 66 patients, alternative diagnoses were established in 20 patients and 3 remained undiagnosed. Pleural biopsy specimens obtained with Abrams <b>needles</b> contained <b>pleural</b> tissue in 81 patients (91. 0 %) and were diagnostic for tuberculosis in 54 patients (sensitivity 81. 8 %), whereas Tru-Cut <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens only contained pleural tissue in 70 patients (78. 7 %, p= 0. 015) and were diagnostic in 43 patients (sensitivity 65. 2 %, p= 0. 022).

40|$|Transthoracic {{ultrasound}} (US) {{has become}} an important diagnostic tool in modern chest medicine. The range of thoracic lesions for which transthoracic US may yield useful diagnostic information has expanded to include not only chest wall and pleural lesions, but also peripheral lung nodules, pulmonary consolidations, necrotizing pneumonias and lung abscesses, tumors with obstructive pneumonitis, mediastinal masses, and peridiaphragmatic lesions. A variety of ultrasound features and signs of chest diseases have been well characterized and widely applied in clinical practice.

40|$|Introduction: When {{cytology}} for pleural fluid is nondiagnostic, thoracoscopy or cutting-needle pleural biopsy {{or closed}} percutaneous <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> using Abrams <b>needle</b> (ANPB) {{can be used}} to obtain tissue samples. Ultrasound guidance for biopsies performed with an Abrams needle {{can be used to}} increase the diagnostic yield of this traditional method. Aim of the study: This study aimed to compare the diagnostic validity of ANPB under ultrasound guidance (US-ANPB) with that of medical thoracoscopy in patients with pleural effusion. Methods: 30 patients with recurrent exudative pleural effusion of undetermined etiology that have undergone cytologic analysis and could not be diagnosed were included in the study and divided into 2 groups, Group I who underwent medical thoracoscopy for diagnosis (n =  15) and Group II who underwent ultrasound-guided Abrams <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> for diagnosis (n =  15). Comparison between the two groups was drawn in terms of diagnostic sensitivity and complications associated with the methods used. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic thoracoscopy in group I was 100 % & 100 % respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound-guided Abrams needle in group II was 100 % & 100 % respectively. No difference was identified between the sensitivities of the two methods. Complications of both groups were of low rate and tolerable. Conclusion: If US guidance can be used for biopsies performed with an Abrams needle, the yield of this traditional method can be increased. The use of US-guided Abram’s <b>needle</b> <b>pleural</b> <b>biopsy</b> is simple, safe and well tolerated...|$|R
40|$|Minimally {{invasive}} investigations, such as pleural fluid cytological {{assessment and}} closed percutaneous pleural biopsy, are often performed {{first in the}} investigation of suspected malignant pleural effusions. Malignant pleural effusions can be diagnosed with pleural fluid cytology alone in most cases; however, closed pleural biopsy is performed to increase the diagnostic yield when pleural fluid cytology is negative. This additional yield is at the expense of increased complication rates. We report a 64 -year old man with a negative pleural fluid cytology but suspected malignant pleural effusion who underwent a closed pleural biopsy, which was complicated by pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and severe subcutaneous emphysema.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pleural {{diseases}} {{are a common}} and increasing clinical problem. Establishing accurate diagnosis is an essential step in management of these patients, and approximately 40 % of pleural effusions will remain undiagnosed after initial diagnostic thoracocentesis. Obtaining pleural tissue (by blind, image-guided or thoracoscopic pleural biopsy) is therefore a key procedure. Recent evidence provides important information on the relative value {{of each of these}} techniques. RECENT FINDINGS: For the diagnosis of malignant pleural disease, both thoracoscopic and image-guided biopsy have a far higher diagnostic yield than blind <b>pleural</b> <b>biopsy.</b> Cutting <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> have a higher diagnostic yield in malignancy (and especially mesothelioma) compared with fine needle aspiration. The complication rate of image-guided biopsy is low. Rates of biopsy site tract invasion by mesothelioma may be lower using smaller biopsy ports, as used for image-guided pleural biopsy. SUMMARY: Blind pleural biopsy should no longer be conducted for the study of malignant pleural disease if facilities for other techniques are available. Image-guided and thoracoscopic biopsies have similarly high diagnostic rates, and are complementary techniques used in different clinical situations. Further studies assessing biopsy tract site invasion from mesothelioma with different biopsy techniques are required...|$|R
40|$|Background: Sometimes {{etiological}} {{diagnosis of}} pleural effusion is difficult despite cytological, biochemical and microbiological tests and labeled as undiagnosed exudative pleural effusions. Aim of {{present study was}} to make an etiological diagnosis of pleural effusion. Materials and Methods: Study group included patients of exudative pleural effusion where etiological diagnosis could not be yielded by conventional cytological, biochemical and microbiological investigations. Pleural tissue was obtained by Cope′s <b>pleural</b> <b>biopsy</b> <b>needle</b> and or thoracoscopy. Pleural biopsy was subjected to histopathology, ZN staining and culture to find the mycobacterium tuberculosis. Results: Out of 25 patients, 17 (68 %) and 8 (32 %) were male and female, respectively. Age ranged from 15 to 65 years (mean 31. 72). Mean value of serum and pleural fluid LDH was 170. 56 U/L and 1080. 28 U/L, respectively. Histopathology of 9 (36 %) showed epitheloid granuloma with caseation necrosis. In other 9 (36 %) patients, epitheloid granulomas (with or without giant cells) was reported. In 5 (20 %) patients, histopathology report was of nonspecific chronic inflammation. Histopathology was reported as normal in one case; {{it turned out to be}} a case of malignancy. In two (8 %) patients, pleural tissue obtained was inadequate for opinions; however, other tests revealed malignancy in one and tuberculosis in other. Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain was positive for AFB in two patients and culture of pleural tissue showed presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in three patients. Conclusions: The role of percutaneous closed <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> of pleura among patients of undiagnosed exudative pleural effusion is still accepted as a diagnostic tool, as this may lead to a specific diagnosis among 76 % of cases. This is of particular importance in a developing country like India where the facilities of thoracoscopy and imaging guided cutting <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> are not easily available...|$|R

We sought to study the use of <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> and open surgical biopsy in women with breast cancer, predictors of <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> use, and the effect of biopsy choice on overall number of surgical procedures needed to treat breast cancer. METHODS: We analyzed Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) -Medicare data for 45, 542 women diagnosed between 1991 and 1999 with ductal carcinoma in situ and stage I-II breast cancer. By using diagnosis and procedure codes from 3 months before to 6 months after the SEER diagnosis, we classified the initial <b>biopsy</b> as <b>needle</b> or surgical. By using multivariate logistic regression, we identified patient and tumor characteristics associ-ated with <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> use, and estimated the association between initial biopsy type and likelihood for multiple breast surgeries. RESULTS: <b>Needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> was the initial procedure for 11, 073 (24. 3 %) women.

In this prospective study, {{the impact of the}} introduction of this technique on diagnosis and surgical treatment of nonpalpable breast cancer was assessed in two hospitals in The Netherlands. A total of 84 patients with nonpalpable breast cancer, diagnosed by means of stereotactic large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> (<b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group) were compared with 80 patients diagnosed with nonpalpable breast cancer before the introduction of large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy.</b> These patients were diagnosed by means of needle-localized open breast biopsy (control group). Clinical outcome measures evaluated included: duration of diagnostic and therapeutic intervals and number of surgical procedures required for complete surgical treatment. Subgroup analysis was performed for the category of microcalcifications without tissue distortion. For the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group, the median interval between initial referral to the surgeon and the availability of histological diagnosis was 9 days and the interval between initial referral and complete surgical treatment was 31 days. These intervals were significantly longer for the control group (19 days and 44 days respectively); 75 % of patients in the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group were treated in a single step surgical procedure compared to 16 % of the patients in the control group (67 vs 25 % respectively for the subgroup). The mean number of surgical procedures required to complete surgical treatment was 1. 31 for <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group vs 1. 91 for the open biopsy group (1. 46 vs 1. 84 for the subgroup). Introduction of stereotactic large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> leads to a reduction of the time to diagnosis and the time to complete surgical treatment of nonpalpable breast cancer.

40|$|Background: One of {{the alleged}} {{advantages}} of stereotactic large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> of non-palpable breast lesions is that it entails less inconvenience for the patient. In this prospective study, {{the quality of life}} of patients undergoing large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> was compared with that of patients undergoing open breast biopsy prior to learning the definitive diagnosis. Methods: Thirty patients with non-palpable breast lesions underwent stereotactic large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> as initial diagnostic procedure (<b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group). Quality of life as perceived by these patients was compared with that of 27 patients who underwent open breast biopsy as initial diagnostic procedure (control group), Both groups completed quality of life questionnaires (EuroQol and SF- 36) 1 day before and 4 days after the diagnostic intervention. Results: One day before the diagnostic procedure, the overall estimate for quality of life (measured with the EuroQol) was slightly higher in the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group than in the control group (73 versus 69 resp.). Four days after the diagnostic procedure, the quality of life score remained approximately unchanged in the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group, but was reduced in the control group (71 versus 61 resp.). Results of the SF- 36 questionnaire demonstrated that patients in the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group had higher quality of life scores on physical functioning, physical performance, pain and social performance after the diagnostic intervention. Conclusion: Stereotactic large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> seems to affect quality of life to a lesser extent than open breast biopsy. This difference is mainly attributable to a reduction of physical discomfort and pain. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

All of the Gleason scores of 8 - 10 on <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> were graded correctly. 54 of 162 patients (33 %), with a biopsy Gleason score of < 7 had their cancer upgraded to above 7. Tumors in 18 patients (60 %) with both a Gleason score < 7 on the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> and a Gleason score of 7 for the prostatectomy specimen were confined to the prostate. Conclusion: The potential for grading errors is greatest with well-differentiated tumors and in patients with a Gleason score of < 7 on the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy.</b> Predictions using Gleason scores are sufficiently accurate to warrant its use with all <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies,</b> recognizing that the potential for grading errors is greatest with well-differentiated tumors...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{accuracy}} of an image guided percutaneous core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> (PCNB), using ultrasound or computed tomography, to PCNB without image guidance in the diagnosis of palpable soft tissue tumours. One hundred forty patients with a suspected soft tissue sarcoma underwent a percutaneous core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> with or without image guidance. One hundred eleven patients had subsequent surgical excision. The accuracy of guided PCNB and blind PCNB was calculated by comparing the histological results of the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> to the surgical specimen. The diagnostic accuracy of blind percutaneous core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> was 78 % (36 of 46 biopsies) and was significantly lower (p 0. 025) in comparison to image guided percutaneous core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy,</b> which was 95 % (62 of 65 biopsies). We suggest that image guidance improves the diag-nostic accuracy of PCNB especially for small-size deep sited suspected soft tissue tumours...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the usefulness of}} ultrasound guidance in percutaneous <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> for musculoskeletal tumours. METHODS: Forty-five consecutive patients underwent ultrasound-guided <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy.</b> An additional group of 50 patients who underwent <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> without ultrasound guidance was retrospectively selected as historical control. The sample was considered adequate when a diagnosis can be made, and diagnostic when the diagnosis {{is similar to the}} final report based on the excised tumour. RESULTS: Adequacy of the biopsy samples was 84...|$|R
40|$|For the {{evaluation}} of non-palpable lesions of the breast, image-guided large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> are increasingly replacing needle-localized open breast biopsies. In this study, the diagnostic accuracy of this minimally invasive technique was evaluated by reviewing the available literature. Five cohort studies were included in a meta-analysis. Sensitivity rate, histological agreement between <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> and subsequent surgery or long-term mammographic follow-up and clinical consequences for different disease prevalences were assessed. The sensitivity rate of large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> for the diagnosis of breast cancer was high (97 %). The reclassified agreement rate between core biopsy and subsequent surgical biopsy or long-term mammographic follow-up was also high (94 %). In case of 20 % breast cancer prevalence among women referred after screening (as in the US), {{the risk of breast}} cancer despite benign large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> result is less than 1 %. In European countries, however, prevalence of breast cancer among referred women is 60 – 70 %. This would result in a risk of breast cancer despite benign large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> result of 4 – 6 %. The results of this meta-analysis indicate that the image guided large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> is a promising alternative for the <b>needle</b> localized breast <b>biopsy.</b> However, additional research is needed to explore the limiting factors of the technique. Without such detailed knowledge, a benign histological diagnosis on large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> in countries with high prevalence of malignancy among referred women should be interpreted with caution. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Prostate <b>Needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> are {{stained with}} the PIN- 4 marker {{cocktail}} {{to help the}} pathologist distinguish between HGPIN and adeno-carcinoma. The correct interpretation of multiple IHC markers can be challenging. Therefore we propose the use of computer aided diagnosis algorithms for the identification and classification of glands in a whole slide image of prostate <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy.</b> The paper presents the different {{issues related to the}} automated analysis of prostate <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> and the approach taken by BioImagene in its first generation algorithms...|$|R
40|$|Core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> {{represents}} {{a safe and}} cheap alternative diagnostic method to open biopsy and fine-needle aspiration cytology in head and neck tumors. There is little evidence in the literature {{about the use of}} core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> in minor salivary gland lesions. This single case report presents a 60 -year-old woman with a painless swelling in the soft palate, breathing and swallowing difficulties, and a feeling of suffocation. Two open biopsies had inconclusive diagnosis and the lesion could only be assessed and diagnosed as pleomorphic adenoma through core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy.</b> Recognizing the correct indication of core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> can benefit both health professionals and patients; thus, {{it is important to consider}} the possibility of performing this method to diagnose minor salivary gland tumors...|$|R
30|$|We {{conducted}} a retrospective cross-sectional study of cases with an isolated RS diagnosis based on <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> and subsequent surgical pathology among all patients between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2013. Patients with concomitant atypia, lobular {{carcinoma in situ}} on core biopsy, complete excision of very small RS with <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy,</b> and radiology-pathology discordance were excluded. An upgrade from the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> of RS was defined as surgical excision pathology that revealed ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), and/or invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC).|$|R
