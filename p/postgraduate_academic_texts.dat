40|$|<b>Academic</b> <b>text</b> {{is viewed}} in most {{university}} environments {{as a tool}} for supporting student learning which generates knowledge, skills and the capacity to critique ideas. Yet there is little research undertaken to understand early childhood education (ECE) students’ experiences and beliefs of engaging with <b>academic</b> <b>text.</b> Therefore, in order to understand this specific group of students’ text engagement practices and beliefs, this ethnographic research followed a group of ten third-year ECE students at Victoria University in Wellington New Zealand through one course of their undergraduate study. The researcher collected data using ethnographic methods (including a non-traditional visual participatory method of identity portfolio collages) to identify patterns which help understand students’ beliefs and experiences of engaging with <b>academic</b> <b>text.</b> Based on social learning theories, the research examined the influence of student identity and cultural context on their motivation and interest in engaging with <b>academic</b> <b>text.</b> The study found that while this group of ECE students reported valuing <b>academic</b> <b>text</b> for a number of reasons, they were most likely to engage with assigned text for assessment purposes. The prevalent use of a surface learning approach, skim reading, when reading <b>academic</b> <b>text</b> also left students feeling frustrated with the reading they completed during their programme. Group expectations of reading mainly for assessment and a lack of text engagement by practicing teachers they encountered also encouraged these students, who hold positive reader identities, to limit their engagement with <b>academic</b> <b>text.</b> The results from this study indicate that students and educators can examine ways to increase student motivation to engage deeply with <b>academic</b> <b>text</b> on a more regular basis for students to achieve deeper and more meaningful learning experiences...|$|R

40|$|As a {{consideration}} {{in the design of}} a test of academic literacy, the face validity of such a test is determined by its perceived suitability and usefulness in addressing the literacy requirements of specific academic contexts. This article focuses on one such a literacy context: that of <b>postgraduate</b> <b>academic</b> literacy at a university. In this context, supervisors of postgraduate students will probably expose their students to a <b>postgraduate</b> <b>academic</b> literacy test only if they perceive the testing instrument to be relevant to the needs of their students {{as well as to the}} requirements they have for academic literacy in their disciplines. Consequently, one has to take into consideration the academic literacy expectations of both students and supervisors in a process of test development. The article reports on the results of a survey that was conducted at the University of Pretoria that investigated the perceptions and expectations of both supervisors and students regarding academic literacy abilities and requirements for postgraduate study. It also highlights specifically the implications of the results of the survey for the design of a <b>postgraduate</b> test of <b>academic</b> literacy...|$|R

40|$|This is {{an attempt}} to analyse Korean <b>academic</b> <b>texts</b> to {{formulate}} efficient approaches for teaching Korean academic writing with a consideration on the current circumstances of teaching Korean as a foreign language in Korea. As the number of foreign learners who are learning the Korean language for academic purposes has significantly increased, it becomes necessary to investigate specific features of Korean <b>academic</b> <b>texts</b> and apply the features to the real context of teaching Korean writing, to satisfy the current Korean language learners’ academic needs. Thus, this dissertation has analysed 16 Korean abstracts from postgraduate dissertations written by 16 native speakers of Korean to explore specific features of Korean <b>academic</b> <b>texts.</b> Through the analysis, the researcher discovered that Korean abstracts as examples of Korean academic genres don’t follow the four-part pattern, kisung- chon-kyul, asserted by Eggington (1987). In contrast, they have a three-part pattern (1) purpose (2) summary of structure (3) conclusion, or a four-part pattern adding ‘background of the study’ to the three-part pattern. Moreover, the results have shown that Korean <b>academic</b> <b>texts</b> are rather direct and explicit when making a comparison between the structures of Korean abstracts and a CARS model which was suggested by Swales (1990 b). After the analysis, a teaching model of Korean academic writing that was developed and applied in the real context of teaching Korean, is also discussed. Consequently, it is essential for Korean language learners to have a clear awareness about the way of using the different conventional patterns of organization to write successful <b>academic</b> <b>texts</b> in Korean. For this reason, Korean language teachers and researchers should {{pay more attention to the}} text-based genre analyses on Korean <b>academic</b> <b>texts</b> for efficient teaching of Korean academic writing to the learners...|$|R
