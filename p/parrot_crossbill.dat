25|$|The wooded slopes are host {{to their}} own bird species, in {{particular}} the ring ouzel, the common raven, and the golden eagle. More generally, the forests have Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, <b>parrot</b> <b>crossbills,</b> red crossbills, common redstarts , bramblings and Siberian jays, which last bird is {{the symbol of the}} park.|$|R
5|$|Spring {{migration}} is relatively quiet, although sightings of ring ouzel and firecrest are possible amongst {{the more common}} arrivals. Breeding birds include lapwings, common snipe, pied avocets, common redshanks and marsh harriers on the grazing marshes, ringed plovers and little terns on the beach, and black-headed, herring and lesser black-backed gulls on the salt marsh. The small grey heron colony has been joined by little egrets, and, from 2010, by Eurasian spoonbills. The pines may occasionally have nesting siskins or common <b>crossbills,</b> and <b>parrot</b> <b>crossbills</b> bred in 1984 and 1985.|$|R
50|$|Work on {{vocalisation}} in North America {{suggests that}} there are eight or nine discrete populations of red crossbill in that continent alone, which do not interbreed and are (like the named species) adapted to specialise in different conifer species. While several ornithologists seem inclined to give these forms species status, no division of the American red crossbills has yet occurred. Preliminary investigations in Europe and Asia suggest an equal, if not greater, complexity, with several different call types identified; these call types being as different from each other as from the named species Scottish and <b>parrot</b> <b>crossbills</b> - suggesting either that they are valid species, or else that the Scottish and parrot may not be.|$|R

The 's length along the culmen is one of the regular measurements made during bird ringing and is particularly useful in feeding studies. The shape or colour of the culmen can also help with the identification of birds in the field.

50|$|Research in Scotland {{has shown}} that red, <b>parrot</b> and Scottish <b>crossbills</b> are reproductively isolated, and the {{diagnostic}} calls and bill dimensions have not been lost. They are therefore good species.|$|R
50|$|The {{species of}} crossbills are {{difficult}} to separate, and care is needed even with the two-barred/Hispaniolan crossbill, the easiest. The other species are identified by subtle differences in head shape and bill size, and the identification problems formerly led to much taxonomic speculation, with some scientists considering that the <b>parrot</b> and Scottish <b>crossbills</b> and possibly the Hispaniolan and two-barred crossbills are conspecific.|$|R
50|$|Genetic {{research}} on their DNA failed to reveal {{any difference between}} any of the crossbills (including the morphologically distinct two-barred), with variation between individuals greater than any difference between the taxa. This led to the suggestion that limited interbreeding between the different types prevented significant genetic differentiation, and enabled each type to maintain a degree of morphological plasticity, which {{may be necessary to}} enable them to feed on different conifers when their preferred food species has a crop failure. Research in Scotland, however, has shown that the <b>parrot</b> and Scottish <b>crossbills</b> are reproductively isolated, and also from the common crossbill, despite irruption of that species into their ranges, and the diagnostic calls and bill dimensions have not been lost. They are therefore good species.|$|R
50|$|Within its Eurasian range, {{this species}} is smaller-headed and smaller-billed than <b>parrot</b> <b>crossbill</b> and Scottish crossbill, so the main {{confusion}} species both {{there and in}} North America is common or red crossbill.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>parrot</b> <b>crossbill</b> (Loxia pytyopsittacus) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird in the finch family Fringillidae. The {{scientific name}} is from Ancient Greek.

50|$|The British Ornithologists Union first classed the Scottish {{crossbill}} as {{a separate}} and distinct species in 1980, but some ornithologists believed there was insufficient scientific research for its status. It {{was considered to be}} possibly a race of either the red crossbill or the <b>parrot</b> <b>crossbill,</b> both of which also occur in the Caledonian Forest.|$|E
50|$|The crossbills are characterised by the mandibles {{crossing}} {{at their}} tips, {{which gives the}} group its English name. They are specialist feeders on conifer cones, and the unusual bill shape is an adaptation to assist the extraction of the seeds from the cone. The <b>parrot</b> <b>crossbill</b> is a specialist feeder on the cones of Scots pine.|$|E
50|$|The Cairngorms {{provide a}} unique alpine semi-tundra moorland habitat, {{home to many}} rare plants, birds and animals. Speciality bird species on the plateaux include {{breeding}} ptarmigan, dotterel, snow bunting, golden eagle, ring ouzel, and red grouse, with snowy owl, twite, purple sandpiper and Lapland bunting seen on occasion. In the forests, capercaillie, black grouse, Scottish crossbill, <b>parrot</b> <b>crossbill</b> and crested tit are found.|$|E

50|$|Some large-billed, pine-feeding populations {{currently}} {{assigned to}} this {{species in the}} Mediterranean area may possibly be better referred to either <b>parrot</b> <b>crossbill</b> or to new species in their own right, but more research is needed. These include Balearic crossbill L. curvirostra balearica and North African crossbill L. curvirostra poliogyna, feeding primarily on Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis); Cyprus crossbill L. curvirostra guillemardi, feeding primarily on European black pine (Pinus nigra); and an as-yet unidentified crossbill with a parrot crossbill-size bill feeding primarily on Bosnian pine (Pinus heldreichii) in the Balkans. These populations also differ on plumage, with the Balearic, North African and Cyprus races having yellower males, and the Balkan type having deep purple-pink males; this however merely reflects the differing anthocyanin content of the cones they feed on, as these pigments are transferred to the feathers.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} {{difficult}} to separate from <b>parrot</b> <b>crossbill</b> and Scottish crossbill, both of which breed within its Eurasian range, as plumage distinctions from those two species are negligible, though the head and bill are smaller than in either of the other species. Care is needed in identification, especially in Eurasia, where the glip or chup call {{is probably the best}} indicator. The identification problem is less severe in North America, where only red crossbill and White-winged crossbill occur. However, there has been debate as to whether different call types should be considered separate species. For example, the South Hills crossbill, occurring in the South Hills and Albion Mountains in Idaho {{has been described as a}} new species (Loxia sinesciuris) because it shows a very low degree of hybridization with the red crossbill. There are also genetic differences between the call type populations. Nevertheless, few ornithologists have chosen to give these forms species status.|$|E
40|$|This {{report by}} the Slovenian Rarities Committee {{presents}} records of rare bird species in Slovenia in 2015, with some addenda for previous years. The numbers in brackets refer {{to the number of}} records (first number) and individuals (second number) recorded between 1 Jan 1950 and 31 Dec 2014. Since 1 Jan 2013, submission to the Committee has been required for 37 additional species, 17 of which are regional rarities. Records of these species are not numbered, since records from previous years were not collected by the Committee. One new species, the Desert Wheatear Oenanthe deserti, was added to category A. Other notable observations were the first record of <b>Parrot</b> <b>Crossbill</b> Loxia pytyopsittacus after 1909, the second record of Baillon’s Crake Zapornia pusilla, the third and fourth records of Calandra Lark Melanocorypha calandra, the fourth of Long-legged Buzzard Buteo rufinus, the fifth of Richard’s Pipit Anthus richardi and the sixth of Grey Phalarope Phalaropus fulicarius. Four species were added to category E: Bahama Pintail Anas bahamensis, Rosy-billed Pochard Netta peposaca, Harris’s Hawk Parabuteo unicinctus and Alexandrine Parakeet Psittacula eupatria. The list of birds recorded in Slovenia (as of 31 Dec 2015) contains 386 species (371 in category A, 6 in category B, 9 exclusively in category C; 4 species are both in categories A and C). Category D contains 6 species, while category E contains 38, two of which are classified into subcategory E*. These two categories {{are not part of the}} list...|$|E
40|$|In 2015, 170 {{bird species}} were {{recorded}} during bird ringing activities in Slovenia. We ringed 73, 371 birds belonging to 162 species, there were 132 foreign recoveries of birds ringed in Slovenia, 120 recoveries of birds ringed abroad and found in Slovenia, {{as well as}} 1964 local recoveries. The most frequently ringed species were Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla and Great Tit Parus major. In ringed nestlings, Great Tits and Tree Sparrows Passer montanus predominated. In 2015, the first preliminary ringing of Scops Owls Otus scops during migration took place, resulting in {{the highest number of}} Scops Owls ringed so far. Concerning recoveries of birds ringed in Slovenia and later recorded abroad and birds ringed abroad and later recorded in Slovenia, the commonest were Mute Swans Cygnus olor and Black-headed Gulls Chroicocephalus ridibundus. The longest-distance recovery concerned a Reed Bunting Emberiza schoeniculus found in Sweden (2, 144 km away). Among the interesting finds were also the first finds of ringed Pygmy Cormorants Microcarbo pygmeus so far from breeding sites in Hungary. Among rare species, Yellow-browed Warbler Phylloscopus inornatus, Spanish Sparrow Passer hispaniolensis and a pair of Parrot Crossbills Loxia pytyopsittacus were caught and ringed, the latter {{for the very first time}} in Slovenia after more than 100 years. An overview of records of the <b>Parrot</b> <b>Crossbill</b> is given herein, as well as analysis of irruptive years of the Red Crossbills Loxia curvirostra between 1980 and 2015, when the probability of boreal Crossbill species occurrence is the highest. According to the ringers’ data, the irruptive years of Red Crossbills in Slovenia were 1984, 1985, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The article points to the probability that Parrot Crossbills have been overlooked in the past, since larger specimens of Crossbills were ringed mostly in irruptive years, but no specific bill measurements important for distinguishing between Parrot and Red Crossbill had been taken...|$|E
40|$|The {{survey was}} part-financed by Scottish Natural Heritage"A survey of Scottish Crossbills Loxia scotica {{was carried out}} in 3, 506 km 2 of conifer {{woodland}} in northern Scotland during January to April 2008 to provide the first estimate of the global population size for this endemic bird. Population estimates were also made for Common Crossbills L. curvirostra and Parrot Crossbills L. pytyopsittacus within this range. Crossbills were lured to systematically selected survey points for counting, sexing and recording their calls for later call-type (species) identification from sonograms. Crossbills were located at 451 of the 852 survey points, and adequate tape-recordings made at 387 of these. The Scottish Crossbill had a disjunct distribution, occurring largely within {{the eastern part of the}} study area, but also in the northwest. Common Crossbills had a mainly westerly distribution. The population size of postjuvenile Scottish Crossbills was estimated as 13, 600 (95 %C. I. 8, 130 – 22, 700), which will approximate to 6, 800 (4, 065 – 11, 350) pairs. Common Crossbills were more abundant within this range (27, 100, 95 % C. I. 14, 700 – 38, 400) and Parrot Crossbills rare (about 100). The sex ratio was not significantly different from parity for Scottish Crossbills. The modal number at survey points was two but numbers were larger in January than later in the survey. The numbers and distribution of all crossbill species are likely to vary between years, depending upon the size of the cone crops of the different conifers: all were coning in 2008. Common Crossbill and <b>Parrot</b> <b>Crossbill</b> numbers will also be affected by irruptions from continental Europe. A monitoring scheme is required to detect any population trend, and further work on their habitat requirement (e. g. conifer selection at different seasons) is needed to inform habitat management of native and planted conifer forests to ensure a secure future for this endemic bird.

40|$|From 2007 inclusive, NINA has {{received}} economic support {{for research on}} wind power and birds from the Norwegian Research Council (NFR) through the RENERGI-programme. The project is named Pre- and post-construction studies of conflicts between birds and wind turbines in coastal Norway (BirdWind). BirdWind is approaching its finalisation; with 2010 as the last ordinary year where data-collecting activities takes place. In 2009 the project was significantly strengthened through a new PhD-position funded by Statkraft and NINA. The position is held for four years, and the overall aim of the work conducted by the PhD-student is to model the future white-tailed eagle (WTE) population development based on reproduction and mortality data. Weekly searches with dogs for birds killed within the wind-power plant {{have been carried out}} throughout the year; in general searches are conducted every 7 days (plus or minus one day). 25 ‘primary turbines’ are selected and searched together with one of two dogs. A full search of all turbines is performed at larger intervals. In 2009 (up to December 1) 31 specimens of at least 8 species have been re-corded. The most frequent victims are willow ptarmigan and WTE with 10 and 7 carcasses, re-spectively. Of waders 3 common snipes have been recorded. Five carcasses were recorded of hooded crow, and single carcasses of <b>parrot</b> <b>crossbill,</b> northern wheatear, teal and mallard. Some records from earlier years have been revised as collision victims or not. Also in 2009 censuses for willow ptarmigan have been carried out in spring and autumn on Smøla and Hitra. The preliminary results do not indicate any obvious differences between the two areas, but autumn density in the wind-power plant area seems to be more stable compared to the control area. Interestingly the higher density within the wind-power plant area in autumn is evened out in spring each year, so also in spring 2009. To obtain data on habitat selection, movements, collision risks, survival of eggs, chicks and adults and general population dynamic parameters, willow ptarmigan specimen have been radio-tagged in 2008 - 2009. The activities regarding breeding waders and small birds (mainly passerines) have this year focused on the EIA-activities on Hitra in connection to the planned extension of the existing power plant on Hitra I; the Hitra II Wind-Power Plant. Since 2003, 50 nestlings of white-tailed eagle have been equipped with satellite transmitters. In 2009, eight WTE nestlings were tagged, six with solar-powered and two with battery-powered transmit-ters. One was tagged within the wind-power plant, the others in close vicinity of it. The solar-powered transmitters used in 2009 were programmed to give one position per hour during sum-mer in order to have finer resolution of movements for risk-modelling purposes. During winter less frequent downloading is scheduled, due to low light and poor battery-charging. One of the tagged nestlings was found killed by a turbine October 7. We have continued to collect feathers from ac-tive nests and chicks also in 2009, as well as from eagles killed in collisions with wind turbines. DNA-analyses from bones of six eagles killed by electrocution on power-line pylons on Smøla will also be included. For increased efficiency in the laboratory, and to streamline the production of DNA-data, the use of an extraction robot has been implemented. All WTE nest sites on Smøla were surveyed during the summer. Territorial activity, identified by either moulted adult feathers, chicks in the nest or fresh nest material, was confirmed in 61 different territories on the main is-land and in the surrounding archipelago. In these territories 27 chicks from 21 different clutches were recorded.
