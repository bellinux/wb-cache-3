5|$|During the Ohio Constitutional Convention in 1802, {{the delegates}} {{allegedly}} received reports from a fur trapper that Lake Michigan extended significantly farther south than {{had previously been}} believed (or mapped). Thus, {{it was possible that}} an east–west line extending east from Lake Michigan's southern tip might intersect Lake Erie somewhere east of Maumee Bay, or worse, might not intersect the lake at all; the farther south that Lake Michigan actually extended, the more land Ohio would lose, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> entire Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne {{lost only}} one starter, Aaron Jackson, from the 2008–09 team which {{ended with a}} record of 21–13, the first time since 1981 that the school had 20 or more wins in a season. Picked to finish 12th in the Atlantic 10, Duquesne went on to finish second, losing to Temple by only five points in the conference {{championship}} game. This earned Duquesne a bid into the National Invitation Tournament, its first postseason appearance since 1994. The team was eliminated in a double-overtime first round loss to Virginia Tech, but the Dukes' unlikely success inspired the hope of a return to the NIT, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> NCAA tournament.|$|E
5|$|Edin's Hall Broch in Berwickshire is {{the best}} {{preserved}} southern broch and although the ruins are superficially similar {{to some of the}} larger Orcadian broch villages {{it is unlikely that the}} tower was ever more than a single story high. There is an absence of Roman artefacts at this site. Various theories for the existence of these structures have been proposed, including their construction by northern invaders following the withdrawal of Roman troops after the Agricolan advance, or by allies of Rome encouraged to emulate the impressive northern style in order to suppress native resistance, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> Orcadian chiefs whose positive relationship with Rome may have continued from the beginnings of Romano-British relations.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} – {{most notably}} Lajos Ligeti (1950/51) and Edwin G.

Marácz claimed, however, that any purportedly Yeniseian words could also have Mongolian and/or Turkic origins.|$|E
25|$|The Hayabusa {{has been}} one of the top choices for streetbike customization, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> most popular {{customized}} sportbike. One reason may be the unique, instantly recognizable bodywork. The easy tunability of the engine, the wide selection of aftermarket parts, possibly more than any other Japanese motorcycle, and the interchangeability between models of Suzuki parts have also played a role. It was the vibrancy of this custom scene that prompted Suzuki to send Koji Yoshirua to the US for feedback and inspiration for the second generation design.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{example of}} the script's usage was a dedicatory inscription over the west door {{of the church of}} Saint Sarkis in Tekor. Based on the known individuals mentioned in the inscription, it has been dated to the 480s. The earliest known surviving example of usage outside of Armenia is a mid-6th century mosaic inscription in the chapel of St Polyeuctos in Jerusalem. A papyrus discovered in 1892 at Fayyum and containing Greek words written in Armenian script has been dated on historical grounds to before the Arab conquest of Egypt, i.e. before 640, and on paleographic grounds to the 6th century and <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> late 5th century. It is now in the Bibliotheque Nationale de France. The earliest surviving manuscripts written in Armenian using Armenian script date from the 7th-8th century.|$|E
25|$|Led by first-year {{head coach}} Gary Andersen, the Badgers entered the {{bowl with a}} nine win, three loss record. Headed into their final game, Wisconsin {{appeared}} on track to appear in a BCS Bowl, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> Rose Bowl, but after giving up numerous big plays, they were upset by the Penn State Nittany Lions. This ended their hopes of a BCS berth, though {{it turned out to}} be moot as Michigan State beat Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game, assuring Michigan State a trip to the Rose Bowl and virtually ensuring that the Big Ten's other potential BCS berth would go to the previously-ranked #2 Ohio State. Prior to their loss to Penn State, the Badgers had won six consecutive games after starting the season 3–2 with losses to Arizona State and Ohio State. The 2014 edition of the Capital One bowl marked the fourth time in the previous ten seasons that Wisconsin would play in Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium (the game had various names during the span).|$|E
25|$|Díaz was a {{political}} pragmatist and not an ideologue, likely seeing that the religious question re-opened political discord in Mexico. When he rebelled against Lerdo, Díaz had at least the tacit and <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> explicit support of the Church. When he {{came to power in}} 1877, Díaz left the anti-clerical laws in place, but no longer enforced them as state policy, leaving that to individual Mexican states. This led to the re-emergence of the Church in many areas, but in others a less full role. The Church flouted the Reform prohibitions against wearing clerical garb, there were open-air processions and Masses, and religious orders existed. The Church also recovered its property, sometimes through intermediaries, and tithes were again collected. The Church regained its role in education, with the complicity of the Díaz regime which did not put money into public education. The Church also regained its role in running charitable institutions. Despite an increasingly visible role of the Catholic Church during the Porfiriato, the Vatican was unsuccessful in getting the reinstatement of a formal relationship between the papacy and Mexico, and the constitutional limitations of the Church as an institution remained the law of the land.|$|E

500|$|Sigtrygg's long reign spanned 46years, {{until his}} abdication in 1036. [...] During that period, his armies saw action {{in four of}} the five Irish provinces of the time. In particular, he {{conducted}} a long series of raids into territories such as Meath, Wicklow, Ulster, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> coast of Wales. [...] He also came into conflict with rival Norse kings, especially in Cork and Waterford.|$|E
500|$|Ranulf {{acquired}} {{the reputation of}} an able financier and administrator, and helped to increase the royal revenues. He appears to have played {{an important part in}} the compilation of the Domesday survey, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> main orchestrator of the project. Domesday Book gives his profession as clerk, and records him holding land in a number of counties. Before the death of the old king he became chaplain to Maurice, Bishop of London, whom he had formerly served in the chancery. Some sources call him [...] "almost illiterate", but this probably meant he was not formally educated in the liberal arts. His work in the chancery and as an administrator would have required knowledge of Latin. He also served as the keeper of the king's seal from about 1085. Once, while he was travelling in the Thames estuary with the seal, he was captured by pirates. Thinking quickly, he prevented the capture of the seal by throwing the seal into the sea. Although he served William the Conqueror, he does not attest a single genuine charter or writ of William's, which implies he was not a leading servant. When King William died and his lands were split between his elder son Robert Curthose, who received Normandy, and the third son, William Rufus, who received England, Ranulf chose to serve Rufus in England.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Rick Florino of Artistdirect was very positive on the album, writing {{that the film}} [...] "hearkens back to the good old days, and the film's soundtrack is not {{only one of the}} best soundtracks this year, it's also bound to be remembered as a classic." [...] The writer praised Browning's take on [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)", writing that it [...] "adds a lush darkness and vibrant vulnerability to the song reminiscent of Portishead's Beth Gibbons but with a flair all her own." [...] Florino awarded the album four and a half stars out of five, and concluded his review, writing, [...] "This is the kind of soundtrack that needs to be listened to from front to back, and if it's any indication, the film is destined {{to be one of the}} most mind-blowing and magnificent screen event this year, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> decade." [...] Allmusic's Heather Phares reviewed the album positively, praising Browning for [...] "deliver the soundtrack’s most affecting performances". Phares concluded her review with [...] "Sucker Punch is elaborate and sometimes overwrought, but it’s absolutely true to the film’s aesthetic." [...] Billboard reviewer Phil Gallo described the soundtrack as [...] "a rush of male-targeted female power" [...] which de Vries and Bates scored with [...] "dark, eerie and violent soundscapes". Gallo found Yoav's contribution to [...] "Where Is My Mind" [...] to be [...] "the soundtrack's most tender moment". Writing for Empire, Danny Graydon highlighted Browning's songs as [...] "seductive takes", and praised both Gugino and Isaac for [...] "an exuberant version of Roxy Music’s 'Love Is The Drug'" [...] and considering Björk's collaboration [...] "magnificently reversions 'Army Of Me' with Skunk Anansie". Jon M. Gilbertson of Milwaukee Journal Sentinel was not very fond of the album, writing that [...] "Maybe these covers make more sense in filmic context, but on their own they exude an air of pointlessness. They are, like Snyder's movies, stylish but curiously hollow." ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} quotes in the plays of William Shakespeare {{referring}} to dollars as money.
