5|$|As governor, Ford raised {{revenue from}} a {{severance}} tax on coal, a two-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline, {{and an increased}} corporate tax. He balanced these increases by exempting food from the state sales tax. The resulting large budget surplus allowed him to propose several construction projects. His victory in the primary had been largely due to Jefferson County, and he returned the favor by approving funds to build the Commonwealth Convention Center and expand the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center. He also shepherded a <b>package</b> <b>of</b> reforms to the state's criminal justice system through the first legislative session of his term.|$|E

40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) Vif protein plays {{a critical role in}} the production of infectious virions. Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of small amounts of Vif in virus particles. However, Vif packaging was assumed to be nonspecific, and its functional significance has been questioned. We now report that <b>packaging</b> <b>of</b> Vif is dependent on the <b>packaging</b> <b>of</b> viral genomic RNA in both permissive and restrictive HIV- 1 target cells. Mutations in the nucleocapsid zinc finger domains that abrogate <b>packaging</b> <b>of</b> viral genomic RNA abolished <b>packaging</b> <b>of</b> Vif. Additionally, an RNA packaging-defective virus exhibited significantly reduced <b>packaging</b> <b>of</b> Vif. Finally, deletion of a putative RNA-interacting domain in Vif abolished <b>packaging</b> <b>of</b> Vif into virions. Virion-associated Vif was resistant to detergent extraction and copurified with components of the viral nucleoprotein complex and functional reverse transcription complexes. Thus, Vif is specifically packaged into virions as a component of the viral nucleoprotein complex. Our data suggest that the specific association of Vif with the viral nucleoprotein complex might be functionally significant and could be a critical requirement for infectivity of viruses produced from restrictive host cells...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the effect <b>of</b> varied <b>packages</b> <b>of</b> training on selected physiological variables of college women basketball players. Thirty subjects were selected from the Alagappa University College of Physical Education in Karaikudi and their age ranged from 19 to 23 years. The subjects were equally divided into three groups namely control and two experimental groups with ten subjects in each group. Control group (Group I) did not undergo any training programme rather than their daily routine work. The experimental group (Group II) underwent varied <b>packages</b> <b>of</b> training I (General training) and experimental group (Group III) were treated with varied <b>packages</b> <b>of</b> training II (Basketball skill related). Training was given for a period of 8 weeks, trained forty five minutes duration for six weeks except Sunday. Anaerobic power and Cardio respiratory endurance were measured through field tests. The Anaerobic power and Cardio respiratory endurance was measured before and after the completion <b>of</b> varied <b>packages</b> <b>of</b> training. The results of pre-test and post-test were statistically analysed by using Analysis of Co-variance. The result revealed that Anaerobic power and Cardio respiratory endurance had significant improvement due to the practices <b>of</b> varied <b>packages</b> <b>of</b> training when compared to the control group.

5|$|As {{the demonstrations}} continued, Ambassador Nolting managed to extract {{theoretical}} concessions from Diệm on 18 May. Diệm agreed a modest compensation <b>package</b> <b>of</b> USD $7000 {{for the families}} of the victims as a conciliatory gesture. Diệm also agreed to dismiss those responsible for the shootings. However, the publicly stated reason for this action was that the officials had failed to maintain order, rather than that they had been responsible for the deaths of the protesters. Despite these concessions, Diệm maintained that his government was not responsible for the deaths, resolutely continuing to blame the Việt Cộng. It was enough to satisfy Nolting, who immediately departed for his vacation. His absence allowed the remaining American diplomatic staff led by William Trueheart, Nolting's deputy, to end Nolting's policy of appeasing Diệm.|$|E
5|$|For {{five years}} after the {{expansion}} era contract with ESPN ended in 1997, the CFL was absent on American television. At the end of 2001 the league began a relationship with America One that would last until 2009. Coverage was relatively generous with 43 games, including the playoffs, covered in the last year. A more modest deal of 14 games was negotiated with the NFL Network in 2010, which lasted two years. The 2012 season began without a contract and the league resorted to internet broadcasts on ESPN3 until NBC Sports Network agreed to a 14-game regular season <b>package</b> <b>of</b> its own; unlike the NFL network, NBC opted to broadcast games during the NFL preseason as well as cover the playoffs and Grey Cup. Both the NBC and ESPN deals were renewed in 2013 with a slight scaling back of playoff coverage and ESPN2 also picking up a handful of games in the summer months. American broadcasts have been simulcasts of game coverage from Canadian networks.|$|E
