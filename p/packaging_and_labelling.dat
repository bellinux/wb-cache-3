25|$|Some 90% of United Kingdom exports go to metric {{countries}} (as only Liberia, Burma and the United States {{have not}} adopted the International System of Units), {{and there are}} costs to business of maintaining two production lines (one for exports to the US in US customary units, {{and the other for}} domestic sales and exports {{to the rest of the}} world in metric). These have been estimated at 3% of annual turnover by the Institute of Production Engineers, and at £1.1billion (1980) per annum by the CBI. Regardless of United Kingdom metrication, goods produced in the United Kingdom for export to the United States would have still been labelled in non-metric units to comply with the US Fair <b>Packaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>Labelling</b> Act.|$|E

30|$|Sample {{analysis}} for each {{sample consisted of}} visual inspection of the <b>packaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>labeling,</b> <b>and</b> determination of registration status, expiration date, country of manufacture, biochemical analysis, and company of manufacture. An online database developed by the Ministry of Health in Mongolia (Licemed) and archive documents from the registration of drugs were used to complete the visual inspection. The database includes information such as size, color, <b>labeling</b> <b>and</b> numbers of the <b>packages</b> <b>and</b> <b>labeling.</b> In addition, the WHO guideline for the Development of Measures to Combat Counterfeit Drugs was used. (World Health Organization 1999) A sample was considered suspicious if the <b>package</b> <b>and</b> <b>labeling</b> was not consistent with registered information for that drug and manufacturer. Samples with suspicious <b>packaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>labeling</b> {{were sent to the}} manufacturers for confirmation.

2500|$|The health-freedom {{movement}} vehemently {{opposes the}} Guidelines for Vitamin and Mineral Food Supplements, {{adopted by the}} Codex Alimentarius Commission as a voluntary standard at its meeting in Rome in July 2005, which includes requirements for the <b>packaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>labelling</b> of vitamin and mineral supplements. The text specifies that [...] "supplements should contain vitamins/provitamins and minerals whose nutritional value for human beings has been proven by scientific data and whose status as vitamins and minerals is recognised by FAO and WHO." [...] In addition, it states that the [...] "sources of vitamins and minerals may be either natural or synthetic" [...] and that [...] "their selection {{should be based on}} considerations such as safety and bioavailability." ...|$|E
2500|$|First, if a Directive's {{deadline}} for implementation is not met, the member state cannot enforce conflicting laws, and a citizen may {{rely on the}} Directive in such an action (so called [...] "vertical" [...] direct effect). So, in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73/173/EEC on <b>packaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>labelling</b> solvents by the deadline, it was estopped from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Ratti's solvent and varnish business. A member state could [...] "not rely, as against individuals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails". Second, a citizen or company can also invoke a Directive as a defence in a dispute with another citizen or company (not just a public authority) which is attempting to enforce a national law that conflicts with a Directive. So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors {{that it had not}} complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems, on the basis that it had not been notified to the Commission as a Directive required. Third, if a Directive gives expression to a [...] "general principle" [...] of EU law, it can be invoked between private non-state parties before its {{deadline for}} implementation. This follows from Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code §622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal. Ms Kücükdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH & Co KG before her dismissal. She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law. Fourth, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers. This could also be true if the enterprise is privatised, as it was held with a water company that was responsible for basic water provision.|$|E
