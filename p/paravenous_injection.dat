40|$|Background: Totally implantable {{vascular}} access devices (TIVAD) {{are considered}} {{safe and reliable}} for the administration of intravenous therapies, including chemotherapy and blood sampling. They provide direct vascular access through a simple percutaneous puncture. However, {{in order to avoid}} <b>paravenous</b> <b>injection,</b> it is mandatory to check for blood withdrawal before administering medication: this simple procedure confirms both the system’s patency, correct needle position in the chamber and the catheter tip’s intravascular location. This study’s objective was to evaluate the incidence of partial and total blood withdrawal impairment in TIVADs directly after accessing the port system. Material and Methods: From November 2003 to March 2004, nurses from 20 hospitals in Flanders (Belgium) agreed {{to take part in a}} prospective cohort study and collect data on TIVAD access procedures in cancer patients. In case of blood withdrawal problems or device occlusion, they recorded all actions needed for diagnosing the cause of the problem and restoring patency. In each hospital, TIVAD maintenance and solutions for troubleshooting were performed according to individual institutional protocols. Results: The data included 8685 accesses in 2853 patients. The incidence of blood withdrawal occlusion and total occlusion were 11. 11 % and 0. 24 % respectively. Overall incidence varied between hospitals from 3. 05 % to 28. 37 %. Nurses restored full device patency in 53. 25 % of cases, mostly by changing patients’ position or intrathoracic pressure, additional flushing and repositioning of the Huber needle in the port septum. In 83. 51 % of persistent occlusions, no further investigation into the cause of the functional impairment was undertaken. Thirty-one events of occlusion (3. 14 %) were treated by thrombolytics or device replacement. Altogether, blood aspiration was regained in 55. 17 %. Conclusions: Withdrawal and total occlusion problems occurred in 11. 35 % of TIVAD access and were resolved by nurses’ interventions in 53. 25 % of cases. The incidence expressed in function of the number of punctures reflects accurately the impact of this problem in daily practice. The differences between hospitals revealed that prevention of occlusion and established protocols for maintenance or troubleshooting solutions are important factors to maintain optimal TIVAD patency and deserves further analyses. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Oesophageal {{stricture}} and dysphagia after endoscopic sclerotherapy of oesophageal varices {{were assessed}} {{with regard to}} occurrence and severity and the relation to the treatment. We followed 34 patients for three to 47 months who had two to 25 treatments with submucosal, <b>paravenous</b> <b>injections</b> of polidocanol (3 %). Twenty patients (59 %) developed stricture or dysphagia; 14 both dysphagia and endoscopically verified stricture, two dysphagia without stricture, and four stricture without dysphagia. Both phenomena occurred intermittently and often independent of each other, but occupied median 38 % of the observation time in these 20 patients. The patients developing strictures had received significantly more treatments and greater amount of sclerosant, and they had significantly more preceding mucosal necroses. The varices were eradicated to about the same degree and the incidence of recurrent haemorrhage {{was the same as}} in the patients who had not developed stricture...|$|R
30|$|The mice {{were given}} i.p. {{injections}} of 13  MBq of 18 [*]F-FDG. The i.p. route was preferred over i.v. administration to prevent potential <b>paravenous</b> <b>injections</b> {{due to the}} very small calibre of the murine tail veins which could have significantly altered the biodistribution of 18 [*]F-FDG in our tumour model. Fueger et al. performed a comparison of i.v. versus i.p. injection of 18 [*]F-FDG and found a comparable distribution of the tracer for intravenous and intraperitoneal injection after 60  min. [9]. The prolonged uptake time of 3  h was chosen to allow for optimal background clearance. Anaesthetics were injected 10  min before imaging. The mice {{were placed in the}} prone position. Scan time was 15  min, using an isotropic voxel size of 1  mm and a matrix of 128 × 128 × 120  voxels. All images were reconstructed with a fully three-dimensional iterative reconstruction algorithm (3 D–Ramla). Axial images were reformatted with coronal orientation using multiplanar reconstruction (MPR).|$|R
