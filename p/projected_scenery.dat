50|$|Wilfred {{was also}} an early pioneer in working with <b>projected</b> <b>scenery</b> for the theatre. His initial success in this was a 1930 Broadway {{production}} of Ibsen's The Vikings. Wilfred did seminal work in the 1950s with the University of Washington's John Ashby Conway in this field.|$|E
50|$|In 2007 {{he began}} {{presenting}} The Mitch Show, {{a collection of}} his short films together with new audience-participation pieces. One of the latter is Podpeople, a descendant of his dance work, Walkpeople. Podpeople features five audience volunteers who receive dialogue and movement prompting from iPods as they integrate themselves into <b>projected</b> <b>scenery.</b> In June 2007 he presented The Mitch Show in Kosovo as a Cultural Envoy for the U.S. Department of State.|$|E
5000|$|In rear projection, (often called process shooting) {{background}} images (called [...] "plates", {{whether they}} are still pictures or moving) are photographed first. For example, a camera car may drive along streets or roads while photographing the changing scene behind it. In the studio, the resulting [...] "background plate" [...] is loaded into a projector with the film [...] "flipped" [...] (reversed), {{because it will be}} projected onto (and through) the back of a translucent screen. A car containing the performers is aligned in front of the screen so that the scenery appears through its rear and/or side windows. A camera in front of the car records both the foreground action and the <b>projected</b> <b>scenery,</b> as the performers pretend to drive.|$|E

50|$|With <b>projected</b> <b>scenery,</b> cycs and scrims {{may be used}} as drops, by {{employing}} either front or rear projection. This was done in a general sense in the 1910s and 1920s by means of painted glass plates in front of lighting instruments, which made sculptured shadows on the cyc to indicate such images as a cityscape or a scary dungeon. (Focus was generalized in the early days; nowadays we have projectors with adjustable lenses.) Lighting instruments (generally ellipsoidals) may also be used to project scenic effects on cycs and scrims, by using gobos, also known as templates or patterns. With an ellipsoidal reflector, the light source is positioned at one focal point of the three-dimensional ellipse, then the pattern - cut metal or glass or other heat-resistant material - is positioned in reverse position so that the light escaping the instrument passes through the pattern first, then through the other focal point and the lenses, and is projected upon the cyc or scrim.|$|E
40|$|New {{technologies}} have made lighting more prominent in live performances of all kinds, not just stage theatre, {{and in many}} courses lighting has been subsumed into `performance lighting'. Performance Lighting Design is a practical guide to the art and technique of lighting for the stage, concerts, and live events. The book will also cover the use of projected images in performance including <b>projected</b> <b>scenery</b> on the West End stage, in fringe shows, and on the stadium "rock" stage, {{as well as the}} use of images from live camera and from other sources as "performers". The book will serve students of lighting design and will also be accessible to anyone with an awareness of technical theatre. Practical knowledge is combined with aesthetic and theoretical considerations. The book will also address the difficult area of getting inspiration and evolving design ideas through a broad range of performance genre. The author will discuss {{the pros and cons of}} several computer based techniques, and incorporate 25 years of his own professional experience in the UK and Europe...|$|E

5000|$|The {{project will}} also {{contribute}} to regional development through various plans that utilize the infrastructure planned in the <b>project</b> and the <b>scenery.</b> The examples are ‘Four major rivers that flow with culture’ of Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism, and ‘Creating a vivid land of beautiful scenery’ of Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries.|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} for this song, {{directed}} by Michel Gondry, depicts Jack White {{coming back to}} his trashed London house and surveying reckless destruction. While he goes from room to room, video of the party {{events that led to}} the decimation (and of his and Meg's relationship before he left) is <b>projected</b> over the <b>scenery,</b> until in the final scene she leaves him.|$|R
25|$|Little Italy – this {{neighborhood}} {{consists of the}} area around Union Street and Lincoln streets, between Pennsylvania Avenue and Lancaster Avenue. Anchored by the immigration waves of the late 19th century and early 20th century, Little Italy has retained its roots, even as neighborhood remodeling <b>projects</b> update the <b>scenery.</b> A central feature of the neighborhood is the St. Anthony's of Padua Roman Catholic Church. The neighborhood hosts an annual Italian Festival in the summertime.|$|R
40|$|In visual art, {{a single}} static image frequent-ly {{represents}} {{much more than}} <b>projected</b> 3 D <b>scenery.</b> Artists include subtle visual elements outlin-ing movements, indicating past or future events, sketch-ing ongoing activities, or guiding the observer’s attention. Artists {{have found ways to}} visualize physical as well as nonphysical dynamics of scenes using graph-ics techniques. In a sense, we can consider these smart depictions—a form of expressive, visual content adopting the styles of visual art and abstraction techniques. These depictions can serve, for example, as pictograms and signs that advise and assist people. They’re also pre-sent in comic books and story...|$|R
5000|$|The main {{difference}} from other photographic forms like light painting or light writing is {{the inclusion of}} the background in the photo. Location selection is a very important aspect of these <b>projects,</b> because the <b>scenery</b> of the landscape or buildings, such as industrial ruins, often have to be researched. Every composition needs its own background. LED-lamps are often used. Playing with cold and warm light opens the possibility to emphasize different structures. Often more than one person is involved in a work of. One person creates the light figures and structures while the other person operates the camera.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{prolonged}} exposure to foveal defocus {{is well known}} to affect the visual functions in the fovea. However, the effects of peripheral blur adaptation on foveal vision, or vice versa, are still unclear. In this study, we therefore examined the changes in contrast sensitivity function from baseline, following blur adaptation to small as well as laterally extended stimuli in four subjects. The small field stimulus (7. 5 ° visual field) was a 30 min video of forest <b>scenery</b> <b>projected</b> on a screen and the large field stimulus consisted of 7 -tiles of the 7. 5 ° stimulus stacked horizontally. Both stimuli were used for adaptation with optical blur (+ 2. 00 D trial lens) {{as well as for}} clear control conditions. After small field blur adaptation foveal contrast sensitivity improved in the mid spatial frequency region. However, these changes neither spread to the periphery nor occurred for the large field blur adaptation. To conclude, visual performance after adaptation is dependent on the lateral extent of the adaptation stimulus...|$|R
40|$|One {{of popular}} trend {{converting}} detention pond of Soil and Water Conservation <b>Project</b> to having <b>scenery</b> or irrigation purpose {{had been found}} in forest park, agricultural plantation, ecological park, or other parks for recreation. The thematic values on ecology were thus recognized and without any adverse effects on flood prevention which originated from legal permits of Soil and Water Conservation Law had been complained. Even so, we need objective data to evaluate the strength and weakness on such conversion and evaluate the state-of-art. This research, therefore, performed observation of the arresting animals in detention pond located in No. 8 hole boundary in National Garden Golf Course. Hope such kind of data can be apply for improving the management and usage of detention pond and benefiting the plan and design in construction of detention ponds. The arresting animals in this research were divided into four categories according to the relation between their lies and pond. The first category is the animals had a direct lie, including lies located inside water, bonding lands, or banks. The secondary category is the animals of near-by lies such in perches surrounding the ponds. The third category is those animals regarded pond as creative places. The forth category is those animals selected their home way or travel tracks if passing the pond. Due to not much enough arresting animal samples had been observed during the night, the technical improvement seems required. The concluding results feedback at least three points for a better design of detention pond in situ. The freeboard may need to follow the habit of Anas Plaryrhynchos. The location of the existing spring in the pool was not suitable to the effect of wind on the topography and, thus, harmful to customers, or arresting animal's activities. The last one explained the close interaction between business and animal habit. 水土保持計畫內的滯洪池完工後，在林場、農場、生態園或休閒園區轉變兼具景觀或灌溉池使用的狀況十分普遍。此種改變利用有利生態主題價值，並不阻礙水土保持法賦于滯洪功能效果之報導。雖然如此，我們仍然須要客觀資料以供評估現況與供評估這種轉變的優點與缺點。因此本文選定全國高爾夫球場八號洞池醒目動物的觀察分析為研究，希望能改善滯洪池之管理與使用。並進一步作為改善滯洪池之規劃與設計。 本案例將醒目動物分成四種。其一是以水池為直接棲地，包括以水中、浮島或池岸為家的動物。其二是鄰近棲地，如水池旁棲木上的動物。其三是視水池為休閒地，前來玩水、飲水與結伴社交活動的動物。其四是以水池為其回家或旅行所經路徑的動物。 高爾夫球場草皮經營極為精緻，滯洪池營養條件並不豐富。加上滯洪池附近生物可能受到干擾狀況嚴重，在不干擾球場運作的條件下僅進行醒目的動物觀察。白天共發現九種，夜間僅有一種。 由本案例之成果至少有三點可直接反饋本滯洪池之改進。其一是綠頭鴨晴天最後一次飲水是佇立在池邊飲水，水池滯水位離岸高不得超過綠頭鴨身長，才是綠頭鴨選擇棲息在 8 號洞滯洪池的原因。其二是在＃ 8 洞滯洪池現有地形與天候變化條件下，喷水柱的位置會干擾到動物的活動。其三是球場球客早晨 5 : 00 入場，正是綠頭鴨早上出門時，營業影響動物習性十分明顯。誌謝	I 摘要	II ABSTRACT	IV 目錄	V 圖目錄	VI 照片目錄	VII 一、前 言 (Introduction) 	 1 二、生態滯洪池在水土保持法的地位	 5 三、研究方法與材料	 12 四、結果與討論	 17 五、結論與建議	 23 六、參考資料 (References) 	 2...|$|R
