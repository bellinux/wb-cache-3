40|$|Benchmarking in Design Projects: Lessons Learned from a Sophomore Design Course This paper {{presents}} some of {{the lessons}} learned from a sophomore design course offered {{at one of the}} major universities in the United States. This course is developed to provide realistic design, machining and mechatronics experiences to mechanical engineering sophomores. As apart of this course, the students are required to generate ideas for solving a real-life design problem. The objective {{of this study is to}} identify the influences of <b>benchmarking</b> <b>products</b> on the final concepts generated by student designers. Literature shows that designers, while solving open-ended design problems, tend to copy features from any examples available to them, a phenomenon known as “design fixation. ” This paper studies the <b>benchmarking</b> <b>products</b> and their effect on student-generated designs for a cake transportation problem. The challenge is to devise a method to safely transport large cakes from a bakery to the location of their final use. The design process includes customer needs understanding, researching on existing designs,quality function deployment, functional decomposition, concept generation and the selection of a final design. At the end of the project, the students are required to present a final design and four alternate feasible concepts. Students work on this project as teams of three or four. For this particular design problem, there is a finite set of existing products that the students can <b>benchmark</b> and these <b>products</b> possess their own disadvantages, necessitating a new design. For the purpose of this study, the final reports from 50 design teams are collected and analyzed for the presence of features from the <b>benchmarking</b> <b>products.</b> The working principles of the concepts are identified and then they are broken down to the level of individual features. These principles and features are compared against those from the <b>benchmarking</b> <b>products.</b> It is observed that while many teams identified and used the abstract working principles of the <b>benchmarking</b> <b>products,</b> many of them also copied the surface features in their designs. While fixation to the abstract working principles of the <b>benchmarking</b> <b>products</b> can lead to working designs, it hinders the generation of alternate design concepts. In many cases, students restricted their solutions to the variations of the <b>benchmarking</b> <b>products</b> instead of exploring the solution-space any further. The fixation to surface features often leads to unnecessary design features in the final concepts,which may lead to added cost for the product. This shows that current engineering design curricula needs to provide additional guidance to students so that they can avoid fixation to those products. The paper also summarizes some suggestions to teach design courses while avoiding fixation to the <b>benchmarking</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R

The impact of feedback quality on the performance of maintenance tasks at the level of handling individual parts was measured and analysed. Remote execution of the maintenance actions took roughly 3 - 5 times more time than hands-on. Visual feedback was identified as the dominant factor, including aspects like (lack of) operator control over camera placement, pan, tilt and zoom, lack of 3 D perception, image quality, and latency. Haptic feedback was found to be important, but only in specific contact transition and constrained motion tasks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a two-step method useful for support of <b>product</b> <b>benchmarking</b> {{practice}} in the automotive industry by measuring a technical value of car model. This method assumes that a car is a bundle of objectively and subjectively measurable attributes (i. e. functional features) provided to users. The car’s technical value is thus a measure of the overall benefit it delivers to users, while the car’s technical efficiency measures a relative benefit the users gain when they utilize a particular car model charged by certain ownership and usage costs. Technical efficiency is calculated by implementing Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). As an example, the method is implemented to conduct a retrospective benchmarking study in the Italian domestic passenger car market in the years 1970 s- 1990 s. Results show that cars differed remarkably due to their technical efficiency, but only 35 car models in the sample have been classified by DEA as 100 % efficient. Car models sold in the 1980 s resulted not so competitive in terms of technical efficiency as models sold in the 1970 s and 1990 s. The results also revealed that the technical value increases with the purchasing cost, but it diminishes with the usage cost. As additional value to literature and practice, the method suggests insights about how: a) to compare cars in a multi-dimension features space; b) to analyze technological trends in the car industry; c) to study the car market structure and identify the emergence of market niches still unexploited by automotive manufacturers...|$|R
40|$|The {{drying process}} of paper has many {{production}} parameters that can influence both the energy consumed and {{the characteristics of}} paper produced. It was found {{that most of the}} previous studies conducted on this process assume that the conditions of the facilities are always appropriate. The control of the variables associated with air circulating inside the drying hood is essential to obtain a paper with adequate quality and obtain low ratios of energy consumption and CO 2 emissions. This article proposes a new indirect method based on the study of the enthalpy of the airflows inside the production hall and thermographic images that helps to analyze the maintenance state of the enclosure hood drying section in a general process, whereby it can also estimate the emissions and energy losses. The combined use of sensors and equipment has helped to identify energy losses and potential savings in CO 2 emissions.

40|$|Our rapid {{prototype}} of damaged systems project seeks {{to provide a}} technology for allowing engineers to build demonstration prototypes of damaged products from analysis post-processing data. Most commercial finite element programs {{do not have a}} capability to construct deformed geometry at the conclusion of an analysis simulation. It is therefore not presently possible to build prototypes of predicted states of a product as the result of being subjected to simulated adverse environments. Our approach is to reverse engineer a description of a deformed finite element mesh into a stereolithography format for prototyping using a Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) machine. This stereolithography file can be generated from deformed surface node information as well as from a reconstructed surface defined by inspection data. We are developing software to allow users to represent a part or assembly in a deformed condition.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a {{technical}} review of a new Bernoulli gripper development using computed fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, and also to outline an appropriate independent testing method for validating and evaluating process capability in terms of automated thin wafer handling. The investigation has been carried out by a collaborative way of Festo and Fraunhofer IPA as a connecting link between applied research and industrial needs. Design/methodology/approach - Following an introduction, the paper first describes the basic development and fundamental principles of a gripper based on Bernoulli's law. The gripper was dimensioned and designed with the aid of CFD methods. The performance of the hardware was tested using extreme parameter settings while gripping thin, fragile workpieces. The performance of the gripper was tested from the aspects of shortest cycle times, positioning accuracy and air consumption and followed a manufacturer-independent design of experiments. A characterization of the gripping force generated during horizontal and vertical tension tests provides conclusive closed loop validation with regard to the gripper's air flow in the initial CFD model. Findings - Photovoltaic (PV) grippers are challenging components since the handling objects, 200 - 120 µmm thin crystalline silicon wafers with an area of 156 × 156 mm, are one of the most fragile parts as far as required handling speeds and cycle times are concerned.
