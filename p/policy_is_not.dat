In {{assessing}} whether policies fall foul of this rule, a court cannot {{reject the}} way in which an administrative body formulated a policy in favour of its own view of how the discretion should have been exercised. Furthermore, a <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> Wednesbury-unreasonable if the court simply feels that it may not work effectively.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma President David Boren wrote {{a letter}} to Big12 {{commissioner}} Kevin Weiberg asking for the loss to be erased from Oklahoma's record, something that Weiberg did not support. Weiberg did say that he would raise concerns about the Pac-10 policy of using their own officials for inter-conference games in Pac-10 stadiums. Bob Stoops said that he may cancel the 2008 game scheduled at Washington if the Pac-10 officiating <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> changed.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem of}} {{politics}} over economics. The making {{and implementation of}} <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> one of discovery, but rather of top down implementation. Rigid state control will limit how a society can respond to tensions and crisis, and thus politics creates its own presuppositions and limits creativity and alternative solutions.|$|E
25|$|The vessel {{size and}} gear types of the U.S. fishing fleet varies {{geographically}} and between fisheries. Because of this, management of U.S. fisheries {{with a single}} <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> feasible. Individual fisheries have their own biological, economic, and sociological characteristics which make broad policies impractical. On the other hand, ad hoc regulations for individual fisheries is not practical either.|$|E

25|$|The {{policy toward}} {{refugees}} from North Korea is a recurring human rights issue. It is official policy to repatriate these refugees to North Korea, but the <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> evenly enforced and {{a considerable number}} of them stay in the People's Republic. Though it is in contravention of international law to deport political refugees, as illegal immigrants their situation is precarious. Their rights are not always protected, and some are tricked into marriage or prostitution.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been argued that the one-child <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{effective}} enough to justify its costs, and that external factors caused a dramatic decrease in Chinese fertility rates to begin even before 1979. The policy {{seems to have had}} little impact on rural areas (home to about 80% of the population), where birth rates never dropped below 2.5 children per female. Nevertheless, the Chinese government and others estimate that at least 250million births have been prevented by the policy.|$|E
25|$|When a court protects an applicant's {{substantive}} legitimate expectation, it {{is effectively}} mandating {{the outcome of}} a public body's decision-making process. One criticism is that this undesirably fetters the body's discretion as it will {{no longer be able to}} formulate policy without constraints. Nevertheless, it has been acknowledged that protecting substantive legitimate expectations ensures good administration. Consistency and fairness are reinforced in decision-making processes where the administrative power to alter <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> used to unduly frustrate legitimate expectations. Furthermore, when a public body acts contrary to what it had induced an individual to expect, it may cause that individual severe hardship, especially if he or she relied on the representation and there is no satisfactory alternative to the substance of the promise. The problem is alleviated if the court orders that the individual's legitimate expectation be given effect.|$|E

Aside from the demoralizing effect on the world at large and the possibilities of disturbances arising {{as a result of the}} desperation of the people concerned, the consequences to the economy of the United States should be apparent to all. It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health to the world, without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace. Our <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> directed against any country, but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos.
