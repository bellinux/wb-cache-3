2500|$|Later in the 20th century, H. L. A. Hart {{attacked}} Austin for his simplifications and Kelsen for his fictions in The Concept of Law. Hart argued law is {{a system}} of rules, divided into <b>primary</b> (<b>rules</b> of conduct) and secondary ones (rules addressed to officials to administer <b>primary</b> <b>rules).</b> Secondary rules are further divided into rules of adjudication (to resolve legal disputes), rules of change (allowing laws to be varied) {{and the rule of}} recognition (allowing laws to be identified as valid). Two of Hart's students continued the debate: In his book Law's Empire, Ronald Dworkin attacked Hart and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue. Dworkin argues that {{law is a}}n [...] "interpretive concept", that requires judges to find the best fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions. Joseph Raz, on the other hand, defended the positivist outlook and criticised Hart's [...] "soft social thesis" [...] approach in The Authority of Law. Raz argues that law is authority, identifiable purely through social sources and without reference to moral reasoning. In his view, any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authoritative instruments in mediation are best left to sociology, rather than jurisprudence.|$|E

Architecture is an art for all men to learn, because all are {{concerned}} with it; and it is so simple, that there is no excuse for not being acquainted with its <b>primary</b> <b>rules,</b> any more than for ignorance of grammar or of spelling, which are both of them far more difficult sciences. Far less trouble than is necessary to learn how to play chess, or whist, or golf, tolerably,--far less than a school-boy takes to win the meanest prize of the passing year, would acquaint you with all the main principles of the construction of a Gothic cathedral, and I believe you would hardly find the study less amusing. But be that as it may, there are one or two broad principles which need only be stated to be understood and accepted; and those I mean to lay before you, with your permission, before you leave this room.|$|E

500|$|The {{alternate}} approach taken is the [...] "beneficiary election" [...] approach. This is {{that where}} trust funds are wrongly mixed with the trustee's personal funds, used for an investment, and the money is thus not recoverable, the beneficiaries are allowed to [...] "elect" [...] whether the investment is to be held as a security for the amounts owed to them, or whether to take the unauthorised investment {{as part of the}} trust fund. This is considered the exception, rather than the rule; in Foskett v McKeown, Millett said that [...] "The <b>primary</b> <b>rule</b> in regard to a mixed fund, therefore, is that gains and losses are borne by the contributors rateably. The beneficiary's right to elect instead to enforce a lien to obtain repayment is an exception to the <b>primary</b> <b>rule,</b> exercisable where the fund is deficient and the claim is made against the wrongdoer and those claiming through him".|$|R

40|$|Inspired by a modular way of reasoning, {{we present}} a subsethood-product fuzzy neural {{classifier}} with a novel, robust and dynamic architecture, involving a main module {{and a number of}} submodules. The well-known classification and regression trees (CART) algorithm is employed as a fast preprocess of structure identification, which divides the input space into high certainty and low certainty regions, each representing a <b>primary</b> fuzzy <b>rule.</b> These <b>primary</b> fuzzy <b>rules</b> use a minimum set of attributes and are mapped onto the main neuro-fuzzy module. However, the patterns belonging to a low certainty <b>primary</b> <b>rule</b> get further split into a subset of secondary rules that use an extended set of attributes. Each such rule subset is mapped onto an expert-submodule, which gets activated only when a pattern falls into the respective low certainty region. In other words, we create a rule form of ""if-then-if"" conditional statement, where the first ""IF"" concerns the main module and the <b>primary</b> <b>rule,</b> while the second ""IF"" concerns the respective submodule and the secondary rule set. This dynamic resource-allocating model is optimized through a supervised learning procedure. Experiments in benchmark classification tasks prove that this architecture not only does reduce complexity and computational cost, which is its primary goal, but also offers fast and accurate processing during real-time operation. Moreover, it holds certain properties that make it ideal for soft computing applications of high dimension, especially those that adopt user-profiles or require partial re-training. © 2007 Elsevier B.

50|$|The Rowing Association of American Colleges (1870 to 1894) was {{the first}} collegiate {{athletic}} organization in the United States.

5000|$|But {{laws are}} more than rules of conduct. Laws can be divided up into two sorts: <b>primary</b> <b>rules</b> (rules of conduct) and {{secondary}} rules (rules addressed to officials and which set out to affect the operation of <b>primary</b> <b>rules).</b> Secondary rules deal with three problems: first the problem of uncertainty about what the law is (the secondary rule for this dilemma is called the rule of recognition and states the criteria of validity of a law), second the problem of rigidity of rules (which requires rules of change allowing laws to be varied), and third {{the problem of how}} to resolve legal disputes (from which rules of adjudication arise).

5000|$|Rules, said Hart, {{are divided}} into <b>primary</b> <b>rules</b> (rules of conduct) and {{secondary}} rules (rules addressed to officials to administer <b>primary</b> <b>rules).</b> Secondary rules {{are divided into}} rules of adjudication (to resolve legal disputes), rules of change (allowing laws to be varied) {{and the rule of}} recognition (allowing laws to be identified as valid). The [...] "rule of recognition" [...] is a customary practice of the officials (especially barristers and judges) that identifies certain acts and decisions as sources of law. A pivotal book on Hart was written by Neil MacCormick in 1981 (second edition due in 2007), which further refined and offered some important criticisms that led MacCormick to develop his own theory (the best example of which is his recently published Institutions of Law, 2007). Other important critiques have included that of Ronald Dworkin, John Finnis, and Joseph Raz.|$|E

Hart claimed the concept of rule of recognition as an evolution from Hans Kelsen's [...] "Grundnorm", or [...] "basic norm".|$|E

The moral character of the norm may encourage the sense that following it is an imperative rather than a choice, and failing to reciprocate should create feelings of self-reproach and guilt.|$|R
