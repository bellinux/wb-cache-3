5|$|As {{a result}} of a tidal shock, streams of stars can be <b>pulled</b> <b>away</b> from the cluster halo, leaving only the core part of the cluster. These tidal {{interaction}} effects create tails of stars that can extend up to several degrees of arc away from the cluster. These tails typically both precede and follow the cluster along its orbit. The tails can accumulate significant portions of the original mass of the cluster, and can form clumplike features.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Tropical Storm Cristobal, {{a tropical storm}} warning was issued for coastal areas from the South Santee River in South Carolina to the North Carolina–Virginia Border.

National Weather Service forecasters advised against swimming due to high seas and potential rip currents. Environment Canada issued rain warnings throughout portions of Nova Scotia.|$|E

5|$|Audi's No. 7 car of André Lotterer, Marcel Fässler and Benoît Tréluyer won {{the pole}} {{position}} and maintained their advantage on the race's first lap. Lotterer initially <b>pulled</b> <b>away</b> {{from the field}} but lost the lead to Mark Webber in Porsche's No. 1 car who remained in the position. Co-driver Brendon Hartley remained in first until he retired following heavy contact with Michael Wainwright in the No. 86 Gulf Racing car. This handed the lead to Neel Jani in the sister No. 2 car, but it switched again to Tréluyer when Jani's co-driver Marc Lieb was delayed by a slower vehicle. Although he was challenged by Lieb after being blocked by slower cars Tréluyer <b>pulled</b> <b>away</b> from him and the No. 7 Audi maintained its advantage over the No. 2 Porsche {{for the majority of}} the remainder of the event to finish the race first. However the No. 7 Audi was disqualified when scrutineers discovered that its front skid block was worn out by more than the regulations allowed for, handing the victory to Lieb, Jani and Romain Dumas. Toyota No. 5 drivers Stéphane Sarrazin, Mike Conway and Kamui Kobayashi finished in second and Dominik Kraihamer, Alexandre Imperatori and Mathéo Tuscher came in third to secure Rebellion Racing's first podium in the series since 2013.|$|E

5|$|However, Glasgow was now {{exposed to}} fire from three ships, so Howe decided to break off the battle, {{in order to avoid}} being boarded, and made sail for Newport. Despite {{extensive}} damage to the sail and rigging, he <b>pulled</b> <b>away</b> from the pursuing fleet, which was fully laden with its captured goods. Hopkins called off the chase after several hours in order to avoid an encounter with the British squadron at Newport. His only prize was Glasgow tender, which the fleet brought to anchor in New London, Connecticut on April 8.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to the}} Final Four in San Antonio, UConn {{dominated}} {{teams from}} Southern, Temple, Iowa State and Florida State.

5|$|More complex {{parts are}} formed using more complex moulds. These may have {{sections}} called slides, that {{move into a}} cavity perpendicular to the draw direction, to form overhanging part features. When the mould is opened, the slides are <b>pulled</b> <b>away</b> from the plastic part by using stationary “angle pins” on the stationary mould half. These pins enter a slot in the slides and cause the slides to move backward when the moving half of the mould opens. The part is then ejected and the mould closes. The closing action of the mould causes the slides to move forward along the angle pins.|$|E
5|$|On {{his first}} start after the Derby, St. Gatien was sent to Royal Ascot for the Gold Vase, in which he faced the top class older horses Corrie Roy (who started favourite) and Tristan at {{weight-for-age}} over two miles. Corrie Roy made the running until the straight, when Wood moved St. Gatien up to challenge. The Derby winner quickly {{took control of the}} race and <b>pulled</b> <b>away</b> to win easily by four lengths from Corrie Roy, with Tristan a remote third. Later at the same meeting Corrie Roy won the Alexandra Plate, while Tristan beat Harvester in the Hardwicke Stakes.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{were just}} 1½ games behind the Toronto Blue Jays when they {{acquired}} Lee Smith, and he pitched nearly perfectly {{for the last}} month of the season. In eight games, Smith did not allow a single run and picked up three saves and 11 strikeouts. The Yankees as a team, however, did poorly during {{the remainder of the}} season, and Toronto easily <b>pulled</b> <b>away</b> to win the division. Smith's New York career lasted just those eight games as he filed for free agency after the season. He signed with Baltimore for 1994 for $1.5 million plus incentives.|$|E

5|$|The {{incident}} allowed Jani to {{move into}} the lead but di Grassi stopped at Farm Curve with a motor generator unit problem shortly afterwards. His team's mechanics were allowed to tend to the Audi after travelling via a course car, extending the full course yellow as it was tended to. Di Grassi's race ended prematurely and one of the mechanics used a fire extinguisher to extinguish smoke bellowing from his car. The race resumed after 23 minutes with Tréluyer attacking Lieb, and upon being delayed by the No. 13 Rebellion Racing car, passed him {{to move into}} the lead on the approach to Maggots corner and <b>pulled</b> <b>away</b> on the Hangar straight. Rast stopped at the entrance of Maggots corner with a fuel pump pressure failure, causing him to lose the LMP2 lead to Watts and rejoined the field in third place in class. Rast recovered and passed Senna for second in LMP2 by using the grass at Stowe corner. Tréluyer was blocked by slower traffic allowing Lieb to close up to him on the Wellington straight. Lieb could not overtake because he was delayed by a pack of LMP2 cars. Rast closed up to Watts and overtook him to retake the LMP2 lead. Tréluyer and Lieb ran closely between each other before the former <b>pulled</b> <b>away</b> from Lieb.|$|E
5|$|The tournament {{began on}} Saturday, May 9, when the Brown Bears {{traveled}} {{to face the}} eighth-seeded Johns Hopkins Blue Jays at Homewood Field in Baltimore.

In the final ten seconds of regulation, Brown attackman Kyle Hollingsworth batted in a loose ball to even the score, 11–11. In overtime, Hopkins won the faceoff and called a timeout, before Brian Christopher drove up {{the right side of the}} field and made a game-winning top-corner shot on the run. It was the third overtime goal by Christopher in Hopkins' past four games.|$|E
5|$|A {{cannonball}} {{from the}} second French broadside struck Corbet within minutes of the first broadside, the ball tearing off his foot above the ankle just as a large wooden splinter thrown from the gunwale struck the thigh of the same leg, shattering the bone. Corbet was brought below to the ship's surgeon where the remnant of his leg was hastily amputated and bound, and command devolved on Lieutenant John Crew Tullidge. At 02:30, Astrée <b>pulled</b> <b>away</b> from Africaine to perform hasty repairs, but Bouvet's guns had wrecked Africaines rigging, leaving the British frigate uncontrollable and largely immobile. Slowly moving ahead, Africaine engaged Iphigénie at close range but was counter attacked by Astrée and found herself assailed on both sides, Astrée angled in such a position {{that she was able}} to rake the British ship, inflicting significant damage and casualties.|$|E

5|$|Although Vettel and Alonso {{were on the}} grids' front row, both {{drivers were}} passed by Massa {{at the start of}} the race. Alonso and Massa traded the fastest times in the first twelve laps of the race until the pit stop period. Massa {{struggled}} with tyre temperatures and was challenged by Alonso on the 21st lap but fended off his efforts to move into the lead. Massa <b>pulled</b> <b>away</b> slightly from Alonso until the former came across slower cars which reduced the time deficit between them. Alonso took over the first position after Massa was issued with team orders by Ferrari which Alonso to pass him. Massa resisted pressure from Vettel while Alonso maintained the lead throughout the remainder of the race and clinched the 23rd victory of his career.|$|E
5|$|Brooks then {{executed}} a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost {{even with his}} Soviet counterpart Kopliakov. He had drawn level halfway through his leg and made a superior turn {{to take the lead}} as they headed home. The Soviet freestyler pulled level with 25m to go before Brooks again <b>pulled</b> <b>away</b> to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. He did not breathe in the last ten metres, and claimed to be laughing for the final five metres, confident that his opponent could not pass him. Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86s as he had vowed to his team mates. In doing so, he recorded the swiftest freestyle split in the relay, faster than that of the individual 100m freestyle gold medallist, Jörg Woithe of East Germany.|$|E
