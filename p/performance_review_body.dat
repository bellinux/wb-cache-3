40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{describe}} the opportunities and challenges of a curricular review process in an entry-level doctor of physical therapy geriatric curriculum. The curricular review process utilized an external interprofessional <b>reviewing</b> <b>body,</b> in conjunction with an established internal curricular <b>reviewing</b> <b>body,</b> to determine inclusion of Essential Competencies in order to prepare students for best clinical practice in the care of the older adult. Method: The methodology of our curricular review process included both internal and external <b>reviewing</b> <b>bodies</b> but the intent of this article is to highlight how the review process was implemented including an external interprofessional <b>reviewing</b> <b>body.</b> The internal <b>reviewing</b> <b>body</b> involved two faculty members with expertise in geriatrics, the Program Curriculum Committee members, and the faculty members within the entry-level doctor of physical therapy program. The external <b>reviewing</b> <b>body</b> was comprised of the 2012 - 2014 members of the Faculty Development Collaborative Program in Geriatrics (FDCPG), a national interprofessional learning community representing multiple disciplines involved in the care of older adults. Results: The outcomes of including an external interprofessional <b>reviewing</b> <b>body</b> in the geriatric curricular review process were: the FDCPG justified the need for the review of the Essential Competencies, deemed their role as important in healthcare education, and reported a greater understanding of the role of physical therapists as part of an interprofessional healthcare team. The Program Curriculum Committee created a policy for consideration of other published competencies, including a recommendation for “other necessary consultation” based on our use of an external <b>reviewing</b> <b>body,</b> noting its value. The outcomes of the overall curricular review process included: 53 / 61 Essential Competencies were identified as already in the curriculum and the remaining 8 / 61 Essential Competencies were added. Conclusions and Recommendations: The addition of an external interprofessional <b>reviewing</b> <b>body</b> to an already established internal <b>reviewing</b> <b>body</b> within the geriatric curricular review process in an entry-level doctor of physical therapy program produced a curriculum that will hopefully prepare students for best clinical practice in the care of the older adult. This comprehensive curricular review process involved opportunities and challenges yet still can be used across multiple disciplines, across multiple curricular structures, and is in line with the current state of healthcare practice...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{examining}} if the management, the managers and the employees {{have a different}} point of view regarding the purpose and the expectations of a <b>performance</b> <b>review.</b> Additionally it is an assignment from the Swedish company Flexlink AB with the purpose of constructing a new template for their <b>performance</b> <b>reviews.</b> The assumption is that if you manage to create one template for <b>performance</b> <b>reviews</b> that meets the expectations at all levels of the organization, it will contribute to create a meaningful <b>performance</b> <b>review.</b> We decided to study this from an organizational cultural perspective, since the organizational culture plays a significant part in <b>performance</b> <b>reviews.</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>reviews</b> are systematic conversations between employees and managers related to planning, information exchange and developing the relationship. Previous research indicates that if employees are satisfied with their <b>performance</b> <b>reviews,</b> they prone to be more satisfied with their work situation and have a higher organizational commitment. The study was done through interviews with three participants from the management team, five managers at various levels as well as five employees, all from Flexlink. The questions concerned their perception of the purpose and expectations for the <b>performance</b> <b>reviews</b> in general and also their perception of the existing template. The responses were then analyzed using previous research about <b>performance</b> <b>reviews</b> and theories of organizational culture. The management concluded that the purpose of a <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> is to reconcile the company's development with the individual´s, and to ensure the organizational competence needs. Employees believe that the purpose of a <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> is to discuss their work situation. Both the management's and the employee´s expectations of the <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> are that it will provide valuable feedback for both sides which indicate a low degree of power distance from an organizational culture perspective. The managers believe that the purpose is to reconcile the past year and plan for the future year. They are expecting an open and honest discussion with potential for constructive criticism, which also supports the indication of a low degree of power distance. With the basis in the analysis of the interviews and previous research on the subject a new template was constructed...|$|R

40|$|A <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> {{program is}} a {{management}} tool for enhancing the performance of employees. Such systems have been widely adopted by {{both private and public}} organisations during the last decade. Management writers strongly advocate the involvement of senior managers in <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> programs. In order to investigate the extent to which senior managers within public hospitals in New South Wales are presently involved in such programs, a survey was conducted. The aims of the survey were: to determine the number of senior hospital managers currently participating in a <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> program; to investigate the methodologies being used within hospitals to evaluate the performance of senior managers; to examine the reasons why hospitals with a formal <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> program in place had implemented that system; and to ascertain the reasons why some hospitals had failed to establish a formal <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> system for senior managers. The most frequently used methodology employed was based on the management-by-objectives model. The findings indicate that further education of those who influence the management of hospitals regarding the benefits of involving senior executives in <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> programs is necessary. 13 page(s...|$|R
