25|$|A biscuit joiner (or {{sometimes}} <b>plate</b> <b>joiner)</b> is a {{woodworking tool}} used to join {{two pieces of}} wood together. A biscuit joiner uses a small circular saw blade to cut a crescent-shaped hole (called the mouth) in the opposite edges of two pieces of wood or wood composite panels. An oval-shaped, highly dried and compressed wooden biscuit (beech or particle wood) is covered with glue, or glue is applied in the slot. The biscuit is immediately placed in the slot, and the two boards are clamped together. The wet glue expands the biscuit, further improving the bond.|$|E

He invented {{a system in}} 1956 that he called the Lamello Joining System which {{is now known as}} the biscuit joiner or <b>plate</b> <b>joiner.</b> He also produced the first portable <b>plate</b> <b>joiner</b> in the late 1960s. In 1969, his family operation was incorporated under the name Lamello AG.|$|E

25|$|For most {{portable}} <b>plate</b> <b>joiners,</b> {{a nominal}} 4 inch or 100mm diameter blade {{is used for}} the #0, #10, #20 biscuit cuts. The blade is set deeper for joining the larger biscuits. Most blades have 4, 6, or 8 teeth and fit a 7/8 inch or 22mm arbor. The thickness of the blade is typically 0.156 to 0.160 inch or nominally 4mm.|$|R
