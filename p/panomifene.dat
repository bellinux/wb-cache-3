50|$|<b>Panomifene</b> (INN) (former {{developmental}} code names GYKI-13504, EGIS-5650) is a nonsteroidal selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) of the triphenylethylene group {{related to}} tamoxifen that was under development as an antineoplastic agent by Egis Pharmaceuticals and IVAX Drug Research Institute in the 1990s {{for the treatment}} of breast cancer but was not marketed. It reached phase II clinical trials before development was terminated. The drug was described in 1981.|$|E
50|$|TPE is {{the parent}} {{compound}} {{of a group}} of nonsteroidal estrogen receptor ligands. It includes the estrogens chlorotrianisene, estrobin (DBE), triphenylbromoethylene, triphenylchloroethylene, triphenyliodoethylene, triphenylmethylethylene; the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) afimoxifene, brilanestrant, broparestrol, clomifene, clomifenoxide, droloxifene, endoxifen, etacstil, fispemifene, idoxifene, miproxifene, miproxifene phosphate, nafoxidine, ospemifene, <b>panomifene,</b> and toremifene. The antiestrogen ethamoxytriphetol (MER-25) is also closely related, but is technically not a derivative of TPE and is instead a triphenylethanol derivative. The tamoxifen metabolite and aromatase inhibitor norendoxifen is also a TPE derivative. In addition to their estrogenic activity, various TPE derivatives like tamoxifen and clomifene have been found to act as protein kinase C inhibitors.|$|E
40|$|In vitro {{metabolism}} of <b>panomifene</b> (E- 1, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -[4 -(2 -(2 -hy-droxyethyl-amino) -ethoxy) -phenyl]- 3, 3, 3 -trifluoropropene), a novel antiestrogen against hormone dependent tumors, {{has been}} inves-tigated using liver microsomes from mouse, rat, dog, and human. Hydroxylation and side chain modifications were the routes of <b>panomifene</b> metabolism. Microsomal biotransformation showed some qualitative similarities, but several differences were ob-served in the metabolic {{profiles of the}} four species tested. Seven metabolites were detected in the incubation mixtures analyzed by thin layer chromatography and autoradiography, although {{there was only one}} produced by all species that had lost the side chain. Among the side chain shortened metabolites, the compound that had lost the hydroxyethyl-amino group was formed by the micro-somal system of rodents, whereas the one that had lost the hy-droxyethyl group was detected in the incubation mixtures with rat...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} well known that triphenylethylene {{derivatives}} such as tamoxifen, droloxifene, toremifene and <b>panomifene</b> are very useful selective estrogen receptor modulators to prevent bone loss and breast cancer. 1 The triphenylvinyl moiety {{is a very important}} framework in these types of analogs. Among the triphenylvinyl moieties, β,β-bis(4 '-methoxy) phenyl-α-phenylvinyl moiety is of particular im-portant because a metabolite of tamoxifen formed in patients is 1 -(4 '-hydroxy) phenyl- 1 -(4 '-dimethylaminoethoxy) phenyl- 2 -phenyl- 1 -butene 2 which binds to estrogen receptor much more effectively than tamoxifen. 3 Therefore, a variety of easy transformations of functionality on vinyl carbon with keeping the β,β-bis(4 '-methoxy) phenyl-α-phenylvinyl moiety is a quite important synthetic target for the synthesis of vari-ous relevant compounds. Generally, most of triphenylethyl...|$|E
