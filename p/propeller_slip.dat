40|$|Force {{measurements}} giving total thrust and torque, and <b>propeller</b> <b>slip</b> stream surveys giving differential thrust and torque were simultaneously made {{on each of}} six full-scale propellers in the 20 -foot propeller-research {{tunnel of}} the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. They were adjustable-pitch metal propellers 9. 5 feet in diameter; three had modified Clark Y blade sections and three had modified RAF- 6 blade sections. This report gives the differential thrust and torque and the variation caused by changing the propeller tip speed and the pitch setting. The total thrust and torque obtained from integration of the thrust and torque distribution curves are compared with those obtained by direct force measurements...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{analyses}} of many complex variables, which θp(deg.) is propeller pitch angle; Np(rpm), revolution of propeller; V(kt), ship speed; G(kg/h), fuel oil consumption; Ne(ps), shaft horse power and S(%), <b>propeller</b> <b>slip,</b> based on the service performance of Engine Log-Books of T/V Kakuyo-Maru, Faculty of Fisheries, Nagasaki University, from 1999 to 2001. Following results were obtained. 1) V 3 /G, fuel oil consumption coefficient was expressed by the following experimental formulae, where H(day) is running hour of main engine. 1999 ：V 3 /G= 15. 2662 H－ 0. 1602 2000 ：V 3 /G= 11. 8225 H－ 0. 0870 2) Due to advancing of the marine fouling animals of the hull bottom and the propeller blades, the propulsive coefficient ηpc (%) have been deteriorated, since SM increases large up and the presumptive G increases up until 40 ～ 50 % {{at the end of}} year. We should select the most economic operation modes corresponding to the reduction of CO 2 emission which is discharged under various operating conditions of the propulsive plant of the vessel...|$|E
50|$|The film's final scenes include {{details from}} the {{novel of the}} Poseidons sinking that {{were not part of}} the 1972 film adaptation. The final shot was from the air as the ship's <b>propellers</b> <b>slipped</b> beneath the surface, which, by design or coincidence, matches several {{photographs}} taken by a news plane of the final moments of the SS Andrea Doria in 1956.|$|R
50|$|In {{larger and}} more modern engines, a rubber bushing transmits the torque of the drive shaft to the propeller's hub. Under a {{damaging}} load the friction of the bushing in the hub is overcome and the rotating <b>propeller</b> <b>slips</b> on the shaft, preventing overloading of the engine's components. After such an event the rubber bushing may be damaged. If so, it may continue to transmit reduced power at low revolutions, but may provide no power, due to reduced friction, at high revolutions. Also, the rubber bushing may perish over time leading to its failure under loads below its designed failure load.|$|R
5000|$|The Starliner was {{the first}} totally new Vega Airplane Company aircraft. It made its maiden flight at Burbank on April 22, 1939, with Vern Dorrell as pilot and J.B. Kendrick as {{engineering}} observer. This first flight, however, ended with an emergency when the <b>propeller</b> accidentally <b>slipped</b> into fine pitch. Vern Dorrell succeeded in landing on a vacant field, with minimum damage to the aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Permanent {{four-wheel drive}} pickups {{featured}} a two-speed dual range New Process 203 transfer case with planetary center differential and lock. Five drive modes were provided: High, Low, Neutral, High Loc, and Low Loc. In High the center differential was unlocked {{and allowed the}} front and rear <b>propeller</b> shafts to <b>slip</b> as needed for full-time operation. The system could be manually shifted into High Loc which locked the center differential for a locked 50:50 torque split. Low and Low Loc applied reduction gearing with or without lock, depending on the mode selected. Neutral was also available for use of the PTO.|$|R
5000|$|In British English, {{the term}} [...] "drive shaft" [...] is {{restricted}} to a transverse shaft that transmits power to the wheels, especially the front wheels. A drive shaft connecting the gearbox to a rear differential is called a propeller shaft, or prop-shaft. A prop-shaft assembly consists of a <b>propeller</b> shaft, a <b>slip</b> joint and one or more universal joints. Where the engine and axles are separated from each other, as on four-wheel drive and rear-wheel drive vehicles, it is the propeller shaft that serves to transmit the drive force generated by the engine to the axles.|$|R
40|$|The screw {{propeller}} on airplanes is usually placed near other objects, and hence its performance may be modified by them. Results of tests on <b>propellers</b> free from <b>slip</b> stream obstructions, both fore and aft, are therefore subject to correction, {{for the effect}} of such obstructions {{and the purpose of}} the investigation was to determine the effect upon the thrust and torque coefficients and efficiency, for previously tested air propellers, of obstructions placed in the slip stream, it being realized that such previous tests had been conducted under somewhat ideal conditions that are impracticable of realization in flight. Simple geometrical forms were used for the initial investigation. Such forms offered the advantage of easy, exact reproduction at another time or in other laboratories, and it was believed that the effects of obstructions usually encountered might be deduced or surmise from those chosen...|$|R
40|$|The {{cavitating}} propeller wake is {{investigated in}} detail using PIV and shadow graph techniques {{to figure out}} the trace ability of bubble type of tracers, naturally generated by the decrease of the static pressure in a cavitation tunnel. Experiments are conducted in the conditions of the cavitating propeller wake containing strong vortices. The flow behaviors of bubble tracers are compared with those of normal solid particles. The bubbles grown from the nuclei melted in the cavitation tunnel could not influence on the additional buoyancy, producing good trace ability in the uniform flow. The comparison between bubbles and solids shows some discrepancies in the area around the tip vortex core of cavitating <b>propeller</b> wake. The <b>slip</b> velocity, indicating the difference of moving velocities between bubble and solid, induces rather high difference in the vorticity values of it. The results of comparison in terms of vorticity values showed good agreement in the region of mild ReS (Reynolds number based on the slip velocity), however, disagreement at high ReS over 1000. The large slip velocity and high ReS provided a velocity difference, especially in the high velocity gradient region. The slipstream region gives a range of 15 < ReS < 75; however, ReS is about 1000 at a high velocity gradient region of a tip vortex. The fitted vorticity reduction rate would give a reference for the prediction in a real flow when bubble tracers are utilized in PIV measurements of a vortical flow. The vorticity reduction rates are obtained according to the bubble size which is considered to affect the slip effect in the high velocity gradient region...|$|R
