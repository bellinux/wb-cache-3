We report two cases of epiglottis malposition during intubation with the Pentax-AWS. The standard technique of using the Pentax-AWS system involves direct elevation of the epiglottis for exposure of the vocal cords.

40|$|The {{internal}} thoracic artery (ITA) {{is considered}} to be the optimal conduit for surgical coronary artery revascularization. Variations in ITA anatomy are relatively common and may impact surgical results. The ITA usually arises from the intrascalenic (first) part of the subclavian artery (SCA) and, occasionally, from the interscalenic (second) part. Origination from the extrascalenic (third) part of the SCA is rare, with a reported incidence rate of 0. 5 % to 1. 0 % in anatomical studies, and 1. 5 % in one angiographic study. Such an aberrant ITA descends inferomedially, anterior to the distal attachment of the scalenus anterior muscle, <b>passes</b> <b>posterior</b> <b>to</b> the first rib and enters the thorax, from where it follows its usual course.

40|$|BACKGROUND Variations in the {{branching}} of {{the human}} aortic arch have clinical significance. An Aberrant Right Subclavian Artery (ARSA) arises as the last branch of the left-sided aortic arch distal to the normally-positioned left subclavian artery. ARSA usually remains asymptomatic and is revealed incidentally either radiologically or during anatomy dissection. It is associated with several congenital cardiovascular anomalies and some chromosomal syndromes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty cadavers were dissected and observed for aortic arch branching pattern variations during routine undergraduate dissection {{over a period of}} two years in Institute of Anatomy, Madurai Medical College, Madurai, Tamilnadu. RESULTS One case of aberrant right subclavian artery was noted. The right subclavian artery arose from the right lateral surface of proximal part of descending aorta distal to ligamentum arteriosum. It was seen to course upwards, obliquely towards the right, <b>passing</b> <b>posterior</b> <b>to</b> trachea and oesophagus. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve on arising from the right vagus ran transversely towards inferior pole of the right lateral lobe of thyroid gland and entered the larynx behind the cricothyroid joint. The course of right laryngeal nerve was short and non-recurrent. CONCLUSION Awareness of this anatomical variation will provide useful knowledge to anatomists, radiologists, cardiologists, vascular and thoracic surgeons and thereby prevent injury to aberrant right subclavian artery and right recurrent laryngeal nerve during radiological and surgical interventions. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} {{read the}} interesting article by Albayram et al (1), which concisely explained the anomalies of the vertebral arteries. We {{would like to}} present another rare case of bilateral vertebral arteries originating from the aortic arch. We inciden-tally diagnosed this condition {{on the basis of}} findings on a chest CT scan obtained in a patient with trauma. Our trauma chest CT protocol uses 8 2. 5 -mm detector configuration with a pitch of 1. 35, allowing us to scan the chest in under 10 seconds. After the study, we reconstruct 1. 25 -mm-thick images at 1. 25 -mm intervals. Both vertebral arteries originate from aortic arch (Figs 1 and 2). The left vertebral artery arises between the origins of the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries. An aberrant right vertebral artery arises from the descending aorta distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery, with a dilatation at the origin consistent with a Kommerel diverticulum (Figs 2 and 3), and it <b>passes</b> <b>posterior</b> <b>to</b> the esophagus (Fig 4). An aberrant right vertebral artery is a rare anomaly, and it can easily be distinguished from an aberrant right subclavian artery by the presence of the normal right subclavian artery (Fig 2) (2). High-resolution multidetector-row CT angiography enables the display of images from different views. These can be useful as a roadmap in interventional and surgical therapeutic deci-sion making, especially in patients with complex aortic arch anatomy...|$|R

Variations of course and number of renal vessels are not so uncommon and their knowledge is important for planning of minimally invasive renal surgeries. The earlier literature reports a prevalence of precaval right renal artery between 0. 8 % and 5 %. Normally, the right renal artery <b>passes</b> <b>posterior</b> <b>to</b> the inferior vena cava, {{but it can also}} be precaval where it passes anterior to inferior vena cava. The multidetector row contrast enhanced computed tomography angiography allows precise evaluation of renal vasculature. The aim of this retrospective study is to determine the prevalence of precaval right renal artery. Amongst 73 MDCT scans studied, we identified 4 cases of precaval right renal artery with the prevalence being 5. 48 %, more than what is reported in the earlier literature. We also report a single and dominant precaval right renal artery in one of the cases, which is a rare finding. On the basis of these results, we conclude that precaval right renal artery appears to be more common and so the knowledge of this variant holds a major clinical implication in preventing misinterpretation of radiological images and proper planning of interventional procedures and minimally invasive surgeries. 1...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the arterial vascular anatomy {{in the area}} of the sacrospinous ligament. METHODS: Cadaver pelvises were dissected to reveal the anatomy of the sacrospinous ligament with emphasis on vascular and neuroanatomy. Flexible rulers were used to measure the coccygeal branch in five hemipelvises. RESULTS: The pudendal vessels and nerve pass immediately medial and inferior to the ischial spine (within 0. 5 cm of the spine) and behind the sacrospinous ligament. The pudendal artery lies anterior to the sacrotuberous ligament, which passes behind the ischial spine to its attachment at the posterior ischial tuberosity. The inferior gluteal artery originates from the posterior or the anterior branch of the internal iliac artery to pass behind the sciatic nerve and the sacrospinous ligament. There is a 3 - to 5 -mm window in which the inferior gluteal vessel is left uncovered above the top of the sacrospinous ligament and below the lower edge of the main body of the sciatic nerve plexus. The coccygeal branch of the inferior gluteal artery passes immediately behind the midportion of the sacrospinous ligament and pierces the sacrotuberous ligament in multiple sites. The main body of the inferior gluteal artery leaves the pelvis by <b>passing</b> <b>posterior</b> <b>to</b> the upper edge of the sacrospinous ligament and following the inferior portion of the sciatic nerve out of the greater sciatic foramen.

40|$|Summary. Oncopeltus eyes grow by {{recruiting}} epidermal cells which become {{transformed into}} ommatidial components. We show by grafting experiments using a genetic label, that head epidermal cells from adults {{can also be}} recruited by growing larval eyes. However, prothoraeic cells sort out from the head epidermis and do not become incorporated into the eye.

40|$|A Bayesian {{framework}} is attractive {{in the context}} of prediction, but a fast recursive update of the predictive distribution has apparently been out of reach, in part because Monte Carlo methods are generally used to compute the predictive. This paper shows that online Bayesian prediction is possible by characterizing the Bayesian predictive update in terms of a bivariate copula, making it unnecessary <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> through the <b>posterior</b> <b>to</b> update the predictive. In standard models, the Bayesian predictive update corresponds to familiar choices of copula but, in nonparametric problems, the appropriate copula may not have a closed-form expression. In such cases, our new perspective suggests a fast recursive approximation to the predictive density, in the spirit of Newton's predictive recursion algorithm, but without requiring evaluation of normalizing constants.

40|$|Acquired {{flatfoot}} deformity {{caused by}} dysfunction of the posterior tibial tendon {{is a common}} clinical prob-lem. Treatment, which depends on {{the severity of the}} symptoms and the stage of the disease, includes non-operative options, such as rest, administration of anti-inflammatory medication, and immobilization, as well as operative options, such as tendon transfer, calcaneal os-teotomy, and several methods of arthrodesis. Anatomy and Pathophysiology The posterior tibial muscle forms part of the deep posterior compartment of the calf. It originates from the proximal third of the tibia and the interosseous mem-brane and <b>passes</b> immediately <b>posterior</b> <b>to</b> the medial malleolus, where it changes direction acutely 23. A groove in the posteromedial aspect of the distal part of the tibia holds the posterior tibial tendon but is not deep enough to keep the tendon from bow-stringing or dislocating after an injury 45. The flexor retinaculum, which is adja-cent to the medial malleolus, tethers the tendon and keeps it in the groove, preventing dislocation. Distally, this retinaculum blends with the sheath of the posterior tibial tendon and the superficial deltoid ligament. The posterior tibial tendon does not have a mesotenon, and there is an area of relative hypovascularity immediately distal to the medial malleolus that may contribute to degenerative changes of the tendon 15. The posterior tib-ial tendon divides anterior to the tuberosity of the na-vicular.

40|$|The {{presence}} {{of more than}} three coeliac trunk branches is a commonly encountered variant. Literature occasionally describes cases of middle or left colic arteries originating from the celiac trunks or its branches; however, the {{presence of}} an anomalous arterial connection between the celiac trunk and both the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries (SMA and IMA, respectively) has yet to be reported. Routine abdominal dissection of a male Caucasian cadaver, revealed {{the presence of an}} anomalous fourth arterial branch on the 4 -cm long coeliac trunk. The course of this artery was traced, and it terminated by anastomosing with the marginal artery of the mesenteric circulation. The distal termination point of this anomalous fourth coeliac branch was the marginal artery, 5 cm medial of the splenic flexure, anastomosing almost perpendicularly. The diameter of this anomalous artery was comparable with the left gastric artery at their origins. The artery coursed inferiorlaterally toward the splenic flexure, <b>passing</b> immediately <b>posterior</b> <b>to</b> both the pancreas and the splenic vein. The anastomosis point of this artery, near Griffith 2 ÃÜ 7 s Point, is normally considered a watershed region with dual arterial supply from both the SMA and IMA, allowing collateral circulation. This region has a relatively higher susceptibility to irreversible damage in ischemic diseases because of lower perfusion, thus, the anastomosis of atypical coeliac branches represents a rare case for consideration.

All measurements were performed before surgery, immediately after and, nine months after surgery. Results: the different points of the maxilla were averaged (PPMXS) and a height loss between 6. 29 % and 33. 6 % was observed, with an average of 17. 36 %. For the mandible (PPMXL) variations ranging from 6. 31 % of augmentation to 18. 8 % loss were observed, with an average of 2. 54 %.
