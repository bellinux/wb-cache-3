40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact {{effects of the}} <b>ribbed</b> <b>sheet</b> with three V-grooves by the {{nonlinear}} dynamic FEM. The numerical models considered the nonlinear constitutive equation with strain rate effect, large deformation theory, and self-contact control. The full histories of deformation in simple model, complete model and adaptive model are simulated successfully. With the different groove depths of 3, 4, 7, 10, 12 and 15 mm, different mesh types, and boundary conditions, the correspondent results of simulations are assessed. Detail discussions of the absorbed energy and buckling resistance of the different <b>ribbed</b> <b>sheets</b> on varying boundary conditions are presented. Furthermore, the various mesh types are examined in the simulations. And, the results of simulations are compared with the previous experimental works; the impact load of the suggested numerical model is in good agreement with the experiment. The main benefit of the proposed models will save the tremendous costs in the die designing and specimen producing while on the experimental works. The applied techniques of the numerical models are helpful {{for the design of}} <b>ribbed</b> <b>sheets</b> and correspondent impact analysis. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Interior space on the east side is also shaped by two high Gothic windows with partial stone mangered lining, which was supplemented with newly Gothic reconstruction. On {{the south side of the}} presbytery light flows through the third window similar to the eastern side. The windows are filled with colorful inside geometric stained glass. The same applies to the north nave. The great arcade on the west side opens the door to the adjoining southern chapel.

This study presents the theoretical analytical development in order to obtain the critical buckling moment of these sheets. This analysis uses concepts initially developed to calculate buckling resistance in monosymmetrical profiles that are very used in the metallic structure industry. Since the material used was PVC, that has different mechanical properties than steel and aluminum, it was necessary to consider the differences in the analytical treatment. It is important to emphasize that the results obtained are product of the co-operative work of engineers from industry and university...|$|R

The objective {{of the present study}} is to measure the local heat transfer distributions in a double wall ribbed square channel with 90 degrees continuous, 90 degrees saw tooth profiled and 60 degrees V-broken ribs. Comparison is made between the 90 degrees continuous ribs (Ple = 7 and 10 for a elD = 0. 15) and 90 degrees saw tooth <b>profiled</b> <b>rib</b> configurations (Ple = 7 for an elD = 0. 15) for the same rib height to the hydraulic diameter ratio (elD). The effect of pitch to rib height ratio (Ple = 7. 5, 10 and 12) of 60 degrees V-broken ribbed channel with a constant rib height to hydraulic diameter ratio (elD) of 0. 0625 on the local heat transfer distribution is studied. The Reynolds number based on duct hydraulic diameter is ranging from 10, 000 to 30, 000. A thin stainless steel foil of 0. 05 mm thickness is used as heater and infrared thermography technique is used to obtain the local temperature distribution on the surface. The images are captured in the periodically fully developed region of the channel. It is observed that the heat transfer augmentations in the channel with 90 degrees saw tooth <b>profiled</b> <b>ribs</b> are comparable with those of 90 degrees continuous ribs. The enhancements caused by 60 degrees V-broken ribs are higher than those of 90 degrees continuous ribs.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{numerical}} analysis on residual stress and strain fields in a rivet hole. This stage of study concerns improving of the fatigue performance of riveted joints in an airframe. Riveting, particularly in aviation, is a traditional but still commonly used method of joining sheet metal components. Aircraft structures are thin-walled ones, with coverings made of thin sheets stiffened by stringers, frames or <b>ribs.</b> <b>Sheets</b> are typically assembled by a multiple rivet or bolt joints. Rivets and bolts are also used to joint sheets and stiffeners. Therefore, fatigue resistance of the aircraft structure depends on tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands rivet joints, which are used to build it. The local numerical models of the joint are considered {{with regard to the}} aim introduced in the paper. Numerical FE simulations of an upsetting process are carried out using the LS-DYNA code. Three-dimensional numerical models are used to determine the resulting stress and strain fields at the mushroom rivet and around the hole. This type of problem requires the use of contact between the elements assembled and non-linear geometric and elasto-plastic multilinear material models to simulate the behaviour of the rivet and sheets. The influence of shape imperfection on strain and stress states is studied...|$|R

The Fast Lagrangian Analysis Continua (FLAC) program was used to verify the calculations of stress within the resin.

40|$|The {{development}} of surface roughening during uniaxial tensile deformation, with {{particular attention to}} the {{development of}} parallel ridges and valleys (<b>ribbed</b> <b>profile),</b> has been investigated for a commercial aluminium alloy. A comparison has been made between two samples which exhibit different propensities for roughening and a detailed microstructural characterisation of these samples has been performed in order to explain the differences. Microstructural characterisation techniques included polarised light microscopy, bulk texture and microtexture. In addition, yield properties were calculated from the microtexture data using polycrystal plasticity analysis. The results show that the differences in the roughening behaviour can be attributed to spatial differences in texture at the specimen surface whereby R-component colonies in a cube matrix produce differential straining, which eventually leads to strain localisation through the specimen thickness to produce a <b>ribbed</b> <b>profile...</b>|$|R

40|$|Research on {{rock bolting}} {{technology}} has been extensively pursued, in both civil and mining engineering, for several decades. The study of bolting technology embraced initially rigid re-bars and subsequently flexible cable bolts. Generally, the past studies were focused on bolt strength and their load bearing capacities in relation to physical size (length and diameter) and material properties. Very little work has been reported {{on the influence of}} bolt surface configuration on the load transfer mechanisms between the bolt and the host rock. Also, previous research on the influence of bolting on rock joint reinforcement and stabilisation has been carried out under Constant Normal Load (CNL) conditions, which does not reflect the actual deformation behaviour of reinforced joints. This matter has lately been recognised, and some recent publications have highlighted the shortcomings of the tests conducted under CNL conditions. Accordingly, this thesis is concerned with various aspects of bolt research related to the better understanding of the load transfer mechanisms between the bolt/resin/rock, and the impact of infill on the reinforced joint shear strength under Constant Normal Stiffness (CNS) condition. Two types of bolts, commonly used in Australian coal mines were used for both laboratory and field investigations, and referred to as type I and type II bolts, respecively. The shear behaviour of bolt/resin interface was studied under CNS condition in the laboratory by testing cast resin/plaster samples in a specially constructed CNS apparatus. The samples were tested for various loading cycles at initial normal stress (σno) levels ranging from 0. 1 to 7. 5 MPa, representing the in-situ horizontal stress condition in the field. Laboratory test results indicated that, bolts with deeper <b>rib</b> <b>profile</b> and wider <b>rib</b> spacing (e. g. bolt type I) offers higher shear resistance at low confining pressures less than 6 MPa, whereas, bolts with shallower <b>rib</b> <b>profile</b> with narrower <b>rib</b> spacing (e. g. bolt type II) offers marginally higher shear resistance at confining pressures exceeding 6 MPa.

Force-deflection tests were undertaken to determine the effective section properties that took into account the cold-formed section properties and irregularities from rolling during manufacture. High lateral earth pressures were measured during backfilling. A model was developed to demonstrate the formation of those pressures that approach the passive state. This {{has important implications for}} the design of buried structures and retaining walls. The response of helical culverts to legal live loads was examined.
