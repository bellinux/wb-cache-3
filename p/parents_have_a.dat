5|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Court, Justice Harry Blackmun held that natural <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the burden of proof used by New York State is not stringent enough to satisfy the constitutional requirements of the due process clause. In striking down New York's burden, the Court utilized the Mathews test to determine what burden of proof was due.|$|E

5|$|The video {{starts at}} the Clarksons' household. There, {{she and her husband}} are engaged in a heated {{argument}} and he threatens to smash down a picture of the family at one point. Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it into the sink while talking on the phone, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as she puts the father's dinner into the bin. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door in the younger Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then see that their daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self. Note that Kelly is holding Kennedy's hand in the scene where the childhood memories are revealed.|$|E

25|$|The {{separation}} by rank has {{the intended}} purpose of maintaining military discipline among service members. According to the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice, it can be illegal for an officer to fraternize with an enlisted person because it would erode the military hierarchy.

25|$|Research into {{military}} brats {{has consistently}} shown {{them to be}} better behaved than their civilian counterparts. Sociologist Phoebe Price posed three possible hypotheses as to why brats are better behaved: firstly, military <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lower threshold for misbehavior in their children; secondly, the mobility of teenagers might make them less likely to attract attention to themselves, as many want to fit in and are less secure with their surroundings; and thirdly, normative constraints are greater, with brats knowing that their behavior is under scrutiny and can affect the military member's career.|$|E
25|$|Experiences in a person's {{life are}} {{a major source of}} how {{self-esteem}} develops. In the early years of a child's life, <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significant influence on self-esteem and can be considered a main source of positive and negative experiences a child will have. Unconditional love from parents helps a child develop a stable sense of being cared for and respected. These feelings translate into later effects on self-esteem as the child grows older. Students in elementary school who have high self-esteem tend to have authoritative parents who are caring, supportive adults who set clear standards for their child and allow them to voice their opinion in decision making.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the small}} number of Chinese {{surnames}} leads to confusion in social environments, and because some Chinese <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> desire to give individuality, some Chinese have received unusual given names. As of April 2009, about 60 million Chinese people have unusual characters in their names. A 2006 report by the Chinese public security bureau stated that of about 55,000 Chinese characters used in the People's Republic of China, only 32,232 of those are supported by the ministry's computers. The PRC government has asked individuals with unusual names to change them so they can get new computer-readable public identity cards, and the diversity prevents them from receiving new identity cards if they do not change their names.|$|E

500|$|The dissent, {{written by}} Justice Rehnquist, opposed the ruling of the Court on two main points: matters of family {{law should be}} left to the states, and that the Court's {{analysis}} was too narrow. While the dissent agreed with the Court's determination that <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> due process right, they disagreed in the application of Mathews v. Eldridge. Quoting that case, the dissent clarified stating, [...] "substantial weight must be given to the good faith judgments of the individuals ... that the procedures they have provided assure fair consideration of the ... claims of individuals." [...] The dissent further argued that, by focusing narrowly on only the burden of proof in the statute, the majority failed {{to take into account the}} fairness of New York's scheme as a whole.|$|E
500|$|Pupils {{are also}} {{admitted}} to the sixth form aged 16 or 17, for which similar criteria is applied. External students must have at least five predicted A* GCSEs and will be given conditional offers based on how high their predicted grades are. In the event of over-subscription, priority {{will be given to}} internal applicants, followed by external applicants in Local Authority Care. Students are then ranked according to their predicted or actual GCSE results, and the distance to school is again used as a tiebreaker. Should entrance be refused for any reason, <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> statutory right of appeal, which is heard by the governors of the school. In 2007, the school was ordered to pay compensation to two pupils after it was deemed that they did not receive fair appeals because of what the Local Government Ombudsman deemed [...] "inappropriate links" [...] between the appeals panel and the governors.|$|E
500|$|Many {{guidelines}} and testing procedures have strict procedures for disclosure and confidentiality to allow individuals {{to decide when}} and how to receive their results and also to whom the results are made available. Financial institutions and businesses are faced with the question of whether to use genetic test results when assessing an individual, such as for life insurance or employment. The United Kingdom's insurance companies have agreed that until 2017 they will not use genetic information when writing insurance policies under , but Huntington's is explicitly excluded from this agreement. [...] As with other untreatable genetic conditions with a later onset, it is ethically questionable to perform pre-symptomatic testing on a child or adolescent, as there would be no medical benefit for that individual. There is consensus for testing only individuals who are considered cognitively mature, although there is a counter-argument that <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> right to make the decision on their child's behalf. With the lack of an effective treatment, testing a person under legal age who is not judged to be competent is considered unethical in most cases.|$|E

3000|$|In the Dutch {{educational}} system, {{the educational}} {{level in the}} home country of the parents is divided in three groups: low (no education or only primary school), middle (primary school and three years low level of high school), and high (at least four years of middle or high school). In this study, 2 % of the Dutch and 54 % of the immigrant <b>parents</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> low educational level, 13 % Dutch and 12 % immigrant <b>parents</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> middle educational level and 85 % Dutch and 34 % immigrant <b>parents</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> high educational level. The difference {{in the level of}} education of the parents of the Dutch and immigrant children was significant, χ 2 (2, N = 325) = 100.67, p < [...]. 001). Because of these differences, level of education of the parents was used as covariate in the analyses.|$|R
2500|$|Most deletions in {{chromosome}} 1p36 are new mutations, {{that occur}} before fertilization, during {{the formation of}} gametes (eggs or sperm). There have also been reports of patients with 1p36 deletion syndrome whose <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> balanced or symmetrical translocation. This means a portion of one chromosome is transferred to another chromosome, so the parent has the [...] "36" [...] portion of chromosome 1 attached in an alternate location. When this occurs, cell division creates gametes that are missing a piece of 36.|$|E
2500|$|V. moorii <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> total defended {{territory}} that is several {{times larger than}} the core area (which is the area where the parents {{spend most of their time}} and where the brood is located). The male and female divide the total territory into roughly equal subterritories without much overlap, with the brood located in-between these two subterritories. The subterritory borders are not fixed and will shift throughout the day, depending on the presence of intruders. Upon seeing an intruder, a parent will quickly dart out of the core territory to chase the intruder away. The parents will attack conspecifics as well as other fish species that enter the territory. Heterospecifics are attacked far more often than conspecifics, and include both predators (such as L. elongatus and N. fasciatus) and non-predators (such as O. ventralis and T. moorii which compete with V. moorii for food). [...] V. moorii attack fry-eating fish entering their territory more often if their brood is larger. This is reasonable because the <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> higher rate of return on parental investment in a large brood compared to a small one. V. moorii parents attack fry-eating fish more often than other types of fish, meaning they can concentrate their defensive efforts on the fish most dangerous to their fry. Rates of attack do not decrease significantly even as fry get older and larger because the environment has high predation pressure and even older fry will be quickly eaten without defense from the parents.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{argue that}} <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> large influence on how teen sexuality is viewed in the United States, {{as well as how}} teens view their own sexuality. Parents' views of adolescent sexuality vary greatly between different countries. In the United States, teen sexuality is generally viewed under the framework of [...] "adversarial individualism". This means that on a broader, societal level, there is little communication among individuals as compared to other countries such as the Netherlands where there is more emphasis on [...] "interdependent individualism". Scholars argue that in the United States, there is greater emphasis on individual success rather than success of the majority. This paradigm plays into adolescent sexuality in the way that there is less communication about oftentimes sensitive topics such as adolescent sexuality. Scholars argue that this mentality has several consequences. The negative consequences of adversarial individualism can present themselves as impulse-driven teenagers that ultimately require more supervision than teenagers living in an interdependent individualistic society. In interdependent individualism, teenagers are ultimately more responsible because they are able to have open discussions with their guardians.|$|E

30|$|Associations between parental {{education}} and science skills are significant as well, {{as shown in}} model 2.
