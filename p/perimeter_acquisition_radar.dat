Used primarily in the first minutes of the attack, and not responsible for the engagements, the system could be considered disposable and did not need anything like the sophistication or hardening of the MAR.

50|$|Sentinel was a {{proposed}} US Army anti-ballistic missile (ABM) {{system designed to}} provide a light layer of protection over the entire United States, able to defend against small ICBM strikes like those expected from China, or accidental launches from the USSR or other states. The system would have seventeen bases, each centered on its Missile Site Radar (MSR) and a computerized command center buried below it. The system was supported by a string of five long-range <b>Perimeter</b> <b>Acquisition</b> <b>Radars</b> (PAR) spread across the US/Canada border area and another in Alaska. The primary weapon was the long range Spartan missile, with short range Sprint missiles providing additional protection near US ICBM fields and PAR sites. The system would initially have a total of 480 Spartan and 192 Sprint missiles.|$|R
