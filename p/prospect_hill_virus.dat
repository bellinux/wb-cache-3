40|$|A {{panel of}} 24 {{monoclonal}} ntibodies (MAbs) to the G 1 or G 2 envelope glycoproteins of Hantaan virus {{were used to}} determine the surface topography and functional properties of antigenic sites. Nine distinct, partially overlapping antigenic sites, two on G 1 and seven on G 2, were demonstrated by competitive binding assays. Analyses of the antigenic sites by haemagglutination (HA) inhibition and plaque-reduction neutralization tests howed that all of the sites, except one on G 1, were related to viral HA. Only one of the G 1 antigenic sites and two of the G 2 sites were involved in virus neutralization. These results suggest hat certain epitopes related to HA were not critical for virus neutralization. The nine antigenic sites could be further divided into 13 based upon the serological cross-reactivity of MAbs with viruses representative of each of the four known antigenic groups within the Hantavirus genus of Bunyaviridae, i. e.

Infection with HPS-associated hantaviruses, NY- 1 and Sin Nombre virus (SNV), is inhibited by antibodies to β 3 integrins and by the β 3 -integrin ligand, vitronectin. In contrast, infection with the nonpathogenic (no associated human disease) <b>Prospect</b> <b>Hill</b> <b>virus</b> was inhibited by fibronectin and β 1 -specific antibodies but not by β 3 -specific antibodies or vitronectin.

Distinct miRNA expression profiles were observed in a cell type- and viral species-specific pattern. A subset of miRNAs, including miR- 151 - 5 p and miR- 1973, were differentially expressed between Hantaan virus and <b>Prospect</b> <b>Hill</b> <b>virus.</b> Pathway analyses confirmed that the targets of selected miRNAs were associated with inflammatory responses and innate immune receptor-mediated signaling pathways.

The identification in HARDS patients of serum immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibodies that cross-reacted with Hantaan, Seoul, and Puumala virus antigens first suggested that FCV is a hantavirus. Limited nucleotide sequence data from the FCV glycoprotein- 2 (G 2) confirmed that FCV is a hantavirus and showed that it is most closely related to Prospect Hill and Puumala viruses. We have molecularly cloned approximately 95 % of the sequences of the M and S segments of the FCV genome encoding the envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid protein N from the lungs of a patient with HARDS.

The bank vole MAbs were all specific for the nucleocapsid protein (N) of PUU virus, as determined by immunoprecipitation. When evaluated by additivity immunoassays, the MAbs were found to recognize several different, distinct or overlapping, epitopes on N. The MAbs were used in immunofluorescence assays to compare eight PUU-related virus isolates, and the prototype Han-taan, Urban rat and Prospect Hill viruses.

Rodents and their ectoparasites serve as reservoirs and vectors of myriad viruses and other pathogenic microbes. In contrast, the role of insectivores (or soricomorphs) in the transmission and ecology of zoonoses is largely unknown. Because some soricomorphs share habitats with rodents, shrews might also {{be involved in the}} maintenance of the enzootic cycle and contribute to the evolutionary history and genetic diversity of hantaviruses.

Expression of the cytoplasmic {{tail of the}} pathogenic NY- 1 hantavirus Gn protein is sufficient to inhibit RIG-I- and TBK 1 -directed IFN responses. The formation of TBK 1 -TRAF 3 complexes directs IRF- 3 phosphorylation, and both IRF- 3 and NF-κB activation are required for transcription from the IFN-β promoter. Here we report that the NY- 1 virus (NY- 1 V) Gn tail inhibits both TBK 1 -directed NF-κB activation and TBK 1 -directed transcription from promoters containing IFN-stimulated response elements. The NY- 1 V Gn tail coprecipitated TRAF 3 from cellular lysates, and analysis of TRAF 3 deletion mutants demonstrated that the TRAF 3 N terminus is sufficient for interacting with the NY- 1 V Gn tail. In contrast, the Gn tail of the nonpathogenic hantavirus <b>Prospect</b> <b>Hill</b> <b>virus</b> (PHV) failed to coprecipitate TRAF 3 or inhibit NF-κB or IFN-β transcriptional responses. Further, expression of the NY- 1 V Gn tail blocked TBK 1 coprecipitation of TRAF 3 and infection by NY- 1 V, but not PHV, blocked the formation of TBK 1 -TRAF 3 complexes.

FCV is related most closely to Puumala virus (PUU) and to <b>Prospect</b> <b>Hill</b> <b>virus</b> (PHV). Twenty-five acute HPS serum samples were tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibody reactivities to FCV-encoded recombinant proteins in Western blot (immunoblot) assays. All HPS serum samples contained both IgG and IgM antibodies to the FCV nucleocapsid (N) protein. FCV N antibodies cross-reacted with PUU N and PHV N proteins. A dominant FCV N epitope was mapped to the segment between amino acids 17 and 59 (QLVTARQKLKDAERAVELDPDDVNKSTLQSRRAAVSALETKLG). All HPS serum samples contained IgG antibodies to the FCV glycoprotein- 1 (G 1) protein, and 21 of 25 serum samples contained FCV G 1 IgM antibodies. The FCV G 1 antibodies did not cross-react with PUU G 1 and PHV G 1 proteins. The FCV G 1 type-specific antibody reactivity mapped to a segment between amino acids 59 and 89 (LKIESSCNFDLHVPATTTQKYNQVDWTKKSS). One hundred twenty-eight control serum samples were tested for IgG reactivities to the FCV N and G 1 proteins. Nine (7. 0 %) contained FCV N reactivities, 3 (2. 3 %) contained FCV G 1 reactivities, and one (0. 8 %) contained both FCV N and FCV G 1 reactivities.

40|$|Hantavirus {{pulmonary}} syndrome (HPS) is {{a severe}} respiratory disease which {{is thought to}} result from a dysregulated immune response to infection with pathogenic hantaviruses, such as Sin Nombre virus or Andes virus (ANDV). Other New World hantaviruses, such as <b>Prospect</b> <b>Hill</b> <b>virus</b> (PHV), have not been associated with human disease. Activation of an antiviral state and cell signaling in response to hantavirus infection were examined using human primary lung endothelial cells, the main target cell infected in HPS patients. PHV, but not ANDV, was found to induce a robust beta interferon (IFN-β) response early after infection of primary lung endothelial cells. The level of IFN induction correlated with IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF- 3) activation, in that IRF- 3 dimerization and nuclear translocation were detected in PHV but not ANDV infection. In addition, phosphorylated Stat- 1 / 2 levels were significantly lower in the ANDV-infected cells relative to PHV. Presumably, this reflects the lower level of IRF- 3 activation and initial IFN induced by ANDV relative to PHV. To determine whether, in addition, ANDV interference with IFN signaling {{also contributed to the}} low Stat- 1 / 2 activation seen in ANDV infection, the levels of exogenous IFN-β-induced Stat- 1 / 2 activation detectable in uninfected versus ANDV- or PHV-infected Vero-E 6 cells were examined. Surprisingly, both viruses were found to downregulate IFN-induced Stat- 1 / 2 activation. Analysis of cells transiently expressing only ANDV or PHV glycoproteins implicated these proteins in this downregulation. In conclusion, while both viruses can interfere with IFN signaling, there is a major difference in the initial interferon induction via IRF- 3 activation between ANDV and PHV in infected primary endothelial cells, and this correlates with the reported differences in pathogenicity of these viruses...|$|E
40|$|Pathogenic {{hantavirus}}es cause two human diseases: {{hantavirus pulmonary syndrome}} (HPS) and {{hemorrhagic fever}} with renal syndrome (HFRS). The hantavirus G 1 protein contains a long, 142 -amino-acid cytoplasmic tail, which in NY- 1 virus (NY- 1 V) is ubiquitinated and proteasomally degraded (E. Geimonen, I. Fernandez, I. N. Gavrilovskaya, and E. R. Mackow, J. Virol. 77 : 10760 - 10768, 2003). Here we report that the G 1 cytoplasmic tails of pathogenic Andes (HPS) and Hantaan (HFRS) viruses are also degraded by the proteasome and that, in contrast, the G 1 tail of nonpathogenic <b>Prospect</b> <b>Hill</b> <b>virus</b> (PHV) is stable and not proteasomally degraded. We determined that the signals which direct NY- 1 V G 1 tail degradation are present in a hydrophobic region within the C-terminal 30 residues of the protein. In contrast to that of PHV, the NY- 1 V hydrophobic domain directs the proteasomal degradation of green fluorescent protein and constitutes an autonomous degradation signal, or “degron,” within the NY- 1 V G 1 tail. Replacing 4 noncontiguous residues of the NY- 1 V G 1 tail with residues present in the stable PHV G 1 tail resulted in a NY- 1 V G 1 tail that was not degraded by the proteasome. In contrast, changing a different but overlapping set of 4 PHV residues to corresponding NY- 1 V residues directed proteasomal degradation of the PHV G 1 tail. The G 1 tails of pathogenic, but not nonpathogenic, hantaviruses contain intervening hydrophilic residues within the C-terminal hydrophobic domain, and amino acid substitutions that alter the stability or degradation of NY- 1 V or PHV G 1 tails result from removing or adding intervening hydrophilic residues. Our results identify residues that selectively direct the proteasomal degradation of pathogenic hantavirus G 1 tails. Although a role for the proteasomal degradation of the G 1 tail in HPS or HFRS is unclear, these findings link G 1 tail degradation to viral pathogenesis and suggest that degrons within hantavirus G 1 tails are potential virulence determinants...|$|E
