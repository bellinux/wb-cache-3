5000|$|Iōjima is of {{volcanic}} origin, {{and is the}} northern edge of the Kikai Caldera, a stratovolcano rising from the ocean floor to 703.7 m above sea level at its highest peak (Mount Iōdake). Kikai Caldera is ranked class A for volcanic activity. It is constantly erupting, emitting massive amounts of sulfur dioxide which causes damage to agricultural products. Hot springs high in iron concentration from the <b>port</b> <b>bottom</b> gush and due to contact with oxygen, the port waters change to a reddish-brown color. Due to the sulfur, the sea area around the island is yellow in color. This gave rise to the name [...] "Sulfur Island" [...] (Iōjima).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. An in-situ multi <b>port</b> <b>bottom</b> water sampler was {{designed}} to assess nutrient regeneration from sediment under and within 30 m downcurrent of raft cultured mussels in Totten Inlet, Washington State. Bottom water was simultaneously pumped {{through a series of}} color coded polyethylene tubes conveying water from ports at 2. 0, 20. 0 and 50. 0 cm above the sediment’s surface by peristaltic pump. Sediments under the rafts did not have elevated concentrations of total volatile solids when the samples were collected, but were anaerobic and contained between 1, 571 and 2, 620 µM of free sulfides. Free sulfides declined exponentially with distance from the raft complexes center and were 760 µM S = on the perimeter and at background beyond that. Statistically significant increases in all nutrients except nitrate were observed 2. 0 cm above the sediment’s surface under the rafts in comparison with reference conditions. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen, ammonium and phosphate were significantly elevated under the farm at elevations of 2. 0 and 20 cm but not at 50 cm height above the sediments. Consistent trends in concentrations of silicate were not observed at any distance or elevation. Significant increases were not observed for any nutrient above reference concentrations on the perimeter of the farm or at 30 m downcurrent. These results indicate that significant quantities of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate were being regenerated from sediments under the center of the rafts but that the regenerating area did not extend to or beyond the raft’s perimeter. When combined with simultaneous current speeds in the benthic boundary layer, this methodology will provide a simple and inexpensive means of determining the flux of nutrients from enriched sediments under aquaculture facilities located in waters shallow enough to allow surface connections with polyethylene tubing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article reports {{experimental}} results on supersonic combustion {{in a new}} facility. The facility is a combustion-driven shock tunnel, which is cheaper to build than the facilities in which such experiments are carried out conventionally. The observation region is a zone between two parallel flat plates with a 33 wedge attached to the upstream end of the bottom plate. Gaseous hydrogen is injected at an angle of 45 into an oncoming supersonic flow of Mach 2 (approximate) from a <b>port</b> on the <b>bottom</b> plate. The resulting flow field is visualized by a high speed camera in a dark background. Three different test gases, namely nitrogen, air, and oxygen-rich air are used, {{and the results are}} compared. A distinct luminosity due to combustion for oxygen-containing test gases is observed. Heat-transfer rates on a probe placed at the down-stream end of the observation region and midway between the parallel plates are measured and compared for the three cases. Wall static pressure at 28 mm downstream of the injection <b>port</b> on the <b>bottom</b> plate is also presented...|$|R
