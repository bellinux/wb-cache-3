40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe the current situation of patients with epilepsy after rehabilitation with emphasis on employment and education and to investigate if clinical factors at admission were associated with increase in employment or education. All patients that participated in a comprehensive rehabilitation were eligible. Data were collected from medical records at admission, during rehabilitation, at discharge and from a structured telephone interview at follow-up 1 - 17 years after admission. In total, 124 patients participated in the follow-up. <b>Participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>employment</b> or education improved from admission to follow-up in 38 patients. In univariable analysis, active epilepsy with tonic-clonic seizures at admission was significantly associated with increased <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>employment</b> or education at follow-up, so was decreased frequency of tonic-clonic seizures from admission to follow-up. The significance of the associations disappeared in adjusted multivariable analysis. <b>Participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>employment</b> or education was improved for many patients at follow-up.

This paper draws on interview discussions with Aboriginal women in Rockhampton, Central Queensland, along with findings from the research of others to offer a greater understanding of the mixed benefits of increased Indigenous employment.

With regards to the local area characteristics, the analysis is extended by including a new variable, which is the economic characteristic of the area. The results of the analysis show that the main determinants that influence the farmer’s decision to participate <b>in</b> off-farm <b>employment</b> are age, gender, household size, dependency ratio, remittance, land size, types of agricultural activities, working hours allocated to the farm, the ratio of income from agricultural sources in total income of the farmer.

30|$|Enforced {{minimum age}} and {{compulsory}} school laws change the age distribution of activities. We {{begin with the}} question: how important is age in time allocation? Time allocation varies with age {{for reasons other than}} regulation. Physical, mental, and emotional capacities for different types of work vary with human development. While there is ample scope for age to be an important determinant of time allocation even when minimum age regulations are completely unenforced, age appears to have a minor, often negligible, influence on time allocation. On average, age can account for 0.7 percent of the variation paid employment. The lack of explanatory power for age contrasts sharply with other influences that vary at the household, not child level. In African MICS countries, age accounts for 0.5 percent of the variation <b>in</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> paid <b>employment</b> (1.1 percent <b>in</b> non-African MICS countries).In contrast, household-level characteristics can account for 67 percent of the variation <b>in</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> paid <b>employment</b> <b>in</b> the African-MICS countries (58 percent in non-African).|$|R

Despite well-intentioned efforts of successive governments and their contribution of a range of targeted employment programs to address Indigenous social and economic issues for the last three decades, employment outcomes for Indigenous Australians have not risen significantly.

While seeking to avoid an essentialist discourse, the paper builds on the theory of diversity and ‘difference’ (instead of ‘sameness’) to demonstrate the relationship between feminine values, team member diversity, communication skills and representation. Multiple contextual factors are also recognised as influential better identified through a social constructionist approach to team development. ...|$|E
30|$|In fact, {{the impact}} of {{individual}} programmes on aggregate employment or beneficiary caseloads is often fairly modest. This is not necessarily surprising and need not be discouraging given that most programmes are highly targeted, investment of public resources is limited and program durations are short. But it also {{suggests that there is}} scope for better co-ordination between policy domains. In part, such co-ordination can be achieved by customizing policy parameters of individual measures. For instance, job-search incentives and requirements should arguably be co-ordinated with the provision of job-search assistance. More generally, financial incentives and benefit conditionality can increase <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>employment</b> services. To the extent that these services are effective, this should result in better employment prospects, and a possible virtuous cycle of reduced caseloads and improving service quality.|$|E
