25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1975, Fred Pierce, the newly {{appointed}} president of ABC Television, convinced Fred Silverman {{to become the first}} president and director of programming of the independent television production subsidiary ABC Entertainment, created from the network's namesake programming division.
