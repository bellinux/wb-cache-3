40|$|Research of the {{healthiness}} {{of winter}} wheat {{depending on the}} soil tillage system and rate of nitrogen fertilization were carried out in 1998 - 2001. The largest threat to the healthiness of plants was tan spot, which was caused by Pyrenophora tritici - repentis, especially in cropping season 1999 / 2000. The soil tillage system diversified the intensification of occurence of this pathogen, only in two last years of research. The most infected by P. tritici -i was wheat, which was cultivated in the direct sowing. Application of underplant crop of white clover in the direct sowing contributed to {{the improvement of the}} plants healthiness. The highest rate of nitrogen fertilization (120 kg N. ha - 1) in the highest degree favoured the damage of wheat by P. tritici - repentis, but only in two first years of research.

40|$|Powdery mildew fungi (Erysiphales) are {{probably}} {{the largest group of}} plant pathogens that remain uncharacterized from genetic and molecular points of view, with the only exception of the <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereals,</b> Blumeria graminis. Their nature as obligate biotrophic parasites and consequent inability to grow on culture media has significantly hampered research. A common bottleneck to the molecular genetic analysis of powdery mildew fungi is the availability of genomic DNA of suitable quality and in sufficient quantity. The so-called whole genome amplification technology has the potential to overcome this limitation. Here we present the application of phi 29 DNA polymerase-mediated multiple displacement amplification (MDA) to amplify the whole genome of Podosphaera fusca, the main causal agent of powdery mildew in cucurbits, to address this problem. The genome coverage and fidelity of the MDA process was evaluated by PCR amplification and sequencing of two genetics markers: the nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (CYTB). Our results show that MDA is a valuable tool for molecular genetic analysis of powdery mildew fungi {{that can be used for}} a number of downstream applications in different fields, such as epidemiology and population genetics or systematics.

40|$|Aegilops tauschii (2 n = 2 x = 14) is a diploid {{wild species}} which is {{reported}} {{as a donor}} of the D-genome of cultivated bread wheat. The main goal {{of this study was}} to examine the differences and similarities in chromosomes organization among accessions of Ae. tauschii with geographically diversed origin, which is believed as a potential source of genes, especially determining resistance to fungal diseases (i. e., leaf rust and <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew)</b> for breeding <b>of</b> <b>cereals.</b> We established and compared the fluorescence in situ hybridization patterns of 21 accessions of Ae. tauschii using various repetitive sequences mainly from the BAC library of wheat cultivar Chinese Spring. Results obtained for Ae. tauschii chromosomes revealed many similarities between analyzed accessions, however, some hybridization patterns were specific for accessions, which become from cognate regions of the World. The most noticeable differences were observed for accessions from China which were characterized by presence of distinct signals of pTa- 535 in the interstitial region of chromosome 3 D, less intensity of pTa- 86 signals in chromosome 2 D, as well as lack of additional signals of pTa- 86 in chromosomes 1 D, 5 D, or 6 D. Ae. tauschii of Chinese origin appeared homogeneous and separate from landraces that originated in western Asia. Ae. tauschii chromosomes showed similar hybridization patterns to wheat D-genome chromosomes, but some differences were also observed among both species. What is more, we identified reciprocal translocation between short arm of chromosome 1 D and long arm of chromosome 7 D in accession with Iranian origin. High polymorphism between analyzed accessions and extensive allelic variation were revealed using molecular markers associated with resistance genes. Majority of the markers localized in chromosomes 1 D and 2 D showed the diversity of banding patterns between accessions. Obtained results imply, that there is a moderate or high level of polymorphism in the genome of Ae. tauschii determined by a geographical origin, which we proved by cytogenetic and molecular markers analysis. Therefore, selected accessions might constitute an accessible source of variation for improvement of Triticeae species like wheat and triticale...|$|R
