50|$|Despite being genuine steamers, {{the ships}} still sported a light barque sailing rig on completion, {{although}} this anachronism was gradually reduced and eventually removed.

50|$|Mangroves however {{are very}} {{important}} for people living close to the coast. The {{reason for this is}} that mangroves offer products that can be used for cooking, building houses and fodder, as well as fish, and other food items. They also offer <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>floods</b> and pollutants. Moreover, mangroves are important for other ecosystems and host animals like fish, crab and shrimp.|$|R

50|$|Flood {{control is}} {{the primary purpose of}} the Grenada Lake Project. The Mississippi River Basin Flood Control Project was the direct result of the Great Flood of 1927.

5000|$|Flood {{management}} {{does not}} aim at total elimination or control of floods or providing total immunity {{from the effects}} of all magnitudes of floods, which is neither practicable from economic considerations nor even necessary, keeping in view other realities that are faced in the Indian context. Thus, a multi-pronged strategy ranging from modifying the floods by means of structural measures to learning to live with the floods by means of other non-structural measures is the goal of flood management. Measures for <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> extreme <b>floods</b> of low frequency are seldom economically feasible. The term [...] "flood management" [...] refers to the provision of a reasonable degree of <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>floods</b> by measures to mitigate the recurring havoc caused by floods. This is what is being done in flood plains of Gandak River in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh which are affected by floods.|$|R

50|$|Also {{prominent}} in East Frisia's history is its centuries old struggle against flooding by the North Sea.

50|$|In many cases, <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>flooding</b> is {{not only}} {{determined}} by {{the height of the}} embankments, but merely by the strength of the embankments. Most of the weak spots in the embankments collapse {{because of a lack of}} strength with regard to stability or internal erosion rather than be flooded. The key to a better utilization of the existing embankments and thereby reduction of the flood risks is to find ways to determine the very processes which undermine the strength of embankments with a high degree of certainty. The system must ultimately be able to sense weaknesses in tens of thousands of kilometers of embankments.|$|E

Sometimes a group of houses is built upon a single large platform of trees. The huts each possess a clay cooking pit or oven located in the center, with sleeping hammocks encircling it. Besides the hammocks, the only other furniture sometimes present are wooden stools, sometimes carved in the shapes of animals.|$|R

50|$|The western {{section of}} the island {{contains}} a freshwater pool surrounded by trees. At one point boats could moor here, but this is now discouraged.

In the 19th century, a large section of land was reclaimed, with a number of sea walls constructed. Along with extensive saltings surrounding the island, this offered partial <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>flooding.</b> At this time, Horsey Island partially connected to the neighbouring Hedge End Island; this was part of a plan to completely join the two islands together that was never completed owing to financial difficulties.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} {{significantly}} {{confined to a}} certain location {{as well as being}} restricted in distribution. The region which it is found in Kenya, Sagalla Hill, suffers from a declining size and quality of the habitat. Furthermore, {{as a result of the}} development of eucalyptus plantations in the area, the soil is dry and compact making it unsuitable for the survival of the Sagalla caecillian. The smooth bark eucalyptus are more of a threat because they tend to extract more water from the soil than the rough barked ones. Another factor that threatens the species is deforestation for the expansion of farming land area. Due to lack of vegetation especially along the streams, there is less <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>flooding</b> and erosion, hence, the caecillian species are made vulnerable.|$|E
50|$|Besides an {{improved}} <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>flooding</b> the river was, thus, brought into an almost natural state and {{this resulted in}} {{an improved}} quality of the recreational area within the city of Munich. The quality of the water has also improved due to the upgrading of the sewage plants along the river. The number of germs, however, is still relatively high. Together with other cities and communities along the Isar, Munich has set a goal {{to reduce the number}} of germs until the water quality is good enough to allow bathing in the river. If this is achieved, Munich would be one of the few big cities in Europe with a river with water of good enough quality to allow swimming in it. The sewer plants on the upper river are now treating the sewage with ultraviolet light, which greatly reduces the number of germs, but still the Isar cannot be guaranteed safe to bathe in because of the entrance of polluted rainwater into the river, especially during strong precipitation.|$|E
