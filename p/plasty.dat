25|$|If {{heart failure}} ensues after a {{myocardial}} infarction due to scarring and aneurysm formation, reconstructive surgery {{may be an}} option. These aneurysms bulge with every contraction, making it inefficient. Cooley and coworkers reported the first surgical treatment of a left ventricular aneurysm in 1958. They used a linear closure after their excision. In the 1980s, Vincent Dor developed a method using a circular patch stitched {{to the inside of}} the ventricle (the endoventricular circular patch <b>plasty</b> or Dor procedure) to close the defect after excision. Dor's approach has been modified by others and is today the preferred method for surgical treatment of incorrectly contracting (dyskinetic) left ventricle tissue, although a linear closure technique combined with septoplasty might be equally effective. The multicenter RESTORE trial of 1198 participants demonstrated an increase in ejection fraction from about 30% to 40% with a concomitant shift in NYHA classes, with an early mortality of 5% and a 5-year survival of 70%. It remains unknown if surgery is superior to optimal medical therapy. The STICH trial (Surgical Treatment for IschemiC Heart Failure) will examine the role of medical treatment, coronary artery bypass surgery and left ventricle remodeling surgery in heart failure patients. Results are expected to be published in 2009 and 2011.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} the patency of EVVP {{and its effect}} in symptom relief, ulcer healing and ulcer-free period in patients with PCVI. MethodsBetween 1993 and 2004, 1800 patients with CVI were evaluated and seventeen with PCVI were selected for EVVP. They were all investigated with ambulatory venous pressure measurement (AVP), colour duplex ultrasound (CDU), ascending venography and descending video venography. The CEAP classification was used to group the patients. Six patients were C 4, four C 5 and seven C 6. All had deep reflux {{and high levels of}} AVP. ResultsAll procedures were technically successful. The ulcer healing rate was 4 / 7 (57 %) within 3 months. All C 4 patients experienced symptom improvement postoperatively and had a median recurrence free period of 72 (range 60 – 122) months. The C 5 group had an median ulcer free period of 61 months (12 – 72) and the C 6 of median 48 (12 – 72) months. Single valve <b>plasties</b> (4) reached a median competence period of 48 months (12 – 72), 12 multiple valve <b>plasties</b> at the same level show a median 78 months (63 – 122) and 10 multilevel repairs median 54 months (12 – 96). Multiple valve <b>plasties</b> at the same level (multi-station <b>plasties)</b> performed on the C 4 group seemed to yield the longest durability with a median of 103 months (84 – 122).

30|$|A {{complete}} lesion of the ACL often {{causes a}} rotatory instability {{of the knee}} detectable with the pivot-shift test. During this complex phenomenon the tibia tends to internally rotate {{with respect to the}} femur, thus changing its rotational fulcrum which moves medially closer to the MCL, with following anterior translation of the external tibial plateau. The severity of the pivot-shift, commonly scored in three degrees, essentially depends on the amount of constitutional tibial rotation and on the presence of concomitant associated lesions, such as the ALFTL and the external meniscus. In order to obtain the best rotatory stability, the ACL reconstruction must be performed accurately, reproducing its anatomical positions (either single- or double-bundle). Non-anatomical reconstructions are basically erroneous. Peripheral <b>plasties</b> may contribute to better control of rotator instability and may be indicated in selected types of patients.|$|R

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Pilonidal sinus (PS) is {{a common}} chronic {{disorder}} of the sacrococcygeal region. The optimal treatment for PS remains controversial, and recent reports have advocated different surgical approaches. METHODS: A prospective study was performed on 103 patients with nonrecurrent quiescent chronic discharging sinus. Excision with primary closure was performed on all patients. Patients were subdivided randomly into 2 groups. In group A, the excision was associated with drainage of the wound; in group B, the wound was not drained. RESULTS: Excision with primary closure and drainage was performed in 53 patients (group A). Drainage was omitted in 50 patients (group B). Minor wound complications occurred in 3 patients in group A and in 36 patients in group B. No complete dehiscence of the wound was observed in patients in group A and in 8 patients in group B. Complete healing was fastest in patients in group A. Sinus recurrence occurred in 1 patient in group A and in 2 patients in group B. CONCLUSION: Short- and long-term results suggest that limited midline excision with primary closure and wound drainage is a simple and effective procedure in the surgical treatment of uncomplicated PS. More demanding flap techniques and <b>plasties</b> should be reserved for complicated PS, which requires a wider excision...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Medical {{implants}} and prostheses (artificial hips, tendono- and ligament <b>plasties)</b> {{usually are}} multi-component systems {{that may be}} machined from one of three material classes: metals, plastics and ceramics. Typically, the body-sided bonding element is bone. The purpose of this contribution is to describe developments carried out to optimize the techniques, connecting prosthesis to bone, {{to be joined by}} an adhesive bone cement at their interface. Although bonding of organic polymers to inorganic or organic surfaces and to bone has a long history, there remains a serious obstacle in realizing long-term high-bonding strengths in the in vivo body environment of ever present high humidity. Therefore, different pretreatments, individually adapted to the actual combination of materials, are needed to assure long term adhesive strength and stability against hydrolysis. This pretreatment for metal alloys may be silica layering; for PE-plastics, a specific plasma activation; and for bone, amphiphilic layering systems such that the hydrophilic properties of bone become better adapted to the hydrophobic properties of the bone cement. Amphiphilic layering systems are related to those developed in dentistry for dentine bonding. Specific pretreatment can significantly increase bond strengths, particularly after long term immersion in water under conditions similar to those in the human body. The bond strength between bone and plastic for example can be increased by a factor approaching 50 (pealing work increasing from 30 N/m to 1500 N/m).

40|$|ObjectiveIn a {{prospective}} phase II Food and Drug Administration trial, robotic mitral valve repairs were performed in 112 patients at 10 centers {{by using the}} da Vinci surgical system. The safety of performing valve repairs with computerized telemanipulation was studied. MethodsAfter institutional review board approval, informed consent was obtained. Patients had moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Operative technique included peripheral cardiopulmonary bypass, a 4 - to 5 -cm right minithoracotomy, a transthoracic aortic crossclamp, and antegrade cardioplegia. The successful study end point was grade 0 or 1 mitral regurgitation by transthoracic echocardiography at 1 month after surgery. ResultsValve repairs included quadrangular resections, sliding <b>plasties,</b> edge-to-edge approximations, and both chordal transfers and replacements. The average age was 56. 4 ± 0. 09 years (mean ± SEM). There were 77 (68. 8 %) men and 35 (31. 2 %) women. Valve pathology was myxomatous degeneration in 105 (91. 1 %), and 103 (92. 0 %) had type II leaflet prolapse. Leaflet repair times averaged 36. 7 ± 0. 2 minutes, with annuloplasty times of 39. 6 ± 0. 1 minutes. Total robot, aortic crossclamp, and cardiopulmonary bypass times were 77. 9 ± 0. 3 minutes, 2. 1 ± 0. 1 hours, and 2. 8 ± 0. 1 hours, respectively.

Robotic mitral valve repair provides the least-invasive surgical approach. We report the largest single-center robotic mitral valve repair experience. MethodsBetween May 2000 and November 2006, 300 patients underwent a robotic mitral valve repair (daVinci Surgical System; Intuitive Surgical, Inc, Sunnyvale, Calif). All operations were done with 3 - to 4 -cm right intercostal access, transthoracic aortic occlusion, and peripheral cardiopulmonary bypass. Repairs included 1 {{or a combination of}} trapezoidal/triangular leaflet resections, sliding <b>plasties,</b> chordal transfers/replacements, edge-to-edge approximations, and ring annuloplasties. Echocardiographic and survival follow-up were 93 % and 100 % complete, respectively. ResultsThere were 2 (0. 7 %) 30 -day mortalities and 6 (2. 0 %) late mortalities. No sternotomy conversions or mitral valve replacements were required. Immediate postrepair echocardiograms showed the following degrees of mitral regurgitation: none/trivial, 294 (98 %); mild, 3 (1. 0 %); moderate, 3 (1. 0 %); and severe, 0 (0. 0 %). Complications included 2 (0. 7 %) strokes, 2 transient ischemic attacks, 3 (1. 0 %) myocardial infarctions, and 7 (2. 3 %) reoperations for bleeding. The mean hospital stay was 5. 2 ± 4. 2 (standard deviation) days. Sixteen (5. 3 %) patients required a reoperation. Mean postoperative echocardiographic follow-up at 815 ± 459 (standard deviation) days demonstrated the following degrees of mitral regurgitation: none/trivial, 192 (68. 8 %); mild, 66 (23. 6 %); moderate, 15 (5. 4 %); and severe, 6 (2. 2 %).

From each of these two groups 100 hips (ninety-one patients in the Tharies group and eighty-six in the Trapezoidal- 28 group) that had been followed for two to seven years were evaluated at the time offollow-up in accordance with a predetermined protocol.

Male subjects (53 %) and sports trauma (78 %) predominated. Mean duration of instability was 92 months; mean age at surgery was 28 years. Twenty-eight percent of cases showed subtalar joint involvement. Four classes of surgical technique were distinguished: C 1, direct capsular ligamentous complex reattachment; C 2, augmented repair; C 3, ligamentoplasty using part of the peroneus brevis tendon and C 4, ligamentoplasty using the whole peroneus brevis tendon. Clinical and functional assessment used Karlsson and Good-Jones-Livingstone scores; radiologic assessment combined centered AP and lateral views, hindfoot weight-bearing Méary views and dynamic views (manual technique, Telos or self-imposed varus).

40|$|ObjectiveIntimal {{hyperplasia}} (IH) is {{most commonly}} {{the cause of}} graft occlusion in infrainguinal bypass grafting for arterial occlusive disease. We investigated the influence of nitric oxide on the IH of the arterial vessel wall at the region of prosthetic bypass anastomoses. MethodsExperiments were performed in 10 Foxhound dogs. We used a technique of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) overexpression by a non–virus-mediated, liposome-based iNOS gene transfer. The plasmid pSCMV-iNOS, which drives the expression of iNOS under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, was complexed with cationic liposomes (lipoplexes). Segments of both carotid arteries were pretreated by intramural injection of a lipoplex solution by using an infiltrator balloon catheter (Infiltrator Drug Delivery Balloon System). In each dog, iNOS was administered at one side, and a control vector (pSCMV 2) was administered at the contralateral side. Carotid arteries were ligated, and bypass grafts (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, 6 -mm, ring enforced) were implanted on both sides. The proximal and distal anastomoses (end-to-side fashion; running nonabsorbable sutures) {{were placed in the}} pretreated regions. After 6 months, the prostheses were excised, and the intimal thicknesses of 50 cross sections (orcein staining) of each anastomosis were measured planimetrically. ResultsThe average reduction of the neointima thickness of the iNOS side in proximal anastomoses at the prosthetic wall, suture region, and arterial wall was 43 %, 52 %, and 81 %, respectively. In distal anastomoses, the average reduction was 40 %, 47 %, and 52 %, respectively. All differences of neointima thickness between the iNOS and control sides were statistically significant (Wilcoxon test; P ≤. 05). ConclusionsInducible NOS expression is an efficient approach for inhibition of IH. In contrast to earlier studies, which investigated the efficacy of gene therapeutic NOS expression at 3 to 4 weeks after intervention, the novelty of our findings is that a single local lipoplex-mediated transfection of the vascular wall with iNOS-expressing plasmids leads to a reduction of IH in a prosthetic in vivo model even after 6 months. Because all components can be manufactured under Good Manufacturing Practice conditions (the quality-management system of the European pharmaceutical industry based on ISO 9000), this approach is also amenable to human therapy. Clinical RelevanceIntimal hyperplasia is a uniform adverse effect after vascular suture, endarterectomy, angioplasty, and stenting and is the most limiting factor with regard to long-term patency. Eradication of intimal hyperplasia by lipoplex gene transfer of inducible nitric oxide synthase would be a milestone in the development of vascular and endovascular procedures. The results of bypass grafting, {{as well as those of}} endarterectomies, patch <b>plasties,</b> angioplasties, and stents in supra-aortic, coronary, visceral, renal, and peripheral vessels, could thus be markedly improved. The manufacturing process of inducible nitric oxide synthase lipoplexes under Good Manufacturing Practice conditions is well established, but the substance is commercially not available yet. The promising results presented here should encourage the industry to commercialize inducible nitric oxide synthase lipoplexes and to foster necessary clinical and experimental studies within a wide range of possible applications...|$|R

These difference will be expressed in different transformed domains with the expectation that a certain domain will provide superior results. Once the signal differences have been determined they will be examined for their ability to quantify the looseness. Initially, a new definition of progressive, femoral component loosening was created, based on the application of mechanical fit, involving four general conditions. In order of increasing looseness the conditions (with their equivalent engineering associations) are listed as, firm (adherence), firm (interference), micro-loose (transition) and macro-loose (clearance). These conditions were then used to aid in the development and evaluation of a simple mathematical model based on an ordinary differential equation. Several possible parameters well suited to quantification such as gap displacement, cement/interface stiffness and apparent mass were the identified from the model. In addition, the development of this model provided {{a solution to the problem}} of unifying early and late loosening mentioned in the literature by Li et al. in 1995 and 1996. This unification permitted early (micro loose) and late (macro loose) loosening to be quantified, if necessary, with the same parameter. The quantification problem was posed as a detection problem by utilising a varying amplitude input. A set of detection techniques were developed to detect the quantity of a critical value, in this case a force. The detection techniques include deviation measures of the instantaneous frequency of the impulse response of the system (accuracy of 100 %), linearity of the systems response to Gaussian input (total accuracy of 97. 9 % over all realisations) and observed resonant frequency linearity with respect to displacement magnitude (accuracy of 100 %). Note, that as these techniques were developed with the model in mind their simulated performance was, therefore, considerably high. This critical value found by the detector was then fed into the model and a quantified output was calculated. The quantification techniques using the critical value approach include, ramped amplitude input resonant analysis (experimental accuracy of 94 %) and ramped amplitude input stochastic analysis (experimental accuracy of 90 %). These techniques were based on analysing the response of the system in the time-frequency domain and with respect to its short-time statistical moments to a ramping amplitude input force, respectively. In addition, other mechanically sound forms of analysis, were then applied to the output of the nonlinear model with the aim of quantifying the looseness or the integrity of fixation of the THA. The cement/interface stiffness and apparent mass techniques, inspired by the work of Chung et. al. in 1979, attempt to assess the integrity of fixation of the THA by tracking the mechanical behaviour of the components of the THA, using the frequency and magnitude of the raw transducer data. This technique has been developed fron the theory of Chung etal but with a differing perspective and provides accuracies of 82 % in experimentation and 71 % in simulation for the apparent mass and interface stiffness techniques, respectively. Theses techniques do not quantify all forms of clinical loosening, as clinical loosening can exist in many different forms, but they do quantify mechanical loosening or the mechanical functionality of the femoral component through related parameters that observe reduction in mechanical mass, stiffness and the amount of rattle generated by a select ghap betweent he bone/cement or prosthesis/cement interface. This form of mechanical loosening in currently extremely difficult to detect using radiographs. It is envisaged that a vibration test be used in conjunction with radiographs to provide a more complete picture of the integrity of fixation of the THA...|$|R
