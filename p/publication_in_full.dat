Despite their importance as cosmological distance indicators, the nature of their progenitors has remained controversial. Here we report the detection of circumstellar material in a normal Type Ia supernova. The expansion velocities, densities and dimensions of the circumstellar envelope indicate that this material was ejected from the progenitor system. The relatively low expansion velocities appear to favor a progenitor system where a white dwarf accretes material from a companion star which is in the red-giant phase at the time of explosion.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{systematically}} review published literature about the prevalence, incidence, and natural history of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in North America. Methods : A computer-assisted search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Current Contents/Science Edition databases was performed independently by two investigators. Study selection criteria included: 1) North American population-based sample of adults; 2) objective diagnostic criteria for IBS (i. e., Rome or Manning criteria); and 3) <b>publication</b> <b>in</b> <b>full</b> manuscript form in English. Eligible articles were reviewed in a duplicate and independent manner. Data extracted were converted into individual tables and presented in descriptive form. Results : The prevalence of IBS in North America ranges from 3 % to 20 %, with most prevalence estimates ranging from 10 % to 15 %. The prevalences of diarrhea-predominant and constipation-predominant IBS are both approximately 5 %. Published prevalence estimates by gender range from 2 : 1 female predominance to a ratio of 1 : 1. Constipation-predominant IBS is more common in female individuals. The prevalence of IBS varies minimally with age. No true population-based incidence studies or natural history studies were found. In one cohort surveyed on two occasions 1 yr apart, 9 % of subjects who were free of IBS at baseline reported IBS at follow-up producing an onset rate of 67 per 1000 person-years. In all, 38 % of patients meeting criteria for IBS did not meet IBS criteria at 1 -yr follow-up. Conclusion : Approximately 30 million people in North America meet the diagnostic criteria for IBS. However, data about the natural history of IBS is quite sparse and renewed efforts should be focused at developing appropriately designed trials of the epidemiology of IBS...|$|E
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} both archival and new {{infrared imaging}} {{observations of the}} field of the Anomalous X-ray Pulsar 1 RXS J 170849. 0 - 400910, in search of the infrared counterpart. This field has been previously investigated, and one of the sources consistent with the position of the AXP suggested as the counterpart. We, however, find that this object is more likely a background star, while another object within the positional error circle has non-stellar colors and shows evidence for variability. These two pieces of evidence, along with a consistency argument for the X-ray-to-infrared flux ratio, point to the second source being the more likely infrared counterpart to the AXP.

Since 21 -micron sources usually also have circumstellar molecular envelopes, the mapping of CO emission from the envelope will be useful in tracing the nebular structure. From observations made with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA), we find that a torus and spherical wind model can explain {{only part of the}} CO structure.

We find that the low-luminosity (10 ^{ 32. 5 } erg/sec at 7. 5 kpc) source previously observed near the core of M 92 with the ROSAT PSPC remains unresolved at HRI resolution; we can identify it with M 92 with 99 per cent confidence. In M 13 {{we find that the}} source seen with the ROSAT PSPC lies within the core and is possibly associated with the cluster (96 per cent confidence). We find probabilities of 99. 8 per cent (M 92) and 98 per cent (M 13) for the presence of additional unresolved emission within these globular clusters. We interpret these results in light of current theories regarding the low-luminosity sources. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures included with psfig.

The truncation process {{does not seem to be}} a sharp one though, in that lower-luminosity early-type galaxies in the inner core of the cluster are seen with significant Hdelta absorption, indicating some star formation within the last 1 - 2 Gyr. Some combination of stripping of gas from the outer parts of the galaxy, together with gradual exhaustion of the gas in the inner parts would be consistent with our data.

40|$|Background: Computational {{methods have}} been used to find {{duplicate}} biomedical <b>publications</b> <b>in</b> MEDLINE. <b>Full</b> text articles are becoming increasingly available, yet the similarities among them have not been systematically studied. Here, we quantitatively investigated the full text similarity of biomedical <b>publications</b> <b>in</b> PubMed Central. Methodology/Principal Findings: 72, 011 full text articles from PubMed Central (PMC) were parsed to generate three different datasets: full texts, sections, and paragraphs. Text similarity comparisons were performed on these datasets using the text similarity algorithm eTBLAST. We measured the frequency of similar text pairs and compared it among different datasets. We found that high abstract similarity can be used to predict high full text similarity with a specificity of 20. 1 % (95 % CI [17. 3 %, 23. 1 %]) and sensitivity of 99. 999 %. Abstract similarity and full text similarity have a moderate correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient: 20. 423) when the similarity ratio is above 0. 4.

We combine spectroscopic constraints, presented in Paper I, with stellar interior modeling to estimate stellar masses, radii, and ages. Stellar radii are typically constrained to 11 %, compared to 40 % when only photometric constraints are used. Stellar masses are constrained to 4 %, and ages are constrained to 30 %. We verify the integrity of the stellar parameters through comparisons with asteroseismic studies and Gaia parallaxes. We also recompute planetary radii for 2025 planet candidates. Because knowledge of planetary radii is often limited by uncertainties in stellar size, we improve the uncertainties in planet radii from typically 42 % to 12 %. We also leverage improved knowledge of stellar effective temperature to recompute incident stellar fluxes for the planets, now precise to 21 %, compared to a factor of two when derived from photometry.

These events are particularly useful for studies of extra-solar planets and faint stars. Approximately 17 degrees square were monitored at a sampling rate of up to 6 times per night. The images were analysed in real-time using a difference imaging technique. Twenty microlensing candidates were detected, of which 8 were alerted to the microlensing community whilst in progress. Approximately half of the candidates had high magnifications (>~ 10), at least one had very high magnification (>~ 50), and one exhibited a clear parallax effect. The details of these events are reported here, together with details of the on-line difference imaging technique. Some nova-like events were also observed and these are described, together with one asteroid.
