5|$|Sundaram, a poor man, {{comes to}} Madras with {{aspirations}} {{of becoming a}} film actor. However, he ends up getting {{a job in a}} restaurant called Greenlands Hotel as a waiter. While catering for a group of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>go</b> on an excursion to Mahabalipuram, he meets Radha, the daughter of his restaurateur, Chakravarthy. He misinterprets her friendly nature as love and falls in love with her. In the meantime, Sundaram happens to meet his friend Raghavan, an influential businessman, in the restaurant. During their subsequent meetings, Sundaram tells Raghavan about his ambition to become an actor as well as about his love for Radha, without mentioning her name. Raghavan genuinely believes that the girl reciprocates Sundaram's feelings and motivates Sundaram to express his love.|$|E
5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>go</b> through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E

For The Grapes of Wrath is possibly the best picture ever made from a so-so book...Camera craft purged the picture of the editorial rash that blotched the Steinbeck book. Cleared of excrescences, the residue is a great human story which made thousands of people, who damned the novel's phony conclusions, read it. It is the saga of an authentic U.S. farming family who lose their land. They wander, they suffer, but they endure. They are never quite defeated, and their survival is itself a triumph.|$|E
25|$|I {{believe that}} it is one of my strong collaborations. It already has me worried about the future. This is my best moment now, as far as the match I have musically with Sakis. Without wanting to put down all the people I have collaborated with I adore them like, ex, Giorgos Mazonakis. The <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>go</b> to see Sakis musically are very close to me, in {{relation}} to those who go to see a laïko artist. The track was recorded sometime in late November at Kontopoulos' studio, coinciding with the artists' busy rehearsal schedule for The S Club.

500|$|In 1956, Cagney {{undertook}} one of {{his very}} rare television roles, starring in Robert Montgomery's Soldiers From the War Returning. This was a favor to Montgomery, who needed a strong fall season opener to stop the network from dropping his series. Cagney's appearance ensured {{that it was a}} success. The actor made it clear to reporters afterwards that television was not his medium: [...] "I do enough work in movies. This is a high-tension business.

According to Wang, the group's website received 5,000 daily hits in 2009. He expected the audience size to grow [...] "as online video becomes {{part of everyday life}} for the up-and-coming generation of movie-watchers" [...] but believed that movie theaters will not become obsolete. University of Southern California digital media expert David Wertheimer also believed that [...] "Wong Fu's use of new media to tell their community stories and build a business is the wave of the future." [...] The group's success has allowed for growth in the popularity of Asian American comedians who promote themselves primarily through YouTube, such as Kevin Wu (KevJumba), Ryan Higa (Nigahiga), Christine Gambito (HappySlip), and David Choi. Although grateful for the group's success and popularity, Wang said, [...] "Some <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>go</b> to film school, they'll make something great but it's only seen by like, two hundred people [...] It's kind of not fair." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Adrift" [...] was {{produced}} {{as part of}} its own production block: block seven. Filming of the episode was [...] "double banked" [...] with block five, which consisted of the episodes [...] "From Out of the Rain" [...] and [...] "Fragments". This accounted for the lack of availability of some of the regular cast members. Unlike the rest of the episodes in the series, this episode was not solely produced by regular series Richard Stokes but by guest producer Sophie Fante. Discussing the premise of the story writer Chris Chibnall states that [...] "the issue of loss" [...] is what drives the narrative and that he had [...] "always wanted to write a story about <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>go</b> missing". Director Mark Everest noted that [...] "people go missing all the time" [...] and that to tackle this theme was [...] "a brave thing to do". Executive producer Russell T Davies felt it provided good drama to have a story that would also examine elements of [...] "paranoia" [...] and [...] "fear" [...] and [...] "mistrust" [...] between Gwen and Jack as result of her realising she does not know the full extent of his work within Torchwood. Davies later stated in his book The Writer's Tale that [...] "Adrift" [...] was one of the scripts that [...] "paved the way" [...] for the third series of the show; his intention being to write Torchwood characters as [...] "real people" [...] with [...] "families, feuds, aches and pains". The episode underwent less rewriting than any other script from the first two series with the final version being essentially a second draft. Gwen was initially referred to by her husband's surname, Williams, but Eve Myles vetoed this idea as she believed that an independent professional woman would want to keep her maiden name. A change made in the editing of the episode was the cutting of a short scene hinting at a possible romance between Nikki and Andy. This scene is included in the deleted scenes included in the series two boxset.|$|E
