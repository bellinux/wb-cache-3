40|$|ABSTRACT: The use of <b>pulsed</b> high {{hydrostatic}} <b>pressure</b> {{was investigated}} {{as a possible}} approach to stabilize foodstuffs. The objective {{of this article was}} to investigate the effect of the main processing variables (pressure [150 to 300 MPa], temperature levels [25 to 50 ◦C], and pulse number [1 to 10]) on the sanitation of nonpasteurized clear Annurca apple juice as well as freshly-squeezed clear orange juice. The aim of the article was the optimization of the process parameters in step-wise pressure treatment (pressure holding time of each pulse: 60 s, compression rate: 10. 5 MPa/s, decompression time: 2 to 5 s). The shelf life of the samples, processed at optimized conditions, was evaluated in terms of microbiological stability and quality retention. According to our experimental results, the efficiency of <b>pulsed</b> high <b>pressure</b> processes depends on the combination of pulse holding time and number of pulses. The <b>pulsed</b> high <b>pressure</b> cycles have no additive or synergetic effect on microbial count. The efficacy of the single pulses decreases with the increase of the pulse number and pressure level. Therefore the first pulse cycle ismore effective than the following ones. By couplingmoderate heating to high pressure, the lethality of the process increases but thermal degradation of the products can be detected. The optimization of the process condition thus results in a compromise between the reduction of the pressure value, due to the synergetic temperature action, and the achievement of quality of the final production.

Continuous harmonic and <b>pulsed</b> <b>pressure</b> waves are shown to be unsuitable to excite a mixture of differently sized bubbles due to their non-uniform resonance behaviour.
