25|$|The {{most common}} forms {{of skin cancer}} in humans, basal and {{squamous}} cell carcinomas, have been strongly linked to UVB exposure. The mechanism by which UVB induces these cancers is well understood—absorption of UVB radiation causes the pyrimidine bases in the DNA molecule to form dimers, resulting in transcription errors when the DNA replicates. These cancers are relatively mild and rarely fatal, although the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma sometimes requires extensive reconstructive surgery. By combining epidemiological data with results of animal studies, scientists have estimated that every one <b>percent</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> long-term stratospheric ozone would increase the incidence of these cancers by two percent.|$|E

However, the studies found wider variation, from 0 to over 3 percent, in their estimates for the effect on teenage unemployment (teenagers without a job and looking for one). In contrast to the simple supply and demand diagram, it was commonly found that teenagers withdrew from the labor force in response to the minimum wage, which produced the possibility of equal reductions in the supply as well as the demand for labor at a higher minimum wage and hence no impact on the unemployment rate. Using a variety of specifications of the employment and unemployment equations (using ordinary least squares vs. generalized least squares regression procedures, and linear vs. logarithmic specifications), they found that a 10 {{percent increase in the}} minimum wage caused a 1 <b>percent</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> teenage employment, and no change in the teenage unemployment rate.

The present study investigated the changes in single skinfold thickness during a 100 km ultramarathon. Methods: Firstly, we investigated associations between prerace preparation and prerace body composition and, secondly, changes in single skinfold thickness during a 100 km ultramarathon in 219 male ultramarathoners. Changes in fat mass and skeletal muscle were estimated using anthropometric methods. Results: Kilometers run weekly prerace and running speed during training were negatively associated with all skinfold thicknesses (P &lt; 0. 05) except for the front thigh skinfold. During the race, skinfold thickness at the pectoral (&minus; 0. 1 %), suprailiac (&minus; 1. 8 %), and calf (&minus; 0. 8 %) sites decreased (P &lt; 0. 05).
