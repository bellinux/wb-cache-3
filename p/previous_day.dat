40|$|Records of {{yield and}} {{breeding}} information for cows {{in the northeast}} part of the United States were analyzed to investigate the influence of days open present lactation, <b>days</b> open <b>previous</b> lactation, and <b>days</b> dry <b>previous</b> lactation on measures of lactation yield. Measures of yield were fat-corrected milk, milk, and milkfat all adjusted to a 305 -day, mature-equivalent basis. Analyses were conducted on first parity records (84, 356), first and second parities records (140, 233) and first, second, and third parities records (174, 251). The effects of <b>previous</b> <b>days</b> open, <b>previous</b> <b>days</b> dry and present days open were fit simultaneously. Best Linear Unbiased Estimate solutions were obtained;As present days open increased from 20 to 300 days open, lactation yields for fat-corrected milk, milk, and milkfat increased approximately 1250, 1350, and 45 kg. As <b>previous</b> <b>days</b> open increased from 20 to 300 days open, lactation yields for fat-corrected milk, milk, and milkfat increased approximately 625, 650, and 25 kg. Cows dry 60 to 69 days gave the most milk the following lactation. Cows dry 40 days or less produced much less the next lactation. All three measures of yield responded similarly {{to the effects of}} <b>previous</b> <b>days</b> open, <b>previous</b> <b>days</b> dry, and present days open;Multiparity analyses were conducted using a model where later parity records could be compared with more unselected first parity records. Adding additional parity information using this model made little difference in how cows responded to <b>previous</b> <b>days</b> dry and <b>previous</b> and present <b>days</b> open;Heritability estimates for <b>previous</b> <b>days</b> dry were approximately six per cent. Days dry were largely determined by environmental influences. Since heritability estimates for <b>previous</b> and present <b>days</b> open are also quite small, adjusting lactation yield records for <b>previous</b> <b>days</b> dry and <b>previous</b> and present <b>days</b> open is warranted;Multiplicative adjustment factors were developed for fat-corrected milk, milk, and milkfat. Adjustment factors could have a large impact on genetic cow evaluations which currently do not adjust for the largely environmental effects of days open and days dry...|$|R

5|$|The {{eastern side}} of Osterbeek was fairly stabilised after the retreat of the <b>previous</b> <b>day,</b> with {{numerous}} ad hoc units under company commanders defending the approaches to the town. Major Richard Lonsdale had taken command of the outlying units that had retreated from Arnhem the <b>previous</b> <b>day,</b> and their positions weathered heavy German attacks before falling {{back to the main}} divisional perimeter at Oosterbeek. This sector was later designated Lonsdale Force and would remain the main line of defence on the south eastern perimeter. The Border Regiment held most of {{the western edge of the}} town, with scattered units filling the gaps to the north. As more units fell back to the new defensive area, they were re-organised to establish a thumb shaped perimeter using the Rhine as its southern base.|$|E

5|$|At 3:20pm the ARVN 52nd Ranger Battalion were {{discharged}} on {{a landing}} zone about 3 kilometres south of Đồng Xoài.

On the night of June 10, the battalion began attacking Viet Cong positions around the Special Forces Camp, and they gradually recaptured the compound and much of the town. The Viet Cong eventually launched a counter-attack in an attempt to win back the loss ground, but they failed to dislodge the soldiers of the ARVN 52nd Ranger Battalion. The next morning, on June 11, the 118th Aviation Company was back at full strength in Phước Vinh. Like the <b>previous</b> <b>day,</b> they flew air-support and airlifted further reinforcements from the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion.
