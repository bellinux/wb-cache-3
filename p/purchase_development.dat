50|$|In 1996 the Town of Pittsford adopted its Greenprint Plan to {{preserve}} open space from the encroaching development {{that had taken}} {{so much of the}} town's countryside since the 1960s. The Greenprint involved the town's <b>purchase</b> of <b>development</b> rights to what was then two-thirds of Pittsford's remaining farmland. Initiated and successfully carried through by Supervisor William A. Carpenter, with passage of the Greenprint, Pittsford became the first town in the State of New York to save open space by <b>purchasing</b> <b>development</b> rights. In the years since, Pittsford's Greenprint has been recognized nationally and remains a frequently-cited example of successful open space preservation.|$|R

40|$|So far, {{academic}} literature has paid extensive {{attention to the}} importance of <b>purchasing</b> <b>development</b> {{within the context of the}} current business environment, emphasizing value creation and delivery and integrated supply chain management. In addition, the contribution of purchasing’s (internal service) performance to an organization’s success has been widely claimed. Despite the current focus on purchasing maturity, internal service performance and purchasing performance, only scarce attention has been given to their interrelationships. By means of an extensive literature study, a framework that outlines how purchasing maturity leads to purchasing performance is unfolded and tested. In particular, we state that internal customer satisfaction plays a mediating role between purchasing maturity and purchasing savings realized. Thereby, the moderating role of purchasing category and internal customer differentiation on the effects of purchasing maturity is depicted as well. Currently, hypotheses are tested at the purchasing project level by means of an empirical study on a large purchasing database of a case company. The present study uncovers a large and unexplored intra-organizational research field within the scope of <b>purchasing</b> <b>development</b> and performance...|$|R

Results suggest that support for referenda that <b>purchase</b> <b>development</b> rights is stronger in counties and towns with both rapidly increasing population and where land and house values have increased at higher rates. Environmental factors such as the prevalence of resource-sensitive lands are also significant in describing the public's motivation to preserve farmland. ...|$|E

40|$|Multiple {{ownership}} of land {{can act as}} a significant barrier to brownfield redevelopment. Despite renewed interest in compulsory purchase, it is unlikely to become the normal remedy for multiple ownership, owing to its cost and complexity. Drawing on international experience and recent research, this article proposes the concept of an Urban Partnership Zone, in which existing landowners would be entitled to participate alongside the local authority and a chosen development partner in a joint-venture redevelopment company. Combined with greater planning certainty and other benefits, this innovation would enable the development process to operate more rapidly without immediate compulsory purchase.

40|$|Airports {{are unique}} retail environments {{due to the}} {{environmental}} and psychological issues linked with the travel process. Travellers experience feelings of anxiety, stress and excitement which make them react in unusual ways. Airport retail environments therefore differ from more day-to-day channels of distribution. Consequently, retailers' approaches must also differ in order to maximise performance. There is evidence of a considerable impulse purchasing effect in airport retail operations which, if understood and harnessed by airport retailers, can enhance performance. The impulse effects will differ significantly between customer segments due to both the psychological effects of the travel experience {{and the existence of}} normative traits. Retailers must create an environment that minimises inherent stress and accentuates or at least maintains natural levels of excitement, while also virtuously motivating impulse purchasing by reducing or eliminating barriers to <b>purchase.</b> <b>Development</b> of an impulse strategy, which should permeate all elements of airport retail activities, is essential for maximising performance and profitability...|$|E

40|$|Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) {{has become}} {{mandatory}} {{in the current}} economic era. Socially Responsible Purchasing (SRP) is a derivative of CSR and relates to the acquisition of external resources at the most favorable conditions. ‘Most favorable’ here also includes ‘socially responsible’. At the same time, {{little is known about}} what organizations can do to ensure social responsibility throughout their supply chain. This paper addresses the topic of how the purchasing function in organizations can be turned into a window of opportunity for creating sustainable supply chains. By reviewing literature a preliminary Socially Responsible <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Development</b> Model is proposed. This model was refined through a focus group discussion and company documentation analysis. An in-depth case study at an organization (i. e. a leading European bank) highly committed to CSR provided for an empirical assessment of our Socially Responsible <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Development</b> Model. Based on this assessment this paper delineates the major challenges that must be addressed when putting SRP in practice. Our study demonstrates that the tactical process of prioritization of SRP activities is the main reason for the apparent mismatch between the initial ambitions of (purchasing) managers on one hand and the structural role out of the SRP project studied on the other hand...|$|R

A conceptual model is developed and tested on a sample of business relationships in business-to-business contract catering. The results support the fundamental effect that relationship satisfaction improves customer retention. The research also finds that the <b>purchase</b> <b>development</b> of contract catering customers increases retention, in particular if the customer who purchases more is also satisfied. However, when the contract caterer has achieved change in the customer firm, customer is reduced.

Further, the analysis shows that the PDR and PES implementation at 4 regencies/city government at KBU should be considered as a good prospect, even though seeing from the finances aspect of APBD, the prospect was still less than the target.   Therefore, continous finance policy support at the regencies/city government at that KBU which aimed to provide environmental protection and agricultural farm (pro-environmental budgeting policy) should be considered as emergency needs.

40|$|Focus of the Study From mid-February to mid-May 2012, a {{research}} {{team at the}} University of Nebraska-Lincoln surveyed 506 owners whose agricultural land was protected from development through conservation easements that were {{funded in part by}} USDA’s Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program (FRPP). This program “provides matching funds to help <b>purchase</b> <b>development</b> rights to keep productive farm and ranchland in agricultural uses. Working through existing programs, USDA partners with State, tribal, or local governments and non-governmental organizations to acquire conservation easements or other interests in land from landowners, USDA provides up to 50 percent of the fair market easement value of the conservation easement. ” 1 The survey had the purpose of evaluating the FRPP by asking participating owners about what they have done with their land and how satisfied were they with their experiences of protected farm and ranch land. The survey was funded through a contribution agreement between USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, the agency that administers the FRPP, and American Farmland Trust (AFT), a private non-profit organization that since its founding in 1980 has promoted protection of working agricultural land through easements and other means. 2 AFT contracted with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to conduct the survey, analyze the interview data, and write this report.
