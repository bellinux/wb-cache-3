Videotapes of compulsory routines performed by 16 gymnasts on bars, beam and floor were constructed to simulate a competition. Eighteen judges, nine novice and nine experienced, evaluated the routines. They were also required to rate their perception of the aesthetic appeal of the 16 gymnasts' body shape. Each gymnasts' body mass index (BMI) was calculated from their height and weight measurements to quantify body shape. The scores were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance. The results showed a significant main effect of BMI on judges' perception of gymnasts' body shape scores, $F(3, 48) = 9. 50, p<. 001. $ Gymnasts with a medium-low BMI received significantly higher perception scores than gymnasts with a medium-high BMI and gymnasts with a high BMI.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Aims of {{this study}} were: a) to {{identify}} anthropometric variables correlated with gymnastic performance, and b) to predict <b>performance</b> <b>scores</b> {{from a combination of}} anthropometric dimensions. METHODS: Experimental design: correlational analysis and a stepwise multiple regression were used. Setting: Subjects were participants at the 24 th World Championships Artistic Gymnastics, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, in 1987. Participants: A total of 168 female gymnasts (mean age: 16. 5 +/- 1. 8 years) were investigated. Each gymnast participated in all events. Measures: An extensive battery of anthropometric dimensions was taken on each athlete. The somatotype was estimated. Skeletal maturation of the hand-wrist was assessed. Competition scores for the four individual gymnastic events (balance beam, floor exercise, vault, uneven bars) and a composite score for each gymnast were the dependent variables. RESULTS: Moderately high, significant correlations (p < 0. 01) were observed between skinfolds and endomorphy, and gymnastics <b>performance</b> <b>scores,</b> r varying from - 0. 38 to - 0. 60, for biceps skinfold and the score on balance beam, and for endomorphy and the total score, respectively. The correlations suggest that gymnasts with more subcutaneous fat and higher endomorphy have lower <b>performance</b> <b>scores.</b> About 32 % to 45 % of the variance in gymnastic <b>performance</b> <b>scores</b> could be explained by anthropometric dimensions and/or derived variables, but endomorphy and chronological age are the most important predictors. CONCLUSIONS: There is a relatively strong relationship between several anthropometric variables and gymnastic performance in a sample of elite female gymnasts, but the associations are not sufficiently high to predict <b>performance</b> <b>scores</b> on an individual basis. status: publishe...|$|R
