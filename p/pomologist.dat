40|$|Romania, {{a country}} in eastern Europe, {{which is about the}} size of the state of Wyoming, has a long history of apple production. Production figures during the last several years show that it may be the ninth or tenth largest apple {{producing}} country in the world, with about 100, 000 hectares of apples. During the last 10 to 20 years, most of the apples from Romania that have been sold outside of local village markets have been produced on large plantings of apples on state-owned farms or cooperatives. Most of the apple planting systems, which were originally adopted from Italian <b>pomologists,</b> are remarkably similar in all of the older established apple orchards on the state farms throughout the country...|$|R

25|$|Since Herefordshire was and {{is renowned}} for its cider and perry, an early project of the club was to {{document}} and conserve local apple and pear cultivars. To this end, the club held annual exhibitions of local fruit, inviting leading <b>pomologists</b> to help identify samples collected or submitted from local orchards. Under the enthusiastic direction of founder and {{past president of the}} club, Dr Henry Graves Bull, two local artists, his daughter Edith Elizabeth Bull and Alice Blanche Ellis, were engaged to paint watercolours of the fruit, whilst an honorary member, Dr Robert Hogg, vice-president of the Royal Horticultural Society, wrote text to accompany the paintings. The result was the Herefordshire Pomona, a major publication for the club, issued in parts between 1878 and 1884, with over 400 paintings reproduced as hand-coloured lithographs.|$|R
40|$|The author {{concentrated}} on letters among J.

The letters contain valuable information not only about their personal life but also about their everyday life, about the cultural and political development of the Czech society {{during the second half}} of the 19 th century. They have also other dimension given by the fact that J. Němec worked in Russia. It is possible to find interesting facts in his letters that broaden our knowledge about the history of travelling, about the way of life of Russian and Tartar people, about the life of Czechs in Russia and the information about the history of medicine. Because both sons were distinguished <b>pomologists,</b> information about the development of this field is noticed, too. The family letters contain also the important information about so called B. Němcová's second life...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} related to the {{problems}} of translating horticultural terms and names. We deal with the translation issues of botanical names in general, then we focus on some old apple varietal names (Pónyik, Batul, Tányéralma, etc.) and the way these names are treated in English/Romanian texts. We also present some aspects related to the historical background of name giving and pomology. Our aim is to identify the main tendencies of such names in scientific writings and other types of texts. Prior to the publication of the Cultivated Code in the 1950 s, the situation of varietal names was rather ambiguous, and sometimes several varietal names were circulating for the very same fruit variety or cultivar. That is why today we still talk about synonymy and translation in the field of variety names {{despite the fact that the}} Code stipulates a preference for non-translation. We also attempt to analyse the etymological implications of the above mentioned apple variety names, as especially Pónyik and Batul are equally claimed by Hungarian and Romanian <b>pomologists...</b>|$|R

40|$|Fruit {{thinning}} {{is defined}} as the removal of certain flowers or clusters of flowers or individual fruitlets after fruit set and natural dropping have occurred. it improves fruit yield and quality and return bloom for the following year. There are three types of thinning namely:hand,mechanical and chemical. Chemical thinning is {{the most common type of}} thinning. Various chemicals are used for thinning. Still many more are being introduced into the market and they have varying effects on fruit quality and yield,depending on the fruit species and cultivar in question. The effects of these chemicals on fruit set is affected by environmental and ecological factors among other crop factors such as vigour. Alot of research has been conducted or is being conducted on chemical thinning but varied results are generated due to many chemicals being released by the chemical companies and varying farmer situations,yet this topic is of immence interest to chemical companies,researchers,farmers and the fruit industry. This paper discusses the various factors involved in fruit thinning but mainly the physiological principles behind the process of fruit thinning. A lot of research on thinning has been conducted on Apples and other temperate fruits but not on other fruits such as citrus which has worldwide significance. This review will mainly help <b>pomologists</b> who are conducting research on this area. Key words:fruit,thinning,chemical,chemicals,yield,quality,return bloom,physiologica...|$|R

5000|$|Following this, Hoffy {{began work}} with the {{physician}} and amateur <b>pomologist</b> William D.

The illustrations were produced as stone lithographs drawn by Hoffy (signed [...] "From Nature by A. Hoffy") and colored under his direction. The fruit is usually shown in a full-color side view, sometimes accompanied by a simple black outline of the fruit's profile. Hoffy and Brincklé felt this series was needed because of [...] "repeated disappointments which have attended the cultivation of Foreign Fruits in this country" [...] and also to clear up increasing confusion over common fruit names. The entire series was published together in 1860 in a single volume as Hoffy's North American <b>Pomologist.</b>|$|E
