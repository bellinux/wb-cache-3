5000|$|The Q2 is a [...] "taildragger" [...] with fixed (non-retractable) mainwheels faired into spats {{located at}} {{the tips of the}} forward wing, acting like {{endplates}} (increasing effective aspect ratio).

2500|$|The 1981 and 1982 {{models were}} {{designated}} as the Tomahawk II. They incorporated improved cabin heating and windshield defroster performance, an improved elevator trim system, improved engine thrust vector, 100% airframe zinc-chromate anti-corrosion treatment, better cockpit soundproofing, larger 6" [...] wheels and tires for greater <b>propeller</b> ground <b>clearance</b> and improved performance on grass and dirt runways, among other enhancements.|$|R
50|$|Amber had an {{inverted}} v-tail, which would prove a popular configuration for a pusher UAV, since it protected the propeller during takeoff and landing. The airframe {{was made of}} plastic and composite materials, mostly Kevlar, and the UAV had retractable stiltlike tricycle landing gear to ensure <b>propeller</b> <b>clearance.</b> Amber had a flight endurance of 38 hours or more.|$|E
50|$|The Quickie has fixed (non-retractable) {{main wheels}} faired into spats {{located at the}} tips of the forward wing. The absence of {{separate}} landing gear helps to reduce both weight and drag, such savings allowing a smaller engine and a smaller fuel tank. Even though the propeller is of small diameter, <b>propeller</b> <b>clearance</b> remains limited and the Quickie is rather vulnerable to ground strikes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} wood with its flying surfaces covered in doped aircraft fabric. Its 9 m span wing employs single supporting struts. The standard recommended engine is the [...] Hirth F23 two-stroke powerplant or the JPX 505. Differences with the earlier MB 02 include longer main landing gear legs to allow more <b>propeller</b> <b>clearance</b> and an aerodynamic cowling.|$|E
50|$|The Pilatus PC-6 Porter is a Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) utility aircraft. The {{majority}} of aircraft are {{powered by a}} single Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A turboprop engine, which drives a fully reversible, constant-speed, three-bladed HC-B3TN-3D (or an alternative four-bladed HC-D4N-3P unit) Hartzell aluminium propeller via a reduction gearbox. Pilatus claims that it possesses unique STOL capabilities, capable of landing in places only otherwise accessible by rotorcraft. It is fully capable of being operated from unprepared rough airstrips, in remote areas, hot climates and at high altitudes in all-weather conditions. In particular, the undercarriage employed provides for high wing and <b>propeller</b> <b>clearances,</b> making the PC-6 less susceptible to damage than conventional nosewheel-type undercarriages. For further landing versatility, various types of landing gear may be optionally installed allowing it to operate from different types of terrain; options include floats for water landings and skis for landing on snow.|$|R
50|$|For simplicity, {{and so that}} a {{nosewheel}} {{would not}} obscure the forward field of the radar scanner, a fixed tailwheel undercarriage was used. The long stroke necessary on the main undercarriage to allow for heavy deck landings while giving the radar scanner and <b>propeller</b> adequate <b>clearance</b> from the ground resulted in an alarming attitude {{on the ground and}} the cockpits mounted at a seemingly perilous height. For landing the tailwheel extended so it could land at a more level attitude.|$|R
50|$|Due to a {{generally}} high thrust line (needed for <b>propeller</b> ground <b>clearance),</b> negative (down) pitching moment and sometimes absence of prop-wash over the tail, higher speed and longer roll {{is required for}} takeoff compared to tractor aircraft. Main gear located too far aft (aft of empty aircraft center of gravity) may require higher takeoff rotation speed or even prevent the rotation. The Rutan answer to this problem is to lower {{the nose of the}} aircraft at rest such that the empty center of gravity is then ahead of the main wheels.|$|R
5000|$|The engine has a 2.7:1 Propeller Speed Reduction Unit (PSRU) with {{helical gears}} in an oil bath. Final {{drive to the}} wooden 63 in {{diameter}} 2-blade Hoffman propeller was via a rubber “doughnut” coupling. The PSRU design sited the axis of the propeller below that of the crankshaft. This feature allowed a more pointed nose on the ARV, {{at the cost of}} slightly reduced <b>propeller</b> <b>clearance.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Lancer {{achieved}} {{its goal}} of being the least expensive American-built twin engine airplane. Other design goals included simplicity, ease of maintenance, low operating costs, {{and the ability to}} operate from rough or unimproved strips. The high wing and high engine position give good <b>propeller</b> <b>clearance</b> in achieving that last goal. The Lancer is of metal tube construction with fiberglass covering and has fixed landing gear and propellers.|$|E
50|$|The Hewland AE75 {{was never}} fitted to any {{aircraft}} {{apart from the}} ARV Super2, and when ARV production ceased, Hewland stopped AE75 production also. The rights to the AE75 were bought by MidWest, who were developing their AE100 twin-rotor Wankel aero-engine. MidWest had intended to restart production of the AE75 near Stroud, Gloucestershire, but this never materialised. MidWest based the AE100’s gearbox on the AE75’s PSRU, amending {{it so that the}} propeller axis was above the eccentric shaft's axis. This increased <b>propeller</b> <b>clearance,</b> but also raised the ARV's thrust line.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 2000 to produce a single product, the Soaring Concepts Sky Trek, a powered {{parachute}} design that is optimized {{for use as a}} trainer. It has a higher than normal <b>propeller</b> ground <b>clearance</b> and larger diameter 4130 steel tubing for added strength, as well as other features that make it suitable for training use. The aircraft has been accepted as a light-sport aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). By August 2015 the company had produced at least 25 aircraft that had been registered in the US by the FAA.|$|R
50|$|The Kort nozzle is {{a sturdy}} {{cylindrical}} structure around a special <b>propeller</b> having minimum <b>clearance</b> between the <b>propeller</b> blades {{and the inner}} wall of the Kort nozzle. The thrust-to-power ratio is enhanced because the water approaches the propeller in a linear configuration and exits the nozzle the same way. The Kort nozzle is named after its inventor, but many brands exist.|$|R
40|$|Summary. [...] Tank {{tests were}} {{required}} {{to find out whether}} the water characteristics of a hull with a main step, faired in both planform and elevation, were comparable with those of a hull with a conventional Vee or transverse step. Stability diagrams and spray and resistance characteristics were obtained over a large range of loadings (Czx 0 = 0. 616 to Czx 0 = 1 - 440). The fully faired step offers more possibility of designing a longitudin ally stable flying boat hull than does the convention al transverse or Vee step, but a hull with such a step is 5 to 10 per cent. less efficient hydrodynamically except at high speed. In order to avoid running too fine at high speed, it is recommended that the centre of gravity should not be more than 0. 46 b ahead of the apex of the step. The modification to the step planform makes little difference to the main spray characteristics, but increase in all-up-weight reduces wing, tailplane and <b>propeller</b> <b>clearances.</b> The effect of increase in load on the porpoising stability characterictics is to raise both limits, with a tendency for the upper limit to rise more rapidly, but less regularly, than the lower limit. The free-to-trim attitudes also rise with increase in all-up-weight. The planing efficiency of the hull increases with increase of load, especially at high speeds. There is evidence of a second resistance hump at high speeds and also of a critical variation of planing efficiency with attitude under simila...|$|R
5000|$|A {{shoulder}} wing (a category between high-wing and mid-wing) is a configuration whereby the wing is mounted {{near the top}} of the fuselage but not on the very top. It is so called because it sits on the [...] "shoulder" [...] of the fuselage, rather than on the pilot's shoulder. Shoulder-wings and high-wings share some characteristics, namely: they support a pendulous fuselage which requires no wing dihedral for stability; and, by comparison with a low-wing, a shoulder-wing's limited ground effect reduces float on landing. Compared to a low-wing, shoulder-wing and high-wing configurations give increased <b>propeller</b> <b>clearance</b> on multi-engined aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|The Kora was an all-wood {{aircraft}} and its constructors, Kortenbach & Rauh, were {{best known as}} furniture makers. It had a cantilever high wing with a constant chord centre section and tapered outer panels. Schempp-Hirth airbrakes opened over the upper, inner wing surfaces from mid-chord. The central pod was broad, housing a cockpit 1200 mm wide under a starboard-side opening, two piece canopy which reached from the wing leading edge almost to the nose. Instructor and pupil sat side-by-side, with the [...] Limbach SL 1700EC1 air cooled flat four piston engine behind them, where the wing became broader to allow <b>propeller</b> <b>clearance.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} of the D-40 {{was built}} around four longerons and divided into eight sections; the forward section was aluminium framed and covered as it housed the small diameter, [...] nine cylinder Salmson 9AD radial engine. In photographs {{the engine was}} uncowled though early plans show a Townend ring-type cowling; it was mounted as high as possible to provide <b>propeller</b> <b>clearance</b> on rough landing sites. Behind it the underside fell away rapidly to maximum depth at the wing; overall it was deep, flat sided and bottomed, with rounded decking. The longerons were ash in the more highly stressed forward and tail sections, with spruce elsewhere. Its single seat, open cockpit was over the wing trailing edge, with a small windscreen and long, faired headrest.|$|E
50|$|In a Kort nozzle, the inflow {{velocity}} is increased, reducing pressure. This lowers thrust and torque of the propeller. At {{the same}} time, a circulation occurs, {{resulting in an}} inward aimed force, that has a forward component. The duct therefore has a positive thrust. This is normally larger than the thrust reduction of the <b>propeller.</b> The small <b>clearance</b> between the <b>propeller</b> and duct reduces tip vortex, increasing efficiency.|$|R
50|$|The {{inverted}} {{gull wing}} was also {{developed in the}} 1930s and was chiefly used on single engine military aircraft with increasing powerful engines. Before contra-rotating propellers came into use, such powers required larger diameter <b>propellers</b> but <b>clearance</b> between the <b>propeller</b> tip and ground had to be maintained. Long landing gear legs are heavy, bulky, and weaker than their shorter counterparts. The Vought F4U Corsair, designed from the onset as a carrier-based fighter, not only had the largest propeller of any U.S. fighter, but was also expected to face rough landings aboard a pitching carrier deck. The inverted gull wing allowed the landing gear to be short and strong, and to retract straight back, improving internal wing space. An additional aerodynamic advantage was that the wing/fuselage connection is perpendicular and has inherently lower drag than any other connection.|$|R
2500|$|The Model 207 was a seven- {{and later}} eight-seat {{development}} of the 206, achieved by stretching the design further by [...] to allow space for more seats. The nose section was extended [...] by adding a constant-section nose baggage compartment between the passenger compartment and the engine firewall; the aft section was extended by [...] by inserting a constant-area section in the fuselage area just aft of the aft wing attach point. Thus the <b>propeller's</b> ground <b>clearance</b> was unaffected by the change (the nosewheel had moved forward the same distance as the propeller), but the tail moved aft relative to the mainwheel position, which made landing (without striking the tailskid on the runway) a greater challenge. [...] The move gave that airplane a larger turning radius, since the distance between mainwheels and nosewheel increased by [...] but the nosewheel's maximum allowed deflection was not increased.|$|R
50|$|The Prawn was a small, single-engined {{flying boat}} built by Parnall as a one-off to an Air Ministry contract. Single-engined flying boats are common, {{but the very}} unusual feature of the Prawn was that its engine was in the nose. There are obvious {{aerodynamic}} efficiencies, chiefly low drag, in putting the engine of a propeller driven landplane or floatplane in its nose, but flying boats sit low {{on the water and}} <b>propeller</b> <b>clearance</b> is a problem even when the aircraft is stationary. Once moving, spray also becomes a problem. The Prawn was built to see if these issues could be overcome. It combined two approaches: use a small propeller and make the engine mounting hinge so that the propeller could be raised above the prow when the aircraft was on the water.|$|E
5000|$|All three [...] Panhard-Levassor 12Cb V-12 engines were mounted {{midway between}} the wings {{in the central}} section on steel frames. The outer two were in tractor {{configuration}} and the central one, mounted above the fuselage, was a pusher. They had rectangular radiators in front of them. Each drove a four blade propeller. In order for the central propeller to clear the fuselage the central engine was mounted higher than the others and the chord of the upper wing reduced to provide a trailing edge cut-away for <b>propeller</b> <b>clearance.</b> Their three 530 L fuel tanks were in the fuselage forward and aft of the space for bombs, passengers or cargo; fuel was pumped from these to a feeder tank in the upper wing so that the engines could be gravity fed.|$|E
5000|$|With its {{parasol wing}} {{high above the}} hull, the three engines which were mounted in the upper surface were well clear of spray.

5000|$|Bush flying {{involves}} {{operations in}} rough terrain, necessitating bush planes to {{be equipped with}} tundra tires, floats, or skis. A bush plane should have good short take-off and landing capabilities. A typical bush plane will have wings on top of its fuselage {{to ensure that they}} do not make contact with any overgrowth in the landing area. They will normally have conventional [...] "tail-dragger" [...] landing gear as it has a greater aeronautic ability than tricycle landing gear, and is more suited to rough surfaces. [...] The increased upward angle of the taildragger configuration gives the <b>propeller</b> more <b>clearance</b> from the ground allowing it to avoid striking large rocks, logs and other debris that might cause damage. However tricycle gear ("Nose wheel") bushplanes are capable of landing almost anywhere a tail dragger can, provided it is equipped with suitable oversize high flotation tires and is correctly loaded.|$|R
50|$|The Model 207 was a seven- {{and later}} eight-seat {{development}} of the 206, achieved by stretching the design further by 45 in to allow space for more seats. The nose section was extended 18 in by adding a constant-section nose baggage compartment between the passenger compartment and the engine firewall; the aft section was extended by 27 in by inserting a constant-area section in the fuselage area just aft of the aft wing attach point. Thus the <b>propeller's</b> ground <b>clearance</b> was unaffected by the change (the nosewheel had moved forward the same distance as the propeller), but the tail moved aft relative to the mainwheel position, which made landing (without striking the tailskid on the runway) a greater challenge.

5000|$|The {{gull wing}} design {{found its way}} into {{seaplanes}} by the early 1930s. As engine power increased, so did the need for large propellers that could effectively convert power to thrust. The gull wing allowed designers to ensure adequate <b>propeller</b> tip <b>clearance</b> over the water by placing the engines on the highest point of the wing. The alternative was placing the engine on a pylon. Possibly the first flying boat to utilize the gull wing configuration was the Short Knuckleduster, which flew in 1933. The Dornier Do 26, a high-speed airliner and transport platform, of which 6 aircraft were built, flew in 1938. The configuration was also used on the US Navy's PBM Mariner and P5M Marlin maritime patrol aircraft. The emergence of long range, land-based jets in the 1950s and the subsequent demise of the seaplane prevented widespread use of the gull wing, although it was still used in some post-war designs, like Beriev Be-12 Chaika (the name means 'the gull' in Russian).|$|R
5000|$|The taildragger {{arrangement}} was common {{during the early}} propeller era, as it allows more room for <b>propeller</b> <b>clearance.</b> Most modern aircraft have tricycle undercarriages. Taildraggers are considered harder to land and take off (because the arrangement is usually unstable, that is, a small deviation from straight-line travel will tend to increase rather than correct itself), and usually require special pilot training. Sometimes a small tail wheel or skid is added to aircraft with tricycle undercarriage, in case of tail strikes during take-off. Concorde, for instance, had a retractable tail [...] "bumper" [...] wheel, as delta winged aircraft need a high angle when taking off. Both Boeing'a largest WW II bomber, the B-29 Superfortress and the 1960s-introduction Boeing 727 trijet airliner each have a retractable tail bumper. Some aircraft with retractable conventional landing gear have a fixed tailwheel, which generates minimal drag (since most of the airflow past the tailwheel has been blanketed by the fuselage) and even improves yaw stability in some cases.Another arrangement sometimes used is central main and nose gear with outriggers on the wings. This may be done {{where there is no}} convenient location on either side to attach the main undercarriage or to store it when retracted. Examples include the Lockheed U-2 spy plane and the Harrier Jump Jet.|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} of ground influence on airplanes has recently attracted some attention {{in view of}} the claims made by certain designers that the landing speed of their airplanes is much decreased by an increase in lift coefficient due to the proximity of the ground in landing. The results of wind tunnel tests indicate that ground effect is not entirely beneficial. It decreases the landing speed and cushions the landing shock somewhat. However, it does so at the expense of an increased length of preliminary skimming over the ground. By decreasing the drag and increasing the lift, it lengthens the distance necessary for the airplane to travel before losing enough speed to land. On the other hand, its influence is helpful in taking off, {{especially in the case of}} flying boats with their low-lying wings. In the conventional tractor airplane, the height of the wings above the ground is determined largely by <b>propeller</b> <b>clearance.</b> However, a small low-speed airplane like the Pischoff and large low-speed commercial aircraft with engines between wings can utilize ground influence to good advantage...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate how hull forces and pressure are influenced by small <b>propeller</b> tip <b>clearance</b> by creating a setup where systematic variation of tip clearance could be achieved at similar propeller conditions; in this study, <b>clearances</b> between the <b>propeller</b> tip and a generic hull with tunnel configuration were 0. 7 %D P, 5 %D P, and 20 %D P. Simulations were performed using a scale resolved PANS approach, combined with cavitation modelling considering the fluid as a mixture and incorporating mass transfer source terms. The predicted impact on hull pressure is very large, with the maximum amplitude differing an order of magnitude between the small clearance case and the one with normal clearance. More important, however, is probably the forces exerted on the hull plate, and here the difference is much less; the standard deviation of pressure variation differs by a factor that does not exceed two. However, the higher order blade passing frequencies are much more prominent in the case with small clearance, presumably due to a complex behaviour of the tip vortex along the hull plate...|$|R
