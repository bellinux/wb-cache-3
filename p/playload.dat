50|$|A {{graphene}} ‘flying carpet’ {{was demonstrated}} to deliver two anti-cancer drugs sequentially to the lung tumor cells (A549 cell) in a mouse model. Doxorubicin (DOX) is embedded onto the graphene sheet, while the molecules of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) {{are linked to}} the nanostructure via short peptide chains. Injected intravenously, the graphene strips with the drug <b>playload</b> preferentially concentrate to the cancer cells due to common blood vessel leakage around the tumor. Receptors on the cancer cell membrane bind TRAIL and cell surface enzymes clip the peptide thus release the drug onto the cell surface. Without the bulky TRAIL, the graphene strips with the embedded DOX are swallowed into the cells. The intracellular acidic environment promotes DOX’s release from graphene. TRAIL on the cell surface triggers the apoptosis while DOX attacks the nucleus. These two drugs work synergistically and were found to be more effective than either drug alone.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} host load trace playback, a {{new technique}} for generating a background workload from a trace of the Unix load average that results in realistic and repeatable CPU contention behavior. Such workloads are invaluable for evaluating various forms of distributed middleware, including resource prediction systems and application-level schedulers. We describe the technique and then evaluate a tool, <b>playload,</b> that implements it. <b>Playload</b> faithfully reproduces workloads from traces on the four platforms on which we have evaluated it. Both <b>playload</b> and a large set of host load traces are publicly available from the web at the following URL: [URL] 1 Introduction Being able to generate a realistic and repeatable background CPU workload is a necessary prerequisite to evaluating systems such as application-level schedulers [3], dynamic load balancers [1, 12], distributed soft real-time systems [4], and resource prediction systems [7, [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a blind decoding watermarking scheme that {{takes advantage of}} two basic properties of the Fourier transform: The image information is transformed into frequency bands centered around {{the origin of the}} coordinate system and the image information, the latter beeing independent from shifts in the original image. (i. e. pixel domain). These properties are exploited to embed a watermark that is inherently robust against translation an rotation in the pixel domain and shows considerable robustness against cropping and scaling as well. The amplitude part of the Fourier representation of the image is divided into rings, and each ring is subdivided into sections. A pair of sections is used to embed one bit of watermark information with the bit value being represented´by a predifined difference between the mean power values of the sections. The <b>playload</b> of the presented watermarking scheme strongly depends {{on the size of the}} image. Tests based on a leightweights implementation of the presented scheme were run with a watermark <b>playload</b> of 16 bits for an image of 512 by 512 pixels...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{describes}} the Rosetta Lander named Philae and introduces its complement of scientific instruments. Philae was launched aboard the European Space Agency Rosetta spacecraft on 02 March 2004 {{and is expected}} to land and operate on the nucleus of 67 /Churyumov-Gerasimenko at a distance of about 3 AU from the Sun. Its overall mass is ~ 98 kg (plus the support systems remaining on the Orbiter), including its scientific <b>playload</b> of ~ 27 kg. It will operate aufomously, using the Rosetta Orbiter as a communication relay to Earth. The scientific goals of its experiments focus on elemental, isotopic, moleculer and mineralogical of the cometary material, the characterization of physical properties of the surface and subsurface material, the large-scale structure and the magnetic and plasma environment of the nucleus. In particular,sub-surface and surface samples will be acquired and sequentially analyzed by a suite of instruments. Measurements will be performed primarily during descent and along the first five days following touch-down. Philae is designed to also operate on a long time-scale, to monitor the evolution of the nucleus properties. Philae is a very integrated project at system, science and management levels, provided by an international consortium. The Philae experiments have the potential of providing unique scientific outcomes, complementing by in situ ground truth the Rosetta Orbiter investigations...|$|E
40|$|Activatable cell {{penetrating}} peptides (ACPPs) are polycationic cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) whose cellular uptake is minimized by a polyanionic inhibitory {{domain and}} then restored upon proteolysis of the peptide linker connecting the polyanionic and polycationic domains. Local activity of proteases {{able to cut}} the linker causes amplified retention in tissues and uptake into cells. This ACPP platform has been specifically designed to meet 3 major criteria for contrast and therapeutic agent development. The first criterion was to target a wide spread disease process and mechanism that is inherent to cancer progression, in this case, matrix metalloprotease activity. Secondly, the platform was designed with an amplification mechanism that can deliver multiple molecules per target; {{in this case the}} targets are cancer proteases. Thirdly, the ACPP platform is not limited to a single enzyme target, imaging modality, or therapeutic <b>playload.</b> We show the validation of the ACPP concept from tissue culture to systemic administration in tumor bearing mice. ACPPs have enhanced biodistribution compared to the CPP counterpart and they yield MMP dependent contrast in multiple tumors and in metastases. ACPPs can be conjugated to macromolecular weight carriers to further enhance the biodistribution profile by prolonging plasma half-life resulting in enhanced tumor uptake and providing clinically significant contrast as an 111 -In radiotracer. The second part of the dissertation focuses on translation from imaging agents into therapeutic agents. We describe the challenges of cell penetration, drug conjugation, stability, and the resulting animal testing using doxorubicin conjugated dendrimers that yielded some promising results. Lastly, we describe the simple attachment of ACPPs to clinically approved therapeutic nanoparticles. This approach has resulted in ACPP based targeted doxorubicin liposomes that have significant anti-tumor activity compared to untargeted liposomes. We conclude that because of preclinical successes, ACPPs have significant potential {{in the development of a}} targeting portfolio of imaging and therapeutic agents that could one day be useful in the clini...|$|E
