50|$|In galactosemic patients, the {{accumulation}} of galactose becomes the substrate for enzymes that catalyze the polyol pathway of carbohydrate metabolism. The first reaction of this pathway is the reduction of aldoses, types of sugars including galactose, to sugar alcohols. Recent data suggests that aldose reductase is the enzyme responsible for the primary stage of this pathway. Therefore, aldose reductase reduces galactose to its sugar alcohol form, galactitol. Galactitol, however, is not a suitable substrate for the next enzyme in the polyol pathway, <b>polyol</b> <b>dehydrogenase.</b> Thus, galactitol accumulates in body tissues and is excreted in the urine of galactosemic patients. Accumulation of galactitol {{has been attributed to}} many of the negative effects of galactosemia, and high concentrations of galactitol have been found in people with classic galactosemia (GALT deficiency or Galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase deficiency), galactokinase deficiency, and epimerase deficiency.|$|E

50|$|In galactosemic cataracts, osmotic {{swelling}} of the lens epithelial cells (LEC) occurs. Osmosis is the movement of water from areas of low particle concentration to areas of high particle concentration, to establish equilibrium. Researchers concluded that this osmotic swelling must {{be the result of}} an accumulation of abnormal metabolites or electrolytes in the lens. Ruth Van Heyningen was the first to discover that the lens's retention of dulcitol, synonymous for galactitol, induces this osmotic swelling in the galactosemic cataract. However, galactose concentration must be fairly high before the enzyme, aldose reductase, will convert significant amounts of the sugar to its galactitol form. As it turns out, the lens is a favorable site for galactose accumulation. The lens phosphorylates galactose at a relatively slow pace in comparison to other tissues. This factor, in combination with the low activity of galactose-metabolizing enzymes in galactosemic patients, allows for the accumulation of galactose in the lens. Aldose reductase is able to dip into this galactose reservoir and synthesize significant amounts of galactitol. As is mentioned above, galactitol is not a suitable substrate for the enzyme, <b>polyol</b> <b>dehydrogenase,</b> which catalyzes {{the next step in the}} carbohydrate metabolic cycle. Thus, the sugar alcohol idly begins to accumulate in the lens.|$|E

40|$|Adult Upis ceramboides do {{not survive}} {{freezing}} {{in the summer}} but tolerate freezing to − 60 °C in midwinter. The accumulation of two cryoprotective polyols, sorbitol and threitol, is integral to the extraordinary cold-hardiness of this beetle. U. ceramboides are the only animals known to accumulate high concentrations of threitol; however, the biosynthetic pathway has not been studied. A series of 13 C-labeled compounds was employed to investigate this biosynthetic pathway using 13 C{ 1 H} NMR spectroscopy. In vivo metabolism of 13 C-labeled glucose isotopomers demonstrates that C- 3 —C- 6 of glucose become C- 1 —C- 4 of threitol. This labeling pattern is expected for 4 -carbon saccharides arising from the pentose phosphate pathway. In vitro experiments show that threitol is synthesized from erythrose 4 -phosphate, a C 4 intermediate in the PPP. Erythrose 4 -phosphate is epimerized and/or isomerized to threose 4 -phosphate, which is subsequently reduced by a NADPH-dependent <b>polyol</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> and dephosphorylated by a sugar phosphatase to form threitol.

40|$|A {{kinetic model}} for xylose {{catabolism}} in Aspergillus is proposed. From a thermodynamic analysis {{it was found}} that the intermediate xylitol will accumulate during xylose catabolism. Use of the kinetic model allowed metabolic control analysis (MCA) of the xylose catabolic pathway to be carried out, and flux control was shown to be dependent on the metabolite levels. Due to thermodynamic constraints, flux control may reside at the first step in the pathway, i. e., at the xylose reductase, even when the intracellular xylitol concentration is high. On the basis of the kinetic analysis, the general dogma specifying that flux control often resides at the step following an intermediate present at high concentrations was, therefore, shown not to hold.

Gluconobacter species also oxidize sugars and sugar acids and uniquely accumulate two different keto-d-gluconates, 2 -keto-d-gluconate and 5 -keto-d-gluconate, in the culture medium by the oxidation of d-gluconate. However, there are still many controversies regarding their enzyme systems, especially on d-sorbitol and also d-gluconate oxidations. Recently, pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent quinoprotein d-arabitol dehydrogenase and d-sorbitol dehydrogenase have been purified from G. suboxydans, both of which have similar and broad substrate specificity towards several different polyols. In this study, both quinoproteins were shown to be identical based on their immuno-cross-reactivity and also on gene disruption and were suggested to be the same as the previously isolated glycerol dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 99. 22). Thus, glycerol dehydrogenase is the major <b>polyol</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> involved in the oxidation of almost all sugar alcohols in Gluconobacter sp. In addition, the so-called quinoprotein glycerol dehydrogenase was also uniquely shown to oxidize d-gluconate, which was completely different from flavoprotein d-gluconate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 99. 3), which is involved in the production of 2 -keto-d-gluconate. The gene disruption experiment and the reconstitution system of the purified enzyme in this study clearly showed that the production of 5 -keto-d-gluconate in G. suboxydans is solely dependent on the quinoprotein glycerol dehydrogenase...|$|E
40|$|Two large {{gene and}} protein superfamilies, SDR and MDR (short- and medium-chain dehydrogenases/reductases), were {{originally}} defined from analysis {{of alcohol and}} <b>polyol</b> <b>dehydrogenases.</b> The superfamilies contain minimally 82 and 25 genes, respectively, in humans, minimally 324 and 86 enzyme families when known lines in other organisms are also included, and over 47, 000 and 15, 000 variants in existing sequence data bank entries. SDR enzymes have one-domain subunits without metal and MDR two-domain subunits without or with zinc, and these three lines appear to have emerged in that order from the universal cellular ancestor. This is compatible with their molecular architectures, present multiplicity, and overall distribution in the kingdoms of life, with SDR also of viral occurrence. An MDR-zinc, when present, is often, but not always, catalytic. It appears also to have a structural role in inter-domain interactions, coenzyme binding and substrate pocket formation, as supported by domain variability ratios and ligand positions. Differences among structural and catalytic zinc ions may be relative and involve several states. Combined, the comparisons trace evolutionary properties of huge superfamilies, with partially redundant enzymes in cellular redox functions...|$|R
40|$|Sorbitol {{dehydrogenase}} from sheep liver shows {{similarities to}} mammalian and yeast alcohol dehydrogenases. Comparisons based on peptides from segments of sorbitol dehydrogenase reveal that homologous regions with 38 % identity include two ligands to the active site zinc atom in liver alcohol dehydrogenase, {{as well as}} further important residues. Similarities in in other regions are less extensive, exactly as they are between different alcohol dehydrogenases. In all aspects, sorbitol dehydrogenase appears as a typical member of the alcohol dehydrogenase family. On the other hand, alcohol dehydrogenase from Drosophila, which has a shorter subunit, is not closely related to either of these enzymes, except for a region that probably corresponds to {{the first part of}} the coenzyme binding domain in many dehydrogenases. Instead, Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase in its supposed catalytic region shows similarities toward Klebsiella ribitol dehydrogenase, which also has a small subunit. It may be concluded that both alcohol and <b>polyol</b> <b>dehydrogenases</b> show two types of protein subunit, reflecting an early subdivision of polypeptide types into "long" and "short" subunits rather than into different enzymatic specificities or quaternary structures. The relationships explain known properties of all these enzymes and provide insight into functional mechanisms and evolutionary interpretations...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{of the structure of}} class II human liver alcohol dehydrogenase (alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1. 1. 1. 1) (containing pi subunits) with those of the human class I isozymes (containing alpha, beta, and gamma subunits) reveals differences at about 40 % of all positions. Variations are large for active-site regions, the segment around the second zinc atom, and for segments involved in subunit interactions. The two classes of alcohol dehydrogenase have diverged to exhibit structural differences to about half the extent of those between alcohol and <b>polyol</b> <b>dehydrogenases.</b> Hence, the two classes of alcohol dehydrogenase represent steps in enzyme rather than isozyme divergence. An evolutionary scheme that relates different types of zinc-containing mammalian dehydrogenases to one another encompasses at least three levels of gene duplication subsequent to the early step(s) of assembly of building unit(s). The first level of duplication results in the formation of now clearly different enzymes. The second level concerns the various classes of alcohol dehydrogenase, forming steps between typical enzymes and isozymes. The third level encompasses recent and multiple duplications in isozyme evolution of alcohol dehydrogenases. This scheme, linking zinc-containing dehydrogenases at different levels, resembles that in other protein families and reflects general patterns in protein relationships...|$|R
