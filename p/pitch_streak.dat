40|$|A novel {{approach}} for pitch track correction and music-speech classification is proposed {{in order to}} improve the performance of the speech segregation system. The proposed pitch track correction method adjusts unreliable pitch estimates from adjacent reliable pitch streaks, in contrast to the previous approach using a single <b>pitch</b> <b>streak</b> which is the longest among the reliable pitch streaks in a sentence. The proposed music and speech classification method finds continuous pitch streaks of the mixture, and labels each streak as music-dominant or speech-dominant based on the observation that music pitch seldom changes in a short-time period whereas speech pitch fluctuates a lot. The speech segregation results for mixtures of speech and various competing sound sources demonstrated that the proposed methods are superior to the conventional method, especially for mixtures of speech and music signals. close...|$|E
40|$|This article {{proposes a}} novel speech and sound {{segregation}} framework incorporating a technique for correcting {{a series of}} pitch periods based on particle filtering. The conventional pitch track correction method finds the peak locations of the autocorrelation functions to estimate the pitch period, and only the longest reliable <b>pitch</b> <b>streak</b> is used to correct unreliable pitch tracks. Especially in noisy environments, {{it is hard to}} find long and reliable pitch streaks, resulting in the degradation of the speech segregation performance. The proposed algorithm based on particle filtering considers all the reliable pitch streaks rather than the longest one and smoothly connects the scattered pitch streaks. To apply the particle filtering algorithm to pitch track correction, the importance weight computation to account for the degree of matchness of the found pitch to the individual spectro-temporal components is also proposed. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by the results of speech segregation experiments for the mixtures of speech and various noise sources in various mixing signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The evaluation measures were SNR, energy loss ratio, and noise residue ratio of the segregated speech, and all these measures showed that the proposed segregation method achieved superior performance compared to the conventional approach. close 0...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Machine {{vision is}} widely used in {{scientific}} areas and non-wood using industries, but the extreme variability of wood has limited its adoption by forest products industries. However, it is now becoming {{a key factor in}} further automation of the forest products industry. As {{a very important part of}} machine vision, developing image segmentation algorithms that can be used for wood products is an ambitious undertaking. The focus of this research was to adapt existing and develop some new segmentation algorithms which could be used to detect defects on veneer surfaces. Nine algorithms covering three segmentation technique categories were explored. Three existing edge detection algorithms were modified for use on veneer images, and four existing thresholding algorithms were adapted in both global and local versions. Two new region extraction algorithms were developed specifically for defect detection on veneer surfaces. The performances of these nine algorithms were tested and compared under the combinations of two camera resolutions (5 -bit and 8 -bit), three color spaces (RGB, Lab, and gray-scale), and seven surface features (clear wood, blue stain, loose knot, pitch pocket, <b>pitch</b> <b>streak,</b> tight knot, and wane). Ten sample images for each of seven surface features on Douglas-fir veneer [Pseudotsuga menziesii] were used. Ten measures were proposed for performance evaluation. A multi-factor factorial ANOVA was used in the performance tests and comparisons. The best combinations of camera resolution and color space for each of the algorithms were determined. The 5 -bit and 8 -bit camera resolutions were not significantly different for the three edge detection and two region extraction algorithms, but the 8 -bit camera resolution was better for all but one of the thresholding algorithms. That exception was the global Otsu thresholding algorithm, for which the 5 -bit camera resolution was better. The RGB color space was the best for all algorithms. Overall, the two region extraction algorithms were the best. Under the best combination of factors, those two algorithms provided the highest defect detection accuracies of 91...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} {{became clear}} after the measurements of r 0 and MCs, {{the observations of}} defects such as knots, <b>pitch</b> <b>streaks,</b> compressionwood in wetwood, and the drying tests of wetwood of Todomatsu sawed square blocks: 1) Knots and <b>pitch</b> <b>streaks</b> were often observed {{in association with the}} wetwood of Todomatsu lumber. 2) The high specific gravity of the wetwood in a former report was due to natural defects such as knots, <b>pitch</b> <b>streaks</b> which had high specific gravities. In case the wetwood included the defects, the specific gravity of wetwood increased. 3) A significant relationship was not recognized between compressionwood and wet wood. No relationship between specific gravities and compressionwood in wetwood containing lumber could not be established, as stated in a previous report. 4) Very little difference was recognized in ovendry specific gravity between samples with wetwood and without wetwood. However, wetwood with a low drying rate tended to have a higher specific gravity. 5) The low drying rate of the lumber with wetwood and the residual water in it after its drying seemed to be due to the existence of natural defects and their undesirable locations for drying in the lumber where they disturbed moisture movement toward the surface of lumber during the drying process. 6) The lumber with wetwood, however, did not have a low drying rate if it contained natural defects and were positioned near the surface of lumber. The following conclusion was obtained from the experiments: The low drying rate of wetwood was caused basically by the existence of knots and/or <b>pitch</b> <b>streaks</b> and their undesirable locations in lumber rather than by the difference in quality between the wetwood and the normal wood. If the defects are located between the surface of lumber and the wet parts. the defects worked as a barrier and did not allow the movement of the water or water vapor toward the surface, and so the water remained in the lumber. トドマツ水食い材を人工乾燥したあと，しばしば材内に異常に多い残留水分が残ることがあり木材加工上の問題となっている。乾燥後の残留水分の原因について水食い材の欠点の観察および乾燥試験を通して検討した。木材中に水食いがあれば必ず乾燥後の材内に異常に多い残留水分が存在するとも限らない。また水食いの箇所は材内の節，樹脂条（やにすじ）の位置と隣接して存在していた。これらのことから，「残留水分はトドマツの欠点，特に節と樹脂条（やにすじ）の存在と関係が深く，木材中のこれら欠点が水分の木材表面への移動，乾燥を妨げる位置に存在した場合に，これら欠点が水分移動を遮るバリアとして働き，その部分が蓄積され残留水分が多くなる」という結論が得られた...|$|R

500|$|After one-hitting Boston on May 2, 1904, Philadelphia Athletics pitcher Rube Waddell taunted Young to {{face him}} {{so that he could}} repeat his {{performance}} against Boston's ace. Three days later, Young pitched a perfect game against Waddell and the Athletics. It was the first perfect game in American League history. Waddell was the 27th and last batter, and when he flied out, Young shouted, [...] "How do you like that, you hayseed?" [...] Waddell had picked an inauspicious time to issue his challenge. Young's perfect game was the centerpiece of a <b>pitching</b> <b>streak.</b> Young set major league records for the most consecutive scoreless innings pitched and the most consecutive innings without allowing a hit; the latter record still stands at 25.1 innings, or 76 hitless batters. Even after allowing a hit, Young's scoreless streak reached a then-record 45 shutout innings. Before Young, only two pitchers had thrown perfect games. This occurred in 1880, when Lee Richmond and John Montgomery Ward pitched perfect games within five days of each other, although under somewhat different rules: the front edge of the pitcher's box was only [...] from home base (the modern release point is about [...] farther away); walks required eight balls; and pitchers were obliged to throw side-armed. Young's perfect game was the first under the modern rules established in 1893. One year later, on July 4, 1905, Rube Waddell beat Young and the Americans, 42, in a 20-inning matchup. Young pitched 13 consecutive scoreless innings before he gave up a pair of unearned runs in the final inning. Young did not walk a batter and was later quoted: [...] "For my part, I think it was the greatest game of ball I ever took part in."

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Raw {{material}} costs and limited material availability and quality have created significant {{interest in and}} opportunities {{for the application of}} nondestructive evaluation techniques to improve wood processing technologies. The incentives come from the desire to 1) manufacture the highest valued product, 2) conserve the amount of raw material used, 3) use lower priced and often, lower quality raw materials, and 4) meet future demands for wood products in an economy with stark contrasts of a declining wood supply and increasing pressure from environmental concerns. Developing appropriate non-destructive evaluation techniques requires research and development of new concepts and extending the usability of known principles. Dielectrics is one such technique that offers a number of potential applications in areas such as moisture detection, drying and re-drying, grading and sorting, defect detection, curing and gluing of engineered products, repairing and patching of laminated panel products, monitoring of adhesive curing, and manufacturing of aligned fiber products. The objective of this research was to fill the void in knowledge that existed about the dielectric properties of typical features found on Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) wood. Features investigated included clearwood, various sizes of loose and tight knots, knot holes, <b>pitch</b> pockets, <b>pitch</b> <b>streaks,</b> and blue stain. The dielectric constant and loss tangent were analyzed on a global (whole-feature) basis under a range of excitation frequencies and moisture content conditions typically found in wood processing. This research required the development of specialized instrumentation, because measuring the dielectric properties of wood over a broad full range of moisture and excitation frequency conditions is particularly challenging. Results suggested that there are optimal combinations of moisture and excitation frequencies suitable for applications where it is necessary to distinguish between certain wood features. Simple classifications of features measured at such optimal working conditions are presented in addition to global data on the expected dielectric properties of each feature. These results form a fundamental basis for the development of future stand-alone, dielectric-based applications or applications using dielectric-based in conjunction with and other sensing methods...|$|R
