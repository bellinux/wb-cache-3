500|$|By 2:30pm the {{shooting}} {{from the house}} had ceased. One of the detectives present walked close {{to the wall and}} <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> before retreating. Other police officers, and some of the soldiers, came out and waited for the men to exit. None did, and as part of the roof collapsed, it was clear to onlookers that the men were both dead; the fire brigade was allowed to start extinguishing the fire. At 2:40 Churchill left the scene, at about the time the Royal Horse Artillery arrived with two 13-pounder field artillery pieces. When the firemen entered the property to douse the flames, they soon located Sokoloff's body, which was extracted. A wall collapsed on a group of five [...] firemen, who were all taken to the London Hospital. One of the men, Superintendent Charles Pearson, had a fractured spine; he died six months after the siege {{as a result of his}} injuries. After shoring up the building, the firemen resumed their search of the premises. At around 6:30pm the second body—that of Svaars—was found; it was taken to the mortuary.|$|E
60|$|The girl <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> {{and stood}} {{just inside the}} room.|$|E
60|$|At the summons Matt McCarthy {{pulled the}} latch-string, <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> {{and closed it}} {{carefully}} behind him.|$|E
50|$|A {{struggle}} ensues as Reid {{tries to}} <b>push</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> and <b>the</b> officer attempts to keep <b>the</b> <b>door</b> closed. Days steps back, and Reid <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> gets up, and exits {{the car with}} his hands at chest level. Days backs up and fires as Reid exits the vehicle. Reid reacts to the shots by moving his hands upwards. Worley fires one shot, and Reid is killed. Reid was unarmed.|$|R
60|$|Upon this {{pleasant}} conference Cliff Belden unexpectedly burst. <b>Pushing</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> with a slam, he confronted Berrie {{with dark}} and angry face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Those are the {{coils of}} cable, Hugh; they have blocked us in. Go on {{striking}} that light; we can't <b>push</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good." [...] Reinhart <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> for him. [...] "You join your {{directional}} staff. I'll proceed {{toward the}} tunnel entrance." ...|$|E
60|$|He fitted {{the key in}} {{the lock}} and <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open.</b> Mr. Lynn took one step forward and drew back hurriedly.|$|E
60|$|They {{had stopped}} before {{an old house}} with a blind, deserted look, that stood by itself on the wall; Harz <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{walked to}} <b>the</b> kitchen, and, <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> softly, went in. Rosa Jelks, {{who was sitting}} down reading, put aside her book and smiled welcome.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, wretched one!" [...] {{cried the}} Talisman, [...] "oh, wretched one! Fly {{while there is}} yet time--fly, for thy doom is near! Do not <b>push</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> for it is not locked!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will know}} the house by its tumbledown portico and the tattered red flag that surmounts it. Once there, <b>push</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> and walk in boldly. Then ask to speak with citizen Robespierre." ...|$|R
6000|$|But Tom Madison {{was in a}} mood {{to which}} her female nature cowered. He <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> saying authoritatively, 'Tell me how he is!' ...|$|E
60|$|But she got {{no time to}} gasp {{anything}} more, for the impatient {{captain had}} <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> without knocking, {{and stood in the}} middle of the widow's kitchen.|$|E
60|$|The man {{coughed and}} smiled, and then 'e <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> gently and came in, {{and stood there}} {{fingering}} 'is beard as though 'e didn't know wot to say.|$|E
60|$|With {{the sound}} of that word {{offending}} my ears I saw the girl extend her arm, <b>push</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> a little way and glide in. I saw plainly that movement, the hand put out in advance with the gesture of a sleep-walker.|$|R
60|$|I {{threw my}} whole weight against <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> once, twice, thrice. It groaned on its hinges, {{but that was}} all. I tried to obtain a {{purchase}} upon the floor, and thereby <b>push</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open.</b> But <b>the</b> flooring was slippery, {{and this was a}} failure.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{that may}} be so, and it mayn't. Now, all ready. Step forward, George Jackson. And mind, don't you hurry--come mighty slow. If there's anybody with you, let him keep back--if he shows himself he'll be shot. Come along now. Come slow; <b>push</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> yourself--just enough to squeeze in, d' you hear?" ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{this order}} they filed aboard softly, arrived at Noakes's den, the {{quartermaster}} <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> and the lantern revealed the three desperadoes {{sitting on the}} floor. Capt. Ned said: ...|$|E
60|$|Obeying {{the least}} signal with ready and timorous acquiescence, she <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> but {{instantly}} recoiled with terror. It was a charnel house, half filled with dry skulls and bones.|$|E
60|$|Conger <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open.</b> Warm air rushed around him. Lora was {{drinking}} hot chocolate, with whipped cream. She {{looked up in}} surprise as he slid into the seat beside her.|$|E
5000|$|... "Find a comfy {{place to}} sit, {{as quiet as}} a mouse, and listen to {{a story about a}} little house. [...] Just in the corner, down by the floor, in Hotch Potch House there's a tiny brown <b>door.</b> [...] <b>Push</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> and step right through - inside the Mouse House there's a story for you!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Metsu {{left his}} post as {{the manager of}} the Senegal {{national}} team in 2002, at the height of differences with the country's football officials. When asked if he was leaving the continent a frustrated man he replied, [...] "No, never! I learnt life here. I honed my skills as a coach here. I made a name here and <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>open</b> to <b>the</b> wide world." ...|$|R
50|$|Cage traps {{are also}} used in muskrat trapping. A cage trap {{is set in a}} runway and <b>the</b> muskrat <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> which is at a 45 degrees. Once the muskrat enters the cage trap the other side is closed with another door at 45 degrees. The muskrat drowns in the trap which is set under water. No bait is necessary, as the trap is set in a muskrat runway.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all right," [...] he said, {{throwing}} {{himself down}} in a chair. [...] "It was that fool of a dog. He had <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open.</b> I don't know how I came to forget to lock it." ...|$|E
60|$|It turned, and he <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> cautiously. He {{knew he was}} {{treading}} on dangerous {{ground and}} was running a great risk. Yet a strange courage seemed to have come over him, {{and he was not}} one bit nervous.|$|E
60|$|He <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> {{slowly and}} started as it creaked. Nothing {{happening}} he pushed again, and standing just inside saw, {{by a small}} ewer silhouetted against the casement, {{that he was in}} a bedroom. He listened for the sound of breathing, but in vain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why don’t {{they speak}} up?" [...] he said crossly, as a low, indistinct murmuring reached him. He {{strained}} his ears intently, {{but could not}} catch anything, and losing all patience, {{was just about to}} <b>push</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> and peep in when he heard a roar of laughter. Peal upon peal sounded until the bar shook with it, and an expression of peace and rest came over his face as he pictured the scene inside.|$|R
60|$|Larry <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> front <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> grunting. He set his {{briefcase}} {{down and took}} off his hat. Then he saw Bob for the first time.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{show you}} round," [...] said Jim, merrily; and, <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> he led <b>the</b> {{way into the}} hall. I {{remember}} the high, oak- panelled walls, with the heads of deer jutting out, and a single white bust, which sent my heart into my mouth, in the corner. Many rooms opened out of this, and we wandered {{from one to the}} other--the kitchens, the still-room, the morning-room, the dining-room, all filled with the same choking smell of dust and of mildew.|$|R
60|$|He <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> {{and after}} {{surveying}} {{the patient with}} a benevolent smile triumphantly held up a collar and tie for his inspection and threw them on the bed. Then he disappeared hastily and, closing the door, turned {{the key in the}} lock.|$|E
60|$|Ruth {{struggled}} to reply, but ineffectually. Slowly, and as though with some foreboding of danger, the footsteps came nearer and nearer. An unseen hand cautiously <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open.</b> Isaac stood upon the threshold, peering anxiously into the room. The inspector turned and faced him.|$|E
60|$|He <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> as {{he called}} to her, but did not return into the room, or wait to be lighted down the narrow stairs. He {{was at the bottom}} when she began to descend, and was in the street before she could take his arm.|$|E
60|$|He listened. Not a sound. As {{he turned}} the key with a {{trembling}} hand, and <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> softly <b>open</b> with his knee, a monstrous fear beset his mind.|$|R
60|$|With an unceremonious kick he <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> further <b>open</b> {{and strode}} in. A woman was {{standing}} in the dimly lighted passage. As the stranger walked in she bobbed him a respectful curtsey.|$|R
50|$|However, they realise they cannot {{leave as}} without the rain, {{they have no}} {{physical}} form. Instead they resolve to drag the Unknown into the light beyond <b>the</b> <b>door</b> at <b>the</b> cost of trapping themselves {{in the world of}} night. After they close <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> <b>the</b> Unknown <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> as he dies and collapses onto the boy, pinning him. Unable to free him, the girl abandons him and heads straight to his home. There she yells at his window in hopes to awaken him. She succeeds, but as the boy becomes visible, the girl is left trapped and alone.|$|R
