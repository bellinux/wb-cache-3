40|$|ObjectivesWe report our 23 -year {{experience}} with leaflet and annular remodeling techniques in {{infants and children}} with congenital mitral valve insufficiency from lesions with restricted leaflet motion (type III). MethodsA review of the medical records, including follow-up echocardiographic studies of 49 children, aged 20 days to 14 years, was performed. These children were divided into age groups of 0 to < 1 year (n =  4; mean age, 3. 2 ± 1. 2 months), 1 to 5 years (n =  17; mean age, 2. 8 ± 1. 6 years), and older than 5 to 15 years (n =  28; mean age, 12. 3 ± 2. 5 years). All had severe mitral insufficiency from type III Carpentier’s functional classification of mitral valve lesion. Restricted leaflet motion was secondary to commissural fusion in 17 children, thickened leaflets in 9, short chordae in 6, matted chordae in 2, papillary muscle hypoplasia in 3, a <b>parachute</b> <b>valve</b> in 11, and a hammock valve in 1. Various repair strategies were applied. ResultsThe perioperative course was unremarkable. The mean follow-up duration was 11. 5 ± 1. 8 years. A 2 -year-old patient with a <b>parachute</b> <b>valve</b> underwent mitral valve replacement 2 years after the initial repair. She died 8 years later of noncardiac causes. The freedom from reoperation rate was 100 % at 30 days and 1 year and 97. 9 % at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years. The actuarial survival rate was 100 % at 30 days, 1 year, and 5 years and 95. 96 % at 10, 15, and 20 years. ConclusionsMitral valve reconstruction of congenital mitral insufficiency from restricted leaflet motion in infants and children using various modified repair techniques tailored to the presenting valve morphology can be successfully performed in children with excellent long-term results...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{developed}} technologies allow {{aortic valve}} implantation off-pump in a beating heart. In this procedure, the native, stenotic aortic valve is not removed, but simply crushed by a pressure balloon {{mounted on a}} percutaneous catheter. Removal of the native aortic cusps before valve replacement may {{reduce the incidence of}} annular or cuspal calcium embolization and late perivalvular leaks and increase implantable valve size. However, a temporary valve system in the ascending aorta may be necessary to maintain hemodynamic stability by reducing acute aortic regurgitation and left ventricular volume overload. This study evaluates the hemodynamic effects of a wire-mounted, monoleaflet, temporary valve apparatus in a mechanical cardiovascular simulator. Aortic flow, systemic pressure and left ventricular pressure were continuously monitored. An intraluminal camera obtained real-time proximal and distal images of the valve in operation. Insertion of the <b>parachute</b> <b>valve</b> in the simulator increased diastolic pressure from 7 to 38 mm Hg. Cardiac output increased from 2. 08 to 4. 66 L/min and regurgitant volume decreased from 65 to 23 mL.

40|$|ObjectiveIn “true” <b>parachute</b> mitral <b>valve,</b> {{mitral valve}} chordae insert into one {{papillary}} muscle. In parachute-like asymmetric mitral valve, {{most or all}} chordal attachments are to one papillary muscle. This study compared morphologic features, associated lesions, and palliation strategies of the two <b>parachute</b> mitral <b>valve</b> and dominant papillary muscle types and examined interventions and midterm outcomes in patients with biventricular circulation. MethodsEchocardiography and autopsy databases were reviewed to identify patients with “true” <b>parachute</b> mitral <b>valve</b> or parachute-like asymmetric mitral valve from January 1987 to January 2006. Predictors of palliation strategy in the entire cohort, mitral stenosis on initial echocardiogram, and mortality in the biventricular cohort were determined with logistic regression. ResultsEighty-six patients with “true” <b>parachute</b> mitral <b>valve</b> (n = 49) or parachute-like asymmetric mitral valve (n = 37) were identified. Chordal attachments to the posteromedial papillary muscle were more common (73 %). The presence “true” <b>parachute</b> mitral <b>valve</b> (P =. 008), hypoplastic left ventricle (P <. 001), and two or more left-sided obstructive lesions (P =. 002) predicted univentricular palliation. Among 49 patients maintaining biventricular circulation at follow-up, 8 died median follow-up 6. 4 years (7 days– 17. 8 years). Multivariate analysis revealed that “true” <b>parachute</b> mitral <b>valve</b> was associated with mitral stenosis on initial echocardiogram (P =. 03), and “true” <b>parachute</b> mitral <b>valve</b> (P =. 04) and conotruncal anomalies (P =. 0003) were associated with mortality. Progressive mitral stenosis was found in 11 patients; 2 underwent mitral valve interventions, and 1 died.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: To {{understand}} {{papillary muscle}} malformations, {{such as in}} <b>parachute</b> mitral <b>valves</b> or parachute-like asymmetric mitral valves, we studied the development of papillary muscles. Methods: Normal human hearts at between 5 and 19 weeks of development were studied with immunohistochemistry, three-dimensional reconstructions, and gross inspection. Scanning electron microscopy was used to study human and rat hearts. Results: In embryonic hearts a prominent horseshoe-shaped myocardial ridge runs from the anterior wall through the apex to the posterior wall of the left ventricle. In the atrioventricular region this ridge is continuous with atrial myocardium and covered with cushion tissue. The anterior and posterior parts of the trabecular ridge enlarge and loosen their connections with the atrial myocardium. Their lateral sides gradually delaminate from the left ventricular wall, and the continuity between the two parts is incorporated in the apical trabecular network. In this way the anterior and posterior parts of the ridge transform into the anterolateral and the posteromedial papillary muscles, respectively. Simultaneously, the cushions remodel into valve leaflets and chordae. Only the chordal part of the cushions remains attached to the developing papillary muscles. Conclusions: Disturbed delamination of the anterior or posterior part of the trabecular ridge from the ventricular wall, combined with underdevelopment of chordae, {{seems to be the}} cause of asymmetric mitral <b>valves.</b> <b>Parachute</b> <b>valves,</b> however, develop when the connection between the posterior and anterior part of the ridge condenses to form one single papillary muscle.

40|$|Abstract Introduction A <b>parachute</b> mitral <b>valve</b> {{is defined}} as a unifocal {{attachment}} of mitral valve chordae tendineae independent of the number of papillary muscles. Data from the literature suggests that the valve can be distinguished on the basis of morphological features as either a parachute-like asymmetrical mitral valve or a true <b>parachute</b> mitral <b>valve.</b> A parachute-like asymmetrical mitral valve has two papillary muscles; one is elongated and located higher in the left ventricle. A true <b>parachute</b> mitral <b>valve</b> has a single papillary muscle that receives all chordae, as was present in our patient. Patients with <b>parachute</b> mitral <b>valves</b> during childhood have multilevel left-side heart obstructions, with poor outcomes without operative treatment. The finding of a <b>parachute</b> mitral <b>valve</b> in an adult patient is extremely rare, especially as an isolated lesion. In adults, the unifocal attachment of the chordae results in a slightly restricted valve opening and, more frequently, valvular regurgitation. Case presentation A 40 -year-old Caucasian female patient was admitted to a primary care physician due to her recent symptoms of heart palpitation and chest discomfort on effort. Transthoracic echocardiography showed chordae tendineae which were elongated and formed an unusual net shape penetrating into left ventricle cavity. The parasternal short axis view of her left ventricle showed a single papillary muscle positioned on one side in the posteromedial commissure receiving all chordae. Her mitral valve orifice was slightly eccentric and the chordae were converting into a single papillary muscle. Mitral regurgitation was present and it was graded as moderate to severe. Her left atrium was enlarged. There were no signs of mitral stenosis or a subvalvular ring. She did not have a bicuspid aortic valve or coarctation of the ascending aorta. The dimensions and systolic function of her left ventricle were normal. Our patient had a normal body habitus, without signs of heart failure. Her functional status was graded as class I according to the New York Heart Association grading. Conclusions A recently published review found that, in the last several decades, there have been only nine adult patients with <b>parachute</b> mitral <b>valve</b> disease reported, of which five had the same morphological characteristics as our patient. This case presentation should encourage doctors, especially those involved in echocardiography, to contribute their own experience, knowledge and research in <b>parachute</b> mitral <b>valve</b> disease to enrich statistical and epidemiologic databases and aid clinicians in getting acquainted with this rare disease. </p...|$|R
50|$|The term <b>parachute</b> mitral <b>valve</b> {{stems from}} the {{morphological}} appearance of the valve; that is to say, the mitral valve leaflets appear as the canopy of the parachute, the chordae as the strings and the papillary muscle as the harness. As in the normal human heart, there exists two mitral valve leaflets, each with their own set of chordae. Unique to the <b>parachute</b> mitral <b>valve</b> is that the chordae insert on one papillary muscle, rather than two distinct papillary muscles. Often, the chordae are short and thick and this combination of factors leads to restricted movement of the mitral valve leaflets and obstruction of blood flow into the left ventricle.|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives: The morphologic {{features}} of parachute-like asymmetric mitral valves are described to discriminate this anomaly from <b>parachute</b> mitral <b>valves.</b> Background: Mitral valves with unifocal attachment of chords {{have been called}} “parachute valves,” independent {{of the number of}} papillary muscles. Therefore the anomaly involving two papillary muscles has not received separate attention. Methods: The gross anatomy of 29 mitral valves with focalized attachment of chords was studied. Results: In 28 of the autopsy specimens asymmetric mitral valves with two papillary muscles were present, and one of the muscles was elongated, located higher in the left ventricle with its tip reaching to the anulus, and attached at both its base and lateral side to the left ventricular wall. The valve leaflets could be directly attached to this abnormal muscle that received few chords or, in three hearts, no chords at all, resulting in an oblique and eccentric orifice. Because of the focalized attachment of chords to one of the two papillary muscles, we call this malformation “parachute-like asymmetric mitral valve. ” We found only one “true parachute mitral valve,” that is, one having a single papillary muscle that received all chords. Conclusions: The morphologic {{features of}} asymmetric mitral valves are essentially different from those of true <b>parachute</b> <b>valves.</b> A distinction between these two anomalies will contribute to recognition by the pediatric cardiologist and surgeon(J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1997; 114 : 9 - 15...|$|R
40|$|Abstract <b>Parachute</b> mitral <b>valves</b> (PMVs) and parachute-like {{asymmetric}} mitral valves (PLAMVs) {{are associated}} with congenital anomalies of the papillary muscles. Current imaging modalities cannot provide detailed biomechanical information. This study describes computational evaluation techniques based on three-dimensional (3 D) echocardio-graphic data to determine the biomechanical and physio-logic characteristics of PMVs and PLAMVs. The closing and opening mechanics of a normal mitral valve (MV), two types of PLAMV with different degrees of asymmetry, and a true PMV were investigated. MV geometric data in a patient with a normal MV was acquired from 3 D echo-cardiography. The pathologic MVs were modeled by altering {{the configuration of the}} papillary muscles in the normal MV model. Dynamic finite element simulations of the normal MV, PLAMVs, and true PMV were performed. There was a strong correlation between the reduction of mitral orifice size and the degree of asymmetry of the papillary muscle location. The PLAMVs demonstrated decreased leaflet coaptation and tenting height. The true PMV revealed severely wrinkled leaflet deformation and narrowed interchordal spaces, leading to uneven leaflet coaptation. There were considerable decreases in leaflet coaptation and abnormal leaflet deformation corresponding to the anomalous location of the papillary muscle tips. This computational MV evaluation strategy provides a powerful tool to better understand biomechanical and pathophysio-logic MV abnormalities.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the results of surgical repair and determine predictors for the late outcome of congenital mitral valve dysplasia. METHODS: Preoperative, operative and postoperative data were obtained from an institutional database; follow-up data came from regular clinical evaluation at our institution or elsewhere. Patients were divided into isolated and complex cases according {{to the complexity of}} associated lesions. RESULTS: Between 1972 and 2008, 93 patients (43 male and 50 female patients) underwent mitral repair (median, 4. 5 years; range, 0. 16 - 19. 8 years). Predominant mitral regurgitation was present in 52 %. Associated cardiac anomalies were present in 72 %. Sixty-one patients were in the complex group. All patients underwent successful mitral repair. Surgical repair was tailored to the patient's valve anatomy. Early death was 7. 5 %. The postoperative course was uneventful in 86 % of patients. At a mean follow-up of 10. 3 years (median, 8. 4 years; completeness, 94 %), late mortality is 8 % (7 patients). Twelve patients underwent mitral reintervention (11 replacements and 1 repair). Among the 80 survivors, 82. 5 % were in New York Heart Association class I or II, and 61. 2 % had some degree of persistent mitral regurgitation or stenosis, despite stable hemodynamics. Stenosis is a statistically significant risk factor for surgical intervention at less than 1 year of age and is related to higher overall mortality and incidence of late cardiac failure and mitral dysfunction; <b>parachute</b> mitral <b>valve</b> is related to higher mortality and morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Mitral valve repair shows acceptable early mortality and reoperation rates.

The supravalvar mitral stenosis is a typical but very infrequently detected element of the complex of anatomical abnormalities located within the left heart and the proximal aorta, called the Shone’s complex (syndrome).

40|$|AbstractBackgroundCongenital anomaly {{wherein the}} mitral valve {{leaflets}} are directly {{attached to the}} papillary muscle(s) (PM) with or without short under-developed chords is rarely reported in adults. Patients with two PMs with an intervening fibrous bridge have also been included under this head in previous studies. MethodsEchocardiography enables accurate evaluation of the morphology and function of valve leaflets, chordae tendineae, and PM. This report describes a series of six patients aged 56 – 84 years who had abnormal mitral valve with a large solitary and anomalously inserted PM seen {{over a period of}} 3 years. Only those patients who had a single pillar or bridge-like PM and either absent tendinous chords or small under-developed chords were included in the analysis. ResultsAmong 9600 consecutive echocardiograms performed, six patients met the criteria of an abnormal mitral valve with solitary large PM. Two patients underwent mitral valve replacement with partial excision of the PM wherein echocardiographic observations were confirmed. The patients were previously followed with the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (3) and rheumatic mitral valve disease (3). Multi-planar reconstruction of 3 D echocardiographic images provided incremental value in assessing the detailed patho-anatomy of PMs in these cases.

We evaluate the spectrum of mitral valve disease in patients with bicuspid aortic valves to determine the need for closer echocardiographic scrutiny/follow-up of the mitral valve. A retrospective analysis of echocardiograms done at a referral hospital over five years was conducted in patients with bicuspid aortic valves with special attention to congenital abnormalities of the mitral valve. One hundred and forty patients with a bicuspid aortic valve were included. A congenital mitral valve abnormality was present in eight (5. 7 %, P = 0. 01) with a <b>parachute</b> mitral <b>valve</b> in four (2. 8 %), an accessory mitral valve leaflet in one (0. 7 %), mitral valve prolapse in one, a cleft in one and the novel finding of a trileaflet mitral valve in one.

Among 106  antenatal suspected COA, 11 were not confirmed after birth (sensitivity= 34. 5 %). Antenatal ascending aorta diameter (AAO) and AO/PA ratio were predictors of postnatal COA. Heart failure (HF) {{was the main}} symptom in DPN group, absent in DAN (P< 0. 0001). Antenatal echocardiography was associated with lower diameter of isthmus (AOI), transverse arch (TrAO) and AAO. DPN had lower LV systolic fraction (LVSF) than DAN. Preoperative HF was associated with narrowest AOI, AAO, TrAO and decreased LVSF. PGE was administred in 53 % preoperatively and mechanical ventilation in 39 %. Among 275 confirmed COA (95  DAN and 180  DPN), 272 underwent Crafoord operation, at mean age 29 days (median 12 days) and mean time after admission 3. 4 days.

40|$|AbstractBetween 1980 and 1993, 20 {{patients}} {{less than}} 1 year of age underwent operations for congenital mitral valve disease. Ten patients had congenital mitral incompetence and 10 had congenital mitral stenosis. Mean age was 6. 6 ± 3. 4 months and mean weight was 5. 6 ± 1. 5 kg. Atrioventricular canal defects, univentricular heart, class III/IV hypoplastic left heart syndrome, discordant atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial connections, and acquired mitral valve disease were excluded. Indications for operation were intractable heart failure or severe pulmonary hypertension, or both. Associated lesions, present in 90 % of the patients, had been corrected by a previous operation in seven. In congenital mitral incompetence there was normal leaflet motion (n = 3), leaflet prolapse (n = 2), and restricted leaflet motion (n = 5). In congenital mitral stenosis anatomic abnormalities were <b>parachute</b> mitral <b>valve</b> (n = 4), typical mitral stenosis (n = 3), hammock mitral valve (n = 2), and supramitral ring (n = 1). Mitral valve repair was initially performed in 19 patients and valve replacement in one with hammock valve. Concurrent repair of associated lesions {{was performed in}} 12 patients. The operative mortality rate was zero. There were six early reoperations in five patients for mitral valve replacement (n = 4), a second repair (n = 1), and prosthetic valve thrombectomy (n = 1). One late death occurred 9 months after valve replacement. Late reoperations for mitral valve replacement (n = 2), aortic valve replacement (n = 1), mitral valve repair (n = 2), subaortic stenosis resection (n = 1), and second mitral valve replacement (n = 1) were performed in five patients. Actuarial freedom from reoperation is 58. 0 % ± 11. 3 % (70 % confidence limits 46. 9 % to 68. 9 %) at 7 years. After a mean follow-up of 67. 6 ± 42. 8 months, 94 % of living patients are in New York Heart Association class I. Doppler echocardiographic studies among the 13 patients with a native mitral valve show mitral incompetence of greater than moderate degree in one patient and no significant residual mitral stenosis. Overall, six patients have mitral prosthetic valves with a mean transprosthetic gradient of 6. 2 ± 3. 7 mm Hg. These results show that surgical treatment for congenital mitral valve disease {{in the first year}} of life can be performed with low mortality. Valve repair is a realistic goal in about 70 % of patients and possibly more with increased experience. Reoperation rate is still high and is related to complexity of mitral lesions and associated anomalies, but late functional results are encouraging.
