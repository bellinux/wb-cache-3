In this sense, the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> is one <b>of</b> the major indicators of a country's status in international trade. As its strength and sustainability significantly affect the economic policies of a government and global competitiveness, every country strives to a have a favorable balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> and maintains its long run sustainability. India’s balance <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> position was quite unfavorable during the time of country’s entry into liberalized trade regime.

The discussion is broadly classified into four parts viz. i) India’s balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> picture since 1991, ii) emerging role of invisibles and software services in balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> iii) unhealthy trends in FDI and iv) the vulnerability and challenges ahead. ...|$|R
