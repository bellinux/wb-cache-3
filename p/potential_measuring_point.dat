40|$|Objectives: This article {{describes}} {{interaction of the}} Earth’s mass—electrolytic conductor on the electrical envi-ronment of human organism—aqueous environment and skeleton. In this environment, bioelectrical and bioenergetical processes take place. Methods and subjects: Measurements of electric potential on tongue, teeth, nails, and in venous blood in subjects earthed and unearthed were conducted in Faraday’s cage {{with the use of}} an electrometer placed outside the cage. Measurements were performed in subjects in lying position and in movements of standing up and lying down. Results: In the unearthed human organism in the lying position, electric <b>potential</b> <b>measured</b> in examined <b>points</b> is around 0 mV. Contact of the Earth by a copper conductor with a moistened surface of the human body evokes a rapid decrease of electrostatic potential on the body and in venous blood to the value of approximately- 200 mV. This effect is immediate and general. Interruption of contact with the Earth causes a rapid return of the potential to its initial values in examined points. Changes in electric <b>potential</b> <b>measured</b> in venous blood and on mucosal membrane of the tongue reflect alterations in electric potential of the aqueous, electrical environment. Up-and-down movement of the insulated human organism causes transient changes in potential in the human electrical environment. During the same movement, values of potential in the electrical environment of an earthed human body remain constant. Conclusions: These results indicate that up-and-down movement and the elimination of potentials in the elec-trical environment of the human organism by the Earth’s mass may play a fundamental role in regulation of bioelectrical and bioenergetical processes. The Earth’s electromagnetohydrodynamic potential is responsible for this phenomenon...|$|R

The sample size k (number of samplers per <b>measuring</b> <b>point)</b> was chosen according {{to the results of}} the previous year (see Fig 1). At sampling site I six technical samplers were installed again at three <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> at distances of 5  m (<b>measuring</b> <b>point</b> 1, k = 1), 25  m (<b>measuring</b> <b>point</b> 2, k = 2) and 120  m (<b>measuring</b> <b>point</b> 3, k = 3). At site II, this time one <b>measuring</b> <b>point</b> was established at a distance of 80  m from the maize field margin (<b>measuring</b> <b>point</b> 4, k = 3). In 2008, three more sites were monitored by technical sampling: site IV was located in the north-eastern centre of the nature reserve. Two <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> were located at distances of 170  m (<b>measuring</b> <b>point</b> 5, k = 3) and 250  m (<b>measuring</b> <b>point</b> 6, k = 2) to the next (conventional) maize field.

The <b>measuring</b> <b>point</b> was placed at a distance of 20  m to the field margin (<b>measuring</b> <b>point</b> 7, k = 2). Site V was located right at the border of the nature reserve area. The distance of the <b>measuring</b> <b>point</b> (<b>measuring</b> <b>point</b> 8, k = 2) to the next Bt-maize field was 500  m in a westerly direction and 10  m to the next conventional maize field in an easterly direction.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- By {{setting a}} {{refractor}} {{with a certain}} angle against the optical axis of the CCD camera lens, {{the image of a}} <b>measuring</b> <b>point</b> recorded on the image plane is displaced by the corresponding amounts related to the distance between the camera and the <b>measuring</b> <b>point.</b> When the refractor that keeps the angle against the optical axis is rotated physically at high speed during the exposure of the camera, the image of a <b>measuring</b> <b>point</b> draws an annular streak. Since the size of the annular streak is inversely proportional to the distance between the camera and the <b>measuring</b> <b>point,</b> the 3 D position of the <b>measuring</b> <b>point</b> can be obtained by processing the streak. In order to show the peculiarity of our system, two kinds of applications are introduced in this paper.

40|$|Thermal error {{compensation}} is considered {{as an effective}} and economic method to improve the machining accuracy for a machine tool. The performance of thermal error prediction mainly depends on the accuracy and robustness of predictive model and the input temperature variables. Selection of temperature-sensitive <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> is the premise of thermal {{error compensation}}. In the thermal error compensation scheme for heavy-duty computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools, the identification of temperature-sensitive points still lacks an effective method due to its complex structure and heat generation mechanisms. In this paper, an optimal selection method of temperature-sensitive <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> has been proposed. The optimal <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> are acquired through three steps. First, the degree of temperature sensitivity is defined and used to select the <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> with high sensitivity to thermal error. Then, the first selected points are classified with fuzzy clustering and grey correlation grade. Finally, the temperature-sensitive <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> are selected with analysis of location of temperature sensors. In order to verify the method above, an experiment is carried out on the CR 5116 of flexible machining center. A novel temperature sensor, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor, is used to collect the surface temperature of the machine. A thermal error compensation model is developed to analyze the prediction accuracy based on four sequences of <b>measuring</b> <b>points,</b> which are generated by different selection approaches. The {{results show that the}} number of the <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> is reduced from 27 to 5 through the proposed selection method, and the thermal error compensation model based on the optimum temperature-sensitive <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> has the best performance of prediction effect...|$|R

The result is striking: Starting from a smooth distribution of <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> on a surface of a cuboid around the fuel cell, the number of <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> can systematically be reduced by more than 90 %.

The study area was simplified into two 2 D sections, a shallow and a deep section, for optimization inversion analysis in consideration of the spatial distribution of the <b>measuring</b> <b>points.</b> The main faults {{in the study area}} were simulated by 2 D surface to surface contact model, in which the friction state between hanging wall and footwall was modeled by Coulomb friction model.

The results show that a plausible ground stress field distribution of Bohai Sea and its adjacent area can be obtained with less data by the optimization inversion method.

40|$|An {{accurate}} and efficient measurement for unknown rotor profile of screw compressor {{has been a}} nodus {{in the field of}} coordinate measuring machine (CMM) measurement because of its complexity of 3 D helical surface, whose normal vectors vary with different <b>measured</b> <b>points,</b> while conventional 2 D measuring methods have the inevitable radius compensation. If <b>measured</b> <b>points</b> and corresponding normal vectors are known, a 3 D radius compensation then could be applied without a theoretical error. In this paper, a double-measurement method based on Reverse Engineering (RE) is proposed to solve this problem. The first measurement focused on constructing a 3 D CAD model as accurate as possible. So, according to the structure characteristics of the unknown rotor, a reasonable WCS is established firstly.

Communal noise generated by all noise sources {{that are found}} in the human environment, excluding the noise that occurs at the workplace in the industrial plants. It mainly comes from traffic and it's called traffic noise. Department of Public Health Vranje is authorized and accredited professional organization that performs measurements of noise pollution in the city of Vranje. Measurement of noise in both cycles included ten <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> that are found in a residential area. The level of acoustical load at each measurement point is followed by three measurements in the daily interval and two measurements in a night interval.

In V. unguiculata, the leaf water <b>potentials</b> <b>measured</b> by the in situ psychrometer oscillated at the same periodicity as, and proportional to, the leaf conductance. In all species, <b>potentials</b> <b>measured</b> by in situ psychrometers operating in the psychrometric mode were linearly correlated with <b>potentials</b> <b>measured</b> with the pressure chamber. However, the in situ psychrometers underestimated the leaf water potential in the two Helianthus species at low water potentials and overestimated the water potential in P. vera, N. oleander, and C. avellana. The underestimation in the two Helianthus species at low water potentials resulted from differences in water potential across the leaf. The overestimation in P. vera, N. oleander, and C. avellana was considered to arise from low epidermal conductances in these species even after abrasion of the cuticle. Pressure-volume studies with Lycopersicon esculentum showed that less water was expressed from distal than proximal leaflets when the whole leaf was slowly pressurized. The implication of this for water relations characteristics obtained by pressure-volume techniques is discussed. We conclude that in situ psychrometers are suitable for following dynamic changes in leaf water potential, but should be used with caution on leaves with low epidermal conductances...|$|R
