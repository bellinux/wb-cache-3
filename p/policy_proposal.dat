25|$|On July 8, 2008, Pickens {{announced}} a major energy <b>policy</b> <b>proposal,</b> called the Pickens Plan. The plan promotes a radical {{reduction in the}} United States' dependency upon foreign energy, particularly oil provided by nations in the OPEC cartel. Although {{the plan calls for}} introduction of various alternatives to oil, including wind and solar, its major component is the conversion of the nation's commercial transport sector away from OPEC diesel to natural gas. The Pickens Plan also calls for the United States to utilize its wind corridor {{in the middle of the}} country stretching from Texas northerly through the Great Plains to the Canada–US border. He noted in Congressional testimony in July 2008 that his plan would generate new jobs and provide economic stimulus to this area, while noting that it would also require new transmission lines which traditionally antagonize some environmentalists and/or nearby populations.|$|E

2500|$|Krugman {{had argued}} in The Return of Depression Economics that Japan {{was in a}} {{liquidity}} trap in the late 1990s, since the central bank could not drop interest rates any lower to escape economic stagnation.

[...] The proposal appeared first in a web posting on his academic site. This mimeo-draft was soon cited, but was also misread by some as repeating his earlier advice that Japan's best hope was in [...] "turning on the printing presses", as recommended by Milton Friedman, John Makin, and others.|$|E
