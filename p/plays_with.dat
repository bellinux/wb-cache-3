60|$|THE SHE-ANCIENT. It {{would not}} amuse us. When you <b>play</b> <b>with</b> one another you <b>play</b> <b>with</b> your bodies, {{and that makes}} you supple and strong; but if we <b>played</b> <b>with</b> you we should <b>play</b> <b>with</b> your minds, and perhaps deform them.|$|R
50|$|The {{motivation}} {{for a dog}} to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> another dog is distinct {{from that of a}} dog <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> a human. Dogs walked together <b>with</b> opportunities to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> one another, <b>play</b> <b>with</b> their owners with the same frequency as dogs being walked alone. Dogs in households with two or more dogs <b>play</b> more often <b>with</b> their owners than dogs in households with a single dog, indicating the motivation to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> other dogs does not substitute for the motivation to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> humans.|$|R

40|$|<b>Playing</b> <b>with</b> musicians, as if {{they were}} there, but without their {{physical}} presence, is an old and strong fantasy. Indeed, wouldn’t it be nice if you could <b>play</b> <b>with</b> your favorite – and inaccessible- Jazz musician? If you could <b>play</b> <b>with</b> him, or, rather, like him, but still retaining your own musical intentions? Why not then <b>play</b> <b>with</b> a virtual orchestra of musicians?

5|$|Fast is {{considered}} a skilled forward with good skating ability, hockey sense, and speed, the latter of which gives him an edge in retrieving pucks along the boards. He excels on the forecheck, is a reliable defensive forward, and plays well in the offensive, defensive, and neutral zones. Alain Vigneault has praised his work ethic and dependability, and teammate Tanner Glass has noted his ability to make responsible decisions and skillful <b>plays</b> <b>with</b> the puck along the defensive zone wall. One of Fast's drawbacks is he lacks the ideal frame for National Hockey League play, but his physical game improved after he added muscle in the 2014 offseason.|$|E

Peter's enchantment by the witch Lucinde, of whom he regards himself a slave, is possibly in reference to Johanna Kessler. Peter, like Busch, returns to his birthplace.

Busch <b>plays</b> <b>with</b> its traditional forms, motifs, pictures, literary topics and form of narration.|$|E

5|$|In {{the scene}} when Homer, Bart and Lisa pick up Maggie from the daycare center, babies are perched {{all over the}} building, staring at the family and quietly sucking on pacifiers. This is a spoof of the final shot of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds.
