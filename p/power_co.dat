The first commercial telephone service in Canada, the first telephone exchange in the British Empire, and the second telephone exchange in all of North America were each established in the city between 1877–78.

Duke <b>Power</b> <b>Co.,</b> which ruled that employers {{did not have}} to willfully discriminate against employees to violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote that certain standardized tests given by employers could be discriminatory, even if that was not the employer's intent. Another case discussed by Heins is the 1980 Supreme Court decision in Fullilove v. Klutznick, wherein the court ruled constitutional a federal law requiring a percentage of funds for a building project to be used for minority workers.|$|E
5|$|Governor Mike Easley {{declared}} a state of emergency in advance of the storm, and 200National Guard troops were dispatched to Charlotte, Raleigh, Kinston and Lumerton, while 800more were on standby. On Ocracoke Island, authorities ordered mandatory evacuations, while on Bogue Banks voluntary evacuations were in place. Officials in Wrightsville Beach drove along the streets with loudspeakers mounted on trucks, warning tourists that a storm was approaching. The storm forced the University of North Carolina at Wilmington to suspend a planned opening for students moving into residence halls. Campgrounds at the Cape Hatteras National Seashore were closed by the National Park Service and three boat ramps were closed. Duke <b>Power</b> <b>Co.</b> prepared for Charley by lowering the level of hydroelectric lakes to make room for excessive rainfall. The state Department of Environment and Natural Resources advised hog farmers to pump out their waste lagoon. About 60 Red Cross shelters were opened during the storm and during the peak of Charley, and roughly 1,600people sought protection.|$|E

25|$|One {{of the key}} added {{features}} of Black Hole Rising over its predecessor is the Super <b>CO</b> <b>Power.</b> The <b>CO</b> <b>Power,</b> introduced in Advance Wars, was a special ability unique to each commanding officer that could be triggered as the commanding officer's CO Meter filled by battle. <b>CO</b> <b>Powers</b> affected the game either by providing benefits for allied units and/or by inflicting negative effects on the enemy's units. Black Hole Rising changed {{the format of the}} CO Meter to use small and large stars, although it essentially still functions as a fillable meter. A regular <b>CO</b> <b>Power</b> is still available by filling the small stars, but a more powerful Super <b>CO</b> <b>Power,</b> introduced in Black Hole Rising, can be triggered by filling the large stars as well.|$|R
