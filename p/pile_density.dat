The rub-bing process is affected by its process parameters and also by the nature and properties of the rubbing cloth used.

As the <b>pile</b> <b>density</b> increases at same rubbing process parameters, the degree of molecular orientation of the rubbed AL and its surface roughness increase with an increase of the contact area between the rubbing cloth and the AL surface.

40|$|Background: Human food {{subsidies}} {{can provide}} predictable food sources {{in large quantities}} for wildlife species worldwide. In the boreal forest of Fennoscandia, gut piles from moose (Alces alces) harvest provide a potentially important food source {{for a range of}} opportunistically scavenging predators. Increased populations of predators can negatively affect threatened or important game species. As a response to this, restrictions on field dressing of moose are under consideration in parts of Norway. However, {{there is a lack of}} research to how this resource is utilized. In this study, we used camera-trap data from 50 gut piles during 1043 monitoring days. We estimated depletion of gut piles separately for parts with high and low energy content, and used these results to scale up gut <b>pile</b> <b>density</b> in the study area. We identified scavenger species and analyzed the influences of gut pile quality and density on scavenging behavior of mammals and corvids (family Corvidae). Results: Main scavengers were corvids and red fox (Vulpes vulpes). Parts with high energy content were rapidly consumed, mainly by corvids that were present at all gut piles shortly after the remains were left at the kill site. Corvid presence declined with days since harvest, reflecting reduction in gut pile quality over time independent of gut <b>pile</b> <b>density.</b> Mammals arrived 7 – 8 days later at the gut piles than corvids, and their presence depended only on gut <b>pile</b> <b>density</b> with a peak at intermediate densities. The decline at high gut pile densities suggest a saturation effect, which could explain accumulation of gut pile parts with low energy content. Conclusions: This study shows that remains from moose harvest can potentially be an important food resource for scavengers, as it was utilized to a high degree by many species. This study gives novel insight into how energy content and density of resources affect scavenging patterns among functional groups of scavengers.

40|$|An {{overview}} of the mechanical properties of the core of woven sandwich-fabric panels is given. These materials provide {{a new type of}} sandwich structure with a high skin-core debonding resistance and the potential for cost-effective sandwich construction. The sandwich-fabric prc forms are produced by a large-scale textile weaving process (velvet weaving). The basic mechanical properties of the sandwich core (compression and shear) were evaluated and compared with those of other core materials. There is a large variety in possible core layouts and thus mechanical performance for sandwich-fabric panels. Acceptable mechanical properties for cores of higher thickness (higher than 10 mm) can be obtained by weaving part of the pile fibres in the core under angles of +/- 45 degrees, by creating networks of piles at lower degrees of stretching and sufficient <b>pile</b> <b>density,</b> or by filling the core with foam.

In this work, single fiber pull-out test was proposed as an in vitro evaluation for the fiber shedding property of a textile pile debridement material.

Delamination resistance has previously been increased using a number of techniques, including interleafing, rubber-toughened resin systems and stitching. However, all the methods proposed to date have attendant disadvantages, severely limiting their use in practical applications. This paper presents a novel solution-a 2. 5 -dimensional (2. 5 D) fabric-which has none of the aforementioned problems. The fabric is manufactured by cutting a simple three-dimensional weave, consisting of two two-dimensional (2 D) fabrics connected by interwoven pile threads, to form a 'hairy' fabric. These 2. 5 D fabrics are impregnated with epoxy resin in the normal way, laminated and cured in an autoclave. Results are presented here for Mode I double cantilever beam and Mode II end toad split tests performed on the plain 2 D glass fabric and the 2. 5 D fabrics with glass piles. The fabrics were tested in different orientations (0 degrees, i. e., parallel to the pile fibre weave direction, 90 degrees and 45 degrees), and a variety of pile lengths and <b>pile</b> <b>densities</b> were investigated. The presence of the short piles in the matrix-rich region between laminate plies is shown to increase the fracture toughness of the 2. 5 D composite over the conventional 2 D fabric composite by virtue of the energy-absorbing effect produced by the piles in a similar manner to that produced during fibre bridging. status: publishe...|$|R

Restored bauxite mine-pits in the Jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest of south-western Australia contain introduced log <b>piles</b> at <b>densities</b> of 1 ha- 1. However, these have not facilitated colonization by Napoleon's skink (Egernia napoleonis), which rely on logs for habitat and are largely absent from restored sites.

Restored and unmined forests differed in canopy, mid- and understory cover and ground substrates, which were all potential barriers to colonization. Food availability was similar between restored and unmined forest, thus not a barrier to colonization. Skinks primarily utilized long logs, large woody debris piles, and large trees; microhabitats that were scarce or absent in restored sites and, therefore, potential barriers to colonization. Using this information, we introduced small woody debris piles into restored sites in close proximity to unmined areas containing skinks to facilitate skink colonization.

40|$|Coarse woody debris (CWD) is a {{critical}} functional and structural component of forest and woodland ecosystems, providing habitat for many species, and is an important consideration in forest and woodland restoration. CWD is very slow to develop naturally so, to accelerate the return of CWD-dependent species to restored areas, CWD is commonly returned manually. However, few studies have tested the effectiveness of such a strategy. We investigated whether the provision of CWD, heaped into 'habitat piles' of varying density (0. 4 - 5. 7 pilesha- 1), was effective in accelerating recolonisation by reptiles, frogs and mammals into 3 -year old restored bauxite mine-pits in south-western Western Australia. Both reptile and mammal communities, and the abundances of some individual species, differed significantly between unmined and restored forest but the provision of CWD had only a weak effect in accelerating recolonisation. Acritoscincus trilineatus abundance showed a weak positive relationship with habitat <b>pile</b> <b>density</b> and both Cryptoblepharus buchananii and Christinus marmoratus, species that are very rare in restoration, were recorded adjacent to habitat piles in two and one mine-pits respectively. The weak effects of CWD in accelerating recolonisation were likely due to the differences in vegetation between unmined and restored forest, resulting in restored forests being primarily inhabited by generalist species that did not require CWD, and the highest habitat pile densities being ≤ 6 % of log densities in unmined forest, suggesting that CWD-dependent species perceived all mine-pits as having similarly low levels of CWD, compared to unmined forest. Our {{results suggest that the}} provision of CWD in restored areas is critical to accelerate recolonisation of CWD-dependent fauna, but this will require consideration of both CWD spatial connectivity and temporal continuity. Spatial connectivity would be best achieved through CWD densities that approximate those in reference ecosystems, whereas temporal continuity will be harder to achieve, particularly in systems where CWD is slow to develop, and will require the development of innovative techniques and long-term management. However, ensuring the spatial connectivity and temporal continuity of CWD in restored areas should greatly increase their biodiversity value...|$|E

The jet travels {{at up to}} 50 km/s for ∼ 20 – 25 cm before colliding with a cloud of initially neutral gas. We study {{the interaction of the}} jet and the cloud in analogy to an astrophysical jet impacting a molecular cloud. Diagnostics include magnetic probe arrays, a 12 -channel spectroscopic system and a fast camera with optical filters. When a hydrogen plasma jet collides with an argon target cloud, magnetic measurements show the magnetic flux compressing as the plasma jet deforms. As the plasma jet front slows and the plasma <b>piles</b> up, the <b>density</b> of the frozen-in magnetic flux increases...|$|R
40|$|Pyrocarbon {{is used as}} a coating {{material}} for the nuclear fuel particles in High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactors. Therefore a detailed knowledge of its properties and irradiation behaviour is of high technological interest. Unrestrained, plane pyrocarbon layers have been examined in order to eliminate strains and following creep processes which occur in the coatings of fuel particles during neutron irradiation. The sample material was deposited from methane, ethine and propene at different temperatures. The irradiation with fast neutrons was carried out in the HFR Petten at the technological interesting temperature of about 1150 °C. Intermediately the samples were examined out of <b>pile</b> regarding <b>density,</b> apparent crystallite size, preferred orientation and fractional dimensional changes. Essential results of these investigations are the following: Before exposure to irradiation a correlation exists between the apparent crystallite size and the sink-float density which is independent of the type of deposition gas. During irradiation the type of deposition gas evidently has influence on the change of sink-float density, but not on the change of apparent crystallite size. The anisotropic behaviour of the dimensional changes of the pyrocarbon layers is not only attributed to the anisotropy of orientation. A correlation of the anisotropy of dimensional change with the Bacon Anisotropy Factor and the sink-float density shows, that there is also a slope from the pre-irradiation density, in particular corresponding to layers deposited at high temperatures. From it follows that in pyrocarbon layers not only an anisotropy of crystallite orientation exists but also an anisotropic arrangement of the pores and/or of the ordered and unordered domains of the material must be assumed...|$|R
40|$|A test {{apparatus}} {{to measure the}} load transfer along the shaft of a model pile inserted in a specimen of silt is described. This apparatus allows independent control of the boundary stresses of a cylindrical silt specimen in the vertical and horizontal directions. The load transfer along the shafts of smooth and rough surfaces aluminium model piles in dry silt under static load was measured. The pile installation technique used was designed to minimize soil disturbance so that the failure criterion for pile shaft friction could be investigated. The study shows {{the importance of the}} boundary conditions of the soil specimen surrounding the model pile. The study also shows the effectiveness of using rough pile in increasing the pile capacity. The magnitude of pile-displacement at failure which necessary to mobilize the ultimate shaft resistance varies significantly with the surface roughness of the pile. The results show that the angle of the pile-silt contact depends on the roughness of the <b>pile</b> surface, initial <b>density,</b> void ratio and horizontal confining pressur...|$|R
40|$|Many small {{bodies in}} the solar system are {{believed}} to be rubble piles, a collection of smaller elements separated by voids. We propose a model for the structure of a self-gravitating rubble pile. Static friction prevents its elements from sliding relative to each other. Stresses are concentrated around points of contact between individual elements. The effective dimensionless rigidity, ˜µrubble, is related to that of a monolithic body of similar composition and size, ˜µ by ˜µrubble ∼ ˜µ 1 / 2 ǫ − 1 / 2 Y where ǫY ∼ 10 − 2 is the yield strain. This represents a reduction in effective rigidity below the maximum radius, Rmax ∼ [µǫY /(Gρ 2) ] 1 / 2 ∼ 103 km, at which a rubble <b>pile</b> can exist. <b>Densities</b> derived for binary near-Earth asteroids imply that they are rubble piles. As a consequence, their tidal evolution proceeds 103 to 104 times faster than it would if they were monoliths. This accounts for both the sizes of their semimajor axes and their small orbital eccentricities. We show that our model for the rigidity of rubble piles is compatible with laboratory experiment in sand. Subject headings: asteroids 1...|$|R
