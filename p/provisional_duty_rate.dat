50|$|Inverted tariff {{benefits}} exist {{when the}} <b>duty</b> <b>rate</b> {{for the overall}} finished good {{is lower than the}} <b>duty</b> <b>rate</b> of the component parts. Therefore, by manufacturing finished goods within an FTZ, US importers {{can take advantage of the}} inverted tariff <b>duty</b> <b>rate,</b> all while keeping manufacturing operations within the US. Inverted tariff works when an importer with manufacturing authority within an FTZ is allowed to admit their components into the zone duty-free, manufacture the finished good, and pay CBP duties on the foreign content in the finished good at the lower <b>duty</b> <b>rate</b> of the finished goods at the time of entry. The importer avoids paying the higher <b>duty</b> <b>rate</b> on the component parts and defers the lower duty payment on the value of the foreign content until the time of consumption in the commerce of the US. Inverted tariff is seen predominantly in the manufacturing industry, benefiting automotive, petroleum, pharmaceutical, aerospace, electronics, textile companies and many more.|$|R
40|$|Different motives in {{determining}} the level and structure of alcohol taxes lead to greatly varying alcohol excise duty levels. The aim {{of this paper is}} to look at alcohol excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> in European Union (EU) and the mechanisms affecting them. Also the trends in alcohol prices and alcohol consumption will be discussed. Material. Material concerning alcohol taxes and consumption comes from available statistics and published literature. Results. This paper shows that despite many attempts the EU has not been able to harmonise alcohol excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> in its member states. The importance of alcohol taxes as an alcohol control measure has decreased as the real value of alcohol excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> has decreased in most EU countries during the last decades. Discussion. In most European countries the share of alcohol taxes of the price of alcoholic beverages is quite low. Therefore, increasing alcohol excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> would in most countries lead to increased alcohol tax revenues to the public sector. Consequently, increasing alcohol excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> would serve both the fiscal and the health and social policy interests of the state...|$|R

40|$|A central {{feature of}} the {{constitutional}} changes imposed {{at the time of}} Federation in 1901 was the “fiscal union ” of the six States. This union involved the abolition of tariffs on trade between the States, the harmonisation of the tariff rates and of the excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> of the former six Colonies, and the establishment of the financial arrangements to distribute the surplus net customs and excise revenues among the States. This paper examines these four elements of the fiscal union. It provides, for the first time, a measure of the change in the level of tariff duties imposed on imports from outside the Commonwealth and in excise duties. The harmonisation of the customs <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> increased the average <b>rate</b> of customs <b>duty</b> on dutiable imports from outside the Commonwealth by about 36 per cent while the harmonisation of the excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> maintained the rates at about the mid-point of these rates in the colonies. The four aspects of fiscal union are intimately connected and together they laid the foundations of assistance policy, commodity taxation and Commonwealth-Stat...|$|R
40|$|The {{constitutional}} changes {{imposed on}} the States {{at the time of}} Federation in Australia required the harmonisation of the excise tax rates of the former colonies as well as the harmonisation of <b>rates</b> of tariff <b>duty.</b> Each Colony had its own excise rate system. Excise rates were a major source of revenue for the Colonies and for the Commonwealth but the harmonisation of the excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> has not been studied. This paper outlines the excise tax systems of the Colonies before Federation and that of the Commonwealth after Federation. Estimates are made of the consumer tax equivalent rates and of the rates of protection which were implicit in the excise cum tariff systems in each Colony before Federation and in the Commonwealth after Federation. I find that the Commonwealth government harmonised the excise tax rates of the colonies at about the mid-points of the rates of the Colonies. The implicit rates of protection, however, increased after Federation because the higher customs <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> were combined with the constant excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates.</b> The paper also traces how the Commonwealth excise tax system evolved from the colonial systems of excise taxation...|$|R

30|$|In the industry, {{decisions}} on apparel design and product development {{are made with}} close interactions with global sourcers. First, fiber contents (or raw material contents) not only affect {{the cost of the}} total production but also environmental impacts during the production. Let’s assume that a designer decided a fiber content to be a natural fiber, such as cotton, rather than a synthetic fiber, such as polyester, for a men’s knit shirt for the upcoming season. This simple decision could make a huge impact on retail prices. For example, in 2011, cotton prices had quadrupled since 2002 (National Cotton Council of America 2012); the cost difference between polyester and cotton fabric was so significant that the change in fiber content was not something that the design team could simply make without consulting global sourcers. Sourcers {{may not be able to}} produce products for which the company planned. Instead, the sourcer may suggest a cotton/polyester blend fabric for knit shirts. In addition, the change in fiber content also affects the <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> when the global sourcer imports the finished products from foreign countries. In the case of the United States, men’s knit shirts with a majority of cotton fibers are subject to 19.7  % of the import cost as duty. If the same shirts are made out of synthetic fibers, they will be subject to 32  % of <b>duty</b> <b>rate</b> (Idem). These are important factors that the design team must consider and work with the sourcing team to find the optimal point between fiber choice and cost to produce and import. Different countries have different duty assessment policies and <b>duty</b> <b>rates.</b> One strategy in fiber content may work for one country but may not work for another country with different <b>duty</b> <b>rates.</b> Therefore, sourcers and design team must assess the market of the finished goods comprehensively before making final {{decisions on}} fiber choices.|$|R

40|$|This paper scrutinizes the {{determinants}} of Import Revenue generated in Ghana. An econometric model in Ordinary Least Square is employed on time series data for the period 1997 to 2014.

The paper also examines the reforms in import revenue administration, reforms in import revenue generation, effect of automation on import revenue mobilization, the performance of import revenue, sources of import revenue leakages and measures to improve the collection of import revenue. Import revenue is collected by the Customs Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority. The results reveal a strong relationship between GDP, Import Exemption, Import Value and Import Revenue.

5000|$|The {{changes in}} Stamp <b>Duty</b> <b>rates</b> in 1974, 1984, and 1986 {{provided}} researchers with [...] "natural experiments", {{allowing them to}} measure the impact of transaction taxes on market volume, volatility, returns, and valuations of UK companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. Jackson and O'Donnel (1985), using UK quarterly data, found that the 1% cut in the Stamp Duty in April 1984 from 2% to 1% lead to a [...] "dramatic 70% increase in equity turnover". Analyzing all three Stamp <b>Duty</b> <b>rate</b> changes, Saporta and Kan (1997) found that the announcements of tax rate increases (decreases) were followed by negative (positive) returns, but even though these results were statistically significant, they {{were likely to be}} influenced by other factors, because the announcements were made on Budget Days. Bond et al. (2005) confirmed the findings of previous studies, noting also that the impact of the announced tax rate cuts was more beneficial (increasing market value more significantly) in case of larger firms, which had higher turnover, and were therefore more affected by the transaction tax than stocks of smaller companies, less frequently traded.|$|R

40|$|The authors {{review the}} options for reform of stamp duties on {{immovable}} property transfers collected by Indian state governments. After briefly reviewing {{some of the many}} administrative difficulties experienced with the tax, they turn to an examination of its economic impacts. A review of stamp duties internationally indicates that Indian rates are exceptionally high, at rates often above 10 percent. Most countries' rates are less than 5 percent, including a number of low and middle-income developing countries. With these high rates, the authors find that while the tax has become the third largest revenue source for many Indian states, it imposes high compliance costs on taxpayers, has been subject to a good deal of evasion and fraud, and the distortionary impacts appear to be large, reducing the responsiveness of real estate markets in Indian cities by discouraging transactions essential to the efficient growth of cities. The authors then study the revenue implications of lowering stamp <b>duty</b> <b>rates,</b> which need to be understood if reform is to be viable. Evidence indicates that the current high <b>duty</b> <b>rates,</b> coupled with weak tax administration, lead to widespread evasion of the tax through under-declaration. This under-declaration of property values directly affects collection of other taxes, among them, property taxes and capital gains tax. Moreover, it indirectly affects the collection of all taxes through the impact of under-declaration on the circulation of black money. Simulations indicate that revenues lost due to a lowering of stamp <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> closer to international levels are quite likely to be recovered in higher collections of other taxes. However, these taxes would at least in part be collected by other levels of government. So reform could be made a more viable option through appropriately designed intergovernmental transfers...|$|R

40|$|The main {{economic}} variables have oscillated widely {{during the}} 1992 – 2005 period in Paraguay, {{in association with}} some macroeconomic and structural transformations, but also following general growth trends and business cycles in the South American region. This can be separated into three sub-periods; 1992 to 1998, 1999 to 2002 and 2003 to 2005. During the early eighties, the Paraguayan economy benefited from high public investment rates resulting from {{the construction of the}} Itaipu and Yacyreta hydro-electric power plants. The country made its own way of stability and growth during a period of hyperinflations and external debt crisis in many South American countries. Nevertheless, its economy fell into a growth crisis (still avoiding debt crisis and hyperinflation) {{during the second half of}} the eighties, once the construction period of the hydroelectric power plants came to an end. During the first half of the nineties, Paraguayan economy recovered from recession, now driven by agricultural production and a re-export business boom, based on special arrangements for <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> for electric and electronic equipment imported to the MERCOSUR (Mercado Comun del Sur - regional free trade agreement established in 1991 by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) region via Paraguay. The agricultural success was based on a recovery of international cotton prices, combined with a successful cotton extension program for small farmers within the country and a quick and widespread expansion of mechanized soybean farming. The commercial success with electric and electronic components was based on re-export. Paraguayan import <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> from outside MERCOSUR were so low, that Brazilian and Argentine enterprises would prefer to buy these products re-exported from Paraguay, rather than importing themselves from outside MERCOSUR, which would have meant higher <b>duty</b> <b>rates.</b> Before this background, Paraguayan GDP per capita grew until 1995 and then remained relatively stable until 1998.
