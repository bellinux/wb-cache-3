50|$|L-Photo-Leucine resembles L-Leucine in its structure.

This <b>photo-reactive</b> amino acid is synthesized by α-bromination of the azi-carboxylic acid followed by aminolysis of azi-bromo-carboxylic acid.|$|E
50|$|Optical fields {{transmitted}} through nonlinear Kerr media can also display pattern formation {{owing to the}} nonlinear medium amplifying spatial and temporal noise.

As a result, only DNA from live cells will be detected by PCR. This approach expands a lot the analytical scope of PCR procedures. The capability to detect only living cells become very important, because in key applications is more important to know the amount of live cells, than the total cell level. Examples of this are: food and water quality control, infectious diseases diagnostic, veterinary applications, ecological dynamics...|$|E
50|$|Filament {{formation}} and propagation {{may also be}} observed in photopolymer systems. Such systems display a Kerr-like optical nonlinearity via photoreactive-based increases in the refractive index. The filaments form {{as a result of}} the self-trapping of individual beams, or modulation instability of a wide-area light profile. Filament propagation has been observed in several photo-polymerizable systems, including organo-siloxane, acrylics, epoxy and copolymers with epoxies, and polymer blends. The locations of filament {{formation and}} propagation may be controlled by modulating the spatial profile of the input light field. Such <b>photo-reactive</b> systems are able to produce filaments from spatially and temporally incoherent light, because the slow reaction responds to the time-average intensity of the optical field, whereby femto-second fluctuations wash out. This is similar to photo-refractive media with non-instantaneous responses, which enable filament propagation with incoherent or partially incoherent light.|$|E
50|$|This {{technology}} {{takes advantage}} of temperature driven polymer bending by exposing the desired bending seams to focused strips of intense light. These bending seams are printed {{in a state of}} stress but do not deform until exposed to light. The active agent that induces bending in the material is heat transmitted by intense light. The material itself is made of chemical <b>photo-reactive</b> polymers. These compounds use a polymer mixture combined with a photoinitiator to create an amorphous, covalently cross-linked polymer. This material is formed into sheets and loaded in tension perpendicular to the desired bending crease. The material is then exposed to a specific wavelength of light, as the photoinitiator is consumed it polymerizes the remaining mixture, inducing photoinitiated stress relaxation. The portion of material exposed to the light can be controlled with stencils to create specific bending patterns. It is also possible to run multiple iterations of this process using the same material sample with different loading conditions or stencil masks for each iteration. The final form will depend on the order and resulting form of each iteration.|$|E

40|$|Wilms tumor protein (WT 1) is a {{transcription}} factor selectively overexpressed in leukemias and cancers; clinical trials are underway that use altered WT 1 peptide sequences as vaccines. Here we report {{a strategy to}} study peptide-MHC interactions by incorporating non-natural and <b>photo-reactive</b> amino acids into the sequence of WT 1 peptides. Thirteen WT 1 peptides sequences were synthesized with chemically modified amino acids (via fluorination and <b>photo-reactive</b> group additions) at MHC and T cell receptor binding positions. Certain new non-natural peptide analogs could stabilize MHC class I molecules better than the native sequences and were also able to elicit specific T-cell responses and sometimes cytotoxicity to leukemia cells. Two <b>photo-reactive</b> peptides, also modified with a biotin handle for pull-down studies, formed covalent interactions with MHC molecules on live cells and provided kinetic data showing the rapid clearance of the peptide-MHC complex. Despite "infinite affinity" provided by the covalent peptide bonding to the MHC, immunogenicity was not enhanced by these peptides because the peptide presentation on the surface was dominated by catabolism of the complex and {{only a small percentage}} of peptide molecules covalently bound to the MHC molecules.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to test whether {{cross-linking}} ATP analogues {{could be used to}} provide direct evidence of the amino acid residues which contribute to the ATP binding domain of P 2 X receptors. The UV irradiation of 2 -azido ATP caused the compound to cross-link to the P 2 X 1 receptor and caused a significant reduction in the response to ATP. The reduction of cross-linking following the pre-treatment of cells in excess ATP suggested competition between ATP and 2 -azido ATP for occupancy of the P 2 X receptor binding site. This was proven with the radio-labelling of the P 2 X 1 receptor with 2 -azido [y 32 p] ATP. Similar techniques were used to identify other <b>photo-reactive</b> compounds with activity at the P 2 X 1 receptor. These <b>photo-reactive</b> compounds had reactive sites at different coordinates around the ATP molecule and can potentially cross-link to different regions within the ATP binding domain. In an attempt to localize the ATP binding site, the P 2 X 1 receptor was tagged with flag and his epitopes and purified. Protein mass fingerprinting showed that the digestion of the P 2 X 1 protein did not provide enough coverage of the protein to guarantee successful analysis by mass spectrometry. Additionally, initial studies using digestion to identify peptide fragments which had bound to 2 -azido [y 32 P] ATP showed that experimental conditions caused the cleavage of the label from the peptide. This thesis has demonstrated that <b>photo-reactive</b> ATP analogues can be used to label the P 2 X receptors. Further work should identify a suitable combination of enzymes to efficiently fragment the protein and allow spectral analysis to identify the amino acid residues which covalently bind to each <b>photo-reactive</b> compound. This would give the first direct evidence of the contributing amino acid residues in the ATP binding domain of the P 2 X receptors. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
