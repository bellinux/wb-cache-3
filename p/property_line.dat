The street's location was chosen by two landowners who wished to attract tenants and development to their land.

That sale of $575,000, combined with the earlier $104,500 sale to the Obamas, amounted to a net profit of $54,500 over her original purchase, less $14,000 for a fence along the <b>property</b> <b>line</b> and other expenses.

One of these owners created a barricade of farm equipment along his <b>property</b> <b>line</b> that ran directly through where the stadium's infield would be.

25|$|Title to {{the land}} under the future HUD {{building}} was held by the D.C. Redevelopment Land Agency, and site preparation began in November 1965. Groundbreaking and construction had already begun {{by the spring of}} 1966. John McShain, Inc., one of the largest federal building contractors in the Washington metro area, was named the lead construction contractor. A strike by the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America temporarily delayed construction in May 1966. The building's cornerstone was laid by Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey in November of that year. Unfortunately, during the HUD building's construction, the footings for the western portion of the building were accidentally built 1.5 to 3.5 feet (0.46 to 1 metre) over the <b>property</b> <b>line.</b> The three-feet-thick (1 metre) footings were 23 feet (7 metres) underground. When L'Enfant Properties, leaseholder of the property abutting the HUD site, began construction of L'Enfant Plaza Hotel in 1971, the company was forced to sue John McShain, Inc. and the Redevelopment Land Agency for removal of the footings, stabilization of the HUD structure, and associated costs. The action spawned several lengthy court battles which lasted through the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Utility {{companies}} are typically legally responsible {{for maintaining the}} electrical infrastructure that brings power to our cities, neighborhoods, and individual buildings. Utility companies typically own this infrastructure up to the <b>property</b> <b>line</b> of an individual parcel, {{and in some cases}} own electrical infrastructure on private land as well. Utilities have expressed concern that the use of Net Metering for ZNE projects threatens the Utilities base revenue, which in turn impacts their ability to maintain and service the portion of the electrical grid that they are responsible for. Utilities have expressed concern that states that maintain Net Metering laws may saddle non-ZNE homes with higher utility costs, as those homeowners would be responsible for paying for grid maintenance while ZNE home owners would theoretically pay nothing if they do achieve ZNE status. This creates potential equity issues, as currently, the burden would appear to fall on lower-income households. A possible solution to this issue is to create a minimum base charge for all homes connected to the utility grid, which would force ZNE home owners to pay for grid services independently of their electrical use.|$|E

[...] The floor areas decrease progressively at the 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 18th floors; the staggered shape both contributes to the robot's appearance and is an efficient solution to setback regulations requiring an 18 degree incline from {{each side of the}} <b>property</b> <b>line.</b> [...] The building's ground floor is a double-height banking hall. [...] The hall's interior architecture, designed in association with the firm 7 Associates, was designed to further the robotic appearance of the building; four sculptures by Thai artist Thaveechai Nitiprabha stand at the main door. [...] Mezzanine floors located {{on each side of the}} banking hall contain offices and meeting rooms.

500|$|She is set {{firmly in}} the imperialist {{literature}} of the late-Victorian period. The so-called [...] "New Imperialism" [...] marking {{the last quarter of}} the 19th century witnessed a further expansion of British power, particularly on the African continent, and was characterised by a seemingly confident sentiment in the merits of empire and English civilisation. Thus She [...] "invokes a particularly British view of the world" [...] as Rider Haggard projects concepts of the English self against the foreign otherness of Africa. One such example occurs when Holly is first ushered into the presence of Ayesha, walking into the chamber behind a grovelling Billali who warns Holly to follow his example, or [...] "a surety she will blast thee where thou standest". Indeed, She is preoccupied with stressing quintessential British qualities through the [...] "adventure" [...] of empire, usually in contrast to foreign barbarism. However, the notion of imperialism is further compounded by the figure of She, who is herself a foreign colonising force. [...] "In a sense then", writes Stauffer, [...] "a single <b>property</b> <b>line</b> divides the realm of Queen Victoria and that of She-who-must-be-obeyed, two white queens who rule dark-skinned natives of the African continent".|$|E

2500|$|After {{the show}} got picked up to reduce {{production}} costs the interior, backyard, and pool house was rebuilt at Raleigh Studios in Manhattan Beach, Ca. [...] During some early episodes in season 1, the Cohens were doing some extensive remodeling; {{this was probably}} written in because the new set did not accurately recreate the original home in Malibu. [...] The kitchen countertop changed from a dark grey granite to a light beige marble countertop.

[...] Past the <b>property</b> <b>line</b> there were houses, streets, cars, and land between the house and the ocean.

2500|$|Under this theory, adverse {{possession}} grants only those {{rights in the}} disseized property that are 'taken' by the disseisor. For example, a disseisor might choose to take an easement rather than the entire fee title to the property. In this manner, {{it is possible to}} disseize an easement, under the legal doctrine of prescription. This must also be done openly but need not be exclusive. Prescription is governed by different statutory and common law time limits to {{adverse possession}}. It is common practice in cities such as New York, where builders often leave sidewalk space or plazas in front of their buildings to meet zoning requirements, to close public areas they own periodically to prevent the creation of a permanent easement that would cloud their exclusive property rights. [...] For the same reason, city sidewalks may have embedded markers along the <b>property</b> <b>line</b> around a plaza or open area announcing [...] "This Space Not Dedicated" [...] to indicate that although the public may use the space within the markers, it is still private property.|$|E
