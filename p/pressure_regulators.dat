25|$|In late 2012, {{the eternal}} flame began {{malfunction}}ing. The {{causes of the}} malfunction were not known, but the automatic ignition system began clicking audibly. On January 31, 2013, Meltech Corporation of Landover, Maryland, was awarded a $350,000 contract to upgrade the eternal flame. The work required that the permanent flame be extinguished, and a temporary flame displayed to one side. Army Corps of Engineers officials {{said that this was}} the first time a temporary flame was used since the permanent flame was installed. A solid white fence surrounded the permanent flame during the renovations, although the headstones of Kennedy and his family were not obscured. The flame was transferred to the upgraded permanent eternal flame on May 17, 2013, and the temporary flame extinguished. The refurbishment replaced the original 1967 burner with one that did not require a separate oxygen supply, laid new gas lines, relocated gas <b>pressure</b> <b>regulators,</b> installed automated controls to provide a more energy-efficient flame, and laid new electrical cables and replaced aging electrical conduits.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> is {{a common}} device used to {{regulate}} the working pressure for plants and machines. In aerospace propulsion systems, {{it is used to}} pressurize liquid propellant rocket tanks at specified pressure for obtaining the required propellant mass flow rate. In this paper, a generalized model is developed to perform dynamic analysis of a <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> so that constant pressure at outlet can be attained. A nonlinear mathematical model of <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> is developed that consists of dynamic equation of pressure, temperature, equation of mass flow rate, and moving shaft inside regulator. The system of nonlinear and coupled differential equations is numerically simulated and computation of pressure and temperature is carried out for required conditions and given design parameters. Valve opening and mass flow rate are also found as a function of given inlet pressure and time. In the end, an analytical solution based on constant mass flow rate assumption is compared with nonlinear formulation. The results demonstrate a high degree of confidence in the nonlinear modeling framework proposed in this paper. The proposed model solves a real problem of liquid rocket propulsion system.
