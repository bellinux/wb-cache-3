5|$|Beauveria bassiana (Hyphomycetes) is a {{pathogenic}} fungus that infects a {{wide range}} of insect species, including the Colorado potato beetle. It has shown to be <b>particularly</b> <b>effective</b> as a biological pesticide for L. decemlineata when used in combination with the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis.|$|E
5|$|Trumble was <b>particularly</b> <b>effective</b> in England. After taking 52wickets on {{his first}} tour of England in 1890, his other four visits to England—in 1893, 1896, 1899 and 1902—saw him take over 100wickets in {{first-class}} matches. In 1899, he scored 1,183runs making him one of only four Australians, with George Giffen, Warwick Armstrong (both three times) and Jack Gregory, to take over 100wickets and make over 1,000runs {{on a tour of}} England.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{have been}} documented using lures to hunt prey such as birds. This means {{they are among the}} first reptiles recorded to use tools. By balancing sticks and branches on their heads, American alligators are able to lure birds looking for suitable nesting material to kill and consume. This strategy, which is shared by the mugger crocodile, is <b>particularly</b> <b>effective</b> during the nesting season, in which birds are more likely to gather appropriate nesting materials.|$|E
50|$|Annual {{meetings}} {{focus on}} methods of breeding sport horses, <b>particularly</b> regarding <b>effective</b> selection.

50|$|Erythromycin: This {{is a wide}} {{spectrum}} antibiotic that has a similar range on the antibacterial spectrum to penicillin, making it the ideal first choice if patients are allergic to penicillin. It is also useful for treatment against B-lactamase-producing bacteria {{although it is not}} <b>particularly</b> as <b>effective</b> against oral and dental infections, due to such infections usually being caused by obligate anaerobes.|$|R
5|$|Among {{professional}} economists {{the revival}} of Keynesian economics has been even more divisive. Although many economists, such as George Akerlof, Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller, and Joseph Stiglitz, supported Keynesian stimulus, others did not believe higher government spending would help the United States economy recover from the Great Recession. Some economists, such as Robert Lucas, questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages. Others, like Robert Barro and Gary Becker, say that empirical evidence for beneficial effects from Keynesian stimulus does not exist. However, {{there is a growing}} academic literature that shows that fiscal expansion helps an economy grow in the near term, and that certain types of fiscal stimulus are <b>particularly</b> <b>effective.</b>|$|E
5|$|Courbet and Paris {{formed a}} Fifth Squadron at the {{beginning}} of the war. They were transferred to the Atlantic to continue their training duties without interference. Both ships were ordered restored to operational status on 21 May 1940 by Amiral Mord and their light anti-aircraft outfits were augmented at Cherbourg. Courbet was ordered to provide gunfire support to the defenders of Cherbourg against the advancing 7th Panzer Division and covered the evacuation of the town by the Allies while Paris supported the defenders of Le Havre. Lack of spotting aircraft meant that neither ship was <b>particularly</b> <b>effective</b> in that role.|$|E
5|$|Infrared {{astronomy}} {{is founded}} on the detection and analysis of infrared radiation, wavelengths longer than red light and outside the range of our vision. The infrared spectrum is useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light, such as planets, circumstellar disks or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust. The longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of young stars embedded in molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies. Observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) have been <b>particularly</b> <b>effective</b> at unveiling numerous Galactic protostars and their host star clusters.|$|E
40|$|The computationally-intensive {{nature of}} many data mining {{algorithms}} {{and the size}} of the datasets involved has motivated efforts to use parallel computing to produce timely results. A <b>particularly</b> cost <b>effective</b> computing platform for such parallelizations is a network of workstations (NOW). However, there are many problems associated with efficient parallelizations on a NOW, including data transmission over a low bandwidth network, load-balancing, fault-tolerance, interactivity, programming complexity, etc...|$|R
50|$|As the anode {{materials}} used {{are generally more}} costly than iron, using this method to protect ferrous metal structures may {{not appear to be}} <b>particularly</b> cost <b>effective.</b> However, consideration should also be given to the costs incurred by removing a ship from the water, for example, to repair a corroded hull or to replace a steel pipeline or tank because their structural integrity has been compromised by corrosion.|$|R
40|$|Neuromorphic {{systems are}} {{implementations}} in silicon of elements of neural systems. The idea of electronic implementation is not new, but modern microelectronics has provided opportunities for producing systems for both sensing and neural modelling {{that can be}} mass produced straightforwardly. We review the the history of neuromorphic systems, and discuss the range of neuromorphic systems that have ben developed. We discuss recent ideas for overcoming some of the problems, <b>particularly</b> providing <b>effective</b> adaptive synapses in large numbers...|$|R
5|$|To {{preserve}} the secrecy of the weapon, its use was initially permitted only over water, where a dud round could {{not fall into}} enemy hands. In late 1943, the Army obtained permission {{for it to be}} used over land. It proved <b>particularly</b> <b>effective</b> against the V-1 flying bomb over England, and later Antwerp in 1944. The use of a version fired from howitzers against ground targets was authorized in response to the German Ardennes Offensive in December 1944, with deadly effect. By the end of 1944, VT fuzes were coming off the production lines at the rate of 40,000 per day.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} approach was {{the development of}} the ADS or armoured suit, which isolates the diver from the pressure at depth, at the cost of mechanical complexity and limited dexterity. The technology first became practicable in the middle 20th century. Isolation of the diver from the environment was taken further by the development of remotely operated underwater vehicles in the late 20th century, where the operator controls the ROV from the surface, and autonomous underwater vehicles, which dispense with an operator altogether. All of these modes are still in use and each has a range of applications where it has advantages over the others, though diving bells have largely been relegated to a means of transport for surface supplied divers. In some cases combinations are <b>particularly</b> <b>effective,</b> such as the simultaneous use of surface orientated or saturation surface supplied diving equipment and work or observation class remotely operated vehicles.|$|E
5|$|By 1798 the British Royal Navy had {{successfully}} contained the French Navy {{within its own}} harbours, employing a strategy of close blockade to ensure dominance at sea during the French Revolutionary Wars. The strategy was <b>particularly</b> <b>effective</b> in the English Channel, where the proximity of British bases and the importance in limiting {{the movements of the}} French invasion forces stationed around Boulogne focused British attention on the Normandy coast. This was essential to prevent the concentration of a large force of invasion barges that had been constructed at various harbours under the guidance of a Captain Muskein. To improve the Royal Navy's ability to observe French movements on the Normandy coast, a force under the command of Captain Sir Sidney Smith seized, garrisoned, and fortified the uninhabited Îles Saint-Marcouf in 1795.|$|E

40|$|Cyclopropane {{derivatives}} first attracted {{attention in}} connection with ring strain studies. These compounds formed the subjects {{of a large number}} of papers on ring stability, but a continued study of the effect of ring opening reagents revealed that, not only did substituent groups affect the ease with which the ring-opened, but, what was of considerablygreater interest, they exercised a marked influence on the way in which the ring opened. Phenyl groups <b>particularly</b> were <b>effective</b> in this way, and have often given unexpected results. [ [...] . ...|$|R
5|$|Glass beads for {{jewellery}} {{have traditionally}} been made in Hebron. Blue beads and glass beads with 'eyes' (owayneh) were made for use as amulets since they were considered <b>particularly</b> <b>effective</b> against the evil-eye. In the Museum of Mankind collections, there exist several glass necklaces that were made in Hebron during the Mandate period or earlier. Besides necklaces made of blue and green beads, and 'eyes' beads, there are examples of beads of small hands, also called a Hamsa, representing the hand of Fatimah, {{the daughter of the}} prophet Muhammad. Most of a woman's jewellery was given to her at marriage; in the early 1920s, in Bayt Dajan, a glass bracelet (ghwayshat) made in Hebron would be considered a necessary part of the jewellery of a bride's trousseau.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Crawford was {{included}} in an Australian team which toured North America. The team was organised by Edgar Mayne, a South Australian batsman who tried to secure backing from the Australian Board of Control {{to make it an}} official representative team, but the Board refused to do so. In all matches, Crawford scored over 1,000 runs and took over 200 wickets, and he was <b>particularly</b> <b>effective</b> as a bowler in the matches designated first-class. He later stated that this was the best tour he had been on; more press rumours suggested that he would return to England {{at the conclusion of the}} tour, but he returned to Australia with the rest of the team.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{specific}} skills, Nash was <b>particularly</b> <b>effective</b> playing the pick and roll, notably with Nowitzki {{when he was}} with the Mavericks and later with the Suns' Amar'e Stoudemire and Shawn Marion. When Nash returned to Phoenix in 2004, he helped the Suns improve from a 29–53 record in 2003–04 to 62–20 in 2004–05, reaching the Conference Finals {{for the first time in}} 11 years, earning him his first MVP award. The next season, he led the Suns into the Conference Finals, despite the injuries of all three big men (Stoudemire, Kurt Thomas and Brian Grant); further, Nash was responsible for seven of his teammates attaining career-highs in season scoring. With Nash operating at the point, between the 2005–06 and 2009–10 seasons, the Suns led the league in field goal percentage.|$|E

30|$|In {{terms of}} performance, we {{explored}} {{the performance of}} the proposed method against other techniques using images from various sources with different image sizes and densities. The experimental results show that the proposed method is faster than all other techniques except for [3] that performed slightly faster for low density images. The analyses of the results are also described in Section 5. Based on our findings, we conclude that the proposed method improves the performance of connected components labeling and is <b>particularly</b> more <b>effective</b> for the high density images.|$|R
50|$|Recently {{a number}} of {{products}} have been introduced which allow popular use of bioremediation using biostimulative methods. They may harness local bacteria using biostimulation by creating a hospitable environment for hydrocarbon-devouring microorganisms, or they may introduce foreign bacteria into the environment as a direct application to the hydrocarbon. While the jury is out as to whether either is <b>particularly</b> more <b>effective</b> than the other, prima facie consideration suggests the introduction of foreign bacteria to any environment stands a chance of mutating organisms already present and affecting the biome.|$|R
5|$|Kilner {{first came}} into the Yorkshire side as a batsman. He was {{considered}} a good, reliable batsman when he began, although his style was regarded by Yorkshire critics as unorthodox {{to the point where}} they disapproved of some of his unusual, eccentric shots. For Yorkshire, he appeared high in the order, but batted between number seven and number nine for England. If the circumstances of the game demanded it, he was able to play slowly and defensively and restrain his naturally aggressive style. He was <b>particularly</b> <b>effective</b> while playing the drive and pull shot. For most of his career, his effectiveness as a batsman was not compromised by his improvement and increasing workload as a bowler.|$|E
5|$|Temsirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, {{is under}} {{investigation}} as a potential treatment.

Ridaforolimus (deforolimus) is also being researched {{as a treatment for}} people who have previously had chemotherapy. Preliminary research has been promising, and a stage II trial for ridaforolimus was completed by 2013. There has also been research on combined ridaforolimus/progestin treatments for recurrent endometrial cancer. Bevacizumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which inhibit angiogenesis, are being researched as potential treatments for endometrial cancers with high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor. Ixabepilone is being researched as a possible chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. Treatments for rare high-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma are being researched, as there is no established standard of care yet for this disease. Chemotherapies being researched include doxorubicin and ifosfamide.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization {{assisted}} the Iraqi government through {{the supply of}} drugs, analytical equipment and expertise. Many new treatments were tried, since existing methods for heavy metal poisoning were not <b>particularly</b> <b>effective.</b> Dimercaprol was administered to several patients, but caused rapid deterioration of their condition. It was ruled out {{as a treatment for}} this sort of poisoning following the outbreak. Polythiol resins, penicillamine and dimercaprol sulfonate all helped, but are believed to have been largely insignificant in overall recovery and outcomes. Dialysis was tested on a few patients late in the treatment period, but they showed no clinical improvement. The result of all treatments was varied, with some patients' blood mercury level being dramatically reduced, but a negligible effect in others. All patients received periods of treatment interspersed with lay periods; continuous treatment was suggested in future cases. Later treatment was less effective in reducing blood toxicity.|$|E

5|$|The {{electrons}} in the 4f-subshell, which is progressively filled from cerium (element 58) to ytterbium (element 70), are not <b>particularly</b> <b>effective</b> at shielding the increasing nuclear charge from the sub-shells further out. The elements {{immediately following the}} lanthanides have atomic radii that are smaller than would be expected and that are almost identical to the atomic radii of the elements immediately above them. Hence hafnium has virtually the same atomic radius (and chemistry) as zirconium, and tantalum has an atomic radius similar to niobium, and so forth. This {{is known as the}} lanthanide contraction. The effect of the lanthanide contraction is noticeable up to platinum (element 78), after which it is masked by a relativistic effect known as the inert pair effect. The d-block contraction, which is a similar effect between the d-block and p-block, is less pronounced than the lanthanide contraction but arises from a similar cause.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{medications}} available including phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate. Low-quality evidence suggests that phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproate may be equally effective in both focal and generalized seizures. Controlled release carbamazepine appears to work as well as immediate release carbamazepine, and may have fewer side effects. In the United Kingdom, carbamazepine or lamotrigine are recommended as first-line treatment for focal seizures, with levetiracetam and valproate as second-line due to issues of cost and side effects. Valproate is recommended first-line for generalized seizures with lamotrigine being second-line. In those with absence seizures, ethosuximide or valproate are recommended; valproate is <b>particularly</b> <b>effective</b> in myoclonic seizures and tonic or atonic seizures. If seizures are well-controlled on a particular treatment, it is not usually necessary to routinely check the medication levels in the blood.|$|E
5|$|Born in Tokyo to British parents, deHavilland and {{her younger}} sister Joan moved with their mother to California in 1919. They were brought up by their mother Lilian, a former stage actress who taught them drama, music, and elocution. De Havilland made her acting debut in amateur theatre in Alice in Wonderland. Later, she {{appeared}} in a local production of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, which led to her playing Hermia in Max Reinhardt's stage production of the play and a movie contract with Warner Bros. Olivia deHavilland made her screen debut in Reinhardt's A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1935. Her career playing demure ingénues opposite popular leading men, including Errol Flynn, with whom she made nine films. They became one of Hollywood's most popular romantic on-screen pairings. She achieved her initial popularity in romantic comedy films, such as The Great Garrick (1937), and in Westerns, such as Dodge City (1939). Her natural beauty and refined acting style made her <b>particularly</b> <b>effective</b> in historical period dramas, such as Anthony Adverse (1936), and romantic dramas, such as Hold Back the Dawn (1941).
