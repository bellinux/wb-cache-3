40|$|We {{prepared}} less {{volatile and}} halide-free electrolytes for room temperature non-dendritic magnesium (Mg) electrodeposition by mixing a Mg[2 +]-amide-containing ionic liquid (IL) with equimolar glyme (Mg[2 +]+IL : glyme = 1 : 1). Raman spectroscopy suggested {{that in the}} equimolar mixture most glyme molecules are coordinated to Mg[2 +] cations and/or IL cations, which is also supported by a single crystal X-ray diffraction study. The glyme-coordinated IL electrolytes showed sizable redox currents (order of mA cm– 2), while aging deterioration of electrochemical properties was observed for the triglyme mixture due to <b>partial</b> <b>bath</b> decomposition. The tetraglyme-coordinated IL electrolyte enabled flat electrodeposition of Mg with a metallic luster and showed with very high anodic stability (ca. + 4 V vs. Mg) because of decrease in uncoordinated glymes, {{which can be used}} for high-voltage Mg ion batteries...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the benefits and}} harms of combination of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitor and methotrexate (MTX) compared with TNF-α inhibitor monotherapy in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Randomized controlled trials were identified from Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Central and Clinical Trials Registry Platform, {{as well as from the}} reference sections of retrieved articles. The risk of bias was evaluated in all included trials. Data were extracted by two reviewers independently using a specially designed extraction form. The Cochrane Collaboration’s Review Manager 5. 2 software was used for data analysis. The search retrieved 852 titles, of which 3 original trials were included, involving 187 participants. The overall risk of bias is low in all three trials. Only one study was placebo controlled, and all of them examined small samples. The analysis showed no significant advantage of the MTX combination versus monotherapy. Two trials assessed Assessment of Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) 40 and the pooled risk ratio (RR) was 1. 37 and 95 % confidence interval 0. 84 to 2. 23. The RR for ASAS 20 was 1. 16 (0. 88 to 1. 52). Likewise, there were no significant difference between two groups in <b>partial</b> remission, <b>Bath</b> Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index, Magnetic resonance imaging activity score and other secondary outcomes. Withdrawals for side effects and for any reason were similar in two groups, RR were 1. 89 (0. 71 to 5. 02) and 1. 11 (0. 67 to 1. 84), respectively. The evidence available did not support any benefit of adding MTX to TNF-α inhibitor for the treatment of AS...|$|R
