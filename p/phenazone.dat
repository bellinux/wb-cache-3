50|$|<b>Phenazone</b> (INN and BAN; {{also known}} as phenazon, antipyrine (USAN), or analgesine) is an analgesic, a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) and an antipyretic. It was first synthesized by Ludwig Knorr in 1887. <b>Phenazone</b> is synthesized by condensation of phenylhydrazine and ethyl acetoacetate under basic conditions and methylation of the resulting intermediate compound 1-phenyl-3-methylpyrazolone with dimethyl sulfate or methyl iodide. It crystallizes in needles which melt at 156 °C. Potassium permanganate oxidizes it to pyridazine tetracarboxylic acid. <b>Phenazone</b> has an elimination half life of about 12 hours.Indication: Used to relieve pain and fever. Antipyrine is often used in testing the effects of other drugs or diseases on drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver.|$|E

40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{sequence of the}} genom DNA fragment in the strain 2 - 79 containing the biosynthesis genes of the phenazines has been determined. 9 genes organized as three operons have been localized in the sequential field. The expression of all the genes in the E. coli cells has been shown. The supposition that synthesis level of the phenazine antibiotics among given bacteria is regulated depending on the titre of the cells in the culture. The role of the separate structural genes in the biosynthesis of the phenazine carboxylate has been studied. The principial scheme for the antibiotics biosynthesis way has been proposed. The biosynthesis genes of the phenazines among different pseudomonads have been identified.

50|$|In 1882 Knorr {{received}} his PhD for a thesis titled Über das Piperyl-Hydrazin.

In that time, during his search for quinine related compounds, Knorr discovered the unmethylated <b>Phenazone.</b> As another quinine-related compound kairin showed analgesic and antipyretic properties, Knorr and Fisher asked Wilhelm Filehne at the Hoechst company to check the unmethylated and the methylated <b>phenazone</b> for its pharmacological properties. Knorr patented the compound in 1883. Filehne later suggested the names Höchstin or Knorrin for the substance but Knorr telegraphed from his honeymoon that his variant of the name, antipyrine, {{is not to be}} changed. (German: Antipyrin bleibt!). In 1885 Knorr married Elisabeth Piloty, the sister of his laboratory colleague Oskar Piloty at the University of Munich.|$|E

40|$|Ozonation {{has been}} {{proved to be a}} {{promising}} approach for eliminating emerging pollutants in wastewater. In previous studies, emerging pollutants including diverse pharmaceuticals were found to exhibit significantly different ozonation reactivity. However, how the structural differences of emerging pollutants determine ozonation reactivity and mechanisms are still ambiguous. In this work, ozonation of dimethylaminophenazone (DMP) and acetylaminophenazone (AAA) with the same parent structure of <b>phenazone</b> but different substitution groups was investigated, in order to probe influencing mechanisms of structural differences on ozonation reactivity. Results show that DMP reacts with ozone and HO·≡ almost 2 and 1 order of magnitude faster than AAA, respectively. At pH 8, HO·≡ accelerates ozonation of DMP, but decreases ozonation of AAA. Competition simultaneously decreases degradation rate of the two phenazones, but effects on AAA are more significant than that on DMP. According to theoretical calculation results, differences in ozonation reactivity and mechanisms of the two phenazones can be mainly attributed to different substitution groups. The dimethylamino group in the structure of DMP increases the ozonation reactivity of <b>phenazone</b> by increasing reaction orbital energies and altering reaction sites, while the acetylamino group in the structure of AAA decreases the reaction orbital energy and therefore lowers the reactivity...|$|E
40|$|Phenazone-type pharmaceuticals, such as aminopyrine, metamizole, <b>phenazone</b> and propyphenazone, {{are widely}} used analgesics that have been {{detected}} in wastewater treatment plant effluents in μgL(- 1) concentrations.

Slow sand filtration (SSF) and riverbank filtration (RBF) are examples of natural filtration that have been used. SSF is a low-cost water treatment technology often used by small municipalities and households. It can be used {{to improve the quality of}} the source water in the aftermath of a natural disaster as well as in underdeveloped countries and rural areas. RBF, on the other hand, can be used as a primary treatment or a pre-treatment of water for municipalities and regional authorities. Similar removal processes, such as filtration, biodegradation, and adsorption, occur during both natural filtration technologies. However, during RBF the additional processes of chemical precipitation, redox reactions and mixing can occur. SSF and RBF showed similar removal efficiency in terms of turbidity (20 [...] 90 % vs. 70 [...] 90 %), total coliforms and E. coli (1 [...] 3 logs in both filtration technologies). Two SSF units, disposed in parallel or in series, coupled with two post treatment pointof-use (POU) devices (an ultraviolet water treatment, UV unit, or an activated carbon impregnated with silver nanoparticles, AC unit) were used to examine the ability to treat source water with high levels of turbidity (> 20 NTU), high bacterial content (E+ 6 to E+ 7 MPN/ 100 mL of total coliforms and E. coli), and pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs, at concentration of 50 g/L). Six PhACs, caffeine, carbamazepine, 17 - estradiol (E 2), estrone (E 1), gemfibrozil, and <b>phenazone</b> were selected using a multi-step approach based on: i) occurrence in the environment, ii) toxicity and pharmaceutical class, iii) environmental fate, iv) behavior under different redox conditions, and v) availability of analytical standards and adequate instrumentation. Turbidity removal ranging from 40 % to 80 % and removal of total coliforms and E. coli greater than 95 % was consistently achieved by SSF regardless of the configuration (series vs. parallel) of the units, the hydraulic loading rate, the starting turbidity of the source water and the presence or absence of PhACs. However, the presence of a post treatment unit, such as an UV unit, is desirable to further {{enhance the quality of}} the source water, especially in the presence of bacterial loads greater than 106 MPN/ 100 mL. SSF can also be used to treat water with a high concentration of PhACs such as a wastewater treatment plant spill or a pharmaceutical industry spill. However, the nature and concentrations of the PhACs, the duration of the spill, and the age of the SSF may significantly impact the overall performance of the filtration unit in terms of bacterial removal. Among the selected PhACs, complete removal of caffeine, and partial removal of E 2 and E 1 (11 [...] 92 %) were achieved by both SSF units. Adsorption and biodegradation are the main removal mechanisms for the selected PhACs. None to limited (< 10 %) removal of carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, and <b>phenazone</b> occurred. Columns and two side-by-side sandbox were used to investigate the role of oxygen (aerobic vs. anoxic), temperature (summer vs. winter), and level of organic matter (TOC = 3, 10, 20 mg/L) on the removal of selected PhACs during simulated RBF. The same PhACs investigated during SSF were also used for the simulated RBF. RBF can be effectively used to remove most of the PhACs present in surface waters. However, the geochemistry of the RBF site is expected to play a key role in their removal. Depending on the compound, removal of PhACs may predominantly occur due to biodegradation, but environmental variables such as oxygen and temperature may enhance or limit biodegradation. Limited and slower removal of selected PhACs may occur during the winter temperature conditions. Limited removal of carbamazepine (< 10 %) and gemfibrozil (< 30 %) occurred regardless of the different environmental conditions. Among the different PhACs, removal of <b>phenazone</b> occurred only under aerobic conditions, while removal of caffeine was highly impacted by the level of organics as well as by the temperature. The occurrence of air beneath the riverbed can enhance the development of locally present aerobic conditions, that leads to an enhanced removal of redox sensitive PhACs...|$|E
