40|$|This {{was a study}} {{about ways}} of {{improving}} the Cañete small farmer community (4, 800 households, 18, 080 ha) through agricultural extension. Several procedures were used to gather data. A sondeo (rapid appraisal survey) was conducted to obtain a general understanding of the community. A survey of 60 random household interviews was also conducted to obtain accurate information. Other secondary data sources were also used. The analyses included production functions, linear programming, and extension programming. Production functions for seven geographical zones were generated based upon multiple regression of cotton yield {{as a function of}} fertilization and environmental factors. Linear programming was used to simulate and better understand the current situation of individual households. Following statistical validation, a projection of future production, income, and consumption was undertaken at the household level. These simulation models are “interactive working models. ” Finally, a list of nine <b>priority</b> <b>extension</b> programs for the Cañete farm community was proposed...|$|E

In addition to some linear strengthening techniques, two mathematic formulations, 4 -index and 5 -index models, are proposed in the approach and coded in GAMS (Cplex solver). They are tested on a number of problems and the results show that the 5 -index model outperforms the 4 -index model.

It was administered through Qualtrics, Cornell’s survey tool, and had a total of 187 respondents. The survey consisted of several general questions {{and a list of}} potential priorities. The priorities were divided into 7 major categories (pest management, soil management, cultural practices, food safety, cover cropping, marketing, and wildlife damage) as well as an other category. The priority that ranked the highest was pest management with 30 % of respondents choosing this as their primary challenge in vegetable production. Cucurbit was the crop that gave respondents the most problems. The second biggest priority for vegetable growers was wildlife management, specifically deer in sweet corn, followed by damage to cucurbits. For rankings of all priorities see the results and Appendices below.

40|$|Development of Organic Agriculture {{stem from}} the demand for safe and {{environmentally}} friendly food, which arose from outcome mistakes made by the Green Revolution that failed to achieve sustainable food security. Organic Agriculture awareness started from the north where severe negative impacts of the Green Revolution exist. In order to counteract such negative effects to the environment, together with early {{awareness of the need}} to conserve the environment, Organic Agriculture spread to the south at a fairly fast rate. The result is that Organic Agriculture support systems, such as research, extension and education, as well as related policies are lacking. However, the south and Uganda in particular has a favorable environment for the growth of Organic Agriculture, which already existed among the many small holder farmers who dominate the Ugandan Agricultural sector. There are also institutions and individuals who view the way forward to sustainable agricultural development, lasting food security, and better health to be in adopting Organic Agriculture. As such the limited Organic Agriculture development in Uganda now requires immediate refocusing of research <b>priorities,</b> <b>extension</b> of environment friendly technologies, offering of Organic Agriculture as part of training curricula at all educational levels, and above all putting in place an Organic Agriculture Policy. This paper gives a detailed review of the status quo Organic Agriculture research in Uganda, and gives recommendations on the way forward. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} unified {{approach}} {{to the construction of}} belief sets for logic programs with the classical connective of negation, disjunctive logic programs, and what we call arbitrary logic programs that contain an arbitrary formula in the head and arbitrary formulas in the premises of a program rule. The approach is based on a nondeterministic iterative operator constrained by a dynamic preference relation, which is drawn automatically during the iterative process. This iterative construction can be viewed as an inference-based extension to the stable model semantics in that every stable model with a well-founded preference relation is computed as an iterative answer set. For function-free datalog programs, the construction itself suggests a sound and complete proof procedure, and there exists a polynomial time algorithm for computing an iterative answer set.

40|$|This paper uses a {{state-space}} {{approach and}} {{an analysis of}} overload cycle constraints {{to show that a}} simple extension of Generalized Bandwidth Balancing (GBWB), can be used to strictly enforce non-premptive <b>priorities.</b> The <b>extension</b> associates a Bandwidth Balancing Machine and counter with each queue access machine rather than with the node in order to implement priorities. The entire DQDB network is modeled as a large Finite State machine. Overload cycles are those cycles in the state space that correspond to the situation that all nodes attempting to access the bus are attempting to do so continuously. Simple analytical constraints on the node counters allow derivation of the bandwidth sharing amongst the nodes and give insight into how the system structure results in such sharing. GBWB may be viewed as a mechanism that implements "rate-based" priorities that result in predictable apportioning of the bandwidth.

40|$|Digitisation of {{library and}} archival {{collections}} {{has recently been}} facilitated by improvements in digital storage technologies and related scanners and software. However the success of such initiatives is also contingent on the financial and staff resources available to make best use of these new and evolving digitisation opportunities.

However, within an environment of budgetary constraints and diminishing staff resources, adaptions to the program have been necessary.

40|$|Abstract: Based on a concise but {{comprehensive}} overview of some fundamental properties re-quired from component-based frameworks, namely compositionality, incrementality, flattening, modularity and expressiveness, we review three modifications of the semantics of glue operators in the Behaviour-Interaction-Priority (BIP) framework. We provide theoretical results and examples illustrating the degree, {{to which the}} three semantics meet these requirements. In particular, we show that the latest semantics, based on the offer predicate {{is the only one}} that satisfies all of them. The classical and offer semantics are not comparable: there are systems that can be assembled in the classical semantics, but not in the offer one. We present a strict characterisation of the behaviour hierarchy determining the conditions, under which systems in the classical semantics can be transposed into the offer semantics directly, with minor modifications, by introducing a new type of synchronisation or not at all. The offer semantics allows us to extend the algebras, which are used to model glue operators in BIP, to encompass <b>priorities.</b> This <b>extension</b> uses the Algebra of Causal Interaction Trees, T (P), as a pivot: existing transformations automatically provide the extensions for the Algebra of Connectors. We then extend the axiomatisation of T (P), since the equivalence induced by the new operational semantics is weaker than that induced by the interaction semantics.
