5|$|A minor {{knee injury}} which only left Hunt out {{for two weeks}} was enough to deny him the {{opportunity}} to regain the fullback <b>position</b> <b>for</b> Australia in the Centenary Test against New Zealand in May 2008. Hunt's place in the Queensland team for the 2008 State of Origin series was assured by Queensland coach Mal Meninga but there was speculation that Hunt could play five-eighth in place of injured teammate Darren Lockyer. While not the best five-eighth possibility for the Queensland representative team, his selection there would make way for the Australian fullback Billy Slater. Hunt, having never played a senior rugby league game at five-eighth, was controversially selected at the <b>position</b> <b>for</b> Queensland instead of the in-form Scott Prince.|$|E
