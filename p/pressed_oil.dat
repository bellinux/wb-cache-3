5|$|There {{are several}} types of plant oils, {{distinguished}} by the method used to extract the oil from the plant. The relevant part of the plant may be placed under pressure to extract the oil, giving an expressed (or <b>pressed)</b> <b>oil.</b> The oils included in this list are of this type. Oils may also be extracted from plants by dissolving parts of plants in water or another solvent. The solution may {{be separated from the}} plant material and concentrated, giving an extracted or leached oil. The mixture may also be separated by distilling the oil away from the plant material. Oils extracted by this latter method are called essential oils. Essential oils often have different properties and uses than pressed or leached vegetable oils. Finally, macerated oils are made by infusing parts of plants in a base oil, a process called liquid-liquid extraction.|$|E

The methods are solvent extraction using n-hexane as extractive solvent; and traditional hydraulic press methods.

Percentage oil yields were 53. 25 % and 46. 89 % for the solvent extracted and hydraulic <b>press</b> <b>oils</b> respectively. The oil sarnple's odour was not offensive {{at room temperature for}} either method. Specific gravity was 0. 86 g/kg for solvent extracted oil and 0. 94 g/kg for oil obtained through hydraulic press. Saponification value ranged from 85. 5 g/kg for hydraulic <b>press</b> <b>oil</b> to 96. 62 g/kg for solvent extracted oil. pH values for both samples were below 7. 0, and the refractive index for both samples was 1. 47.

Both oil samples were in liquid state at room temperature and boiling points varied from 94 °C to 98 °C for solvent extracted <b>oil</b> and hydraulic <b>press</b> <b>oil</b> respectively.

40|$|Background. It {{seems that}} {{patients}} may ask general practitioners about natural cosmetics applied {{on the skin}} regarding their safety and suitability. Objectives. The aim {{of the study was}} to analyze natural cold <b>pressed</b> <b>oils</b> as potential cosmetic products. Material and methods. Cold <b>pressed</b> <b>oils</b> obtained from selected seeds and fruit stones were analyzed, including: chokeberry seed oil, blackcurrant seed oil, elderberry seed oil, raspberry seed oil, apricot seed oil, tomato seed oil, strawberry seed oil, broccoli seed oil, Nigella sativa seed oil, hemp oil, safflower seed oil, Silybum marianum seed oil and coconut oil. 80 adult volunteers assessed the cosmetic properties of the analyzed oils. Each of the volunteers tested 2 to 4 different oils, by applying them on the skin. In addition, patch tests with all analyzed oils were performed on 23 individuals. Results. The majority of tested oils were positively evaluated by the participants: in the opinion of the participants, oil extracted from safflower had the best appearance (100 % positive opinions), coconut oil had the best smell (70 % positive opinions), while black currant seed oil showed the best absorbency (85 % positive opinions). No irritation was observed within the analyzed product group, albeit one allergic reaction to apricot seed oil was observed with patch testing. Conclusions. Based on the achieved results, it could be suggested that natural cold <b>pressed</b> <b>oils</b> can be applied to the skin as cosmetics.

30|$|Both {{windmill}} and hydraulic pressed oils {{have been}} used in the 19 th century. However, we preferred to use the water-washed windmill <b>pressed</b> <b>oil</b> above the hydraulic <b>pressed</b> <b>oil</b> for several reasons. Firstly, by using the windmill extraction method relative large amounts of linseed oil could be pressed at once; if we had used the hydraulic press at our disposal instead, the process would have been far more time consuming. Furthermore, the water-washed windmill oil has a somewhat lower quality—a higher acid value and a more yellow colour—than the hydraulic <b>pressed</b> <b>oil,</b> which is possibly what one might expect for a linseed oil produced in the 19 th century.|$|E

For the same reason a slight increase in acidity is also observed after water washing the oil. Using different storage conditions does not influence the acidity of the oil much.|$|E
