40|$|We {{report the}} results of an {{expedition}} to a barnacle-goose (Branta leucopsis) breeding area in Kolokolkova Bay, west of the lower Pechora delta in northern Russia, undertaken in July 2002. In total, 6 breeding colonies were found within the study area, harbouring 1, 324 nests. Mean clutch size was 2. 77 +/- 0. 10 but may have been underestimated because of nest predation. Nest predation was high and correlated with the density of breeding gulls, Larus. The 2002 season was relatively cold and <b>peak</b> <b>hatch</b> occurred late, on 14 July. More than 11, 000 barnacle geese were found to moult in the area which, together with the large number of nests found, emphasises the importance of Kolokolkova Bay for barnacle geese. Adult barnacle geese (341) were captured, marked and measured during their annual wing moult. Birds with broods started to moult approximately 2 weeks later than non- and failed breeders. Weight loss during moult was 3 times as rapid as reported for barnacle geese breeding in the Baltic, and a large cost of reproduction seemed to exist in the form of reduced body weight at the onset of moult for birds leading broods. Work in the area will continue over the coming years to document and explain the differences in major life-history parameters, dynamics and environmental effects between arctic and temperate breeding barnacle-goose populations...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies showed}} that freshly {{collected}} zoea- 1 larvae of the shore crab Carcinus maenas from coastal waters possessed endogenous circatidal vertical migration rhythms. Present experiments demonstrate that zoea- 1 larvae released by crabs which extruded eggs in the field but were then kept in laboratory constant conditions since collection, also exhibited endogenous circatidal vertical migration rhythms. Such rhythms were shown by newly hatched larvae from nearly all of 50 females which released larvae in the laboratory, some of which had carried eggs in the laboratory for up to 3 – 4 months. Thus, since entrainment by tidal variables could not have occurred during embryonic development in these cases, other synchronising factors must set the phase of the larval circatidal rhythms. Present {{results suggest that the}} hatching process itself is the main synchroniser; upward swimming occurred just after hatching and at 12. 4 h intervals thereafter. This is consistent with previous observations of <b>peak</b> <b>hatching</b> in Carcinus primarily around nocturnal high tide, with larvae in the field exhibiting tidal vertical migration rhythms of ebb-phased upward swimming associated with dispersal during ebbing tides.

40|$|Population {{dynamics}} and maturity parameters were analysed for seasonal {{samples of the}} oceanic ommastrephid squid Todarodes filippovae from {{off the coast of}} Tasmania Australia from 2002 to 2004. Based on assumed daily periodicity in statolith increments, T. filippovae had a life cycle of about a year with the sexually dimorphic females reaching their larger size by predominantly growing faster than males. Due to the small sample size of males, analysis was undertaken on female individuals only. Growth in all samples was best described by a power curve and varied annually, with significantly faster growth in 2001 compared to the subsequent 2 years. Seasonal growth rates also varied with autumn- and winter-hatched squid significantly faster than summer-hatched squid. Spring growth rates were intermediate but not significantly different to the other three seasons. <b>Peak</b> <b>hatching</b> periods occurred in late autumn and early winter. ANOVA revealed a season × year interaction for mantle length and total body weight. Pairwise comparisons showed that the annual differences were likely driven by smaller squid in autumn 2002 compared to autumn samples in the other 2 years. Pairwise comparisons also revealed seasonal differences with winter-caught squid smaller than those from the majority of other samples. There were no seasonal effects on mature female gonad weights but females caught in 2002 had significantly lighter gonad weights than females from the following 2 years. There were no consistent trends among seasons or years in the age structure of mature females.

40|$|Rehabilitation of {{sturgeon}} populations {{requires an}} understanding of sturgeon autecology during all life stages, especially during early life when high mortality occurs. To begin to understand sturgeon early-life history I determined river of origin on a multi-basin scale (i. e., potential rivers of origin). I then determined habitat needs and early life demographics on a more localized scale (i. e., specific river). Trace elements differ between river reaches of the central US and {{may be used to}} determine origin of age- 0 sturgeon. My trace element analyses suggested that age- 0 sturgeon captured in the Middle Mississippi River, which extends from the confluence of the Missouri River downstream to the confluence of the Ohio River, drifted from as far upstream as the Gavins Point Dam on the Missouri River (3 ̆e 1200 km), while other individuals originated locally in the Middle Mississippi River. On a more refined scale of habitats, I used trawling to identify habitat features used. Age- 0 Scaphirhynchus sturgeon catch rates were highest around artificial structures (i. e., wing dikes) and island areas while main channel habitat comprised the lowest catch rates. Within these habitats, young sturgeon frequently occupied low velocities (i. e., 0. 1), moderate depths (i. e., 2 to 5 m), and sand substrate. Although determination of river of origin and specific habitats used are imperative for restoration, sturgeon populations are likely regulated by factors within habitats that affect early-life dynamics. Mean sturgeon growth rates ranged from 1. 42 - 1. 50 mm/d over the four years but did not differ among years. Individuals hatched over a 25 to 50 -d period and <b>peak</b> <b>hatch</b> dates were between 10 - 20 May during all years.

40|$|Offspring, {{especially}} during early development, {{are influenced by}} both intrinsic properties endowed to them by their parents, extrinsic environmental factors {{as well as the}} interplay between genes and the environment. We investigated the effects of paternity (P), temperature (T), and asynchronous hatching on larval traits of cod, Gadus morhua from the Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea. Daily cohorts of 4 half-sib families of Atlantic larvae and 5 half-sib families of Baltic larvae were incubated and hatched at 5 temperatures (Atlantic 2. 0 – 10. 0 °C, Baltic 6. 5 – 12. 5 °C) and imaged for notochord length (LN), yolk-sac area (AY), and deformities. Larvae hatching on a given day were incubated at the same temperature and sampled at 4 days post-hatch (DPH) for growth, yolk utilization rate (YUR) and efficiency (YUE). The mean ± SE duration of the hatching window decreased with increasing temperature in both Atlantic (5. 4 ± 0. 1 to 2. 6 ± 0. 3 days from 2. 0 to 10. 0 °C) and Baltic larvae (6. 2 ± 0. 4 to 5. 0 ± 0. 6 days from 6. 5 to 12. 5 °C) and LN increased and AY decreased for every subsequent day of hatch. Deformities increased with increasing T and P × T explained 52. 3 and 26. 8 % of the variance for Atlantic and Baltic larvae, respectively. In Baltic larvae, size at <b>peak</b> <b>hatch</b> tended to decrease with increasing T and P × T explained 34. 6 % of the variance. In Atlantic larvae, growth, YUR and YUE were influenced by T while P alone explained 26. 0 % of the variance in YUE and up to 66. 4 % of variance in morphological traits at 4 DPH. Asynchronous hatching significantly affected larval growth, YUR, and YUE with P explaining 37. 1 % of the variance in growth for Atlantic larvae. Temperature and asynchronous hatching interacted to produce larvae that were generally longer and had smaller AY if they were incubated at colder temperatures or if they hatched {{at the end of the}} hatching period at a specific temperature. Differences in larval morphometrics among temperatures for early hatching larvae decreased or even reversed for later hatching larvae. In light of anticipated global climate change, the present study on cod provides further insight in understanding the genotype-based variability and the adaptive potential to an ecologically changing environment...|$|E

40|$|In {{anticipation}} {{of the development of}} a new fishery for the ommastrephid squid Martialia hyadesi in the Scotia Sea, this paper presents a revision of annual consumption of the species by higher predators and provides a brief review of information about the life cycle and distribution of the species obtained from research fishing and commercial catches. This species is eaten by seals, whales and seabirds, the latter being the most reliable source of consumption data because comprehensive sampling can be carried out during their breeding seasons. A conservative estimate for total annual consumption of M. hyadesi by higher predators in the Scotia Sea is 245 000 tonnes, with an upper estimate of 550 000 tonnes if less reliable data are included. M. hyadesi spawns between autumn and mid-summer with <b>peak</b> <b>hatching</b> in winter/spring. Its life span has not been established. Data from the CCAMLR Convention Area suggest that M. hyadesi may live for two years, but this may vary. In common with other ommastrephids, the species is probably semelparous. It is proposed that the timing and catches of the fishery should be highly conservative and set taking into account the timing of breeding and consumption rates of the most sensitive of the dependent species. Most Antarctic predators which have been studied consume relatively small and immature specimens of M. hyadesi. Fishing for M. hyadesi after the chick-rearing period of the most sensitive predator (grey-headed albatross) would minimise competition locally and ensure that the fishery only exploited the stock after escapement from most higher predator species. It would also allow seabird predation of the stock to be monitored prior to the fishing season as a way of assessing numbers of pre-recruits. Closing the fishery before recruitment of the next generation of squid would ensure availability of prey to higher predators during the following chick-rearing period. Preliminary data from a squid jigger which undertook research fishing around South Georgia in June 1996 provided the basis for determining realistic potential catch rates...|$|R

40|$|Reproductive {{performance}} of Ring-billed Gulls (Larus delawarensis) {{in relation to}} nest location was investigated on Granite Island, northern Lake Superior, in 1976 and 1977. To determine whether any differences existed in the hatching and fledging success of central and peripheral areas of the colony in 1976 and 1977, only 3 -egg clutches initiated {{early in the season}} were used. This eliminated two variables that may also affect success; they are clutch size and time of clutch initiation. In both years, 25 3 -egg clutches {{in the center of the}} colony were exchanged with 25 3 -egg clutches on the periphery. Twenty-five 3 -egg clutches were marked concurrently in each area as controls. In both years, there was no significant difference in hatching success (86 %), or fledging success (58 %) between exchange and control nests. These results indicated the ability of the gulls to hatch eggs and raise young was not related to nest location. Ten clutches from each area which were artificially incubated, had essentially equivalent hatching success. To determine if there was a difference in attentiveness in the two areas, 25 nests in each area were monitored photographically for 6 days during the incubation period. In both years, over 90 % of the gulls incubated a minimum of 90 % of the time regardless of nest location. In 1977, histories were known for all nests in the study area.

[...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Wildlife, 2012 The {{influence}} of nest location, terrain, social environment (e. g., nesting density), breeding synchrony and foraging {{effort on the}} reproductive success of Common Murres (Uria aalge) nesting at Castle Rock National Wildlife Refuge in northern California (2009 ??? 2010) was examined. Robotic video cameras were used to minimize the effects of human disturbance. Individual nest sites were selected and observed though the nesting season to determine timing and success of breeding. Adult behaviors were used to index foraging conditions. Murres at Castle Rock had relatively high breeding success (69 %) both years of the study. Nest site characteristics and adult behaviors that influenced success varied between the incubation and chick-rearing periods and between years, although breeding synchrony influenced both hatching and fledging success. Hatching success was influenced by nest site terrain, social environment and laying synchrony. Nest sites {{were more likely to}} fail during the incubation period if they were located on even substrates or along the edge of a group of sites. The occurrence of site flooding had a pronounced effect on hatching success: nest sites where flooding was observed were 5. 2 times more likely to fail in 2009 than nest sites where flooding was never observed. Eggs that hatched late relative to all observed nest sites {{were also more likely to}} fail than eggs that hatched early or during the <b>peak</b> of <b>hatching.</b> Fledging success was influenced by social environment, hatching synchrony and foraging effort. Nest sites with fewer breeding neighbors were more likely to fail, as were nest sites where adult aggression was never observed. Most notably, chicks that hatched late relative to other nest sites in the immediate vicinity and relative to all observed nest sites were approximately 4 and 7 times more likely to fail, respectively, than nest sites that hatched early or during the <b>peak</b> of <b>hatching.</b> Although opportunistic predation may have accounted for nest failures at isolated or exposed nest sites, the majority of losses at Castle Rock were associated with unstable nesting environment and microclimate during the incubation period and limited food availability during the chick-rearing period.

40|$|European {{flounder}} (Platichthys flesus L.) {{economic value}} {{is estimated to}} be worth over 68 million to the Irish economy (mainly from recreational angling activities). Despite such large species value, there is a considerable lack of data for this region, particularly concerning stock structure, timing of life history events and juvenile habitat use patterns. This dissertation addresses these knowledge gaps and describes a number of studies which focus on the understanding of flounder nursery ground ecology. Understanding stock structure and the connectivity between geographically distinct groups of fish is critical for the sustainable management of a species. Meristic analysis revealed a modest separation of juvenile flounder from different regions (west coast of Ireland, east coast of Ireland and the Welsh coast). The variation between regions was subtle and there was a large degree of overlap. The technique is therefore not a powerful method of stock identification on its own but may improve the likelihood of detecting flounder stock structure if combined with other markers in a multidisciplinary approach to stock identification. Little is known of the early life traits of flounder and the affect early benthic life has on habitat use patterns and survival. Otolith microstructure analysis established critical baseline data on the timing and duration of early life history events of juvenile flounder. <b>Peak</b> <b>hatching</b> and settlement occurred in February/March and March/April respectively while the average pelagic larval phase was on average 43 days. Spatial and temporal variability in early life history traits and size were identified which may be related to inter/intra estuarine movement of flounder and/or selective mortality of different settlement cohorts. Flounder sampled from beaches and estuaries within Galway Bay showed different habitat use patterns. Individuals on the beaches used the habitat over {{a short period of time}} and were either moving away from the beach habitat or undergoing mortality subsequent to arrival; whereas flounder were continuously found in the estuaries until late summer. There is evidence that biochemical (RNA:DNA) and morphometric condition represent different time scales in fishes’ life which can be useful for studying short and long term condition of fish. Under experimental laboratory conditions, post larval flounder held at salinity of 30 had higher RNA: DNA compared to individuals held at salinity of 0 while no difference in morphometric condition was detected. In contrast, in the estuarine environment flounder condition (morphometric and RNArDNA) increased as salinity decreased. The findings of this thesis provided important information on the dynamics of 0 -group flounder which can aid conservation of essential juvenile habitats which in turn can positively affect recruitment of 0 -group individuals to the adult spawning population...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) has {{suffered}} significant population declines across its entire geographic range and the mechanisms {{associated with this}} decline are poorly understood. Although much of the Rusty Blackbird breeding habitat in Alaska has remained relatively unaltered by anthropogenic activities, this species continues to decline by an estimated 5 % annually. As part of a collaborative effort to obtain data on the reproductive ecology, breeding success, and habitat requirements of this species throughout their range, a total of 42 nests were found and monitored for two consecutive breeding seasons (2009 – 2010) on the Copper River Delta in south-central Alaska. Nests were monitored every 2 - 4 days to calculate nest success, survival rates, clutch initiation date, clutch size, egg viability, and fledging rates. In 2010, chick provisioning rates, chick diet, and aquatic invertebrate availability in Rusty Blackbird foraging habitats were also investigated. Mean clutch size ranged from 5 to 7 eggs both years (2009 = 5. 41 ± 0. 15, 2010 = 5. 67 ± 0. 13). Daily nest survival rate averaged over both seasons was high, at 0. 9913 ± 0. 0043 (95 % CI 0. 9772 - 0. 9967) and most eggs were viable (N = 31 nests), with 0. 8922 ± 0. 0275 of eggs over both seasons hatching. Approximately 85 % of clutches were initiated within a two week period for both years of the study. Clutch-initiation date (CID) was significantly different between years (p-value < 0. 0001), with mean CID of 10 May (x̅ = 10. 476 ± 0. 95) in 2010 and May 18 (x̅ = 18. 421 ± 1. 13) in 2009. The mean provisioning rate was 0. 84 (± 0. 06; 95 % CI: 0. 72 to 0. 95) invertebrate food items per chick per hour. Large odonate nymphs, specifically dragonflies, made up the bulk (97. 2 %) of the observed food items provisioned to chicks. Weekly pond sampling revealed four taxonomic groups of invertebrates that were of the size observed provisioned to chicks (Coleoptera, Hirudinea, Zygoptera, Anisoptera) and Anisoptera were among the rarest collected (16. 2 %) of this size. Although the least common large invertebrate collected, Anisoptera nymphs were present in all weekly samples.

After 5 days, commercial grower and finisher diets were provided. Pre-starter composition influenced body weight until slaughter age, although not statistically verifiable. Broilers fed the low protein (LP) pre-starter had the lowest body weight in relation to chickens on the low carbohydrate or low fat pre-starter diet. After hatch, chicks on the LP pre-starter diet were able to use the residual yolk sac more rapidly to fulfil their protein requirement, which is reflected in small intestine and liver development. Also, plasma metabolite levels were influenced mostly by the LP pre-starter, indicating that the main focus for the requirements of newly hatched chicks should be on proteins.

Annual gosling production (i. e., proportional composition of young during brood-rearing) was reduced for both species when the mass of nutrient reserves for pre-breeding females arriving to nest were lighter. Mismatch between <b>peak</b> gosling <b>hatch</b> and <b>peak</b> forage quality was also related to decreases in gosling production, while delays in nest initiation negatively affected clutch size and nest success (i. e., ≥ 1 egg hatched). Vegetation phenology was significantly earlier in years with warmer spring (i. e., 25 May – 30 June) surface air temperatures. Additionally, increased mismatch {{over the course of the}} 23 -year study period apparently resulted from advancing vegetation phenology without a contemporaneous advance in goose breeding phenology. I did not find evidence of a direct effect of annual nesting population size on colony gosling production. Given an absence of information on the pre-fledging stage of the life cycle for geese originating from Karrak Lake, I studied the effect of conditions experienced during early life on the growth and survival of goslings. Time constraints due to strong seasonality at arctic-nesting grounds highlight the importance of foraging conditions (i. e., quality, quantity, availability) for offspring during brood-rearing. I found that an increase in the number of nesting geese was associated with a reduction in gosling survival for both Ross’s geese and snow geese. There was weak evidence that snow goose gosling body size was negatively related to breeding population size at the colony, while no effect was detected for Ross’s geese. Increasing mismatch between the seasonal peak in vegetation quality and timing of hatch was negatively related to both gosling size and survival probability; suggestive of nutritional stress. My results lend support to the notion that both global (i. e., climate change) and local (i. e., foraging/habitat conditions) phenomena may result in reduced offspring production and success, and alludes to the possibility of an eventual decline in recruitment into the breeding cohort...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{susceptibility}} of {{the first}} three larval stages of Spodoptera exigua to Bacillus thuringiensis was investigated. To determine the LC 50 values for each larval instar, 6 different logarithmic concentrations of Bacillus thuringiensis were used. A control was also included in each of the bioassays. The value of LC 50 for 1 st instar larvae, that had been treated one to four hours after hatching, was 311. 617 ppm. For the 2 nd and third instars, the larvae values of LC 50 were 1356. 95 and 2708. 27 ppm, respectively. It was clear that larval susceptibility to Bacillus thuringiensis decreased with age. In order to enhance the Bacillus thuringiensis efficiency to control Spodoptera exigua under field conditions, Bacillus thuringiensis should be applied at egg <b>hatch</b> <b>peaks...</b>|$|R
40|$|Myostatin (MSTN) is {{a pivotal}} protein that regulates {{vertebrate}} muscle growth and development. Teleost fish possess two MSTN paralogs (MSTN- 1 and MSTN- 2) whose respective physiological functions are still largely unclear. To clarify {{the role of}} each of these paralogs the transcript abundance of Mstn- 1 and Mstn- 2 was quantified during embryonic and larval development of the teleosts, barramundi, Lates calcarifer. Histological analyses of developing muscle fibers were also obtained to correlate Mstn paralog expression with muscle hypertrophy as larvae undergo metamorphosis. Mstn- 1 and Mstn- 2 transcripts were detected as early as immediately postfertilization of eggs, with the level of expression observed to increase during embryonic development and reach a <b>peak</b> near <b>hatching.</b> Mstn- 2 expression was thousands-fold higher than that observed for Mstn- 1. Close to metamorphosis, the expression of Mstn- 1 was non-significantly, although positively associated, with muscle hypertrophy (r = 0. 384, p = 0. 064), while that of Mstn- 2 showed a highly significant negative correlation (r = − 0. 691, p < 0. 0001) suggesting that this paralog may be responsible for muscle hypertrophy that occurs post-metamorphosis. Altogether, findings from this study support the hypothesis that Mstn paralogs are differentially regulated during various phases of fish development and that they may have evolved different functions in fish, particularly that related to muscle hypertrophy...|$|R
40|$|Thyroid hormones {{are closely}} linked to the {{hatching}} process in precocial birds. Previously, we showed that thyroid hormones in brain had a strong impact on filial imprinting, an early learning behavior in newly hatched chicks; brain 3, 5, 3 '-triiodothyronine (T 3) <b>peaks</b> around <b>hatching</b> and imprinting training induces additional T 3 release, thus, extending the sensitive period for imprinting and enabling subsequent other learning. On the other hand, blood thyroid hormone levels have been reported to increase gradually after hatching in altricial species, but it remains unknown how the brain thyroid hormone levels change during post-hatching development of altricial birds. Here, we determined the changes in serum and brain thyroid hormone levels of a passerine songbird species, the zebra finch using radioimmunoassay. In the serum, we found a gradual increase in thyroid hormone levels during post-hatching development, as well as differences between male and female finches. In the brain, there was clear surge in the hormone levels during development in males and females coinciding with the time of fledging, but the onset of the surge of thyroxine (T 4) in males preceded that of females, whereas the onset of the surge of T 3 in males succeeded that of females. These findings provide a basis for understanding the functions of thyroid hormones during early development and learning in altricial birds...|$|R
40|$|The dogwood borer, Synanthedon scitula (Harris), is a {{relatively}} new pest problem on apples. Larvae feed principally in burr knots on the above-ground portion of clonal rootstocks. According to a survey of 33 orchards on dwarf or semidwarf apple root-stocks, about 70 % of the trees had burr knots. The tendency to develop burr knots was similar among the rootstocks examined in this survey. The proportion of trees infested with dogwood borer in an orchard ranged from 0 to 100 % and averaged 30 %. The dogwood borer overwinters in the larval stage (2 nd to 6 th instar) and pupates in the feeding tunnel. Emergence and pheromone-trap records indicate 1 generation a year. In western New York, adults begin to emerge in mid-June, peak in mid-July, and continue to emerge through September. In several tests conducted over a 3 -year period, chlorpyrifos at 180 g/ 100 L provided the most consistent control. At this rate a single spray timed to first or <b>peak</b> egg <b>hatch</b> was as effective as 2 sprays. Latex paint applied by brush to the trunk {{at the beginning of the}} oviposition period also reduced the infestation. In established plantings, dogwood borer can also be controlled by berming with soil up to the graft union to prevent access to burr knots. Destroying burr knots chemically with naphthalene acetic acid will not eliminate an infestation and may invite other borer problem...|$|R
40|$|Many organisms show {{adaptive}} {{phenotypic plasticity}} {{in response to}} environmental variation. Some environmental factors may, however, impose constraints {{on the ability of}} organisms to respond to other factors. The neotropical treefrog Dendropsophus ebraccatus lays eggs both above water on leaves and directly in water, thereby exposing embryos to different abiotic conditions and predator communities. Rising pond levels can also flood arboreal clutches after rainstorms. We tested for predator-induced hatching in submerged and arboreal D. ebraccatus egg masses and assessed effects of prior hydration or desiccation on escape success in attacks by a terrestrial predator, Azteca ants, and an aquatic predator, large conspecific tadpoles. Embryos responded to both aquatic and terrestrial predator attacks by hatching prematurely, as much as 67 % earlier than the <b>peak</b> of <b>hatching</b> in undisturbed clutches. Desiccation reduced the hatching response of terrestrial embryos, resulting in substantially lower escape rates. This desiccation effect disappeared rapidly with flooding; all embryos showed high escape hatching success underwater. The occurrence of predator-induced escape hatching in response to 2 different predators, in 2 different physical environments, suggests that this is a general response of D. ebraccatus to egg predator attack. Both ant attack and sublethal desiccation are common in nature, thus the inhibition of escape hatching in this context likely impacts tadpole recruitment. More generally, we demonstrate that an adaptive plastic response to risk is contingent on additional environmental variables and suggest that many instances of plasticity may similarly be modified by environmental constraints.

40|$|Arboreal red-eyed treefrog embryos can hatch prematurely in {{response}} to egg predators. Induced early hatchlings face aquatic predators when less developed and for longer than do later hatchlings; both factors may alter survival through the high-risk early larval period. Prior work focused on developmental effects of induced hatching. In 24 h trials, less developed hatchlings were more vulnerable to three aquatic predators (shrimp, fish, water bugs) but had similar or better survival than full-term hatchlings with libellulid and aeschnid dragonfly nymphs. However, it is unknown how developmental effects and duration of exposure to predators combine to create {{the net effect of}} early hatching. Here we measured costs of early hatching over a 72 h period, from first <b>hatching</b> competence past <b>peak</b> spontaneous <b>hatching.</b> Embryos hatched at age 4 or 6 days were exposed to water bugs, aeshnids, or libellulids. Early-hatched tadpoles suffered higher mortality than late hatchlings with all three predators. The longer exposure of early hatchlings to aquatic predators reversed their initial phenotypic advantage with aeshnids and revealed a cost of early hatching with libellulids where none was apparent from phenotypes alone. In other experiments, early-hatched tadpoles reared without predators grew more quickly than those reared with predators cues, which grew more quickly than age-matched embryos, revealing phenotypic effects of both predator cues and the egg vs. aquatic environment. Nonetheless, any potential benefits of predator-induced phenotypes on tadpole survival were insufficient to compensate for the increased duration of predator exposure that is a consequence of hatching early.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{possible}} {{underlying causes of}} the wide interannual fluctuations in catch of the common octopus Octopus vulgaris Cuvier, 1797 {{in one of the}} main small-scale fisheries off the coast of Galicia (northwest Spain). Galicia is at the northern boundary of the Iberian–Canary current upwelling system in the northeast Atlantic Ocean, where local winds induce seasonal upwelling, largely driving the annual cycles of primary and secondary production. We hypothesize that such dynamics are also fundamental for the survival of the planktonic stages of octopus and set the year class strength. We address this hypothesis by investigating the influence of upwelling on time-series of octopus fishery data. Wind stress structure during the spring–summer (prior to the <b>hatching</b> <b>peak)</b> and autumn–winter (during the planktonic stage) was found to affect the early life phase of this species, and explains up to 85 % of the total variance of the year-to-year variability of the adult catch. Despite this bottom-up modulation via environmental conditions, our results also provide evidence for a between-cohort density-dependent interaction, probably caused by cannibalism and competition for habitat.

40|$|The two potato cyst {{nematode}} species, Globodera pallida and G. rostochiensis, {{are among the most}} important pests of potato. PCN are difficult to manage, while the two species respond differently to the main control methods. An increase in the incidence of G. pallida had been reported and is generally attributed to greater effectiveness of control measures against G. rostochiensis. The status of PCN in Ireland was studied using PCR. The results demonstrated qPCR to be an efficient means of high-throughput PCN sampling, being able to accurately identify both species in mixed-species populations. Species discrimination using qPCR revealed an increase in the incidence of G. pallida in Ireland in the absence of G. pallida-selective control measures. The population dynamics of G. pallida and G. rostochiensis in Ireland were studied in mixed- and single-species competition assays in vivo. G. pallida proved to be the more successful species, with greater multiplication in mixed- than single-species populations, with G. rostochiensis showing the opposite. This effect was similarly observed in staggered inoculation trials and population proportion trials. It was hypothesised that the greater G. pallida competitiveness could be attributed to its later hatch. G. pallida exhibited a later <b>peak</b> in <b>hatching</b> activity and more prolonged hatch, relative to G. rostochiensis. G. rostochiensis hatch was significantly reduced in mixedspecies hatching assays. G. pallida hatch was significantly higher when hatch was induced in potato root leachates containing G. rostochiensis-specific compounds, indicating that G. pallida hatch is stimulated upon perception of G. rostochiensis–derived compounds. Rhizotron studies revealed that root damage, caused by feeding of the early-hatching G. rostochiensis, resulted in increased lateral root proliferation and significantly increased G. pallida multiplication. Split-root trials indicated a significant G. pallida-induced ISR effect. G. rostochiensis multiplication was significantly reduced in split-root rhizotrons when G. pallida colonised roots before or after G. rostochiensis infection...|$|R
40|$|First {{published}} online: 25 May 2015 We {{tested the}} effects of high humidity and submergence on egg hatching of spider mites. In both the high humidity and submergence treatments, many Tetranychus and Panonychus eggs did not hatch until after the <b>hatching</b> <b>peak</b> of the lower humidity or unsubmerged controls. However, after humidity decreased or water was drained, many eggs hatched within 1 - 3 [*]h. This was observed regardless of when high humidity or submergence treatments were implemented: either immediately after oviposition or immediately before hatching was due. Normal eyespot formation was observed in most eggs in the high humidity and submergence treatments, which indicates that spider mite embryos develop even when eggs are underwater. Therefore, delays in hatching are not caused by delayed embryonic development. A delay in hatching was always observed in Panonychus citri (McGregor) but was more variable in Tetranychus urticae Koch and Tetranychus kanzawai Kishida. The high humidity and submergence treatments affected but did not suppress larval development in these species. In contrast, many Oligonychus eggs died following the high humidity treatments.

The plants were grown in buried, one meter deep, containers filled with a Nicollet loam (Aquic Hapludoll) soil. A rainout shelter protected the plots from the interruption of water deficit by rainfall. Irrigation was scheduled so that the plants experienced water deficit during the <b>peak</b> egg <b>hatch</b> {{of the first and}} second European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner) generations. Water deficit during the vegetative period delayed leaf appearance and tasseling, reduced the area of individual leaves and plant height, but did not affect total leaf number. Thermal time requirement per leaf was different for the two years due to the interactive effect of photoperiod and cool temperatures. The lowest grain yields were observed when water deficit was imposed around tasseling. Biomass yield was lowest with vegetative period water deficit, {{but there was also a}} significant reduction when water deficit was imposed during the reproductive period. The amount of stalk tunneling by corn borer larvae was not different between water deficit treatments, but Bt plants had significantly less tunneling by the second-generation larvae than non-Bt plants. Stressed and non-stressed plants differed significantly in leaf temperature, stomatal conductance and sap flow, but Bt and non-Bt plants did not. It was concluded that the introduction of the Bt gene into maize plants for a better resistance to European corn borer did not affect their water relations. Transpiration measured by the sap flow technique was well correlated with Penman potential evapotranspiration, suggesting that this method is more suitable than porometry or infrared thermometry for plant transpiration measurements under varying environmental conditions. A stress index was derived from transpiration measured 15 to 18 days after silking which could be used as a simple yield forecasting tool by decision makers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{codling moth}} (CM), Cydia pomonella (L.), causes heavy damage in Bulgarian apple orchards. Conventionally treated orchards, were {{monitored}} in this study. In spite of numerous chemical treatments, these orchards showed increasing flight densities of CM moths, growing populations of hibernating larvae and rising fruit damage rates. Thus, {{the control of}} CM by conventional spray-ing programmes became ineffective, apparently due {{to the development of}} resistance to insecticides. Products based on the Cydia pomonella granulosis virus (CpGV), such as Madex®, may provide alternative control tools that can be applied with other approaches, for a sustainable control strategy. The trials were carried out in Central-South and South-East Bulgaria, in 2006 - 2010. Four treatments of Madex ® against the first generation, and six treatments against the second generation kept the fruit damage and population density of CM at a low level. Based on the obtained results, different control strategies have been suggested, depending on the initial CM pressure in a particular orchard. Madex ® may be a promising alternative to traditional programmes of CM control. Its dose, however, should be adjusted to the initial CM population density. Also, at a high or moderate CM population density Madex ® applications should be combined with MD to avoid resistance of CM to granulovirus. At the <b>peak</b> of CM <b>hatching,</b> additional chemical treatments may be sometimes necessary. Such treatments include using insecticides which are still effective against CM...|$|R
