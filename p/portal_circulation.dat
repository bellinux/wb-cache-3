25|$|Pathological {{anastomosis}} {{results from}} trauma or disease and may involve veins, arteries, or intestines. These are usually {{referred to as}} fistulas. In the cases of veins or arteries, traumatic fistulas usually occur between artery and vein. Traumatic intestinal fistulas usually occur between two loops of intestine (entero-enteric fistula) or intestine and skin (enterocutaneous fistula). Portacaval anastomosis, by contrast, is an anastomosis between a vein of the <b>portal</b> <b>circulation</b> and a vein of the systemic circulation, which allows blood to bypass the liver in patients with portal hypertension, often resulting in hemorrhoids, esophageal varices, or caput medusae.|$|E
25|$|Once the IF/B12 {{complex is}} {{recognized}} by specialized ileal receptors, it is transported into the <b>portal</b> <b>circulation.</b> The vitamin is {{then transferred to}} transcobalamin II (TC-II/B12), which serves as the plasma transporter. Hereditary defects in production of the transcobalamins and their receptors may produce functional deficiencies in B12 and infantile megaloblastic anemia, and abnormal B12 related biochemistry, even in some cases with normal blood B12 levels. For the vitamin to serve inside cells, the TC-II/B12 complex must bind to a cell receptor, and be endocytosed. The transcobalamin-II is degraded within a lysosome, and free B12 is finally released into the cytoplasm, where it may be transformed into the proper coenzyme, by certain cellular enzymes (see above).|$|E

25|$|Copper {{released}} from intestinal cells {{moves to the}} serosal (i.e., thin membrane lining) capillaries where it binds to albumin, glutathione, and amino acids in the portal blood. There is also evidence for a small protein, transcuprein, with a specific role in plasma copper transport Several {{or all of these}} copper-binding molecules may participate in serum copper transport. Copper from <b>portal</b> <b>circulation</b> is primarily taken up by the liver. Once in the liver, copper is either incorporated into copper-requiring proteins, which are subsequently secreted into the blood. Most of the copper (70 – 95%) excreted by the liver is incorporated into ceruloplasmin, the main copper carrier in blood. Copper is transported to extra-hepatic tissues by ceruloplasmin, albumin and amino acids, or excreted into the bile. By regulating copper release, the liver exerts homeostatic control over extrahepatic copper.|$|E
25|$|Choline in food {{exists in}} either a free or esterified form (choline bound within another compound, such as phosphatidylcholine, through an ester linkage). Although all forms are most likely usable, some {{evidence}} indicates they are unequally bioavailable (able {{to be used by}} the body). Lipid-soluble forms (such as phosphytidylcholine) bypass the liver once absorbed, while water-soluble forms (such as free choline) enter the liver <b>portal</b> <b>circulation</b> and are generally absorbed by the liver. Both pregnancy and lactation increase demand for choline dramatically. This demand may be met by upregulation of PEMT via increasing estrogen levels to produce more choline de novo, but even with increased PEMT activity, the demand for choline is still so high that bodily stores are generally depleted. This is exemplified by the observation that Pemt -/- mice (mice lacking functional PEMT) will abort at 9–10 days unless fed supplemental choline.|$|E
500|$|A transjugular {{intrahepatic}} portosystemic shunt (TIPS) {{involves the}} decompression {{of the high}} pressures in the <b>portal</b> <b>circulation</b> by placing a small stent between a portal and hepatic vein. This is done through radiologically guided catheters which are passed into the hepatic vein either through the internal jugular vein or the femoral vein. [...] Theoretically, a decrease in portal pressures is thought to reverse the hemodynamic phenomena that ultimately {{lead to the development}} of hepatorenal syndrome. [...] TIPS has been shown to improve kidney function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome. [...] Complications of TIPS for treatment of HRS include the worsening of hepatic encephalopathy (as the procedure involves the forced creation of a porto-systemic shunt, effectively bypassing the ability of the liver to clear toxins), inability to achieve adequate reduction in portal pressure, and bleeding.|$|E
50|$|FGF15 {{is found}} in the {{absorptive}} cells of the mouse ileum and {{plays an important role in}} feedback inhibition of hepatic bile acid synthesis. FGF15 (and FGF19 in humans) function as hormones produced in response to bile acid absorption acting on the farnesoid X receptor FXR, are secreted into the <b>portal</b> venous <b>circulation</b> and bind onto the liver membrane receptor FGFR4/β-Klotho and repress bile acid synthesis by the Cyp7a1 gene.|$|R

2500|$|Alcoholic {{hepatitis}} {{is characterized}} by the inflammation of hepatocytes. Between 10% and 35% of heavy drinkers develop alcoholic hepatitis (NIAAA, 1993). [...] While development of hepatitis is not directly related to the dose of alcohol, some people seem more prone to this reaction than others. [...] This is called alcoholic steato necrosis and the inflammation appears to predispose to liver fibrosis. Inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL6 and IL8) are thought to be essential in the initiation and perpetuation of liver injury by inducing apoptosis and necrosis. One possible mechanism for the increased activity of TNF-α is the increased intestinal permeability due to liver disease. This facilitates the absorption of the gut-produced endotoxin into the <b>portal</b> <b>circulation.</b> The Kupffer cells of the liver then phagocytose endotoxin, stimulating the release of TNF-α. TNF-α then triggers apoptotic pathways through the activation of caspases, resulting in cell death.|$|E
2500|$|DL-Phenylalanine (DLPA) is {{marketed as}} a {{nutritional}} supplement for its purported analgesic and antidepressant activities. [...] DL-Phenylalanine {{is a mixture}} of D-phenylalanine and L-phenylalanine. The reputed analgesic activity of DL-phenylalanine may be explained by the possible blockage by D-phenylalanine of enkephalin [...] degradation by the enzyme carboxypeptidase A. The mechanism of DL-phenylalanine's supposed antidepressant activity may be accounted for by the precursor role of L-phenylalanine in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine. Elevated brain levels of norepinephrine and dopamine are thought to have an antidepressant effect. [...] D-Phenylalanine is absorbed from the small intestine and transported to the liver via the <b>portal</b> <b>circulation.</b> A small amount of D-phenylalanine appears to be converted to L-phenylalanine. D-Phenylalanine is distributed to the various tissues of the body via the systemic circulation. It appears to cross the blood–brain barrier less efficiently than L-phenylalanine, and so a small amount of an ingested dose of D-phenylalanine is excreted in the urine without penetrating the central nervous system.|$|E

The objective {{of this study is to}} prove if virgin coconut oil can influence the trigliseride and total cholesterol serum of wistar after induction of atherogenesis. Method: An experimental study using post test only control group design. The sample were 16 male aged 20 weeks Wistar, with simple random sampling allocated into two groups (group I and II). Group I as control and group II that was treatment group, given vco with a dose of 0, 00345 ml/gr BW. On the 56 th day, the blood were taken from all wistar then have measured. The collected data was primary data from the result of measurement of trigliseride serum with GPO methode and total cholesterol with CHOD-PAP method. This data were analyzed by independent T-test. Result: It was shown in this study that the trigliseride and total cholesterol serum of the treaten group was significantly lower than control (p< 0, 01).

50|$|A TIPS {{procedure}} {{decreases the}} effective vascular {{resistance of the}} liver {{through the creation of}} an alternative pathway for <b>portal</b> venous <b>circulation.</b> By creating a shunt from the portal vein to the hepatic vein, this intervention allows portal blood an alternative avenue for draining into systemic circulation. In bypassing the flow-resistant liver, the net result is a reduced pressure drop across the liver and a decreased portal venous pressure. Decreased portal venous pressure in turn lessens congestive pressures along veins in the intestine so that future bleeding is less likely to occur. The reduced pressure also makes less fluid develop, although this benefit may take weeks or months to occur.|$|R
