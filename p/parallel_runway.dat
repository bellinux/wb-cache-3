5|$|By the 1970s {{the airport}} was again {{in need of}} {{expansion}} and modernization. In 1973 the newly created Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority (MNAA) finalized a master plan to coordinate the long-term growth of the airport along projected increases in needed passenger capacity. This plan included {{the building of a}} new terminal and a new <b>parallel</b> <b>runway</b> across Donelson Pike to handle increasing operations by reducing the time between consecutive takeoffs and landings.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, {{the company}} has {{invested}} heavily in extending aprons and creating rapid exit taxiways to derive maximum efficiency from the existing main runway. Runway 11/29, the shortest {{and one of the}} oldest runways, is closed to allow overspill aircraft parking. This runway will disappear under the new <b>parallel</b> <b>runway</b> in due course.|$|E
25|$|Several {{options to}} expand Gatwick have been considered, {{including}} a third terminal {{and a second}} runway {{to the south of}} the existing runway. This would allow Gatwick to handle more passengers than Heathrow does today. If a second, wide-spaced (as opposed to close <b>parallel)</b> <b>runway</b> is approved, a new terminal could be sited between the two runways. This could either complement or replace the current South Terminal, depending on expected future traffic developments.|$|E

25|$|The airport's {{master plan}} calls for a fourth (third <b>parallel)</b> <b>runway</b> to be built {{southeast}} of I-70 sometime in the future. Between 2002 and 2004 the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) rebuilt a portion of this Interstate highway running through {{the south end of}} the airport's property. The realigned freeway allows a future taxiway bridge to the proposed fourth runway to cross overhead and has a new traffic interchange for the midfield terminal complex. This I-70 exit (#68) is now the airport's main entrance, replacing the entrance at Sam Jones Expressway (which was built as the Airport Expressway) and High School Road. Provision has been made for future Light Rail Transit (LRT) access to the Weir Cook terminal complex.|$|E
25|$|With a {{new airport}} under consideration, {{the project for}} a <b>parallel</b> <b>runway</b> {{has been put on}} hold and the total land {{required}} for the airport expansion reduced from 1,069.99 acres to 800 acres. AAI planned to operate 2,400m even after removing obstructions. About 2,085m of the runway was earlier used for landing only smaller aircraft, like ATR types. In February 2012, airport authorities announced that only about 2,160m of the secondary runway would be operational as there will be 330m permanent displacement at GST road side and 780m displacement at the other end. This restricted length would be enough to operate Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 aircraft without load penalty. Bad planning by the airport authorities, which has resulted in the removal of the very-high-frequency omni range equipment (VOR) from its original location where a link way has been constructed between the main and the secondary runways, has been considered the reason behind the delay.|$|E
25|$|On Woodlark, the {{construction}} of Woodlark Airfield was begun by 20th and 60th US Naval Construction Battalions on 2 July and by 14 July the airfield consisted of single 3,000 feet (910 m) x 150 feet (46 m) runway which could accommodate Douglas C-47 Skytrains. By 21 July the runway was expanded to 5,200 feet (1584 m) of runway and a coral surface with the 67th Fighter Squadron arriving on 23 July. The airfield was ultimately extended to 6,500 feet (2,000 m) x 225 feet (69 m) with a <b>parallel</b> <b>runway</b> of 6,000 feet (1,800 m) x 60 feet (18 m) together with 110 hardstands. The airfield {{was used as a}} stopover point and refuelling point. Defensive positions were set up around Woodlark with antiaircraft and coast artillery pieces of the 12th Defense Battalion being installed, and machine gun and 37mm beach positions established. A PT boat and landing craft repair base was also constructed at Guasopa Bay and the island was also used as a supply base.|$|E

40|$|Key words: closed spaced {{parallel}} runways; paired departure; acceleration error; collision risk Abstract. Paired departure to closed spaced <b>parallel</b> <b>runways</b> {{can effectively}} improve capacity of terminal, and also can solve congestion of busy airport, {{but it also}} increases the complexity of air traffic control. For ensuring safety operation of paired departure, the longitudinal collision risk of paired departure to closed spaced <b>parallel</b> <b>runways</b> was studied. Based on the acceleration error distribution and requirements on wake avoidance during paired departure, a longitudinal collision risk safety assessment model of closed spaced <b>parallel</b> <b>runways</b> paired departure was built. The parameters in this model were determined by providing the calculation models. In the end, an example was calculated to verify the model, {{and it turns out}} that this model is feasible. 1 Introduction With the rapid development of the air transport industry, most of the domestic airport, especially hub airports are facing increasingly serious traffic congestion problems. Paired departure to closed spaced <b>parallel</b> <b>runways</b> can effectively improve capacity of terminal, however, due to closed spaced <b>parallel</b> <b>runways</b> distance between the two runways is less than 760 m, it increases the complexity of runway operation. There were significant differences between paired departure an...|$|R
500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s the MNAA {{commissioned}} Robert Lamb Hart, {{in association with}} the firm of Gresham, Smith and Partners, to design a modern terminal; construction began in 1984 and was completed in 1987. It had three main concourses and a smaller commuter concourse radiating from a distinctive three-story atrium. An international wing was built in Concourse A; the airport was renamed Nashville International Airport/Berry Field. [...] It is now rare to see the [...] "Berry Field" [...] portion used, but the airport's IATA code (BNA) is short for Berry Field Nashville, and the military facilities at the airport are still commonly known by this name. [...] In 1989 a new <b>parallel</b> <b>runway</b> (2R/20L) was opened for use.|$|E
500|$|Saidor had an {{existing}} grass civilian airstrip. Before they had abandoned it in 1942, Australian troops had sabotaged the airstrip by digging trenches across the runway. These were quickly filled in, and the overgrown Kunai grass was flattened by driving 2½-ton trucks over it. By {{the afternoon of}} 4 January, [...] of runway was ready for use. A Piper Cub took off from it the next day. [...] The 863rd Engineer Aviation Battalion arrived on 9 January and improved the strip, permitting twelve C-47 Skytrains loaded with ammunition to land on 11 January. Alamo Force wanted an all-weather runway [...] by , preferably where a second, <b>parallel</b> <b>runway</b> could be constructed if need be. Construction of the second runway was requested by the Fifth Air Force on 24 January. The 8th Engineer Squadron survey detachment laid out a new runway oriented about 10° from the existing airstrip.|$|E
500|$|At {{both ends}} of the runway, the taxiway ends [...] {{from the start of the}} runway, forcing {{aircraft}} which need the full length to backtrack. An extension of the taxiways would help with this problem. Both at Terminal A and B, there will be a need for double taxiways. This will result in insufficient space for general aviation at its current location, and this has been proposed moved eastwards past the military installations. Several airlines, in particular Helitrans, has indicated need for more space. Proposals have been made to establish a heliport to allow flight to oil platforms on the Norwegian continental shelf. The military has suggested to fill in a large section of the river delta at the west end of the runway, and move some of the cargo and helicopter operations there, but environmental concerns have been raised by among others Avinor. The cost of establishing access to the artificial land is also high. By 2050, there may be need for a second, <b>parallel</b> <b>runway</b> to meet demand, and initial plans call for a [...] runway which would be used by general aviation, regional airlines and helicopters.|$|E

2500|$|The airport's {{terminal}} {{until the}} 1970s was located off Virginia Avenue, {{on the north}} side of the airport. It was designed around six pier concourses radiating from a central building. Construction began on the present midfield terminal in January 1977 under the administration of Mayor Maynard Jackson. It was the largest construction project in the South, costing $500 million. The complex was designed by Stevens & Wilkinson, Smith Hinchman & Grylls, and Minority Airport Architects & Planners. Renamed for former Atlanta mayor William B. Hartsfield, who did much to promote air travel, the airport reopened on September 21, 1980, on-time and under budget. It was designed to accommodate up to 55 million passengers per year and covered 2.5 million square feet (230,000 m²). In December 1984 a [...] fourth <b>parallel</b> <b>runway</b> was completed and another runway was extended to [...] the following year.|$|E

Airport planners advanced proposals which would extend the airport's runways by adding up to [...] of fill to San Francisco Bay and increase their separation by up to [...] in 1998 to accommodate arrivals and departures during periods of low visibility. Other proposals included three floating runways, each approximately [...] long and [...] wide. The airport would be required by law to restore Bay land elsewhere in the Bay Area to offset the fill. One mitigation proposal would have the airport purchase and restore the [...] of South Bay wetlands owned by Cargill Salt to compensate for the new fill. These expansion proposals met resistance from environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, fearing damage to the habitat of animals near the airport, recreational degradation (such as windsurfing) and bay water quality.|$|E
