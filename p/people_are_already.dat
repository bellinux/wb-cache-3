25|$|A draft risk {{assessment}} released by Health Canada in July 2016 {{has found that}} overexposure to boric acid {{has the potential to}} cause developmental and reproductive health effects. Since <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> exposed to boric acid naturally through their diets and water, Health Canada advised that exposure from other sources should be reduced as much as possible, especially for children and pregnant women. The concern is not with any one product, but rather multiple exposures from a variety of sources. With this in mind, the department also announced that registrations for certain pesticides that contain boric acid, which are commonly used in homes, will have their registrations cancelled and be phased out of the marketplace. As well, new, more protective label directions are being introduced for other boric acid pesticides that continue to be registered in Canada (for example, enclosed bait stations and spot treatments using gel formulations).|$|E

500|$|The video {{features}} appearances by Beyoncé's sister Solange Knowles, {{her background}} dancers, including French dancing duo Les Twins, and her all-female band. Houston-located rapper Nosaprise {{also makes a}} cameo appearance. The video opens with Beyoncé and her sister riding lowrider bicycles, getting to a roller rink where several <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> gathered. Shots of people roler-skating inside the rink with disco balls {{hanging from the ceiling}} follow. The singer is then seen performing a dance with several background dancers as they hold rollers in their hands and enter a place called [...] "Roller City USA". Beyoncé starts skating and performing dance moves in slow-motion with several of her dancers dressed in shorts and T-shirts. Several scenes which are shot in bright black light follow as Beyoncé performs another dance sequence along with her dancers on their rollers. The second, more uptempo part of the song starts and the singer is seen arriving with a vehicle in front of a place called [...] "Cherry". She dances atop the car and dances with her background band as they play the song on their keytars. As the song progresses, smoke starts appearing {{out of the car and}} on the scene where she is with her band. During the end of the video, Beyoncé and her sister are seen going away on the same path by which they came. Close-up shots of Beyoncé lip-syncing the song are intertwined in the video with her lips covered with a shiny lipstick.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{in order}} to do this sum and {{recompose}} the number, now the addition tables for the duodecimal system have to be used, instead of the addition tables for decimal most <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> familiar with, because the summands are now in base twelve and so the arithmetic with them has to be in duodecimal as well. In decimal, 6 + 6 equals 12, but in duodecimal it equals 10; so, if using decimal arithmetic with duodecimal numbers one would arrive at an incorrect result. Doing the arithmetic properly in duodecimal, one gets the result: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 255, when Jiang Wei {{announced}} {{his plan to}} the Shu imperial court to launch another campaign against Wei, the general Zhang Yi openly objected to Jiang Wei's idea and said, [...] "Given that our state is small and our <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> living in hardship, this isn't the time for us go to war." [...] Jiang Wei ignored him and led a Shu army comprising {{tens of thousands of}} troops, with Zhang Yi and Xiahou Ba as his deputies, to attack Wei. In the eighth lunar month, the Shu army reached Fuhan County (枹罕縣; northeast of present-day Linxia County, Gansu) and prepared to attack Didao (狄道; present-day Lintao County, Gansu).|$|E

Hermann Göring {{was told by the}} experts, from Daimler-Benz, Henschel and Mauser that one aero engine factory in the Moscow region was six times larger than six of Germany's largest factories put together. Göring was furious with the report, and dismissed it. He believed they had fallen for a Soviet bluff. Intelligence reports regarded as negative by the OKL were usually dismissed.

2500|$|Homeless {{people can}} also provide waste {{management}} services to earn money. Some homeless people find returnable bottles and cans {{and bring them to}} recycling centres to earn money. For example, they can sort out organic trash from other trash, and/or separate out trash made of the same material (for example, different types of plastics, and different types of metal). Especially in Brazil, many <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> engaged in such activities. In addition, rather than sorting waste at landfills, ... they can also collect litter found on/beside the road to earn an income. Homeless people have been known to commit crimes just to be sent to jail or prison for food and shelter. In police slang, this is called [...] "three hots and a cot" [...] referring to the three daily meals and a mattress to sleep on which are given to prisoners.|$|E
2500|$|HR {{holds that}} the {{therapeutic}} [...] "working through" [...] of personal issues from the past to achieve wholeness is unnecessary. According to the HR model, <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> whole and healthy. The traumas of the past are only important {{to the extent that}} the individual lets them influence his or her thoughts in the present. According to HR, one's [...] "issues" [...] and memories are just thoughts, and the individual can react to them or not. The more the clients' experience is that they themselves are creating their own painful feelings via their own [...] "power of Thought," [...] HR suggests, the less these feelings bother them. Sedgeman has compared this to what happens when we make scary faces at ourselves in the mirror: because we know it is just us, it is impossible to scare ourselves that way.|$|E

The reason, we must be careful to guard against the Tungans, we must intensively oppose them, cannot afford to be polite, since the Tungans have compelled us to follow this way. Yellow Han people have not the slightest {{thing to do with}} Eastern Turkestan. Black Tungans also do not have this connection. Eastern Turkestan belongs to the people of Eastern Turkestan.

60|$|Aug. 21, 1873.—An {{appeal to}} me was made to {{introduce}} board schools into Hawarden on account of my share in the Education Act. I stated the two views held by different supporters of the Act, respectively {{on the question of}} board schools and voluntary schools. For myself, I said, not in education only but in all things including education, I prefer voluntary to legal machinery, when the thing can be well done either way. But this question is not to be decided by a general preference or a general formula. Parliament has referred it to the choice of the local communities. They should decide according to {{the facts of the case}} before them. What are the facts in Hawarden? Four-fifths are already provided for; were it only one-fifth or were it two-fifths the case for the board (I said) would be overwhelming. But besides the four-fifths, arrangements are already made for a further provision in a voluntary school. Nothing remains to be done except to build three infant schools. The voluntary schools will be governed by a committee, including the churchwardens, and having a majority of laymen. The machinery of a board is of necessity cumbrous, and the method costly in comparison. I hold that we ought not to set up this machinery, in order to create three infant schools, where all the other wants of some 2000 <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> provided for.|$|E

6000|$|The {{big boys}} have {{known all along}} {{that he was not}} a real country-jake; but when the trained mule begins, and shakes {{everybody}} off, just like the horse, and another country-jake gets up, and offers to bet that he can ride that mule, nobody can tell whether he is a real country-jake or not. This is always the last thing in the performance, and the boys have seen with heavy hearts many signs openly betokening the end which they knew was at hand. The actors have come out of the dressing-room door, some in their everyday clothes, and some with just overcoats on over their circus-dresses, and they lounge about near the band-stand watching the performance in the ring. Some of the <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> getting up to go out, and stand for this last act, and will not mind the shouts of [...] "Down in front! Down there!" [...] which the boys eagerly join in, to eke out their bliss a little longer by keeping away even the appearance of anything transitory in it. The country-jake comes stumbling awkwardly into the ring, but he is perfectly sober, and he boldly leaps astride the mule, which tries all its arts to shake him off, plunging, kicking, rearing. He sticks on, and everybody cheers him, and the owner of the mule begins to get mad and to make it do more things to shake the country-jake off. At last, with one convulsive spring, it flings him from its back, and dashes into the dressing-room, while the country-jake picks himself up and vanishes among the crowd.|$|E
60|$|We will suppose {{ourselves}} {{standing in}} Cornhill, on a pleasant {{morning of the}} year 1670, about the hour when the shutters are unclosed, and the dust swept from the doorsteps, and when Business rubs its eyes, and begins to plod sleepily through the town. The street, instead of running between lofty and continuous piles of brick, is but partially lined with wooden buildings of various heights and architecture, in each of which the mercantile department is connected with the domicile, like the gingerbread and candy shops of an after-date. The signs have a singular appearance to a stranger's eye. These are not a barren record of names and occupations yellow letters on black boards, but images and hieroglyphics, sometimes typifying the principal commodity offered for sale, though generally intended to give an arbitrary designation to the establishment. Overlooking the bearded Saracens, the Indian Queens, and the wooden Bibles, let its direct {{our attention to the}} white post newly erected {{at the corner of the}} street, and surmounted by a gilded countenance which flashes in the early sunbeams like veritable gold. It is a bust of AEsculapius, evidently of the latest London manufacture; and from the door behind it steams forth a mingled smell of musk and assafaetida and other drugs of potent perfume, as if an appropriate sacrifice were just laid upon the altar of the medical deity. Five or six idle <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> collected, peeping curiously in at the glittering array of gallipots and phials, and deciphering the labels which tell their contents in the mysterious and imposing nomenclature of ancient physic. They are next attracted by the printed advertisement of a Panacea, promising life but one day short of eternity, and youth and health commensurate. An old man, his head as white as snow, totters in with a hasty clattering of his staff, and becomes the earliest purchaser, hoping that his wrinkles will disappear more swiftly than they gathered. The Doctor (so styled by courtesy) shows the upper half of his person behind the counter, and appears to be a slender and rather tall man; his features are difficult to describe, possessing nothing peculiar, except a flexibility to assume all characters it, turn, while his eye, shrewd, quick, and saucy, remains the same throughout. Whenever a customer enters the shop, if he desire a box of pills, he receives with them an equal number of hard, round, dry jokes,--or if a dose of salts, it is mingled with a portion of the salt of Attica,--or if some hot, Oriental drug, it is accompanied by a racy word or two that tingle on the mental palate,--all without the least additional cost. Then there are twistings of mouths which never lost their gravity before. As each purchaser retires, the spectators see a resemblance of his visage pass over that of the apothecary, in which all the ludicrous points are made most prominent, as if a magic looking-glass had caught the reflection, and were making sport with it. Unwonted titterings arise and strengthen into bashful laughter, but are suddenly hushed as some minister, heavy-eyed from his last night's vigil, or magistrate, armed with the terror of the whipping-post and pillory, or perhaps the governor himself, goes by like a dark cloud intercepting the sunshine.|$|E
