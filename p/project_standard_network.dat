40|$|Universally {{accessible}} design aims {{to eliminate the}} barriers that standard design often presents to many groups in the world's population. in this Chapter, we look at how standards can promote universal access and design for {{the field of health}} telematics. We first discuss why standards are important and essential in the successful implementation of a universal access and design approach. Following this, the challenges that many application and system developers face in their attempts to apply standards to the design process are highlighted. The appropriate standards for the IS 4 ALL project are identified and a set of <b>project</b> <b>standards</b> for it are developed by selecting them from the larger group of identified standards and by tailoring them as needed. Strategies for implementing the <b>project</b> <b>standard</b> in a <b>project</b> will be described,, as will the outcomes of the process.

40|$|We {{present and}} develop the theory of 3 -way networks, a type of {{hypergraph}} in which each edge models relationships between triplets of objects as opposed to pairs of objects as done by <b>standard</b> <b>network</b> models. We explore approaches of how to prune these 3 -way networks, illustrate their utility in comparative genomics and demonstrate how they find rela-tionships which would be missed by <b>standard</b> 2 -way <b>network</b> models using a phylogenomic dataset of 211 bacterial genomes. Author Summary Genomes contain the information underlying the molecular functions of an organism. One way to compare the entire genomes of different organisms is to compare their gene-family content profiles which is effectively a comparison of their functional potential. <b>Standard</b> <b>networks,</b> when used to model phylogenomic similarities, are not capable of cap-turing some of the underlying complexity {{of the relationships between}} genomes. In order to address this, we have developed a new three-way similarity metric and constructed three-way networks modelling the relationships between 211 bacterial genomes. We find that such three-way networks find cross-species genomic similarities that would have been otherwise missed by simpler models such as <b>standard</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{reliability}} of substation must be high. However, once a reasonable level of reliability is achieved, {{there must be}} a means of evaluating the cost of potential changes to the substations to improve their reliabilities. Historically, the results of applying different reliability methodologies and tools varied significantly, and comparisons were difficult. The reliability analysis techniques working group of the Gold Book (IEEE Std. 493 – 1997) developed a <b>standard</b> <b>network</b> to enable comparison of analytical techniques. This paper describes the approach of simulations via reliability block diagrams as applied to the Gold Book <b>standard</b> <b>network.</b> Reliability indices of substations arrangements are presented, and are compared with each other.|$|R

The translation is compositional, i. e., it preserves {{the structure of}} computations, which allows us to abstract the concrete realizations in a monadic abstraction layer. We briefly review the By-Product and Measurement Calculus approaches to combining circuits in the one-way model, and show how the procedures can be expressed in the exact same notation, bearing a direct relationship with the representation of circuits in the <b>standard</b> <b>network</b> model, and using monads. Discussions on improving the abstraction yield us to introducing an alternative approach to combining circuits in the one-way model: a graphical one...|$|R

In 2006 WiMAX was used in China, India, Indonesia, Taiwan and the United States. In autumn 2008 Skartel was the first company in Russia to deploy WiMAX <b>standard</b> <b>network</b> in Moscow and St. Petersburg {{in a range of}} 2.5-2.7 GHz. In 2010 Yota announced its plans to launch LTE on its network. The first test start of the new <b>standard</b> <b>network</b> took place in Kazan on 30 August 2010. The subscribers gained access to the Internet at a rate of 20-30 Mbit/s. About 150 base stations have been installed in Kazan. The investments into the LTE network deployment constituted $20 million. The fourth generation LTE network, which was tested by the Yota provider in Kazan, was switched off the next day. At that point, Yota had no interest to use a 4G <b>standard</b> <b>network</b> in a commercial or test mode. Today the users of Yota have access to LTE standard Internet services in nine cities of Russia. By 2014 Yota plans to launch 4G in 180 Russian cities.|$|R
