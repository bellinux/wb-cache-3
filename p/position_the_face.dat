50|$|The spread eagle also {{refers to}} a sex {{position}} in which one partner lies on their back facing up (supine) or (less commonly) lying facing down (prone) with arms and legs spread wide apart. When the partner is lying face down, it is {{a variation of the}} doggy style position, and when they are lying face up it is a variation of the missionary position. Another variation is for the receiving partner's legs to be closed, and the penetrating partner's to be wide apart. This variation is said to be better for stimulating the G-spot and the prostate gland and is sometimes called the peace sign <b>position.</b> <b>The</b> <b>face</b> up versions of the position are popular for oral sex play or erotic massage.|$|E

We assume that the scene is populated with polyhedral objects and that a regular grid is imposed on the reference image. We describe a robust strategy that is able to merge patches that belong to the same planar surface and to impose the epipolar geometry constraints to the recovered perspective functions. ...|$|R

50|$|The pagoda {{rests on}} a low stone {{platform}} with centered steps and entrance {{on each of the}} four cardinal directions. The first and second floors contain five rooms while the third and fourth floors contain three. The fifth floor holds two rooms. In addition to the eight painted panels, there are fours statues of the Sakyamuni Buddha. Each statue has different hand <b>positions.</b> <b>The</b> Buddha <b>facing</b> east is in <b>the</b> fearless <b>position.</b> <b>The</b> Buddha <b>facing</b> west is Turning the Wheel of Dharma. <b>The</b> Buddha <b>facing</b> south is touching the earth and <b>the</b> Buddha <b>facing</b> north is in <b>the</b> reclining <b>position</b> (<b>the</b> Buddha's final state of enlightenment before his death). Within the pagoda hall can also be found 500 small white statues of the Buddha, or disciples of Buddha. Although generally acknowledged to be a pagoda, some scholars suggest that this is a hybrid of pagoda and worship hall architecture. Because pagoda architecture was brought from Korea to Japan, some hypothesize that the original Palsangjeon may have inspired and resembled the five-story pagoda at Horyu-ji.|$|R
