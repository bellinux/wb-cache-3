2500|$|The next area of {{responsibility}} involves the triage of incoming calls, <b>providing</b> <b>expert</b> systematized caller interrogation, using the script provided by the Emergency Medical Dispatch system, {{in order to determine}} the likely severity of the patient's illness or injury, so that the most appropriate type of response resource may be expedited. [...] All calls are prioritized by medical symptom/condition acuity. [...] This process may be further complicated by panic-stricken callers who scream, cry, or make unreasonable demands. [...] The trained EMD uses interpersonal and crisis management skills to sort through these distractions, taking control of the conversation, calming the caller, and extracting the necessary information. [...] This inquiry begins with the obvious questions regarding whether the patient is conscious or breathing. [...] The questioning will continue until the EMD is able to qualify a potentially life-threatening condition, at which time the closest appropriate response resource (such as a paramedic-staffed ambulance service) is notified to initiate pinpointing the call location. [...] When this occurs, the EMD will continue the questioning, attempting to gather additional relevant information, useful to determine response speed, the type of resources dispathed, or the type of equipment that the paramedics will bring to the site when they arrive. [...] In most cases, this 'pre-alert' function will not be required, and the resource will simply be dispatched when all of the required information has been gathered. [...] Ultimately, the decision on how to proceed, or when to interrupt the established process, requires the judgment of the EMD handling the call. [...] Otherwise, the manner in which this questioning proceeds is often governed by protocols, or by decision-support software.|$|E
2500|$|Notwithstanding, Burton {{began his}} thirty-nine-week tenure at The Old Vic by rehearsing for Hamlet in July 1953, with Philip <b>providing</b> <b>expert</b> {{coaching}} {{on how to}} make Hamlet's character match Burton's dynamic acting style. Burton reunited with Bloom, who played Ophelia. Hamlet opened at the Assembly Hall in Edinburgh, Scotland on September 1953 as part of The Old Vic season during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The play and Burton's Hamlet were, on the whole, well received, with critics describing his interpretation of the character as [...] "moody, virile and baleful" [...] and that he had [...] "dash, attack and verve". Burton's Hamlet was quite popular with the young audience, who came to watch the play in numbers as they were quite taken with the aggressiveness with which he portrayed the role. Burton also received appreciation from Winston Churchill. Gielgud was not too happy with Burton's Hamlet and asked him while both were backstage: [...] "Shall I go ahead and wait until you're better?... ah, I mean ready?" [...] Burton picked up the hint and infused some of Gielgud's traits to his own in later performances as Hamlet. A greater success followed {{in the form of the}} Roman General Gaius Marcius Coriolanus in Coriolanus. At first, Burton refused to play Coriolanus as he didn't like the character's initial disdain for the poor and the downtrodden. Michael Benthall, who was renowned for his association with Tyrone Guthrie in a 1944 production of Hamlet, sought Philip's help to entice Burton into accepting it. Philip convinced Burton by making him realise that it was Coriolanus' [...] "lack of ambivalence" [...] which made him an admirable character. Burton received even better reviews for Coriolanus than Hamlet. Hardy thought Burton's Hamlet was [...] "too strong" [...] but that [...] "His Coriolanus is quite easily the best I've ever seen." [...] Olivier too agreed it was the greatest Coriolanus he had ever seen till then.|$|E
