40|$|Value-based IT {{portfolio}} management requires {{the consideration of}} intertemporal interdependencies that may exist among IT projects. Therefore, several papers suggest adopting the real options approach in order to include intertemporal interdependencies within the valuation of IT projects. However, this paper shows that the standard Black-Scholes model, which is often used for valuating real options, is not appropriate to correctly account for project-specific <b>private</b> <b>risks</b> due to its restrictive assumptions. Since this can have major impacts {{on the value of}} IT projects, we develop an approach – based on the Black-Scholes model – to consider <b>private</b> <b>risks</b> properly within project valuation. A comparison {{of the results of the}} standard Black-Scholes model used today and our approach finally reveals that the neglect of <b>private</b> <b>risks</b> results in a systematic underestimation of both risk and return of IT projects, which may lead to wrong investment decisions.

40|$|In all large {{engineering}} projects, valuation {{constitutes an}} important step during the initial stage as each stakeholder assesses the prospect {{of his or her}} investment. The complexity of valuation increases dramatically in the face of uncertainty especially when the risks are dynamic and stochastic in nature. The usual classification in finance theory divides risks into either market or unique. In this research, a new notion of private risk is introduced. A private risk may either be correlated with the market or be unique, but in addition it represents a substantial portion of an investor's wealth and is not tradable due to agency costs or other strategic reasons. The principles of pricing would differ according to the treatment of these different types of risks. Methods that are currently in vogue for pricing <b>private</b> <b>risks</b> are first evaluated, followed by a study of the effect of <b>private</b> <b>risks</b> in real option problems. Through a classic oil and gas exploration and development example, it is demonstrated that the methods chosen for pricing <b>private</b> <b>risks</b> can lead to decisively different real option values, exercise strategies and development policies. Effectively, the difference in real option values can be interpreted as a form of private risk premium. Decision analysis, private risk, real option, risk, valuation,...|$|E

We allow the decision maker to rebalance his financial portfolio {{in the course of}} determination of a lottery's buying (selling) price. We build on the classical portfolio allocation problem in complete markets, generalizing to include both traded and non-traded unique risks. Our principal focus is on private risks-risks that are not tradable in financial markets. The first essay: Generalizes the treatment of the buying price and the selling price of a private risk lottery by allowing portfolio rebalancing in the course of determining these prices and Outlines the implications of this generalization for distributive bargaining. The second essay is a study of methods for pricing unique risks in real options problems. This essay is a critical evaluation of how methods currently in vogue for pricing <b>private</b> <b>risks</b> affect real option value. We build a framework for valuing investments under uncertainty in the presence of <b>private</b> <b>risks</b> and demonstrate by example that different methods for pricing private risk can lead to decisively different real option values. To this end we use the classical oil and gas exploration and development example pioneered by Paddock, Siegel and Smith(1978).

Taking into account that the increased level of risk follows long-term credits, these operations has been influenced the most, that can be {{as one of the}} constraining conditions for the provision of bank long-term credit resources. It, in turn, causes the need to develop the risk assessment technique of long-term credits in regulation of banks’ long-term credit operations. As the risk assessment of credit operations in banking practice is generally limited to the calculation of credit risk, it is efficient to consider the scientifically reasonable approach to a risks assessment of long-term crediting including influence of <b>private</b> <b>risks</b> for the purpose of carrying out the generalized assessment of riskiness both separate types of long-term credits, and a long-term credit portfolio in general. The offered method is based on the calculation of aggregate risk coefficient of the long-term credits, calculated by means of mathematical method of principal component. In the work, it is offered to perform an assessment of <b>private</b> <b>risks</b> by means of statistics: the expectation value, mean square deviation, and the coefficient of a variation. The use of the principal components’ method at the risk assessment of longterm crediting meets such requirements as a lack of value judgment, accounting of specific features of <b>private</b> <b>risks</b> of long-term credits, mathematical validity. It gives the chance to apply the offered risk assessment method of long-term credits in banking. The conclusion is made that the application of an aggregative risk indicator of a long-term crediting will allow banks to trace more accurately the level of riskiness of a long-term credit portfolio and separate types of long-term credits that will strengthen the bank information and analytical base on risk regulation in the field and will expand tools of bank management...|$|E

40|$|The real options {{approach}} to corporate investment decision making recognizes a firm can delay an investment decision {{and wait for}} more information concerning project cash-flows. The well known models of McDonald and Siegel (1986) and Dixit and Pindyck (1994) value the investment decision as a perpetual American call option on the project value. The former specifies the equilibrium return via CAPM, whilst the latter, along {{with much of the}} literature, uses a replicating portfolio argument. This involves identify-ing a perfect spanning asset for the project value, often called a “twin security”. Neither approach recognizes <b>private</b> <b>risks.</b> In this paper, we instead assume only a partial spanning asset can be found which is imperfectly correlated with project value. This is more realistic, as most real projects can only be partially hedged by traded securities and <b>private</b> <b>risks</b> are common. We find the value of the option to invest and the trigger level are both lowered (compared to the complete model) when the spanning asset is less than perfect, although the option to invest still has value even when there is no spanning asset at all. This implies the firm should wait to invest, but invest earlier than the complete real options model suggests...|$|E
40|$|In {{light of}} {{increasing}} losses from floods many researchers {{and policy makers}} {{are looking for ways}} to encourage flood risk reduction among communities, business, and households. In this study we investigate risk reduction behavior at the household level in three European Union (EU) Member States with fundamentally different insurance and compensation schemes. We try to understand if and how insurance and public assistance influence <b>private</b> <b>risk</b> reduction behavior. Data was collected using a telephone survey (n= 1, 849) of household decision makers in flood-prone areas. We show that insurance overall is positively associated with <b>private</b> <b>risk</b> reduction behavior. Warranties, premium discounts, and information provision with respect to risk reduction may be an explanation for this positive relationship in the case of structural measures. Public incentives for risk-reduction measures by means of financial and in-kind support, and particularly through the provision of information are also associated with enhancing risk reduction. In this study public compensation is not negatively associated with <b>private</b> <b>risk</b> reduction behavior. This does not disprove such a relationship, but the negative effect may be mitigated by factors related to respondent’s capacity to implement measures or social norms that were not included in the analysis. The data suggests that large-scale flood protection infrastructure creates a sense of security that is associated with a lower level of preparedness. Across the board there is ample room to improve both public and private policies to provide effective incentives for household level risk reduction...|$|R

40|$|The European Banking Union is a {{major step}} forward in fixing major {{deficiencies}} in the institutional framework of the Euro area. The absence of effective banking supervision and resolution powers at the European level promoted excessive private risk-taking in the up-run to the Euro crisis.

A properly designed Banking Union facilitates and improves <b>private</b> <b>risk</b> sharing, and it is thus a necessary institutional complement to a monetary union. Yet, the institutional framework of the Banking Union needs further strengthening in three regards.

40|$|Contingent {{wildfire}} {{insurance and}} fuel management cost-sharing programs {{are becoming more}} prevalent in western states. This paper develops a model to examine the incentive effects of these two mechanisms for private investment in wildfire risk mitigation. The model shows that contingent insurance contracts strengthen incentives for risk mitigation relative to pooled contracts and subsidies induce more risk mitigation effort by reducing margin private costs of mitigation. With pooled insurance contracts, individuals in low-risk areas subsidize the premiums of individuals living in high-risk areas, inducing too much development in high-risk areas. Subsidies can improve incentives for risk mitigation, but they also may induce excessive development in high-risk areas. Our model shows that because high-risk property owners have weak incentives to mitigate their own <b>private</b> <b>risk,</b> cost-sharing programs can be utterly ineffective at worst or extremely costly at best for inducing even second-best fuel management incentives. In contrast, contingent insurance contracts {{have the capacity to}} improve incentives for <b>private</b> <b>risk</b> reduction, and also improve the cost effectiveness of subsidy programs.

In addition, unlike in the expected utility model, the capital income tax increase does not stimulate risktaking when the reference level is the initial wealth or the gross after the tax return from investing the initial wealth into the risk-free asset. Furthermore, when investors set their reference level at the gross (pre-tax) return from investing the initial wealth into the riskfree asset, they increase not only risk-taking but also their <b>private</b> <b>risks</b> {{as measured by the}} standard deviation of their after-tax final wealth, which is not the case in the expected utility model...|$|E

In this paper we theoretically characterize and numerically compute equilibria in an economy with limited enforcement and a continuum of agents facing realistic income risk and tax systems with various degrees of risk reduction (progressivity). We find that the crowding-out effect of public insurance on private insurance in the limited enforcement model can be quantitatively important, as is the positive insurance effect of taxation in the Bewley model. ...|$|R
