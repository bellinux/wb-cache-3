Thus far, experiments involving diesel <b>PM</b> (<b>particulate</b> <b>matter)</b> oxidation by NO 2 are only practiced as regards the soot deposited on filters or plates. However, in aerosol state, depending on the surrounding temperature and the NO 2 concentration, the carbon nanoparticle removal rate is significantly different.

From the original equipment manufacturers view, the hardware cost will be increased substantially when compared to current silencer systems. From the vehicle owner’s point of view, the possibility of large running cost increases is not desired, and the system solution cost and its benefits must ultimately be acceptable.

A number of investigators have studied the {{shape of the}} particulate matter-mortality dose-response relation and concluded that the relation could be adequately described by a linear model. Some of these researchers examined the hypothesis of linearity by comparing Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) values obtained under linear, piece-wise linear, and spline alternative models. However, at the current time, the efficacy of the AIC in this context has not been assessed. The authors investigated AIC as a means of comparing competing dose-response models, using data from Cook County, Illinois, for the period 1987 – 2000.

Due to safety and practicability of such measurements, a distance is required for the transportation of the exhaust samples from the aircraft engine exhaust exit to particle measurement instruments.

The work in this paper investigated the particle penetration/loss along a 25 meters ARP proposed particle sample transfer line by measuring the particle emissions from an aircraft auxiliary power unit (APU) at idle and full power. Two SMPS instruments were used to simultaneously measure exhaust particle size distributions at the entrance and exit of the 25 m transfer line. A catalytic stripper was used to remove volatile particles so that non-volatile particles can be measured. The particle penetration factors for the 25 m transfer line were found to be 0. 6 ∼ 0. 7 in general, excluding particles smaller than 10 nm.
