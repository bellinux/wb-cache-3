40|$|A {{key driver}} of Australian sweetpotato {{productivity}} improvements and consumer demand has been industry adoption of disease-free planting material systems. On a farm isolated from main Australian sweetpotato areas, virus-free germplasm is annually multiplied, with subsequent 'pathogen-tested' (PT) sweetpotato roots shipped to commercial Australian sweetpotato growers. They in turn plant their PT roots into specially designated <b>plant</b> <b>beds,</b> commencing in late winter. From these beds, they cut sprouts {{as the basis}} for their commercial fields. Along with other intense agronomic practices, this system enables Australian producers to achieve worldRSQUOs highest commercial yields (per hectare) of premium sweetpotatoes. Their industry organisation, ASPG (Australian Sweetpotato Growers Inc.), has identified productivity of mother <b>plant</b> <b>beds</b> as a key driver of crop performance. Growers and scientists are currently collaborating to investigate issues such as catastrophic <b>plant</b> <b>beds</b> losses; optimisation of irrigation and nutrient addition; rapidity and uniformity of initial <b>plant</b> <b>bed</b> harvests; optimal <b>plant</b> <b>bed</b> harvest techniques; virus re-infection of plant beds; and practical longevity of <b>plant</b> <b>beds.</b> A survey of 50 sweetpotato growers in Queensland and New South Wales identified a substantial diversity in current <b>plant</b> <b>bed</b> systems, apparently influenced by growing district, scale of operation, time of planting, and machinery/labour availability. Growers identified key areas for <b>plant</b> <b>bed</b> research as: optimising the size and grading specifications of PT roots supplied for the plant beds; change in sprout density, vigour and performance through sequential cuttings of the plant bed; optimal height above ground level to cut sprouts to maximise commercial crop and <b>plant</b> <b>bed</b> performance; and use of structures and soil amendments in <b>plant</b> <b>bed</b> systems. Our ongoing multi-disciplinary research program integrates detailed agronomic experiments, grower adaptive learning sites, product quality and consumer research, to enhance industry capacity for inspired innovation and commercial, sustainable practice change...|$|R

50|$|The use {{of plastic}} mulch {{requires}} a unique application process to ensure proper {{placement of the}} plastic film. This application process begins with preparing the field the same way one would for a flat seed bed. The bed must be free of large soil clods and organic residue. A machine called a plastic layer or a bed shaper is pulled over the field creating a row of plastic mulch covering a <b>planting</b> <b>bed.</b> These beds can be a flat bed which simply means {{the surface of the}} plastic mulch is level with the inter-row soil surface. Machines that form raised beds create a plastic surface higher than the inter-row soil surface. The basic concept of the plastic bed shaper is a shaping box which creates the bed that is then covered by plastic via a roller and two coulters that cover the edges of the plastic film to hold the plastic the soil’s surface. These plastic layers also place the drip irrigation line under the plastic while the machine lays the plastic. It is somewhat important that the plastic is rather tight. This becomes important in the planting process.|$|E
40|$|Changes {{in plant}} and macroinvertebrate {{communities}} were found following replacement of extensive zones of floating-attached/submergent native vegetation within Fitzroy River backwaters {{by the major}} environmental weed Hymenachne amplexicaulis (Poaceae).

Plant biomass of Hymenachne <b>plant</b> <b>beds</b> was thirty-fold greater than Native <b>plant</b> <b>beds</b> whereas <b>plant</b> species diversity (richness) was significantly less.

40|$|A bioretention system {{consists}} of a soil bed planted with suitable non-invasive (preferably native) vegetation. Stormwater runoff entering the bioretention system is filtered through the soil <b>planting</b> <b>bed</b> before being either conveyed downstream by an underdrain system or infiltrated into the existing subsoil below the soil bed. Vegetation in the soil <b>planting</b> <b>bed</b> provides uptake of pollutants and runoff and helps maintain the pores and associated infiltration rates of the soil in the bed. A bioretention system can be configured as either a bioretention basin or a longer, narrower bioretention swale. In general, a bioretention basin has a flat bottom while a bioretention swale may have sloping bottom. Runoff storage depths above the soil bed surface are typically shallow. The TSS removal rate for bioretention systems is 80 or 90 percent, depending upon {{the thickness of the}} soil <b>planting</b> <b>bed</b> and the type of vegetation grown in the bed. Purpose Bioretention systems are used to remove a wide range of pollutants, such as suspended solids, nutrients, metals, hydrocarbons, and bacteria from stormwater runoff. They {{can also be used to}} reduce peak runoff rates and increase stormwater infiltration when designed as a multi-stage, multi-function facility. Conditions Where Practice Applies Bioretention systems can be used to filter the runoff from both residential and nonresidential developments. Concentrated inflow from a drainage pipe or swale must include adequate erosion protection and energy dissipation measures. Bioretention systems are most effective when they receive runoff as close to its source as possible. They can vary in size and can receive and treat runoff from a variety of drainage areas within a land development site. They can be installed in lawns, median strips, parking lot islands, unused lot areas, and certain easements. They are intended to receive and filter storm runoff from both impervious areas and lawns. A bioretention system must not be placed into operation until the contributing drainage area is completely stabilized. Therefore, system construction must either be delayed or upstream runoff diverte...|$|E
