40|$|Objectives: With rapidly {{increasing}} numbers <b>of</b> <b>publications,</b> <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> study quality, reporting quality, and classification of studies {{according to their}} level of evidence or developmental stage have become key issues in weighing the relevance of new information reported. Diagnostic marker studies are often criticized for yielding highly discrepant and even controversial results. Much of this discrepancy {{has been attributed to}} differences in study quality. So far, numerous tools for measuring study quality have been developed, but few of them have been used for systematic reviews and meta-analysis. This is owing to the fact that most tools are complicated and time consuming, suffer from poor reproducibility, and do not permit quantitative scoring. Methods: The International Bladder Cancer Network (IBCN) has adopted this problem and has systematically identified the more commonly used tools developed since 2000. Results: In this review, those tools addressing study quality (Quality <b>Assessment</b> <b>of</b> Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale), reporting quality (Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy), and developmental stage (IBCN phases) of studies on diagnostic markers in bladder cancer are introduced and critically analyzed. Based upon this, the IBCN has launched an initiative to assess and validate existing tools with emphasis on diagnostic bladder cancer studies. Conclusions: The development of simple and reproducible tools for quality <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> diagnostic marker studies permitting quantitative scoring is suggested...|$|R

30|$|Based on {{reference}} ground motions, {{the site}} factors in mountain regions, including the Longitudinal Valley, {{are in the}} ranges 0.9 to 1.5 for PGA and 0.8 to 1.3 for PGV. The amplification factors expectably increase to about 2.0 ∼ 3.5 for PGA, and 1.3 ∼ 2.6 for PGV, at soil sites located in the Taipei area, the Ilan plain, and western coastal regions having large populations. Using these factors for modifying the predictions, a relatively smaller misfit range from 0.30 to 0.50 can be determined {{for most of the}} 54 analyzed shallow earthquakes. These results basically indicate that a preliminary isoseismal map for rapid reporting could be produced by the procedures implemented in this study. However, a large misfit, having an obvious systematic deviation of ground motion, can be shown in the predictions for some of the events. The possible reason causing such a type of residual pattern might be attributed to the stress drop of a seismic source which could be very different from the value of 30 bar used in this model. It appears to be difficult to determine the stress drop in a short time for simulating a better prediction of ground motion for the purpose <b>of</b> the rapid <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> ground shaking hazards.|$|R
40|$|This {{systematic}} review aims to identify reviews of fetal fibronectin and transvaginal cervical length for predicting preterm birth, {{so that these}} could be appraised and the findings from good quality reviews highlighted. Reviews, rather than individual studies, are the basis for this {{systematic review}} because of the proliferation of reviews {{and the benefits of}} a single, consistent appraisal and <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> evidence from these reviews, rather than further attempts to find and appraise the many individual studies in the literature. Potentially eligible reviews were sought primarily through searches of the electronic databases MEDLINE (1966 - 2005), EMBASE (1980 - 2005), CINHAL (1982 - 2005), Science Citation Index (1970 - 2005) and The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2005). Our systematic review consists of a description of the two factors that might be predictive of preterm birth and for which at least one relevant review was found. The scope and quality of the identified review(s) are described, and their conclusions and the strength of these conclusions discussed. Ten reviews were identified, of which seven were included in this systematic review of reviews. The quality of each review is assessed within the following domains; the extent of searching undertaken, description of study selection and inclusion criteria, comparability <b>of</b> included studies, <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>publication</b> bias, <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> heterogeneity and conduct of sensitivity analyses.

40|$|Human {{biomonitoring}} (HBM) data is a {{very useful}} metric for assessing human 2 ̆ 7 s exposures to chemicals in commerce. To assess the potential health risks associated {{with the presence of}} chemicals in blood, urine or other biological matrix requires HBM assessment values. While HBM assessment values based on human exposure-response data remain the most highly valuable and interpretable assessment values, enough data exists for such values for very few chemicals. As a consequence, efforts have been undertaken to derive HBM assessment values in which external dose based guidance values such as tolerable daily intakes have been translated into equivalent biomonitoring levels. The development of HBM values by the German HBM Commission and Biomonitoring Equivalents by Summit Toxicology has resulted in conceptually similar assessment values. The review of the development of these values provided here demonstrates examples and approaches {{that can be used to}} broaden the range of chemicals for which such assessment values can be derived.

The UNEP has been hindered by its title as a Programme as opposed to a Specialized agency like the WTO or WHO, in addition to a lack of voluntary funding, and a location removed from the centers of political power, in Nairobi, Kenya.

40|$|This {{small-scale}} study {{into the}} summative assessment practices in ICT {{of schools in}} the North West of England identifies a lack of consistency in teacher assessment {{at the end of}} KS 3. Central to the research is a consideration of what is meant by ICT capability. This phrase is important in this research because it is the term used in Government policy documents to indicate what schools are to assess in ICT at the end of KS 3. Hence, if ICT assessment is to be consistent, there should be a shared understanding of this term. The research explores the lack of common understanding of the term in literature and then goes on to illustrate how this lack of understanding is mirrored in schools. This results in inconsistency of practice in assessing ICT in schools. This inconsistency of practice is explored through in-depth interviews with a number of Heads of Department from a range of Secondary Schools in the North West of England. Alongside the main consideration <b>of</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> ICT, the research also explores recent trends in assessment practices in English schools. The problematic nature <b>of</b> summative <b>assessment</b> is discussed as indicated by the attempts in the English National Curriculum to link assessment to observable and measurable criteria and how this leads to more and more trivialisation of what is being assessed. Assessment ‘backwash’ is considered where the outcomes <b>of</b> summative <b>assessment</b> are used in ways for which they were not originally intended; for example where summative assessment results such as those generated at the end of KS 3 are used to measure the overall ‘quality’ of a school in comparison with other schools. Brief consideration is given to the recent focus on formative assessment techniques, as typified by the 2008 UK Government <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> an <b>Assessment</b> for Learning Strategy, although only in order to illustrate emerging assessment practices in schools.

Thus not only are IFCs to be judged on the accuracy of their forecasts but the potentially contradictory measure of IFC’s capacity and record for initiating necessary changes.
