5|$|While the long-toed {{salamander}} {{is classified as}} least concern by the IUCN, many forms of land development negatively affect the salamander's habitat and have <b>put</b> <b>new</b> perspectives and priorities into its conservation biology. Conservation priorities focus at the population level of diversity, which is declining at rates ten times that of species extinction. Population level diversity is what provides ecosystem services, such as the keystone role that salamanders play in the soil ecosystems, including the nutrient cycling that supports wetland and forested ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} season series, the Mets held onto first place until September 16, when a September surge moved the Phillies into first place. On September 19, however, the Phillies {{lost to the}} Florida Marlins while the Mets beat the Atlanta Braves to <b>put</b> <b>New</b> York back into the {{division}} lead. The results were reversed the following night, and the Phillies regained the top spot, where they would ultimately finish. The Phillies won the National League East on September 27, while the Mets were eliminated from postseason contention {{the next day with}} a 4–2 loss to the Florida Marlins in the final game at Shea Stadium. The Milwaukee Brewers defeated the Chicago Cubs that day to clinch the National League wild card. This marked {{the second year in a}} row the Mets were eliminated from the playoffs on the last regular-season game. It also marked the first time in baseball history that a team had lost the last game of the season to miss the playoffs after holding a three-game lead in two consecutive seasons. After victories over the Brewers and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the postseason, the Phillies went on to win the World Series over the Tampa Bay Rays.|$|E
5|$|As the hosts, England {{reached the}} final of the 1991 tournament at Twickenham, where they faced Australia. Fly-half Michael Lynagh opened the scoring for Australia with a penalty in the 27th minute. They {{extended}} their lead before half-time when prop Tony Daly scored a try, which was converted by Lynagh. England scored two penalties in the second half, courtesy of full-back Jonathan Webb, but a further penalty by Lynagh sealed Australia's victory at 12–6. The tournament hosts reached the final again in 1995, as South Africa faced New Zealand in Johannesburg. Fly-half Andrew Mehrtens opened the scoring for New Zealand in the 6th minute after scoring a penalty. His opposite number, Joel Stransky, levelled the score five minutes later. The pair swapped successful penalty attempts before Stransky gave South Africa a 9–6 lead with a 32nd-minute drop goal just before half-time. New Zealand equalized in the 55th minute with a drop goal by Mehrtens, and as no further points were scored, the final went into extra time for the first time. Mehrtens converted a penalty to <b>put</b> <b>New</b> Zealand back the lead, but Stransky replied minutes later. With seven minutes to the end of extra time, Stransky scored a drop goal to secure a 15–12 victory for South Africa. Nelson Mandela, the South African President, wearing a Springboks jersey, presented the Webb Ellis Cup to South Africa captain François Pienaar.|$|E

There were good scores from Chris Cairns, Brendon McCullum and Daniel Vettori too, and New Zealand put the new super sub rule to its full use and placed all-rounder Andre Adams at number 11 in the batting order.

As the contractors renovated each apartment, they kept the original hardware, including the glass doorknobs and brass hinges, as well as the kitchen cabinets and apartment doors, and they sanded and stained the original wood floors. To bring the building up to current standards, they replaced the wiring and plumbing, and installed a sprinkler system and central air-conditioning in the apartments and public areas. The central air-conditioning replaced the huge basement fans, which had been in use since 1931, as well as window units.
