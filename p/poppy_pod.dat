25|$|Morphine was {{the most}} {{commonly}} abused narcotic analgesic in the world until heroin was synthesized and came into use. In general, until the synthesis of dihydromorphine (ca. 1900), the dihydromorphinone class of opioids (1920s), and oxycodone (1916) and similar drugs, {{there were no other}} drugs in the same efficacy range as opium, morphine, and heroin, with synthetics still several years away (pethidine was invented in Germany in 1937) and opioid agonists among the semi-synthetics were analogues and derivatives of codeine such as dihydrocodeine (Paracodin), ethylmorphine (Dionine), and benzylmorphine (Peronine). Even today, morphine is the most sought after prescription narcotic by heroin addicts when heroin is scarce, all other things being equal; local conditions and user preference may cause hydromorphone, oxymorphone, high-dose oxycodone, or methadone as well as dextromoramide in specific instances such as 1970s Australia, to top that particular list. The stop-gap drugs used by the largest absolute number of heroin addicts is probably codeine, with significant use also of dihydrocodeine, poppy straw derivatives like <b>poppy</b> <b>pod</b> and poppy seed tea, propoxyphene, and tramadol.|$|E

50|$|According to Carl A. P. Ruck and Danny Staples, the {{chambered}} pomegranate is also {{a surrogate}} for the poppy's narcotic capsule, with its comparable shape and chambered interior. On a Mycenaean seal illustrated in Joseph Campbell's Occidental Mythology (1964), figure 19, the seated Goddess of the double-headed axe (the labrys) offers three <b>poppy</b> <b>pods</b> {{in her right hand}} and supports her breast with her left. She embodies both aspects of the dual goddess, life-giving and death-dealing at once.|$|R
25|$|Seed {{capsules}} can be {{dried and}} used for decorations, but they also contain morphine, codeine, and other alkaloids. These pods can be boiled in water to produce a bitter tea that induces a long-lasting intoxication (See Poppy tea). If allowed to mature, <b>poppy</b> <b>pods</b> (<b>poppy</b> straw) can be crushed and used to produce lower quantities of morphinans. In poppies subjected to mutagenesis and selection on a mass scale, researchers {{have been able to}} use poppy straw to obtain large quantities of oripavine, a precursor to opioids and antagonists such as naltrexone. Although millennia older, the production of poppy head decoctions {{can be seen as a}} quick and dirty variant of the Kábáy poppy straw process, which since its publication in 1930 has become the major method of obtaining licit opium alkaloids worldwide, as discussed under the Wikipedia Morphine article.|$|R
50|$|An opioid is a {{chemical}} substance {{that has a}} morphine-like action in the body. Most opioids are not legal for over the counter purchase; However, some products that are legal (<b>poppy</b> seeds, <b>poppy</b> <b>pods,</b> and <b>poppy</b> plant material) contain morphine, codeine, and other analgesic opiates. Many of these products may be purchased legally but {{it is illegal to}} use them for anything other than cooking and decorative purposes. Codeine can be purchased over the counter in some jurisdictions, but it's usually mixed with paracetamol to discourage recreational use. The paracetamol, however, can be removed fairly easily by manipulation of the different solubility of paracetamol and codeine in cold water.|$|R

2500|$|Opium {{was used}} with poison hemlock {{to put people}} quickly and painlessly to death, {{but it was also}} used in medicine. The Ebers Papyrus, [...] BCE, {{describes}} a way to [...] "stop a crying child" [...] using grains of the poppy plant strained to a pulp. Spongia somnifera, sponges soaked in opium, were used during surgery. The Egyptians cultivated opium thebaicum in famous poppy fields around 1300 BCE. Opium was traded from Egypt by the Phoenicians and Minoans to destinations around the Mediterranean Sea, including Greece, Carthage, and Europe. By 1100 BCE, opium was cultivated on Cyprus, where surgical-quality knives were used to score the <b>poppy</b> <b>pods,</b> and opium was cultivated, traded, and smoked. Opium was also mentioned after the Persian conquest of Assyria and Babylonian lands in the 6th century BCE.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the major}} themes present through Kevin Gray’s work include drug production, social {{alienation}} {{and the destruction of}} nature. The poppy field paintings, while at first glance seem to be innocent depictions of flower meadows, actually highlight underlying themes of danger and threat through the cut <b>poppy</b> seed <b>pods,</b> key to the production of opium and heroin.|$|R
5000|$|Once {{known as}} the [...] "common garden poppy", live plants and seeds of the opium poppy are widely sold by seed {{companies}} and nurseries {{in most of the}} western world, including the United States. Poppies are sought after by gardeners for the vivid coloration of the blooms, the hardiness and reliability of the poppy plants, the exotic chocolate-vegetal fragrance note of some cultivars, and the ease of growing the plants from purchased flats of seedlings or by direct sowing of the seed. <b>Poppy</b> seed <b>pods</b> are also sold for dried flower arrangements.|$|R
5000|$|The use of {{the term}} kompot or compote refers euphemistically to kompot, a {{traditional}} compote-like dessert popular in Central and Eastern European countries made of stewed fruit, spices, and sugar. The so-called kompot method of making a crude opiate [...] "cocktail" [...] intended for injection involves stewing the pods of the opium poppy in nearly boiling water and an acid, and using the strained liquid (essentially like kompot is produced from the raw ingredients). However, in 1976 two Polish students from Gdańsk discovered a simple way of making it by extracting opiate alkaloids from poppy straw by using ion exchange resin, acetone, ammonia water and a few other chemicals used in the last step of production. In this method, opium <b>poppy</b> <b>pods</b> and stems are boiled in water for a few hours without adding acid, and then filtered. Strongly acidic ion exchange resin is then added. The resin is filtered and the opiates are recovered with the addition of ammonia water. The resulting liquid is evaporated using a chemical condenser, then when dry (it is then called glazura - glaze) it is acetylated using acetic anhydride in an anhydrous environment of a non-polar solvent, for example toluene, diethyl ether, chloroform, or most commonly acetone. After acetylation, the solvent is evaporated to remove the acetic anhydride, and finally water is added. The amount of water added depends on the amount of plant material used {{in the beginning of the}} process, most often 30 milliliters per kilogram of dry plant material. Although the drug is primarily intended for intravenous injection, kompot extraction as described here produces an end product containing residual plant matter, waste chemicals, impure water, and other contaminants, making this dangerous substance to inject since such impurities can lead to abscesses or anaphylactic shock.|$|R
40|$|Over half {{a century}} ago Robert Merrillees raised a {{brilliant}} hypothesis according to which Late Cypriot Base Ring juglets, supposedly shaped like inverted <b>poppy</b> seed <b>pod</b> to advertise their contents, traded opium over the Eastern Mediterranean. This most appealing idea was enthusiastically embraced by students of the Ancient Near East, in spite of the meager scientific evidence supporting it. In order to provide new insights to this intriguing issue four Base Ring I juglets recently found in a secured Late Bronze IIA (14 th century BCE) context at Tel Beth-Shemesh, Israel, were submitted for residue analysis at the University of New York at Albany. No traces of opium were found in these juglets. Analysis of 14 additional Base Ring juglets and jugs from Cyprus yielded similar results. Rather, the juglets from Beth-Shemesh contained aromatic oils which could be used externally or consumed for their medicinal benefits. It seems that the one and only positive case as yet of a Base Ring juglet containing opium (from an unprovenanced origin, probably reused) is an exception that proves the rule – Base Ring juglets mainly carried non-narcotic substances...|$|R
50|$|Paine's vitrines and botanical works often feature {{replicas of}} plants that have been {{discovered}} as extremely poisonous or {{have been used by}} humans for experimental hallucinogenic or drug experiences. The living plants are cast and subsequently rendered in thermoset polymers, paint, lacquer, and epoxy, among other materials. Crop, 1997-98, shows a field of <b>poppies,</b> with ripened <b>pods</b> exposing the evidence of raw opium being readied for harvest. The piece embodies the shifting views of the beauty of a field of wild flowers and the grave potential of drug addiction. Amanita Muscaria Field, 2000, shows a field of psychoactive mushrooms that appear as if they are sprouting from the gallery floor. This field might present multiple readings: are these works a hallucinogenic vision on their own or do they represent the plant life that offers the possibility of arriving at that vision? Another related series of works is that of the Dead Amanita vitrines, lifelike mushrooms seem to be decaying under glass. The genus Amanita is a group of poisonous and psychoactive mushrooms that has some species that are among the deadliest if ingested by humans.|$|R
