40|$|Inorganic {{materials}} (such as silica and alumina) is {{a material}} {{that is very important}} and the most desirable in the field of membrane technology. This is due to the physical characteristics and permeation properties owned by the two materials is much better when compared to other polymerbased material. Alumina, for example, this material mostly can be found in clay, and the price is much cheaper as well as easy to find if compared to silica material. The use of <b>peat</b> <b>clay</b> as raw material to produce alumina as membranes support from natural materials would save production costs. This material is also easy to find in South Kalimantan especially around the wetland areas. The aim {{of this study is to}} characterize the <b>peat</b> <b>clay</b> as raw material to fabricate membranes module (membranes support). The method is by drying the clay material in uniform particle size (monosize). The raw material powder is then mixed with the organic additives. This organic content provide the hydrophilicity and prorosity agent. Furthermore, it then was calcined and characterized to determine the functional group of the material weather it is more hydrophilicity and porosity. The result shows that the addition of H 2 O and starch content of functional groups affect the content of the Si-O-Si and Si-O-Al groups on clay material. The content of Si-O-Si and Si-O-Al decreases if content of H 2 O and starch is higher. It is shown that the streching the Si-OH groups that are more hydrophilic transform into Si-O-Si and Si-O-Al groups that are more hydrophobic. Therefore, the calcined material will be more hydrophobic and more porous...|$|E

The bioassays {{can be used}} in unpolluted, contaminated and cleaned-up soils. In former research soils cleaned-up by extraction appeared to have lost structure and nutrients so that earthworms died and plants didn't grow. A standard additive was developed which enables the performance of the bioassays in both contaminated and cleaned-up soils without, influencing the bioavailability of the metals. Therefore several additives (<b>peat,</b> <b>clay,</b> sand, perlite, cow-dung and nutrient solution) in varying quantities were tested in some contaminated and cleaned-up soils. The influence of the additives on the survival of worms and the growth of radish and lettuce were established. The bioassays lasted 4 weeks. A suited standard additive for the bioassay using earthworms appeared to be: 8 vol% perlite; 1 g cow-dung/ worm; nutrient solution. The developed standard additive for the bioassays using radish or lettuce consists of: 8 vol% perlite; nutrient solution. The standard additives were tested in contaminated and cleaned-up soils and appeared to enable survival of the earthworms and proper growth of radish and lettuce.

40|$|While {{bioremediation}} {{of total}} petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) is in general a robust technique, heterogeneity {{in terms of}} contaminant and environmental characteristics can impact the extent of biodegradation. The current study investigates the implications of different soil matrix types (anthropogenic fill layer, <b>peat,</b> <b>clay,</b> and sand) and bioavailability on bioremediation of an aged diesel contamination from a heterogeneous site. In addition to an uncontaminated sample for each soil type, samples representing two levels of contamination (high and low) were also used; initial TPH concentrations varied between 1. 6 and 26. 6 g TPH/kg and bioavailability between 36 and 100 %. While significant biodegradation occurred during 100 days of incubation under biostimulating conditions (64. 4 - 100 % remediation efficiency), low bioavailability restricted full biodegradation, yielding a residual TPH concentration. Respiration levels, {{as well as the}} abundance of alkB, encoding mono-oxygenases pivotal for hydrocarbon metabolism, were positively correlated with TPH degradation, demonstrating their usefulness as a proxy for hydrocarbon biodegradation. However, absolute respiration and alkB presence were dependent on soil matrix type, indicating the sensitivity of results to initial environmental conditions.

One of the neglected taxa is Z. macrantha Desv., an Australian native species further divided into two subspecies. The coarser Z. macrantha subsp. macrantha occurs on sand dunes, headlands and tidal areas along eastern and southeastern coasts from about 23 to 38 °S latitude. The shorter, denser-growing Z. macrantha subsp. walshii M. E.

GPR probing was carried out along eight parallel traverses in the E–W direction using the GSSI SIR- 3000 200  MHz monostatic antenna. Geotechnical investigations involving sieve analysis, Atterberg limits, moisture content, organic content and consolidation test were carried out for soil classification and competence test. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were conducted to determine clay mineralogy of the peaty soil. The GPR data were processed using Radpro software. Four lithological layers consisting the topsoil (sand), <b>peat,</b> <b>clay</b> and sandy clay were delineated from the processed GPR data. Peat occurred at shallow depth to depths deeper than the foundation depth of the engineering structure investigated. The geotechnical results revealed that the peat has 125 – 167  % moisture content, high liquid limit and plastic index values of 109 – 174  % and 60 – 100  % respectively and organic content of 5.12  %. The sieve analysis showed that the peaty soil is fine grained having up to 98  % passing at 0.004  mm sieve opening exhibiting high compressibility and low consolidation coefficients. This peat was classified as organic clay with peat using the unified soil classification system. The XRD analyses showed the dominance of kaolinite, illite and quartz minerals in the peaty soil.

40|$|The {{integrated}} Coastal Zone and Shelf Sea Research (INTERCOAST) organization, {{a cooperative}} German and New Zealand multidisciplinary research program, concentrates on scientific issues {{in social and}} natural science disciplines in the both countries. INTERCOAST 4 (IC 4) Ph. D. program tackled geotechnically problematic soft soils such as <b>peat,</b> <b>clay</b> and clayey silts which have posed considerable challenges to geotechnical engineers {{in all parts of}} the world during design and construction process. In Germany, peat is one of the prevailing groups of soil which is present in both off-shore and on-shore areas and exhibit properties such as high compressibility and low shear strength; these properties may cause complications such as differential settlement or failure in structures built on such soils. Removal or stabilization are the most important methods used to overcome geotechnical problems related to peat soilsâ engineering characteristics. In New Zealand, many off-shore and on-shore areas of the North Island are covered by volcanic ash, and weathering of this material has resulted in formation of clay minerals. Dredging of volcanic ash layers often causes major turbidity in the water column and poses risks to wildlife and humans. Due to very low effective shear strength and high sensitivity of volcanic ash, these sediments are not considered to be appropriate for off-shore construction and installation purposes. On-shore weathered volcanic ash having low permeability acts as a barrier to fluid flow, for example infiltration of rainfall, and prevents pore pressure from dissipating. This special characteristic may lead to failure of slopes with volcanic ash materials because increases in pore pressure lowers the effective normal (vertical) stress, and therefore shear strength. The aim of this dissertation is to utilize in-situ and laboratory measurements in order to (i) present soil mechanical intervention for stabilization of peat using cost-effective and environmentally-friendly stabilization method and focus on a comparison between mechanical characteristics of undisturbed and stabilized peat, (ii) investigate geological setting, lithology and depositional history of off-shore sub-seafloor volcanic soils and determine geotechnical properties of near-surface sediments and (iii) look into the role of volcanic soils in occurrence of on-shore landslides...|$|E
