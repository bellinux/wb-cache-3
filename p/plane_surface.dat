40|$|For {{the purpose}} of solving all the {{problems}} involved, an investigation was made with flat, rectangular <b>planing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The investigation of a flat, rectangular <b>planing</b> <b>surface,</b> which {{can be considered as}} the portion of a flat float bottom lying in front of the step, has the advantage that the frictional resistance can be determined directly from the test results.

25|$|Gutenberg {{adopted the}} basic design, thereby mechanizing the {{printing}} process. Printing, however, put a demand {{on the machine}} quite different from pressing. Gutenberg adapted the construction so that the pressing power exerted by the platen on the paper was now applied both evenly and with the required sudden elasticity. To speed up the printing process, he introduced a movable undertable with a <b>plane</b> <b>surface</b> on which the sheets could be swiftly changed.|$|E
25|$|Laser {{microphones}} {{are often}} portrayed in movies as spy gadgets, {{because they can}} be used to pick up sound at a distance from the microphone equipment. A laser beam is aimed at the surface of a window or other <b>plane</b> <b>surface</b> that is affected by sound. The vibrations of this surface change the angle at which the beam is reflected, and the motion of the laser spot from the returning beam is detected and converted to an audio signal.|$|E
500|$|On 29 September 1638, Horrocks {{wrote to}} Crabtree about a likely {{forthcoming}} transit of Mercury on 21 October 1638 (Old Style) which Kepler had not predicted. He {{explained that he}} intended to construct what would later be called a helioscope by attaching his telescope to an [...] "oblong stick, carrying a <b>plane</b> <b>surface</b> at right angles to itself on which to receive the Sun’s image", and that he would draw a circle with numerical markings on a sheet of paper on which to project the image of the Sun. In the event, no such transit took place as Mercury passed over the Sun well outside the limit for a transit, but the exercise proved to be an important dry-run for the later observation of the transit of Venus.|$|E

2500|$|In Two Nudes, Metzinger {{has treated}} the human body, trees and rocks {{in exactly the}} same manner. They are {{differentiated}} only by size, or by emphasising planes, from which the Russian term, plos'kost, <b>plane</b> <b>surface,</b> comes directly from the French, surface plane (in distinction to the curved plane). Metzinger sees everything as cubic multiples with which he [...] "builds", as it were, stacking them, interlocking them, and bonding them together. Thus he creates a total environment where figures and setting make up a pictorial unit. [...] Although not particularly apparent due to the haziness of the contemporary photograph of Metzinger’s Two Nudes, such a linear framework was the fundamental ordering principle of his painting and it can be seen clearly in his 1911 canvas, Tea Time / Le Goûter.|$|E
60|$|The {{choice of}} descent was equally circumscribed, an {{accurately}} <b>plane</b> <b>surface</b> being needed for safe grounding. Apart from the destruction {{that would have}} been caused by the descent of this great expanse of sail and metal, and the impossibility of its rising again, the concussion of an irregular surface, a tree-set hillside, for instance, or an embankment, would be sufficient to pierce or damage the framework, to smash the ribs of the body, and perhaps kill those aboard.|$|E
60|$|Another {{example of}} an {{infinite}} continuum is the plane. On a <b>plane</b> <b>surface</b> we may lay squares of cardboard so that each side of any square has the side of another square adjacent to it. The construction is never finished; we can always go on laying squares--if their laws of disposition correspond to those of plane figures of Euclidean geometry. The plane is therefore infinite {{in relation to the}} cardboard squares. Accordingly we say that the plane is an infinite continuum of two dimensions, and space an infinite continuum of three dimensions. What is here meant by the number of dimensions, I think I may assume to be known.|$|E

40|$|A new {{numerical}} approach {{based on}} the Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) for {{the solution of the}} hydrodynamic performances of cambered hulls in steady planing is formulated and validated. Due to its fully 3 D formulation, the method can be applied to both cambered and un-cambered dihedral <b>planing</b> <b>surfaces</b> of any shape without any further approximation. The exact three-dimensional wetted surface of the hull is where the body boundary condition is fulfilled. The sprays region detaching both in front of the stagnation root line and from the wet portion of the chine are modeled in the numerical scheme by means of additional vortex lattice regions. The dynamic boundary condition at the stern of the hull is non-linear with respect to the perturbation potential. Results show the dynamic pressure consistently accounts for the 3 D features of the flow {{especially in the case of}} cambered <b>planing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The numerical method is verified by a systematic analysis against semi-empirical methods and it is finally validated with experimental results on prismatic as well as cambered dihedral <b>planing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Excellent correlations are found for both types of <b>planing</b> <b>surfaces</b> that range in the same confidence interval of higher fidelity numerical models, such as RANSE solvers...|$|R

But as the construction progresses it becomes more and more patent that the disposition of the discs in the manner indicated, without interruption, is not possible, as it should be possible by Euclidean geometry of the the <b>plane</b> <b>surface.</b> In this way creatures which cannot leave the spherical surface, and cannot even peep out from the spherical surface into three-dimensional space, might discover, merely by experimenting with discs, that their two-dimensional [...] "space" [...] is not Euclidean, but spherical space.|$|E

60|$|Observations again {{indicative}} of the radiation from grass, whether dewed or dry, are not strictly comparable; {{not only does the}} power of radiation vary with the species, but much more with the luxuriance and length of the blades, with the situation, whether on a <b>plane</b> <b>surface</b> or raised, and with the subjacent soil. Of the great effect of the soil I had frequent instances; similar tufts of the same species of grass radiating more powerfully on the dry sandy bed of the Soane, than on the alluvium on its banks; the exposure being equal in both instances. Experiments for the surface-temperature of the soil itself, are least satisfactory of any:--adjoining localities being no less affected by the nature, than by the state of disintegration of the surface, and by the amount of vegetation in proximity to the instrument.|$|E

60|$|This {{consists}} of three <b>plane</b> <b>surfaces</b> perpendicular {{to each other and}} rigidly attached to a rigid body. Referred to a system of co-ordinates, the scene of any event will be determined (for the main part) by the specification of the lengths of the three perpendiculars or co-ordinates (x, y, z) which can be dropped from the scene of the event to those three <b>plane</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The lengths of these three perpendiculars can be determined by a series of manipulations with rigid measuring-rods performed according to the rules and methods laid down by Euclidean geometry.|$|R
50|$|On {{undisturbed}} submerged bodies, pressure acts along all {{surfaces of}} a body in a liquid, causing equal perpendicular forces in the body to act against {{the pressure of the}} liquid.

6000|$|... 165. Now, {{these are}} the first terms of all well-constructed bas-relief. The mass you have to treat {{consists}} {{of a piece of}} stone which, however you afterwards carve it, can but, at its most projecting point, reach the level of the external <b>plane</b> <b>surface</b> out of which it was mapped, and defined by a depression round it; that depression being at first a mere trench, then a moat of a certain width, of which the outer sloping bank is in contact, as a limiting geometrical line, with the laterally salient portions of sculpture. This, I repeat, is the primal construction of good bas-relief, implying, first, perfect protection to its surface from any transverse blow, and a geometrically limited space to be occupied by the design, into which it shall pleasantly (and as you shall ultimately see, ingeniously,) contract itself: implying, secondly, a determined depth of projection, which it shall rarely reach, and never exceed: and implying, finally, the production of the whole piece with the least possible labor of chisel and loss of stone.|$|E
60|$|Underneath {{these two}} are Athena and Hermes, in the types {{attained}} {{about the time of}} Phidias; but, of course, rudely drawn on the vase, and still more rudely in this print from Le Normant and De Witte. For it is impossible (as you will soon find if you try for yourself) to give on a <b>plane</b> <b>surface</b> the grace of figures drawn on one of solid curvature, and adapted to all its curves: and among other minor differences, Athena's lance is in the original nearly twice as tall as herself, and has to be cut short to come into the print at all. Still, there is enough here to show you what I want you to see--the repose, and entirely realised personality, of the deities as conceived in the Phidian period. The relation of the two deities is, I believe, the same as in the painting above, though probably there is another added of more definite kind. But the physical meaning still remains--Athena unhelmeted, as the gentle morning wind, commanding the cloud Hermes to slow flight. His petasus is slung at his back, meaning that the clouds are not yet opened or expanded in the sky.|$|E
