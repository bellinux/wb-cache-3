5|$|Shulgin's {{professional}} activities {{continued to}} lean {{in the direction}} of <b>psychopharmacology,</b> furthered by his personal experiences with psychedelics. But during this period he was unable to do much independent research. His opportunity for further research came in 1961 after his development of Zectran, the first biodegradable pesticide, a highly profitable product. In his book PIHKAL, Shulgin limits his pesticide days at Dow Chemical to one sentence in 978 pages. Dow Chemical Company, in return for Zectran's valuable patent, gave Shulgin great freedom. During this time, he created and patented drugs when Dow asked, and published findings on other drugs in journals such as Nature and the Journal of Organic Chemistry. Eventually, Dow Chemical requested that he no longer use their name on his publications.|$|E

25|$|Biological {{psychiatry}} or biopsychiatry is {{an approach}} to psychiatry that aims to understand mental disorder {{in terms of the}} biological function of the nervous system. It is interdisciplinary in its approach and draws on sciences such as neuroscience, <b>psychopharmacology,</b> biochemistry, genetics, epigenetics and physiology to investigate the biological bases of behavior and psychopathology. Biopsychiatry is that branch / speciality of medicine which deals with the study of biological function of the nervous system in mental disorders.|$|E
25|$|Biological {{psychiatry}} is {{a branch}} of psychiatry where the focus is chiefly on researching and understanding the biological basis of major mental disorders such as unipolar and bipolar affective (mood) disorders, schizophrenia and organic mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. This knowledge has been gained using imaging techniques, <b>psychopharmacology,</b> neuroimmunochemistry and so on.

25|$|Psychiatric {{research}} is, by {{its very}} nature, interdisciplinary; combining social, biological and psychological perspectives in attempt {{to understand the nature}} and treatment of mental disorders. Clinical and research psychiatrists study basic and clinical psychiatric topics at research institutions and publish articles in journals. Under the supervision of institutional review boards, psychiatric clinical researchers look at topics such as neuroimaging, genetics, and <b>psychopharmacology</b> in order to enhance diagnostic validity and reliability, to discover new treatment methods, and to classify new mental disorders.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} couple of decades, there has been a growing {{movement}} to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of cultural, gender, spiritual, and sexual-orientation issues. Clinical psychologists are beginning to look at the various strengths and weaknesses of each orientation while also working with related fields, such as neuroscience, behavioral genetics, evolutionary biology, and <b>psychopharmacology.</b> The result is a growing practice of eclecticism, with psychologists learning various systems and the most efficacious methods of therapy with the intent to provide the best solution for any given problem.|$|E
25|$|By the 1970s, {{however, the}} psychoanalytic {{school of thought}} became marginalized within the field. Biological {{psychiatry}} reemerged during this time. <b>Psychopharmacology</b> became {{an integral part of}} psychiatry starting with Otto Loewi's discovery of the neuromodulatory properties of acetylcholine; thus identifying it as the first-known neurotransmitter. Neuroimaging was first utilized as a tool for psychiatry in the 1980s. The discovery of chlorpromazine's effectiveness in treating schizophrenia in 1952 revolutionized treatment of the disorder, as did lithium carbonate's ability to stabilize mood highs and lows in bipolar disorder in 1948. Psychotherapy was still utilized, but as a treatment for psychosocial issues.|$|E

The U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality concludes that olanzapine is not different from haloperidol in the treatment of positive symptoms and general psychopathology, or in overall assessment, but that it is superior for the treatment of negative and depressive symptoms. When trials enrolling only treatment-resistant patients were excluded from the analysis, olanzapine was superior for overall assessment.|$|E

2500|$|Increasingly, psychiatrists are {{limiting}} their practices to <b>psychopharmacology</b> (prescribing medications), {{as opposed to}} previous practice in which a psychiatrist would provide traditional 50-minute psychotherapy sessions, of which <b>psychopharmacology</b> would be a part, {{but most of the}} consultation sessions consisted of [...] "talk therapy." [...] This shift began in the early 1980s and accelerated in the 1990s and 2000s. A major reason for this change was the advent of managed care insurance plans, which began to limit reimbursement for psychotherapy sessions provided by psychiatrists. The underlying assumption was that <b>psychopharmacology</b> was at least as effective as psychotherapy, and it could be delivered more efficiently because less time is required for the appointment. For example, most psychiatrists schedule three or four follow-up appointments per hour, as opposed to seeing one patient per hour in the traditional psychotherapy model. Because of this shift in practice patterns, psychiatrists often refer patients whom they think would benefit from psychotherapy to other mental health professionals, e.g., clinical social workers and psychologists.|$|E

2500|$|The TCAs were {{developed}} amid the [...] "explosive birth" [...] of <b>psychopharmacology</b> {{in the early}} 1950s.

Its psychiatric effects were first noticed {{at a hospital in}} Paris in 1952. The first widely used psychiatric drug, by 1955 it was already generating significant revenue as an antipsychotic.

2500|$|As a {{psychiatrist}} and medical doctor, Burgess studied personality disorders and other mental illnesses that impair social relations. Working at the Stanford University Medical Center Department of Psychiatry, he showed that the pathology of borderline personality disorder, including chronic depression and self harm, is linked to impaired neurocognition—the ability to perform normal thought processes. He published numerous freely-available neuropsychological tests to measure human cognition, violence, and self-harm, and to improve the accuracy of medical diagnosis, including the Card Test [...] and the Personality Inventory Scales. He has written books for individuals with bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, their caretakers, and their families; as well as books and clinical articles on DSM-5 and ICD-10 diagnosis, cognitive testing, and psychotherapy and <b>psychopharmacology</b> treatments for use by internal medicine doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, nurses, and mental health counselors.|$|E
