40|$|This report {{outlines}} {{a framework}} of the overall process of prioritising targets for biological control and includes a decision support tool that enables policy makers to determine whether biological control is a suitable option for a proposed target species. Introduction Establishing effective biological control agents in Australia is costly in both resources and time, yet it is often a valuable component of weed control. It {{has been estimated that}} biological control of weeds in Australia has provided around 10 billion worth of agricultural protection over the past century. To date significant investment has been made in the selection process of biocontrol agents and the identification of priority weeds for biocontrol. However there is no nationally agreed system that facilitates prioritisation of weed targets for biological control. The Department of Agriculture commissioned ABARES to develop:• a framework that outlines the overall process of prioritising targets for biological control and• a decision support tool that enables policy makers to determine whether biological control is a suitable option for the proposed target species. A recent work related to the selection and prioritisation of weeds for biological control targets was published by Paynter et al 2009 (hereafter 2 ̆ 7 Paynter 2 ̆ 7). Paynter was used as a basis for discussion about how to assist policy makers in assessing whether biocontrol is an appropriate option for weed control. The <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> support tool for policy makers was discussed at a workshop fully recognising that such a system would need to have a science basis that is both transparent and repeatable to be rigorous. The participants were experts in biocontrol or other weed science, state representatives and other relevant stakeholders. The proposal was outlined in a background/discussion paper and provided to participants prior to the workshop. The purpose of the paper was to provide participants with relevant background information and a proposed approach for a decision support tool for policy makers to be debated and progressed at the workshop. Aim of the workshop and background/discussion paper The workshop was held in Canberra on 4 April 2013. The objectives of the workshop were to:• discuss whether the approach based on Paynter is suitable as a decision support tool at the policy level to prioritise targets for biological control• reach a consensus amongst workshop participants on key principles that need to be considered in the prioritisation process of biological control targetsSuggestions made at the workshop are addressed in this report. Many of the concerns raised at the workshop corresponded with the common 2 ̆ 7 core 2 ̆ 7 issues recorded in Paynter. These include concerns about lack of data, the tendency of the framework to overlook weeds outside the Weeds of National Significance, concerns that weightings are arbitrary, and a need for the framework to be able to anticipate emergent weeds and potential future problems. Here, those issues that are relevant to policy have been considered with the acknowledgement that remaining 2 ̆ 7 core 2 ̆ 7 issues need to be addressed elsewhere...|$|E

40|$|Contrary to the {{emerging}} legal advice on the potential role of the European External Action Service (EEAS) and development cooperation under the Lisbon Treaty, this legal brief argues that the stipulations concerning this area contained in the <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Council <b>decision</b> of 25 March 2010 on the EEAS, are entirely consonant with the Treaty.

40|$|Customer {{lifetime}} value (CLV) is {{an established}} relationship marketing-centric approach to evaluating performance: {{based upon the}} significance of a customer, and what resources should be allocated towards maintaining relations - beyond short-term transactional views. The conceptual argument {{presented in this paper}} contributes one very simple, yet significant argument, which is both transactional and relational. Namely, a large portion of humanity believes in a life beyond current existence - the afterlife. Therefore, death in the psyche of such a person does not terminate benefit seeking, and there is value in the afterlife. The aim here is to refine value-based calculations, drawing from varying religious perspectives: reincarnation, heaven, and enlightenment, amongst others. A particular focus has been given to Islamic schools of thought and practices, as a test case and in response to market growth and interest trends. The method adopted uses a conceptual Socratic elenchus approach - drawing from interpretive phenomenological analysis and syllogisms, building on allegorical anecdotal evidence.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with an issue in European law that is historically derived from the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community. The aim is to illuminate the functions and objectives of the European Union that correspond to the provisions of Part Four of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union - Association of the Overseas Countries and Territories. The basic provisions are laid down in the primary law of the European Union {{but there are also}} other documents and legislative acts that lay down more detailed provisions on the given issue and reveal a more complex perspective. The article focuses on the existing legislation regulating the association of overseas countries and territories with the Union. The author first draws attention to the key provisions of the Treaty establishing the EEC that define the purpose, objectives and fundamental principles applied between the Union and the overseas countries and territories.

However, the recent introduction of information technologies do not always lead to development of accounting. As a result, after the introduction of the records of the latest information technologies, accounting development trends are not always observed in practice.

According to estimates made by DG Justice in the Impact Assessment for the Directive {{on the right to}} interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings {COM(2009) 338 final}{SEC(2009) 916, pp. 18 - 19 }, the need for fair and cost-efficient legal translations will increase significantly [...] Qualetra aims at anticipating some serious challenges EU Member States {{will have to deal with}} after the transposition of Directive 2010 / 64 /EU by proposing deliverables that are expected to cater for training and assessment needs experienced by legal translators specialising in the translation of European Arrest Warrants and by legal practitioners working with translators. With an EU-wide format of online training and testing, the project contributes towards facilitating transparent, cost-efficient criminal proceedings in EU courts, guaranteeing the rights of suspected and accused persons as stipulated in Directive 2010 / 64 /EU. In practice, the project focuses on developing translation memories and multilingual terminology, relevant for the translation of European Arrest Warrants, and on developing EU-wide training programmes and testing procedures for legal translators and practitioners. This will have a positive impact on the training of legal translators and practitioners because they will have to interact efficiently with beneficiaries of legal translation services such as police, prosecutors, court staff, judges, lawyers and professionals providing victim support. This paper focuses in particular on the training and assessment work streams of the project, and will present research-based core curricula and training materials for legal translators and legal practitioners, testing, evaluation and assessment procedures, and materials for professionals in specific working conditions related to the translation of European Arrest Warrants and Essential Documents.

40|$|Market {{researcher}} Clarkson Research Studies {{reports that}} Korea's {{total amount of}} ship orders in the first 11 months of 2005 amounted to 13. 9 million compensated gross tonnage (CGT), or about 39 percent of the global market (35. 5 million CGT). This outstrips the combined orders won by Japan (5. 9 million CGT) and the whole of Europe (7. 4 million CGT). Korea is the world s largest shipbuilding nation and Korean shipbuilders are expected to lead the global market for the next decade. Korean firms have secured enough orders for future, especially increased orders for liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers. There are almost 80 shipbuilders in Korea, but nine major shipbuilders, {{who are members of}} the Korea Shipbuilders Association (KSA), take most of the shipbuilding orders. Seven of them are among the world's top 10. The main players are Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI), Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI), Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) and Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction (HHIC). These giant monsters have threatened other shipbuilding nations, especially Europe. The EU has accused Korean shipbuilders of threatening the future of Europe s shipbuilding industry through unfair subsidies and took some actions against Korea as follows. In 1999, European Commission reported to the Council on the situation in world shipbuilding, which showed European yards trapped in a crisis of downward spiraling prices, {{due in large part to}} excess capacities in South Korea. This report promoted the European Commission to issue <b>a</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Council <b>Decision</b> on the signing and conclusion of an International Agreement between the European Community and Korea relating to assistance of the world shipbuilding market. Eventually, the European Communities took Korea to the WTO in 2002, claiming that Korean shipbuilders received subsidies in the wake of the Asian financial crisis of 1997. Moreover the EU has had Temporary Defensive Mechanism for Shipbuilding (the "TDM Regulation"), which is keeping Korean builders from selling vessels in the European market. Norwegian shipbuilding industry also has dramatically declined, being trapped in a crisis since 1998 under pressure by increased competition from Asia, but it survived by shifting production towards the national offshore oil and gas industry and ship equipment manufacturing. Norway becomes a leading manufacturer of ship s gear in the world. Korea is <b>a</b> major market <b>for</b> Norwegian suppliers of ship s gear and related service. Therefore, good prospects for Korean shipyards are good news for the Norwegian supply industry. Trade and investments between Norway and Korea has grown significantly over the past ten years in maritime industry and Korea is today one of Norway's major trade partners in Asia. Norway has one of the world s largest commercial shipping fleets, so Norwegian shipowners are one of major target for Korean shipbuilders. In fact, Norwegian shipowners have built many of their ships at the Korean shipyards. These ships have been big oil tankers, container ships, combination carriers and ro-ro ships. Korean builders eager to take more shipbuilding orders and have focused on building high-tech and high value added vessels e. g. liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers, liquefied petroleum/chemical gas (LPG) carrier and passenger ships. Since the Norwegian petroleum sector is a main national industry and the crews business is well established and developed, a number of shipbuilding contracts between Korea and Norway are likely to rise steadily. Moreover, soaring demand for LNG, driven by rising gas consumption and higher crude oil prices, will boost the number of shipbuilding contracts between Korea and Norway. In short, shipbuilding marker as itself clearly shows the reason why we have to look closely at shipbuilding contracts between Norwegian buyers and Korean builders. My thesis will be <b>a</b> nautical chart <b>for</b> Norwegian buyers and Korean builders when they sail on unclear and risky water (shipbuilding contract) between Norway and Korea. My chart will not encompass all dangerous areas and warnings, because 50 pages are too short to display the Whole Ocean of shipbuilding contract. So I will limit myself to compare and analyze only the most significant clauses relating to Subcontracting in different standard forms under English law. The subcontracting is triple relationship among the buyer, the buyer and a subcontractor. Two parallel disputes concerning same defect thus may arise: i) one between the buyer and the builder and ii) one between the builder and a subcontractor. To avoid discrepancies in the course of judging disputes, they should endeavor to harmonies procedure provisions to avoid two parallel disputes at different fora and with different arbitrators or judges. If it is commercially and practically difficult to do so, the parties shall strive to incorporate reasonable and adequate clauses while considering the peculiar characteristic of subcontracting in the shipbuilding context after carefully analyzing those issues which I will discuses in this study. I will go deep into the issues to answer the following questions What is Subcontracting? in Chapter 3, To what extent is subcontracting permitted? in Chapter 4, To what extent is the builder responsible for the performance of the subcontractor? in Chapter 5 and To what extent is the builder protected in particular by the force majeure clause against delay or non-performance by the subcontractors? in Chapter 6. The answers to these questions can differ much, depending on the different terms and clauses in different shipbuilding contract. So I will attempt to answer the questions based on the Norwegian standard form, HHI, SHI, DSME, and HHIC standard form, comparing and analyzing the terms and clauses in those standard shipbuilding contract forms...|$|R
