5|$|Sand art is {{a special}} art form that is created on the beaches of Puri. The art form is {{attributed}} to Balaram Das, a poet {{who lived in the}} 14th century. Sculptures of various gods and famous <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> created in sand by amateur artists. These are temporary in nature as they get washed away by waves. This art form has gained international fame in recent years. One of the famed sand artists of Odisha is Sudarshan Patnaik. He established the Golden Sand Art Institute in 1995, in the open air on the shores of Bay of Bengal, to provide training to students interested in this art form.|$|E

Even though it is among the six most populous Asian nations. In the past, excessive red tape made firing from jobs, and consequently hiring, difficult. Significant progress in taxation and business reforms has ensured that many firms now are not compelled to operate in the underground economy.|$|E

25|$|Occupation of {{this area}} did not begin on Tetepetl Hill but rather at a {{location}} on the valley floor {{on the north side}} of the hill. This settlement has been named Ojo de Agua by archeologists. It was founded by Otomí people who were joined and strongly influenced by emigrants from the falling Teotihuacan civilization. These <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> referred to as the Teotenancas. Objects from this part of the site show very strong similarities with objects from Teotihuacan and date from 650 to 750 C. E. This is considered to be the first stage of the development of Teotenango.|$|E
25|$|Wherein it {{concerns}} states and rulers, Plato has made interesting arguments. For instance he asks which is better—a bad democracy or a country reigned by a tyrant. He {{argues that it}} is better to be ruled by a bad tyrant, than by a bad democracy (since here all the <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> responsible for such actions, rather than one individual committing many bad deeds.) This is emphasised within the Republic as Plato describes the event of mutiny on board a ship. Plato suggests the ship's crew to be in line with the democratic rule of many and the captain, although inhibited through ailments, the tyrant. Plato's description of this event is parallel to that of democracy within the state and the inherent problems that arise.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Argentina's {{indigenous}} population (known as pueblos originarios) numbered about 600,329 (1.6% of total population); this figure includes 457,363 people who self-identified {{as belonging to}} an indigenous ethnic group and 142,966 who identified themselves as first-generation descendants of an indigenous people. The ten most populous indigenous peoples are the Mapuche (113,680 people), the Kolla (70,505), the Toba (69,452), the Guaraní (68,454), the Wichi (40,036), the DiaguitaCalchaquí (31,753), the Mocoví (15,837), the Huarpe (14,633), the Comechingón (10,863) and the Tehuelche (10,590). Minor but important peoples are the Quechua (6,739), the Charrúa (4,511), the Pilagá (4,465), the Chané (4,376), and the Chorote (2,613). The Selknam (Ona) <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> virtually extinct in its pure form. The languages of the Diaguita, Tehuelche, and Selknam nations have become extinct or virtually extinct: the Cacán language (spoken by Diaguitas) in the 18th century and the Selknam language in the 20th century; one Tehuelche language (Southern Tehuelche) is still spoken {{by a handful of}} elderly people.|$|E

25|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that a third of}} all pregnant women in developing countries are infected with hookworm, 56% of all pregnant women in developing countries suffer from anemia, 20% of all maternal deaths are either directly or indirectly related to anemia. Numbers like this have led to an increased interest in the topic of hookworm-related anemia during pregnancy. With the understanding that chronic hookworm infection can often lead to anemia, many <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> questioning if the treatment of hookworm could effect change in severe anemia rates and thus also on maternal and child health as well. Most evidence suggests that the contribution of hookworm to maternal anemia merits that all women of child-bearing age living in endemic areas be subject to periodic anthelmintic treatment. The World Health Organization even recommends that infected pregnant women be treated after their first trimester. Regardless of these suggestions, only Madagascar, Nepal and Sri Lanka have added deworming to their antenatal care programs.|$|E
500|$|Kneale {{also sought}} to make [...] "a comment on {{television}} {{and the idea of}} the passive audience", depicting a world where the media is controlled by an elite who feed the population with a diet of low-quality programmes and echoing the Orwellian concept of language reduction, where vocabulary has been eroded through exposure to advertising slogans, mediaspeak and predominantly visual media. He later recalled, [...] "I thought people in those conditions would have very, very, reduced language—they wouldn't be really a verbal society any more, and I think we're heading towards that. Television is mainly responsible for it, the fact that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> conditioned to image. The pictures they see on television screens more and more dominate their thinking, as far as people do a lot of thinking, and if you had a verbally reduced society, you would get the kind of language—possibly—that you did get in the play".|$|E
2500|$|... {{substantial}} unofficial and unauthorized {{movements of}} {{people must be}} expected, and these will require considerable force to prevent, for the patience {{of many of the}} persons involved is, and in my opinion with justification, nearing the breaking point.

2500|$|... yields impact: Recent {{increases}} in the human population have placed a great strain on the world's soil systems. More than 6 billion <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> using about 38% of the land area of the Earth to raise crops and livestock. Many soils suffer from various types of degradation, that can ultimately reduce their ability to produce food resources. Slight degradation refers to land where yield potential has been reduced by 10%, moderate degradation refers to a yield decrease from 10-50%. Severely degraded soils have lost more than 50% of their potential. Most severely degraded soils are located in developing countries.|$|E

The Pechanga Band of Luiseño believe their ancestors have lived in the Temecula area for more than 10,000 years. In Pechanga mythology, life on earth began in the Temecula Valley. They call it, [...] "Exva Temeeku", the place of the union of Sky-father, and Earth-mother ("Tuukumit'pi Tamaayowit").

2500|$|Consultant {{pharmacy}} practice focuses more {{on medication}} regimen review (i.e. [...] "cognitive services") than on actual dispensing of drugs. Consultant pharmacists most typically work in nursing homes, but are increasingly branching into other institutions and non-institutional settings. Traditionally consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners, {{though in the}} United States many now work for several large pharmacy management companies (primarily Omnicare, Kindred Healthcare and PharMerica). This trend may be gradually reversing as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients, primarily because many elderly <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings. Some community pharmacies employ consultant pharmacists and/or provide consulting services.|$|E

Since the normal means of supplying and storing water have been severely damaged by the bombing, Yemenis have resorted to collecting water in buckets when it rains. The {{situation has}} led to the spread of disease, including dengue and malaria.|$|E

2500|$|Obesity: Obesity is a {{paramount}} problem, {{especially among}} the poor and socially disadvantaged, in cities worldwide, according to the WHO (Hawkes et al., 2007; Friel, Chopra & Satcher, 2007). The increased amount of obesity can be contributed to the nutrition transition that describes how <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> increasingly turning to high-fat, sugar, and salt food sources because of their availability and price. [...] This food transition has fueled the obesity epidemic. This nutrition transition tends to start in cities because of [...] "greater availability, accessibility, and acceptability of bulk purchases, convenience foods, and 'supersized' portions" [...] (Dixon et al., 2007). [...] Physical activity and exercise is strongly determined by the design of cities, including density of homes, heterogeneous land uses, {{the extent to which}} streets and sidewalks connect, the walkability, and the provision of and access to local public accommodations and parks for recreation and play. [...] These factors, along with increasing reliance on cars, results in the shift of the population toward physical inactivity, which damages health (Friel, Chopra & Satcher, 2007).|$|E
2500|$|Sites such as Facebook are {{becoming}} increasingly popular tools for methods of ending relationships and friendships, proving that although new media is {{being used as a}} tool for connecting with individuals, it is now creating new problems associated with disconnecting from others. Instead of the traditional phone call or face-to-face interaction between individuals, <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> starting to end relationships by simply changing their relationship status, knowing full well that their significant other will see it shortly. The problem with that is that you are left with no closure and the entire online world now knows you are no longer in a relationship. In a 2010 study conducted online, nearly one-quarter of the 1,000 individuals surveyed found out that their own relationship was over by seeing it on Facebook. New media websites have made our private lives much more public, {{especially when it comes to}} breaking up, since updates are able to be immediately viewed by everyone in our networks (which tend to be more people than we would normally tell personally); for example, having friends comment on your newly changed [...] "single" [...] relationship status, and having to explain what happened can be distressing.|$|E
