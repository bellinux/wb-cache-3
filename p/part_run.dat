60|$|Chile, {{as may be}} seen in the maps, is {{a narrow}} strip of land between the Cordillera and the Pacific; and this strip is itself traversed by several mountain-lines, which in this <b>part</b> <b>run</b> {{parallel}} to the great range. Between these outer lines and the main Cordillera, a succession of level basins, generally opening into each other by narrow passages, extend far to the southward: in these, the principal towns are situated, as San Felipe, Santiago, San Fernando. These basins or plains, together with the transverse flat valleys (like that of Quillota) which connect them with the coast, I have no doubt are the bottoms of ancient inlets and deep bays, such as at the present day intersect every part of Tierra del Fuego and the western coast. Chile must formerly have resembled the latter country in the configuration of its land and water. The resemblance was occasionally shown strikingly when a level fog-bank covered, as with a mantle, all the lower parts of the country: the white vapour curling into the ravines, beautifully represented little coves and bays; and here and there a solitary hillock peeping up showed that it had formerly stood there as an islet. The contrast of these flat valleys and basins with the irregular mountains gave the scenery a character which to me was new and very interesting.|$|E

In the eastern half which survived, religious and secular authority were merged in the one emperor.

50|$|In Sweden, {{electrified}} {{commuter rail}} systems known as Pendeltåg {{are present in}} the cities of Stockholm and Gothenburg. The Stockholm commuter rail system, which began in 1968, is similar to the S-Bahn train systems of Munich and Frankfurt such that it may share railway tracks with inter-city trains and freight trains, but for the most <b>part</b> <b>run</b> on its own dedicated tracks, and that it is mainly used to transport passengers from nearby towns and other suburban areas into the city centre, not for transportation inside the city centre. The Gothenburg commuter rail system, which began in 1960, is similar to the Stockholm system, but does fully share tracks with long-distance trains. Other train systems that are also considered as commuter rail but not counted as pendeltåg include Roslagsbanan and Saltsjöbanan in Stockholm, Östgötapendeln in Östergötland County, Upptåget in Uppsala County and Skåne Commuter Rail. Skåne Commuter Rail (Pågatågen) in Skåne County acts also as a regional rail system, as it serves cities over 100 km (62 miles) and over one hour from the principal city of Malmö.|$|E

5000|$|Set in 1963, at a rural {{branch line}} railway station called Hatley, Jack Skinner (Paul Shane) the porter is acting {{stationmaster}} until a replacement is found. Jack deeply loves his wife May (played by Sherrie Hewson {{in the pilot}} episode, with her scenes re-recorded by Julia Deakin when repeated as the first episode of the regular series) who runs the station buffet, but is prone to becoming very jealous of her around other men. Without a station master the station has become rather disorganised: for instance the eternally miserable signalman, Harry Lambert (Stephen Lewis), is so underworked that he is running several sidelines from his signalbox - including hair-cutting, selling fruit and vegetables, repairing bicycles, and taking bets - seeing his signalling duties as a distraction; he frequently speaks of [...] "ruddy trains". The station is <b>part</b> <b>run</b> by the eccentric, easily flustered booking clerk, Ethel Schumann (Su Pollard), who {{is always on the}} lookout for a new man in her life, and whose late-teenaged son Wilfred (Paul Aspden), the product of a relationship with a now deceased American soldier during the war, is the station dogsbody. Wilfred often comes across as stupid, but sometimes displays signs that he is brighter than he appears - for instance, in the episode [...] "The Van", he finds Arnold's missing wife, Jessica.|$|E
5000|$|The band Crack Of Dawn {{started in}} Toronto, Ontario Canada in mid 1970. Back then, Canadian R&B bands were {{typically}} mixed, most often featuring black singers with white musicians and playing predominantly the American hits of the day. Montreal had the Apollo, Club 217 and the Esquire Showbar. Halifax had the Arrow Club and Club Unusual. And while other Canadian cities {{had their own}} scenes, Toronto was hitting its high water mark with the legendary Club Bluenote, Le Coq D'Or, the Colonial, The Generator and others along the Yonge Street strip. [...] By {{the end of the}} decade, black R&B artists like Dianne Brooks, Shirley Matthews, Eric Mercury, Jackie Richardson and Shawne and Jay Jackson had crossed over to white audiences, while white singers like David Clayton-Thomas and mixed bands like Motherlode and Bobby Taylor and the Vancouvers continued to carry the torch. Even blue-eyed soul bands like Mandala were making it big. But by the mid-70's, the font of Toronto R&B music had for the most <b>part</b> <b>run</b> dry. Yonge Street had changed - the clubs had either closed or changed over to discos. In fact, Toronto itself had quietly grown through its own metamorphosis with burgeoning West Indian immigration influencing the very soul of the city. [...] Two such relatively new West Indian immigrants at the time were guitarist Rupert Harvey and trombonist Trevor Daley. The two had met during a stint in the Toronto band the Cougars, which then featured the legendary Jamaican pianist/songwriter (“Pass the Dutchie”) Jack Mittoo - a new immigrant to Toronto himself. Daley remembers the tribulations confronting black music in Toronto at the time and the legacy gap between the late 60's and mid-70's: “Back in the '74, the Cougars was just about it. Of course I had heard of Diane Brooks, Jackie Richardson and all those people - they were household names. But black Canadian artists were hard to find with the clubs having reverted back to booking American R&B acts by then.” [...] Daley and Harvey decided to strike out on their own, along with another Cougar member - saxophonist Alvin Jones. And here is where the distinctly Canadian cultural mix that would epitomize Crack of Dawn began to simmer. Alvin had immigrated with his family at an early age and culturally was as Canadian as anyone born in the country. The group then added Mark Smith, a bassist actually born in Canada. And trumpet player Dwight Gabriel, along with his sister Jackie Gabriel on vocals, came next. The two were from Springhill, Nova Scotia, a community with deep Afro-Canadian roots. With Carl Otway - a recent immigrant from Grenada - then coming in on drums, one might think the cultural balance would have then shifted more towards the Caribbean, and most likely to reggae with the band's strong Jamaican contingent. But there was a powerful eighth member of the group who was never to rehearse in his basement while he provided direction and shaped the sound. With his Nova Scotian roots, Grant moved the group more in a North American direction. But with three of original members being recent immigrants, the group naturally evolved as an essentially Canadian experience. [...] With rehearsals in Grant's basement regularly running until the sun came up, Alvin suggested the band be called Crack of Dawn, the time of day when they hit their mark and accomplished night's objective. As the band began to make their way through {{what was left of the}} Toronto club scene, Rupert brought his older brother Carl into the group as lead guitarist. Around that time, another major shift occurred with Jackie leaving the band and singer Glen Ricketts replacing her. Ricketts had immigrated to Canada in 1969, but had returned to his native Jamaica to pursue a successful music career before returning to Toronto. At this point, the classic Crack of Dawn was formed, melding their wide cultural influences with principle songwriting from Ricketts and the Harvey brothers. And within a year, history was made by way of a recording contract with Columbia Records in 1975, thus distinguishing Crack of Dawn as the first black band to be signed by a major record company in Canada and so paving the way for generations of Canadian R&B and reggae musicians in the future. [...] Crack of Dawn's self-titled album was released in 1976 and met with instant success. With radio embracing a long succession of singles that included “It's Alright (This Feeling)”, “Keep The Faith” and “The Key”, touring became intense. Having added keyboards from label-mate Dwayne Ford in the studio, the band brought in Jacek Sobotta to round out the sound on the road. Bassist Mark Smith then left the band and was briefly replaced by Keith Jones, with Andre King (originally from Trinidad) permanently holding down the bottom thereafter. [...] After a year of criss-crossing the country from Vancouver to Halifax, Crack of Dawn sadly decided to call it a day, citing the old affliction of musical differences that plagues so many bands. Everyone then went their separate ways, with most staying in music: Ricketts moved back to Jamaica and began a successful solo career; Rupert Harvey went on to form the successful reggae act Messenjah; Carl Harvey and drummer Otway became independent producers, with Carl producing most of Messenjah's albums and the hit single [...] "Hands Up" [...] by Sway, and playing lead guitarist for Toots And The Maytals for more than 25 years; King continued as a musician and then taught music at Toronto Separate School Board; Dwight Gabriel got into session work; Jones pursued entrepreneurial opportunities and also a successful investment adviser; and Daley set up a management company to handle the careers of Messenjah and several others.|$|E
