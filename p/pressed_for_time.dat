[...] The fleet sailed down the coast in close support, a source of supplies and a refuge for the wounded. [...] Aware of the ever-present danger of enemy raiders and the possibility of hit-and-run attacks, he kept the column in tight formation with a core of twelve mounted regiments, each with a hundred knights. [...] The infantry marched on the landward flank, covering the flanks of the horsemen and affording them some protection from missiles. [...] The outermost ranks of the infantry were composed of crossbowmen. On the seaward side was the baggage and also units of infantry being rested from the continuous harassment inflicted by Saladin's forces. Richard wisely rotated his infantry units to keep them relatively fresh.|$|E
