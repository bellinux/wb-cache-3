5|$|The Power Pilot Scholarship (PPS) {{program is}} a seven-week course that allows cadets to get their private pilot licence and their Air Cadet Power Pilot Wings. A goal for many cadets within the <b>program</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> secure a private pilot licence prior {{to the age of}} 19. Cadets who are aged 17–18 apply and are {{selected}} to write an exam and interview for the prestigious scholarship. The course provides cadets with both ground school training and in-flight instruction at the various flight centres across Canada. Cadets who have been successful within the program have integrated themselves with commercial airlines, the Canadian Forces, various courier and charter companies, and have also gone on to become instructors at various flight schools. Overall, this opportunity to attain a private pilots’ licence remains {{as one of the most}} prestigious and attractive opportunities available within the Air Cadet program.|$|E
