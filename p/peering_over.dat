5|$|The {{ferocity of}} the fight {{convinced}} Black Hawk that Apple River Fort was impossible to defeat. He considered burning the fort, but feared the rising smoke would alert other militia in the area. His war-party slackened their fire as their fellow braves raided cabins near the fort. Taken were meat, flour, clothing, cooking utensils. Left behind was a paucity of real vandalism. Braves then raided the livestock: horses were run off and pigs and cattle were shot down and the choicest cut of meat taken. In the gathering darkness, Black Hawk quietly withdrew his war party and retreated back to the gap in Terrapin Ridge and gained the Galena Road. Casualties were few, given {{the intensity of the}} battle. Courier George Harkleroad was shot in the neck early in the battle and died; it has been documented that he was killed while <b>peering</b> <b>over</b> the stockade wall's pickets. Besides Welch, the only other garrison casualty was Josiah Nutting, who suffered a non-lethal wound to the side of his head. The number of Sauk casualties is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after daybreak, Union cavalry (a {{company of}} Ringgold Cavalry) crossed the ford on the South Branch {{at the north}} end of Hanging Rocks pass and its columns marched onto the pike below the {{awaiting}} Confederate militamen. Initially, the Confederates atop the rocks lied flat trying to ascertain through the fog whether the approaching cavalry were their returning scouting party. The Union troops at the base of Hanging Rocks were naturally suspicious of the strategic location and were on high alert as they crossed the ford and made their way onto the pike. The Union troops noticed heads of the Confederate militamen <b>peering</b> <b>over</b> the cliffs and fired upon them. The Confederates responded to the firing by hurling the boulders onto the road below causing the Union cavalry to hastily retreat down the pike and across the ford. In their hasty retreat, several of the Union cavalry ran over their infantrymen forcing them into the river, where at least five drowned.|$|E

25|$|Stone was {{in command}} at the fort during two war-related incidents. In the days {{immediately}} preceding June 18, 1832, Apple River Fort's stables were broken into and horses were stolen during the night. This incident {{was one of}} several around that time which led Illinois militia officer James W. Stephenson to clash with British Band warriors at Waddams Grove on June 18. On June 24, the Battle of Apple River Fort commenced at the fort. Approximately 150200 Sauk and Fox warriors under the command of Black Hawk attacked the fort, which was defended by about 25 militia. The militia was shorthanded during the battle, as most of the fort's detachment were not present. Inside the fort, the people of the nearby settlement had taken refuge. One woman, Elizabeth Armstrong, was singled out for her bravery after the battle. She rallied the fort's women to assist during the battle by making musketballs and reloading weapons. Fierce fighting ensued for at least 45 minutes with both sides exchanging heavy gunfire. Believing the fort to be more heavily defended than it was, Black Hawk and his band eventually retreated. Casualties were few, given the intensity of the battle. Militia member George Herclerode was shot in the neck or head early in the battle and died; it has been documented that he was killed while <b>peering</b> <b>over</b> the stockade wall's pickets. The number of Sauk casualties is unknown.|$|E
500|$|As {{a member}} of Black Sabbath, Gillan was {{required}} to learn their old repertoire, but had difficulty remembering the words. He eventually {{came up with a}} solution of writing the lyrics out on a perspex folder, and balancing it on a wedge monitor, turning the pages with his feet. Unfortunately, the dry ice on stage made it impossible to read the words, resulting the audience witnessing glimpses of him <b>peering</b> <b>over</b> the microphone to sing a few lines, then disappearing below the dry ice to read the next set. As well as material from Born Again, and older Sabbath numbers, the band regularly played Deep Purple's [...] "Smoke on the Water" [...] as an encore.|$|E
500|$|During {{the course}} of the day, Kilmer led a {{scouting}} party to find the position of a German machine gun. When his comrades found him, some time later, they thought at first that he was <b>peering</b> <b>over</b> the edge of a little hill, where he had crawled for a better view. When he did not answer their call, they ran to him and found him dead. According to Father Francis P. Duffy: “A bullet had pierced his brain. His body was carried in and buried by the side of Ames. God rest his dear and gallant soul.” A sniper's bullet likely killed him immediately. [...] According to military records, Kilmer died on the battlefield near Muercy Farm, beside the Ourcq River near the village of Seringes-et-Nesles, in France, on July 30, 1918 at the age of 31. For his valor, Kilmer was posthumously awarded the Croix de Guerre (War Cross) by the French Republic.|$|E

500|$|Bennett {{had been}} at first {{slightly}} in awe of Mendelssohn, but no such formality ever attached to Bennett's friendship with Robert Schumann, with whom he went on long country walks by day and visited the local taverns by night. Each dedicated a large-scale piano work to the other: in August 1837 Schumann dedicated his Symphonic Studies to Bennett, who reciprocated the dedication {{a few weeks later}} with his Fantasie, Op. 16. Schumann was eloquently enthusiastic about Bennett's music; in 1837 he devoted an essay to Bennett in the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik, praising amongst other works Bennett's Op. 10 Musical Sketches for piano, [...] "three of Bennett's loveliest pictures". The essay ends: [...] "For some time now he has been <b>peering</b> <b>over</b> my shoulder, and for the second time he has asked 'But what are you writing?' Dear friend, I shall write no more than: 'If only you knew!'" [...] Bennett however had from the outset some reservations about Schumann's music, which, he told Davison in 1837, he thought [...] "rather too eccentric".|$|E
2500|$|After having checked that no foot traces {{were present}} on the other {{extremity}} of the summit, {{that might have been}} reached by the Italian expedition, Whymper, <b>peering</b> <b>over</b> the cliff, saw Carrel and party at a great distance below. They [...] were precisely at this moment 200 metres below, still ascending and dealing with the most difficult parts of the ridge. Whymper and Croz yelled and poured stones down the cliffs to attract their attention. When seeing his rival on the summit, Carrel and party gave up on their attempt and went back to Breuil. A note appears in Felice Giordano's diary, in which, dated 14 July, is the following note : [...] "... At 2 p.m. they saw Whymper and six others on the top; this froze them, as it were, and they all turned and descended. ..." [...] He wrote a letter to his friend Quintino Sella: ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 8, 2010 EA {{announced}} their title line-ups {{for the year}} with a Harry Potter title slated {{for the third quarter}} of the year. On June 1, 2010 EA and Warner Bros.

Prior to the game's announcement, EA had launched a campaign through the social networking website, Facebook, where users could [...] "like" [...] the page and therefore eventually reveal the first image which depicted the characters Harry, Ron and Hermione in a forest with their wands pointed at the Snatchers. A teaser trailer was released online after the game's announcement in a build-up to the E3 Conference showcasing the battle sequences and gameplay.

2500|$|It is {{most likely}} that an {{observation}} tower for the public will be constructed in the Eastside area as {{it was one of}} the main ideas for it. Originally, there was a proposal named [...] "The Needle" [...] which would be of a substantial height however this was dismissed as a vision. A serious proposal was put forward in September 2007 with the unveiling of VTP200. A public consultation regarding the latest design for the observation tower was announced before a complete planning application is submitted to the planning department at the city council. The proposed VTP200 would be a 200 metre tall [...] "VerTiPlex", the tallest observation tower in Britain, has been designed by RTKL to be a [...] "bold and dynamic icon for Birmingham and the West Midlands in the 21st Century". The tower would consist of three rides including an eight-person vertical drop free falling lift, a see-saw <b>peering</b> <b>over</b> the edge of the tower at 125 meters high and 20 flight trainers spinning around the tower 110 meters up it. As well as rides other extreme activities are proposed including a [...] "Walk of fear", the ability to climb to the top of the tower, a sky jump descending 100 metres and the UK's highest controlled bungee jump. In its first year the VTP200 would hope to receive 1.05 million visitors.|$|E
