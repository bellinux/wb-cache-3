40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the relationship between the peel force required to remove the medical adhesive tapes and the angle of peel. Method : Three kinds of adhesive tapes to fix gauze, 25 mm in width and 125 mm in length (Tape A, B and C) were stuck on a bakelite board for 30 minutes, and then removed while the <b>peel</b> <b>forces</b> were recorded. Peel force measurements were obtained at 30 °, 60 °, 90 °, 120 °, 150 °, and 170 °. Tape A was rayon non-woven fabric coated with an acrylic adhesive. Tape B was poly vinyl chloride tape coated with a rubber adhesive. Tape C was polyethylene film coated with an acrylic adhesive. Results: For all tapes used, the maximal peel force occurred at peel angle 30 °. The <b>peel</b> <b>forces</b> at 30 ° were three times the minimal <b>peel</b> <b>forces</b> which were observed at 90 ° to 120 ° for Tape A, 120 ° to 170 ° for Tape B, and 90 ° to 150 ° for Tape C. Conclusion : These findings suggest that a peel angle near 120 ° might be commonly good for less irritation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{peel test}} {{is a very}} simple and fast method to {{determine}} the adhesion of interconnector ribbons to solar cell metallizations. It {{is part of the}} solar cell standard DIN EN 50461 and is, due to its ease of use, widely accepted to qualify cell metallizations and the soldering process. In the standard a force of 1 N per mm of joint width is specified but other relevant quantities are missing, for example the peeling angle. We show that this lack of specification enables the manipulation of peel testing results. We therefore apply the mechanical theory of Kinloch [1] where measured <b>peel</b> <b>forces</b> are translated into adhesive fracture energies GA. The fracture energy is a geometry-independent parameter that describes the energy to break the interfacial bondings at the peel front. It incorporates the dimensions of the ribbon and its stress-strain-curve. We perform 86 peel experiments at 90 °, 135 ° and 180 ° of ribbons on continuous front side busbars of cells from one stringing batch. While the median forces for 90 °(3. 07 N), 135 °(2. 35 N) and 180 °(3. 39 N) differ by up to 30. 4 % we find the median adhesive fracture energies to deviate by only 17. 4 %. Using the same adhesive fracture energy (260 J/m 2) for a 45 ° peel test we expect <b>peel</b> <b>forces</b> of 7. 45 N which is factor 2. 4 (2. 2) higher than the 90 ° (180 °) <b>peel</b> <b>forces...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{peel test}} of soldered/glued ribbons on solar cell metallizations is the {{critical}} test in the PV industry and research community to qualify the integrability of cells into modules. It {{has been shown that}} the peeling angle of the test setup strongly influences the measured <b>peel</b> <b>forces</b> [1, 2], leading to higher forces for decreasing peeling angles < 90 ̊ and weakest forces for 135 ̊. Here, we apply the theory of Kinloch and Kawashita [3, 4] to determine the adhesive fracture energies GA from 180 ̊ peel tests of three different ribbons which differ in compliance (softness) and thickness. The experiments show that the soft ribbon (σy = 62 MPa) gives lower <b>peel</b> <b>forces</b> than the stiff ribbons (σy = 99 MPa) while the adhesive fracture energies are higher. The thickness variation from 150 μm to 200 μm of the hard ribbon has no significant effect on the adhesive energy. Furthermore, our investigation confirms that switching from 90 ̊ peeling angles to 180 ̊ helps to reduce silicon fracture patterns at high forces. In conclusion, the adhesion does not only depend on the surface properties of cell metallization schemes and soldering conditions, but also on the choice of ribbon used for the peel test. We therefore recommend to use the adhesive fracture energy GA instead of the normalized <b>peel</b> <b>forces</b> to improve the consistency and comparability between different peel testing setups and ribbon materials as the peel test is essential for accepting (or rejecting) novel metallization concepts (plating, metallization pastes) and interconnection technologies (low melting solder alloys, conductive adhesives) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{specific}} peel system low-density polyethylene/isotactic poly-butene- 1 (PE-LD/iPB- 1), {{which is}} often used for protective packages, was investi-gated in this study. The required <b>peel</b> <b>force</b> to open the package depends {{on the content of}} iPB- 1 and on the processing conditions of the blowing process. Commer-cial products have a constant amount of iPB- 1. Thus, a defined <b>peel</b> <b>force</b> can be adjusted by varying the processing conditions. The standard peel system PE-LD with 6 wt % iPB- 1 was investigated in dependence on the processing conditions. The most important processing parameters of the processing line (extruder, die head, tube forming area) were varied and their influence on the peel properties was examined. For example the temperatures of the melt within the extruder, the size of the die gap within the die head, and the cooling behavior of the film bubble were investigated. Higher melt temperatures within the extruder decreased the <b>peel</b> <b>force.</b> The investigations also revealed a strong dependence of the <b>peel</b> <b>force</b> {{on the size of the}} die gap and on the degree of cooling. The new developed parameter time of solidification was used to characterize the cooling behavior.

In 10 subjects, 8 segments of acrylic adhesive tape were placed on both thighs and peeled off 24 hours later at 6 different angles (30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 degrees).

40|$|Symmetrically bonded {{thin and}} {{flexible}} T-peel specimens, when tested on vertical travel machines, can {{be subject to}} significant gravitational loading, with the associated asymmetry and mixed-mode failure during peeling.

40|$|Abstract. It was {{investigated}} that {{the influences of}} the peeling behavior of adhesive tapes in peeling tests on IC chip pick-up performance. Needles peel off an IC chip with an adhesive film from the base material in the pick-up process, by sticking out the backside of the base material. In {{the case that the}} <b>peeling</b> <b>forces</b> of the adhesive tape decrease as the peeling speeds increase in peeling tests, only two kinds of behaviors were observed in pick-up test; the peeling propagated little and the IC chip was not peeled off under critical needle displacement while the pick-up was completed instantaneously over critical needle displacement. In the case that the <b>peeling</b> <b>forces</b> of the adhesive tape increase as the peeling speeds increase, the pick-up time decreased as the needle displacement increased. As a result, it can be concluded that the needle displacement where the peeling propagates instantaneously is critical for succeeded pick-up if the <b>peeling</b> <b>forces</b> of the adhesive tape decrease as the peeling speeds increase.

To achieve solderability a sputter deposited Ni:V and an Ag layer are deposited onto the evaporated Al layer. Tin-coated Cu-connectors with a lead-free and a lead-containing solder are employed in combination with two halogen-free no-clean fluxes with varying solid contents. The long-term solderability of the metallization stack is demonstrated by comparing 180 ¡ <b>peel</b> <b>forces</b> (DIN EN 50461) of Cu-connectors soldered onto the metallization stack directly after preparation, after accelerated storing following IPC J-STD- 003 B and after storing for half a year at room temperature.

For encapsulation an EVA foil and a silicone elastomer are used as encapsulation materials. As the lead-containing solder does not adhere sufficiently after accelerated aging, the flux with high contend of solids may accelerate corrosion and the EVA laminates exhibit adhesion problems between the samples and the lamination foil.

We attribute the too high power degradation after damp-heat test to residuals of the acidic flux which was used for soldering the cells in this first, older version of the developed technology...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{evaluate}} the stresses generated at bracket-cement and the tooth continuum by different bracket debonding techniques commonly used in orthodontic clinic. Materials and methods: Peeling, twisting and masticatory force of one Newton was applied on the finite element model of bracket-cement and the tooth assembly and the principle stresses were obtained through the ANSYS software. The validated three-dimensional finite element model of the bracket-cement-tooth system constructed for the study consisted of 40, 536 nodes and 49, 201 finite elements. Results: The results showed that the debonding stresses generated by masticatory and twisting forces were 4. 781 MPa and 4. 140 MPa respectively on enamel, whereas <b>peeling</b> <b>force</b> produced 3. 480 MPa stress on the enamel. Conclusion: <b>Peeling</b> <b>force</b> produced less stress on enamel suggesting peel load is best to debond the orthodontic bracket...|$|R
40|$|Seven {{empirical}} equations {{were developed}} for the prediction of seal strength for medical device trays. A new methodology was developed and used for identifying burst and peel locations and comparing burst pressure and <b>peel</b> <b>force.</b> Multiple linear regression was used to fit 76 models, selecting the best models based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and adjusted R 2 (R 2 adj) value of each model. The selected models have R 2 adj and prediction R 2 (R 2 pred) values of. 83 to. 94. Factors investigated for the <b>peel</b> <b>force</b> response were sealing pressure (3 levels), dwell time (3 levels), sealing temperature (3 levels), and adhesive. Additional factors investigated for the burst pressure response were restraining plate gap, and tray volume, height, length-to-width ratio and area. Polyethylene terephthalate-glycol (PETG) trays with Tyvek 1073 B lids and two popular water-based adhesives were used. Trays were selected to yield three levels of area and three levels of length-to-width ratio, defining nine package configurations. Packages for burst testing were sealed under a fractional factorial design with 27 treatments. Packages for peel testing were sealed under a 17 -point face-centered central composite design. Packages were tested using peel testing following the ASTM F 88 - 07 standard and restrained burst testing with three gap distances following the ASTM F 2054 - 00 standard. All possible subsets of the factors were evaluated, with the best models selected based on AIC value. Equations were developed to predict peak and average <b>peel</b> <b>force</b> based on sealing process parameters (R 2 pred =. 94 and. 92), burst pressure based on tray and sealing parameters and gap (R 2 pred =. 94), and four <b>peel</b> <b>force</b> responses based on burst pressure and gap (R 2 pred =. 83 to. 86). Models were validated through cross-validation, using the prediction error sum of squares (PRESS) statistic. The R 2 pred was calculated to estimate the predictive ability of each model...|$|R
