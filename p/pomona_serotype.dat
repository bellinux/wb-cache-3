40|$|A {{macroscopic}} plate {{test was}} found to be reliable and convenient for detection of Leptospira <b>serotype</b> <b>pomona</b> antibodies in bovine sera. However, the procedure was unreliable for detecting L. serotype canicola antibodies because of false positive reactions. An indirect immunofluorescence test and the microscopic agglutination test provided comparable results and they effectively detected <b>serotype</b> <b>pomona</b> antibodies in bovine sera...|$|R
40|$|Leptospira interrogans <b>serotype</b> <b>pomona</b> {{antibody}} titres of 1 : 100 {{or greater}} were detected in 12. 8 % of 408 adult horses from seven of eight sampled herds in Saskatchewan. The geographical {{distribution of the}} seropositive horses was widespread throughout the agricultural area of the province. The geographical distribution and the cumulative increase in prevalence with age suggested that <b>serotype</b> <b>pomona</b> is enzootic in the equine population of Saskatchewan...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to {{investigate}} the relationship between the bacterial pathogen, Leptospira interrogans <b>serotype</b> <b>pomona</b> and some of its mammalian hosts and their cells. Using tissue culture techniques and other in vitro systems, attempts are made to define the parasite - host cell relationship and subsequently the study is extended to the whole mammalian host as exemplified by experimental infections in the sheep and suckling mice. Of particular interest are the mechanisms by which L. interrogans <b>serotype</b> <b>pomona</b> produces disease and also the method by which it arrives and colonises the renal tubules at a time when specific antibody is at a high level in the host. An indirect benefit of this work has been the accumulation of a considerable amount of new information concerning experimental loptospirosis in sheep...|$|R
40|$|The {{range of}} known {{occurrence}} of Leptospira interrogans <b>serotype</b> <b>pomona</b> is extended to Alberta in striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis); {{no evidence of}} L. sejroe was found. Reacting sera from skunks were confined to the southern portion of Alberta and adjacent Saskatchewan, although a number of reactors were found sufficiently further north in Saskatchewan suggesting that a different mode of infection may be functioning there. Of 95 skunk sera from near a dairy farm infected with <b>serotype</b> <b>pomona</b> 40 % were reactors. Of 438 skunk sera from other areas only 5. 7 % were reactors; that difference was suggestive of transmission from cattle to skunks on the dairy farm. Of 22 skunk sera collected near the dairy farm in summer none were reactors, whereas 52 % of skunk sera taken the previous and following winters were. That seasonal difference was not evident among sera from other locations...|$|R
40|$|A {{macroscopic}} agglutination {{test for}} detecting leptospiral antibodies in human sera is described. The test utilizes a stained preparation of non-pathogenic leptospires and is {{performed on the}} Brewer diagnostic cards used for bovine brucellosis screening. The agglutination of the stained antigen is more easily observed than the current macroscopic slide test using unstained leptospiral antigens. The non-pathogenic serotype patoc is agglutinated by sera from humans infected with <b>serotypes</b> <b>pomona,</b> hardjo, ballum, and copenhageni with a sensitivity of 94 % {{in comparison with the}} microscopic agglutination test...|$|R
40|$|Serological {{examination}} of 533 Mephitis mephitis between December 1974 and July 1977 {{showed that the}} prevalence of <b>serotype</b> <b>pomona</b> was 11. 4 % {{and that it was}} higher in southern Alberta and adjacent areas of Saskatchewan than previously reported. Prevalence of antibodies among 94 skunk near an infected dairy farm was 40 %, considerably higher than in the 438 skunk from elsewhere 5. 7 %, suggesting transmission from cattle to skunk. No reactors were found among 22 skunk near the farm in summer, but 52 % of 72 serum samples collected in the previous and following winters were positive. No such seasonal variation occurred in other areas. No antibody to L. sejroe was found in any sample. ...|$|R
40|$|Cross-neutralization {{studies on}} leptospiral hemolysins from strains of two antigenically {{different}} <b>serotypes,</b> <b>pomona</b> and canicola, {{were conducted in}} sheep. A third strain of serotype hardjo that does not produce hemolysin and is antigenically distinct was included for control purposes. Concentrated hemolysins, prepared from supernatant fluids of canicola or pomona cultures, produced hemolytic anemia in sheep after intravenous injection. Sheep previously infected with hemolysin-producing strains were refractory to effects of homologous or heterologous hemolysins. On the other hand, infection with hardjo did not confer immunity to the action of hemolysins. Hemolysin-neutralizing antibodies were demonstrable in sheep previously infected with pomona or canicola only after challenge with homologous or heterologous hemolysins. Cross-neutralization between two hemolysins were demonstrable in vitro. Hemolysin-neutralizing antibody titers did not correlate with agglutinin titers. Concentrated supernatant fluid of the hardjo culture provoked toxic reactions predominantly in sheep previously infected with pomona or canicola. The causes of these untoward reactions were not determined...|$|R
40|$|P H o s P H OLI P I D s {{appear to}} serve as {{important}} nutrient substrates for leptospir ae. Fulton and Spooner (1956) reported that the phospholipid fraction of blood serum supported the respiration of Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae. Ivler (1960) found that the oxygen consumption of one saprophytic strain of leptospira was increased {{by the addition of}} lecithin to the culture medium. Johnson and Wilson (1960) showed that a crude lecithin fraction of egg yolk supported good growth of the <b>serotype</b> <b>pomona</b> and could replace rabbit serum in culture media for leptospirae, and Mifuchi, Hosoi and Yanagihara (1961) found that the serotypes canicola and australis could grow in a medium that contained phospho-lipid fractions of an alcoholic extract of egg yolk instead of rabbit serum. Very {{little is known about the}} enzymatic degradation of phospholipids by leptospirae, though some findings have been reported by Addamiano and Papa (1966). Since they contain each of the major types of phospholipids, the lipo-proteins of blood serum are very suitable substrates for rase in investigations of the degradation of the phospholipids. The susceptibility of the serum phospho...|$|R
40|$|Metabolic {{studies were}} {{performed}} on three representative serotypes of Leptospira: a water isolate designated B 16 and two pathogenic <b>serotypes,</b> <b>pomona</b> and schueffneri. Examination of whole cells of B 16 {{for their ability to}} oxidize various substrates revealed that oleate significantly stimulated oxygen uptake. The respiratory quotient of 0. 7 implied that oleate was degraded to carbon dioxide and water. Other substrates, such as carbohydrates, alcohols, intermediates of the citric acid cycle, and short-chain acids, including selected amino acids, did not stimulate endogenous respiration of whole cells. No oxygen uptake could be measured when cell-free extracts were tested with the substrates used with whole cells. Enzymatic analyses of cell-free extracts of the three strains demonstrated enzymes of the citric acid cycle, enzymes of the glycolytic and pentose pathways, and the general acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase required for Î²-oxidation of fatty acids. Strain B 16 and the two pathogenic serotypes appeared to possess similar metabolic capabilities. Enzymatic data might also explain the apparent inability of B 16 to oxidize other substrates; kinases necessary for activation of common nonphosphorylated compounds were not detected in leptospiral extracts. These findings emphasized the dependence of leptospiral growth upon long-chain fatty acids...|$|R
40|$|Leptospirosis occurs enzootically {{over most}} of Southern Ontario. Leptospira <b>pomona</b> is the <b>serotype</b> most {{commonly}} found in outbreaks. Antibodies to L. pomona occur frequently in the sera of deer in wilderness areas. The geographic location of leptospirosis presents a pattern which closely parallels the distribution of Paleozoic bedrock. By contrast, L. pomona infection is absent from areas underlain by Precambrian bedrock. Comparisons of water chemistry, soil type, habitat, and host and pathogen availability in these two geologically distinct environments have not defined the mechanisms involved in the disease pattern. Leptospires resembling saphophytic strains occur widely, regardless of bedrock type. High titers to L. biflexa, a saprophytic serotype, were found frequently in deer sera from a Precambrian area which was surveyed intensively. Antibodies to L. hardjo and L. sejroe occur in many bovine sera from a predominantly Precambrian area where Paleozoic outliers are numerous. Colloidal clay is common to leptospiral habitats. A microenvironment structured by the surface activity of clay {{is likely to be}} a key ecological factor in the landscape epizootiology of leptospirosis. In Ontario, bedrock composed of limestone and dolomite formed in the Paleozoic era appears to be a reliable ecological marker for Leptospira pomona infection...|$|R
40|$|Leptospirosis is an infective disease which {{represents}} serious health {{and economic problems}} in pig raising. The disease is caused by bacteria from genus Leptospira interrogans, which has over 250 serotypes and is isolated from most animal species and also from humans in almost {{every country in the}} world. In farm conditions the disease is seldom manifested as a clinically apparent illness. More often is manifested as reduced conception rate increased abortion rate and increased birth of dead and non-vital piglets. The leptospirosis control and eradication program was made for a state owned farm with a capacity of about 1500 sows and over 30000 fattened animals per year. The farm had an on going endemic leptospirosis infection and subsequent progressive economic losses. We detected 29, 80 % seropositive sows and gilts in which <b>serotypes</b> <b>pomona</b> and icterhaemorrhagiae were isolated. Serologic examination of blood was performed again after program implementation, and no positive animals were found, while production and economic results were improved. The control of leptospirosis and the eradication program for a five-year period were based on detailed quantification of economics losses. Using cost-benefit analysis the necessary inputs and planned outputs were defined, and program evolution was {{made on the basis of}} net present value and benefit/cost ratio...|$|R
40|$|The {{cytochrome}} {{content of}} three leptospiral strains grown in several media was investigated {{after it was}} shown that respiratory inhibitors suppressed oxygen consumption of a water isolate, B 16, and that two pathogenic <b>serotypes,</b> <b>pomona</b> and schueffneri, were active catalase producers, whereas B 16 lacked catalase activity. Reduced minus oxidized difference spectra disclosed cytochromes of the a, c, and c 1 types in all strains. Although no spectral evidence suggested the existence of cytochrome b components, {{they could have been}} masked by cytochrome c, and their presence cannot be ruled out. Carbon monoxide difference spectra revealed peaks indicative of a cytochrome oxidase of the o type in all strains. Carbon monoxide spectra further suggested that a cytochrome a oxidase, possibly a 1 or a 3, and a pigment with absorption spectra different from those of previously characterized cytochromes existed in the two pathogens and not in the water isolate. Physiological reduction of the cytochromes by various metabolic substrates implied that the cytochrome system in Leptospira was functional. No effect of the various growth media on the cytochrome patterns of the three strains was observed, indicating that all three strains were capable of synthesis of cytochrome components and did not require heme prosthetic groups present in serum...|$|R
