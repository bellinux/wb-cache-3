50|$|It shipped {{with either}} a 40-MB or 80-MB {{internal}} hard disk, and a 1.44-MB floppy disk drive. The MC 68882 FPU was an optional extra, mounted on a special <b>plug-in</b> <b>card.</b> Ports included SCSI, two serial ports, an ADB port, a floppy drive port, and 3.5mm stereo headphone sound output and microphone sound input sockets.|$|E
50|$|But the Tiger {{looked more}} like a DEC {{computer}} - it had a (Multibus) backplanethat would hold up to 10 <b>plug-in</b> <b>cards</b> into this mainframe, and was one of if not the first multi-microprocessor based mainframe systems.|$|R

50|$|The {{developer}} of the Eten OS, E-TEN, earned their early profits from sales of their hardware based <b>plug-in</b> <b>card</b> based Chinese system products. Their software (only) Chinese systems were widely copied by many traditional Chinese users and software pirates, {{but this was}} difficult for E-TEN to control. Most traditional Chinese products were compatible with the Eten OS at that time.|$|E
50|$|Wake-on-LAN {{support is}} {{implemented}} on the motherboard {{of a computer}} and the network interface (firmware), and is consequently not dependent on the operating system running on the hardware. Some operating systems can control Wake-on-LAN behaviour via NIC drivers. With older motherboards, if the network interface is a <b>plug-in</b> <b>card</b> rather than being integrated into the motherboard, the card {{may need to be}} connected to the motherboard by an additional cable. Motherboards with an embedded Ethernet controller which supports Wake-on-LAN do not need a cable. The power supply must meet ATX 2.01 specifications.|$|E
50|$|Internally, the {{electronics}} used a motherboard with plug-in daughter cards. The microprocessor, memory, serial interface card, and various optional functions were each on separate cards. This permitted easy field maintenance, upgrades, and reconfiguration. For example, more memory (providing larger scrollback capability) {{could be easily}} added, the serial interface could be changed from RS-232 to current loop, etc. The optional tape drives of the 2645 model were interfaced via another plug-in card.The <b>plug-in</b> <b>card</b> capability strongly resembled the later Apple II expansion architecture. In fact Apple I is derived from a plug-in daughter board inside the 2645 terminal sponsored by Hewlett Packard.|$|E
50|$|Early {{microcomputer}} {{systems like}} the Altair 8800 used a backplane for the processor and expansion cards. A backplane is generally differentiated from a motherboard {{by the lack}} of on-board processing and storage elements. A backplane uses <b>plug-in</b> <b>cards</b> for storage and processing.|$|R
50|$|DATACK*:Data Acknowledge. A slave will assert this signal when to {{acknowledge}} the safe completion of a data transfer via the STEbus. This allows STEbus systems to use <b>plug-in</b> <b>cards</b> {{with a wide variety}} of speeds,an improvement on earlier bus systems that require everything to run at the speed of the slowest device.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the IBM PC and IBM PC/XT, the Model D {{integrated}} video, {{the disk}} controller, a battery backed clock, serial and parallel ports {{directly onto the}} motherboard rather than putting them on <b>plug-in</b> <b>cards.</b> This allowed the Model D to be {{half the size of}} IBM's models. There were four full-length ISA expansion slots available.|$|R
50|$|The Mega II has the {{built-in}} {{equivalent of the}} IOU and MMU chips, video and keyboard ROMs (with support for other display languages) and likely the keyboard encoder found in the IIe. It also has a built-in keyboard and mouse controller (neither {{were used in the}} Apple IIGS). Potentially the Mega II could have been used to produce future models of the 8-bit Apple II with a very low chip count (and reduced physical size) but instead used for IIe emulation on the Apple IIGS and Macintosh LC with <b>plug-in</b> <b>card.</b> It was also used as support circuity on the Apple II Video Overlay Card.|$|E
50|$|The team decided {{early on}} to use a custom {{operating}} system developed for another project, and debated whether to include that in ROM or have the code be downloaded from the host through a boot mechanism. Using ROM would eliminate the long network boot process, but also mean that minor fixes and upgrades would be difficult. For performance reasons, they chose to include the OS on ROM, using a small <b>plug-in</b> <b>card</b> that could be swapped out. Other parts of the system, like the fonts, are downloaded from the host to save room in the ROM. This uses a custom networking mechanism and required a host machine running a server.|$|E
50|$|The {{form and}} size of the {{calculator}} shell is identical to the 49g+ series, but four AAA batteries are used as opposed to three in previous models. In addition to all the features of the 49g+, the 50g also includes the full equation library found in the HP 48G series (also available for the 49g+ with firmware 2.06 and above), as well as the periodic table library originally available as a <b>plug-in</b> <b>card</b> for the 48S series, as of firmware 2.15/2.16 (the latest, as of 2015), and has an 3.3V TTL-level asynchronous serial port in addition to IrDA and USB ports of the 49g+. Like the 49g+, the range of the infrared port has been limited to about 10 cm (4 inches).|$|E
50|$|During the mid-1980s, the {{designer}} of this system, John Adams M.SC., published {{a new version}} of the Scientific Computer - the SC84 (Scientific Computer of 1984). It was based upon a backplane and <b>plug-in</b> <b>cards</b> and modules and featuring a Hitachi HD64180 processor, up to 512 kbytes of RAM and a high resolution colour graphics system.|$|R
50|$|A typical desktop {{computer}} has its microprocessor, main memory, and other essential components {{connected to the}} motherboard. Other components such as external storage, controllers for video display and sound, and peripheral devices may {{be attached to the}} motherboard as <b>plug-in</b> <b>cards</b> or via cables; in modern microcomputers it is increasingly common to integrate some of these peripherals into the motherboard itself.|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the {{microprogram}} {{level of the}} microprogramed processors, microprogram-realized algorithms.

5000|$|PICMG 1.0 is a PICMG {{specification}} {{that defines}} a CPU form factor and corresponding backplane connectors for PCI-ISA passive backplanes. This standard moves components typically {{located on the}} motherboard (i.e. memory, CPUs and chipset components) to a single <b>plug-in</b> <b>card.</b> PICMG 1.0 CPU Cards look much like standard ISA cards with extra gold finger connections for the ISA bus and the root PCI bus. The [...] "motherboard" [...] is replaced with a simple [...] "passive backplane" [...] that has only PCI and ISA connectors attached to it. These backplane connections include a dedicated system slot of the PICMG 1.0 CPU and various connections for standard ISA and PCI peripheral cards. This backplane is simple and robust, with a very low likelihood of failure, given its passive nature. This allows a much lower Mean Time to Repair than classic computer motherboard approaches, as electronics associated with CPUs can be replaced without having to remove peripheral devices.|$|E
50|$|In the U.S., the Radio Shack TRS-80, {{introduced}} in 1977, {{as well as}} the Models II, III, 4, and the proposed Model V, used the Z80. A number of TRS-80 clones were produced by companies like Lobo (Max-80), LNW (LNW-80), and Hong Kong-based EACA (Video Genie and derivatives TRZ-80, PMC-80, and Dick Smith System 80). In the Netherlands a TRS-80 Model III clone was produced that had CP/M capability; this was the Aster CT-80. In the United Kingdom, Sinclair Research used the Z80 and Z80A in its ZX80, ZX81, and ZX Spectrum home computers. These were marketed in the USA by Timex as the Timex/Sinclair series. Amstrad used the Z80 in their Amstrad CPC and PCW ranges and an early UK computer, the Nascom 1 and 2 also used it. The Z80 powered a great many home computers adhering to the MSX standard in Japan, Asia, and to a lesser extent, Europe and South America (some 5 million in Japan alone). Also in Japan Sharp used the Z80 in its MZ and X1 series. In Germany an Apple-CP/M hybrid called the Base 108 paired a Z80 with a 6502. Similarly the Commodore 128 featured a Z80 processor alongside its MOS Technology 8502 processor for CP/M compatibility. Other 6502 architecture computers on the market at the time, such as the BBC Micro, Apple II, and the 6510 based Commodore 64, could make use of the Z80 with an external unit, a <b>plug-in</b> <b>card,</b> or an expansion ROM cartridge. The Microsoft Z-80 SoftCard for the Apple II was a particularly successful add-on card and one of Microsoft's few hardware products of the era.|$|E

5000|$|Architecture - There {{are many}} types of {{computer}} architecture. The most common that people know of is the PC as created by IBM. Many military computer systems are built around alternative plug-in bus structures such as VMEbus or Compact PCI. A military computer may not provide for <b>plug-in</b> <b>cards</b> and be in a dedicated form factor for a specific application such as installation on a UAV such as the Global Hawk.|$|R
50|$|Embedded SBCs are units {{providing}} all {{the required}} I/O with {{no provision for}} <b>plug-in</b> <b>cards.</b> Applications are typically gaming (slot machines, video poker), kiosk, and machine control automation. Embedded SBCs are {{much smaller than the}} ATX-type motherboard found in PCs, and provide an I/O mix more targeted to an industrial application, such as on-board digital and analog I/O, on-board bootable flash memory (eliminating the need for a disk drive), no video, etc.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a prototype <b>plug-in</b> <b>card</b> for PC compatible computers built to manipulate multiresolution images through relationships defined in pyramids. The prototype {{is based on}} a Quadtree storage scheme that allows images to be organized as a regular decomposed picture.

50|$|NABTS, the {{communications}} protocol for embedding {{data in the}} TV signal, also saw continued use after the Telidon project ended. It was widely used for closed captioning support, although not the only system available. It was also used for Microsoft's WebTV for Windows and Intel's Intercast.

50|$|The Model II was {{replaced}} in 1982 by the TRS-80 Model 12, which used half-height ("thinline") double-sided floppy drives, and integrated {{most of the}} Model II electronics into a single main board. The video/keyboard card plugged into a single slot in the main board. An expansion card cage was available as an option, allowing more <b>plug-in</b> <b>cards.</b> The Model 12 was essentially a Model 16B (described below) without the Motorola processor, and could be upgraded to a Model 16B.|$|R
