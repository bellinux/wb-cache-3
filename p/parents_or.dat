5|$|Portrait Diptych of Dürer's <b>Parents</b> (<b>or</b> Dürer's Parents with Rosaries) is the {{collective}} name for two late-15th century portrait panels by the German painter and printmaker Albrecht Dürer. They show the artist's parents, Barbara Holper (c. 1451–1514) and Albrecht Dürer the Elder (c. 1427–1502), {{when she was}} around 39 and he was 63 years. The portraits are unflinching records of {{the physical and emotional}} effects of ageing. The Dürer family was close and Dürer may have intended the panels either to display his skill to his <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> as keepsakes while he travelled soon after as a journeyman painter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spirit}} of Christian philanthropy, the Byzantine world showed {{particular}} care towards the weaker members of society, including widows, orphans, the sick or the elderly. Orphans were either adopted by foster <b>parents,</b> <b>or</b> sheltered in monasteries or in orphanages, the latter often run by monasteries.|$|E
5|$|Between {{chapters}} in which Penelope is narrating, the twelve maids speak on topics from their point-of-view. They lament their childhood as slaves with no <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> playtime, sing of freedom, and {{dream of being}} princesses. They contrast their lives to Telemachus' and wonder {{if they would have}} killed him as a child if they knew he would kill them as a young man. They blame Penelope and Eurycleia for allowing them to unjustly die. In Hades, they haunt both Penelope and Odysseus.|$|E
50|$|Adoption is {{a process}} whereby a person assumes the {{parenting}} of another, usually a child, from that person's biological <b>or</b> legal <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> <b>parents,</b> and, in so doing, permanently transfers all rights and responsibilities, along with filiation, from the biological <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> <b>parents.</b>|$|R

25|$|If {{under age}} 18, written consent from the underage partner's <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> legal {{guardian}} and {{a court order}} must be obtained. A certified copy of the court order must be mailed with the domestic partnership declaration form. If no <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> legal guardian exists <b>or</b> if no <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> legal guardian is capable of consenting, a court may provide the underage person consent to establish a domestic partnership.|$|R
5|$|Education of {{the young}} was never {{considered}} to be the primary domain of schools, even after they had become more common. Most education was carried out by a child's <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> foster parents. Formal apprenticeships were not the norm in Plymouth; it was expected that a foster family would teach the children whatever trades they themselves practiced. The church also {{played a central role in}} a child's education. As noted above, the primary purpose of teaching children to read was so that they could read the Bible for themselves.|$|E
5|$|In {{a divorce}} or child custody case between {{unmarried}} parents, a judge {{will address the}} joint legal custody rights of the parents. In a custody order, it's common for one parent to have physical custody and the other parent {{to have some sort}} of visitation rights, but legal custody is awarded separately. Thus, even when one parent is the primary custodian, joint legal custody may be awarded either to both of the <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> to only one of the parents, depending on state law and the facts of the case.|$|E
5|$|Several of the {{statements}} originated from the juveniles who had been arrested shortly after the murder. They included Jason Hill, the 13-year-old who had been held for three days in his underpants and a blanket, without access to his <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> a lawyer. (Hill received £30,000 in damages from the police over his treatment.) Hill had not been told that his statement {{was going to be}} read out in court during the detectives' trial; he first learned that it had been used when he heard it on television. Another statement was from Mark Pennant, also a juvenile who had been arrested during the first inquiry. Overall it appeared that Silcott was being retried.|$|E
40|$|Business {{entities}} {{today are}} typically {{made up of}} groups of legally separate corporations, subsidiaries and parents, operating as a single enterprise. This volume is concerned with how procedural law treats these legally independent but functionally integrated corporations. Among the most important procedural issues addressed by this volume include: When can jurisdiction over a subsidiary also confer jurisdiction over its <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> other subsidiaries? In an action against a <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> subsidiary, when can a party obtain discovery against the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s non-party subsidiary <b>or</b> <b>parent?</b> When will {{the location of a}} <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> subsidiary be considered in determining whether there is diversity of citizenship for federal court jurisdiction in an action involving a subsidiary <b>or</b> <b>parent</b> company? When will res judicata or collateral estoppel against a non-party <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> subsidiary apply against its subsidiary <b>or</b> <b>parent</b> company? Alternatively, when will res judicata or collateral estoppel in favor of a non-party <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> subsidiary bind a third partry subsequently involved in an action against its subsidiary <b>or</b> <b>parent</b> corporation? This volume considers these and countless other procedural law questions of corporate groups. [URL]...|$|R

5|$|William de Corbeil was {{probably}} born at Corbeil on the Seine, possibly in about 1070. He was educated at Laon, {{where he studied}} under Anselm of Laon, the noted scholastic and teacher of theology. William taught for a time at Laon, but nothing else is known of his early life. All that is known of his <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> ancestry is that he had two brothers, Ranulf and Helgot; his brothers appear as witnesses on William's charters.|$|E

Friends of Tim's testified that Tim had had a fascination with fire and that he had told friends that he knew how to make bombs. A neighbor testified that he had once caught Tim burning some grass in the neighbor's yard. A former nanny testified that she had heard Tim speak about wanting his father dead and planning to burn down the family's house, and had caught him multiple times setting or with the implements to set fires. On cross-examination, she admitted that she had not seen Tim Farrar for years and agreed that she had not reported Tim's fascination with fire to his <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> the police when he had expressed it to her.|$|E
5|$|Once {{patients}} {{reach their}} teens, {{they need more}} specific information about pregnancy, birth control, self-esteem, and dating. Teenagers with lost or reduced genital sensation benefit from education about alternative ways to experience pleasure and satisfaction from sexual acts. The teen years are often particularly difficult for those with SCI, in terms of body image and relationships. Given the importance they place on sexuality and privacy, adolescents may experience humiliation when <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> caregivers bathe them or take care of bowel and bladder needs. They can benefit from sexuality counseling, support groups, and mentoring by adults with SCI who can share experiences and lead discussions with peers. With the right care and education from family and professionals, injured children and adolescents can develop into sexually healthy adults.|$|E

5|$|The Selle Français stud {{book has}} long allowed {{crossbreeding}} {{with four other}} breeds: the Thoroughbred, Arabian, Anglo-Arabian and French Trotter. Today, restrictions exist to harmonize the stud book with directives for other European warmblood breeds. For a Selle Français to be registered, it must be from two registered Selle Français <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> from {{a cross between a}} Selle Français and a facteur de selle français (non-Selle Français horse that has passed stud book selection procedures). Stallions must pass through a selection process before their progeny is allowed to be registered as Selle Français. The process involves an approval committee that judges stallions on criteria based on the age, breed and nationality of the horses. The qualification criteria involve the conformation, gaits, performance and are scored against national indices.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the shift}} in policy from {{educational}} assimilation to integration, the removal of Indigenous children from their families by state officials continued {{through much of the}} 1960s and 70s. The removals were the result of the 1951 addition of Section 88 to the Indian Act, which allowed for the application of provincial laws to Indigenous peoples living on reserves in instances where federal laws were not in place. The change included the monitoring of child welfare. With no requirement for specialized training regarding the traditions or lifestyles of the communities they entered, provincial officials assessed the welfare of Indigenous children based on Euro-Canadian values that, for example, deemed traditional diets of game, fish and berries insufficient and grounds for taking children into custody. This period resulted in the widespread removal of Indigenous children from their traditional communities, first termed the Sixties Scoop by Patrick Johnston, the author of the 1983 report Native Children and the Child Welfare System. Often taken without the consent of their <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> community elders, some children were placed in state-run child welfare facilities, increasingly operated in former residential schools, while others were fostered or placed up for adoption by predominantly non-Indigenous families throughout Canada and the United States. While the Indian and Northern Affairs estimates that 11,132 children were adopted between 1960 and 1990, the actual number may be as high as 20,000.|$|E

Even when children can accurately express their needs, {{they are unlikely to}} receive the same acknowledgment accorded adult patients. In addition, because children are dependent on their caregivers, their care must be approved by <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> surrogates during all encounters.|$|E

25|$|If {{the victim}} is a minor, consent must come from a <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> {{guardian}}.

The <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> guardian is then considered neglecting, and consent for treatment is implied by default because neglect has been committed. Special circumstances may exist if child abuse is suspected (the courts will usually give immunity to those first responders who report what they reasonably consider to be evidence of child abuse or neglect, similar to that given to those who have an actual duty to report such abuse, such as teachers or counsellors).|$|R
