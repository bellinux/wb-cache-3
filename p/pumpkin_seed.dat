5|$|The family Cucurbitaceae {{has many}} species used as human food. Cucurbita species are some {{one of the}} most {{important}} of those, with the various species being prepared and eaten in many ways. Although the stems and skins tend to be more bitter than the flesh, the fruits and seeds of cultivated varieties are quite edible and need little or no preparation. The flowers and young leaves and shoot tips can also be consumed. The seeds and fruits of most varieties can be stored for long periods of time, particularly the sweet-tasting winter varieties with their thick, inedible skins. Summer squash have a thin, edible skin. The seeds of both types can be roasted, eaten raw, made into <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> oil, ground into a flour or meal, or otherwise prepared.|$|E
5|$|Cucurbita {{have been}} used in various {{cultures}} as folk remedies. Pumpkins {{have been used}} by Native Americans to treat intestinal worms and urinary ailments. This Native American remedy was adopted by American doctors {{in the early nineteenth century}} as an anthelmintic for the expulsion of worms. In southeastern Europe, seeds of C. pepo were used to treat irritable bladder and benign prostatic hyperplasia. In Germany, <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> is approved for use by the Commission E, which assesses folk and herbal medicine, for irritated bladder conditions and micturition problems of prostatic hyperplasia stages 1 and 2, although the monograph published in 1985 noted a lack of pharmacological studies that could substantiate empirically found clinical activity. The FDA in the United States, on the other hand, banned the sale of all such non-prescription drugs for the treatment of prostate enlargement in 1990.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pumpkin</b> <b>seeds,</b> {{also known}} as pepitas, are edible and nutrient-rich. They are about 1.5cm (0.5in) long, flat, asymmetrically oval, light green in color and usually covered by a white husk, {{although}} some <b>pumpkin</b> varieties produce <b>seeds</b> without them. <b>Pumpkin</b> <b>seeds</b> are a popular snack {{that can be found}} hulled or semi-hulled at most grocery stores. Per ounce serving, <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seeds</b> are a good source of protein, magnesium, copper and zinc.|$|R
40|$|In the {{traditional}} medicine in North America and Mexico, <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seeds</b> {{have been used}} as an anthelmintic agent and for supportive treatment in functional disorders of the bladder. Also anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective activity of <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seeds</b> is discussed. Three different extracts of <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seeds</b> were prepared and effects were investigated in unstimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in cells stimulated with the mitogens phytohaemagglutinin and concanavalin A in vitro. Tryptophan degradation and neopterin concentrations were measured in the supernatants allowing to detect biochemical changes induced by cytokine interferon-&# 947;. Extracts of <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seeds</b> suppressed mitogen-induced neopterin production and tryptophan degradation in a dose-dependent way.

50|$|<b>Pumpkin</b> <b>seeds</b> contain vitamin E, crude protein, B {{vitamins}} and several dietary minerals (see nutrition table at pepita). Also present in <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seeds</b> are unsaturated and saturated oils, palmitic, oleic and linoleic fatty acids, {{as well as}} carotenoids.|$|R
25|$|<b>Pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> oil, a {{thick oil}} pressed from roasted pumpkin seeds, appears {{red or green}} in color {{depending}} on the oil layer thickness, container properties and hue shift of the observer's vision. When used for cooking or as a salad dressing, <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> oil is generally mixed with other oils because of its robust flavor. Used in cooking {{in central and eastern}} Europe, it is considered a delicacy in traditional local cuisines such as for pumpkin soup, potato salad or even vanilla ice cream. <b>Pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> oil contains fatty acids, such as oleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid.|$|E
2500|$|While herbal {{remedies}} are commonly used, [...] a 2016 review {{found them to}} be no better than placebo. Saw palmetto extract from Serenoa repens, while one of the most commonly used, is no better than placebo in both symptom relief and decreasing prostate size. Other herbal medicines include beta-sitosterol from Hypoxis rooperi (African star grass) and pygeum (extracted from the bark of Prunus africana), while there is less substantial support for the efficacy of <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> (Cucurbita pepo) and stinging nettle (Urtica dioica) root. A systematic review of Chinese herbal medicines found that the quality of studies was insufficient to indicate any superiority over Western medicines.|$|E

60|$|Outside of both {{political}} and literary circles, among Burke's correspondents was that wise and honest traveller whose name is as inseparably {{bound up with the}} preparation of the French Revolution, as Burke's is bound up with its sanguinary climax and fulfilment. Arthur Young, by his Farmer's Letters, and Farmer's Calendar, and his account of his travels in the southern counties of England and elsewhere--the story of the more famous travels in France was not published until 1792--had won a reputation as the best informed agriculturist of his day. Within a year of his settlement at Beaconsfield, we find Burke writing to consult Young on the mysteries of his new occupation. The reader may smile as he recognises the ardour, the earnestness, the fervid gravity of the political speeches, in letters which discuss the merits of carrots in fattening porkers, and the precise degree to which they should be boiled. Burke throws himself just as eagerly into white peas and Indian corn, into cabbages that grow into head and cabbages that shoot into leaves, into experiments with <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> and wild parsnip, {{as if they had been}} details of the Stamp Act, or justice to Ireland. When he complains that it is scarcely possible for him, with his numerous avocations, to get his servants to enter fully into his views as to the right treatment of his crops, we can easily understand that his farming did not help him to make money. It is impossible that he should have had time or attention to spare for the effectual direction of even a small farm.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> oil has {{an intense}} nutty taste and {{is rich in}} {{polyunsaturated}} fatty acids. Browned oil has a bitter taste. <b>Pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> oil serves as a salad dressing. The typical Styrian dressing consists of <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> oil and cider vinegar. The oil is also used for desserts, giving ordinary vanilla ice cream a nutty taste. It is considered a real delicacy in Austria and Slovenia, and a few drops are added to pumpkin soup and other local dishes. Using it as a cooking oil, however, destroys its essential fatty acids.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to examine the}} effect of pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) seeds supplementation on {{androgenic}} diet-induced atherosclerosis. Rat were divided into two main groups, normal control and atherogenic control rats, each group composed of three subgroups one of them supplemented with 2 % arginine in drinking water and the other supplemented with <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seeds</b> in diet at a concentration equivalent to 2 % arginine. Supplementation continued for 37 days. Atherogenic rats supplemented with <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seeds</b> showed a significant decrease (p< 0. 001) in their serum concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL – C as they dropped from 4. 89 mmol / L to 2. 55 mmol /L and from 3. 33 mmol / L to 0. 70 mmol / L respectively. Serum concentrations of HDL-C were also significantly elevated in the same group. Although, atherogenic rats supplemented with 2 % arginine showed significant increase in serum concentration of HDL-C, no significant changes were observed in their serum concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL-C. Our results showed that treatment of atherogenic rats with <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seeds</b> significantly decreased serum concentrations of TC and LDL-C. Our findings suggest that <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seeds</b> supplementation has a protective effect against atherogenic rats and this protective effect was not attributed to the high arginine concentrations in <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seeds...</b>|$|R
