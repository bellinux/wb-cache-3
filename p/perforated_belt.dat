50|$|A Belt dryer / Belt cooler is {{a device}} {{designed}} for the particularly gentle thermal treatment of product. The wet product is continuously and evenly applied through an infeed chamber onto a <b>perforated</b> <b>belt.</b> The belt, predominantly in horizontal position, carries the product through the drying area which is divided into several sections. In these cells drying gas flows through or over the wet product and dries it. Each cell can be equipped with a ventilating fan and a heat exchanger. This modular design allows the drying and cooling temperatures to be controlled separately in the different sections. Thus, each dryer cell can be individually controlled and the drying / cooling air flow can be varied in each cell. In addition, {{the speed of the}} conveyor belt can be varied what gives an additional parameter for setting of drying time.The cells can be heated or cooled directly or indirectly, and all heating media, such as oil, steam, hot water or hot gas can be used.Belt dryers are ideally suited to drying almost any non-flowing product or more granular products that require a lower throughput capacity.|$|E
50|$|The {{concentrated}} juice {{is held in}} a coldwall tank and is stored at or below 35 °F to prevent browning and development of undesired flavors. Next, {{a small amount of}} fresh juice is added to the {{concentrated juice}} to restore natural and fresh flavors of orange juice that have been lost through the concentration process. Specific cold-pressed orange oils are used to restore the lost aroma and volatile flavors. After the addition of fresh juice, the brix content is reduced to 42 °F. The fresh juice is referred to as “cut-back” in the industry and attributes to 7-10% of the total juice. Orange peel oil is also added if the oil content is below the required level. The concentrate is then further cooled in a continuous cooler or coldwall tank to 20 to 25 °F. The concentrate is canned using steam injection methods to sterilize the lid and develop a vacuum in the can. The cans then undergo final freezing where they are conveyed on a <b>perforated</b> <b>belt</b> in an air blast at -40 °F. After freezing, the product is stored at 0 °F in a refrigerated warehouse.|$|E
50|$|<b>Perforated</b> steel <b>belts</b> {{enabling}} the drying media, for example hot air, {{to be transferred}} 'through' the steel belt, so that the air is in contact with {{all parts of the}} product on the belt. Normally, all manufacturer are offers <b>perforated</b> <b>belts</b> with five standard perforation patterns which cover ring most requirements. A broad range of other patterns, with a minimum hole diameter of 0.8 mm (0.03 in.) and different spacing, can be provided to suit specific applications.|$|R
