2500|$|On April 30, 2013, it was {{confirmed}} that Rowland would be co-headlining a US concert tour alongside The-Dream, who produced two songs on Talk a Good Game. Speaking about the tour, Rowland said: [...] "To {{be able to}} work with [...] in this capacity and have the opportunity to showcase our new music to our fans live and in <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be extremely rewarding! I can't wait.". The Lights Out Tour was originally scheduled to have twenty-two shows, but this was later changed to five, after Rowland was forced to cancel many of the shows because she signed on to become a judge on The X Factor US. The tour kicked off on May 26, 2013 in Washington, D.C. and ended on June 2, 2013 in Mashantucket.|$|E
2500|$|For live programs, spoken words {{comprising}} the television program's soundtrack are transcribed by a human operator (a speech-to-text reporter) using stenotype or stenomask type of machines, whose phonetic output is instantly translated into text {{by a computer}} and displayed on the screen. This technique {{was developed in the}} 1970s as an initiative of the BBC's Ceefax teletext service. In collaboration with the BBC, a university student took on the research project of writing the first phonetics-to-text conversion program for this purpose. Sometimes, the captions of live broadcasts, like news bulletins, sports events, live entertainment shows, and other live shows, fall behind by a few seconds. This delay is because the machine does not know what the <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say next, so after the person on the show says the sentence, the captions appear. Automatic computer speech recognition now works well when trained to recognize a single voice, and so since 2003, the BBC does live subtitling by having someone re-speak what is being broadcast. Live captioning is also a form of real-time text. Meanwhile, sport events on channels like ESPN are using court reporters, using a special (steno) keyboard and individually constructed [...] "dictionaries." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{case of a}} [...] "complete control" [...] by the Jinn, the possessed {{surrender}} to the Jinn and the <b>persons</b> consciousness <b>is</b> subverted by it. Such a jinn is indeed absolutely evil and thereupon the acts of the <b>person</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> evil as well. The person will obey the commands of the jinn at anytime.

But instead they both threw {{themselves}} away -- and now they must take what comes." ...|$|E
60|$|Yes, it {{was pretty}} hot weather. Now here, when a <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die, he is always in a sweat about where he is going to; but in Keokuk of course they don't care, because they are fixed for everything. It has set me reflecting, it has taught me a lesson. By and by, when my health fails, I am going to put all my affairs in order, and bid good-bye to my friends here, and kill all the people I don't like, and go out to Keokuk and prepare for death.|$|E
6000|$|... "Esther dear," [...] he said, [...] "I shall do {{just as you}} ask me. At {{the same}} time, please listen. I think that you are all absurdly frightened of Mr. Fentolin. Living here alone with him, you have all grown under his {{dominance}} to an unreasonable extent. Because of his horrible infirmity, you have let yourselves become his slaves. There are limits {{to this sort of}} thing, Esther. I come here as a stranger, and I see nothing more in Mr. Fentolin than a very selfish, irritable, domineering, and capricious old man. Humour him, by all means. I am willing to do the same myself. But {{when it comes to the}} great things in life, neither he nor any living <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> keep from me the woman I love." ...|$|E

I want them on Guantanamo, where they don't get the access to lawyers that they get when they're on our soil. I don't want them in our prisons. I want them there. Some people have said we ought to close Guantanamo. My view is we ought to double Guantanamo.|$|R

"Well, {{why should}} they start a {{perfectly}} rotten action like that," [...] continued Maxwell Hartington, now addressing himself very earnestly to his client, [...] "when they've only got to keep quiet and do their job and be comfortable. In these matters, Brumley, as in most matters affecting the relations of men and women, people can do absolutely what they like nowadays, absolutely, unless there's someone about {{ready to make a}} row. Then they can't do anything. It hardly matters if they don't do anything. A row's a row and damned disgraceful. If there isn't a row, nothing's disgraceful. Of course all these laws and regulations and institutions and arrangements are just ways of putting people at the mercy of blackmailers and jealous and violent persons. One's only got to be a lawyer for a bit to realize that. Still that's not our business. That's psychology. If there aren't any jealous and violent persons about, well, then no ordinary decent <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> worry what you do. No decent person ever does. So far as I can gather the only barbarian in this case is the testator--now in Kensal Green.

5000|$|John Kennedy, {{a native}} of Windsor and a sports {{executive}} based in Los Angeles, was named the first commissioner of the NBL. He previously had experience working with the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). League president Andre Levingston spoke on his expectations of the commissioner, saying, [...] "We {{wanted to make sure}} we had a <b>person</b> who <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> committed and was willing to roll up his sleeves and work very hard, someone who understood business, had business relationship and a <b>person</b> who <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> govern the league the right way."

5000|$|Speaking to NPR in 2012, Grier {{explained}} {{the inspiration for}} his characterization: [...] "I had already done Dreamgirls on Broadway, and being in a musical and working with other performers who were gay, I was privy to that vocabulary backstage. They were being themselves. So {{a lot of it}} was hijacked from what I heard in the theater and what was permeating around. Now at that time, if a gay <b>person</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> read you — to tell you off — it was always accompanied by snaps.

50|$|Psychological noise {{results from}} preconceived notions we bring to {{conversation}}s, such as racial stereotypes, reputations, biases, and assumptions. When we {{come into a}} conversation with ideas about what the other <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say and why, we can easily become blinded to their original message. Most of the time psychological noise is impossible to free ourselves from, and we must simply strive to recognize that it exists and take those distractions into account when we converse with others.|$|E

50|$|Most {{cases of}} false arrest involve accusations of shoplifting, and are brought against {{security}} guards and retail stores. A guard cannot arrest someone merely on {{the suspicion that}} <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> commit a theft.

For example, a guard does not have reasonable and probable cause if a shopper has not yet paid for merchandise they are carrying in the belief that the person intends to leave without making payment. Instead, there must be an actual act committedthe person must make an actual attempt to leave the store without paying for the merchandise.|$|E

If a <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> develop PEX, the average age in which this will happen is between 69 and 75 years, according to the Norwegian study.

Growing up, she was raised {{primarily}} by her mother, Ana Delia because her father {{died when she was}} eight years old. At birth, Novello was diagnosed with Congenital megacolon. This was a painful condition that required Novello to make frequent trips to the hospital. Although Novello was told at eight years old that she should have surgery to correct her problem, it would take another ten years before that would happen. Despite this Novello managed to excel in her study to become a doctor.
