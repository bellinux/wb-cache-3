Within any mass-manufactured dynamic system, parameters such as masses, springs or geometrical attributes can vary from one system to the next. Overall performance or stability of the system can therefore be a function of the extent of uncertainty within the physical parameters. In typical robust control designs, uncertainty models work to account for all possible error within the system.

Smaller dimensions allow smaller flow ranges, but also leave smaller margins for error in performance. Reliable and effective fabrication and assembly procedures are therefore a primary requirement for any microfluidic system, {{if it is}} to be successful in real-world applications. This thesis describes the achievements made in ongoing efforts to create miniaturized, proportional control valves for minute gas flows. In this research we focus on MEMS-based fabrication processes, as they allow high precision manufacturing of miniature devices with high paralellism. This enables higher fabrication yields, improved reliability and increased integration. We present four valve designs that can be divided into two main categories, being either based on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology or based on surface channel technology (SCT). The first group focuses on obtaining a proportional flow controller using simple, straight-forward fabrication processes with a small number of process steps, for use in an ambulant blood pressure waveform (BPW) measurement system. Two single-wafer valve designs are presented, both offering built-in capacitive sensing of the valve displacement which can be used to correct for actuator hysteresis and improve control precision. Nitrogen gas flows up to 13 g h− 1 at a pressure of 500 mbar are demonstrated in good agreement with analytical and numerical models, with leakage below 0. 1 mgh− 1 at 1 bar. Maximum throughput is estimated at 25 g h− 1 at 1 bar. A fully functional control valve assembly is demonstrated with integration of a miniaturized piezoelectric bimorph actuator. Time-dynamic characterization demonstrates that the control valve is suitable for high-speed flow control, with a mechanical bandwidth of 8 kHz and a frequency-independent response up to 3 kHz. The second group demonstrates two <b>proportional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> designs in an already existing (SCT) fabrication process, to allow integration with existing components such as flow sensors. The first valve design allows flow control from a chip inlet or outlet to a fluidic channel embedded in the silicon surface, with a flow range of > 1250 mgh- 1 at 600 mbar and a leak flow below 0. 05 mgh- 1 at 1 bar. The second valve design supports smaller flows (> 70 mgh- 1 at 200 mbar), but allows fully on-chip flow control between any two surface channels. A good fit is obtained between the measured flow profiles and analytical flow models of both valves. The valve designs aimed at the BPW monitoring system are shown to be very well suited for the aimed application, although a smaller bimorph piezo may be required to meet the demanded physical dimensions. The combination of capacitive displacement sensing with bimorph piezoelectric actuation allows for high-speed, high-precision flow control with low power usage. The SCTbased microvalves demonstrate proportional, on-chip flow control, suitable for integration with existing flow sensors. Their designs are tailored to match an existing high-resolution mass flow sensor which has a limited flow range, but the designs of both the valves and the sensor can be scaled up to increase the range...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} measure the amount of fluid that flows from one {{location}} to another is of use {{in a wide variety}} of applications and applications that require very small fluid flows become more and more important. It is often not only the flow of a fluid that needs to be monitored, but also the composition of the fluid. For this, multiple parameters of the fluid need to be measured, preferably using a very small sensing system with a very low volume. In the past, many different microfluidic devices have been introduced that can measure these parameters. However, to integrate these different devices, it is often necessary to use external fluidic interconnects which have a relatively large volume, resulting in slow response times and requiring large sample sizes. For this, the research presented in this thesis is divided into two parts. The first part of the research has been focused towards realization of a microfluidic platform that enables on-chip integration of many different microfluidic devices. This platform allows design of microfluidic channels, right underneath the surface of the device, of many different sizes and shapes integrated on the same chip, with functional structures in close proximity of the fluid. As a result, many different sensing principles can be applied to the fluid to measure its parameters. The second part of the research has been focused on realizing different sensor and actuator systems in this platform. Here the emphasis has been on research on a micromachined Coriolis mass flow sensor. For this, a numerical model has been made that models the mechanical behavior of the sensor under influence of a fluid flow. Using this model, designs have been optimized for specific goals. The optimized designs have been fabricated and characterized. For high sensitivity, a sensor has been made that can measure as low as 14 ng/s while a sensor has been made, optimized for high flows, that can measure as high as 50 g/h at only 1 bar pressure drop. To be able to manipulated the measured flow to reach a preferred set point, two different <b>proportional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> have been realized in the same fabrication process to form a fully integrated Coriolis mass flow controller. Besides Coriolis mass flow sensors, other sensors have been designed, realized and characterized to be able to measure different fluid parameters. Capacitive pressure sensors have been realized {{to measure the}} pressure inside the channel, which also allows measurement of the viscosity of the fluid. Thermal flow sensors have been used together with the Coriolis flow sensors to increase the total dynamic flow range of the sensor or to find thermal properties of the fluid like the specific heat capacity or the thermal conductance. Resonating channels have been used to measure the density of the fluid inside them and in the case of proteins that adhere to the channel wall, the mass of these proteins.

"May 2013 "[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] In this work, a linear technique is used to study the stability of a nonlinear system. Most of dynamic systems in industrial and fluid power systems are nonlinear and include uncertainties. Thus, unexpected changes in the stability can be exhibited and can lead these systems to become unstable exhibit oscillatory behavior. Engineers have been trying to develop nonlinear mathematical models to be able to predict whether or not a designed system will be exposed to such an oscillation before considering building and implementing the system. The focus {{of this study is to}} predict the existence of nonlinear oscillation in a dynamic system. A nonlinear model validation of a solenoid operated <b>proportional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> was performed using open loop testes. The model consists of linear and nonlinear parts. The linear part was developed by linearizing the nonlinear equations governing the operations of the valve at nominal conditions. The nonlinear parts constructed by analyzing open loop tests showed that two major nonlinearities found in the system; saturation effect of the current input and backlash hysteresis behavior of the valve; were considered to be the cause of instability. Each one of these nonlinearities was represented by its linear model and several limit cycles were predicted using the describing function analysis method. In order to control limit cycle behavior, a control system was designed in order to ensure robust stability and performance. Two aspects of the valve system were considered in the design. First, the uncertainty model of the valve operation due to the uncertainty found for the 30 replications of the first stage spool valve was considered. Second, the nonlinearities embedded in the system were considered which can cause stability issues if they have not been considered in the design. Thus, two different controllers were designed and implemented for the system, anti-backlash and H-infinity controllers. Designing both of the controllers in a way that robust stability and performance are to be achieved proved to be the main challenge. A technique was developed to extract the best stability and performance characteristics for each type of controller. Finally, the control system was tested experimentally for all the replications of the valve system. Results showed a significant amount of hysteresis reduction as well as robust stability and performance objectives were me by all the system uncertain replications using the designed controllers...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the Electrohydraulic Power Steering system for road vehicles, using {{electronic}} pressure <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> With an ever increasing demand for safer vehicles and fewer traffic accidents, steering-related active safety functions are becoming more common in modern vehicles. Future road vehicles will also evolve towards autonomous vehicles, with several safety, environmental and financial benefits. A key component in realising such solutions is active steering. The power steering system was initially developed to ease the driver's workload by assisting in turning the wheels. This is traditionally done through a passive open-centre hydraulic system and heavy trucks must still rely on fluid power, due to the heavy work forces. Since {{the purpose of the}} original system is to control the assistive pressure, one way would be to use <b>proportional</b> pressure <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> Since these are electronically controlled, active steering is possible and with closed-centre, energy efficiency can be significantly improved on. In this work, such a system is analysed in detail with the purpose of investigating the possible use of the system for Boost curve control and position control for autonomous driving. Commercially available valves are investigated since they provide an attractive solution. A model-based approach is adopted, where simulation of the system is an important tool. Another important tool is hardware-in-the-loop simulation. A test rig of an electrohydraulic power steering system, is developed. This work has shown how <b>proportional</b> pressure <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> can be used for Boost curve control and position control and what implications this has on a system level. As it turns out, the valves add {{a great deal of time}} lag and with the high gain from the Boost curve, this creates a control challenge. The problem can be handled by tuning the Boost gain, pressure response and damping and has been effectively shown through simulation and experiments. For position control, there is greater freedom to design the controller to fit the system. The pressure response can be made fast enough for this case and the time lag is much less critical...|$|R

40|$|Low energy {{efficiency}} {{is one of}} the main detractors of fluid power technology. To ensure the availability and sustainability of energy sources, fluid power technology needs to meet high energy-efficiency and cost standards. This study aims to design, simulate and test a control algorithm that attenuates the detrimental effects of air compressibility on the performance and efficiency of a pneumatic cylinder. The transmission of power over long distances makes it more difficult for fluid power technology to meet energy-efficiency and cost requirements. Transmitting power over long distances represents a challenge particularly for pneumatics due to the compressibility of air. The compressibility of air transmitted through lengthy tubing decreases the performance and efficiency of pneumatic actuators, mainly affecting their time response and velocity. The system under analysis was composed of a pneumatic cylinder, two <b>proportional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves,</b> and connective tubing. The dynamics of the individual components were characterized through experimentation. Nonlinear and linear models for the system were validated through the comparison of simulated and experimental data. The models predicted the system behavior more accurately at 2. 5 Hz, when friction effects became negligible, as compared to 1. 0 and 0. 5 Hz. A controller was designed using pole/zero cancellation, a control strategy able to mask undesirable dynamics of the system being controlled. Pole/zero cancellation had superior performance in the attenuation of air compressibility effects in comparison to proportional and proportional-derivative (PD) control. System performance and efficiency were assessed in terms of the variation of the length of tubing connecting the pneumatic cylinder and the <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> Pole/zero cancellation enabled the cylinder to achieve similar levels of performance for long (3. 0 m) tubing as with short (0. 55 m) tubing. With a 1. 0 -Hz sinusoidal input and equal control gains, pole/zero cancellation reduced the tracking error by approximately 30 % and 23 % in comparison to <b>proportional</b> and PD <b>control,</b> respectively. In terms of efficiency, with the system tracking a 2. 5 -Hz sinusoidal command, and using equal control gains, pole/zero cancellation increased the cylinder efficiency by approximately 36 % and 54 % in comparison to <b>proportional</b> and PD <b>control,</b> respectively. In general, pole/zero cancellation increased the system performance and efficiency in comparison to the other control schemes applied...|$|R
