5|$|Himalayan salt is Pakistan's {{best known}} rock salt. It {{is used for}} cooking, as bath salt, as brine and as a raw {{material}} for many industries, including a soda ash plant set up by AkzoNobel in 1940. Salt from Khewra mine {{is also used to}} make decorative items like lamps, vases, ashtrays and statues, which are exported to the United States, India and many European countries. The use of rock salt to make artistic and decorative items started during the Mughal era, when many craftsman made tableware and decorations from it. Warth introduced the use of a lathe to cut out art pieces from the rock salt, as he found it similar to gypsum in <b>physical</b> <b>characteristics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many {{plants have}} {{external}} structural defenses that discourage herbivory. Depending on the herbivore’s <b>physical</b> <b>characteristics</b> (i.e. size and defensive armor), plant structural defenses on stems and leaves can deter, injure, or kill the grazer. Some defensive compounds are produced internally but are released onto the plant’s surface; for example, resins, lignins, silica, and wax cover the epidermis of terrestrial plants and alter {{the texture of}} the plant tissue. The leaves of holly plants, for instance, are very smooth and slippery making feeding difficult. Some plants produce gummosis or sap that traps insects.|$|E

5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on an organism's phenotype, or <b>physical</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Phenotype {{is determined}} by an organism's genetic make-up (genotype) and {{the environment in which}} the organism lives. When different organisms in a population possess different versions of a gene for a certain trait, each of these versions is known as an allele. It is this genetic variation that underlies differences in phenotype. An example is the ABO blood type antigens in humans, where three alleles govern the phenotype.|$|E
5|$|The Appaloosa is an American horse breed {{best known}} for its {{colorful}} spotted coat pattern. There is a wide range of body types within the breed, stemming from the influence of multiple breeds of horses throughout its history. Each horse's color pattern is genetically the result of various spotting patterns overlaid on top of one of several recognized base coat colors. The color pattern of the Appaloosa is of interest to those who study equine coat color genetics, as it and several other <b>physical</b> <b>characteristics</b> are linked to the leopard complex mutation (LP). Appaloosas are prone to develop equine recurrent uveitis and congenital stationary night blindness; the latter has been linked to the leopard complex.|$|E
5|$|The Kerry Bog Pony is a {{mountain}} and moorland breed of pony that originated in Ireland. Possibly {{descended from the}} Irish Hobby horse, it originally lived a mainly feral existence in the peat bogs {{of what is now}} County Kerry in southwestern Ireland. Local inhabitants used the ponies as pack and cart horses for transporting peat and kelp to the villages. The breed developed <b>physical</b> <b>characteristics</b> including a low weight-to-height ratio and an unusual footfall pattern, which helped it move on soft ground such as peat bogs. The ponies were known for hardiness and an ability to survive in harsh conditions.|$|E

5|$|The first {{attempts}} {{to create a}} breed registry in 1903 and 1904 failed. In 1912, another attempt was made, this time successful, and a stud book was created in Dijon in 1913. With {{the creation of the}} stud book, only purebred Auxois or Ardennais and Trait du Nord crosses could be registered. However, by 1917, the <b>physical</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the breed were still not fixed, and leaders of the equine community were critical, and doubtful of whether the Auxois was a breed in its own right or still merely a subtype of the Ardennais. They were also unsure whether {{it was a good idea}} to accept the recognition of another regional breed, of which France had many.|$|E
5|$|The <b>physical</b> <b>characteristics</b> seen in {{the breed}} are {{currently}} in flux, so {{there is not a}} single breed phenotype, though many members of the breed closely resemble the Mérens. Enthusiasts are breeding for a rustic mountain horse, of medium size, with good gaits and good temperament. Some members of the breed closely resemble Iberian horses such as the Andalusian horse. The official breed standard calls for a moderately long neck and long, sloped shoulder, broad back, rounded croup and muscular legs. Some members of the breed are branded on the left hindquarter. Because of its relative rarity and physical similarities, the Castillonnais is commonly confused with the Mérens.|$|E
5|$|The {{rock pigeon}} has been domesticated for {{hundreds}} of years. It has been bred into several varieties kept by hobbyists, of which the best known is the homing pigeon or racing homer.

Domesticated rock pigeons are also bred as carrier pigeons, used {{for thousands of years}} to carry brief written messages, and release doves used in ceremonies. White doves are also commonly used in magic acts.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} assesses streetscapes which {{evoke the}} sense of being in a hot spring locale. The main findings are as follows. 1) To develop the <b>physical</b> <b>characteristic</b> index to assess streetscapes which evoke {{the sense of}} being in a hot spring locale, two factors are identified through a literature review and an interview ((1) a sign of the presence of a hot spring, (2) a sign of people' presence). To assess a sign of hot spring and a sign of people's presence in a streetscape, 4 <b>physical</b> <b>characteristic</b> indices were developed. A <b>physical</b> <b>characteristic</b> index used to assess a sign of the presence of a hot spring is the density of points giving off steam which comes from hot water running along the street. The index of the presence of people is (a) the density of building doorways along the street (The higher the density of building doorways along the street, the higher the score for the presence of people), (b) the width of die street (The narrower the streets, the higher the score for the presence of people) and (c) the ratio of the width of the street and the height of the building (D-H ratio). The lower D-H ratio (narrow street, high building), the higher the score for the presence of people. 2) In a case study, we asked people to rate the streetscapes in Obama hot spring areas, Nagasaki Prefecture, using the <b>physical</b> <b>characteristic</b> indices we developed. Streetscapes which were highly-rated were the older central areas. Based on these findings, we propose a list of considerations for reviewing the management to make full use of streetscapes which evoke {{the sense of being}} in a hot spring locale in Obama hot spring areas...|$|R
