The Fannie Mae laws did not require the Banks to hand out subprime loans in any way. Ginnie Mae had guaranteed the first mortgage <b>passthrough</b> security of an approved lender in 1968 and in 1971 Freddie Mac issued its first mortgage <b>passthrough,</b> called a participation certificate, composed primarily of private mortgages.|$|E

40|$|An {{existing}} space simulation {{facility was}} modified {{to provide the}} required simulated orbital environment for approximately one year of continuous testing of an operating SERT II mercury ion thruster system. Modifications included a frozen mercury collector system operating at cryogenic temperatures and automatic safety features to permit unattended operation. Special high-voltage insulators and <b>passthroughs</b> were designed to ensure electrical and thermal isolation {{in the presence of}} mercury vapor and deposits. The facility performance characteristics which provided the required environment without detrimental effects from mercury during the specialized test are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Before digital television, <b>passthrough</b> {{originally}} {{existed for}} VCRs (and later PVRs and DVDRs), allowing the TV antenna or cable TV signal {{to pass through}} the VCR (with a slight insertion loss) to the TV set automatically when the VCR was turned off, or manually with a button on the remote control. <b>Passthrough</b> was turned off when the RF modulator (typically on TV channel 3 or 4 in North America) was on, as this F connector was originally the only way to send the VCR output to older TVs, until unmodulated composite video and RCA connectors became common.|$|E

50|$|Note that analog <b>passthrough</b> {{signals are}} only {{passed to the}} coax output, not to any other outputs {{provided}} by the unit. While other converter outputs may still be connected and used for digital TV reception, the coaxial RF output must remain connected to pass analog TV signals.|$|E
50|$|If a plan holder {{is using}} his/her Solo 401(k) funds {{to invest in}} an active {{business}} held through a <b>passthrough</b> entity, such as a limited liabilited company or partnership, {{then there is the}} possibility of Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT or UBTI). This is a tax that is levied on tax exempt entities, such as a charity, IRA, or 401(k) Plan, that have invested in an active trade or business unrelated to its exempt purpose. The net profits allocated to the tax-exempt entity from the active trade or business held through a <b>passthrough</b> entity are subject to UBIT on a yearly basis from the business are subject to UBIT on a yearly basis. The UBTI is reported on the IRS Form 990-T. Most investments entered into by retirement plans, however, are not considered active businesses, and therefore are not subject to UBIT.|$|E
50|$|During World War I, {{the fort}} {{was used as}} a {{training}} base and saw over 15,000 recruits <b>passthrough</b> the gates.

50|$|As a {{low-power}} analog television station, WOCH-CA was {{not required}} to broadcast a digital signal as of the 2009 digital television transition. The station had reported, however, that viewers installing coupon-eligible converter boxes were, in some cases, unable to tune into low-powered analog stations such as WOCH-CA after conversion as many models of the digital converters lack analog <b>passthrough.</b>|$|E
