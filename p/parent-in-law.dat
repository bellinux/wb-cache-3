30|$|As IHDS data {{provides}} information on survival of the parents and <b>parents-in-law</b> of married women, we carried out an initial estimation of adult mortality using both sets of information. However, {{we did not observe}} any regular pattern in the estimates based on information about <b>parents-in-law.</b> This may be due to reporting bias on the survival of <b>parents-in-law.</b> We therefore restricted our analysis of adult mortality estimation to a respondent’s biological parents, rather than to her <b>parents-in-law.</b>|$|R

40|$|Clinical commentaries and {{research}} studies {{have described the}} effects of problem gambling on families, but they have usually focused on immediate rather than extended family members. To offset this bias, the present study aimed to develop {{a deeper understanding of}} the various ways in which parents and <b>parents-in-law</b> experience and understand adult children's gambling problems. Thirteen parents and two <b>parents-in-law</b> volunteered to participate in the study. Their experiences and perspectives were explored through in-depth interuiews, emails and telephone discussions. Findings from the study indicate that the repercussions of an adult child's gambling may damage parents and <b>parents-in-law</b> financially, complicate their family relationships and erode their health and wellbeing. Implications for formal service provision are discussed...|$|R

50|$|A <b>parent-in-law</b> is {{a person}} who has a legal {{affinity}} with another by being the parent of the other's spouse. Many cultures and legal systems impose duties and responsibilities on persons connected by this relationship. A person is a son-in-law or daughter-in-law to the parents of the spouse, who are in turn also the parents of those sisters-in-law and brothers-in-law (if any) who are siblings of the spouse (as opposed to spouses of siblings). Together the members of this family affinity group are called the in-laws.|$|E
5000|$|Avoidance {{speech in}} Australian Aboriginal {{languages}} is {{closely tied to}} elaborate tribal kinship systems in which certain relatives are considered taboo. Avoidance relations differ from tribe to tribe in terms of strictness and to whom they apply. Typically, there is an avoidance relationship {{between a man and}} his mother-in-law, usually between a woman and her father-in-law, and sometimes between any person and their <b>parent-in-law</b> of the same sex. For some tribes, avoidance relationships are extended to other family members, such as the mother-in-law's brother in Warlpiri or cross-cousins in Dyirbal. All relations are classificatory - more people may fall into the [...] "mother-in-law" [...] category than just a man's wife's mother.|$|E

50|$|Inheritance {{among the}} Bikpakpaam: Bikpakpaam {{inheritance}} is patrilineal. Every child of Kikpakpaan {{belongs to the}} father’s lineage and will inherit properties of his/her father. The patrilineal inheritance, however, shows great reverence and respect to the maternal relationships, which is mainly seen and used as a second home for the child and also {{as a place of}} asylum in times of patrilineal hostilities. Mothers and children also use the maternal families as a prolific ground for investments. The paternal family pays great homage to the maternal family by plowing one of their fields into farmland every year for free. In addition, the maternal families are entitled to a lavish and honorable <b>parent-in-law</b> funeral sponsored by the paternal family.|$|E
50|$|Portland only: Effective January 1, 2014 all {{employers}} {{with one}} or more employee must comply with Portland's Sick Leave Law. Employees earn one hour of sick leave for every thirty hours after a minimum of 240 hours worked allowing them to earn a maximum of 40 hours of sick time per year. The leave may be unpaid for employers with less than 6 employees but must be paid for employers with 6 or more. Up to 40 unused hours may rollover into the upcoming year. The illness may be of the employee or a qualified family member including spouse, same-sex domestic partner, child, grandparent, grandchild, parent, or <b>parent-in-law.</b> Qualified illnesses need not be substantiated with a doctor's note and if required, all out-of-pocket expenses for the note must be paid by the employer. Rather than pay for the note, an employer may choose to allow employees to sign a statement acknowledging the time out was for a qualified reason. Adverse employment decisions may not be made based upon a request to use sick leave or actual use of the time.|$|E
5000|$|The exact {{meaning of}} [...] "immediate family" [...] varies, and will {{sometimes}} {{be defined in}} legislation or rules for a particular purpose. This can change over time: in 2005 the Scottish Government proposed to change the definition for purposes of compensation payments after deaths. The definition was to be expanded from [...] "a remaining spouse, sexual cohabitant, parent, step-parent or step-child, <b>parent-in-law</b> or child-in-law or any person who was accepted by the deceased as a child of his/her family" [...] to include [...] "any person who had accepted the deceased as {{a child of the}} family, the brother or sister of the deceased, any person brought up in the same household as a child and who was him/herself accepted as a child of the family, the same sex partner of the deceased, or any person who was the grandparent or grandchild of the deceased".In California, for purposes of subdivision of Labor Code Section 2066, [...] "immediate family member" [...] means spouse, domestic partner, cohabitant, child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, grandparent, great grandparent, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, stepsibling, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, or first cousin (that is, a child of an aunt or uncle).|$|E
5000|$|In the vocative, {{relations}} through marriage are not {{distinguished from}} relations through birth/adoption. However, to avoid ambiguity, in the nominative there exist special terms for <b>parents-in-law</b> and children-in-law. It {{is worth noting}} that the terms for a female ego's <b>parents-in-law</b> literally mean [...] "my (parallel) cousin's mother" [...] and [...] "my (parallel) cousin's father", even if one did not marry their cousin; this a relic of the traditional encouragement of parallel cousin marriage.|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to measure}} the causal effect of {{informal}} caregiving on the health and health care use {{of women who are}} caregivers, using instrumental variables. We use data from South Korea, where daughters and daughters‐in‐law are the prevalent source of caregivers for frail elderly parents and parents‐in‐law. A key insight of our instrumental variable approach is that having a <b>parent‐in‐law</b> with functional limitations increases the probability of providing informal care to that <b>parent‐in‐law,</b> but a parent‐in‐law's functional limitation does not directly affect the daughter‐in‐law's health. We compare results for the daughter‐in‐law and daughter samples to check the assumption of the excludability of the instruments for the daughter sample. Our results show that providing informal care has significant adverse effects along multiple dimensions of health for daughter‐in‐law and daughter caregivers in South Korea.

Even in households where the elderly family member is very old or seriously disabled, large proportions of women continue to hold down full- or part-time jobs.

40|$|We employ Chinese {{population}} {{census data}} to consider married, urban women’s labor force participation {{decisions in the}} context of their families. We find that the presence in the household of a parent, <b>parent-in-law,</b> or person aged 75 or older increases prime-age women’s likelihood of participating in market work. The presence of preschool-aged children decreases it. The negative effect on women’s labor force participation of having young children in the household is substantially larger for married, rural-to-urban migrants than for their nonmigrant counterparts. Similarly, the positive effect of coresidence with elders is larger for rural-to-urban migrant women than for nonmigrants. ...|$|E
