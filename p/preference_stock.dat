40|$|Market {{frictions}} make markets incomplete. Firms' {{equity securities}} {{can help to}} complete markets by offering investors opportunities to invest in assets that are otherwise unavailable or costly to acquire. However, stocks offer {{a substitute for the}} underlying assets only if the firm maintains exposure to the assets. In incomplete markets, investors should display <b>preferences</b> for <b>stocks</b> with high industry exposure, especially when the costs of direct investment in the industry assets are high. We provide evidence that investors display <b>preferences</b> for <b>stocks</b> with high industry exposure based on a robust positive relation between investor interest (turnover, and the number of institutions and mutual funds) and industry exposure. The association is unrelated to levels of diversification. The attraction to industry exposure is greatest in industries in which returns differ significantly from those of the aggregate market portfolio, where the benefits from investing in industry exposed stocks as substitutes for the underlying assets are the greatest. Preferences for industry exposure are most pronounced for transient investors investing based on public information, and sector funds seeking industry exposure. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1858 the Brogdens {{approached}} the Furness Railway {{for a further}} loan as traffic on the U&L had not “come up to expectations”. However the FR insisted that they would only offer a loan if the U&L was sold to them so Brogdens declined this offer. In 1859-1860 the line began to pay its way. It was rumoured that the line would be sold to the London and North Western Railway and in 1862 an agreement was made between the shareholders of the U&L and Furness. U&L shareholders received 5% <b>preference</b> <b>stock</b> in the Furness Railway {{in return for their}} U&L shares, not a very large return considering that they had risked losing the money altogether.

50|$|The East Somerset Railway was not {{a success}} in {{financial}} terms, {{and after a few}} years the possibility of a sale to the wealthy Great Western Railway was being considered. The East Somerset valued its line at £87,138, but the GWR was unwilling to pay that price for an unsuccessful railway. The GWR was planning to convert the gauge of the former Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth line to standard gauge, and gave notice to the East Somerset in January 1874 that it would do so in May. The ESR directors could hardly have been surprised at this development, but it meant that they too would have to convert the gauge of their line. The cost of that would be £7,390, money that they did not have. The ESR now had no alternative to selling to the GWR, which they did for GWR <b>preference</b> <b>stock</b> valued at £67,442.

50|$|For a decade, {{there had}} been talk of the Sirhowy Railway being {{acquired}} {{by one of the}} neighbouring concerns. In November 1873 the Monmouthshire Railway approached the Sirhowy with an offer to buy their concern for £295,000. Negotiations continued in 1874, and then it appeared certain that the Great Western Railway would conclude a deal. The GWR promoted a Parliamentary Bill in the 1875 session for a new line connecting Nine Mile Point and Caerleon, so by-passing Newport, which was heavily congested at the time. In fact it was the LNWR which started working trains over the Sirhowy line from 1 July 1875, and on 21 August 1875 a working agreement was concluded; this was enabled by a general clause on the Sirhowy Company’s Act of 1865. Sirhowy Company debentures to the extent of £56,633 were taken on by the LNWR, and Sirhowy ordinary and <b>preference</b> <b>stock</b> was exchanged for an equivalent amount of LNWR interest bearing stock. All this was ratified by the London and North Western Railway (Sirhowy Railway Vesting) Act of 13 July 1876.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} use of earnings, forward-looking {{performance}} measures and stock prices in managerial compensation. When the firm's owner and its manager have identical time <b>preferences,</b> the <b>stock</b> price is not useful for motivating the manager, {{as it is a}} noisy aggregation of a forward-looking measure and future earnings. In contrast, when the owner and the manager have conflicting time <b>preferences,</b> the noisy <b>stock</b> price is useful for contracting. If the manager has no access to banking and cannot trade the firm's shares, the timeliness of the stock price dominates the extra risk imposed by its noise. At the same time, forward-looking performance measures (such as customer satisfaction) can induce a desirable allocation of management effort between the short term and long term more efficiently than the stock price can. Forward-looking performance measures and the stock price are thus not direct substitutes in rewarding farsighted effort. ...|$|R

40|$|Using a new unique {{data set}} on mutual fund stockholdings, we {{identify}} several interesting {{similarities and differences}} in the <b>stock</b> <b>preferences</b> of domestic and foreign fund managers from 11 developed countries. Results show that both groups of managers prefer stocks with high return on equity, large turnover, and low return variability, and that they also exhibit differential investment behavior. Domestic managers also favor firms that pay large dividends, have low financial distress and high growth potential, whereas foreign managers prefer to invest in corporations that are globally well known. The demand for globally visible stocks by foreign managers is especially strong when their fund mandate is to diversify globally or across regions, and is weakened when their stock holdings are concentrated mainly in a specific local market. The results also show {{no difference in the}} <b>stock</b> <b>preferences</b> of American-, European- and Asian-based funds.

The Local Home Bias is absent in non-family firms or in family firms where the owner has acquired control through a market transaction.

The Maryport and Carlisle Railway would have welcomed the branch if it had gone no further than a junction with the M&C at Leegate, but regarded its continuation to Mealsgate as an invasion of their territory, and accordingly opposed the Bill, offering to introduce a Bill of their own in the next parliamentary session for a loop off the M&C main line to serve the Mealsgate collieries. At the committee hearing on the Silloth company's Bill, counsel for the company admitted it was insolvent, {{and the secretary of}} the company said that 'it was no secret' that borrowings had exceeded that authorised by parliament, and that thousands of pounds had been spent at Silloth on streets, sewerage, gasworks, hotel, and baths - all things helping the formation of a seaside resort, but none of them things on which expenditure was authorised by the company's Act of Incorporation. Without hearing witnesses opposed to the branch, the committee rejected the bill. Cross-examination of company witnesses had been used to explore the extent to which Silloth directors had persistently used their personal wealth to circumvent the requirements and limits of the company's Act, and the Carlisle Patriot, feeling amply justified, commented that the evidence [...] "disclosed such a state of reckless management and pecuniary insolvency that we may assume the Committee deemed it high time to stop the parties from adding to their misfortunes and difficulties"; [...] "it shows the exact position in which the Company, or rather, the Directors and Manager of the company, now stand with reference to the shareholders, the creditors, and the public.
