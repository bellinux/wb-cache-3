5|$|The {{estimated}} {{prevalence of}} active epilepsy (as of 2012) {{is in the}} range 3–10 per 1,000, with active epilepsy defined as someone with epilepsy {{who has had a}} least one unprovoked seizure in the last five years. Epilepsy begins each year in 40–70 per 100,000 in developed countries and 80–140 per 100,000 in developing countries. Poverty is a risk and includes both being from a <b>poor</b> <b>country</b> and being poor relative to others within one's country. In the developed world epilepsy most commonly starts either in the young or in the old. In the developing world its onset is more common in older children and young adults due to the higher rates of trauma and infectious diseases. In developed countries the number of cases a year has decreased in children and increased among the elderly between the 1970s and 2003. This has been attributed partly to better survival following strokes in the elderly.|$|E

50|$|The Bhagwati-Kravis-Lipsey view {{provides}} {{a somewhat different}} explanation from the Balassa-Samuelson theory.

30|$|Going {{back to the}} {{individual}} data, when splitting {{the individual}} data by rich and <b>poor</b> <b>countries,</b> {{we also found that}} individual desire to emigrate is more sensitive to SWB in rich <b>countries</b> than in <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> (Figure  1 A and Models 4 – 9 in Table  2). This is consistent with the earlier result when estimating Equation (1) separately for each country in Figure  3 A, that SWB is not significantly associated with migration desire in some <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> – although 87.0 % of <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> have negative relationship between migration desire and SWB, only 55.1 % of <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> have a significant and negative relationship (at the 5 % significance level). Interestingly, another result from the cross-country analysis – <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> have a stronger effect of GDP per capita on national average desire to emigrate – could not be replicated when individual data is analyzed. Instead, we found that household income has a less significant relationship with the desire to emigrate in <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> than in rich countries (Table  2). One explanation might be that some rich people in <b>poor</b> <b>countries,</b> unsatisfied that they are staying in a poor society, desire to emigrate as much as poor people. On the other hand, poor people in <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> might be trapped in places where they have insufficient resources to move (Foresight 2011), which may even diminish their migration desires. Besides, a survey conducted in <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> might yield less accurate income data. These factors may weaken the effect of household income on the desire to emigrate in <b>poor</b> <b>countries.</b> When the country-level data are used, since there is no within-country variation, we are able to identify a strong effect of income on the national migration desire for <b>poor</b> <b>countries.</b>|$|R

A Federal cavalry force of about 2,000 men from Pine Bluff, Arkansas was supposed to keep watch on the Confederate garrison at Camden, divert attention from Steele’s movement and eventually to join up with Steele. Even though Steele was three weeks behind schedule, he did not find Thayer at Arkadelphia when his forces arrived there on March 29, 1864.

25|$|In {{sites such}} as Angkor, tourism is inevitable. Therefore, the site {{management}} team cannot exclusively manage the site. The team has to manage the flow of people.

The sandstone monuments and Angkor are not made {{for this type of}} heightened tourism. Moving forward, UNESCO and local authorities at the site {{are in the process of}} creating a sustainable plan for the future of the site. Since 1992, UNESCO has moved towards conserving Angkor. Thousands of new archaeological sites have been discovered by UNESCO, and the organization has moved towards protected cultural zones. Two decades later, over 1000 people are employed full-time at the site for cultural sensitivity reasons. Part of this movement to limit the impacts of tourism has been to only open certain areas of the site. However, much of the 1992 precautionary measures and calls for future enforcement have fallen through. Both globally and locally the policy-making has been successful, but the implementation has failed for several reasons. First, there are conflicts of interest in Cambodia. While the site is culturally important to them, Cambodia is a <b>poor</b> <b>country.</b> Its GDP is marginally larger than Afghanistan’s. Tourism is a vital part to the Cambodian economy, and shutting down parts of Angkor, the largest tourist destination in the country, is not an option. A second reason stems from the government’s inability to organize around the site. The Cambodian government has failed in organizing a robust team of cultural specialists and archaeologists to service the site.|$|E

25|$|Reflecting the new pro-German {{foreign policy}} on 25 October 1936, Mussolini agreed {{to form a}} Rome-Berlin Axis, sanctioned by a {{cooperation}} agreement with Nazi Germany and signed in Berlin. Furthermore, the conquest of Ethiopia cost the lives of 12,000 Italians and another 4,000 to 5,000 Libyans, Eritreans, and Somalis fighting in Italian service. Mussolini believed that conquering Ethiopia would cost 4 to 6 billion lire, but the true costs of the invasion proved to be 33.5 billion lire. The economic costs of the conquest {{proved to be a}} staggering blow to the Italian budget, and seriously retarded Italian efforts at military modernization as the money that Mussolini had earmarked for military modernization was instead spent in conquering Ethiopia, something that helped to drive Mussolini towards Germany. To help cover the huge debts run up during the Ethiopian war, Mussolini devalued the lire by 40% in October 1936. Furthermore, the costs of occupying Ethiopia was to cost the Italian treasury another 21.1 billion lire between 1936–1940. Additionally, Italy was to lose 4,000 men killed fighting in the Spanish Civil War (a number adjusted to Italy's population was proportionally twice the American losses in Vietnam) while Italian intervention in Spain cost Italy another 12 to 14 billion lire. In the years 1938 and 1939, the Italian government took in 39.9 billion lire in taxes while the entire Italian gross national product was 153 billion lire, which meant the Ethiopian and Spanish wars imposed economically crippling costs on Italy. Only 28% of the entire military Italian budgets between 1934–39 was spent on military modernization with the rest all being consumed by Mussolini's wars, which led to a rapid decline in Italian military power. By contrast, reflecting the far larger size of the German economy, the total Italian military expenditure in 1936 was equal to only 27% of the total German military expenditure for 1936. The much greater size of the German economy allowed Hitler to both modernize the Wehrmacht and intervene in the Spanish Civil War at the same time, an option that Mussolini did not have. Between 1935–39, Mussolini's wars cost Italy the equivalent of $500 US billion dollars in 1999 values, a sum that was even proportionally a larger burden given that Italy was such a <b>poor</b> <b>country.</b> The 1930s were a time of rapid advances in military technology, and Sullivan wrote that Mussolini picked exactly the wrong time to fight his wars in Ethiopia and Spain. At {{the same time that the}} Italian military was falling behind the other great powers, a full scale arms race had broken out, with Germany, Britain and France spending increasingly large sums of money on their militaries as the 1930s advanced, a situation that Mussolini privately admitted seriously limited Italy's ability to fight a major war on its own, and thus required a great power ally to compensate for increasing Italian military backwardness.|$|E
