The library was the first unconditionally free public library in the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorial}} {{was unveiled}} {{at a ceremony}} on 26 June 1921. It cost £400 to build, which was raised by <b>public</b> <b>subscription.</b> The unveiling was performed by Brigadier-General Arthur Asquith, brother of Raymond Asquith, who is commemorated on the memorial.

5|$|A disused quarry at East Kirkton in the Bathgate Hills is the {{location}} where the Carboniferous fossil of Westlothiana lizziae (aka 'Lizzie') {{was found in}} 1984. This lizard {{is one of the}} earliest known ancestors of the reptiles. The specimen was purchased in part by <b>public</b> <b>subscription</b> and is now on display in the National Museum of Scotland. The site was originally discovered in the early 19th century and has also provided fossil eurypterids, sharks and a variety of primitive acanthodian fish.|$|E
50|$|It {{appears that}} money was still tight and the {{required}} funds were not readily available. The governing Committee examined a number of funding methods including <b>public</b> <b>subscriptions</b> and a lottery; {{a combination of a}} lottery and <b>public</b> <b>subscriptions</b> were considered the best means of raising funds.|$|R

50|$|Funds for the {{erection}} of {{the memorial}} {{were raised by}} <b>public</b> <b>subscriptions</b> and functions arranged by a public committee.|$|R
5|$|Although {{work had}} begun on the Millfields station, {{including}} {{the completion of}} the station hotel (now the Unicorn pub), the population of Chesham were unhappy at the station being built such a distance from the town. With the extension to meet the LNWR abandoned the railway no longer needed to curve away from the town, and a <b>public</b> <b>subscription</b> raised £2,000 fund a 71-chain (1,562-yd; 1,428m) extension to a site near the town centre. Construction of the branch to Chesham began in late 1887.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{findings}} of Rae and Anderson, the Admiralty did not plan another search of its own. Britain officially labelled the crew deceased in service on 31 March 1854. Lady Franklin, failing to convince the government to fund another search, personally commissioned one more expedition under Francis Leopold McClintock. The expedition ship, the steam schooner Fox, bought via <b>public</b> <b>subscription,</b> sailed from Aberdeen on 2 July 1857.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Mason {{died three}} days after his 69th {{birthday}} on 2February 1886 at his home, Groby Hall. At his death, he had amassed a fortune worth £290,933 (now worth about £17M). He {{was the first person}} to have a statue (now protected as a Grade II listed building) erected in his honour in Tameside; it was financed by <b>public</b> <b>subscription</b> immediately after Mason's death.|$|E
50|$|Byrnes is commemorated by two statues, one in Centenary Place in Brisbane and the heritage-listed T J Byrnes Monument in Warwick, both {{funded by}} <b>public</b> <b>subscriptions.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1913 William Champion, and Lord Dysart, {{operators}} {{of the nearby}} Twickenham Ferry, took legal action against Hammerton to remove his right to operate the ferry. Although Hammerton won the initial case, the judgement was reversed on appeal. Following considerable public interest in the case, a <b>public</b> <b>subscription</b> raised the funds for Hammerton {{to take the case}} to the House of Lords, who ruled in his favour on 23 July 1915.|$|E
5|$|In September 1919, the Spalding War and Victory Memorials Committee {{was formed}} to oversee {{fundraising}} and construction of the memorial, {{the total cost of}} which was £3,500. McLaren and her father-in-law Charles McLaren, 1st Baron Aberconway contributed £1,000 each, Sir Herbert and Dame Agnes Jekyll donated £100, Henry McLaren (Barbara's brother-in-law) donated the stone flags, and the remainder was raised by <b>public</b> <b>subscription,</b> which took until 1922.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's {{body was}} transported back to Sydney by train, which also carried the Australia and England teams {{for the next}} Test. Thousands of mourners lined the streets of Sydney for his funeral and the pallbearers were Woodfull, Ponsford, McCabe, Bert Oldfield, Vic Richardson and Bradman. He was buried at the Field of Mars {{cemetery}} and a <b>public</b> <b>subscription</b> was raised to install a headstone on his gravesite. The headstone, reading simply He played the game, was unveiled by the Premier of New South Wales Bertram Stevens.|$|E
5000|$|The {{memorial}} {{was funded}} by <b>public</b> <b>subscriptions</b> at an establishment cost of about £110. The mason was F Williams & Co of Ipswich, who was also responsible for the memorials at: ...|$|R
25|$|In 1844 the Nelson Memorial Committee {{ran out of}} money, {{having only}} raised £20,485 in <b>public</b> <b>subscriptions,</b> and the Government, {{in the form of}} the Office of Woods and Forests took over the project.|$|R
50|$|The lottery raised 89 354 baht and <b>public</b> <b>subscriptions</b> 40 000 baht {{allowing}} the Nursing Home to buy land {{for its new}} building which opened thirty years after {{the founding of the}} original hospital.|$|R
5|$|On 26 May 2000, the Enigma Fountain, also by Garrard, was {{unveiled}} by The Duke of York. Its cost of £5,000 {{was funded by}} the Malvern Hills District Council, <b>public</b> <b>subscription,</b> and support from by Severn Trent Water, West Midlands Arts, and local businesses. Located on the Bellevue Terrace island in the very centre of the town, together with the statue of Edward Elgar, the group of sculptures embodies both music and water, the two major aspects of Malvern's cultural history.|$|E
5|$|Shaw is commemorated in Kilmarnock {{town centre}} by {{a statue of}} Carrara marble, about 17 feet tall, on a base of Aberdeen granite, {{executed}} by sculptor James Fillans (1808–52). The cost was defrayed by <b>public</b> <b>subscription,</b> which raised almost £1000. It was unveiled on 4 August 1848 and was originally located at the Kilmarnock Cross. On 28 March 1929 the statue {{was moved to the}} area of The Dick Institute just off the London Road because of the increase in traffic around the centre of the town.|$|E
5|$|The 19th century saw major {{development}} in healthcare in Arbroath. In 1836 a dispensary {{was set up}} by <b>public</b> <b>subscription</b> to provide medical care for the poor. In 1842 a typhus epidemic in the town {{led to the creation of}} a small fever ward to keep patients in isolation. The following year subscriptions began to be taken to develop this into Arbroath Infirmary, which opened in 1845, and moved to new premises in 1916.|$|E
50|$|In 1807 Ralph Dodd opened <b>public</b> <b>subscriptions</b> for {{transferable}} {{shares to}} raise capital of £100,000, divided into 2000 shares of £50 each, for the Intended London Distillery Company Ltd, to manufacture Genuine British Spirits and Compounds.|$|R
50|$|The Po Leung Kuk {{homes in}} Singapore, Malacca and Penang were {{controlled}} by committees of Chinese gentlemen, and financed by endowment funds raised from <b>public</b> <b>subscriptions.</b> The Penang Cheshire Home {{was set up}} in 1978, in a wing of the former Penang Po Leung Kuk Home.|$|R
50|$|The {{funds were}} allowed to accrue interest. Philippe Ménard, {{executor}} of Gastigny's estate, solicited for additional funds through <b>public</b> <b>subscriptions</b> for the hospital, known as La Providence. The hospital opened in 1718 by Royal Charter, with Henri de Massue, Earl of Galway serving as its first governor.|$|R
5|$|The city's first hospital, York County Hospital, {{opened in}} 1740 in Monkgate funded by <b>public</b> <b>subscription.</b> It closed in 1976 {{when it was}} {{replaced}} by York Hospital, which opened the same year and gained Foundation status in April 2007. It has 524 adult inpatient beds and 127 special purpose beds providing general healthcare and some specialist inpatient, daycase and outpatient services. It {{is also known as}} York District Hospital and YDH.|$|E
5|$|A {{soup kitchen}} {{was built in}} 1880, {{replacing}} the police station which adjoined the hospital on the west side, by <b>public</b> <b>subscription</b> and dispensed soup to the ‘deserving poor’ until 1891. The soup was not free: it cost half a pence per pint. People who had donated each {{had a number of}} tickets which they could give to those people who they believed qualified for the ration. The deserving poor in Victorian times were those unable to work during the winter months. Those individuals classed as undeserving were those whose poverty was deemed to be caused by indolence and alcoholism.|$|E
5|$|Although the College {{building}} was saved from the war, its walls and roof {{were left in}} a perilous state. In 1954 a decision was forced upon heralds, whether to abandon the old building (which would have been profitable financially) or repair it on a scale far beyond the College's resources. Eventually {{with the help of}} the Ministry of Works and a <b>public</b> <b>subscription,</b> the {{building was}} repaired in time for the College's 4th centenary of being in possession of Derby Place. The present gates to the building were added in 1956, and came originally from Goodrich Court in Herefordshire. The new gates displayed the College's arms and crest.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{it still}} {{continues}} to be supported through <b>public</b> <b>subscriptions</b> and its own fund raising efforts. Its amateur members traditionally pride themselves on being financially independent, never having been beholden to any commercial interest, yet they are still {{regarded as one of}} the ‘elite’ on the contest and concert platforms.|$|R
5000|$|The {{explorer}} William John Wills of Burke and Wills expedition fame {{was born}} in Totnes. A memorial to Wills was erected using money from <b>public</b> <b>subscriptions</b> in 1864. It can still {{be seen on the}} Plains. There were originally two gas lamps attached to the monument, but both have since been removed.|$|R
50|$|The Clarkson Memorial cost £2,035, and {{was paid}} for {{primarily}} by a large donation from the Peckover family, local Quaker philanthropists. The shortfall was made up by <b>public</b> <b>subscriptions.</b> Work started on 28 October 1880 and the statue was unveiled on 11 November 1881 by Sir Henry Brand, speaker of the House of Commons and MP for Cambridgeshire.|$|R
5|$|In {{between these}} campaigns Rupert had visited his uncle's court in England. The Palatinate cause {{was a popular}} Protestant issue in England, and in 1637 a general <b>public</b> <b>subscription</b> helped fund an {{expedition}} under Charles Louis to try and regain the electorate {{as part of a}} joint French campaign. Rupert was placed in command of a Palatinate cavalry regiment, and his later friend Lord Craven, an admirer of Rupert's mother, assisted in raising funds and accompanied the army on the campaign. The campaign ended badly at the Battle of Vlotho (17 October 1638) during the invasion of Westphalia; Rupert escaped death, but was captured by the forces of the Imperial General Melchior von Hatzfeldt {{towards the end of the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|The Kirk {{began to}} concern itself with {{providing}} {{churches in the}} new towns and relatively thinly supplied Highlands, establishing a church extension committee in 1828. Led by Thomas Chalmers, by the early 1840s it had added 222 churches, largely through <b>public</b> <b>subscription.</b> When the Great Disruption occurred in 1843, and roughly a third of ministers and their congregations left the established church and its buildings to form the Free Church of Scotland, Chalmers' organisational skills helped the Free Church build over 700 new places of worship by 1847. The established church took time to recover, but embarked on a rival programme of church building, increasing its number of parishes from 924 in 1843 to 1,437 by 1909. The intense competition between different denominations {{led to the creation}} of grand churches with tall steeples and ultimately resulted in an oversupply of churches, which would be a financial burden to future generations.|$|E
5|$|The war {{interrupted}} Headley's career; {{although he}} returned to Tests in 1948 he was hampered by injuries and did not achieve his previous levels of success. Even so, he was chosen as West Indies captain in 1948 against England, the first black player to be appointed to the position, although a combination of injuries and politics meant he only led his team for one Test match. He did not play Tests between 1949 and 1953, but resumed his career in English league cricket, first in Lancashire {{and later in the}} Birmingham League. His playing career ended in 1954 on his return to Jamaica, after a <b>public</b> <b>subscription</b> paid his fare from England. After retiring as a player, Headley was employed as a cricket coach by the Jamaican government until 1962. He lived until 1983; his son Ron and his grandson Dean each played Test match cricket, for West Indies and England respectively.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Alva Academy {{was established}} in the 1860s by <b>public</b> <b>subscriptions</b> from residents of the town to overcome the shortcomings of educational provision. Educational change and a constantly rising school roll forced regular change to meet growing demands. The advent of comprehensive education in 1967/68 saw the linking of Tillicoultry and Alva Schools into a six-year comprehensive.|$|R
50|$|William Tennant, Lord of the Manor of Shenstone, {{gave the}} {{land on which}} the church is {{situated}} along with £100 towards {{the construction of the}} building. Robert Peel of Tamhorn gave a further £60. A total of £623/19s/0d was raised from <b>public</b> <b>subscriptions.</b> John Mellor took on the role as clerk of works as building began.|$|R
5000|$|The {{structure}} was built using <b>public</b> <b>subscriptions,</b> raised by its architect and promoter Stephen Geary. He exhibited {{a model of}} [...] "the Kings Cross" [...] at the Royal Academy in 1830. The project was originally intended to be called [...] "St George's Cross". The amount raised was disappointingly low, and the {{structure was}} correspondingly less impressive than intended.|$|R
