40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} surface structure and crystal growth and morphology of fenoxycarb (FC). Experimental vs. predicted morphologies/face indices of fenoxycarb crystals are presented. Atomic-scale surface structures of the crystalline particles, derived from experimentally-indexed single crystals, are also modelled. Single crystals of fenoxycarb exhibit a platelet-like morphology which closely matches predicted morphologies. The solvent choice does not significantly influence either morphology or crystal habit. The crystal morphology {{is dominated by the}} { 001 } faces, featuring weakly interacting aliphatic or aromatic groups at their surfaces. Two distinct modes of interaction of a FC molecule in the crystal can be observed, which appear to be principal factors governing the microscopic shape of the crystal: the relatively strong collateral and the much weaker <b>perpendicular</b> <b>bonding.</b> Both forcefield-based and quantum-chemical calculations predict that the aromatic and aliphatic terminated { 001 } faces have comparably high stability as a consequence of weak intermolecular bonding. Thus we predict that the most developed { 001 } surfaces of fenoxycarb crystals should be terminated randomly, favouring neither aliphatic nor aromatic termination. Acceptedpeer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Resonance Raman {{spectra of}} the MnII-NO moiety in {{synthetic}} nitrosyl manganese heme complexes {{with and without}} steric hindrance are reported. The "strapped" hemes having a hydrocarbon strap (variable length) across one face of the heme hinder the <b>perpendicular</b> <b>bonding</b> of a linear ligand. These complexes were employed to investigate the effects of ligand distortion (primarily tilting) on Mn-NO stretching, Mn-N-O bending, and N-O stretching modes. It is demonstrated that ligand distortion in the MnII-NO system is a valid mechanism for causing the resonance enhancement of the Mn-N-O bending mode, similar to that observed in the FeII-CO system (Yu, N. -T., E. A. Kerr, B. Ward, and C. K. Chang. 1983. Biochemistry. 22 : 4534 – 4540). More interesting is the observation of the delta(Mn-N-O) enhancement caused by the tilting of the trans Mn-N epsilon bond in the "open" heme complexes (e. g., heme- 5 and proto- 1 X dimethylester) with 1, 2 -dimethylimidazole or piperidine as a base. The nu(Mn-NO) and nu(N-O) modes exhibit an increase and a decrease, respectively, as the strap length decreases (hence the steric hindrance increases). Both nu(Mn-NO) and nu(N-O) frequencies are insensitive {{to the strength of}} the trans base. The results from "strapped" and "open" model heme systems imply that the Mn-N-O geometry is essentially linear and perpendicular in the nitrosyl complexes of monomeric manganese insect hemoglobin CTT IV and sperm whale myoglobin. The unusually low nu(N-O) frequency in the manganese myoglobin complex may be caused by the distal histidine-NO interaction. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E

Regenerated cellulose fibres, rayon, were used. They were carboxymethylated in order to introduce charges to the fibres. Two different treatments were used to prepare fibres with charges located {{on the surface of}} the fibres and charges located throughout the bulk of the fibres. The charge characteristics, with respect to total charge and surface charge of the fibre were determined. The swelling caused by these charges was analysed with respect to pore volume distribution (NMR measurements) and water retention capacity (WRV). Charge characterisation showed that surface charged fibres could be produced by pre-drying fibres prior to carboxymethylation. Furthermore, WRV and NMR-relaxation measurements showed that an increase in the surface charge had no significant influence on the swelling whereas an increase in bulk charges had a large effect. The strength of the joints and the paper tensile properties are most affected by the surface charges, probably due to an increase in the molecular contact area with increasing charge.

We derive a general condition for the appearance and disappearance of the Floquet edge modes as a function of the drive frequency for a generic d-dimensional integrable system. We confirm this general condition for the Kitaev model with a finite width by mapping it to a one-dimensional model. Our numerical and analytical study of this problem shows that Floquet Majorana modes can appear on some edges in the kicked system even when the corresponding equilibrium Hamiltonian has no Majorana mode solutions on those edges. We support our analytical studies by numerics for a finite sized system which show that periodic kicks can generate modes at the edges and the corners of the lattice...|$|R
40|$|Our {{previously}} developed polarizable electrostatic {{model is}} applied to isolated N-methylacetamide (NMA) and to three hydrogen-bonded configurations of the NMA dimer. Two versions of the model are studied. In the first one (POL 1), polarizability along the valence bonds is described by induced bond charge increments, and polarizability <b>perpendicular</b> to the <b>bonds</b> is described by cylindrically isotropic induced atomic dipoles. In the other version (POL 2), the induced bond charge increments are replaced by induced atomic dipoles along the bonds. The parameterization is done by fitting to ab initio MP 2 / 6 - 31 ++G(d,p) electric potentials. The polarizability parameters are determined by subjecting the NMA molecule to various external electric fields. POL 1 {{turns out to be}} easier to optimize than POL 2. Both models reproduce well the ab initio electric potentials, molecular dipole moments, and molecular polarizability tensors of the monomer and the dimers. Nonpolarizable models are also investigated. The results show that polarization is very important for reproducing the electric potentials of the studied dimers, indicating that this is also the case in hydrogen bonding between peptide groups in proteins. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
