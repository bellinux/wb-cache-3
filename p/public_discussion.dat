5|$|A major {{turning point}} for the {{movement}} came during World War I, when many U.S. servicemen were diagnosed with venereal diseases. The government's response included an anti-venereal disease campaign that framed sexual intercourse and contraception as issues {{of public health and}} legitimate topics of scientific research. This was the first time a U.S. government institution had engaged in a sustained, <b>public</b> <b>discussion</b> of sexual matters; as a consequence, contraception transformed from an issue of morals to an issue of public health.|$|E

5|$|An {{incident}} in Žirmūnai's history {{that has been}} difficult to reconstruct occurred in 1975, when a pontoon bridge across the River Neris, that was customarily set up from spring to autumn, collapsed due to the weight of a crowd returning from a concert in the Palace of Concerts and Sports.

The pontoon bridge was never re-erected at the site; the Mindaugas Bridge now serves this need.|$|E

5|$|Since the Middle Ages, {{both the}} Stjørdalen and Verdal valleys were {{important}} trade routes connecting Trøndelag and Jämtland. In particular, Levanger grew into an important trading town for Jämtland farmers, who would travel across the Verdal Mountains. The first <b>public</b> <b>discussion</b> of a railway {{was launched in}} Levanger in 1858; the initiative was pushed by Jämtland's governor Thome, who proposed a line via Verdal to Levanger. At the time, the Trondhjem–Støren Line {{was about to be}} built, and the commercial interests in Trondheim were more concerned with a southward connection along what would become the Røros Line to Oslo. A 1869 meeting in Sundsvall, Sweden, had proposed three routes for the line: via Verdal, via Meråker or as a branch from Røros.|$|E

Initially, he was unrepentant, but in 2004 he admitted to the BBC that he regretted burning the money.|$|E
5|$|This {{incident}} {{sparked a}} major <b>public</b> <b>discussion</b> on station safety and security, mainly because {{the station was}} unstaffed when the suspects mugged Ali on the platform. The only security present was CCTV cameras, and the ticket barriers were left open allowing the suspects to enter the station freely. Many high-profile politicians spoke {{on the issue of}} station safety and called on rail companies to provide security or staff the station until the last train had left the station. The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone assailed Silverlink, the train company who managed the station, for not providing all-night staffing or security. The new provider of every franchise across the rail network will have to provide staff at all times the station is open.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} Oslo Airport {{location}} controversy, {{after the}} new airport was decided located to Gardermoen, there was a <b>public</b> <b>discussion</b> {{as to what to}} do with the general aviation which had operated from Fornebu. While some local aircraft owners wanted to keep a small part of Fornebu for general aviation, the authorities decided to close the airport completely. Instead, the general aviation was distributed to various private airports in Eastern Norway, including Notodden. In May 1998, Air Team started flights from Notodden to Bergen. Air Team gradually moved all its operations, including its pilot school, to Notodden. After Fornebu was closed in October, the airline experienced a quadrupling of patronage, as Gardermoen had given longer travel time for people in Buskerud and Telemark. In addition to business travel, the airline catered offshore workers commuting to the North Sea via Bergen. The airline stated that it intended to also open routes to Stavanger and Copenhagen.|$|E
