The company had an initial share capital of NOK10 million and established its head office and main base at Stavanger Airport, Sola. Separate companies, organized as kommandittselskap, wer established to own each aircraft and lease them to the airline. The aircraft owner companies paid 28.7 million United States dollars for each Boeing 737-300, which were delivered new from Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Shares in the aircraft owning companies was offered to the public with a four-percent annual return on investment. Part of the investment model was based on tax advantages.|$|E

5|$|Government {{policies}} shifted dramatically after 1965, {{becoming more}} favorable to economic expansion. In {{an effort to}} rehabilitate the economy, the government turned to those who possessed the capability to invest and expand corporate activity. Ethnic Chinese capitalists, called the , were supported by the military, which emerged as the dominant political force after 1965. Indigenous businessmen once again demanded greater investment support from {{the government in the}} 1970s, but legislative efforts failed to reduce ethnic Chinese dominance. In a 1995 study published by the East Asia Analytical Unit of Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, approximately 73 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> capitalization value of publicly listed companies (excluding foreign and state-owned companies) were owned by Chinese Indonesians. Additionally, they owned 68 percent of the top 300 conglomerates and nine of the top ten private sector groups at the end of 1993. This figure propagated the general belief that ethnic Chinese—then estimated at 3 percent of the population—controlled 70 percent of the economy. Although the accuracy of this figure was disputed, it was evident that a wealth disparity existed along ethnic boundaries. The image of an economically powerful ethnic Chinese community was further fostered by the government through its inability to dissociate itself from the patronage networks. The Hokchia group dominated the ethnic Chinese business scene during the Suharto government, although other groups emerged after 1998.|$|E

25|$|Internet {{access in}} an act of {{unprecedented}} Internet censorship. About 3,500 Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routes to Egyptian networks were shut down from about 12:10am to 12:35am 28 January. The shutdown happened within the space of a few tens of minutes, not instantaneously. According to Renesys, Telecom Egypt started shutting down at 12:12am, Raya/Vodafone at 12:13am, Link Egypt at 12:17am, Etisalat Misr at 12:19am, and Internet Egypt at 12:25am. Renesys interpreted the shutdown as people getting phone calls one at a time, telling them to take themselves off the air, rather than an automated system taking all providers down at once. Facebook confirmed a decrease in traffic from Egypt. A Border Gateway Protocol monitoring site in Vancouver, Canada, reported most of the primary AS (ISPs) dropping a large percentage if not all of route advertisements. Virtually all of Egypt's Internet addresses were unreachable, worldwide. In response, Egyptians used smartphones as modems, and even land lines with dial-up modems to make international calls to access the internet, fax machines in universities and embassies, and ham radio to circumvent the restrictions. Furthermore, the sole remaining functioning ISP, Noor, which had had eight <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> share in Egypt (but which connected the Egyptian stock market and many western companies to the outside world), has been reported by Tor, an anonymity network, on 30 January to be the source of a quadrupling of Tor clients from Egypt within twenty-four hours as of 30 January; the use of Tor has skyrocketed due to the situation in Egypt.|$|E

2500|$|Between 1940 and 1948, {{domestic}} {{steam locomotive}} sales declined from 30 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> to 2 percent. By 1949, {{there was no}} demand for steam locomotives. Baldwin's attempts {{to adapt to the}} changed market for road locomotives had been unsuccessful; the reliability of their offerings was unsatisfactory, epitomized by notorious failures such as their [...] "Centipede" [...] Diesel locomotives and their steam turbine-electric locomotives, which proved to be money pits unsuited for their intended service. [...] In July 1948 Westinghouse Electric, which had teamed with Baldwin to build diesel and electric locomotives and wanted to keep their main customer in the rail industry afloat, purchased 500,000 shares, or 21 percent, of Baldwin stock, which made Westinghouse Baldwin's largest shareholder. Baldwin used the money to cover various debts. Westinghouse vice president Marvin W. Smith became Baldwin's president in May 1949. In a move to diversify into the construction equipment market, Baldwin merged with Lima-Hamilton on December 4, 1950, to become Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton. However, Lima-Hamilton's locomotive technology was unused after the merger and market share continued to dwindle. By January, 1952 Baldwin closed its factory in Rochelle, Il. and consolidated Whitcomb production at Eddystone. In 1953 Westinghouse discontinued building electrical traction equipment, so Baldwin was forced to reconfigure their drive systems based on General Electric equipment. [...] In 1954, during which time they were being virtually shut out of the Diesel market, Baldwin delivered one steam turbine-electric locomotive to the Norfolk and Western railroad, which proved unsatisfactory in service.|$|E

Post-1997 Madeline products were manufactured by BMG's manufacturing division, Sonopress, and order fulfillment was handled by BMG Distribution. These products were distributed {{to a wide range}} of retail outlets including: Best Buy, Circuit City, Computer City, Egghead Software, Office Depot, Price Club/Costco, Sam's Club, and Staples.

2500|$|A {{hydrocarbon}} refrigerant {{was developed}} at a German technological institute, and in 1992 {{came to the}} attention of the non-governmental organization (NGO) Greenpeace. [...] The NGO was given the patent, called it [...] "Greenfreeze," [...] and by 2013 it was being used by some 40 percent of the refrigerator market. [...] In the U.S., however, change has been much slower. [...] To some extent, CFCs were being replaced by the less damaging hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), although concerns remain regarding HCFCs also. In some applications, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were being used to replace CFCs. HFCs, which contain no chlorine or bromine, do not contribute at all to ozone depletion although they are potent greenhouse gases. The best known of these compounds is probably HFC-134a (R-134a), which in the United States has largely replaced CFC-12 (R-12) in automobile air conditioners. In laboratory analytics (a former [...] "essential" [...] use) the ozone depleting substances can be replaced with various other solvents. The development and promotion of an ozone-safe hydrocarbon refrigerant was a breakthrough which occurred after the initiative of a non-governmental organization (NGO). Civil society including especially NGOs, in fact, played critical roles at all stages of policy development leading up to the Vienna Conference, the Montreal Protocol, and in assessing compliance afterwards. The major companies claimed that no alternatives to HFC existed. [...] By 1992, the NGO Greenpeace had learned that a Hamburg technological institute in Germany had formulated an ozone-safe refrigerant. [...] The rights were donated to Greenpeace, who called the refrigerant [...] "Greenfreeze," [...] and left the patent as open source. [...] The NGO then worked successfully first with a small and struggling company to market an appliance beginning in Europe, then Asia and later Latin America, receiving a 1997 UNEP award. By 1995, Germany had already made CFC refrigerators illegal. Production spread to companies like Electrolux, Bosch, and LG, with sales reaching some 300 million refrigerators by 2008. [...] However, the giant corporations all continued to refuse to apply the technology in Latin America. [...] In 2003, a domestic Argentinian company began Greenfreeze production, while the giant Bosch in Brazil began a year later. [...] Chemical companies like Du Pont, whose representatives even disparaged the green technology as [...] "that German technology," [...] maneuvered the EPA to block the technology in the U.S. until 2011. [...] Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric, spurred by Greenpeace, had expressed formal interest in 2008 which figured in the EPA's final approval. Currently, more than 600 million refrigerators have been sold, making up more than 40 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> [...] Since 2004, corporations like Coca-Cola, Carlsberg, and IKEA have been forming a coalition to promote the ozone-safe Greenfreeze units.|$|E
