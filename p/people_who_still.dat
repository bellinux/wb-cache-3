5|$|From 1881 on, Pedro II's health began failing. He {{gradually}} {{withdrew from}} public affairs as time passed. Weary of being {{tied to a}} throne which he doubted would survive his death, he persevered out of duty and because there seemed no immediate alternative. Nor did his daughter and heir, Isabel, exhibit a desire to assume the crown. Both, however, were overwhelmingly beloved by the Brazilian <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>still</b> supported the monarchy. The indifference towards the Imperial system by the Emperor and his daughter allowed a discontented republican minority to grow more audacious and to eventually launch the coup that overthrew the Empire.|$|E
5|$|A {{thousand}} years before The Sword of Shannara, an Elf named Galaphile gathers {{all of the}} <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>still</b> had some knowledge {{of the old world}} to Paranor to try to bring peace and order to all of the races. They name themselves the First Druid Council. Brona, a rogue Druid, and his followers leave, taking the Ildatch with them; this magical tome controls their minds. 250 years later, Brona begins the First War of the Races when he convinces all Men to attack the other races. He almost succeeds in seizing rule of the Four Lands, but the tide turns, and the war ends with his defeat and disappearance. The Druids divide the Four Lands among the races and become reclusive, withdrawing to Paranor because of their shame at the betrayal by one of their own members.|$|E

25|$|The play {{opens with}} Wong, a water seller, {{explaining}} {{to the audience}} that {{he is on the}} city outskirts awaiting the foretold appearance of several important gods. Soon the gods arrive and ask Wong to find them shelter for the night. They are tired, having travelled far and wide in search of good <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>still</b> live according to the principles that they, the gods, have handed down. Instead they have found only greed, evil, dishonesty, and selfishness. The same turns out to be true in Szechwan: no one will take them in, no one has the time or means to care for others – no one except the poor young prostitute Shen Teh, whose pure inherent charity cannot allow her to turn away anyone in need. Shen Teh was going to see a customer, but decides to help out instead; however confusion follows leaving Wang fleeing from the illustrious Ones, leaving his water carrying pole behind.|$|E

500|$|The Tahiti rail was {{supposedly}} flightless, and nested on the ground. Its social behaviour is unknown. Bruner {{claimed to have}} gained information about the behaviour of the species from [...] "the few <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>still</b> remember the bird". According to Bruner, {{the call of the}} bird was described as similar to that of other rails, though it differed in ending in a high-pitched whistle. It was said to have been seen in open areas, sometimes with other rails in marshes, and in coconut plantations. Its diet appears to have consisted mainly of insects found in grass, and it occasionally fed on copra (coconut meat). Its broken colour pattern was said to make it blend well with its surroundings, and it lacked [...] "shyness".|$|E
500|$|Milo's {{trip through}} the lands beyond the tollbooth teaches the {{previously}} bored child to appreciate both journey and destination. This is a lesson that had been unlearned by the citizens of Wisdom, as exemplified by the described fate of the twin cities of Reality and Illusions. Although the city of Illusions never actually existed, Reality was lost as its residents concentrated on getting to their destination as quickly as possible, and, unappreciated, the city withered away, unnoticed by the busy <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>still</b> hasten along its former streets. Milo meets his trials by defining himself as different from the kingdom's inhabitants, who either demand or accept conformity, as enforced by the kingdom's laws, which discourage (and even outlaw) thought. Milo cannot accept such laws, beginning when, in the Doldrums, he thinks, thus violating a local ordinance and separating himself from the thoughtless inhabitants. Liston opined that because the Kingdom of Wisdom's [...] "laws require the impossible, they contradict {{what it means to}} be fully human".|$|E
500|$|Following {{news of the}} {{cancellation}} of Silent Hills, {{it was announced that}} P.T. would be removed from the PlayStation Network on 29 April 2015. Originally, it was reported that the demo could be re-downloaded, but in May 2015 it was no longer re-downloadable from the PlayStation Store. Cancellation of the game led to criticism of Konami. Patrick Klepek from Kotaku stated [...] "It's fine that Konami doesn't want to make Silent Hills" [...] but that the deletion of P.T. was wrong since the demo had become part of gaming culture. Nick Robinson of Polygon described Konami's removal as the [...] "most irresponsible, cowardly decision possible", but that the subsequent unavailability had also made the demo [...] "one of the coolest, most fascinating games {{in the history of our}} medium". After {{the cancellation}}, PlayStation 4 consoles with P.T. installed were listed on eBay for over $1000; eBay later pulled the auctions down. The incident has been compared to the mass selling of iPhones containing Flappy Bird after that game's removal from the iOS App Store. Guillermo del Toro, the intended future director of Silent Hills, commented on P.T.s popularity, speculating that there were <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>still</b> have a passion for the Silent Hill series.|$|E

2500|$|The {{campaign}} ultimately {{failed to}} destroy the influence of Buddhism on the Japanese <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>still</b> needed funerals, graves and ancestral rites, all services traditionally provided by Buddhism. The state's first attempt to influence religious life therefore resulted in failure. In 1873, the government admitted that the effort to elevate Shinto above Buddhism had failed. However, the government did cause the diffusion {{of the idea that}} Shinto was the true religion of the Japanese, finally revealed after remaining for a long time hidden behind Buddhism.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{surnames}} {{are equal}} to given names, such as Joana Fernando, or André João, in which [...] "Fernando" [...] and [...] "João" [...] are surnames, not given names. It is rather improbable {{that those are}} patronymics; more likely they originated with people with no surnames, who were given two names {{for the sake of}} enhanced individuality. One can find today in Portugal and Brazil <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>still</b> use surnames that for other people are just given names, although they were passed from parents to sons for generations, such as Valentim, Alexandre, Fernando, Afonso (note the family name de Melo Afonso) and Antonio (note de Melo Antonio). Names like Dinis, Duarte, Garcia and Godinho were originally given names, but today they are used in Brazil almost exclusively as surnames, although Duarte and Dinis are still common given names in Portugal.|$|E
2500|$|Because the {{composition}} and writing of BoA's songs is handled mostly by her staff, BoA has been criticized as being a [...] "manufactured pop star". In response to such criticism, BoA said that [...] "if one person were to force their own will on something, then things that should have gone right could easily go wrong" [...] and that she is [...] "not all that unhappy with the expression that [...] a manufactured star. In a way, that is true. Because SM Entertainment created the environment and all the surrounding conditions, [...] able {{to be successful in}} the way [...] now." [...] Though her earlier releases were marked by a [...] "cute" [...] and [...] "youthful" [...] style, BoA began to present a more [...] "mature" [...] image starting from the album My Name. In a Talk Asia interview, Anjali Rao noted that some felt that My Name marked the beginning of BoA's decline in popularity and asked if the public would always see the singer as [...] "Little Baby BoA"; BoA replied, [...] "So while I apologize to those <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>still</b> want the baby BoA, in fact, what can I do?

25|$|Indications for bracing: <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are <b>still</b> growing <b>who</b> {{present with}} Cobb angles less than 20 degrees should be closely monitored. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> are <b>still</b> growing <b>who</b> present with Cobb angles of 20 degrees to 29 degrees should be braced {{according}} {{to the risk of}} progression by considering age, Cobb angle increase over a six-month period, Risser sign, and clinical presentation. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> are <b>still</b> growing <b>who</b> present with Cobb angles greater than 30 degrees should be braced. However, these are guidelines and not every person will fit into this table. For example, a person <b>who</b> is <b>still</b> growing with a 17-degree Cobb angle and significant thoracic rotation or flatback could be considered for nighttime bracing. On {{the opposite end of the}} growth spectrum, a 29-degree Cobb angle and a Risser sign three or four might not need to be braced because there is reduced potential for progression. The Scoliosis Research Society's recommendations for bracing include curves progressing to larger than 25°, curves presenting between 30 and 45°, Risser sign 0, 1, or 2 (an X-ray measurement of a pelvic growth area), and less than six months from the onset of menses in girls.|$|R
2500|$|Other {{tribes are}} known to have {{inhabited}} Alberta in the past. [...] The Cluny Earthlodge Village at Blackfoot Crossing is a unique-in-Canada example of a permanent fortified village of earthlodges probably built around 1740 CE by Hidatsa or Mandan peoples. [...] The Assiniboine people lived in Alberta at the time of European contact, and it is thought that the Stoney <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>still</b> live in the province began as a branch of the Assiniboine. Early accounts by European explorers suggest that the Eastern Shoshone are thought to have lived in Alberta before being displaced by in Blackfoot by 1787. [...] The Gros Ventres were reported living in two north-south tribal groups; one, the so-called Fall Indians (Canadian or northern group) of 260 lodges (≈2,500 population) traded with the North West Company on the Saskatchewan River and roamed between the Missouri and Bow Rivers. [...] They were active in southern Alberta through the late 1800s, but were based near present-day Fort Belknap, Montana by 1862 when Jesuit missionaries arrived there. [...] The U.S. and Canadian governments sought to keep nomadic peoples from crossing the border, and the Americans opened an Indian agency to supply the Gros Ventre with aid at Fort Belknap first from 1871-1876, and permanently in 1878, with a reservation there being established in 1881. [...] The Kutenai migrated westwards out of Alberta, possibly in the early eighteenth century, but still occasionally ventured into the Bow River region to hunt bison by the time of European contact. [...] As well, people from other ethnic groups, such the Métis and Iroquois occasionally intermarried with local peoples and were adopted into existing bands or created their own new bands of mixed heritage. [...] An example is the Michel Band from the Calahoo area, many of whom are descended from William Callihoo, an Iroquois or Métis fur trader from the east who married one or more local Cree women and founded the band.|$|E
