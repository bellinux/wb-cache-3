The use of cover payments MT202, where {{the details of}} the beneficiary and originator were not usually present, represented a significant risk, particularly in situations where the underlying <b>payment</b> <b>message</b> (MT103) went directly to the beneficiary bank, often without passing through the same jurisdiction or filtering processes as the underlying MT202. This led for a new message MT202 Cov , which is more transparent and it has got the details of both Ordering and beneficiary customer. MT202 is no longer being used and it is mostly replaced by MT202 COV for cover payments.|$|E

40|$|Payment {{systems are}} {{undergoing}} rapid and fundamental changes stimulated largely by technological progress especially distributed network technology and real-time processing. Internet and e-commerce {{will have a}} major impact on payment systems in the future. User demands and competition will speed up developments. Payment systems will move from conventions that were originally paper-based to truly network-based solutions. This paper presents a solution – E-Settlement – for improving interbank settlement systems. It is based on a decentralised approach to be fully integrated with the banks’ payment systems. The basic idea is that central bank money, the settlement cover, is transferred as an encrypted digital stamp as part of the interbank <b>payment</b> <b>message.</b> The future payment systems would in this model operate close to the Internet/e-mail concept by sending payment messages directly from the sending bank’s account/payment server to the system of the receiving bank with immediate final interbank settlement without intervening centralised processing. Payment systems would become more efficient and faster and the overall structure would be come straightforward. The E-Settlement and network-based system concept could be applied with major benefits for correspondent banking, ACH and RTGS processing environments. In order to assess this novel idea the Bank of Finland built a prototype of the E-Settlement model. It consist of a group of emulated banks sending payments to each other via a TCP/IP network under the control of a central bank as the liquidity provider and an administration site monitoring the system security. This paper contains an introduction to network-based payment systems and E-Settlement, the specifications of the E-Settlement model and the description, results and experiences of the actual E-Settlement prototype. network-based payment systems; settlement systems; interbank settlement; payment system integration...|$|E
30|$|Once {{the session}} is initiated, after some data {{have been sent}} to the client, the vendor {{requests}} a payment. This payment is requested by using messages 8 and 9, but instead of an AdditionalPaymentRequest, a PaymentRequest is sent. If the client agrees to the <b>payment,</b> then, in <b>messages</b> 10 and 11, the payment is sent. Subsequent payments in the session are requested using messages 8 and 9 with AdditionalPaymentRequest and making <b>payment</b> with <b>messages</b> 10 and 11. Thus, the session continues while the client is making payments. Otherwise, the session finishes with messages 12 and 13.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Visa desires a {{high-quality}} payment experience for its cardholders, merchants, and Member banks. The application of formal techniques to model <b>payment</b> <b>messages</b> exchanged {{among the participants}} in a transaction {{has led to a}} substantial reduction in the incidence of interoperability problems. These occur when message fields that capture information about a transaction are incorrectly populated. Models allow the precise specification and shared understanding of the structure, semantics, and lifecycle of the data, and thereby enhance the overall payment experience. A monitoring environment is in place to analyze all transactions in the global VisaNet system against expected values and combinations of values specified in the models, and to take corrective action when interoperability issues are identified. Various standards activities are underway where models are applied to the creation of new financial messages and the evolution of existing ones...|$|R

Thus, the vendor has to control the time/the data sent and requires a payment once the unit of consumption (seconds or bytes) defined is spent.
