40|$|Determinants of {{type and}} timing of initial <b>permanent</b> {{hemodialysis}} vascular <b>access.</b> BackgroundWe undertook a population-based study of hemodialysis (HD) patients to determine which factors are important in predicting the type of <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> initially placed and if a functional <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> is {{in place at the}} start of HD. MethodsSelected characteristics were abstracted from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Study (DMMS) Wave 2. Logistic regression was used to estimate the independent contribution of specific characteristics in predicting whether the initial <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> placed was an arteriovenous (AV) fistula compared with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft, and in predicting whether <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> (fistula or graft) was in place at the initiation of dialysis. ResultsSixty-seven percent of the patients had an AV graft placed as their first <b>permanent</b> <b>access.</b> Characteristics important in predicting if a fistula was initially placed included age (per decade; aOR = 0. 84, P < 0. 001), female gender (aOR = 0. 52, P < 0. 001), body mass index (per standard deviation; aOR = 0. 70, P = 0. 09), avoiding blood draws (aOR = 1. 96, P < 0. 001), ability to ambulate (aOR = 2. 24, P = 0. 008), underlying renal disease (glomerular compared with diabetes, aOR = 2. 19, P = 0. 009), college education (aOR = 1. 72, P = 0. 002), and sharing in decision making (aOR = 1. 50, P = 0. 02). Thirty-four percent of patients (34. 4 %) had functional <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> at the start of HD. Characteristics important in predicting which patients had functional <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> included serum albumin (per 1 mg/dL increase, aOR = 1. 55, P = 0. 003), erythropoietin prior to starting HD (aOR = 1. 79, P = 0. 002), fewer predialysis nephrologist visits (aOR = 0. 21, P < 0. 001), and when the patient was told they had renal disease (aOR = 0. 33, P = 0. 002). ConclusionsPTFE grafts were the most common initial <b>permanent</b> <b>access.</b> The majority of patients did not have <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> at the start of dialysis. Factors that are thought to compromise identification of adequate veins were important predictors of PTFE graft placement. <b>Permanent</b> <b>access</b> at the start of HD was largely a function of early patient education and early referral to a nephrologist...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} to {{evaluate}} the status of initiating pattern of hemodialysis (HD). Five hundred-three patients in 8 University Hospitals were included. Presentation mode (planned vs. unplanned), and access type (central venous catheters [CVC] vs. <b>permanent</b> <b>access)</b> at initiation of HD were evaluated, {{and the influence of}} predialysis care on determining the mode of HD and access type was also assessed. Most patients started unplanned HD (81. 9 %) and the most common initial access type was CVC (86. 3 %). The main reason for unplanned HD and high rate of CVC use was patient-related factors such as refusal of <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> creation and failure to attend scheduled clinic appointments. Predialysis care was performed in 57. 9 % of patients and only 24. 1 % of these patients started planned HD and 18. 9 % used <b>permanent</b> <b>accesses</b> initially.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether age should inform our approach toward <b>permanent</b> vascular <b>access</b> placement {{in patients with}} chronic kidney disease, we conducted a retrospective cohort study among 11290 non-dialysis patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 25 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 based on 2000 – 2001 outpatient creatinine measurements in the Department of Veterans Affairs. For each age group, we examined the percentage of patients that had and had not received a <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> by 1 year after cohort entry, and the percentage {{in each of these}} groups that died, started dialysis, or survived without dialysis. We also modeled the number of unnecessary procedures that would have occurred in theoretical scenarios based on existing vascular access guidelines. The mean eGFR was 17. 7 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 at cohort entry. Twenty-five percent (n= 2870) of patients initiated dialysis within a year of cohort entry. Among these, only 39 % (n= 1104) had undergone surgery to place a <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> beforehand. As compared with younger patients, older patients were less likely to undergo <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> surgery, but also less likely to start dialysis. In all theoretical scenarios examined, older patients would have been more likely than younger patients to receive unnecessary procedures. If all patients had been referred for <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> surgery at cohort entry, the ratio of unnecessary to necessary procedures after 2 years of follow-up would have been 5 : 1 for patients aged 85 – 100 years but only 0. 5 : 1 for those aged 18 – 44 years.

40|$|Urban freight {{transport}} has many sustainable aspects. It contributes to economic vitality and {{the competitiveness of}} a region. However, the less socially and environmentally friendly effects such as noise, pollutant emissions, and nuisance, are usually the central theme in designing urban {{freight transport}} policies. Restricting policies as time <b>access</b> <b>restrictions</b> and vehicle restrictions gain popularity among Dutch local authorities. More {{than half of the}} municipalities uses time <b>access</b> <b>restrictions.</b> In spite of the popularity of these policy measures, the effects on the distribution of retailers, the environment and the transport costs are not known yet. In this paper we present three case studies of food retailers, in order {{to examine the effects of}} time <b>access</b> <b>restrictions</b> and vehicle weight restrictions. We discuss the impacts on the transport costs and the distribution processes (on the retailer’s side) and the environmental impacts. To find these effects we design five scenarios, in which we vary the length of time <b>access</b> <b>restrictions,</b> the allowed weight of the weight restriction and the number of cities in which these regulations are used. In these scenarios we adapt, based on the likely reaction of the involved food retailers, the distribution activities to fit the regulations. The results show that the vehicle weight restriction as well as the time <b>access</b> <b>restrictions</b> have a negative impact on the retailers’ transport costs. In most cases we see that the policy measures also cause an increase in the pollutant CO 2 emissions that are emitted during the distribution of the goods. The time <b>access</b> <b>restrictions</b> cause a cost-increase that develops more or less convexly, as more stores are affected by this policy measure. The turning point is around 45 % of the stores affected. The weight restriction causes linear cost-increase as more stores are affected. Both policy measures affect especially the roundtrips that combine multiple less than truckload orders for different stores. The policy measures have a different effect on different retailers...|$|R
