500|$|Wiens {{was charged}} with {{criminal}} defamation and given a <b>penalty</b> <b>order</b> to pay a fine of €330. After formally objecting and refusing to pay the fine, Wiens was tried at the district court of Dresden. He was found guilty by the court and fined €780 in November 2008. However, during the trial Wiens claimed mitigating circumstances for the act of insulting El-Sherbini, suggesting that [...] "people like her" [...] were not really human beings and therefore incapable of being insulted. The public prosecutor appealed the verdict, aiming at a custodial sentence, due to the openly xenophobic character of the incident. Wiens also appealed the verdict and was subsequently granted a court-appointed defence counsel. His counsel intended to withdraw the appeal before the scheduled hearing at the regional court, but Wiens objected to this.|$|E

50|$|Such cases led to {{branding}} becoming obsolete, {{and it was}} abolished in 1829 {{except in}} the case of deserters from the army, who were marked with the letter D, not with hot irons but by tattooing with ink or gunpowder. Notoriously bad soldiers were also branded with BC (bad character). The British Mutiny Act of 1858 provided that the court-martial might, in addition to any other <b>penalty,</b> <b>order</b> deserters to be marked on the left side, 2 inches (5 cm) below the armpit, with the letter D, such letter to be not less than an inch long. In 1879 this was abolished.|$|E

Voss was acquitted of the charge of assentingly accepting that an unbiased reader might interpret his statements as an approval of the September 11, 2001 {{terrorist attacks on the}} same day (cf. §140 StGB); {{during the course of the}} trial, it was also revealed that his disclaimer of the posting as sarcasm had been left out of the legal documents provided to the prosecutor by law enforcement agencies.|$|E

50|$|An NCAA {{investigation}} {{confirmed the}} violations, also finding that six players didn't pay for over $1,500 of long-distance telephone calls in December 2001. The telephone charges in question {{were due to}} hotel error and ultimately never charged to the program. Since they weren't valid charges, Georgia didn't self-report the violations until an internal investigation into the program in July 2003. In 2004 the NCAA placed Georgia on four years' probation for the violations. It also forced the Bulldogs to vacate half of their wins from 2001-02 and all their wins from 2002-03—30 games in all. Harrick, Jr. was given a seven-year show-cause <b>penalty</b> <b>order</b> {{for his role in}} the academic fraud, as well as telling two of the players involved to lie to the NCAA. The 'show-cause' effectively blackballed him from the college ranks until 2011 at the earliest.|$|E
5000|$|Congress {{added an}} {{operating}} permit {{program to the}} 1990 Clean Air Act for larger industries and commercial sources that release toxins into the air. These permits have information about which pollutants are emitted, how much may be emitted, and what actions the person in charge is taking to minimize the pollution. Permits must also state plans to measure and report the air pollution produced. The EPA is also responsible for making sure each state and tribe abides by the permits. For businesses that qualify {{for more than one}} thing under the Clean Air Act, operating permits are helpful because the information is all there. These permits tell them exactly {{what they need to do}} to prevent pollution. Now the EPA is more powerful in being able to enforce the rules instead of having to handle everything in court. The EPA can either [...] "issue an order requiring the violator to comply, issue and administrative <b>penalty</b> <b>order,</b> or bring a civil judicial action".|$|E
50|$|The Architects Registration Board (ARB) is the {{statutory}} {{body for the}} registration of architects in the United Kingdom. It operates under the Architects Act 1997 as amended, a consolidating Act. It began under the Architects (Registration) Act, 1931 which gave it the name the Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom (ARCUK). It prescribes architectural qualifications, maintains the Register of Architects and for registered persons has certain responsibilities for standards of professional conduct and competence. Its main source of income is fees payable under Part II of the Act by persons on their becoming registered or for their retention on the Register. The Board is required to pay into the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom any sum paid under a <b>penalty</b> <b>order</b> which its Professional Conduct Committee has made under Part III of the Act (in conduct cases). Fines imposed by Magistrates' Court (England and Wales) (or similar in Scotland or Northern Ireland) under Part IV of the Act (in misuse of title cases) are not payable to the Board.|$|E
50|$|LEPOR is {{designed}} with the factors of enhanced length penalty, precision, n-gram word <b>order</b> <b>penalty,</b> and recall. The enhanced length penalty {{ensures that the}} hypothesis translation, which is usually translated by machine translation systems, is punished if it is longer or shorter than the reference translation. The precision score reflects {{the accuracy of the}} hypothesis translation. The recall score reflects the loyalty of the hypothesis translation to the reference translation or source language. The n-gram based word <b>order</b> <b>penalty</b> factor {{is designed}} for the different position orders between the hypothesis translation and reference translation.

[11] studied adaptive bridge estimation for high-dimensional linear models. In addition, group structure of variables arise always in many contemporary statistical modeling problems. [12] proposed a group bridge method which not only effectively removes unimportant groups, but also maintains the flexibility of selecting variables within identified groups.
