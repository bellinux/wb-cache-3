He has declared that he manipulated his life at Auschwitz so as to avoid witnessing the camp's most unpalatable aspects.|$|E

5|$|Among the Virginia {{delegation}} to the House was James Madison, Patrick Henry's chief opponent in the Virginia ratification battle. In retaliation for Madison's victory in that battle at Virginia's ratification convention, Henry and other Anti-Federalists, who controlled the Virginia House of Delegates had gerrymandered a hostile district for Madison's planned congressional run and recruited Madison's future presidential successor, James Monroe, to oppose him. Madison defeated Monroe after offering a campaign <b>pledge</b> <b>that</b> he would introduce constitutional amendments comprising a Bill of Rights at the First Congress.|$|E
5|$|Murad sent Hadım Şehabeddin, Beylerbey (or governor) of Rumelia, to annex Wallachia in August 1442. Hunyadi annihilated the Ottoman {{army in the}} Carpathian Mountains in September, {{and made}} Vlad's cousin, Basarab, voivode of Wallachia. Before {{the end of the}} year, Murad II {{released}} Vlad. Vlad had to <b>pledge</b> <b>that</b> he would not support the enemies of the Ottoman Empire and he would pay an annual tribute and send 500 Wallachian boys to serve as janissaries in the sultan's army. He was also forced to leave his two sons, Vlad and Radu, as hostages in the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Following further {{speculation}} {{over her}} leadership, on 26 June a rumour emerged that supporters of Kevin Rudd were collecting signatures for a letter demanding an immediate leadership vote. That afternoon, before any letter had been published, Gillard called a leadership spill live on television. She challenged any would-be opponent {{to join her}} in a <b>pledge</b> <b>that,</b> while the winner would become leader, the loser would immediately retire from politics. Despite his earlier comments {{that he would not}} return to the leadership under any circumstances, Kevin Rudd announced that he would challenge Gillard for the leadership, and committed to retiring from politics if he lost. In the party-room ballot later that evening, Rudd defeated Gillard by a margin of 57 votes to 45.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{declined}} to seek re-election in 1880, keeping his <b>pledge</b> <b>that</b> {{he would not}} run for a second term. He was gratified {{with the election of}} fellow Ohio Republican James A. Garfield to succeed him, and consulted with him on appointments for the next administration. After Garfield's inauguration, Hayes and his family returned to Spiegel Grove. In 1881, he was elected a companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. He served as commander-in-chief (national president) of the Loyal Legion from 1888 until his death in 1893. Although he remained a loyal Republican, Hayes was not too disappointed in Grover Cleveland's election to the Presidency in 1884, approving of the New York Democrat's views on civil service reform. He was also pleased at the progress of the political career of William McKinley, his army comrade and political protégé.|$|E
5|$|With his family, he {{took part}} in the 1764 {{election}} of the new Polish monarch, Stanisław II August. In December 1767, Pulaski and his father became involved with the Bar Confederation, which saw King Stanisław as a Russian puppet and sought to curtail Russian hegemony over the Commonwealth. The confederation was actively opposed by the Russian forces stationed in Poland. Pulaski recruited a unit and on February 29, 1768, signed the act of the confederation, thus declaring himself an official supporter of the movement. On March 6, he received the rank of a pułkownik and commanded a choragiew of cavalry. In March and April he agitated among the Polish military, successfully convincing some forces to join the Confederates. He fought his first battle on April 20 near Pohorełe; it was a victory, as was another on April 23 near Starokostiantyniv. An engagement at Kaczanówka on April 28 resulted in a defeat. In early May he garrisoned Chmielnik, but was forced to retreat when allied reinforcements were defeated. He retreated to a monastery in Berdyczów, which he defended during a siege by royalist forces for over two weeks until June 16. Eventually he was forced to surrender and was taken captive by the Russians. On June 28, he was released in exchange for a <b>pledge</b> <b>that</b> he would not again take up arms with the Confederates, and that he would lobby the Confederates to end hostilities. However, Pulaski considered the pledge to be non-binding, and made a public declaration to that effect upon reaching a camp of the Confederates at the end of July. Agreeing to the pledge in the first place weakened his authority and popularity among the Confederates, and his own father considered whether or not he should be court-martialed; some heated debates followed and Pulaski was reinstated to active duty only in early September.|$|E

25|$|The initial U.S. {{response}} was to threaten to sever diplomatic ties, which persuaded the Germans to issue the Sussex <b>pledge</b> <b>that</b> reimposed restrictions on U-boat activity. The U.S. reiterated its objections to German submarine warfare whenever U.S. civilians {{died as a result}} of German attacks, which prompted the Germans to fully reapply prize rules. This, however, removed the effectiveness of the U-boat fleet, and the Germans consequently sought a decisive surface action, a strategy that culminated in the Battle of Jutland.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{losing his}} seat at McLaren for 2005, Coulthard insisted {{he had his}} team's backing, and made a <b>pledge</b> <b>that</b> his {{approach}} for 2004 would be more aggressive. He endured a consistent start: Coulthard managed to finish eighth in the first race in Australia despite being off the pace, and in the following race in Malaysia, he managed to take sixth position. During the race in Bahrain, both McLaren drivers were forced into retirement due to engine failures after fifty laps. Coulthard did not score {{in the next four}} races, which included consecutive retirements in Monaco and at the Nürburgring. He was able to take points scoring positions at the next two races in Canada and the United States.|$|E
25|$|During the Merdeka Talks of 1956, {{the year}} before Malaya's independence, the British agreed to grant Singapore {{self-government}} over domestic issues, while the British retained control of finance and the military. This seemed to satisfy Marshall initially, but the negotiation later broke down when the British refused to turn over internal security to the local government. The British felt that Marshall was {{not doing enough to}} counter the threats of the communist insurgency and the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) which had sparked the Malayan Emergency. The march towards independence was stalled and Marshall resigned in 1956 making good on his earlier <b>pledge</b> <b>that</b> he would step down in the case of failure.|$|E
25|$|The {{opening of}} each legal year is {{marked with a}} {{ceremony}} usually held on the first Saturday of January, though in 2011 it {{took place on the}} first Friday. In form it is a court hearing, though lawyers are not required to dress in court robes. During the ceremony, the Attorney-General and the President of the Law Society of Singapore deliver speeches. The Chief Justice then responds with his own speech, and also announces the names of advocates and solicitors appointed as Senior Counsel. The speeches generally summarize legal developments over the past year and look forward to the future, and the Attorney-General and Law Society President traditionally <b>pledge</b> <b>that</b> legal officers and legal practitioners will continue to support the judiciary and co-operate with each other.|$|E

25|$|The Memorial Tournament {{continues}} the PGA Tour's philanthropic focus through its relationships with Central Ohio charities. The most significant {{of which is}} its relationship with Nationwide Children's Hospital since 1976. Contributions generated through the support of over 2,600 volunteers are distributed each year to the Hospital's unrestricted giving fund. This fund assists in ensuring Central Ohio continues {{to have one of}} the best children's hospitals in the United States. The Memorial Tournament has raised more than $5.7million to support the programs and services at Nationwide Children's Hospital in those 30-plus years. In 2005 the Memorial made a <b>pledge</b> <b>that</b> will elevate its level of giving to more than $11million in the coming years. Unique and successful relationships also exist with Fore Hope, James Cancer Hospital, Wolfe Associates, The First Tee, Central Ohio Junior Golf Association, Shriners, Lions Club and many more.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all {{the unions}} {{that belonged to}} the CIO were fully {{supportive}} of both the war effort and of the Roosevelt administration. However the United Mine Workers, who had taken an isolationist stand in the years leading up to the war and had opposed Roosevelt's reelection in 1940, left the CIO in 1942. The major unions supported a wartime no-strike <b>pledge</b> <b>that</b> aimed to eliminate not only major strikes for new contracts, but also the innumerable small strikes called by shop stewards and local union leadership to protest particular grievances. In return for labor's no-strike pledge, the government offered arbitration to determine the wages and other terms of new contracts. Those procedures produced modest wage increases during {{the first few years of}} the war but not enough to keep up with inflation, particularly when combined with the slowness of the arbitration machinery.|$|E
25|$|After Earnhardt's death, both {{a police}} {{investigation}} and a NASCAR-sanctioned investigation commenced; nearly {{every detail of}} the crash was made public. The allegations of seatbelt failure resulted in Bill Simpson's resignation from the company bearing his name, which manufactured the seatbelts used in Earnhardt's car and nearly every other NASCAR driver's car. NASCAR implemented rigorous safety improvements, such as mandating the HANS device, which Earnhardt refused to wear after finding it restrictive and uncomfortable. Several press conferences were held in the days following Earnhardt's death. After driver Sterling Marlin and his relatives received hate mail and death threats from angry fans, Waltrip and Earnhardt Jr. absolved him of any responsibility. Richard Childress made a public <b>pledge</b> <b>that</b> the number 3 would never again adorn the side of a black race car with a GM Goodwrench sponsorship. Childress, who holds the rights from NASCAR to the No.3, placed a moratorium on using it; the number returned for the 2014 season, driven by Childress's grandson Austin Dillon.|$|E
