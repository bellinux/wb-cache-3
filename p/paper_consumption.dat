40|$|Although the {{paperless}} office (PLO) management {{system has been}} established {{with the goal of}} paper usage reduction, demand for paper has still showed an uptrend over the years. Given the substantial pressure on forest ecosystems due to a continued increase of <b>paper</b> <b>consumption,</b> understanding the behavioral aspects of <b>paper</b> <b>consumption</b> is, therefore, required. This present paper aims at exploring the factors underlying <b>paper</b> <b>consumption</b> behavior. Empirical data was acquired through a survey of 266 Indonesian students, involving both undergraduate and postgraduate students. A theoretical model, based on the Comprehensive Action Determination Model (CADM), was tested against the empirical data. It was found that the model received reasonable support from the data. Results indicate that reducing <b>paper</b> <b>consumption</b> behavior is strongly influenced by habit and, marginally significant, by intention. Furthermore, habit formation is influenced by both normative processes and situational influences.
