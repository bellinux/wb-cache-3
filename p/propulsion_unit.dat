25|$|Several {{variations}} {{exist in}} two general groups. The first preserves the two-stroke-engine sound by tuning the original two-cylinder engine for higher performance or using a two-stroke <b>propulsion</b> <b>unit</b> designed for another car, {{such as the}} 1000cc Wartburg). Since the Trabant is light——a small increase in engine power can rapidly increase its power-to-weight ratio.

25|$|The BMP-3 has a {{range of}} 600km, an {{altitude}} of operation of up to 3,000m and it is transportable by train, truck, sea, and air. The BMP-3 engine is a diesel four-stroke, liquid-cooled design. The transmission is a four-speed hydromechanical power unit, with power takeoff to its water jets. The suspension is independent, with a torsion bar and six hydraulic shock absorbers. Steering is by gear differential with hydrostatic drive. The track adjusting mechanism is remotely controlled from the driver's station, with tension force indication. The water-jet <b>propulsion</b> <b>unit</b> is single-stage, axial, auger-type.|$|E

25|$|The Panzerfaust 3 {{series of}} {{launchers}} is a compact, lightweight, shoulder-fired, unguided antitank weapon series. It {{consists of a}} disposable canister with a 110-mm warhead and reusable firing and sighting device. The DM12 and DM12A1 projectile consists of a shaped-charge warhead and is filled with Octol 7030, while the tandem DM22 warheads are made of PBX octogene (ca. 95% β-HMX) including the <b>propulsion</b> <b>unit.</b> The penetration performance of the Panzerfaust 3 {{is due to the}} shaped charge principle and the quick response of the percussion fuze; the effect on the target does not depend on the impact velocity.|$|E
25|$|Model tests {{conducted}} by MARC in 1994 {{showed that a}} double acting ship equipped with an Azipod <b>propulsion</b> <b>unit</b> could break through ice ridges in continuous motion instead of ramming like conventional icebreakers. It also required less power for running in level ice than traditional designs, resulting in 40–50% reduction in ice resistance due to lubricating effect of propeller-induced water flow, more open stern design and the propellers being allowed to mill (crush) the ice. The icebreaking capability of an Azipod-equipped icebreaker operating astern in level ice was also found out to be superior to traditional icebreakers regardless of propulsion arrangement.|$|E

40|$|This Bachelor {{thesis is}} a part of a {{bachelor}} project which includes building, programming and controlling a 3 DOF tandem helicopter. This particular report deals with the <b>propulsion</b> <b>units,</b> i. e. the motors and propellers of the helicopter. It covers the process of how to determine the most suitable <b>propulsion</b> <b>units</b> for the rig that eventually will enable it to run. To achieve this, different data have been processed. Torque and thrust are two important parameters that have been studied. The data have been acquired by different tests, e. g. thrust measurements from a thrust rig. Also more complex analysis such as Blade Element Theory and Actuator Disk Theory have been carried out {{in order to determine the}} behaviour of the <b>propulsion</b> <b>units.</b> Study data sheets and databases was also a part of the work.

2500|$|Because of the {{limitations}} of traditional propulsion systems, the double acting ship concept wasn't seriously considered until the development of electric podded propulsion units which combine the advantages of the diesel-electric powertrain, already widely used in icebreakers, with the excellent manoeuvrability of azimuth thrusters. Initially developed as a co-operation between the multinational electrical equipment corporation ABB Group and the Finnish shipbuilder Masa-Yards in the late 1980s, the new <b>propulsion</b> <b>unit</b> became known as Azipod (a portmanteau of [...] "azimuth thruster" [...] and [...] "podded propulsion unit") which is today a trademark of ABB Group.|$|E

50|$|Polaris {{features}} a novel propulsion system consisting of three electrically driven ABB Azipod <b>propulsion</b> <b>units,</b> {{one of which}} is located in the bow of the vessel. The stern <b>propulsion</b> <b>units</b> are rated at 6.5megawatts each while the azimuth thruster in the bow has propulsion power of 6megawatts. Each ice-strengthened Azipod unit has a four-bladed stainless steel propeller with removable blades and weighs 135 tons. This new type of propulsion system was selected to fulfill the strict operational capability requirements set by the Finnish Transport Agency particularly in ridged ice fields. The combined propulsion power of the three <b>propulsion</b> <b>units,</b> , makes Polaris the most powerful icebreaker ever to fly the Finnish flag as well as the most powerful icebreaker built specifically for escort operations in the Baltic Sea.|$|R

2500|$|A novel cargo {{handling}} {{feature of the}} SA-15 class freighters was an air cushion platform which could be carried on the weather deck and used to transport cargo ashore or directly to a warehouse in locations having little or no {{cargo handling}} facilities.

2500|$|The buzzing {{sound of}} the V-1's pulse jet engine was likened by some to [...] "a motor cycle in bad running order". As it reached its target and dived, the {{sound of the}} <b>propulsion</b> <b>unit</b> {{spluttering}} and cutting out, followed by an eerie hush before impact, was quite terrifying, though the silence was also a warning to seek shelter (later V-1s were corrected to have the originally-intended power dive). [...] At least one business in London advertised how quickly a patron could access a nearby shelter. Despite this, the cloudy and rainy conditions of June and July aided the effectiveness of the weapon and casualties were high. By late August {{a million and a half}} people had left London and the rate of work production was affected. By the late summer and autumn, however, increasingly effective countermeasures against the V-1 were taken and people started returning to London.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-In this paper, a fully-distributed {{system-level}} control {{architecture is}} described for dispatching, routing, and collision avoidance of multiple passive vehicles {{moving in a}} guideway network formed by a multitude of <b>propulsion</b> <b>units.</b> <b>Propulsion</b> <b>units</b> cooperate using a communication network with a topol-ogy identical {{to that of the}} guideway network, eliminating the need for explicit knowledge of global topography and enabling rapid real-time response to service requests using a parallel, shortest-route algorithm. The concepts developed are applied to a high-performance system in which vehicles respond to spontaneous requests to transfer material from point to point in manufacturing facilities in seconds rather than the minutes required in conventional AGV and conveyor systems. In this application, the vehicle and propulsion-unit lengths are on the same order of magnitude, the propulsion-unit-IengtWmaxhum-vehicle-velocity time characteristic is small, and the ratio of the number of <b>propulsion</b> <b>units</b> to the number of vehicles is large.
