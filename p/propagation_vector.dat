40|$|International audienceIn {{multisensor}} {{signal processing}} (underwater acoustics, geophysics, etc.), the initial dataset is usually separated into complementary subspaces called signal and noise subspaces {{in order to}} enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. The singular value decomposition (SVD) is a useful tool to achieve this separation. It provides two orthogonal matrices that convey information on normalized wavelets and <b>propagation</b> <b>vectors.</b> As signal and noise subspaces are on the whole well evaluated, usually the SVD procedure cannot correctly extract only the source waves {{with a high degree of}} sensor to sensor correlation. This is due to the constraint given by the orthogonality of the <b>propagation</b> <b>vectors.</b> To relax this condition, exploiting the concept of independent component analysis (ICA), we propose another orthogonal matrix made up of statistically independent normalized wavelets.

30|$|In {{applications}} that require hands-free capture of speech, the desired speech signal is often corrupted by background noise and interfering speech signals. Such applications involve human-to-human and human-to-machine communication, where speech enhancement is crucial: in the former, {{to improve the}} communication comfort, and in the latter, to ensure low error rate of speech recognisers. In this work, we address scenarios where the desired speaker has a known DOA {{with respect to the}} microphones, such as in-car applications, or voice-controlled devices where the source of interest is restricted to a pre-defined DOA. Given the DOA of the desired source and assuming anechoic propagation, fixed spatial filters such as the delay-and-sum beamformer (DSB) [1] or superdirective beamformers [2] can be used. However, these filters are suboptimal as they do not consider the spatio-temporal statistics of the signals, and often provide insufficient interference reduction. Moreover, propagation model mismatch due to reverberation and DOA errors further limit the performance. In this work, we focus on optimal data-dependent spatial filters [3, 4]. Two main paradigms can be distinguished which aim at optimal filtering given the source DOA: robust adaptive beamformers (RABs) and informed spatial filters (ISFs). While RABs seek to improve the robustness to errors in the DOAs and the signal <b>propagation</b> <b>vectors,</b> ISFs address the estimation of <b>propagation</b> <b>vectors</b> and signal statistics from the microphone signals, and their usage for optimal spatial filtering.|$|R

50|$|One {{undesirable}} {{effect of}} angle tuning {{is that the}} optical frequencies involved do not propagate collinearly with each other.

Two other methods of phase matching avoid beam walk-off by forcing all frequencies to propagate at a 90° with respect to the optical axis of the crystal.

Initially, his interest was focused on multi-photon transitions treated by non-perturbation quantum theory. However, he switched to perturbation methods in quantum theory when it became possible experimentally to attain ultra-high laser intensities at very high frequencies based on the High-Intensity High-Frequency Floquet Theory (HI-HFFT). His investigations lead to very surprising results—the phenomenon of ``atomic dichotomy" [...] in which the hydrogen atom when it is placed in a linearly polarized field exhibits a splitting of its spherical charge distribution into two lobes that oscillate in the laser field. On the other hand, in a circularly polarized laser field, thehydrogen atom's charge distribution takes on a toroidal shape with its symmetry axis oriented along the <b>propagation</b> <b>vector</b> {{of the field and}} passing {{through the center of the}} atom. His theory also predicts for two-electron atoms the appearance of a new bound state which is induced by the ultra-intense laser field; these are 'light-induced excited states'. Apparently paradoxical events do occur in the presence of the extremely intense laser field: a proton can bind more than two electrons thus leading to the formation of hydrogen negative ions with multiple negative charges that are relatively stable. Other novel and unexpected properties of molecules were also predicted in the presence of such ultra-intense laser fields.|$|E
