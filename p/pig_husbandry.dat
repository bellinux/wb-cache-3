50|$|Nineteenth-century {{agriculture}} in Jettenbach {{was characterized by}} many small farms. The farmers with bigger farms had horses, and sometimes oxen as draught animals. On smaller farms, the cow {{was used as a}} draught animal. From this need arose the almost exclusive use of the Glan-Donnersberg breed of cattle. It dominated in Jettenbach even into the 1960s. Most farms did cropraising and livestock <b>husbandry.</b> <b>Pig</b> farming was rather rare, and sheep were only raised until about the turn of the 19th century. Specialized crops are no longer raised in Jettenbach, although the village {{is said to have been}} a main growing centre for rapeseed in the Landcommissariat of Kusel in the years after 1820 (4 226 hl in 1826). About 1870, herb growing, particularly for the seed, was important in the village. Among the herbs then grown were hops, for the brewery that was then found in Jettenbach. Winegrowing may have been practised here in the Middle Ages, bearing witness to which are certain local cadastral toponyms. Between 1870 and 1900 there was once again a vineyard (1 000 m²) in the village. There was also fruitgrowing in a meadow orchard.|$|R
40|$|Agriculture {{contributes}} {{significantly to}} the anthropogenic emissions of non-CO 2 greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide. In this paper, a review is presented of the agriculture related sources of methane and nitrous oxide, and of the main strategies for mitigation. The rumen {{is the most important}} source of methane production, especially in cattle husbandry. Less, but still substantial, amounts of methane are produced from cattle manures. In <b>pig</b> and poultry <b>husbandry,</b> most methane originates from manures. The main sources of nitrous oxide are: nitrogen fertilisers, land applied animal manure, and urine deposited by grazing animals. Most effective mitigation strategies for methane comprise a source approach, i. e. changing animals¿ diets towards greater efficiencies. Methane emissions, however, can also be effectively reduced by optimal use of the gas produced from manures, e. g. for energy production. Frequent and complete manure removal from animal housing, combined with on-farm biogas production is an example of an integrated on-farm solution. Reduced fertiliser nitrogen input, optimal fertiliser form, adding nitrification inhibitors, land drainage management, and reduced land compaction by restricted grazing are the best ways to mitigate nitrous oxide emissions from farm land, whereas, management of bedding material and solid manure reduce nitrous oxide emissions from housing and storage. Other than for methane, mitigation measures for nitrous oxide interact with other important environmental issues, like reduction of nitrate leaching and ammonia emission. Mitigation strategies for reduction of the greenhouse gases should also minimize pollution swapping...|$|R

Beyond that, OUT appeared to be beneficial with regard to several areas of AHW, which could be explained by the environmental conditions, e. g. respiratory problems (air quality), diarrhoea (exposure to faeces) and lameness (flooring). POUT farms in most cases kept SO outdoors and WE and FA similar to IN farms, and this was reflected in the results.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to elicit an opinion from experts on the {{probable}} extent of the silent spread of Foot -and-mouth-disease (FMD) in Finland in an intensive pig production area starting in a pig farm (Ilmajoki) and an intensive cattle herding area starting in a cattle herd (Nivala). The twelve experts {{involved in the project}} belong to the permanent group of national experts (epidemiologists, veterinarians and virologists) required by the FMD directive. The assignment consisted of identification and evaluation of major risk factors or spreading the disease in Finnish animal husbandry settings, and the actual estimation of the probable spread based on the risk factors and compiled background information. The most important risk factors were transport of animals (from farm to farm, to the slaughterhouse, carcass disposal), and visits by members of certain professions (e. g. veterinarians) to the farms. Airborne spread was not considered to constitute a significant risk in Finland. The infection was estimated to silently spread to four pig farms and three cattle herds in Ilmajoki area whereas in Nivala it would spread to seven cattle herds and one <b>pig</b> farm. Sheep <b>husbandry</b> is a very minor industry in both areas and the infection was not estimated to spread to sheep flocks in either area. The figures are averages of the twelve expert estimates.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Recent policy {{developments}} {{in the area of}} livestock husbandry have suggested that, from the perspective of optimizing animal welfare, new animal husbandry systems should be developed that provide opportunities for livestock animals to be raised in environments where they are permitted to engage in ``natural behavior. ¿¿ It is not known whether consumers regard animal husbandry issues as important, and whether they differentiate between animal husbandry and other animal welfare issues. The responsibility for the development of such systems is allocated jointly between farmers, regulators, different actors in the food chain, and consumers. This research focuses on understanding consumer attitudes and preferences regarding the development and introduction of such systems, to ensure that they are acceptable to consumers as well as producers, regulators, and scientists. Consumer perceptions of animal welfare and animal husbandry practices were evaluated using quantitative consumer survey, which focused on two animal husbandry issues ¿ farmed pigs and farmed fish. Following pilot work, 1000 representative Dutch consumers were sampled about their attitudes to either <b>pig</b> or fish <b>husbandry.</b> The results indicated that consumers think about animal welfare in terms of two broad categories related to their health and living environment, but do not think about welfare issues at a more detailed level. Greater concern was expressed about the welfare of pigs compared to fish. Consumer trust in labeling also emerged as an important issue, since consumers need to trust different food chain actors with responsibility for promoting animal welfare, and are reluctant to consider the details of animal husbandry systems. As a consequence, a transparent, enforceable, and traceable monitoring system for animal welfare friendly products is likely to be important for consumers...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} the first {{comprehensive}} evaluation of the pig's cultural, economic and social significance in Scotland for the time period 1600 - 1815. It explores a range of aspects of the pig's role at this time, including the evidence for social attitudes towards the animal, particularly {{in relation to the}} alleged prejudice against pork, and pigs in general, and considers the role of folklore and literature in the construction of an unflattering and enduring image of the pig. The evaluation of social attitudes to the pig over this time period, particularly through the use of textual analysis, is the foundation to understanding the pig's role in a Scottish context. Changing attitudes to the type of pig considered worth rearing as it becomes an economically viable animal are demonstrated {{in the context of a}} rapidly changing agricultural and commercial environment in the course of the eighteenth century. The study also investigates patterns of <b>pig</b> production and <b>husbandry</b> such as the seasonality of pig-rearing and means of animal control. Patterns of pork consumption are examined for evidence of the pig's culinary use and how this relates to social class. Lastly, the research concentrates on the pig's commercial role, examining the significance of economic factors, such as the price and quality of salt determining the market for and profitability of preserved meat, particularly in relation to Aberdeen's barrelled pork industry.

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of the economy has created an increasing demand for energy in China. The limited resources of fossil energy are a risk {{for the development of}} China. Sustainable agriculture like organic farming (Green AAA in China) with biomass energy - as done in developed countries like Germany - is an option to reduce these risks. In China, agriculture is not energy efficient, and the intensive farming is not sustainable. The scientific challenge is to develop sustainable farming systems which can fulfill national food security, food safety and considerable renewable energy production without harming the environment, and are acceptable to the people and the economy. The protection and intelligent utilization of resources is the core of rural village development. To explore the potential of recent Chinese agriculture for the development towards a multi-functional farm for food and energy production, a village in the adjacent area of Beijing has been selected: the “Beijing Man village”. About 1, 900 people live in the village and 140 hectares of the 240 hectare total land are available for farming. The major agricultural activity is pork production (capacity of 10, 000 pigs per year) and dairy farming (40 dairy cows). In 2004, the energy input and output of this village was evaluated and taken as a basis for a model of sustainable farming for food and biogas production. The study explored that the gross energy production from crops in the “Beijing man village” was about 19, 103 GJ/year.

40|$|Pigs {{have played}} a major role in the economic, social and {{symbolic}} systems of China since the Early Neolithic more than 8, 000 years ago. However, the interaction between the history of pig domestication and transformations in Chinese society since then, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigated the co-evolution from the earliest farming communities through to the new political and economic models of state-like societies, up to the Chinese Empire, using 5, 000 years of archaeological records from the Xiawanggang (XWG) and Xinzhai (XZ) sites (Henan Province). To trace the changes of <b>pig</b> populations against <b>husbandry</b> practices, we combined the geometric morphometric analysis of dental traits with a study of the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios from bone collagen. The domestication process intensified during the Neolithic Yangshao, prompted by greater selective pressure and/or better herd control against wild introgression. After that, pig farming, in XWG, relied on local livestock and a gradual change of husbandry practices overtime. This was characterized by a gentle increase in millet foddering and animal protein intake, until a complete change over to household management during the Han dynasty. The only rupture in this steady trend of husbandry occurred during the Longshan period, with the appearance of small sized and idiosyncratic pigs with specific feeding practices (relying on millet and household scraps). From three exploratory hypothesis, we explored the possibility of anti-elite pig production in XWG during the Longshan period, as a means to resist incorporation into a new economic model promoting intensified domestic production. This exploratory hypothesis is the most suitable to our dataset; however, numerous areas need to be explored further in order to adequately document the role of pigs in the rise of China's complex societies...|$|R

We report on a study of 1051 epileptics in western Kenya. In total, 628 respondents answered a detailed questionnaire on risk factors on socio-economic determinants including <b>pig</b> <b>husbandry.</b> We describe the profile of a typical epileptic in western Kenya and their typical <b>pig</b> <b>husbandry</b> system. We also assess risk factors related to <b>pig</b> <b>husbandry,</b> pork consumption, poverty, occupation, practices around water and sanitation, education and knowledge. A quarter of households kept pigs at the time of survey and half had kept pigs in the past, most kept local breeds and at most pigs were at least partially free-range. Meat inspection was infrequently practiced. One third of the epileptics reported observing nodules in pork meat and one half had observed tapeworm segments in their own faeces. Sanitation practices, spatial location and occupation were the most important risk factors. Contrary to our initial hypotheses, neither poverty nor intensifying pig-keeping were predictive of disease, and possible reasons for this are discussed. By conducting disease surveys that simultaneously address humans and animal risk factors additional insights can be gained into zoonoses epidemiology...|$|E

Most (74 %) of all injuries were work-related. The most frequent types of injury (63 %) were bruises, sprains/strains and fractures. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that farmers working in dairy farming (OR = 2. 6) or <b>pig</b> <b>husbandry</b> (OR = 2. 7), older farmers (OR = 1. 48 per 10 years) and smokers (OR= 1. 7) were at increased risk.

Whether this phenomenon was accompanied by increasing specialization of the economy may be investigated through the zooarchaeology of pastoral systems. The scale of herding is an important element of this framework. A case study was conducted on the tell sites of Harsova and Bordusani-Popina situated in the Danube River basin. Both sites, located respectively on a terrace of the river and on the island of Balta Ialomitei, delivered occupations from the Gumelnita A 2 dated to the second half of 5 th millennium cal BC. Their occupants subsisted on an economy focused to a large extent on aquatic resources but also heavily dependent on cattle, <b>pig</b> and caprines <b>husbandry</b> and agriculture. The role of riverbanks resources in herding strategies {{and the extent to which}} the island of Balta Ialomitei may have sustained domestic animal stocks was addressed through stable isotope analysis of animal skeleton remains. At both sites, results revealed local herding for cattle and caprines, reflected in an unexpectedly high contribution of C 4 plants to their diet, most likely from ruderal C 4 plants that are more abundant around the settlements as well as in cultivated fields. Domestic pigs had a higher trophic status than their wild counterparts, highlighting a significant contribution of animal protein to their diet most likely provided by human activities, suggesting that they were maintained in the settlement. Overall the findings suggest domestic stocks were reared in close proximity to the settlements, rather than in an extensive system. This scheme complements the small-scale cultivation system highlighted from the archaeobotanical analysis. Gumelnit¸ a tell sites have been previously described as being part of larger pastoral systems including locations with complementary functions, although functional complementarity in time was not made explicit in this model.

40|$|Livestock play an {{important}} role in the social, cultural and economic environment of the Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs). Currently, the development of the livestock sector in the Pacific region is constrained by a number of factors, including animal health status requirements. So far, the Pacific Islands region has a favourable animal health situation but it is a challenge to maintain a disease free environment in an area composed of 25, 000 islands dispersed over 180 million square kilometres. While most of the PICTs face a critical shortage of veterinarians and have limited financial resources, this study aims to examine ways by which animal disease surveillance in the Pacific Islands region could be better targeted to enable more efficient use of scarce resources in the PICTs. Within this context, a literature review was conducted to synthesize data across studies from peer-reviewed and grey literature on the animal diseases in the Pacific Islands region. Based on the outputs of the meta-analysis, a multicriteria prioritization process was then developed to identify animal diseases perceived to be of importance by decision makers within selected PICTs, at the regional and national levels. <b>Pig</b> and poultry <b>husbandry</b> being of primary importance for the Pacific communities, farmer practices and the movements of pigs and poultry were then examined in four selected PICTs (Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu), using questionnaire survey and social network analysis tools in view of better predicting how diseases could potentially spread in the region. Finally, a combined pig and poultry market chain and risk pathway analysis was conducted in these four PICTs to identify the highest risk areas (risk hotspots) and risky practices and behaviours (risk factors) of animal disease introduction and/or spread, using highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) as model diseases because of their potential importance in the region. From the 158 eligible references retrieved from the literature review, only 77 (48. 7...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objectives}} of the project were to assess heavy metal flows on livestock farms {{and to develop a}} strategy to reduce heavy metal inputs into animal manures. For the experiments 20 farms with animal husbandry in various regions of Germany were selected. On the farms the inputs and outputs of the elements copper and zinc, as well as lead, cadmium, chromium and nickel were balanced at the stable level. The effect of abatement measures was evaluated using a calculation tool for stable balances. It is shown, the main input pathways for heavy metals into animal manures are, apart from copper disinfectants, feeding stuffs and feed supplements. Home grown feeds are the major source of heavy metal input into the stable because they are fed in large quantities. However, the heavy metal content of the home grown feeds in particular of roughages for ruminants is low. Purchased feed stuffs (supplementary feeding stuffs and complete feeding stuffs) were found to have a higher content of heavy metals (due to supplementation with trace elements) compared to home grown feeds. Thus, <b>pig</b> and poultry <b>husbandry</b> rather than ruminant husbandry is susceptible to heavy metal accumulation of manures. Heavy metals are cycling within the farm which is of importance when discussing the environmental impact. The turnover within the farm can hardly be controlled by the farmer. Thus, effective strategies have to be targeted at the inputs, e. g. the purchased feed stuffs. A main option to reduce the heavy metal input is to lower the trace element concentrations in supplementary feed stuffs either by legislation of maximum threshold values (e. g. EG 1334 / 2003) or by volunteer agreements of the feed industry and agriculture. In addition, the absorption of copper and zinc by the animals should be improved using better absorbable trace element compounds and phytase. (orig.)
