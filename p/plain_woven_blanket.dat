40|$|An {{analytical}} model is presented for the compressive behaviour of <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric composites under on-axis uniaxial loading. Analysis {{is based on}} curved beams on elastic foundation approach. The contributions of all the three structural elements within the <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric composite, namely longitudinal strand, transverse strand and pure matrix region have been considered. During compressive loading, the load sharing between structural elements is worked out and the stress state throughout the composite is determined. Effect of failed structural elements is taken into account for further calculations. Compressive strength, modulus of elasticity and failure strain data has been generated for different fabric geometries for both <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric E-glass/epoxy and T 300 carbon/epoxy composites. Experiments {{have been carried out}} on typical <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric E-glass/epoxy composites for validation.

Comparison is made between the off-axis elastic properties of <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric laminates and cross-ply laminates.

The flame retardation properties, mechanical properties and wear behaviors of PANOF <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabrics were tested. The {{limiting oxygen index}} (LOI) of these PANOF <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric samples was 31 %, which meets the criterion of flame-retardant fabrics. These fabrics neither melt nor shrunk when left in flame {{for a short period}} of time and the fabric structures were well maintained.

The materials investigated are 2 D <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> E-glass/epoxy, 2 D <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> T 300 carbon/epoxy and 2 D <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> E-glass fabric.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the influence of weave structures and silica coatings obtained via sol-gel process on the thermal insulation properties of cotton samples. For this reason three main <b>weave</b> structures (<b>plain,</b> satin, and piqué) of cotton fabric were selected with different yarn count, threads per cm, and mass per square meter values. Thereafter, only for the <b>plain</b> <b>weave,</b> the samples were padded using silica sol formed by hydrolysis and subsequent condensation of 3 -glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane under acidic conditions. The silanized <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> samples were characterized by TGA and FT-IR techniques. The thermal properties were measured with a home-made apparatus in order to calculate thermal conductivity, resistance, and absorption of all the treated fabric samples. The relationship between the thermal insulation properties of the <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabrics and the concentration of sol solutions has been investigated. Fabrics weave and density were found to strongly influence the thermal properties: piqué always shows the lowest values and satin shows the highest values while <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> lies in between. The thermal properties of treated high-density cotton <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric were proved to be strongly influenced by finishing agent concentration...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two-dimensional {{models are}} {{presented}} for the elastic {{analysis of a}} <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric lamina. These models {{take into account the}} actual fabric structure by consid-ering the fiber undulation and continuity along both the warp and weft directions, possible presence of gap between adjacent yarns, actual cross-sectional geometry of the yarn and possible unbalanced nature of the <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric. Typical studies on the effect of fiber undulation and lamina thickness on the in-plane elastic constants are presented. A large discrepancy, similar to that reported in literature, is found between the predicted elastic moduli of <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric lamina by ID WF models and experimental results. On the other hand, the predictions of 2 D WF models are fairly good since the two-dimensional extent of the fabric is considered in these models.
