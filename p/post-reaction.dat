We are conducting laboratory-scale geochemical and mineralogical studies on reservoir and cap rock samples in the Illinois Basin that complement the on-going Illinois Basin - Decatur Project (IBDP), a large-scale one million tonne demonstration of geologic sequestration in the Mt Simon Sandstone, Illinois USA. Mt. Simon Sandstone, Eau Clare Shale, and Knox Supergroup samples from the IBDP injection and deep monitoring wells and locations with rocks analogous to those at the IBDP site have been selected for simulated reactions using synthetic brine and CO 2 in modified Parr pressure reactors at pressure and temperature conditions that correspond to ambient reservoir conditions (9. 87 to 20. 7 MPa and 38 to 50 °C) and for varying amounts of time (1 to 9 months). Using petrographic techniques and XRD analysis, samples have been analyzed before and after reactor experiments to define the mineralogical and textural baseline and report observed changes. Brine composition has also been analyzed for geochemical changes. The React® and Differential Evolution geochemical modeling programs are being used to simulate changes in mineral mass and brine chemistry. <b>Post-reaction</b> analyses of rock and brine samples from the Mt.

30|$|The {{process of}} dry {{reforming}} of methane {{has the potential}} to be an effective route for CO 2 utilization via syn-gas production. In the present study, ZrO 2 -supported Co–Mo bimetallic carbide catalysts were prepared via a co-precipitation method through a combined reduction and carburization procedure employing a CH 4 /H 2 (20 / 80  %) mixture. All of the as-synthesized materials were tested at 850 °, under atmospheric pressure and a CO 2 :CH 4 ratio of 1. The importance of the ZrO 2 support became immediately apparent when it exhibited a higher conversion than the corresponding low-surface-area bulk Mo 2 C catalyst, which we attribute to lewis acid and base active sites on the surface of ZrO 2. From catalytic tests and pre-and <b>post-reaction</b> X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, we observed that different dispersions of the monometallic carbides, caused by varying the pre-heating temperatures on ZrO 2, did not significantly affect conversion or yield. In contrast, incorporation of cobalt atoms into the Mo 2 C lattice significantly enhanced the conversion, yield and stability of the catalysts. <b>Post-reaction</b> XRD patterns indicated that the bimetallic carbide had enhanced the resistance to the oxidation effect that is known to deactivate Mo 2 C catalysts. In addition, increasing the Co loading in the mixed metal carbides was seen to enhance the resistance of the catalyst to the reverse water gas shift reaction, leading to improved stability of the H 2 yields.|$|E

40|$|In the {{previous}} work of Mikosch et al. [Science 319, 183 (2008) ], ion imaging experiments {{were used to}} study the Cl- + CH 3 I -> ClCH 3 + 1 (-) reaction at collision energies E-rel of 0. 39, 0. 76, 1. 07, and 1. 9 eV. For the work reported here MP 2 (fc) /ECP/d direct dynamics simulations were performed to obtain an atomistic understanding of the experiments. There is good agreement with the experimental product energy and scattering angle distributions for the highest three E-rel, and at these energies 80 % {{or more of the}} reaction is direct, primarily occurring by a rebound mechanism with backward scattering. At 0. 76 eV there is a small indirect component, with isotropic scattering, involving formation of the pre- and <b>post-reaction</b> complexes. All of the reaction is direct at 1. 07 eV. Increasing E-rel to 1. 9 eV opens up a new indirect pathway, the roundabout mechanism. The product energy is primarily partitioned into relative translation for the direct reactions, but to CH 3 Cl internal energy for the indirect reactions. The roundabout mechanism transfers substantial energy to CH 3 Cl rotation. At E-rel = 0. 39 eV both the experimental product energy partitioning and scattering are statistical, suggesting the reaction is primarily indirect with formation of the pre-and <b>post-reaction</b> complexes. However, neither MP 2 nor BhandH/ECP/d simulations agree with experiment and, instead, give reaction dominated by direct processes as found for the higher collision energies. Decreasing the simulation Erel to 0. 20 eV results in product energy partitioning and scattering which agree with the 0. 39 eV experiment. The sharp transition from a dominant direct to indirect reaction as Erel is lowered from 0. 39 to 0. 20 eV is striking. The lack of agreement between the simulations and experiment for Erel = 0. 39 eV may result from a distribution of collision energies in the experiment and/or a shortcoming in both the MP 2 and BhandH simulations. Increasing the reactant rotational temperature from 75 to 300 K for the 1. 9 eV collisions, results in more rotational energy in the CH 3 Cl product and a larger fraction of roundabout trajectories. Even though a ClCH 3 -I(-) <b>post-reaction</b> complex is not formed and the mechanistic dynamics are not statistical, the roundabout mechanism gives product energy partitioning in approximate agreement with phase space theory.

The effect of the briquettes and briquette components on the fluidity of the industrial coal blends was investigated. It was found that biomass and non-coking coal produced a decrease in fluidity, whereas the binders increased it. The combined effect of both types of additive had the global effect of decreasing fluidity. Mixtures of the briquettes with the industrial coal blends were carbonized in a 17 kg movable wall oven in order to assess their influence on the quality of the cokes produced.

Work-up in chemical organic synthesis consists of a series of <b>post-reaction</b> operations designed using differential chemical properties to remove excess reagent or starting material, reagent products and, where possible reaction by-products. Careful consideration of <b>post-reaction</b> operations as a clean-up step can obviate the requirement for purification.
