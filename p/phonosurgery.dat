5000|$|Professional {{opinion is}} mixed {{regarding}} the use of vocal surgery. There is currently a lack of outcome data, particularly longitudinal data, for pitch-elevating surgery, and outcomes have not been well-monitored over time. Because of this, some SLPs do not think that <b>phonosurgery</b> is a viable treatment option. Others believe it is, and still others believe it should be considered only as a [...] "last resort" [...] after the desired pitch change has not been seen in therapy. Critics cite variability in outcome, lack of outcome data, and reported negative effects like compromised voice quality, decreased vocal loudness, adverse impact on swallowing/breathing, sore throat, wound infection, and scarring as reasons to avoid vocal surgery. Proponents argue that surgery may protect a person's voice from damage caused by repetitive strain to elevate pitch in therapy. Ultimately, the decision to undergo surgery is up to the patient, with input from a knowledgeable physician and SLP.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction : Although <b>Phonosurgery</b> {{has been}} the {{mainstay}} of treatment for benign vocal fold lesions for decades, advanced diagnostic modalities improved techniques of voice therapy and vocal hygiene have helped managing them in a more precise and better way. Objective : To study the role of phonomicrosurgery in benign vocal fold lesions. Methods : This prospective study was under taken in a tertiary health care centre {{for a period of}} one-year (October 2012)  to September 2013, thirty two patients had undergone <b>phonosurgery</b> for vocal fold polyps (n = 14), vocal fold cysts (n= 8), vocal fold nodules(n= 3), Sulcus vocalis (n= 2), vocal fold papilloma (n=l), vocal fold angioma (n=l), keratotic patch (n= 2)  and vocal fold oedema (n= 1).  Their average age was 41 years of which 62 % werewomenand 69 % were smokers. Postoperative voice therapy was given to sixteen patients. Post-operative clinical evaluation was available for data analysis in 30 patients (92 %). Voice quality was assessed using the voice handicap index- 10 questionaire (VHI- 10), direct laryngoscopy was performed pre & post-operatively and self-reported assessment. The median follow-up time was 4 months. Result : Thirty out of 32 patients showed objective improvement in fibreoptic laryngoscopy post treatment. Two patients were noncompliant to voice therapy and showed recurrence of their pathologies. Mean VHI 10 score showed significant improvement from 8 in the preoperative period to 3 in the postoperative period.

We histologically evaluated the effects of dexamethasone sodium phosphate infiltration on acute vocal fold wound healing in rabbits 3 and 7 days after surgically induced injury by quantification of the inflammatory reaction and collagen deposition. Methods: A standardized surgical incision was made in the vocal folds of 12 rabbits, and 0. 1 mL dexamethasone sodium phosphate (4 mg/mL) was injected into the left vocal fold. The right vocal fold was not injected and served as the control. The larynges were collected 3 and 7 days after surgery.

The roughness subscale in particular showed little change after therapy or surgery. Only small effects were observed in general health and mood measures. The results suggest that the use of a voice-specific questionnaire is essential for assessing the effectiveness of voice interventions. All three self-reported measures tested were capable of detecting change, and scores were highly correlated. On the basis of this evaluation of different measures 2 ̆ 7 sensitivities to change, there is no strong evidence to favour either the vocal performance questionnaire, the voice handicap index or the voice symptom scale...|$|E

PET/ CT aids in cancer diagnosis and follow up. otolaryngology improved a lot in last two decades. Stroboscopy: It is based on talbot law. According to it, physical images linger on retina for 0. 2 seconds after exposure. Therefore, sequential images produced at interval < 0. 2 seconds produce {{the illusion of a}} continuous image. It involves use of a strobe light which is linked to the frequency of the patient’s voice. When the patient utters a tone, the light strobes at a frequency that may be either identical to or close to the frequency of the voice detected. Using this frequency, the recording device can produce a set of rapidly produced still images which gives illusion of continuous motion. 1 Stroboscopy is used to assess vocal fold vibration patterns, mucosal pliability, underlying layered structure of vocal folds, and undersurface of vocal fold edges. It is particularly useful when assessing stiffness, scar or sub mucosal injury; detecting small vocal fold lesions; estimating the depth of invasion of a tumor; identifying Editorial Recent advances in otolaryngology- head & neck surgery asymmetric mass or tension; or determining the resumption of voicing activities after <b>phonosurgery.</b> 2 Laser in otolaryngology- head & neck surgery: Laser means light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. Lasers used in surgery amplify light and create coherent light beams that range from the infrared to ultraviolet part of spectrum. Lasers work on the theory of stimulated emission given b...|$|E
40|$|Voice Handicap Index of benign {{laryngeal}} disorders Introduction: The {{chance of}} developing a voice problem during life is about 30 %. Vocal problems can have major impact on {{quality of life and}} often occur in different domains. The Voice Handicap Index (VHI) is a voice-related quality of life instrument to measure the psychosocial impact of voice problems in the physical, emotional and functional domains. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the change of VHI after treatment in seven common benign laryngeal disorders at the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG). In addition, correlation between the three domains is calculated as well as the predictive diagnostic value of the VHI before treatment. Methods: Patients with voice problems referred to the special voice outpatient clinic of the UMCG underwent a multidimensional voice examination. Treatments used are <b>phonosurgery,</b> speech therapy, medical therapy and in some cases wait-and-see. VHI forms were completed before and three months after treatment. Data were analyzed by the t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, multinomial logistic regression and Pearson correlation. Differences in gender were tested by the Mann-Whitney U test. A p-value < 0. 05 was considered to be significant. From November 2006 until January 2012 143 patients were retrospectively included in this cohort study. Results: Women presented with voice problems at younger age (37. 0 years, SD 15. 8 vs. 46. 1 years, SD 16. 5, p= 0. 001). After treatment VHI improved for six diagnoses (cyst (p= 0. 001), polyp (p< 0. 000), unilateral vocal cord paralysis (p= 0. 001), Reinke edema (p= 0. 010), papillomatosis (p= 0. 001), nodules (p= 0. 002)). Sulcus glottidis did not change (p= 0. 897). Mean VHI after treatment was higher for females (p= 0. 021). There was no correlation between the total VHI and different diagnoses. The three domains were not independent. ...|$|E
