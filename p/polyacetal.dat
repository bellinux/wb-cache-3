Biodegradable systems present potential advantages regarding safety benefit apart from the possibility to use higher molecular weight (Mw) carriers allowing PK optimization, by exploiting the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) -mediated tumor targeting. Within this context, we previously designed pH-responsive polyacetalic systems, tert-polymers, where a drug with the adequate diol-functionality was incorporated within the polymer mainchain. The synthetic, non-steroidal estrogen, diethylstilboestrol (DES) clinically used for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer was chosen as drug. In order to improve the properties of this tert-polymer, novel polyacetalic systems as block-co-polymers, with more defined structure have been obtained. This second generation <b>polyacetals</b> allowed higher drug capacity than the tert-polymer, a biphasic DES release profile at acidic pH and due to its controlled amphiphilic character readily formed micelle-like structures in solution.

40|$|We {{report the}} first {{synthesis}} of hyperbranched <b>polyacetals</b> via a melt transacetalization polymerization process. The process proceeds via the self-condensation of an AB(2) type monomer carrying a hydroxyl group and a dimethylacetal unit; the continuous removal of low boiling methanol drives the equilibrium toward polymer formation. Because of the susceptibility of the acetal linkage to hydrolysis, the polymer degrades readily under mildly acidic conditions to yield the corresponding hydroxyl aldehyde {{as the primary}} product. Furthermore, because of the unique topology of hyperbranched structures, the rate of polymer degradation was readily tuned by changing just {{the nature of the}} end-groups alone; instead of the dimethylacetal bearing monomer, longer chain dialkylacetals (dibutyl and dihexyl) monomers yielded hyperbranched polymers carrying longer alkyl groups at their molecular periphery. The highly branched topology and the relatively high volume fraction of the terminal alkyl groups resulted in a significant lowering of the ingress rates of the aqueous reagents to the loci of degradation, and consequently the degradation rates of the polymers were dramatically influenced by the hydrophobic nature of the terminal alkyl substituents. The simple synthesis and easy tunability of the degradation rates make these materials fairly attractive candidates for use as degradable scaffolds...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Bronsted acid-catalyzed polytransacetalization of hydroxymethylbenzaldehyde dimethylacetal (1), {{a commercially}} {{available}} AB(2) -type monomer, led to hyperbranched <b>polyacetals</b> (HBPA's) {{with a degree}} of branching (DB) around 0. 5 by forming methanol as byproduct. In sharp contrast, the polyacetalization of the nonprotected homologue, namely, hydroxymethylbenzaldehyde (2), yielded HBPA's with DB = 1, by forming water as byproduct, under the same acidic conditions. This major difference arises from the instability of the initially formed hemiacetal intermediates, which react faster than aldehyde moieties, driving the polyacetalization toward the quantitative formation of dendritic acetal units. This represents a rare example of defect-free hyperbranched polymer synthesis utilizing a very simple AB(2) -type monomer. Bronsted acid catalysts included p-toluenesulfonic, camphorsulfonic, and pyridinium camphorsulfonic acids. Trapping of the water generated during polyacetalization of 2 was accomplished using molecular sieves regularly renewed, which allowed achieving polymers of relatively high molar masses. These HBPA's with DB = 1 featuring multiple aldehyde functions at their periphery were further derivatized into PEGylated HBPA's, using linear amino-terminated poly(ethylene oxide) s of different molar masses. This led to submicrometric sized HBPA's with a core shell architecture. Finally, HBPA derivatives could be readily hydrolyzed under acidic conditions (e. g., pH = 4), owing to the acid sensitivity of their constitutive acetal linkages...|$|R

The aim {{of our study}} was to use nuclear methods to prove the presence of <b>polyacetal</b> wear particles, to determine their morphology and to check their distribution in the tissues around loosend hip prosthetic components. Methods Tissue samples obtained during retrieval of 4 aseptic loosened primary hip prostheses with isoelastic stems made of <b>polyacetal</b> were subjected to nuclear analyses. Proton microbrobe method (mikro-PIXE) was used to prove the presence of <b>polyacetal</b> wear particles and to check for their morphology by detection of barium, which is molecularly in BaSO 4 embedded in <b>polyacetal.</b> Thermal neutron activation {{was used to determine}} distribution pattern of <b>polyacetal</b> wear in the peri-prosthetic tissues. Results Against expectations, <b>polyacetal</b> wear particles were found rather rare, larger than 100 µm and present in pseudo-membrane samples around the loosened stem, but virtual l y absent in tissues away from their origin. Concentration of BaSO 4 in <b>polyacetal</b> wear particles in pseudo-membrane samples was similar to the one in <b>polyacetal</b> coating (conc. Ba = 14217 µg/g and 14800 µg/g, respectively). Conclusion According to the results, the primary cause of the loosening of the isoelastic stems with <b>polyacetal</b> coating is most probably mechanical restlessness, which is responsible for local production of the large <b>polyacetal</b> wear particles responsible to accelerate the process of loosening.

In a retrospective study 70 patients with uncemented Lord prostheses were followed for nearly 10 years. Pain and radiological changes were recorded at 1 and 5 years and at the latest follow-up. Twenty-five patients (36 %) complained of thigh pain. Radiological changes interpreted asadaptive bone remodelling, progressed throughout the period of observation. Physically activepatients with thigh pain had less proximal bone loss than less active ones. New bone formationwas associated with radiolucencies at the mid-stem level indicating that the elastic relativedisplacement may contlibute to the pattern of bone remodelling seen with bulky uncementedimplants. Thigh pain was not associated with any particular radiographic changes. In a series of retrieved modular Lord prostheses discoloration and dark deposits at the head-neck junction was found in 4 of 9 cases. Metallographic analysis of retrieved implants revealedmaterial flaws close to the modular interfaces where severe corrosion had occurred. Bone andsoft tissues at the implant site were similarly discoloured by corrosion products. Metalpalticles were often found in areas ol extensive necrosis indicating a toxic reaction. Moreover,foreign-body granuloma and chronic inflammation were common findings, and in two caseswe observed obliterative vascular changes similar to those previously described with metal-to-metal prostheses.

40|$|Particles in {{the upper}} {{troposphere}} and lower stratosphere (UT/LS) consist mostly of concentrated sulfuric acid (40 – 80 wt%) in water. However, airborne measurements have shown that these particles also contain a significant fraction of organic compounds of unknown chemical composition. Acid-catalyzed reactions of carbonyl species {{are believed to be}} responsible for significant transfer of gas phase organic species into tropospheric aerosols and are potentially more important at the high acidities characteristic of UT/LS particles. In this study, experiments combining sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) with propanal and with mixtures of propanal with glyoxal and/or methylglyoxal at acidities typical of UT/LS aerosols produced highly colored surface films (and solutions) that may have implications for aerosol properties. In order to identify the chemical processes responsible for the formation of the surface films, attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) and 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies were used to analyze the chemical composition of the films. Films formed from propanal were a complex mixture of aldol condensation products, acetals and propanal itself. The major aldol condensation products were the dimer (2 -methyl- 2 -pentenal) and 1, 3, 5 -trimethylbenzene that was formed by cyclization of the linear aldol condensation trimer. Additionally, the strong visible absorption of the films indicates that higher-order aldol condensation products must also be present as minor species. The major acetal species were 2, 4, 6 -triethyl- 1, 3, 5 -trioxane and longer-chain linear <b>polyacetals</b> which are likely to separate from the aqueous phase. Films formed on mixtures of propanal with glyoxal and/or methylglyoxal also showed evidence of products of cross-reactions. Since cross-reactions would be more likely than self-reactions under atmospheric conditions, similar reactions of aldehydes like propanal with common aerosol organic species like glyoxal and methylglyoxal have the potential to produce significant organic aerosol mass and therefore could potentially impact chemical, optical and/or cloud-forming properties of aerosols, especially if the products partition to the aerosol surface...|$|R

40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that reduced stem stiffness of orthopaedic implants {{contributes to a}} high risk of loosening, since interface stresses and relative motions may exceed a tolerable range. To study this hypothesis, three types of load-bearing implant with different stiffnesses were inserted into the tibia of the goat. Histological analysis was performed of bone repair after insertion of the implant, bone ingrowth, interface disruption and loosening. A finite element model of the configuration provided the quantitative range of interface stresses and relative motions for the present experiment. The implants were made out of stainless steel, hollow titanium and a thin titanium core covered with a <b>polyacetal</b> coating. The stiffness ratios of these implants were approximately 10 : 4 : 1, respectively. All implants were coated with a layer of hydroxyapatite (HA) in order to minimize the possible biological effects of the different implant materials. Irrespective of the type of implant, there was a repair phase that lasted 6 - 12 weeks. The stiff implants functioned well. Large areas of bone bonding to the HA layer were found after the repair phase at 12 weeks postoperatively. After 24 weeks, some signs of loosening were observed. More loosening occurred with the hollow titanium and <b>polyacetal</b> implants, mainly during the repair phase. Three hollow titanium and three <b>polyacetal</b> coated implants survived this period, and were killed after 24 weeks. The integrity of the HA layer at the bone-implant interface of the titanium implants was good. In the <b>polyacetal</b> implants, the repair reaction of the cortical bone was incomplete. Bone ingrowth into HA was largely lacking. In conclusion, we found significant differences in the repair and interface reactions around implants of different stiffness. Stiff implants showed favourable initial interface conditions for bone ingrowth. Intermediate and flexible implants provoked unfavourable interface conditions for initial bone ingrowth. The finite element study showed that the flexible stems produce larger micromotions and higher interface stresses at the bone-prosthesis interface than the stiff stems, indicating an explanation for the histological findings.

In contrast to polychloral and polybromochloroacetaldehydes, which are wholly insoluble, it was found that under suitable conditions soluble polymers of relatively low molecular weight could be produced from DBFA, DCFA and CDFA, but not DBFA. ^ Most polymers were, however, insoluble, crystalline and presumably isotactic. Thermal stabilities of all polymers were found to be improved by treatment with either PCl(, 5) or acid anhydrides. Degradation was quantitative to monomer. Ceiling temperatures for the polymerizations were found to decrease with increasing bromine content and increase with fluorine content. Monomer boiling points varied in the reverse fashion. Relative polymerization rates were measured through copolymerization with chloral, with isocyanates and with one another. ^ In a separate set of experiments tetrachloroethylene oxide was synthesized by direct oxidation of tetrachloroethylene with oxygen in the presence of ultraviolet light. This preparation resulted in a mixture of tetrachloroethylene oxide and trichloroacetyl chloride in approximately equal amounts under the most favorable conditions. Tetrachloroethylene oxide rearranged readily to trichloroacetyl chloride above 60 (DEGREES) C. with an activation energy E(,a) of 3. 0 x 10 (2 ̆ 74) cal/mole and a pre-exponential factor A of 1. 9 x 10 (2 ̆ 713). All attempts to polymerizae tetrachloroethylene oxide under a variety of conditions failed. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} {{of the field of}} polymer science and the rise of plastics as ubiquitous materials in almost every aspect of our daily lives is one of the defining scientific achievements of the 20 th Century. Ironically, concerns with disposal of the ever-increasing amounts of plastics as well as uncertainty surrounding the future of petroleum-based chemical feedstocks have led 21 st Century scientists to investigate alternatives to these very same materials. Biodegradable polymers represent a way to continue the use of plastics in many applications without concerns about long-term accumulation. Additionally, biodegradable polymers offer many properties not found in traditional polymers, most notably their compatibility with biological systems, allowing them to act as ideal materials for biomedical research. This work focuses on new and efficient syntheses of biodegradable polymers, particularly through the use of catalysis. First, the synthesis of biodegradable cyclic polyketals was investigated in the hopes of generating high molecular weight materials. <b>Polyacetals</b> and polyketals are interesting alternatives to more established polyester-based biodegradable polymers in that they do not degrade to acidic species upon hydrolysis. Additionally, because polyketals are stable at neutral pH, but degrade quickly under mild acidic conditions, they are able to act as pH-sensitive materials. However, their syntheses are typically complicated and result in low molecular weight polymers, limiting their utility. Through the Lewis acid catalyzed intramolecular cyclization of epoxide-ketones, strained bicyclic ketals were generated that act as monomers for cationic polymerization. This methodology allowed the synthesis of polyketals with exceptionally high molecular weights. In addition to the study of ketal-based polymers, biodegradable polyesters were investigated. The synthesis of a new class of carboxylic acid-containing polyesters was developed via the self-condensation ring-opening polymerization of anhydridealcohols. These anhydride-alcohol monomers may be produced from catalytic carbonylation of epoxides, allowing a number of backbone functionalities to be generated for the tuning of properties. Polyhydroxyalkanoates, a well known class of biodegradable polyesters, were investigated through both the creation of new carbonylation catalysts for efficient synthesis of their !-lactone monomers as well as the creation of new catalysts for controlled !-lactone ring-opening polymerizations. Finally, unrelated to polymerization, the use of carbonylation for the catalytic synthesis of interesting materials...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{covers the}} design and testing of a three-axis {{computer}} numerical control (CNC) milling machine for machining <b>polyacetal</b> (POM) and other polymers. This study is relevant in today's trend, when technological devices are becoming personal (personal computers, personal 3 D printers, etc.). There are similar machines in the market, but specific studies on the structure rigidity and machining accuracy {{has not yet been}} carried out. The research results can be applied to further personal CNC milling machine development and production. This master's project aim is to create a programmable CNC machine prototype for <b>polyacetal</b> machining and to investigate the machine rigidity and accuracy. The paper provides an overview of <b>polyacetal,</b> its mechanical characteristics and comparison with other commonly used industrial materials characteristics. Review is continued on different machine components. Then the best machine structure type is selected and modeled within SolidWorks 2016 software. Simulations of the model are performed to back up the selected structure type. The designed machine is assembled and tested. The price for constructing the machine is compared with similar machines on sale. The study of the machine is begun by calculating cutting forces generated when machining <b>polyacetal</b> by nine different routing regimes. Then a simulation of the machine is performed and the result are compared with the experimentally retrieved data of the strain and deflection occurring during machining. A regression analysis is performed, which shows that the cutting feed rate has the largest effect on the machine structure deflection. With the nine different routing regimes a testing part is machines, for each regime and the accuracy of the machining is measured. The optimal regime is chosen according to the results. A graph showing the dependency of the nine regimes deflection and precision is constructed. With the optimal regime twenty same test parts are machined and measured for obtaining machine accuracy. Measurement and analysis results are presented graphically. At the end of the paper conclusions and improvements are presented...|$|E
