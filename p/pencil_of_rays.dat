In general, this is {{the angle of the}} real marginal ray in the system. Because {{the index of}} refraction is included, the NA of a <b>pencil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> is an invariant as a <b>pencil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> passes from one material to another through a flat surface.

40|$|Anisotropic Gaussian Schell-model (AGSM) {{fields and}} their {{transformation}} by first-order optical systems (FOS’s) forming Sp(4,R) are studied using the generalized <b>pencils</b> <b>of</b> <b>rays.</b> The fact that Sp(4,R), {{rather than the}} larger group SL(4,R), is the relevant group is emphasized. A convenient geometrical picture wherein AGSM fields and FOS’s are represented, respectively, by antisymmetric second-rank tensors and de Sitter transformations in a (3 + 2) -dimensional space is developed. These fields are shown to separate into two qualitatively different families of orbits and the invariants over each orbit, two in number, are worked out. We also develop another geometrical picture in a (2 + 1) -dimensional Minkowski space suitable for {{the description of the}} action of axially symmetric FOS’s on AGSM fields, and the invariants, now seven in number, are derived. Interesting limiting cases forming coherent and quasihomogeneous fields are analyzed...|$|R
50|$|From {{the front}} of the camera, the small hole (the {{aperture}}), would be seen. The virtual image of the aperture as seen from the world is known as the lens's entrance pupil; ideally, all <b>rays</b> <b>of</b> light leaving a point on the object that enter the entrance pupil will be focused to the same point on the image sensor/film (provided the object point is in the field of view). If one were inside the camera, one would see the lens acting as a projector. The virtual image of the aperture from inside the camera is the lens's exit pupil. In this simple case, the aperture, entrance pupil, and exit pupil are all in the same place because the only optical element is in the plane of the aperture, but in general these three will be in different places. Practical photographic lenses include more lens elements. The additional elements allow lens designers to reduce various aberrations, but the principle of operation remains the same: <b>pencils</b> <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> are collected at the entrance pupil and focused down from the exit pupil onto the image plane.|$|R

[...] But the context shows clearly that perspective painting must be meant, for Vitruvius {{goes on to say}} that Democritus and Anaxagoras, carrying out the principles laid down in a treatise written by Agatharchus, wrote on the same subject, showing how, in drawing, the lines ought to be made to correspond, according to a natural proportion, to the figure which would be traced out on an imaginary intervening plane by a <b>pencil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> proceeding from the eye, as a fixed point of sight, to the several points of the object viewed.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{discrete}} framework for 3 D wave propagation to support morphological computations {{with an emphasis}} on the recovery of the medial axis of a 3 D solid, a collection of surface patches, or a data set of unorganized points. The wave propagation is implemented on a discrete lattice, where initial surfaces are considered as sources of propagation. Three classes <b>of</b> discrete <b>rays</b> are designed to cover the propagation space with a minimal number <b>of</b> computations. These <b>pencils</b> <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> represent a ``compromise'' view between Huygens and Fermat principles. The 3 D medial axis points mare then found at the collision of wavefronts. This method has linear time complexity in the number of nodes of the lattice used to discretize the propagation medium, i. e., it is independent of the topological complexity of the initial data. As such, it is highly efficient for the extraction of symmetries, as well as for implementing 3 D morphological filters based on erosions and dilations, from large 3 D data sets. The wave propagation scheme permits to implement the effect of various metrics including the Euclidean one...|$|R

5000|$|An {{article in}} the Quarterly Journal of Science, Literature, and The Arts (1821) raised some {{interest}} in optical illusions of curved spokes in rotating wheels seen through vertical apertures. In 1824 Peter Mark Roget provided mathematical details about the appearing curvatures and added the observation that the spokes appeared motionless. Roget claimed that the illusion {{is due to the}} fact “that an impression made by a <b>pencil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> on the retina, if sufficiently vivid, will remain for a certain time after the cause has ceased.” [...] This was later seen as the basis for the theory of [...] "persistence of vision" [...] as the principle of how we see film as motion rather than the successive stream of still images actually presented to the eye. This theory has been discarded as the (sole) principle of the effect since 1912, but remains in many film history explanations. However, Roget's experiments and explanation did inspire some further research by Michael Faraday and also by Joseph Plateau that would eventually bring about the invention of animation.|$|E
5000|$|In 1821 the Quarterly Journal of Science, Literature, and The Arts {{published}} a [...] "letter to the editor" [...] {{with the title}} Account of an Optical Deception. It was dated Dec. 1, 1820 and attributed to [...] "J.M.", possibly publisher/editor John Murray himself. The author noted that the spokes of a rotating wheel seen through fence slats appeared with peculiar curvatures (see picture). The letter concluded: [...] "The general principles on which this deception is based will, immediately occur to your mathematical readers, but a perfect demonstration will probably prove less easy than it appears on first sight". Four years later Peter Mark Roget offered an explanation when reading at the Royal Society on December 9, 1824. He added: “It is also to be noticed that, however rapidly the wheel revolves, each individual spoke, during the moment it is viewed, appears to be at rest." [...] Roget claimed that the illusion {{is due to the}} fact “that an impression made by a <b>pencil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> on the retina, if sufficiently vivid, will remain for a certain time after the cause has ceased.” He also provided mathematical details about the appearing curvatures.|$|E
5000|$|The Stoics {{explained}} perception as {{a transmission}} of the perceived quality of an object, {{by means of the}} sense organ, into the percipient's mind. The quality transmitted appears as a disturbance or impression upon the corporeal surface of that [...] "thinking thing," [...] the soul. In the example of sight, a conical <b>pencil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> diverges from the pupil of the eye, so that its base covers the object seen. A presentation is conveyed, by an air-current, from the sense organ, here the eye, to the mind, i.e. the soul's [...] "ruling part." [...] The presentation, besides attesting its own existence, gives further information of its object - such as colour or size. Zeno and Cleanthes compared this presentation to the impression which a seal bears upon wax, while Chrysippus determined it more vaguely as a hidden modification or mode of mind. But the mind is no mere passive recipient of impressions from without. Sensation reacts, by a variation in tension, against the current from the sense-organ; and this is the mind's assent or dissent, which is inseparable from the sense presentation. The contents of experience are not all true or valid: hallucination is possible; here the Stoics agreed with the Epicureans. It is necessary, therefore, that assent should not be given indiscriminately; we must determine a criterion of truth, a special formal test whereby reason may recognize the merely plausible and hold fast the true.|$|E
40|$|Abstract A large {{class of}} visual {{systems in the}} {{biological}} world often has multiple eyes in simultaneous motion and yet {{has little or no}} overlap in the visual fields between the eyes. These systems include the lateral eyes found in many vertebrates and the compound eyes in insects. Instead of computing feature correspondences between the eyes, which might not even be possible {{due to the lack of}} overlap in the visual fields, we exploit the organizational possibility of-fered by the eye topography. In particular, we leverage on the pair <b>of</b> visual <b>rays</b> that are parallel to each other but opposite in direction, and compute what we call the quasi-parallax for translation recovery. Besides resulting in parsi-monious visual processing, the quasi-parallax term also en-hances the information pick-up for the translation, as it is almost rotation-free. The rotation is subsequently recovered from a <b>pencil</b> <b>of</b> visual <b>rays</b> using the individual epipolar constraints of each camera. As a result of using these dif-ferent and appropriate aspects <b>of</b> visual <b>rays</b> for motion re-covery, our method is numerically more effective in disam-biguating the translation and rotation. In comparison to the gold standard solution obtained by the bundle adjustment (BA) technique, our method has a better Fisher information matrix for a lateral eye pair, as well as a superior experimen-tal performance under the case of narrow field of view.

Those that impinge on the lens will be brought to a focus on S, where a bright speck of light might be seen. This speck radiates light in all direction; some <b>of</b> the <b>rays,</b> proceeding from it, impinge on the lens at the other hole in the shade K, as shown in fig. 2, and are reduced by its agency to parallelism with r' and R', that is, with the rays that originally left the mirror: consequently E, looking partly {{at the edge of the}} lens, and partly into space, sees a bright speck of light in the former, coincident with the point O in the latter.|$|R

5000|$|A point O (fig. 2) at {{a finite}} {{distance}} from the axis (or with an infinitely distant object, a point which subtends a finite angle at the system) is, in general, even then not sharply reproduced if the <b>pencil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> issuing from it and traversing the system is made infinitely narrow by reducing the aperture stop; such a pencil consists of the rays which can pass from the object point through the now infinitely small entrance pupil. It is seen (ignoring exceptional cases) that the pencil {{does not meet the}} refracting or reflecting surface at right angles; therefore it is astigmatic (Gr. a-, privative, stigmia, a point). Naming the central ray passing through the entrance pupil the axis of the pencil or principal ray, it can be said: the rays of the pencil intersect, not in one point, but in two focal lines, which can be assumed to be at right angles to the principal ray; of these, one lies in the plane containing the principal ray and the axis of the system, i.e. in the first principal section or meridional section, and the other at right angles to it, i.e. in the second principal section or sagittal section. We receive, therefore, in no single intercepting plane behind the system, as, for example, a focusing screen, an image of the object point; on the other hand, in each of two planes lines O' and O" [...] are separately formed (in neighboring planes ellipses are formed), and in a plane between O' and O" [...] a circle of least confusion. The interval O'O", termed the astigmatic difference, increases, in general, with the angle W made by the principal ray OP with the axis of the system, i.e. with the field of view. Two astigmatic image surfaces correspond to one object plane; and these are in contact at the axis point; on the one lie the focal lines of the first kind, on the other those of the second. Systems in which the two astigmatic surfaces coincide are termed anastigmatic or stigmatic.|$|E

40|$|That a thin refracting element {{can have}} a dioptric power which is {{asymmetric}} immediately raises questions at the fundamentals of linear optics.   In optometry the important concept of vergence, in particular, depends {{on the concept of}} a <b>pencil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> which in turn depends on the existence of a focus.   But systems that contain refracting elements of asymmetric power may have no focus at all.   Thus the existence of thin systems with asym-metric power forces one to go back to basics and redevelop a linear optics from scratch that is sufficiently general to be able to accommodate such systems.   This paper offers an axiomatic approach to such a generalized linear optics.   The paper makes use of two axioms: (i) a ray in a homogeneous medium is a segment of a straight line, and (ii) at an interface between two homogeneous media a ray refracts according to Snell’s equation.   The familiar paraxial assumption of linear optics is also made.   From the axioms a <b>pencil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> at a transverse plane T in a homogeneous medium is defined formally (Definition 1) as an equivalence relation with no necessary association with a focus.   At T the reduced inclination of a ray in a pencil is an af-fine function of its transverse position.   If the pencilis centred the function is linear.   The multiplying factor M, called the divergency of the pencil at T, is a real  2 2 ×  matrix.   Equations are derived for the change of divergency across thin systems and homogeneous gaps.   Although divergency is un-defined at refracting surfaces and focal planes the <b>pencil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> is defined at every transverse plane ina system (Definition 2).   The eigenstructure gives aprincipal meridional representation of divergency;and divergency can be decomposed into four natural components.   Depending on its divergency a pencil in a homogeneous gap may have exactly one point focus, one line focus, two line foci or no foci. Equations are presented for the position of a focusand of its orientation {{in the case of a}} line focus.   All possible cases are examined.   The equations allow matrix step-along procedures for optical systems in general including those with elements that haveasymmetric power.   The negative of the divergencyis the (generalized) vergence of the pencil. </p...|$|E

On the basis of these shape parameters, we discuss a setting of image distortion in a generic (exact) spacetime, in the form of three distortion parameters. The fundamental tool in our discussion is the use of geodesic deviation fields along a null geodesic to study how source shapes are propagated and distorted on the path to an observer. We illustrate this non-perturbative treatment of image distortion in the case of lensing by a Schwarzschild black hole. We conclude by showing that there is a non-perturbative generalization of the use of Fermat's principle in lensing in the thin-lens approximation. Comment: 22 pages, 6 figures, to appear in Phys.
