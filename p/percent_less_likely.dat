2500|$|An {{economist}} at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, British Columbia who makes ties between same-sex parenting and childhood instability {{by looking at}} couples from unstable homes and comparing them {{to those who have}} been raised consistently by two heterosexual parents. Allen takes a 2010 study by Michael Rosenfeld - who testified for the plaintiffs, and re-examines it by adding in the outliers. [...] "We re-examine Rosenfeld's (2010) study on the association between child outcomes and same-sex family structure. Using the same data set, we replicate and generalize Rosenfeld's findings and show that the implications of his study are different when using either alternative comparison groups or alternative sample restrictions. Compared with traditional married households, we find that children being raised by same-sex couples are 35 <b>percent</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to make normal progress through school; this difference is statistically significant at the one percent level," [...] states the brief for Allen's report. Signed onto an amicus brief with both Price and Regnerus urging the Supreme Court to uphold California’s Proposition 8. Allen was the defense's final witness and testified on March 6, 2014 that the state [...] "should be very cautious in making such a fundamental change to such a fundamental institution when there really isn’t any evidence on the child outcomes." [...] Allen argued that although U.S. psychology and sociology organizations have expressed consensus opinions that children of same-sex couples suffer no measurable disadvantages, conflicting results and limited data show that there's no such certainty on the matter. While maintaining he has no bias, he admitted that his religious views lead him to believe that homosexual acts are grounds for being sent to Hell.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} labor market opportunities on schoolingemployment decisions in 12 urban areas in Argentina over 12 years, emphasizing the recession/crisis years 1998 - 2002. Over “typical” years deteriorating job rates increase the probability of attending school and decrease the probability of combining work and school, particularly for boys; the probability of being in school for secondary school children was about 6 percent higher in 2002 than in 1998. These estimates account {{for the fact that}} a new Federal Education Law (FEL) in 1996 extended mandatory education to 10 years. Differences across regions in implementation and differences in exposure across cohorts induced by the timing of the Law reveal that children in provinces fully implementing the FEL were 3 percent more likely to be in school and 1. 6 <b>percent</b> points <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to be working. schooling decision, macroeconomic shocks, education policy...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} to improve the recruitment, training, and retention of epidemiologists in the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) Program of the Centers for Disease Control. The authors compared minority graduates {{of the program and}} nonminority graduates in several areas: reasons for application, degree of satisfaction, appropriateness of preparation for epidemiologic practice, and current professional activities. A closed-ended questionnaire was mailed to all 87 minority graduates from the program during the period 1970 - 88, and to 172 randomly selected nonminority graduates. Of 259 graduates surveyed, 234 or 90. 3 percent returned the questionnaire [...] 89. 6 percent of minority graduates and 90. 7 percent of nonminority graduates. Virtually all graduates were satisfied with their EIS experience (95. 2 percent), have encouraged others to apply (96. 1 percent), and are the most frequent sources of initial contact of prospective officers (38. 2 percent). Most EIS graduates (71. 2 percent) were still working in epidemiology. Compared with the nonminority graduates, the minority graduates {{were more likely to be}} women and to be single. Minority graduates were <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> than nonminorities to hold academic appointments (44. 2 percent versus 60. 0 <b>percent)</b> and <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to work in academic settings as their primary job (11. 5 percent versus 18. 7 percent). At the same time, minority graduates were more likely to have learned of the EIS Program from academic advisors (32. 1 percent versus 19. 4 percent). Graduates express high levels of satisfaction with the EIS Program and continue to practice epidemiology following graduation. Few differences between the minority and nonminority graduates were found. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether there would be racial and ethnic disparities in meeting eligibility criteria for medication therapy management (MTM) services implemented in 2006 for Medicare beneficiaries. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Secondary data analyses of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2004 - 2005). STUDY DESIGN: Logistic regression and recycled predictions were {{used to test the}} disparities in meeting eligibility criteria across racial and ethnic groups. The eligibility thresholds used by health plans in 2006 and new thresholds recommended for 2010 were examined. Racial and ethnic disparities were examined by comparing non-Hispanic blacks (blacks) with non-Hispanic whites (whites) and comparing Hispanics with whites, respectively. Disparities were also examined among individuals with severe health problems. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: According to 2006 thresholds, the adjusted odds ratios for meeting eligibility criteria for blacks and Hispanics to whites were 0. 36 - 0. 60 (p<. 05) and 0. 13 - 0. 46 (p<. 05), respectively. Blacks and Hispanics would be 21 - 34 and 32 - 38 <b>percent,</b> respectively, <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to be eligible than whites according to recycled predictions. Similar patterns were found using the 2010 eligibility thresholds and among individuals with severe health problems. CONCLUSIONS: There would be racial and ethnic disparities in meeting MTM eligibility criteria. Future research is warranted to confirm the findings using data after MTM implementation...|$|R

50|$|Many {{members of}} the public {{continue}} to hold a perception that police in America do not properly exercise uses of force. Many uses of force have been sensationalized by the media.

Steps to help aid in the prevention of excessive force {{can be as simple as}} increased education, improved officer training, better public awareness of how to interact with the police, and through officers gaining experience. It has been shown that officers who have two years or more of college education are 30 <b>percent</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to shoot a civilian than an officer with less than 2 years of college education (Chapman 423). Police-worn body cameras also allow both the officer and the citizen in a citizen-police use of force interaction to be held to account, with an accurate (though often incomplete, due to the limitations of field of view and sometimes poor audio recording), unbiased video recording of the event.

5000|$|Mothers {{are less}} likely to get hired than non-mothers. Correll, Benard, and Paik created a study that looked at the hiring {{practices}} and preferences of employers. They created hypothetical job seekers with resumes and other materials. 192 Cornell undergraduates were asked to evaluate them as candidates for a position as marketing director for a start-up communications company. They created two applicant profiles that were functionally equivalent. Their resumes were both very strong; they were very successful in their last jobs. When presenting these resumes, no one preferred one applicant over the other and they were seen as equally qualified. Next, a memo mentioning that the applicant was a mother of two children was added to one of the profiles. The resume was also modified to show that the applicant was an officer in a parent-teacher association. This time when participants were asked if they would hire these applicants, participants said they would hire 84 percent of the women without children, compared with only 47 percent of the mothers. These findings showed that mothers are 79 <b>percent</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to be hired.
