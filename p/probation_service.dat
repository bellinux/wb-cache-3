500|$|Davis {{also noted}} the unusual {{situation}} in that [...] "a gang was involved and that two females were the sadistic leaders." [...] Following the convictions of Powell and McNeilly, there was wider press speculation about [...] "girl gangs" [...] {{and the rise}} in violent crime committed by young women, and [...] "the <b>probation</b> <b>service</b> and ex-offender organisations found themselves bombarded with requests from journalists seeking out case histories to illustrate this apparent explosion of LA-style girl-gang culture {{on the streets of}} Britain." [...] Mary Barnish, a senior probation officer at the Inner London <b>Probation</b> <b>Service</b> Women's Centre, dismissed the notion, saying: [...] "One woman does something somewhere and immediately there's a great moral panic. People think there's an epidemic of it." [...] However, statistics and research produced by the National Association of Probation Officers did show [...] "an {{increase in the number of}} women jailed for offences involving violence." [...] The association's assistant general secretary Harry Fletcher said that, like the women involved in the Capper murder, the group is [...] "characterised by neglect, personal abuse, drug or alcohol abuse and low self-esteem. Many have themselves been the victim of violence. The problem needs help rather than incarceration." [...] In one of the [...] "starkest signs of change" [...] there was evidence that [...] "in the 15—17 age group, girls are more likely to take pleasure in violence than boys, an indication we may face far more female violence in the future as these girls grow up." [...] Despite the focus on the female perpetrators around the time of the crime and trial Davis pointed out that, in cases like this which involved female and male sadists, [...] "the female's role is invariably forgotten over time. This was apparent when Dudson's appeals were reported in the national press. Manchester newspapers named all of the killers involved, but most less-localised reports simply referred to the 'violent gang' he belonged to, and it probably wouldn't have occurred to newer readers that this gang included two merciless female sadists who thought that an allegedly stolen duffle coat was an excuse to torture someone to death." ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} the recent partial privatisation of <b>probation</b> <b>services</b> in England and Wales from the theoretical perspective of legitimacy. Drawing in particular on Beetham's (1991) work, {{we argue that}} the question of legitimacy in respect of privatised <b>probation</b> <b>services</b> is a complex one which requires attention to the multiple – and different – perspectives of key stakeholders or constituencies in the probation field. We argue that in the probation context there are five key stakeholder groups: the general public; offenders and victims; ministers and civil servants; sentencers; and probation employees and their representatives. We consider what is known about the perspectives of each of these groups in turn, before concluding that privatised <b>probation</b> <b>services</b> {{need to be aware of}} both the legitimacy deficits they face and the complex dynamics likely to be involved in its cultivation with these different constituencies. ...|$|R
