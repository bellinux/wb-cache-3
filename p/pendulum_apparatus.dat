40|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, only <b>pendulum</b> <b>apparatuses</b> and torsion {{balances}} were available for general exploration work. Both of these early techniques were cumbersome and time-consuming. It was no wonder that the development of the gravity meter was welcomed with a universal sigh of relief. By 1935 potential field measurements with gravity meters supplanted gradient measurements with torsion balances. Potential field measurements are generally characterized by three types: absolute - measurements are made in fundamental units, traceable to national standards of length and time at each observation site; relative with absolute scale - differences in gravity are measured in fundamental units traceable to national standards of length and time; and relative - differences in gravity are measured with arbitrary scale. Improvements in the design of gravity meters since their introduction has led to a significant reduction in size and greatly increased precision. As the precision increased, applications expanded to include the measurement of crustal motion, the search for non-Newtonian forces, archeology, and civil engineering. Apart from enhancements to the astatic gravity meter, few developments in hardware were achieved. One of these was the vibrating string gravity meter which was developed in the 1950 s and was employed briefly for marine and borehole applications. Another is the cryogenic gravity meter which utilizes the stability of superconducting current to achieve a relative instrument with extremely low drift suitable for tidal and secular gravity measurements. An advance in performing measurements from a moving platform was achieved with the development of the straight-line gravity meter. The latter part of the century also saw the rebirth of gradient measurements which offers advantages for observations from a moving platform.

40|$|Considerable demand {{exists for}} {{a device to}} {{facilitate}} hands-free, stable stance in individuals with neurological disorders such as spinal cord injury (SCI) and stroke. In this regard, applying functional electrical stimulation (FES) to muscles of the lower limbs in closed loop has shown promise. In particular, {{it has been suggested}} that a PID control strategy could offer functional benefits to stability by mimicking the neurological control strategy employed in able-bodied stance. In this proof of concept study, we tested this assertion by examining the potential of a PID control strategy with gravity compensation to effectively maintain balance during quiet stance by regulating FES-induced contractions of the ankle plantarflexors and dorsiflexors in able-bodied individuals. A novel Inverted <b>Pendulum</b> Standing <b>Apparatus</b> (IPSA) was employed to simulate quiet stance whilst minimizing the voluntary control of able-bodied subjects. Quiet and perturbed standing trials were performed in 3 able-bodied subjects.

For all 3 subjects and for all of the metrics examined, our results showed that the proposed closed-loop controlled FES system improved performance in comparison to voluntary control. These results indicate that the PID plus gravity control strategy used in this study offers meaningful benefits over voluntary control in terms of standing stability. Thus, the controller could potentially be applied to the problem of improving or restoring standing ability in some neurologic patient populations...|$|R

MyRIO provides a perfect platform for Industrial Computer System Engineering students to expand what they have learned throughout their degree. National Instruments has dedicated a lot of their resources to improve and provide support for their hardware. MyRIO makes it much easier to learn, understand and implement projects in such a short period. A lot of help is provided in various ways, such as inbuilt, online and learning sessions to improve the understanding of the device. The main objectives of the thesis project involve learning and understanding the MyRIO device, creating learning guides to future students and integrate the device into an existing embedded application. This report describes the hardware and software capabilities of MyRIO and how to integrate the device to control an inverted pendulum. The inverted <b>pendulum</b> <b>apparatus</b> is at Engineering and Energy Building 220 at Murdoch University. The device itself has been constructed from an old sliding door mechanism. There are a few sensors integrated into the apparatus to feedback information, such as an "Absolute Encoder" and "Incremental Encoder". The first part of the thesis is dedicated to understanding the various components and how they work. This gives {{a better understanding of the}} broader picture rather than isolating the issues. An Inverted pendulum dynamic model is derived. The dynamic model is used to design and simulate the Linear Quadratic Regulator controller in Matlab.

40|$|Closed-loop {{controlled}} functional {{electrical stimulation}} (FES) {{applied to the}} lower limb muscles {{can be used as}} a neuroprosthesis for standing balance in neurologically impaired individuals. The objective of this study was to propose a methodology for designing a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for FES applied to the ankle muscles toward maintaining standing balance for several minutes and in the presence of perturbations. First, a model of the physiological control strategy for standing balance was developed. Second, the parameters of a PID controller that mimicked the physiological balance control strategy were determined to stabilize the human body when modeled as an inverted pendulum. Third, this PID controller was implemented using a custom-made Inverted <b>Pendulum</b> Standing <b>Apparatus</b> that eliminated the effect of visual and vestibular sensory information on voluntary balance control. Using this setup, the individual-specific FES controllers were tested in able-bodied individuals and compared with disrupted voluntary control conditions in four experimental paradigms: (i) quiet-standing; (ii) sudden change of targeted pendulum angle (step response); (iii) balance perturbations that simulate arm movements; and (iv) sudden change of targeted angle of a pendulum with individual-specific body-weight (step response). In paradigms (i) to (iii), a standard 39. 5 -kg pendulum was used, and 12 subjects were involved. In paradigm (iv) 9 subjects were involved. Across the different experimental paradigms and subjects, the FES-controlled and disrupted voluntarily-controlled pendulum angle showed root mean square errors of < 1. 2 and 2. 3 deg, respectively. The root mean square error (all paradigms), rise time, settle time, and overshoot [paradigms (ii) and (iv) ] in FES-controlled balance were significantly smaller or tended to be smaller than those observed with voluntarily-controlled balance, implying improved steady-state and transient responses of FES-controlled balance. At the same time, the FES-controlled balance required similar torque levels (no significant difference) as voluntarily-controlled balance. The implemented PID parameters were to some extent consistent among subjects for standard weight conditions and did not require prolonged individual-specific tuning. The proposed methodology can be used to design FES controllers for closed-loop controlled neuroprostheses for standing balance. Further investigation of the clinical implementation of this approach for neurologically impaired individuals is needed...|$|R

The first successful measurements at sea were made in 1923 by Vening Meinesz in the Netherlands using the <b>pendulum</b> <b>apparatus</b> installed in a submarine. However, the gravity measurements using a submarine are not convenient because the access to a submarine is limited. Professor Chuji Tsuboi made a number of unsuccessful attempts at developing a gravity meter that can be operated on a normal surface ship by reducing the noise by minimizing the motion of the gravity meter through a mechanical design. I have chosen a new approach toward the measurements of gravity on a surface ship by simplifying the mechanical part using a string gravity meter that was installed directly on a vertical gyroscope in combination with the numerical and/or electronic reduction of noises. With this gravity meter TSSG (Tokyo Surface Ship Gravity Meter), we firstly succeeded in measuring gravity at sea onboard a surface ship in July 1961 and the measurements have been extended to the northwestern Pacific and beyond. The results reveal the fine structures of gravity field in and around trenches that provide important clues as to a number of geodynamic issues including the nature of the trench-trench interaction and the interaction of trenches with seamounts...|$|E
