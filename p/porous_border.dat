According to Georgescu-Roegen, their plan also involved Pătrășcanu, who had fallen out with his communist partners. Seizing his last opportunity just before the communist regime took over, Manuilă appealed to the anti-communist resistance figure Silviu Craciunas, who ran a people-smuggling operation. Using this channel, and with assistance from three Jewish anticommunists (Lola Roth and the brothers Leibovici), Manuilă crossed the <b>porous</b> <b>border</b> into the Hungarian Republic.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I will analyse the moral tenability of open and closed borders to immigrants. I {{will present the}} strongest reasons for open borders: freedom, moral equality, no {{coercion}} without democratic justification and improvement of life conditions. And I will present the best arguments for closed borders: the self-determination argument and the functioning society argument. I will show that the culture and freedom of association versions of the self-determination argument and the indirect cosmopolitanism version of the functioning society argument do not hold, while the democracy version of the self-determination argument and the economy and security versions of the functioning society argument do hold. I will defend that <b>porous</b> <b>borders</b> – borders that are partially open and partially closed – are the best option. Furthermore, I will give an indication on some broad guidelines and criteria that may count as a minimum standard to which states need to adapt their immigration policy. I will illustrate to what extent states already incorporate this by comparing these guidelines and criteria with the Dutch immigration policy. I will conclude with the claim that states that have a <b>porous</b> <b>borders</b> policy need to fulfil some global moral duties toward, between others, third world countries, {{in order to make}} the <b>porous</b> <b>borders</b> option morally defensible...|$|R

Sudan and Libya have had a complicated and frequently antagonistic relationship for many years. President Bashir said the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), a Darfuri rebel group, had attacked Khartoum three years ago using Libyan trucks, equipment, arms, ammunition and money. He said God had given Sudan a chance to respond, by sending arms, ammunition and humanitarian support to the Libyan revolutionaries. [...] "Our God, high and exalted, from above the seven skies, gave us the opportunity to reciprocate the visit," [...] he said. [...] "The forces which entered Tripoli, part of their arms and capabilities, were 100% Sudanese," [...] he told the crowd. His speech was well received by a large crowd in the eastern Sudanese town of Kassala. But the easy availability of weapons in Libya, and that country's <b>porous</b> <b>border</b> with Darfur, are also of great concern to the Sudanese authorities.|$|E

This thesis explores how <b>porous</b> <b>borders</b> have exacerbated terrorism in Uganda. Since the last terrorist attack in 2010 by Al Shaabab, Uganda has not experienced a significant terrorist incident. Still, the threat remains real and constant {{because of the}} situations on Uganda’s <b>porous</b> <b>borders.</b> For example, the Allied Democratic Front (ADF) terrorists still operate cells in the country, and the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) poses a threat from across the South Sudan–DRC–Uganda border. This thesis looks at how Uganda’s law enforcement agencies secure the country without undermining legitimate economic and social activities conducted through the <b>borders.</b> Because <b>porous</b> <b>borders</b> are, by definition, an international concern, this study also explores the regional cooperation and coordination mechanisms in place between Uganda and its regional partners on the one hand, and between Uganda {{and the international community}} on the other hand. Ultimately, the study finds that, given Uganda’s geopolitical location as a land-locked country, the borders will remain more or less porous. The way forward is to evolve systems that will manage this porosity to the benefit of law and order in Uganda. Colonel, Uganda Arm...|$|R
