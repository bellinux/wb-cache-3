5000|$|Natamycin was {{originally}} named <b>pimaricin</b> to honor Pietermartizburg, where Streptomyces natalensis was acquired. <b>Pimaricin</b> was later renamed natamycin after the World Health Organization (WHO) mandated that antibiotics produced by Streptomyces end in -mycin. The name {{also related to}} the organism producing the compound, Streptomyces natalensis, hence the name natamycin.|$|E
50|$|Streptomyces chattanoogensis is a {{bacterium}} species from the genus of Streptomyces {{which has been}} isolated from soil in Tennessee in the United States. Streptomyces chattanoogensis produces natamycin, <b>pimaricin</b> and tennecetin.|$|E
50|$|Natamycin, {{also known}} as <b>pimaricin</b> and {{sometimes}} sold as Natacyn, is a naturally occurring antifungal agent produced during fermentation by the bacterium Streptomyces natalensis, commonly found in soil. Natamycin has a very low solubility in water; however, natamycin is effective at very low levels. Its minimum inhibitory concentration is less than 10 ppm for most molds. Natamycin is classified as a macrolide polyene antifungal, and as a drug, is used to treat fungal keratitis, an infection of the eye. It is especially effective against Aspergillus and Fusarium corneal infections. Other common members of the polyene macrolide antifungal family are amphotericin B, nystatin, and filipin. Natamycin is also used in the food industry as a natural preservative.|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{gene cluster}} {{responsible}} for <b>pimaricin</b> biosynthesis in Streptomyces natalensis contains a cholesterol oxidase-encoding gene (pimE) surrounded by genes involved in <b>pimaricin</b> production. Gene-inactivation and -complementation experiments revealed that pimE encodes a functional cholesterol oxidase and, surprisingly, {{that it is}} also involved in <b>pimaricin</b> biosynthesis. This extracellular enzyme was purified from S. natalensis culture broths to homogeneity, and it was shown to restore <b>pimaricin</b> production when added to the mutant culture broths. Other cholesterol oxidases also triggered <b>pimaricin</b> production, suggesting that these enzymes could act as signaling proteins for polyene biosynthesis. This finding constitutes the description of a cholesterol oxidase gene with an involvement in antibiotic biosynthesis, and it broadens {{the scope of the}} biological functions for this type of oxidase...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Pimaricin-loaded poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) nanohydrogels {{with and}} without acrylic acid, were {{evaluated}} as food-spoilage inhibitors in a model system and a real food product: grape juice. <b>Pimaricin</b> was proposed as a non-allergenic alternative to sulphites for protecting juices against recontamination. However, <b>pimaricin</b> may degrade under con-ditions and treatments (heating, acidification, lighting) com-monly applied in producing fresh juices. Nanohydrogel en-capsulation may be a feasible procedure to avoid <b>pimaricin</b> degradation, improving its antimicrobial activity.

In some cases, the inhibition was extended even further than using free <b>pimaricin.</b> For in-stance, in the food model system, pimaricin-loaded nanohydrogels with acrylic acid (NPPNIPA- 20 AA(5)) prevented the yeast growth for more than 81 h while free <b>pimaricin</b> was only effective for 12 h.

40|$|Sequencing of the DNA {{region on}} the left fringe of the <b>pimaricin</b> gene cluster {{revealed}} {{the presence of a}} 579 bp gene, pimM, whose deduced product (192 aa) was found to have amino acid sequence homology with bacterial regulatory proteins. Database comparisons revealed that PimM combines an N-terminal PAS domain with a C-terminal helix–turn–helix (HTH) motif of the LuxR type. Gene replacement of pimM from the Streptomyces natalensis chromosome with a mutant version lacking the HTH DNA-binding domain resulted in complete loss of <b>pimaricin</b> production, suggesting that PimM is a positive regulator of <b>pimaricin</b> biosynthesis. Complementation of the DpimM mutant with a single copy of pimM integrated into the chromosome restored <b>pimaricin</b> production. The insertion of a single copy of pimM, with its own promoter, into the S. natalensis wild-type strain boosted <b>pimaricin</b> production. Gene expression analyses in S. natalensis wild-type and DpimM by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) of the <b>pimaricin</b> gene cluster revealed the targets for the PimM regulatory protein. According to these analyses, the genes responsible for initiation and first elongation cycles of polyketide chain extension are among the major targets for regulation. Other pim genes are differentially affected. Interestingly, our results indicate that PimM plays its regulatory role independently of PimR, the first pathway-specific regulator of <b>pimaricin</b> biosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|Exposure of washed {{cells of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae C- 299 to {{inhibitory}} concentrations of <b>pimaricin</b> decreased resistance to lethal temperatures and to freezing and thawing.

Addition of peptone or calcium ion to the heating menstruum did not affect the reduction in resistance caused by <b>pimaricin.</b> Varying the composition of the recovery medium similarly affected the resistance to freezing the thawing of pimaricin-exposed and unexposed cells. Sensitivity to ultraviolet light was apparently not affected by <b>pimaricin</b> either by preliminary exposure or when irradiated in the presence of <b>pimaricin.</b> It is suggested that <b>pimaricin</b> lowers the heat resistance of S. cerevisiae by depleting essential nutrients of the cells through a disruption of permeability, and that heat-damaged cells cannot resynthesize these nutrients.

40|$|Streptomyces {{secondary}} metabolism is strongly affected by oxygen availability. The increased culture aeration enhances <b>pimaricin</b> production in S. natalensis, however the excess of O 2 consumption {{can lead to}} an intracellular ROS imbalance that is harmful to the cell. The adaptive physiological response of S. natalensis upon the addition of exogenous H 2 O 2 suggested that the modulation of the intracellular ROS levels, through the activation of the H 2 O 2 inducible catalase during the late exponential growth phase, can alter the production of <b>pimaricin.</b> With the construction of defective mutants on the H 2 O 2 related enzymes SodF, AhpCD and KatA 1, an effective and enduring modulation of intracellular ROS was achieved. Characterization of the knock-out strains revealed different behaviours regarding <b>pimaricin</b> production: whilst the superoxide dismutase defective mutant presented low levels of <b>pimaricin</b> production compared to the wild-type, the mutants defective on the H 2 O 2 -detoxifying enzymes displayed a <b>pimaricin</b> overproducer phenotype.

40|$|In {{most active}} {{packaging}} systems for food applications, the preservative release is uncontrolled and frequently ineffective due to excessive or insufficient preservative {{concentration in the}} food matrix at a particular time. This work was aimed to evaluate the usefulness of pH- and temperature-sensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) nanohydrogels for developing smart delivery systems to release preservatives {{as a response to}} environmental triggers. <b>Pimaricin</b> was used as a model preservative. Loading and release efficiencies were studied as a function of incorporation time and nanohydrogels composition, that differed in the cross-linker and acrylic acid content. <b>Pimaricin</b> loading efficiency was not affected by the acrylic acid. However, the cross-linking degree and incorporation time had a great influence. The lower the cross-linker content, the higher the loading efficiency, which in all cases exceeded 70 % at 12 h, approaching 100 % after 60 h of incorporation. No significant differences were observed between loading efficiencies obtained using water or methanol for <b>pimaricin</b> solubilisation. On the other hand, <b>pimaricin</b> release was dependent on the gel collapse, determined by the gel composition. Increasing the cross-linker content enhanced the nanoparticles' rigidity, and inclusion of acrylic acid as comonomer promoted strong electrostatic repulsions among the polymer chains. In both cases, the collapse was hampered, leading to a more hydrated collapsed state that favoured a sustained release of <b>pimaricin.</b> A mathematical model was also developed to predict the <b>pimaricin</b> release as a function of pH, temperature and storage time, allowing to select the most suitable nanohydrogel for a specific food application.

40|$|Control of polyene {{macrolide}} production in Streptomyces natalensis is {{mediated by the}} transcriptional activator PimR. This regulator combines an N-terminal domain corresponding to the Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein (SARP) family of transcriptional activators with a C-terminal half homologous to guanylate cyclases and large ATP-binding regulators of the LuxR family. The PimR SARP domain (PimR(SARP)) was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) -fused protein. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that GST-PimR(SARP) binds a single target, the intergenic region between the regulatory genes pimR and pimMs in the <b>pimaricin</b> cluster. The PimR(SARP) -binding site was investigated by DNaseI protection studies, revealing that it contains three heptameric direct repeats adjusting to the consensus 5 '-CGGCAAG- 3 '. Transcription start points of pimM and pimR promoters were identified by 5 '-RACE, revealing that unlike other SARPs, PimR(SARP) does not interact with the - 35 region of its target promoter. Quantitative transcriptional analysis of these regulatory genes on mutants on each of them has allowed {{the identification of the}} pimM promoter as the transcriptional target for PimR. Furthermore, the constitutive expression of pimM restored <b>pimaricin</b> production in a pimaricin-deficient strain carrying a deletion mutant of pimR. These results reveal that PimR exerts its positive effect on <b>pimaricin</b> production by controlling pimM expression level, a regulator whose gene product activates transcription from eight different promoters of <b>pimaricin</b> structural genes directly...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Polyenes {{represent}} a major class of antifungal agents characterised {{by the presence}} of a series of conjugated double bonds in their planar hydroxylated macrolide ring structure. Despite their general interest, very {{little is known about the}} factors that modulate their biosynthesis. Among these factors, we have recently discovered a new inducing compound (PI-factor) in the <b>pimaricin</b> producer Streptomyces natalensis, which elicits polyene production in a manner characteristic of quorum sensing. Here, we describe the involvement of an amino-acid exporter from S. natalensis in modulating the expression of <b>pimaricin</b> biosynthetic genes via secretion of the quorum-sensing pimaricin-inducer PI-factor. Results Adjacent to the <b>pimaricin</b> gene cluster lies a member of the RhtB family of amino-acid exporters. Gene deletion and complementation experiments provided evidence for a role for PimT in the export of L-homoserine, L-serine, and L-homoserine lactone. Expression of the gene was shown to be induced by homoserine and by the quorum-sensing pimaricin-inducer PI-factor. Interestingly, the mutant displayed 65 % loss of <b>pimaricin</b> production, and also 50 % decrease in the production of PI, indicating that PimT is used as PI-factor exporter, and suggesting that the effect in antifungal production might be due to limited secretion of the inducer. Conclusion This report describes the involvement of an amino acid exporter (encoded by pimT in the vicinity of the <b>pimaricin</b> cluster) in modulating the expression of antibiotic biosynthetic genes via secretion of the quorum-sensing pimaricin-inducer PI-factor. The discovery of the participation of amino acid exporters in a signal transduction cascade for the production of polyene macrolides is unexpected, and represents an important step forward towards understanding the regulatory network for polyene regulation. Additionally, this finding constitutes the first detailed characterization of an amino-acid exporter in an Actinomycete, and to our knowledge, the first evidence for the implication of this type of exporters in quorum sensing. </p...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: The post-polyketide synthase biosynthetic {{tailoring}} of polyene macrolides {{usually involves}} oxidations catalysed by cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases (P 450 s). Although members from {{this class of}} enzymes are common in macrolide biosynthetic gene clusters, their specificities vary considerably toward the substrates utilised and {{the positions of the}} hydroxyl functions introduced. In addition, some of them may yield epoxide groups. Therefore, the identification of novel macrolide monooxygenases with activities toward alternative substrates, particularly epoxidases, is a fundamental aspect of the growing field of combinatorial biosynthesis. The specific alteration of these activities should constitute a further source of novel analogues. We investigated this possibility by directed inactivation of one of the P 450 s belonging to the biosynthetic gene cluster of an archetype polyene, <b>pimaricin.</b> Results: A recombinant mutant of the pimaricin-producing actinomycete Streptomyces natalensis produced a novel <b>pimaricin</b> derivative, 4, 5 -deepoxypimaricin, as a major product. This biologically active product resulted from the phage-mediated targeted disruption of the gene pimD, which encodes the cytochrome P 450 epoxidase that converts deepoxypimaricin into <b>pimaricin.</b> The 4, 5 -deepoxypimaricin has been identified by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance following high-performance liquid chromatography purification. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that PimD is the epoxidase responsible for the conversion of 4, 5 -deepoxypimaricin to <b>pimaricin</b> in S. natalensis. The metabolite accumulated by the recombinant mutant, in which the epoxidase has been knocked out, constitutes the first designer polyene obtained by targeted manipulation of a polyene biosynthetic gene cluster. This novel epoxidase could prove to be valuable for the introduction of epoxy substituents into designer macrolides...|$|E

Salami were dipped or sprayed with natamycin (<b>pimaricin)</b> or were given a combined organic acid-plus-potassium sorbate treatment. Acetic and citric acids potentiated the inhibitory effects of potassium sorbate significantly, but lactic and succinic acids showed little or no effect. Treatment of salami by dipping in 2. 5 % (wt/vol) potassium sorbate or 2, 000 ppm (mg/liter) of <b>pimaricin</b> did not successfully prevent the growth of surface molds. At 10 % potassium sorbate on all types of salami and at 2. 5 % sorbate on Casalingo salami, visual inhibition of mold growth was observed, but numbers of viable fungi on all salami types treated with 2. 5 % sorbate were not significantly (95 % confidence) different from numbers found in the untreated controls. <b>Pimaricin</b> spray (2 X 1, 000 ppm) {{was as good as}} or slightly better than 2. 5 % potassium sorbate, but greater concentrations of each were required to satisfactorily inhibit surface mold growth during the 25 - to 50 -day ripening period...|$|E
40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of the {{antifungal agent}} <b>pimaricin</b> by Streptomyces natalensis {{has been proposed}} to involve a cytochrome P 450 encoded by the gene pimD. <b>Pimaricin</b> is derived from its immediate precursor de-epoxypimaricin by epoxidation of the C- 4 –C- 5 double bond on the macrolactone ring. We have overproduced PimD with a N-terminal His 6 affinity tag in Escherichia coli and purified the enzyme for kinetic analysis. The protein showed a reduced CO-difference spectrum with a Soret maximum at 450  nm, indicating {{that it is a}} cytochrome P 450. Purified PimD was shown to catalyse the in vitro C- 4 –C- 5 epoxidation of 4, 5 -de-epoxypimaricin to <b>pimaricin.</b> The enzyme was dependent on NADPH for activity with optimal pH at 7. 5, and the temperature optimum was 30  °C. The kcat value for the epoxidation of de-epoxypimaricin was similar to the values reported for other macrolide oxidases. Enzyme activity was inhibited at high substrate concentration.

A 10 to 40 times higher concentration of amphotericin B (heptaene) or nystatin (degenerated heptaene) was necessary to inhibit colony formation of hamster cells than that needed to inhibit colony formation of yeast cells. In contrast, colony formation of both hamster and yeast cells was inhibited {{to the same extent}} by similar concentrations of filipin (pentaene), pentamycin (pentaene), or <b>pimaricin</b> (tetraene).

40|$|AbstractBackground: Polyene {{macrolides}} are a {{class of}} large macrocyclic polyketides that interact with membrane sterols, having antibiotic activity against fungi but not bacteria. Their rings include a chromophore of 3 – 7 conjugated double bonds which constitute the distinct polyene structure. <b>Pimaricin</b> is an archetype polyene, important in the food industry as a preservative to prevent mould contamination of foods, produced by Streptomyces natalensis. We set out to clone, sequence and analyse the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of this tetraene. Results: A large cluster of 16 open reading frames spanning 84   985 bp of the S. natalensis genome has been sequenced and found to encode 13 homologous sets of enzyme activities (modules) of a polyketide synthase (PKS) distributed within five giant multienzyme proteins (PIMS 0 –PIMS 4). The total of 60 constituent active sites, 25 of them on a single enzyme (PIMS 2), make this an exceptional multienzyme system. Eleven additional genes appear to govern modification of the polyketide-derived framework and export. Disruption of the genes encoding the PKS abolished <b>pimaricin</b> production. Conclusions: The overall architecture of the PKS gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of the 26 -membered polyene macrolide <b>pimaricin</b> has been determined.

Fecha de lectura: 24 - 05 - 2010 The infection {{caused by}} opportunistic fungi {{is a growing}} threats for human health, because the increase of immunocompromised population. Unlike the antibacterials, the number of antifungal drugs is very limited. Only three out of seven classes of currently available antifungal agents are suitable for treatment of systemic infections: polyenes, azoles and echinocandins; these seemed to be insufficient for flight the widespread of opportunistic pathogens. In the last decades, several semi synthetics polyene macrolide derivatives were developed in attempts to improve their excellent pharmacological properties. The data concerned with the structure/activity relationships, currently available on the literature, clearly demonstrated that changing the charge of exocyclic carboxylic group (present {{in most of the}} polyene macrolides) into a positive group increases the specificity of the drugs towards their targets microorganisms. Thus, modification of the well conserved carboxyl group into their carboxamide derivatives, can be an interesting tool for generating new and more specific antimycotic agents. Recently, new natural carboxamide tetraenes were reported. The polyene-amide derivatives were “in vivo” generated by tailoring the parental polyene rimocidin, <b>pimaricin</b> and CE- 108. The activity was shown to be ATP and glutamine dependent and can be a tool for biotechnological challenge to develop new antifungal drugs. In this work the pcsB gene from Streptomyces sp. RGU 5. 3, responsible for the conversion of <b>pimaricin</b> into its amide derivative AB- 400, was isolated and characterized its gene product. The pcsB gene codes for an asparagine synthase of 615 amino acid residues. The gene is located outside the <b>pimaricin</b> biosynthetic cluster and in a very well conserved chromosomal region next to the pho operon. The genetic architecture {{is similar to that of}} pcsA from Streptomyces diastaticus var. 108, which also tailors rimocidin, CE- 108 and <b>pimaricin.</b> PcsB seemed to be more restricted for their substrate recognition that PcsA.

The protein PcsB was purified using a histidine tag and some enzymatic parameters was determined for the three substrates: <b>pimaricin,</b> ATP and glutamine. Interestingly, PcsB can partially recognize CE- 108 D (a polyene macrolide of the rimocidin family), but neither Rimocidin nor CE- 108.

Our findings suggest the existence of binding sites (sterols?) on the chitosome that are selective for certain polyenes and that play a role in the operation of chitin synthase.

All six mutants resistant to nystatin and <b>pimaricin</b> showed either loss of ergosterol and concurrent production of Δ 7, 22 -ergostadien- 3 β-ol and Δ 7 -ergosten- 3 β-ol, {{or loss of}} both the wild-type sterols, with production of Δ 8 (9) -ergosten- 3 β-ol and Δ 5, 8 (9), 22 -ergostatrien- 3 β-ol. The mutants producing Δ 7, 22 -ergostadien- 3 β-ol and Δ 7 -ergosten- 3 β-ol showed relatively low levels of resistance to nystatin and <b>pimaricin,</b> whereas the mutants producing Δ 8 (9) -ergosten- 3 β-ol and Δ 5, 8 (0), 22 -ergostatrien- 3 β-ol showed {{a high level of}} resistance to either drug. Although highly resistant to amphotericin B, however, the three mutants produced sterol compositions identical to those of the wild types, indicating that the strains acquired resistance other than by alteration of the membrane sterols. The mutants producing Δ 8 (9) and Δ 5, 8 (9), 22 sterols were not virulent for mice, showed reduced growth rates at 25 C, and failed to grow at 37 C. The other mutants showed a slightly reduced rate of growth both at 25 and 37 C, and the virulence in mice was slightly reduced in comparison with that of the wild types. These comparisons were on gross observations and were not statistically analyzed...|$|E

40|$|Medical {{treatment}} failure necessitated surgery in nine cases of fungal keratitis. Therapeutic surgery eliminated fungal infection in seven cases, and useful vision was retained in {{five out of}} six penetrating keratoplasties. In three cases Natamycin (<b>Pimaricin)</b> therapy rendered fungi non-viable, but two were demonstrable by histopathology. These results suggest that antifungal treatment should be applied {{for as long as}} possible before therapeutic surgery in order to improve the final visual outcome...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} how <b>pimaricin</b> and mycostatin improved the keeping quality of cottage cheese. The specific objectives were as follows: (1) to develop a method for the determination of <b>pimaricin</b> and mycostatin in cottage cheese, (2) to determine the stability of the antibiotics in the cheese, (3) to determine the effect of the antibiotics upon the sugar utilization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and (4) to determine the effect of these antibiotics upon lipolytic microorganisms. Warburg technique trials were made to determine the residual concentrations of the antibiotics in cheese, washed with antibiotic solution, and to determine the stability of the antibiotics during storage at 40 °, 50 °, or 60 °F. In general, the cheeses with the higher concentration of antibiotics and held at the lower storage temperature had the maximum stability. It was observed that mycostatin was less stable and lost its potency more rapidly at the higher storage temperature than <b>pimaricin.</b> The antibiotics retarded the fungal growth and spoilage of cottage cheese. The cheese stored at lower temperature and containing higher concentration of antibiotics had the best keeping quality. A comparison of endogenous oxygen consumption, and the aerobic utilization of lactose, glucose, and galactose by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in the presence and absence of the antibiotics showed that both of these processes are inhibited by the antibiotics. The results showed that the antibiotics blocked the metabolism of the three sugars approximately at the same extent indicating that the three sugars are metabolized by somewhat similar processes by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Also, it appears that the inhibition of the growth Saccharomyces cerevisiae, by the antibiotics, may be directly related to the inhibition of the sugar utilization. The antibiotics exhibited extremely mild inhibitory effects upon the cell production of the culture. The microbial lipase was shown to be inhibited by the antibiotics. In general, it was found that <b>pimaricin</b> and mycostatin increased the shelf-life of cottage cheese. The antibiotics seem to be more effective in retarding the spoilage of cheese when added through cream dressing than when added through wash water. In the latter case, the antibiotics are probably retained in cheese by their being adsorbed upon the cheese proteins. The keeping quality of the cheese was maximum at lower temperatures (40 °F.) presumably because the antibiotics were more stable at that temperature. Advisor: Khem M. Shahan...|$|E
40|$|Fungal {{inhibition}} in four {{commonly used}} agar media was improved by substituting natamycin (<b>pimaricin)</b> for cycloheximide. The recovery of bacteria was {{not affected by}} natamycin, whereas fungal contamination {{from a variety of}} samples was significantly suppressed. Furthermore, natamycin lacks the occupational health hazards of cycloheximide. Medium-dependent natamycin degradation occurred during the preparation and refrigerated storage of agar plates, but the addition of natamycin at 21. 6 μg/ml resulted in effective residual activity...|$|E
40|$|Supplementary data {{related to}} this article {{can be found at}} [URL] is a {{fungicide}} commonly used on the cheese surface. In this work poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) nanohydrogels copolymerized with acrylic acid (PNIPA- 20 AA(5)) were proposed to encapsulate <b>pimaricin</b> and release it in a controlled manner to prevent a real food product, Arzúa-Ulloa DOP cheese, from food spoilage. The results reflect that the nanohydrogel coating neither impart any adverse effects (compared to the control) nor influence the natural ripening process of Arzúa-Ulloa DOP cheese. In the bioassay with artificial contamination, the total fungal counts in cheeses with the pimaricin-loaded nanohydrogel coating (NP) were lower than those of all the other treatments, during all the assay (30 days). Despite significant (p <  0. 05) differences were not maintained for a long time, probably due to the very high initial microbial load, the antimicrobial effect of the NP-coating evidenced its protective effect in cheeses. A new qPCR method that allows the total fungal counts to be quantified directly from the cheese samples was also developed to avoid the inconveniences associated with the traditional methods based on Standard Plate Count (SPC). The efficiency of the reaction in the cheese matrix was good, and the qPCR assay was highly linear. A good correlation between both analysis (SPC and qPCR) was observed (around 100 % of accuracy). The results obtained in this work reveal the usefulness of thermosensitive nanohydrogels for encapsulating and releasing <b>pimaricin</b> {{to reduce the amount of}} free <b>pimaricin</b> in the foods bulk but getting sufficient inhibition of fungal growth.

Eosinophilic plasmacytic conjunctivitis was detected histopathologically in a biopsy specimen. Both a second surgical specimen and drainage fluid from a gingival mass and fistula contained fungal hyphae in giant cells with granulomatous inflammation. Allergic S. commune mycosis was suspected at this point. A monokaryotic isolate was characterized morphologically, and then identified genetically.

40|$|Clinical {{findings}} {{and treatment of}} keratomycosis caused by Beauveria bassiana, an entomopathogenic filamentous fungus, are described for an 80 -year-old woman, who was referred {{to the hospital for}} ocular pain and redness on the 9 th day after an ocular injury caused by the frame of her glasses. She had a long history of recurrent diabetic iritis and continuously used topical antibiotics and corticosteroids. At her first visit, a slit-lamp examination indicated a corneal ulcer confined within the superficial stromal layer, along with a slight infiltration and edema. Only a very few inflammatory cells were seen in the anterior chamber. Direct microscopic examination of corneal scrapings revealed septate fungal hyphae with zig-zag rachis and budding that was subsequently identified as B. bassiana by slide culture. Topical voriconazole with miconazole, <b>pimaricin</b> and oral itraconazole were effective and the lesion disappeared leaving only a mild scar at 2 months. The sensitivity of B. bassiana to various antimycotic agents was confirmed by broth microdilution, agar dilution with the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute standard, and a disk method using topically applied concentrations. B. bassiana, which exhibits a characteristic appearance in smears and causes superficial keratomycosis, is sensitive to voriconazole with miconazole, <b>pimaricin,</b> and itraconazole...|$|E
40|$|In this project, the {{production}} of the antifungal antibiotic, <b>Pimaricin,</b> by Streptomyces natalensis was investigated with a view to developing an Industrial fermentation process. A suitable medium was developed to produce dispersed growth in submerged culture, which was desirable for optimum antibiotic production. A spectrophotometric assay was successfully developed to rapidly determine the concentration of the antibiotic in culture supernates. Results from this assay were shown to be in agreement with the traditional microbiological assay. Factors affecting <b>pimaricin</b> production were investigated in shake flasks. Dosing the fermentation with sodium citrate was shown to {{have a significant effect on}} production. A rapid method for screening large numbers of survivors from a mutagenesis programme was developed. EMS and UV mutagenesis provided a number of isolates with increased productivity. Scale-up of the process in a 16 litre stirred fermenter proved difficult with the culture showing a strong requirement for oxygen. However, yields were equivalent to, and in some cases higher than those obtained in shake flasks. Although, improvements were made to the overall process, yields that would make the process economically viable were not obtained. This project was funded by Biocon Biochemicals Ltd., Cork, Ireland.
