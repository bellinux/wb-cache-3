40|$|Black Bovan Nera pullets {{at point}} of lay (19 weeks old) that were fed pigeon Pea Seed Meal (PSM) diets during the <b>pullet</b> <b>chick</b> and grower {{stages of life}} were used to {{determine}} the effect of higher inclusion level and prolonged feeding of raw or processed PSM diets from the <b>pullet</b> <b>chick</b> stage on the laying performance of pullets. Brown colored pigeon pea seeds were used as raw, boiled for 30 min, toasted for 30 min, or soaked in water for 24 h, all of which were milled to pass through a 2 mm sieve. Each diet had three replications; each replicate had eight birds in a Completely Randomized Design (CRD). Parameters measured were feed intake, live weight, hen-day production, age at 1 st, 25 and 50 % egg production, external and internal egg quality characteristics. Results showed that layers fed boiled PSM diet had significantly (P< 0. 05) higher hen-day production (67. 04 %), egg weight (57. 63 g), shell weight (6. 50 g) while those fed raw PSM diet had the lowest (55. 07 %) hen-day production. It was concluded that raw or processed pigeon Pea Seed Meal (PSM) could be included as 30 % of the whole diet of layers that had received 10 and 20 % PSM based diets during their <b>pullet</b> <b>chick</b> and grower stages of life, respectively. Boiled PSM diet would improve hen-day egg production, toasted PSM diet would increase feed intake of layers while PSM diets will have no regular effects on external and internal egg quality characteristics of eggs laid by layers fed PSM diets...|$|E

The study investigated the addition of mixtures of garlic and ginger to diets of <b>pullet</b> <b>chicks,</b> growers and laying hens to evaluate beneficial effects on growth and egg production as well as their possible effects on lipid content of serum and yolk. Five diets were used for the study. Control diet was not supplemented with any of the mixtures. Four increasing levels of garlic (0. 5 %, 1. 0 %, 1. 5 % and 2. 0 %) were incorporated into diets for <b>pullet</b> <b>chicks,</b> growers and laying hens. Ginger supplements were also added to the diets at 0. 5 % and 0. 75 %. The results showed that the mixtures of garlic and ginger were beneficial by promoting final live weight of pullet growers, laying hens and also by lowering total cholesterol, triacylglycerol concentration in serum and yolk. Furthermore, the mixtures of garlic and ginger significantly (p< 0. 001) improved hen day production, egg weight and feed conversion. However, dietary inclusion of the mixtures significantly reduced shell weight and thickness. Significant (p< 0. 001) negative linear relationships were observed between dietary mixtures of garlic and ginger with parameters of serum and yolk lipids.

The chicks received ad libitum feed and water {{from the first day}} of age to week 22. Birds were individually penned from week 18 to determine time of oviposition and egg weight and quantity. The mean Body Weight (BW) and Feed Intake (FI) were recorded and calculated every 3 weeks. One pullet from each replicate on week 8 and day of oviposition was sacrified. Then, the weight of internal organs as percentage including: femur, FeW; breast, BrW; heart, HW; spleen, SW; liver, LW; gut, GW; fat cavity, FW; oviduct, ovary and Large Yellow Follicles (LYF) and number of LYF were measured. Our results indicated that as the level of FS increases from 5 - 7. 5 % and 10 %, the BW and FI reduce, thus FCR increases in pullets. The evaluation of internal organs at 8 th week and 1 th oviposition, revealed no significant differences between treatments and control group. Although, in the 1 st time, FS treatments increased HW and LW, but decreased FW; whereas in the 2 nd time, FeW, BrW and GW induced and SW and LW reduced.

40|$|Three {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of dietary ratio of linoleic to linolenic acid on egg production and immune response in Leghorn chickens. Corn oil rich in linoleic acid and flaxseed rich in linolenic acid were used to adjust levels of dietary linoleic and linolenic acids. The first {{study was conducted to}} investigate the effects of four dietary ratios of linoleic to linolenic acid [17 : 1 (control), 8 : 1, 4 : 1, or 2 : 1] in <b>pullet</b> <b>chicks</b> on immune response to standard vaccinations. Dietary ratio of linoleic to linolenic acid did not influence feed consumption and body weight. Decreasing dietary ratios enhanced (P 3 ̆c 0. 004) antibody production against Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine at 12 to 16 weeks of age. The dietary ratio of 4 : 1 or 2 : 1 enhanced antibody production against infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) vaccine at 16 weeks of age. The second study was conducted to investigate whether dietary ratio of linoleic to linolenic acid affected egg production parameters and immune response of mature laying hens. Dietary ratio of linoleic to linolenic acid did not affect egg production and quality. Decreasing dietary ratio from 17 : 1 to 8 : 1 or 4 : 1 improved antibody production against NDV vaccine (P 3 ̆c 0. 0004) and in vitro lymphocyte proliferation in response to Con A (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) or LPS (P 3 ̆c 0. 02). The relationship between dietary ratio of linoleic to linolenic acid on subpopulations of blood T lymphocytes was evaluated in a third study. Decreasing dietary ratio of linoleic to linolenic acid from 17 : 1 to 8 : 1, 4 : 1, or 2 : 1 significantly increased proportion of CD 4 +CD 8 − T lymphocytes, but decreased proportion of CD 4 −CD 8 + T lymphocytes. These observations indicate that supplementing flaxseed as a source of linolenic acid (18 : 3 n- 3) to lower dietary ratio of linoleic to linolenic acid improved the immune response of Leghorn chickens without showing negative effects on body weight gain and egg production. The linolenic acid-induced change in blood T-lymphocyte subpopulations may be attributed to the enhancement of immune response. ...|$|R

The chicks were placed in the at 3 cage densities (211. 8, 274. 5 and 370. 6 cm 2 per bird) and on 3 positions (as top, middle and bottom tiers). All birds were kept under standard management policy and a commercial vaccination program was practiced. Total specific antibody titres to Infectious Brochitis Virus (IBV), Infectious Bursal Desease Virus (IBDV), Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) and Egg Drop Syndrome Virus (EDSV) vaccines at the ages of 5, 10 and 20 weeks were serologically determined by ELISA. Cellmediated immune response was also evaluated. In commercial white egg laying strains specific antibody titres to IBV, IBDV, NDV and EDSV vaccines were greater than in Brown egg layer strains. Keeping in cage created more stress in Brown egg laying chicks than those in white egg laying chicks.

Results showed that prolonged feeding of raw or processed PSM diets to pullets did not significantly affect live weight at POL, daily weight gain, FCR and average mortality while pullets fed raw PSM diet had significantly (P< 0. 05) lower feed and protein intake than others. Raw PSM diet also significantly reduced daily feed cost and consequently feed cost to POL more than others did. It was concluded that PSM could be a good protein source for <b>pullets</b> from the <b>chick</b> stage to point of lay. PSM could be included as 20 % of the grower pullet diet without any adverse effect on performance.

40|$|Brazil is the world's largest broiler meat exporter. Health control, {{knowledge}} and technology, {{as well as}} the natural aspects of the country are pointed out as the keys for the success of that product in the market. Brazilian broiler production grew significantly in the last decade; it creates jobs and has a significant social role in Brazilian economy. This study aimed at evaluating the Brazilian broiler meat supply chain from 2000 to 2010 using the social network analysis (SNA). Data from governmental and private sources were organized and analyzed. The focus of this study was the broiler production supply chain segment involving the hatchery, the broiler farm, the feed mill, the processing plant, and the government. The inputs considered were one-day-old <b>chicks,</b> <b>pullet,</b> feedstuff, and the infrastructure; and the outputs were broiler meat and taxes paid. The software UCINET was applied for calculating the structural attributes and indicators of the network. Results showed a relatively disorganized network in 2000 with the strongest tie between the farmer and the processing plant. The structural organization of the network improved until 2010. The density of the ties in the broiler meat production network increased steadily from 2000 to 2010 within a vertical cohesive supply chain structure. The success of Brazilian broiler meat production is attributed to the abundance of land, fertile soil, favorable climate, and the effort and investments in research and development by innovative companies in the last few years. The {{results of the present study}} showed that Brazilian broiler production evolved positively in the last ten years, and it was weakly influenced by international challenges. 2015 Brazilian Journal of Poultry Science...|$|R
40|$|Three {{experiments}} utilizing pullets from hatcheries {{using different}} beak trimming techniques {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of degree of beak trimming on the performance and welfare of White Leghorns. The methods used to modify beak length were: Exp. 1 - infrared (IF) varying guide-plate hole sizes (H, Strain 1); Exp. 2 – IF varying IF intensity (I, Strain 2); and Exp. 3 – hot-blade (HB) varying guide-plate hole sizes (H, Strain 3). Beak treatments included control (C), and an attempt to remove 20, 40 and 60 % of the beak of day-old <b>chicks.</b> <b>Pullets</b> were housed on litter floor pens for the brooding and rearing period (0 - 17 wks) and commercial cages for the laying period (17 - 59 wks). Performance records were initiated at 19 wks and continued until 59 wks of age. Altering beak length was successful for Exp. 3 only, achieving 14, 31 and 39 % reduction in length for the respective treatments. IF methods achieved 30 to 36 % reduction regardless of the severity goal. A reduction in growth during part of the brooding and rearing period which continued throughout the duration of the trial for the 60 % severity of Exp. 3. Feed intake was reduced in treated birds of Exp. 1 and 3, but not Exp. 2. Hen- day egg production, egg weight and specific gravity were unaffected. However, hen- housed egg production was reduced for the controls of all experiments due to an increase in mortalities. Behaviour observations via scan sampling indicated pain 1 -d post- treatment in Exp. 3 by a decrease in running and litter pecking and a non-significant increase in resting. Minor effects of IF treatment were seen 1 -d post-treatment, suggesting reduced or a lack of pain. An apparent but inconsistent effect of both HB and IF treatment was showed increase in object pecking throughout the trial. A general decrease in aggressive behaviour in treated birds of all experiments was noted. Feather condition improved for all treated birds. In conclusion, beak trimming regardless of technique or severity caused minor effects on hen performance while improving welfare conditions relating to decreased aggression and mortalities and an improvement in feather condition...|$|R
40|$|Two entirely {{separate}} research issues {{form the}} two parts of this thesis. A survey of small-scale poultry production systems in Botswana is presented in Part A and an evaluation of a natural zeolite in broiler diets in Part B. Part A examined the aspects of management, productivity parameters, farm inputs, housing, feeding, diseases and marketing in small-scale poultry farms in Botswana. In both small-scale layer and broiler farms, {{only a small percentage}} of producers were below the age of 30 years, probably reflecting the high costs associated with these systems. Clearly young people would not have the necessary capital to start the projects and the finding emphasises lack of credit being a major constraint to the growth of poultry industry in Botswana. In the two production systems, female producers showed a higher percentage of ownership of poultry projects showing that the government policies have achieved the objective of encouraging involvement of women in business. The average hen day production in small-scale layer farms was 71. 7 % and the average feed intake was 108. lg per hen per day. Correlation analysis showed that the feed intake was positively related (P = 0. 03; R 2 = 0. 92) to egg production. It was observed that hen day egg production was low in farms where feed intake was low, highlighting the importance of providing sufficient amounts of feed. An average of 1 740 g of feed was required to produce one dozen of eggs. This feed efficiency level was better than those recorded in some countries, but poorer than the breeder's recommendation (1 580 g feed/dozen eggs). Hens were culled after 52 weeks in production (around 78 weeks of age). During this period, a hen produced an average of 245 eggs; this was lower than 300 or more eggs for modern layers under optimum conditions. Factors responsible for the poor layer performance under small farm conditions in Botswana are clearly complex, but poor managerial skills and, poor quality of feed and pullets are major contributing reasons. The lower production levels, however, show that there is room for improvements and also highlight the need for better record keeping. The average mortality from 18 weeks of age to culling was 8. 46 %. Diseases or conditions reportedly associated with these deaths included Newcastle Disease, prolapse of the uterus and diarrhoea, but none of the producers vaccinated their flocks. The small-scale broiler farms in Botswana grow an average of 4 - 5 batches per year. The number of production cycles is determined by the number of sheds in a farm, the interval between broiler batches and the availability of the market in a given location. Most broiler farms adhered to the extension advice of two weeks interval to prevent any disease transmission between batches. The average slaughter age was 48. 3 days at an average carcass weight of 1. 46 kg. The average amount of feed required to produce a broiler bird was 4. 6 kg. The feed conversion ratio for small-scale broiler birds in Botswana was 2. 72 kg feed/kg gain, considerably higher when compared to Cobb standards (1. 60 kg feed/kg gain). The high feed conversion ratio values in small-scale farms are due probably reflective of, among others, the poor quality feeds, management conditions, length of the production cycle and feed wastage. Correlation analysis showed that when the age at slaughter increases, the average feed conversion ratio is increased (P = 0. 0001). This finding is of economic relevance in Botswana, because small-scale producers keep the broilers longer to satisfy consumer preferences. But the cost of keeping these birds would be higher than the returns from sales because of decreasing feed efficiency. The average mortality was 9. 15 %. Diseases or conditions reportedly associated with these deaths included Newcastle disease, infectious bursal disease, diarrhoea, chronic respiratory disease, paralysis of the limbs and coccidiosis. In most cases, productivity parameters recorded in the current study are higher than those used by the Ministry of Agriculture for budgeting purposes. In the present survey, baseline data have been generated on the performance levels in small poultry farms and the production systems have been characterised. In addition to establishing the production standards, it has raised several issues needing attention. The results showed that the future growth of poultry industry in Botswana is constrained by a number of factors including lack of proper knowledge in poultry husbandry and nutrition, irregular supply and poor quality of feeds and breeding stock, inadequate support services and access to credit, as well as a poor marketing infrastructure. It is also clear that intensive systems of raising poultry may not be financially viable long-term in Botswana, because of the strong dependence on external sources for all major inputs (<b>chicks,</b> <b>pullets,</b> feed etc). The Government, in association with organisations such as Botswana Poultry Association, should formulate policies to address these issues. The results from a 35 -day feeding experiment, conducted to evaluate the influence of a natural zeolite (Mordenite) on the performance of broiler chickens fed maize-soyabean meal diets, are presented in Part B of the thesis. Four levels of Mordenite (0, 2. 5, 5. 0 and 7. 5 %) were incorporated in diets formulated to provide similar levels of apparent metabolisable energy, lysine and methionine plus cysteine. Each dietary treatment was fed to ten replicate pens (4 birds/pen). Inclusion of 2. 5 % Mordenite improved weight gains of broilers by 4. 1 % over that from control diet with no Mordenite, but the difference were not statistically significant (P > 0. 05). Weight gains of birds fed diets containing 5. 0 % Mordenite were similar (P > 0. 05) to those fed the control diet. There was. however, a significant (P 0. 05) on feed intake compared to controls. Inclusion of Mordenite to levels up to 5 % had no effect (P > 0. 05) on the feed efficiency of broilers. The inclusion of 2. 5 % Mordenite. however, caused a numerical improvement in feed utilisation (1. 47 versus 1. 5 lg feed/g gain). Feed efficiency was significantly (P < 0. 05) depressed when 7. 5 % Mordenite was included in the diets. Excreta nitrogen and phosphorus contents were affected linearly (P = 0. 001) by increasing levels of Mordenite. Excreta quality scores were not influenced by the inclusion of Mordenite. Overall, the findings are encouraging and showed that the addition of low levels of Mordenite (2. 5 %) is beneficial in improving broiler production and litter attributes...|$|R
