50|$|Electric trains that {{collect their}} current from {{overhead}} lines use a device {{such as a}} <b>pantograph,</b> <b>bow</b> collector or trolley pole. It presses against {{the underside of the}} lowest overhead wire, the contact wire. Current collectors are electrically conductive and allow current to flow through to the train or tram and back to the feeder station through the steel wheels on one or both running rails. Non-electric locomotives (such as diesels) may pass along these tracks without affecting the overhead line, although there may be difficulties with overhead clearance. Alternative electrical power transmission schemes for trains include third rail, ground-level power supply, batteries, and electromagnetic induction.|$|E
5000|$|A steeplecab {{design has}} a central (or nearly central) driving cab area which may include a full-height area in between for {{electrical}} equipment. On both ends, {{connected to the}} full-height cab areas, lower (usually sloping) [...] "noses" [...] contain other equipment, especially noisy equipment such as air compressors not desired within the cab area. When overhead lines are used for power transmission, the cab roof usually supports the equipment to collect the power (either by <b>pantograph(s)</b> <b>bow</b> collector(s) or trolley pole(s)), although on some early designs (such as the North Eastern Railways Electric number 1 -- later known as an [...] "ES1") a bow collector might be mounted {{on one of the}} bonnets (or [...] "nose hoods") instead.|$|R
50|$|Electric {{vehicles}} that collect their current from an {{overhead line system}} use different forms of one- or two-arm <b>pantograph</b> collectors, <b>bow</b> collectors or trolley poles. The current collection device presses against {{the underside of the}} lowest wire of an overhead line system, which is called a contact wire.|$|R
25|$|However, on most railway {{vehicles}} using overhead wire, {{the trolley}} pole {{has given way}} to the bow collector or, later, the pantograph, a folding metal device that presses a wide contact pan against the overhead wire. While more complex than the trolley pole, the pantograph has the advantage of being almost free from dewiring, being more stable at high speed, and being easier to raise and lower automatically. Also, on double-ended trams, they eliminate the need to manually turn the trolley pole when changing direction (although this disadvantage can be overcome to some extent through the use of trolley reversers). The use of <b>pantographs</b> (or <b>bow</b> collectors) exclusively also eliminates the need for wire frogs (switches in the overhead wiring) to make sure the pole goes in the correct direction at junctions.|$|R
50|$|Modern trams {{generally}} use overhead {{electric contact}} wires, {{from which they}} draw current through a <b>pantograph,</b> a <b>bow</b> collector (less commonly) or the now-rare trolley pole (the pantograph is most common and used on new tram designs). There are other methods of powering electric trams, sometimes preferred for aesthetic reasons since poles and overhead wires are not required. The old tram systems in London, Manhattan (New York City), and Washington, D.C., used live rails, like those on third-rail electrified railways, but in a conduit underneath the road, from which they drew power through a plough. It was called Conduit current collection. Washington's {{was the last of}} these to close, in 1962. Today, no commercial tramway uses this system. More recently, a modern equivalent to the old stud systems has been developed which allows for the safe installation of a third rail on city streets, which is known as surface current collection or ground-level power supply; the main example of this is the new tramway in Bordeaux.|$|R
50|$|From 1924, trams made up {{of three}} tramcars were {{operated}} during rush hours for reasons of cost. In subsequent years, the SSB continued to incur no significant outgoings. Apart from the two extensions to Br√ºckfeld and Wankdorf stadium, which operated only on special occasions, the main work the company performed on its tracks was maintenance work. As a search for cheap second hand tramcars in Germany, where the hyperinflation of 1923 had driven a number of tram operators into bankruptcy, did not produce the desired result, the company had to keep the 1901/02 vintage two axle motor tramcars in service by replacing the car bodies that had become rotten. Additionally, the Maximum motor tramcars were fitted with more powerful engines; the SSB thus hoped to extend their service life by 15 to 20 years. However, {{it was not possible}} to install track brakes in these cars, which is why they continued to operate mostly on line 3/4. From 1928, <b>pantographs</b> replaced the <b>bow</b> collectors with which the SSB tramcars had previously been fitted.|$|R
