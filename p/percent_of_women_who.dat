40|$|BACKGROUND.

METHODS. Utilization of mammography was assessed from a population <b>of</b> 59, 899 <b>women</b> <b>who</b> received 196, 891 mammograms at the Massachusetts General Hospi-tal Breast Imaging Division from January 1, 1990 to March 1, 1999, among which 604 invasive breast tumors were found.

40|$|Purpose This study aims {{to explore}} the reasons why women are leaving the workplace. Are they opting out of the {{workforce}} {{to stay at home}} with their children as current media reports suggest, or are the reasons more complex as the Kaleidoscope Career Model (KCM) suggests? A second objective is to examine whether or not women’s primary career motives change over time as predicted by the KCM. Lastly, the potential barriers or boundaries faced by women pursuing boundaryless careers will be identified. Design/methodology/approach A survey was sent to 2, 000 randomly selected <b>women</b> graduates <b>of</b> an international business school located in the USA. The response rate was 25 percent, or 497 women. Findings The results revealed that 47 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>women</b> surveyed had stopped working {{at some point in their}} career. Numerous reasons were cited for leaving. Only 35 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> stopped working cited rearing children as their sole reason for opting out. Sixty two <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>women</b> reported that their career focus had changed. In line with the KCM predictions, mid career women were most interested in finding balance in their lives and the desire for authenticity increased across the lifespan. Finally, 70 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> left eventually returned to work, debunking the myth that women opt out and do not return to the workforce. Our findings show that there are barriers that make it difficult to move across organizations, especially if time is taken off between jobs. Research limitations/implications All of the respondents in this study have a graduate degree in international business; thus, the results may have limited generalizability to other populations. Nonetheless, this study provides valuable data that helps us to better understand the complexities of women’s career paths. Originality/value This study makes contributions to two different areas of career theory. First, it provides one of the first empirical tests of the KCM. In addition to showing that women are leaving companies for more complex reasons than for family reasons alone, it also shows that women’s primary career motives shift over time in the manner predicted by the KCM. Second, the study contributes to the literature on boundaryless careers by showing that there are in fact barriers or boundaries faced by women attempting to pursue careers across organizationsPublicad...|$|R
