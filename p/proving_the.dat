5|$|Ian Garrad, {{impatient}} to establish whether the conversion was feasible, commissioned racing driver and fabricator Ken Miles to build another prototype {{as quickly as}} he could. Miles was provided with a budget of $800, a Series II Alpine, a Ford V8 engine and a 2-speed automatic transmission, and in about a week he had a running V8 conversion, thus <b>proving</b> <b>the</b> concept.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, the {{assumption}} of the subspecies' extinction was challenged when a hunter shot an adult female, <b>proving</b> <b>the</b> species had somehow survived the war. In 1989, scientists surveyed Vietnam's southern forests to search for evidence of other survivors. Fresh tracks belonging to up to 15 rhinos were found along the Dong Nai River.

5|$|The largest bomb used {{in combat}} during the war, Tarzon {{was used in}} strikes against North Korean bridges and other {{hardened}} targets, the Tarzon's improved accuracy over conventional 'dumb bombs' led to the confirmed destruction of at least six high-priority targets during approximately six months of combat use; these included a hydroelectric plant, <b>proving</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness of guided weapons against conventional targets as well as bridges.|$|E

5|$|After the riots, Bishop Kenrick {{ended his}} efforts to {{influence}} the public education system and began encouraging the creation of Catholic schools, with 17 being founded by 1860. The friars of the Church of St. Augustine sued the city of Philadelphia for not providing the church with adequate protection, claiming $80,000 in damages. The city argued that the friars could not claim their civil rights were violated, as the Order of St. Augustine was a foreign organization under the Pope. Furthermore, the city argued that the friars took a vow of poverty {{and could not be}} property owners. The Augustinians ended up <b>proving</b> <b>the</b> Order was incorporated in 1804 and was awarded $45,000. The church was rebuilt in 1848.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick dropped all {{his other}} {{responsibilities}} {{to concentrate on}} <b>proving</b> <b>the</b> existence of the neutron, assisted by Feather and frequently working late at night. He devised a simple apparatus that consisted of a cylinder containing a polonium source and beryllium target. The resulting radiation could then be directed at a material such as paraffin wax; the displaced particles, which were protons, would go into a small ionisation chamber {{where they could be}} detected with an oscilloscope.|$|E
5|$|Developing neurons travel {{toward the}} {{olfactory}} bulb along the RMS via glial tubes, which mark {{the division between}} the differentiated nervous tissue and the tissue with embryonic characteristics. Uniquely, the cells travel tangential to the brain surface, parallel to the pial surfaces rather than radially like most developing neurons. Neurons that migrate tangentially are typically believed to migrate independently of radial glia but in the RMS researchers believe {{this is not the}} case. Adult rat glial tubes have been observed via light and electron microscopy and described as a meshwork of astrocytic bodies and processes. They have been determined to be astrocytes based on the typical expression of GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and more specifically as protoplasmic astrocytes based on their morphology. Furthermore, these glial cells were found to be positive for vimentin expression, a protein commonly found in embryonic or immature glial cells. The developing neurons are identified by their expression of the cell surface molecule, a polysialylated (PSA) embryonic form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) called PSA-NCAM, as well as β-tubulin, a protein often found in postmitotic neuroblasts, <b>proving</b> <b>the</b> cells of RMS are committed to developing into neurons and will do so upon entry into the olfactory bulb. With the removal of NCAM, the neuroblasts scatter, <b>proving</b> <b>the</b> importance of NCAM in chain formation. The neurons form both clusters and chains along the lumen of these glial tubes.|$|E

After sabotaging Zoe's parachute, they are mixed up and a terrified Lydia began to worry that she might have got the sabotaged parachute. While doing the jump, Zoe's deploys, however Sarah's does not. As she hits the ground, Lydia screams in terror. She is completely destroyed by Sarah's death, but does not admit to being responsible when Zoe is arrested, and with that Lydia tries to commit suicide once again.|$|E
5|$|In 1933 and 1934, the Century of Progress International Exposition {{was held}} in Burnham Park. In the mid-1930s, the Chicago Park District used funds from the federal Works Progress Administration to {{complete}} landfill operations and install landscaping at Promontory Point by renowned designer Alfred Caldwell, {{a professor at the}} Illinois Institute of Technology. In 1935, Mayor Edward Joseph Kelly explored the idea of a permanent fair in the park. The state passed a bill creating the Metropolitan Fair and Exposition Authority and allowed construction of Meigs Field, after Northerly Island lost out as the site for the United Nations. In 1948, Burnham Park hosted the Chicago Railroad Fair, <b>proving</b> <b>the</b> location's viability for conventions, which eventually led to the construction of the first McCormick Place in 1960.|$|E

Lasker was also a research mathematician who was known for his {{contributions to}} commutative algebra, which included <b>proving</b> <b>the</b> primary decomposition of the ideals of polynomial rings.

The bodies were then left to burn as the Ustaše set the church on fire and waited outside to shoot any survivors attempting to escape the flames. On 13 May, a further 100 Serb males were executed by the Ustaše in the nearby village of Prekopi.|$|E

5|$|The {{operation}} did {{not give}} the Allies any tactical or strategic advantage; Howard notes that it provided experience for the planners in handling deception and for the Twenty Committee in <b>proving</b> <b>the</b> worth of double agents.

Dudley Clarke had already shown that the most effective method of deception involved the use of agents and faked wireless traffic, rather than major training and troop movements. Hardboiled was the first deception plan aimed at Norway. It led into several others, including Operation Tindall and Operation Solo, culminating in the 1944 Operation Fortitude North, one of the Allies' largest and most successful deceptions.|$|E
