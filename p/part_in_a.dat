40|$|Let A be any set of {{positive}} integers and n ∈ N. A composition of n with <b>parts</b> <b>in</b> <b>A</b> is an ordered collection {{of one or}} more elements <b>in</b> <b>A</b> whose sum is n. A palindromic composition of n with <b>parts</b> <b>in</b> <b>A</b> is a composition of n with <b>parts</b> <b>in</b> <b>A</b> <b>in</b> which the summands are the same in the given or <b>in</b> reverse order. <b>A</b> Carlitz (palindromic) composition of n with <b>parts</b> <b>in</b> <b>A</b> is a (palindromic) composition of n with <b>parts</b> <b>in</b> <b>A</b> <b>in</b> which no adjacent parts are the same. In this paper, we study the generating functions for several counting problems for compositions, palindromic compositions, Carlitz compo-sitions, and Carlitz palindromic compositions with <b>parts</b> <b>in</b> <b>A,</b> respectively. Our theorems contain many previously known results as special cases, as well as many new results. We also prove some of our results using direct counting arguments.
