50|$|The {{temperatures}} {{at which}} linear coal-fueled MHD generators can operate {{are limited by}} factors that include: (a) the combustion fuel, oxidizer, and oxidizer <b>preheat</b> <b>temperature</b> which limit the maximum temperature of the cycle; (b) the ability to protect the sidewalls and electrodes from melting; (c) the ability to protect the electrodes from electrochemical attack from the hot slag coating the walls combined with the high current or arcs that impinge on the electrodes as they carry off the direct current from the plasma; and (d) by the capability of the electrical insulators between each electrode. Coal-fired MHD plants with oxygen/air and high oxidant preheats would probably provide potassium seeded plasmas of about 4200 deg. F, 10 atmospheres pressure, and begin expansion at Mach 1.2. These plants would recover MHD exhaust heat for oxidant preheat, and for combined cycle steam generation. With aggressive assumptions, one DOE-funded feasibility study of where the technology could go, 1000 MWe Advanced Coal-Fired MHD/Steam Binary Cycle Power Plant Conceptual Design, published in June 1989, showed that a large coal-fired MHD combined cycle plant could attain a HHV energy efficiency approaching 60 percent—well in excess of other coal-fueled technologies, so the potential for low operating costs exists.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{analytically}} and experimentally {{the influence}} of <b>preheat</b> <b>temperature</b> on flame propagation and extinction of premixed methane-air flame in single quartz tubes with inner tube diameters of 3. 9, 3, 2 and 1 mm respectively. The effects of <b>preheat</b> <b>temperature,</b> tube diameter, equivalence ratio and mixture flow rate on the flame speed and extinction conditions are deter-mined. The analytical results show that high <b>preheat</b> <b>temperature</b> of the mixture can effectively suppress flame quenching, and the occurrence of stable solution in the slow flame branch extends the flammability limit leading to possible flame propagation in mini channels. Experimental results confirm that the flame speed increases and the flammability limit shifts toward the fuel lean direction either through increasing the <b>preheat</b> <b>temperature</b> or decreasing the mixture flow rate, or both. Decrease of propagating flame speed is observed before the stoichiometric equivalence ratio at high preheat temperatures. The analytical model provides insights into how propagating flame in mini channels can be sustained; however, the model is only good at predicting flame speed near the fuel lean branch. Influence of Cu 2 + ions exchanged zeolite 13 X catalyst on flame speed is also addressed.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Aim of {{the study}} was to analyze the mold filling {{capacity}} and the dimensional accuracy of a spinel-based investment for titanium castings. METHODS: Expansion of the investment in dependence of the <b>preheating</b> <b>temperature</b> was measured in a dilatometer. The degree of transformation of MgO and Al 2 O 3 to spinel (MgAl 2 O 4) was evaluated by means of X-ray powder diffraction. Mold filling capacity was assessed by casting a grid and calculating the percentage of completed segments. Dimensional accuracy was analyzed by casting a hollow cylinder and measuring the difference between the inner diameter of the resin pattern and the resulting titanium casting. RESULTS: Spinel formation starts at 819 degrees C. Diffraction patterns prove the formation of spinel from MgO and Al 2 O 3. The amount of spinel increases with increasing <b>preheating</b> <b>temperature.</b> The final expansion of the investment at the end of the preheating cycle at 450 degrees C shows a linear correlation to the maximum <b>preheating</b> <b>temperature.</b> The degree of mold filling is reciprocal to the <b>preheating</b> <b>temperature.</b> The dimensional accuracy shows a linear correlation to the amount of spinel. Best dimensional accuracy was obtained at about 900 degrees C. After a <b>preheating</b> <b>temperature</b> of 884 degrees C, as recommended by the manufacturer, the cast specimens showed a slightly lower inner diameter as compared to the resin patterns.

The thesis reports an experimental investigation concerned with the optimisation of mechanical properties in investment cast LM 25 aluminium alloy. The effects of melt hydrogen content, filter usage, grain refinement, eutectic silicon modification, heat treatment, pouring and shell preheat temperatures on the structure and tensile properties of LM 25 investment cast tensile test specimens were studied. Four series of experiments were conducted to assess {{the effects of the}} parameters studied on the structure and tensile properties. The first series established the effect of melt hydrogen content, pouring temperature and shell <b>preheat</b> <b>temperature</b> on the casting porosity, pore morphology and tensile properties.

The combustion and emissions characteristics of premixed NH 3 -air flame at preheating conditions were numerically investigated. The burning velocity and all species mole fraction were determined using the Miller and Bowman and the Reductive Konnov mechanism. The {{results show that}} both the equivalence ratio and <b>preheating</b> <b>temperature</b> have important effects on the laminar burning velocity and adiabatic flame temperature of NH 3. The reaction rate of production and mole fraction of H, O, and OH radicals, together with nitrogen radicals such as NH 2, NH, and N in the reaction zone, increases as the <b>preheating</b> <b>temperature</b> is increased from 298 to 573 K. Although NO concentrations in the exhaust gas increased with increasing <b>preheating</b> <b>temperature</b> under fuel-lean conditions, they could be maintained at a reasonably low level at all <b>preheating</b> <b>temperatures,</b> mainly due to the increased reduction reaction of NO with NH 2, NH, N radicals. The main N radical formation in the NH 3 -air combustion originates from NH 3 rather than N- 2, which indicates that the N- 2 dilution effect of NH 3 -air flame is negligible for NO formation. Furthermore, the equivalence ratio has a dominant effect on NO yields, because of the higher reduction reaction and lower flame temperature at higher equivalence ratio conditions, leading to a lower formation of HNO, which indicates a potential in reducing NO emissions in NH 3 combustion. Therefore, the <b>preheating</b> <b>temperature</b> and equivalence ratio should be given sufficient consideration in practical operations to minimize NO formation in combustion of NH 3 as a clean fuel...|$|R

A modified single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) procedure was applied to quartz grains of 35 ?View the MathML source diameter which were isolated using hydrofluorosilicic acid (H 2 SiF 6). ?Preheat plots? were constructed to select appropriate De values for use in subsequent age determinations.

However, the older (Pisgah Formation) samples showed a decrease in De values with increasing <b>preheat</b> <b>temperature,</b> {{by as much as}} a factor of two. Interestingly, both younger and older samples could recover a known laboratory administered radiation dose for a range of preheat temperatures.

To manufacture bimetallic casting goods cconsecutive centrifugal and gravity casting methods are commonly applied. Centrifugal and consecutive casting come up with geometrical constraints at the parting line of both materials. This research dealed with the manufacturing of tapered grinding roll by applying gravity casting method. The possibilities of casting the white cast iron outer ring in the preheated ductile cast iron of the inner ring were investigated. The inner ring was first heated up by casting liquid metal around the inner side, which prevented the inner ring from cracking due to rapid expansion during the casting process and to provide adequyate shrinkage of inner ring during solidification. After achieving the desired temperature of the inner ring, the liquid metal of white cast iron was then poured into the cavity to form the outer ring. The <b>preheating</b> <b>temperature</b> of the inner ring was mainly derived from the linear thermal expansion of both quasi isotrophic material and the diffusion at the parting line. This <b>preheating</b> <b>temperature</b> has to facilitate the formation of metallurgical bonding and avoid cracks due to the difference of shrinkage value between inner and outer ring. The <b>preheating</b> <b>temperature</b> {{was set up in}} the range of 500 °C - 1000 °C and the flushing time was fixed for 7 seconds.

XRD analysis showed that in this situation the amount of un-pyrolyzed precursor is low. Beyond this spray distance, spherical particles, are obtained and XRD analysis showed {{that most of the}} precursor is in un-pyrolyzed state...|$|E

Superalloy IN 718 large tube {{is used in}} {{critical}} jet engine applications, while manufacturing such components, the control of temperature during tube hot extrusion is of paramount importance. To determine the relation between technological factors and the temperature rise, extrusion force during tube hot extrusion of superalloy IN 718, a numerical model was developed to for the large tube hot extrusion through die and over mandrel. The constitutive behaviour of the material and friction at the extrusion temperatures are established as a thermoplastic process. In order to investigate the influence of technological parameters of extrusion process on the temperatures rise and extrusion force, then the extrusion variables such as friction factor, ram speed, tool and billet <b>preheating</b> <b>temperature</b> are taking into consideration. Besides tool <b>preheating</b> <b>temperature,</b> other parameters have a great influence on temperature rise of billet during the extrusion process. All of technological parameter of study in this paper have a significant influence on the extrusion force. Moreover, based on the simulation results, the case with tool <b>preheating</b> <b>temperature</b> of 300 °C should avoid during the technology making. ...|$|R
