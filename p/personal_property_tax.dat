5|$|During the 2007 {{legislative}} session, Rice sponsored 16 {{pieces of}} legislation, including 11 {{as the primary}} sponsor in the House of Representatives. Among {{the most prominent of}} his bills was a measure to set up a cold case unit within the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to investigate Colorado's 1200 unsolved homicides. After passage, Gov. Ritter signed the bill into law. Rice also pursued legislation to cut taxes for businesses by raising the <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> exemption. After having passed the state house unanimously, the measure died in a Senate committee.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, Bolger and the House passed {{legislation}} {{to improve the}} <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> system in Michigan. The <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> legislation, which was championed by the Lieutenant Governor Brian Calley, allows for 100 percent reimbursement to municipalities and an 80 percent reduction in business taxes based on the previous system.|$|E
25|$|In many jurisdictions (including many American states), {{there is}} a general tax levied {{periodically}} on residents who own personal property (personalty) within the jurisdiction. Vehicle and boat registration fees are subsets of this kind of tax. The tax is often designed with blanket coverage and large exceptions for things like food and clothing. Household goods are often exempt when kept or used within the household. Any otherwise non-exempt object can lose its exemption if regularly kept outside the household. Thus, tax collectors often monitor newspaper articles for stories about wealthy people who have lent art to museums for public display, because the artworks have then become subject to <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> <b>tax.</b> If an artwork had to be sent to another state for some touch-ups, it may have become subject to <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> in that state as well.|$|E
5000|$|Long slashed <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> <b>taxes</b> {{and reduced}} utility rates. His {{repeal of the}} poll tax in 1935 {{increased}} voter registration by 76 percent in one year. Long's popular homestead exemption eliminated <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> <b>taxes</b> {{for the majority of}} citizens by exempting properties valued at less than $2,000. His [...] "Debt Moratorium Act" [...] prevented foreclosures by giving people extra time to pay creditors and reclaim property without being forced to pay back-taxes. His personal intervention and strict regulation of the Louisiana banking system prevented bank closures and kept the system solventâ€”while 4,800 banks nationwide collapsed, only seven failed in Louisiana.|$|R
50|$|In 1948 Clermont County {{residents}} {{approved a}} vote to create a public library system. A seven member Board of Trustees was appointed in 1949, and library services began in 1955, after funds were raised from <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> <b>taxes</b> (a local tax on stocks and bonds).|$|R

25|$|All {{real and}} {{personal}} property {{located within the}} state of Connecticut is taxable unless specifically exempted by statute. All assessments are at 70% of fair market value. Another 20% of the value may be taxed by the local government though. The maximum property tax credit is $300 per return and any excess may not be refunded or carried forward. Connecticut does not levy an intangible <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> <b>tax.</b> According to the Tax Foundation, the 2010 Census data shows Connecticut residents paying the 2nd highest average property taxes in the nation with only New Jersey ahead of them.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent to the {{selection}} of the new location, the county board of supervisors reduced the amount of tax revenue collected annually through the merchants capital tax by 15% (11% in 2010, 2% in 2011, and 2% in 2012), this tax is determined by the value of inventory carried by a local business. In 2011 the county lost $599,690 in revenue provided by the federal government, and rather than adjust the annual budget or restore the merchants capital tax, the board approved a 16% <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> increase to raise an additional $666,141 of revenue for the county.|$|E
25|$|All real {{property}} and personal property {{is subject to}} tax unless specifically exempted by law. Personal property also is taxed, although most personal property owned by individuals is exempt. <b>Personal</b> <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> applies to personal property used when conducting business or to other personal property not exempt by law. All property taxes are paid to the county treasurer's office where the property is located. Washington does not impose a tax on intangible assets such as bank accounts, stocks or bonds. Neither does the state assess any tax on retirement income earned and received from another state. Washington does not collect inheritance taxes; however, the estate tax is decoupled from the federal estate tax laws, and therefore the state imposes its own estate tax.|$|E
5000|$|Orange {{operated}} {{on a budget}} of $8,034,744 for the 2013/2014 fiscal year, with revenue being composed of approximately 72% water/sewer utility payments, 8% real estate and <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> <b>taxes,</b> 13% taxes on prepared foods (a [...] "meals" [...] tax), and the remaining 7% from various other sources.|$|R

25|$|While governor, Bush {{presided over}} a state {{government}} that reduced taxes by 19 billion and he vetoed 2 billion in new spending, according to The Wall Street Journal. An analysis conducted by economist Martin Sullivan, which eliminated {{the effects of the}} federal estate tax repeal (which did not require legislative action to go into effect) and inflation, estimated the cumulative reduction in taxes by the state at closer to 13 billion during Bush's tenure, resulting in tax savings by 2006 of 140 per person, per year. A substantial amount of the tax savings in the higher estimate came from the phasing out of the federal estate tax law implemented in 2001 under President George W. Bush, for a total tax savings of 848 million per year; Jeb Bush did not push for a replacement with a state tax. The biggest reduction in taxes was due to the elimination of the state's Intangible <b>Personal</b> <b>Property</b> <b>Tax,</b> which applied to holdings of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and money market funds.|$|E
500|$|Rice re-introduced a {{bill that}} had passed the House but failed in the Senate the {{previous}} year to raise the business <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> exemption, after the measure was endorsed by Gov.

While in the legislature, Rice focused heavily on transportation issues and was a key sponsor of a 2009 transportation funding bill increasing vehicle registration fees {{in order to address}} a backlog of bridge and transportation requirements. [...] Other key measures he promoted included the creation of a statewide cold case homicide unit and a reduction in the business <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> <b>tax.</b>|$|E
