5|$|Another virtual safety car period ensued on lap 34, {{caused by}} Verstappen who crashed his {{car into the}} barrier after locking up his tyres. As the VSC ended on lap 37, Ricciardo once more failed {{in an attempt to}} regain the lead. At the chicane coming out of the tunnel, Hamilton misjudged the corner and backed Ricciardo off at the exit of the chicane, causing the latter to {{complain}} about the move on team radio. While the incident was investigated by the stewards, the decision was not to take action against Hamilton. At that point, the order stood as follows: Hamilton, Ricciardo, Pérez, Vettel, Alonso, Rosberg, Hülkenberg, Sainz, Button and Gutiérrez. The top four drivers pulled away cleanly {{from the rest of the}} field behind them. On lap 50, the two Sauber cars collided at Rascasse corner, after Felipe Nasr had ignored instructions from the pit lane to let his teammate Ericsson behind him pass. Another VSC period was called while both Sauber drivers made pit stops to repair damages, only for both to retire some laps later. In front, the race carried on in the same order. On lap 68, the fourth virtual safety car period occurred when a large <b>plastic</b> <b>sheet</b> fell onto the start–finish straight. Hamilton was able to extend his lead over Ricciardo at that point, setting the fastest lap of the race on lap 71. Three laps from the finish, rain started to fall again, although no driver changed tyres before the chequered flag fell. Hamilton crossed the finish line to take victory ahead of Ricciardo and Pérez. This win for Hamilton marked his second at Monaco, the other being in 2008. These two races featured many similarities, such as the Hamilton starting third on the grid, the race starting in wet conditions and finishing in the dry, as well as Hamilton taking the lead on lap 33. Vettel hung on to fourth, followed by Alonso in fifth. Rosberg however lost his sixth place to Nico Hülkenberg on the very last lap.|$|E

25|$|In May 2004, {{the group}} {{acquired}} Barlo Group PLC. This {{led to the}} announcement of the formation of Quinn Plastics on 1 January 2005. Barlo Plastics was created in 1998 by the merger of four <b>plastic</b> <b>sheet</b> producers and further expanded by four sheet extrusion companies in 1999 and 2000. The company's main business lies in the production of domestic and industrial transparent <b>plastic</b> <b>sheet</b> products, including building and construction, interior design and safety. It produces 90,000 tonnes annually and employs over 700 people. Headquartered in Derrylin, County Fermanagh, the company has operating facilities in Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Slovakia, the UK and the Czech Republic. In 2005, the company purchased Polyex, a UK start-up business that is now the base for their Alfreton production site. It provides products for many different applications. In October 2013, it was rebranded as Polycasa.|$|E

40|$|Modified cassava starch was {{prepared}} from the reaction between starch and maleic anhydride using sodium hydroxide as catalyst and water as solvent. After the reaction finished, {{the product was}} neutralized with hydrochloric acid solution. <b>Plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> can be prepared from the modified starch by casting. Preliminary studies on characteristics and some properties of these <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> were done using several techniques. It {{was found that the}} amount of maleic anhydride {{plays an important role in}} changing the chemical structures of the modified starch and the characteristics of the <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> whereas the reaction time does not affect them. The <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> are fully biodegradable. They are insoluble in typical solvents such as chloroform or in acidic solution at both room and elevated temperatures while they are soluble in hot basic solution. It was also found that modified starch-based <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> have lower glass transition temperatures, lower melting points, higher moisture absorption and higher hardness than unmodified starch-based <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets...</b>|$|R

25|$|Synthetic {{chemicals}} such as diethyltoluamide (often called DEET) {{dissolved in}} an oily carrier are sometimes used. Also {{there are various}} organic, botanical repellents such as citronella oil and neem oil. Typically various types of synthetic pyrethroids such as deltamethrin, cypermethrin, and permethrin are formulated in an oil or watery suspension suitable for application direct to the skin of animals at risk. This is usually done with a pour-on applicator along the back line of the host from where the insecticide spreads downwards through the hair coat. In addition, to protect against flies such as Stomoxys and Glossina species that feed on legs and belly the insecticide can be sprayed selectively to those regions. Also cattle can be treated using self-applicators such as back-rubbers made of large bundles of fiber impregnated with the insecticide, or in automatic walk-through sprayers. The same types of insecticides are also formulated into the <b>plastic</b> <b>sheet</b> of ear-tags for protecting cattle against Musca and similar flies feeding around the head of cattle. Insect growth regulators (juvenile hormones, chitin synthesis inhibitors, etc.) are available. For example, the insect growth regulator cyromazine is effective for the prevention or treatment of infestations with blowfly larvae. Botanical extracts such as azadirachtin from the neem tree can be formulated as repellents and insecticides, with the potential advantage of more rapid degradation to harmless forms in the environment, lower toxicity and potentially lower cost.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effect of}} various substrata on the {{settlement}} of a pearl oyster, Pinctada martensii, was evaluated. The settlement of the larvae in the experiments with four different color substrata was compared and showed that deep color <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> (red and blue) attracted significantly more larvae (P < 0. 05) than light color (green and yellow). In addition, the influence of biofilm substrata was {{compared with that of}} non-film substrata of smooth or rough texture. Number of settled larvae was highest on biofilmed <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets,</b> either rough or smooth, then rough <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> without film, the least recorded was on smooth <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> without biofilm. Substrates of <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> coated with tissue extracts of the same species appeared to attract larval settlement. The number of settled larvae on substrates with tissue extracts was significantly greater (P < 0. 05) than that on the control. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Soy protein <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> {{were made}} by extrusion. The effects of water, glycerol, methyl glucoside, ZnSO 4, epichlorohydrin, and glutaric dialdehyde on the {{mechanical}} properties of soy protein <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> were studied. The thermal transition temperatures and dynamic mechanical properties of soy protein plastics were also investigated. Depending on the moisture and glycerol contents, soy protein <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> displayed properties from rigid to soft. The glass transition temperatures of the sheets varied from ca. 27 to 508 C with moisture contents ranging from 26 to 2. 8 % and 30 parts of glycerol. The soy protein <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> were usually in their glassy states at room temperature unless they contained high moisture. The b-transitions of soy protein <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> ranged from 233 to 2728 C depending on the moisture. After being submerged in water for 20 h, the soy protein sheets absorbed up to 180 % water. With the presence of two parts of ZnSO 4, water absorption of the soy protein sheets decreased by 30 %. Soy protein sheets absorbed or lost moisture depending on the relativ...|$|R

Subsequently, in mid 2000, a limited 12" [...] vinyl was issued through Avex Trax in Japan to promote her second part of her 2000 concert tour. A picture disc that featured a shot of Hamasaki in a leather pink jacket included HΛL's 2000 remix on side one, and an orchestral version of the recording on side two. The artwork was photographed by Japanese photographer Toru Kumazawa, and featured Hamasaki sitting in a beige–colored circular pod with fabric around her.

[...] Rihanna and LaChapelle settled the case out of court for an undisclosed sum. After the case, LaChapelle said the lawsuit was [...] "not personal, it's strictly business", and that [...] "musicians commonly pay to sample music or use someone's beats and there should be no difference when sampling an artist's visuals." [...] In June 2011, German photographer Philipp Paulus sued Rihanna and her record labels, alleging further copyright violations with regard to a scene in the music video where Rihanna wears an expansive dress and is taped to the wall with a <b>plastic</b> <b>sheet</b> in front of her. According to Paulus, Rihanna and Matsoukas appropriated the image from his photographic series Paperworld.|$|E

500|$|The alien costume {{featured}} in Night of the Blood Beast {{was the same}} as the one used in another Roger Corman film, Teenage Caveman (1958). [...] This was done to save money, as the Cormans often tried to incorporate existing sets, costumes and other elements from previous films into new ones for financial savings. Varno said the Corman brothers were so conscious of their spending that [...] "'cheap' was the main word in their vocabulary". The monster costume scenes in Teenage Caveman and Night of the Blood Beast were shot within about two weeks of each other. The costume was modified slightly for Blood Beast; Varno claimed somebody on the set said [...] "the nose looks too Jewish", so it was cut down slightly to more resemble a beak. Ross Sturlin wore the costume for the scenes in both Teenage Caveman and Night of the Blood Beast. Filming was very difficult for Sturlin because it grew extremely hot inside the costume during the exterior shots. John Mathew Nickolaus, Jr. was director of photography for the film, and Jack Bohrer was the production manager. Daniel Haller, who {{went on to become a}} film director himself, worked as art director on Night of the Blood Beast. Haller did much of the manual construction work on the set himself, and brought a trailer in to the sound stage so he could sleep there and between work sessions. Among the props he built was the rocket-ship, the frame of which was made of plywood that had been cut into circles, then covered with a <b>plastic</b> <b>sheet</b> and spray-painted to look metallic. Haller also created blood cells that the characters looked at under a microscope, and the baby aliens (which resembled seahorses) they looked at under a fluoroscope. Alexander Laszlo composed the music for the film. Almost the entire crew went on to work on Attack of the Giant Leeches with the Corman brothers and Kowalski.|$|E

2500|$|At 4.20pm on Sunday 23 May 2010 an {{off-road}} motorcyclist spotted what {{he initially}} described as [...] "a sort of charred tailor's dummy" [...] in woodland at Monkey Hill, near Branchalfield Drive, Cambusnethan, Wishaw. As he approached he realised {{that it was}} actually a corpse. In his subsequent testimony he explained: [...] "At first I thought it was a mannequin and what struck me was the leg, possibly the left leg. I could see bone there. Tailor's dummies don't have bones." [...] The body was extensively charred, and he was unable to tell if it was that of a male or female. [...] He immediately went to his nearby home and telephoned the police to report the discovery. When the police arrived he led them to the scene, which Detective Sergeant (DS) Clifford Neil of Strathclyde Police described as [...] "gruesome." [...] The body lay on a makeshift pyre and had heavy duty <b>plastic</b> <b>sheet</b> partly melted on to the facial area.

2500|$|The first {{acrylic acid}} {{was created in}} 1843. Methacrylic acid, derived from acrylic acid, was {{formulated}} in 1865. The reaction between methacrylic acid and methanol results in the ester methyl methacrylate. Polymethyl methacrylate was discovered in the early 1930s by British chemists Rowland Hill and John Crawford at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in England. ICI registered the product under the trademark Perspex. About the same time, chemist and industrialist Otto Röhm of Rohm and Haas AG in Germany attempted to produce safety glass by polymerizing methyl methacrylate between two layers of glass. The polymer separated from the glass as a clear <b>plastic</b> <b>sheet,</b> which Röhm gave the trademarked name Plexiglas in 1933. Both Perspex and Plexiglas were commercialized in the late 1930s. In the United States, E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (now DuPont Company) subsequently introduced its own product under the trademark Lucite. In 1936 Imperial Chemical Industries (now Lucite International) began the first commercially viable production of acrylic safety glass. During World War II both Allied and Axis forces used acrylic glass for submarine periscopes and aircraft windshields, canopies, and gun turrets. [...] Airplane pilots whose eyes were damaged by flying shards of PMMA fared much better than those injured by standard glass, demonstrating better compatibility between human tissue and PMMA than glass. Civilian applications followed after the war.|$|E
