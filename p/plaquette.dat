40|$|Cuprate {{high-temperature}} superconductors {{exhibit a}} pseudogap {{in the normal}} state that decreases monotonically with increasing hole doping and closes at x ≈ 0. 19 holes per planar CuO 2 while the superconducting doping range is 0. 05 < x < 0. 27 with optimal Tc at x ≈ 0. 16. Using ab initio quantum calculations at the level that leads to accurate band gaps, we found that four-Cu-site <b>plaquettes</b> are created {{in the vicinity of}} dopants. At x ≈ 0. 05 the <b>plaquettes</b> percolate, so that the Cu dx 2 y 2 /O pσ orbitals inside the <b>plaquettes</b> now form a band of states along the percolating swath. This leads to metallic conductivity and below Tc to superconductivity. <b>Plaquettes</b> disconnected from the percolating swath are found to have degenerate states at the Fermi level that split and lead to the pseudogap. The pseudogap can be calculated by simply counting the spatial distribution of isolated <b>plaquettes,</b> leading to an excellent fit to experiment. This provides strong evidence in favor of inhomogeneous <b>plaquettes</b> in cuprates. Comment: 24 pages (4 pages main text plus 20 pages supplement...|$|R

2500|$|Except for heraldic animals, putti and {{decorative}} masks, figurative decoration was relatively unusual until {{the advent of}} porcelain or enamel in the 18th century, but a group of English services of the 1680s use the same <b>plaquette</b> designs, of uncertain origin, {{on the tops of}} round and rectangular boxes, as well as elaborate cast and chased decoration of foliage and putti.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} charge {{properties of}} (undoped) cuprate compounds from a theoretical point of view. The central question considered here is: How does the dimensionality of the CU-O sub-structure influence its charge degrees of freedom? The model {{used to describe}} the Cu-O sub-structure is the three- (or multi-) band Hubbard model. Analytical approaches are employed (ground-state formalism for strongly correlated systems, Mori-Zwanzig projection technique) as well as numerical simulations (Projector Quantum Monte Carlo, exact diagonalization). Several results are compared to experimental data. The following materials have been chosen as candidates to represent different Cu-O sub-structures: Bi 2 CuO 4 (isolated CuO 4 <b>plaquettes),</b> Li 2 CuO 2 (chains of edge-sharing <b>plaquettes),</b> Sr 2 CuO 3 (chains of corner-sharing <b>plaquettes),</b> and Sr 2 CuO 2 Cl 2 (planes of <b>plaquettes).</b> Several results presented in this thesis are valid for other cuprates as well. Two different aspects of charge properties are analyzed: 1) Charge properties of the ground state 2) Charge excitations. (gekürzte Fassung...|$|R
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{model of}} interacting <b>plaquettes</b> is studied {{by means of}} the real space renormalization group approach. Interactions between the <b>plaquettes</b> are mediated solely by spin excitations on the <b>plaquettes.</b> Depending on the plaquette-plaquette coupling J, we find two regimes: "confinement" J_c< J≤ 1, where the singlet ground state forms an infinite ("confined") cluster in the thermodynamical limit. Here the singlet-triplet gap vanishes, which is the signature for long range spin-spin correlators. "deconfinement" 0 ≤ J< J_c, where the singlet ground state "deconfines" - i. e. factorizes - into finite n-clusters of size 2 ^n× 2 ^n, with n≤ n_c(J). Here the singlet-triplet gap is finite.

Suppression of the 1 / 2 -defects on the square <b>plaquettes</b> in the P 2 model leads to complete elimination of the phase transition observed in this model. However in the P 4 model, on suppressing the single 1 / 2 -defects on square <b>plaquettes,</b> the otherwise first order phase transition changes to a second order one which occurs at a higher temperature and this is due to presence of large number of 1 / 2 -pair defects which are left within the square <b>plaquettes.</b> When we suppressed these charges too, complete elimination of phase transition was observed. ...|$|R
