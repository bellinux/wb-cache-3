40|$|Since the Renaissance, the {{normative}} {{approach to a}} philosophy of music has concerned itself primarily with the subjective experience of the listener. This was not always the case. From Greek Antiquity to the Renaissance, music was considered a rigorous, mathematical discipline that shed light on objective truths concerning cosmology and cosmogony. Musica theorica, therefore, took precedence over musica practica and was taken much more seiously in musical scholarship. Although tension had always existed between Musica theorica and Musica practica, such tension reached its peak during the Renaissance and as a result, a shift occurred: Musica theorica was pushed into the background, and Musica practica stepped forward. The intention of this thesis is to convince its reader {{of the need to}} bring Musica theorica back to its proper place in musical and philosphical scholarship, where objective answers can be found, and music's innate eternal nature is revealed. The thesis begins with a historical survey of musical scholarship that eventually brings the reader {{to the center of the}} controversy that ensued during the Renaissance, and then forward to present day discussions in <b>philosphy</b> <b>of</b> music that are concerned with music's subjective and temporal properties. It is hoped that the reader will see the need for a new shift to occur in philosophy of music that focuses on music's objective and eternal properies (that are wholly distinct from the subject experiencing it), and will come away with a new perspective regarding the interdisciplinary nature <b>of</b> <b>philosphy</b> and music...|$|R

The essence is that human being enables to control the economic environment as well as to improve the life quality. There are four basic Islamic teachings dealing with the <b>philosphy</b> <b>of</b> Islamic economic development:   ta w hîd, rubûbiyah, khalîfah and tazkiyah. The principle of   tauhîd is to prevent a concentrated economy power.   khalîfah principle is to guard against environmet damage and to protect natural sources conservation. The principle of   tazkiyah to prohibit social imbalance and to realize equality and justice. Accordingly, it can give shape to a continuity development. The concept of continuity development is essentially the implementation of the principle of rubûbiyah, it is the priciple of education, maintenance, and continuity to the perfectness, as the principle of  divinity (ilahi). Hence, if the four principles are realized in the Indonesian economic development, government will easily create the nation’s ambition, a prosperous and justice nation.   Key Words: ekonomi Islam, homo economicus, dan pembangunan ekonomi</p...|$|R

The main purpose is then to find whether Brno established its own architectonic tradition and style in the 1920 s and 1930 s, and if so whether the tradition is prominent to this day and how. This essay does not follow a timeline, bbut begins with describing the revolutionary era in 1989. First it is described what was happening in Czech respectively in Brno's architecture in the years from 1945 to 1989, followed by the events of the revolutionary year of 1989 and how it shaped up and influnced the years there after. The second chapter will take us back to the era in between the two World Wars and describe how the architecture and the city itself changed. The term 'funcionalism in Brno' is described in this chapter by showing few examples of buildings and architecs.

40|$|Philosophical and {{physiological}} investigations define {{thought to be}} the result of thinking. psychological Inquiry has mainly focused on discovery of the mechanisms and topology <b>of</b> <b>thought.</b> Philosophical Inquiry either has explored the mind-body problem or has analyzed the linguistics of the expression <b>of</b> a <b>thought.</b> However, neither has Investigated adequately phenomenal characteristics <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> Itself, the Intermediary between the production and the expression <b>of</b> a <b>thought.</b> The use <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> to analyze phenomenal characteristics <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> engenders a paradox. If the expression <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> requires finite series of linked words with rules governing syntax, then analysis <b>of</b> both the <b>thought</b> and the expression <b>of</b> the <b>thought</b> must necessarily transcend the linguistic level. During the last century many examples of logical paradoxes In linguistics <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> have been given. The culminating difficulty of dealing with a finite structure, a characteristic of any language, Is Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, which says in essence that in order to render all decisions about a finite system requires the use of material outside the system. Thus, a potentially complete interpretation <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> must use some technique which is basically non-linguistic. Wittgenstein proposed such a method with his "Picture theory.

40|$|Chronic {{wounds and}} {{excessive}} scarring are two distinct pathologies that arise when the dynamic and tightly-regulated wound-healing response is disrupted. Both are considered recalcitrant conditions, which are refractory to current therapies and susceptible to {{high rates of}} recurrence. Propolis and cerumen, plant-derived products of honeybees and stingless bees, respectively, possess {{a broad array of}} biological properties, justifying their use as traditional medicines since antiquity. In particular, they exert anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and wound-healing effects; and early evidence suggests that therapeutically-applied propolis may provide benefit in cases of chronic wounds and excessive scarring. The mega-diverse Australian landscape and the species-rich nature of its ecosystems may be abundant sources of natural products for novel wound-healing agents. The Australian native stingless bee, Tetragonula carbonaria, represents a novel source of cerumen; the bioactivities of which are largely unknown. Therefore, the work described in this thesis aimed to determine the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties of T. carbonaria cerumen, identify its bioactive constituents; and evaluate its potential to provide benefit in cases of pathological wound-healing.

40|$|In New Zealand, {{residential}} {{problems related}} to old age are of concern due to the increasing population of older people and the challenges that aging brings. These challenges include generational social expectations and intergenerational living, accompanied by cultural traditions of family, living and the home environment. It is becoming common for younger generations to live away from their elderly family members in the western world, which can cause psychological, financial and safety issues for the older generation. In New Zealand's aging population, which includes Maori, Samoan and Asian people, these aging issues are approached in culturally specific ways. This design-led research report explores 'filial piety', an ancient Chinese philosophy, {{in the context of}} an industrial design practice that embraces established principles and design processes related to product design, ergonomics, emotional design and universal design. The design emerged out of an observation that the New Zealand domestic environments do not typically allow for or attend to modes of intergenerational living, a societal attribute common in China where the <b>philosphy</b> <b>of</b> 'filial piety' leads families and their homes to be more generous and responsive to the physical and spiritual needs of all, in particular, the needs of the elderly.
