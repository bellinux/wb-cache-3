50|$|Self-estrangement in workers manifests in {{feelings}} of working {{just for a}} salary, doing one's job just {{to get it out}} of the way, or doing work to please others. Although self-estrangement is a small factor, it still contributes to alienation, which contributes strongly to burnout at work. Self-estrangement may provoke different forms of <b>psychic</b> <b>distress</b> that potentially evoke symptoms of burnout, or manifestations of stress that ruin work life. Self-estrangement and lack of meaning in one's work provokes a different form of <b>psychic</b> <b>distress</b> that evokes symptoms of burnout. According to Marx's theory of alienation, a worker can feel self-estranged from their work, their production, and other workers. This means that the person loses interest in why they are working, which can decrease their production and cause them to alienate themselves from other workers as well. The worker doesn't feel like he is a part of the workplace, therefore isolating himself from his work and others.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Benzodiazepine anti-anxiety {{agents are}} the most widely {{prescribed}} psychotherapeutic drugs in the United States today. Recent evidence, however, suggests that their use may be decreasing. METHODS: We examine the population prevalence and correlates of use of benzodiazepine anxiolytics at the Duke site of the NIMH-sponsored Epidemiologic Catchment Area project. RESULTS: Bivariate analysis of use patterns for the drugs revealed demographic predictors similar to those reported in previous studies: increased likelihood of use by the elderly, Whites, women, the less educated, and the separated or divorced. Use is also associated with symptoms of <b>psychic</b> <b>distress,</b> negative life events, use of health care services, and diagnoses of affective disorder, agoraphobia with panic, and panic disorder. Age, sex, race, education, and marital status remain associated with non-hypnotic benzodiazepine use in a logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Multivariate analyses of these data indicate that when potential confounding factors are controlled, age, sex, race, education, and marital status are significantly related to benzodiazepine anxiolytic use but the effects of sex and education are mediated by intervening variables. Implications of these findings are discussed particularly in relation {{to high levels of}} use in the elderly...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Trauma theory posits an unrepresentable excess to experience, {{but because}} most studies of trauma deal with {{experiences}} that are known and named, at least in general terms (for instance, the Holocaust), {{there is a tendency}} to treat the limits of representation as objective borders determined by the inherent character of specific events rather than as subjective borders determined by the way an event is experi-enced. In this essay I propose a different model. Taking as my example the work of Emily Dickinson—a poet whose descriptions of <b>psychic</b> <b>distress,</b> often presumed to be autobiographical, have no known basis in the historical record—I argue that the limits of representation are best conceived as functions of the limits of inten-tion.

40|$|Introduction: Over {{the last}} few years, our Tinnitus Research Group has {{identified}} {{an increasing number of}} patients with tinnitus who also complained of repeated perception of complex sounds, such as music and voices. Such hallucinatory phenomena motivated us to study their possible relation to the patients' psyches. Aims: To assess whether hallucinatory phenomena were related to the patients' psychosis and/or depression, and clarify their content and function in the patients' psyches. Method: Ten subjects (8 women; mean age = 65. 7 years) were selected by otolaryngologists and evaluated by the same psychologists through semi-structured interviews, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and psychoanalysis interviews. Results: We found no association between auditory hallucinations and psychosis; instead, this phenomenon was associated with depressive aspects. The patients' discourse revealed that hallucinatory phenomena played unconscious roles in their emotional life. In all cases, there was a remarkable and strong tendency to recall/repeat unpleasant facts/situations, which tended to exacerbate the distress caused by the tinnitus and hallucinatory phenomena and worsen depressive aspects. Conclusions: There is an important relationship between tinnitus, hallucinatory phenomena, and depression based on persistent recall of facts/situations leading to <b>psychic</b> <b>distress.</b> The knowledge of such findings represents a further step towards the need to adapt the treatment of this particular subgroup of tinnitus patients through interdisciplinary teamwork.

40|$|Psychoanalysis is {{primarily}} a praxis devoted to curing <b>psychic</b> <b>distress.</b> While human geographers are well acquainted with the theoretical insights of psychoanalysis, there are few spatial analyses of how its theories are put to work in its clinical methods, techniques and practices. The thesis {{of this paper is}} that an investigation of the intense spatialities in psychoanalytic sessions can further understandings of psychoanalytic theory and its relevance to critical geographic inquiry. I argue that the transferential forces of play, desire and affect in Donald Winnicott and Jacques Lacan’s psychoanalytic treatment of analysands is a realization of, or at least comparable to what Friedrich Nietzsche called a ‘gay science’. In proposing a historical precedent to psychoanalysis, I draw on a constellation of meanings associated with the category ‘gay ’ in order to map some spatial nuances of psychoanalytic praxis. The paper focuses on the case studies of Winnicott’s ‘re-mothering ’ of a male analysand and contemporary Lacanian analyses of hysterics and autistic children. In striving for clinical efficacy, these psychoanalyses utilize, on the one hand, the gaiety of joy, love, desire and mothering, and, on the other hand, the not-so-gay, yet therapeutic, forces of pain, aggressiveness, separation and mourning.

A rational scale was developed in an earlier study to operationally define the theoretical stages of change.

The principal component, internal consistency, and cluster profile analyses demonstrated a replication of the original findings. The stages (Pre-Contemplation, Contemplation, Action, and Maintenance) were examined in relation to therapist ratings of treatment outcome. As predicted, Pre-Contemplators showed significantly less progress than subjects in the other three stages. This study also examined the relationships among stages of change and the six DSM-III diagnostic categories most frequently assigned to subjects in the present study (i. e., depression, adjustment disorder, paranoia, mixed affective disorder, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder). Schizophrenics, paranoids, and subjects with adjustment disorders scored higher on Pre-Contemplation than subjects with other diagnoses.

40|$|Background: The Burnout Syndrome (BS) is {{a common}} {{condition}} among health care professionals, yet data concerning its prevalence and associated factors among psychiatric residents are lacking. Objectives: To report {{the results of the}} Italian contribution to "BOSS", an international multicentre research project aiming at estimating the burden of BS among residents in psychiatry, and at identifying factors contributing to its development and prevention. Methods: Cross-sectional study. The BOSS online questionnaire, which collected socio-demographic data and five psychometric tools (MBI-GS, AWLS, PHQ- 9, SIBQ, BFI), was administered electronically to 180 Italian residents in psychiatry. Simple and multiple linear regressions were erformed to analyse data. Results: 108 questionnaires provided data for the study (response rate: 60 %). Mean age: 30. 5 ± 3. 7 years. Eighty percent of the sample were female. A moderate level of BS emerged, related to work conditions, absence of major depression, satisfaction with pay or less academic activity. Only 0. 9 % (N= 1) of the sample showed PHQ- 9 scores suggestive of major depression, while lifetime suicidal ideation was admitted by 16 % of residents. For the three dimensions of the MBIGS, Italian sample scores were consistent with previously published results concerning pooled data in a French- Croatian sample, reporting moderate levels of BS. Higher workload, symptoms of depression and lower satisfaction predicted higher levels of Emotional Exhaustion and Cynicism.

This article investigates how bereaved and traumatised populations experience research participation, and they voice their recommendations for future research. The data are from a nationwide three-phase study in Norway among parents who had lost their child by suicide, SIDS, and accidents between July 1, 1997 and December 31, 1998. Whereas the first phase reported quantitative results of perceived psychosocial health and focused on offered and ideal support (N= 262), the second phase investigated the same issues through in-depth interviews of a sub sample (N= 69). Phase three, reported here, included the responses of 64 parents to a short questionnaire evaluating research participation in the two previous phases. The results show that 100 % of the parents experienced participation as "positive"/"very positive", and none regretted participating. They linked the positive experiences to being allowed to tell their complete story, the format of the interview, and a hope that they might help others. Apparently, processes of meaning reconstruction and increased awareness of the bereavement process were facilitated by the interviews. However, three-quarters of the interviewees reported that it was {{to a greater or lesser}} degree painful to talk about the traumatic loss. Regression analysis showed that being a woman and high levels of <b>psychic</b> <b>distress</b> were the most important predictors of a painful interview experience.

40|$|Aim: To analyse the {{relationships}} between mental health and employment commitment among prisoners and the long-term unemployed (LTU) trying to return to work. Method: Fifty-two of 62 male inmates of a semi-open prison (Givenich Penitentiary Centre, the only such unit in Luxembourg), and 69 LTU registered at the Luxembourg Employment Administration completed a questionnaire exploring: 1) mental health (measured by means of scales GHQ 12 and CES-D); 2) employment commitment; 3) availability of a support network, selfesteem, empowerment; and 4) socio-demographic characteristics. Results: Compared with LTU, inmates were younger, more had work experience (54. 9 % vs 26. 1 %), and more were educated to only a low level (71. 1 % vs 58. 0 %). The link between employment commitment and mental health in the LTU was the opposite of that seen among the prisoners: the more significant the perceived importance of employment, the worse the mental health (GHQ 12 p = 0. 003; CES-D p < 0. 001) of the LTU; in contrast, among prisoners, the GHQ 12 showed that the greater the perceived value of work, the lower the <b>psychic</b> <b>distress</b> (p = 0. 012). Greater empowerment was associated with less depression in both populations. The education levels {{of people who did}} not reach the end of secondary school, whether inmates or LTU, were negatively linked with their mental equilibrium. Conclusion: The two groups clearly need professional support. Future research should further investigate the link between different forms of professional help and mental health. Randomized controlled trials could be carried out in both groups, with interventions to improve work commitment for prisoners and to help with getting a job for LTU.

40|$|Negligence {{liability}} on {{the part}} of a psychiatrist belongs among high-complexity fields, for both the judge and his or her technical consultants. In most instances, there are no scientific grounds in order to ascribe with reasonable certainty liability to medical personnel and nursing staff, while often judges tend to stretch the concept of “protection” to a degree to which the psychiatrist is deemed to have a legal obligation to stave off the development of any adverse consequence which <b>psychic</b> <b>distress</b> may bring upon the patient. The case-records pertaining to suicide are symptomatic of such a tendency {{on the part}} of the Supreme Court as to convict healthcare professionals, the lack of incontrovertible evidence notwithstanding. The authors of this paper expound and elaborate on the conditions needed to ascribe liability to the psychiatrist, and the cause and effect relationship between the doctor’s professional behavior and the patient’s eventual suicide. On such basis, several sentences are perused in which the failure to institutionalize, the discharging of a patient, the granting of leaves and an obligation to supervise all come into play, highlighting how suicide is far too complex an outcome to be rationalized into the principle of causality beyond the reasonable doubt, as dictated by the criminal procedure codes, neither can it be kept from happening through the patients’ loss of personal liberty. Within such a legal framework, what becomes apparent is the inadequateness of any set of standardized rules and laws regulating professional liability, and its inability to properly take into account the complexities and peculiarities inherent to psychiatry. Consequently, a proper overhaul of such proceedings appears to be urgent, via a newly devised set of provisions, crafted to provide a new array of undisputable, basic behavioral standards, the breaching of which would entail the sanctioning {{on the part of}} the lawful authorities of such violations, even in absence of the suicide of a patient, or persisting the inability to demonstrate a cause-effect relationship...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. So far, {{studies of}} stress {{have shown that}} {{physicians}} are at {{a high risk of}} sickness from psychic and somatic disorders related to professional stress, that can lead to important disturbance of personal, familiar and professional functionating. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the doctors exposition level to professional stress, to compare stress level in general practitioners (GP) group with that in the group of psychiatrists and risk level for the apperance of burnout syndrome. Methods. This cross-section study included subjects recruited by a random sample method. Thirty General Practice doctors and 30 psychiatrists (totally 60 doctors) filled the set of 3 questionnaires: Sociodemographics features, General Health Questionnaire (GHQ; Goldberg D, 1991), and Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI; Maslach C, 1996). Appropriate statistical procedures (Pearson test, t-test, variance analysis) in interpretation of the results were used. Results. A total level of <b>psychic</b> <b>distress</b> measured with the GHQ test in both groups of physicians was very low implying their good mental health. A difference in Burnout risk based on MBI test between the groups was statistically significant (χ 2 = 4, 286; p < 0. 05) only at subscale Personal Accomplishment (MBI-PA); it was a consequence of a higher number of GPs with medium burnout risk (13. 3 : 0. 0 %). However, even 35 physicians from the sample were affected with a high burnout risk measured with subscales Emotional Ehausation (MBI-EE) and MBI-DP, showing that both groups of physicians had risk for the appearance of burnout syndrome. Conclusion. The obtained results showed a high burnout risk level in both, GPs and psychiatrists, groups. In both groups there was no presence of psychic disorders (anxiety, depression, insomnia), while there was a high level of emotional ehausation and overtension by job, and also a lower total personal accomplishment.

Following the example of the five - nation European (EPSILON) study, we explored the following research question: How does the relationship between domains of caregiving (as in the Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire - IEQ-EU) and caregiver <b>psychic</b> <b>distress</b> on the one hand, and caregiver's/patient's socio-demographics, clinical features and indices of quality of care, on the other hand, compare with the pattern in the literature? Method Consecutive family caregivers of outpatients with schizophrenia were interviewed with the IEQ-EU. Patients were interviewed with measures of needs for care, service satisfaction, quality of life (QOL) and psychopathology. Results There were 121 caregivers (66. 1 % men, aged 39. 8). The IEQ domain scores (total: 46. 9; tension: 13. 4; supervision: 7. 9; worrying: 12. 9; and urging: 16. 4) were in the middle of the range for the EU data. In regression analyses, higher burden subscale scores were variously associated with caregiver lower level of education, patient's female gender and younger age, as well as patient's lower subjective QOL and needs for hospital care, and not involving the patient in outdoor activities. Disruptive behavior was the greatest determinant of global rating of burden. Conclusion Our results indicate that, despite differences in service set-up and culture, the IEQ-EU can be used in Kuwait as it has been used in the western world, to describe the pattern of scores on the dimensions of caregiving. Differences with the international data reflect peculiarities of culture and type of service. Despite generous national social welfare provisions, experience of burden was the norm and was significantly associated with patient's disruptive behavior. The results underscore the need for provision of community - based programs and continued intervention with the families in order to improve the quality of care. </p...|$|E

A experiência envolve a tessitura de redes de conversações entre aqueles que convivem com Philip, um menino encaminhado ao Atendimento Educacional Especializado (AEE), a partir do diagnóstico de autismo, uma das formas de dizer no campo do Transtorno Global de Desenvolvimento (TGD). O espaço de acolhimento proposto teve como intenção ampliar a forma de viver e de aprender de Philip. As intervenções surgem e se desenham a partir da invenção do brincar e se tornam visíveis no encontro do olhar, no sorriso, no manuseio dos objetos da vida comum e, fundamentalmente, na interação com as pessoas ao seu entorno. A inserção e invenção do/no espaço educativo tem o propósito de transformar o sofrimento em vida e possibilidades de aprendizagem. O resultado deste trabalho forja transformações estruturais na convivência entre Philip e todos aqueles em interação com ele. Redes de conversação, quando tecidas em rizoma, permitem a construção de saberes capazes de sustentar outro modo de viver. This article {{analyzes}} {{the ways of}} organizing life and the learning processes of a boy experiencing <b>psychic</b> <b>distress</b> and social abandonment {{from the moment he}} receives care at a school facility. The experience involves the organization of a network of conversations among those who live with Philip, a boy who was referred to the Special Education Services (SES) based on the autism diagnosis, one of the disorders in the category of Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD). The assistance center proposed was aimed at expanding the way of living and learning of Philip. The interventions come up and develop themselves from the invention of playing and become visible through eye contact, smiles, when handling objects that are part of everyday life and mainly by interacting with people around him. The insertion and invention of/in the educational space is aimed at transforming the suffering in life and learning possibilities. The result of this work creates structural transformations in the coexistence between Philip and all the individuals that interact with him. When consolidated conversation networks enable the construction of knowledge areas that are able to support another way of living...|$|E

Para garantir a materialidade dessas mudanÃas, faz-se necessÃria a participaÃÃo efetiva dos usuÃrios na avaliaÃÃo de serviÃos e programas de saÃde mental. Destarte, esta investigaÃÃo objetiva compreender as experiÃncias de usuÃrios em dois Centros de AtenÃÃo Psicossocial (CAPS) de Fortaleza-CearÃ, no que {{concerne}} Ã assistÃncia conferida pelos profissionais, exprimindo destaque Ãs dimensÃes integralidade e humanizaÃÃo do cuidado em saÃde. A escolha da abordagem qualitativa como metodologia desta pesquisa estÃ relacionada Ã natureza ontolÃgica do objeto em foco, visto que esta Ã permeada de significados que os usuÃrios atribuem Ãs suas experiÃncias nos serviÃos de saÃde mental e Ã maneira como compreendem e interpretam as prÃticas assistenciais. As tÃcnicas utilizadas para a obtenÃÃo do material empÃrico foram a entrevista em profundidade e a observaÃÃo nÃo estruturada, nos meses de julho a dezembro de 2011. Os dados foram analisados e interpretados sob a Ãptica da HermenÃutica-crÃtica gadameriana, cujo mÃtodo {{assume a}} intersubjetividade na interconexÃo com a materialidade a que se vincula de maneira dialÃtica. Os resultados evidenciaram trÃs temas centrais que constituÃram a Rede de Significados: A) ExperiÃncias dos itinerÃrios terapÃuticos; B) PercepÃÃo dos usuÃrios sobre o serviÃo; e C) Qualidade do cuidado. Destaca-se o impacto dos diferentes modelos asilar e psicossocial na experiÃncia vivida dos usuÃrios dos distintos CAPS. Observou-se, tambÃm, que os usuÃrios percebem o acolhimento, a resolubilidade, a ambiÃncia, a boa interaÃÃo dos profissionais-usuÃrios, o agenciamento de medicamentos e a humanizaÃÃo como os principais aspectos concernentes ao atendimento de qualidade em saÃde mental - embora tais questÃes, em alguns momentos, tenham se revelado de maneira singular nos dois dispositivos desta pesquisa. Conclui-se que, apesar de alguns entraves, os aspectos da assistÃncia apontados pelos usuÃrios dos distintos CAPS corroboram os ideais da Reforma PsiquiÃtrica e sinalizam que a reorientaÃÃo do modelo de atenÃÃo em saÃde mental jÃ se capilariza no cotidiano das prÃticas de cuidado. The implementation of public mental health {{policies in the}} context of the Unified Health System (SUS), based on the precepts of the Psychiatric Reform, has generated new challenges for the mental health area such as the deployment of territorial and substitutive networks aiming the overcoming of the hospital-centered model, the development of the citizenship and the creation of a new social site for experiencing the <b>psychic</b> <b>distress.</b> To guarantee the materiality of changes, it is necessary the effective participation of users in the evaluation of mental health programs and services. Thus, the current research aims to understand the user experiences of two CAPS (Center for Psychosocial Care) in the Fortaleza city, concerning to the care provided by professionals, highlighting the dimensions comprehensiveness and the humanization on the health care. Regarding the methodology of this research, the choice for the qualitative approach is related to the ontological nature of the research object because this nature is pervaded by meanings which the users pose on their experiences on health care services and the way how they understand and interpret such care practices. The techniques used to obtain the empirical material were the detailed interview and the unstructured observation, in a time period of two months, from July to December 20011. The data were analyzed and interpreted under the perspective of the GadamerÂs critique hermeneutics whose method assumes the inter-subjectivity in the interconnection with the materiality to which it binds in a dialectic manner. The results revealed three central themes which constitute the Network of Meanings: A) The experiences on therapeutics itinerary; B) the user perception on the services, C) The quality of the care. We highlight the impact of the distinct models, hospital-centered and psychosocial, in the experience lived by distinct CAPS users. We also observed that the user perceive the embracement, the resolvability, the ambience, the good interaction between professionals and users, the monitoring of medicines and the humanization as the main aspects concerning to the quality of mental health care, although such issues had presented themselves in a singular way in the two CAPS investigated. We conclude that, despite some obstacle, the aspects of care pointed by users of the distinct CAPS corroborate the ideals of the Psychiatric Reform and signalize that the reorientation of the health care model already makes capillary in the daily care practices...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAgeing {{is due to}} a {{progressive}} loss of the person's adaptation capability, whereas during this period environmental aggression increases. In the elderly, life events re-present a psychological traumatism that overwhelms the old person and related family, disrupting and fragilising homeostatic balance. A number of authors have suggested a possible link between life traumatisms and the dementia processes. The aim {{of this study is to}} reveal the presence of life traumatisms preceding the apparition of the dementia syndrome. Method. This is a retrospective and comparative work based on the PIXEL study on complaints and demands from the principle informal caregivers of Alzheimer patients. It includes 565 patients presenting the criterion of dementia as defined by the DSM IV, and questionnaires filled out by the principle caregivers. One item of the questionnaire referred to life events which could have played a part in the development of the disorder. In a second stage, the reported events were classified into 4 distinct categories: loss, repeated or prolonged stress, psychotraumatism and depression-inducing events. The statistics were produced using SAS and Stat 10 software. Student's test, ANOVA and chi 2 -test were used. RESULTS: 372 caregivers answered the first item (65 %); 76 of them believed there was no event while 296 related the disorder to one or several life events (79 % of responders, 52 % of the sample). These results confirm Persson and Clement's study which evidenced a higher frequency of stressing life events for subjects afflicted with dementia as compared with older people without any psychic disorder. Reported events and their respective frequency: spouse death (15. 39 %), parents' death (15 %), familial difficulty (10. 08 %), anaesthesia (8. 49 %), child's death (4. 42 %), somatic disturbance (4 %), depression (3. 89 %), retirement (3. 89 %), financial problems (2. 65 %), loneliness (2. 65 %), removal (1. 76 %), fall (1 %), alcohol (0. 8 %), traumatism (0. 53 %), spouse care (0. 35 %), leaving for home care, storm and caregiver change in life (0. 17 %). Regrouping the data: 82. 71 % of the answers can be connected to prolonged stress, 62. 85 % to real or symbolic loss, 39 % to a psychotraumatic event and finally, most of these events can potentially induce depression. DISCUSSION: Some of the events refer to difficulties concerning people close to the subject (death of a close relation, hospitalisation of husband or wife) in a period when the loss of autonomy or handicap means greater dependence on surrounding people. General anaesthesia is mentioned by 48 caregivers. In fact, this usually implies surgery, the presence of organic pathology or the need for hospitalisation, which we know has a destabilizing effect in the elderly. It is therefore not surprising that 23 answers mentioned somatic disorders (4 % of the sample). According to Leger, it's mostly a loss type event which is implied in the elderly. Such losses would induce a weakening of cognitive stimulation which could decompensate an infraclinical dementia or accelerate an emerging dementia process. Antecedents of depressive illness are considered as an element of risk for the development of Alzheimer's disease. Depression is spontaneously mentioned by 22 caregivers. We must add the many reported life events which are well known to induce depression in older people. Most of the events considered in this study are liable to provoke manic mood swings. Depression resulting from life events can be considered either as an affection occurring along with dementia or as the aggravating factor of an infraclinical process or, finally, as an additional factor of vulnerability. With older people, many events may constitute a trauma because of the proximity of death and because of their sudden onset (fall, hospitalisation, somatic illness). Several studies have pointed out that a particularly traumatic event could enhance the risk of dementia. Life events associated with chronic or repeated stress are characterized by their permanence or their repetition. According to a general psychosomatic biological pattern, <b>psychic</b> <b>distress</b> will engender a series of degradations or an acute or chronic response to an early trauma. According to this hypothesis, prolonged exposure to an excess of glucocorticosteroids at the time of a disadaptative stress would have deleterious effects on the hippocampus. Indeed, the hippocampus plays a part in a number of functions affected by dementia such as memory, learning process and emotional adjustment. This study takes into account stress factors ("stressors") but not factors influencing their impact on the subject such as an individual predisposition (genetic, psychopathologic, coping abilities) and social support. The force of the impact of these events on older people and what is really experienced by them remain unknown. This study strengthens a number of others evincing an unusual frequency of life events in dementia processes. According to an integrative pattern, repeated or prolonged stress could be a deciding factor in the degenerative process or a factor of decompensation with older people presenting a genetic, biological or psychological vulnerability to dementia. The impact of such life events would vary according to the subject's pre-morbid personality, coping abilities and the support he/she can rely on. CONCLUSION: Some life events may be involved in the dementia process as shown by the results of this study, but this relationship does not imply direct causality. It's difficult to appreciate whether these results are not a consequence of the greater attention paid to the patient after the appearance of the first symptoms, leading to a closer observation. Stress could trigger the degenerative process. This argues for the necessity of an early diagnosis taking into account a traumatic event of life either precocious or late...|$|E
