5|$|Although {{the eyes}} of most microbat species are small and poorly developed, leading to poor visual acuity, no species is blind. Microbats have mesopic vision, meaning that they can only detect light in low levels, whereas other mammals have <b>photopic</b> vision, which allows colour vision. Microbats may use their vision for {{orientation}} and while they are travelling between their roosting grounds and their feeding grounds, as echolocation is only effective over short distances. Some species can detect ultraviolet (UV). As the bodies of some microbats have distinct coloration, {{they may be able}} to discriminate colours.|$|E
5|$|Vision is an {{important}} sensory system for most species of fish. Fish eyes {{are similar to those}} of terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals, but have a more spherical lens. Their retinas generally have both rods and cones (for scotopic and <b>photopic</b> vision), and most species have colour vision. Some fish can see ultraviolet and some can see polarized light. Amongst jawless fish, the lamprey has well-developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots. Fish vision shows adaptation to their visual environment, for example deep sea fishes have eyes suited to the dark environment.|$|E

25|$|Rods cannot {{distinguish}} colours, but {{are responsible}} for low-light (scotopic) monochrome (black-and-white) vision; they work well in dim light as they contain a pigment, rhodopsin (visual purple), which is sensitive at low light intensity, but saturates at higher (<b>photopic)</b> intensities. Rods are distributed throughout the retina but there are none at the fovea and none at the blind spot. Rod density is greater in the peripheral retina than in the central retina.|$|E
25|$|The hemeralopic {{aspect of}} ACHM can be {{diagnosed}} non-invasively using electroretinography. The response at low (scotopic) and median (mesotopic) light levels will be normal but the response under high light level (<b>photopic)</b> conditions will be absent. The mesotopic level is approximately 100 times {{lower than the}} clinical level used for the typical high level electroretinogram. When as described, the condition {{is due to a}} saturation in the neural portion of the retina and not due to the absence of the photoreceptors per se.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, cone {{cells are}} less {{sensitive}} to the overall intensity of light, but come in three varieties that are sensitive to different frequency-ranges and thus {{are used in the}} perception of colour and <b>photopic</b> vision. Cone cells are highly concentrated in the fovea and have a high visual acuity meaning that they are better at spatial resolution than rod cells. Since cone cells are not as sensitive to dim light as rod cells, most night vision is limited to rod cells. Likewise, since cone cells are in the fovea, central vision (including the vision needed to do most reading, fine detail work such as sewing, or careful examination of objects) is done by cone cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{integrals}} of the XYZ {{color matching}} functions must all be equal by requirement 3 above, {{and this is}} set by the integral of the <b>photopic</b> luminous efficiency function by requirement 2 above. The tabulated sensitivity curves have {{a certain amount of}} arbitrariness in them. The shapes of the individual X, Y and Z sensitivity curves can be measured with a reasonable accuracy. However, the overall luminosity curve (which in fact is a weighted sum of these three curves) is subjective, since it involves asking a test person whether two light sources have the same brightness, even if they are in completely different colors. Along the same lines, the relative magnitudes of the X, Y, and Z curves are arbitrary. Furthermore, one could define a valid color space with an X sensitivity curve that has twice the amplitude. This new color space would have a different shape. The sensitivity curves in the CIE 1931 and 1964 XYZ color spaces are scaled to have equal areas under the curves.|$|E
500|$|In optics, the {{perception}} of green is evoked by light having a spectrum dominated by energy with a wavelength of roughly 495570nm. [...] The sensitivity of the dark-adapted human eye is greatest at about 507nm, a blue-green color, while the light-adapted eye is most sensitive about 555nm, a yellow-green; these are the peak locations of the rod and cone (scotopic and <b>photopic,</b> respectively) luminosity functions.|$|E

The luminance function describes the variation of perceived brightness with wavelength. The fact that the luminance function could be constructed by a linear combination of the RGB {{color matching}} functions was not guaranteed by any means but {{might be expected to}} be nearly true due to the near-linear nature of human sight.

2500|$|Photoreception is phylogenetically very old, {{with various}} {{theories}} of phylogenesis. The common origin (monophyly) of all animal eyes is now widely accepted as fact. This {{is based upon}} the shared genetic features of all eyes; that is, all modern eyes, varied as they are, have their origins in a proto-eye believed to have evolved some 540 million years ago, and the PAX6 gene is considered a key factor in this. The majority of the advancements in early eyes are believed to have taken only a few million years to develop, since the first predator to gain true imaging would have touched off an [...] "arms race" [...] among all species that did not flee the <b>photopic</b> environment. Prey animals and competing predators alike would be at a distinct disadvantage without such capabilities and {{would be less likely to}} survive and reproduce. Hence multiple eye types and subtypes developed in parallel (except those of groups, such as the vertebrates, that were only forced into the <b>photopic</b> environment at a late stage).|$|E
2500|$|Daylight vision (i.e. <b>photopic</b> vision) is subserved by cone {{receptor}} cells {{which have}} high spatial density (in the central fovea) and allow high acuity of 6/6 or better. In low light (i.e., scotopic) vision, cones {{do not have}} sufficient sensitivity and vision is subserved by rods. Spatial resolution is then much lower. This is due to spatial summation of rods, i.e. a number of rods merge into a bipolar cell, in turn connecting to a ganglion cell, and the resulting unit for resolution is large, and acuity small. Note {{that there are no}} rods in {{the very center of the}} visual field (the foveola), and highest performance in low light is achieved in near peripheral vision ...|$|E
2500|$|Outdoor performance:As an emissive display technology, OLEDs rely {{completely}} upon converting {{electricity to}} light, unlike most LCDs which are {{to some extent}} reflective. e-paper leads the way in efficiency with ~ 33% ambient light reflectivity, enabling the display to be used without any internal light source. The metallic cathode in an OLED acts as a mirror, with reflectance approaching 80%, leading to poor readability in bright ambient light such as outdoors. However, with the proper application of a circular polarizer and antireflective coatings, the diffuse reflectance {{can be reduced to}} less than 0.1%. [...] With 10,000 fc incident illumination (typical test condition for simulating outdoor illumination), that yields an approximate <b>photopic</b> contrast of 5:1. Recent advances in OLED technologies, however, enable OLEDs to become actually better than LCDs in bright sunlight. The Super AMOLED display in the Galaxy S5, for example, was found to outperform all LCD displays on the market in terms of brightness and reflectance.|$|E
