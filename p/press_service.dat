In January 1951, McBride testified in nationally televised hearings before the Kefauver Committee, where he was questioned about his Continental <b>Press</b> <b>Service</b> and alleged ties to organized crime and illegal gambling. It emerged that McBride partnered with Cleveland police captain John Fleming in real estate deals and had Fleming on the Yellow Cab payroll until 1941. McBride denied the mafia connections, claimed he never broke the law and was never charged with any crime. Congress later passed legislation making such wire services illegal.|$|E

Among these have been feature stories by the Multi-National Force: Iraq public affairs office, on married soldiers who deploy together. The Army Logistician, an Army publication for soldiers serving in support units, published a feature story on the stories of soldiers serving in Iraq for their September–October 2007 issue.

25|$|There are differing {{estimates}} of the total capital held by Iranian expatriates. One estimate places the number at $1.3 trillion US dollars. Whatever the actual number, {{it is clear that}} these funds are sufficiently large enough to buy significant stakes in all state companies. In Dubai alone, Iranian expatriates are estimated to have invested up to $200 billion. Even a 10 percent repatriation of capital would have a significant impact. In 2000, the Iran <b>Press</b> <b>Service</b> reported that Iranian expatriates had invested between $200 and $400 billion in the United States, Europe, and China, but almost nothing in Iran. FIPPA provisions apply to all foreign investors, and many Iranian expatriates based in the US continue to make substantial investments in Iran.|$|E
25|$|On March 15, 2015, a fire engulfed the convent's tallest bell tower, which pinnacles at {{height of}} 72 meters. The monastery had been {{undergoing}} major repair work and {{was covered in}} scaffolding. It took firefighters almost three hours {{to put out the}} fire. The blaze reportedly affected an area of three hundred square metres, but it was restricted to the scaffolding and didn't do any damage to the historical building itself. The speculated cause of the fire was a short circuit caused by heat guns used for drying the facade. The <b>press</b> <b>service</b> for the Moscow cultural heritage department has blamed the fire on the firm doing the restoration work. However, Russian Deputy Culture Minister Grigory Pirumov said that heat guns were not in use on the territory of the convent and the bell tower had been disconnected from the mains power supply.|$|E
