25|$|People have asked, so {{what are}} the demands? What are the demands all of these <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>making?</b> Either they say there are no demands and that leaves your critics confused, or they say that the demands for social {{equality}} and economic justice are impossible demands. And the impossible demands, they say, are just not practical. If hope is an impossible demand, then we demand the impossible – that the right to shelter, food and employment are impossible demands, then we demand the impossible. If it is impossible to demand that those who profit from the recession redistribute their wealth and cease their greed, then yes, we demand the impossible.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode a B– grade. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it a 6 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, {{this is not}} nearly as bad an episode as many <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> it out to be, but it’s not exactly a sterling piece of work, either. It feels like they were shooting for a 'Momento Mori' , and wound up with a 'Zero Sum'. This episode is interesting in the information it provides, and not much else. But in my opinion, it’s better than 'Lord of the Flies'." ...|$|E
500|$|Ideas {{alluding}} to romance are prevalent throughout the episode. The development between Shane Walsh and Lori Grimes continues in [...] "TS-19", which showcases a flashback featuring Shane being conflicted {{with the decision}} to leave an unconscious Rick Grimes in the hospital—who Shane initially presumes to be dead. Kirkman asserted that the sequence added dimension to the storyline, and concluded that by {{the ending of the}} episode, the audience will no longer identify Shane as an antagonist. [...] "Up until the sixth episode, you get the sense that Shane actually is a bad guy, that he lied to Lori and made her believe that he was dead in order to facilitate him moving in on her," [...] said Kirkman. [...] "The flashback does a great job of telling you that that's not true: He tried to save Rick, he wanted to save Rick. He was kind of up against the wall there and actually did believe that Rick was dead." [...] Lincoln said of the flashback: [...] "You realize Shane's loyalty as a friend and as a man—and also his weaknesses. He still can't make a decision without his partner, and you realize he's flawed—everybody is under incredible duress, you see the state of the world is so extreme and terrifying that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> split-second decisions under great duress. Is Shane barricading Rick in, or is he trying to prevent him being taken by the walkers? There are many different ways to construe what Shane has done and that's the beauty of the show is that there's no clear and definite answers, you make your own mind." [...] Other themes prominent in the episode include suicide and terror.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{influence}} on bicycle culture from Copenhagen is the [...] Cycle chic movement. It grew from reactions to {{a photo of}} a girl wearing her regular clothes on a bike, which inspired the photographer, Michael Colville-Andersen, to start the blog Copenhagen Cycle Chic featuring mainly female subjects riding their bikes in fashionable everyday clothes. Its popularity have spawned a global movement with over 100 Cycle Chic blogs featuring similarly themed photography from other cities and areas around the world. Bloggers around the world are trying very hard to get featured on the Cycle Chic blog because they think it's cool. So now many <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> their own blogs that feature cyclists around the world. Most of them are associated with the original blog, the Copenhagen Cycle Chic.|$|E

He said, [...] "It would be nice not to have to loan or contribute to your own campaign... If other <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> sacrifices, I sure have to as well.

50|$|In {{collaboration}} with Greg Mitchell and Linda Skitka, Tetlock has conducted research on hypothetical societies and intuitions about justice “experimental political philosophy”). The spotlight here is on a fundamental question in political theory: who should get what from whom, when, how, and why? In real-world debates over distributive justice, however, Tetlock argues {{it is virtually}} impossible to disentangle the factual assumptions that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> about human beings from the value judgments <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> about end-state goals, such as equality and efficiency. Hypothetical society studies make it possible for social scientists to disentangle these otherwise hopelessly confounded influences on public policy preferences.|$|E
