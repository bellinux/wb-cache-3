40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of nanoindentation experiments on Cu single crystals and Cu grains in through silicon via (TSV) structures used for 3 D integrated circuit (IC) stacking, at sub- 10 nm and several- 10 nm <b>penetration</b> <b>depths.</b> The reduced moduli for Cu single crystals change from an average value to the uni-directional values, as the <b>penetration</b> <b>depths</b> decrease from several- 10 nm to sub- 10 nm. At sub- 10 nm deformation, about one third of the indentations on Cu(111) and Cu(110) show fully elastic behavior, while all indentations on Cu(100) shows elastic-plastic behavior. The reduced modulus values extracted from indents on Cu(111) and Cu(110) with fully elastic behavior are about 195 GPa and 145 GPa, respectively. For <b>penetration</b> <b>depths</b> of several- 10 nm up to 50 nm, the reduced modulus for Cu(100) varies between 50 GPa to 100 GPa. The averaged reduced moduli determined at relatively large <b>penetration</b> <b>depths</b> are explained with lattice rotation beneath the indentations. Sinc e the activation of multiple slip systems is required for lattice rotation, the transition of the unidirectional reduced modulus to the averaged value with increasing <b>penetration</b> <b>depths</b> occurs differently for Cu(111) and Cu(100). Similar to the results from Cu single crystals, unidirectional reduced moduli are obtained for the Cu grains in TSV structures at sub- 10 nm <b>penetration</b> <b>depths...</b>|$|R

25|$|Similarly, {{at a fixed}} {{temperature}} {{below the}} critical temperature, superconducting materials cease to superconduct when an external magnetic field is applied which {{is greater than the}} critical magnetic field. This is because the Gibbs free energy of the superconducting phase increases quadratically with the magnetic field while the free energy of the normal phase is roughly independent of the magnetic field. If the material superconducts {{in the absence of a}} field, then the superconducting phase free energy is lower than that of the normal phase and so for some finite value of the magnetic field (proportional to the square root of the difference of the free energies at zero magnetic field) the two free energies will be equal and a phase transition to the normal phase will occur. More generally, a higher temperature and a stronger magnetic field lead to a smaller fraction of the electrons in the superconducting band and consequently a longer London <b>penetration</b> <b>depth</b> of external magnetic fields and currents. The <b>penetration</b> <b>depth</b> becomes infinite at the phase transition.|$|E
