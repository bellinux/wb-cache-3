30|$|System {{stability}} is normally associated with power system faults in a network, such as tripping of transmission lines, loss of <b>production</b> <b>capacity</b> (generator <b>unit</b> failure) and short circuits. These failures disrupt {{the balance of}} power (active and reactive) and change the power flow. Though the capacity of the operating generators may be adequate, large voltage drops may occur suddenly. The unbalance and re-distribution of active and reactive power in the network may force the system variables to vary beyond the boundary of stability. A period of low voltage (brownout) may occur and possibly be followed by a complete loss of power (blackout).|$|R

40|$|Microencapsulation {{supplies}} {{cells with}} a three-dimensional microenvironment enhancing the metabolic activity, cell density and recombinant protein expression in a stirred tank bioreactor {{which is used}} widely to culture mammalian cells in many biochemical processes. In this paper, we address the growth and Desmodus rotundus salivary plasminogen activator (DSPA) production of recombinant CHO (rCHO) in a stirred tank bioreactor. Cells were cultured using two different methods-in an unmicroencapsulated versus microencapsulated culture-and compared differences between {{them in terms of}} cell reproduction and DSPA protein productivity. Compared to the unmicroencapsulated rCHO, microencapsulated cells got higher cell density and prolonged the plateau phase. Microencapsulated rCHO promoted DSPA production, with a maximum rate that was 4. 8 times higher than in unmicroencapsulated cells, and the accumulated production of DSPA was 3. 3 higher than in unmicroencapsulated cells. Negative relationship was found between specific growth rate and DSPA <b>production</b> <b>capacity</b> of <b>unit</b> cells. These findings will facilitate the methods for higher DSPA production in stirred tank bioreactors...|$|R
