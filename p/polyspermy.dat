25|$|Upon penetration, the oocyte {{is said to}} {{have become}} activated. It {{undergoes}} its secondary meiotic division, and the two haploid nuclei (paternal and maternal) fuse to form a zygote. In order to prevent <b>polyspermy</b> and minimise the possibility of producing a triploid zygote, several changes to the egg's zona pellucida renders them impenetrable shortly after the first sperm enters the egg.|$|E
25|$|Polyploidy {{occurs in}} humans {{in the form}} of triploidy, with 69 {{chromosomes}} (sometimes called 69,XXX), and tetraploidy with 92 chromosomes (sometimes called 92,XXXX). Triploidy, usually due to <b>polyspermy,</b> occurs in about 2–3% of all human pregnancies and ~15% of miscarriages. The vast majority of triploid conceptions end as a miscarriage; those that do survive to term typically die shortly after birth. In some cases, survival past birth may extend longer if there is mixoploidy with both a diploid and a triploid cell population present.|$|E
5000|$|Electrical <b>polyspermy</b> blocks {{operate in}} many animal species, {{including}} frogs, clams, and marine worms, {{but not in}} the several mammals that have been studied (hamster, rabbit, mouse). [...] In species without an electrical block, <b>polyspermy</b> is usually prevented by secretion of materials that establish a mechanical barrier to <b>polyspermy.</b> Animals such as sea urchins have a two-step <b>polyspermy</b> prevention strategy, with the fast, but transient, electrical block superseded after the first minute or so by a more slowly developing permanent mechanical block. It is thought that electrical blocks evolved in those species where a very fast block to <b>polyspermy</b> is needed, due to the presence of many sperm arriving simultaneously at the egg surface, as occurs in animals such as sea urchins. In sea urchins, fertilization occurs externally in the ocean, such that hundreds of sperm can encounter the egg within several seconds.|$|E
50|$|The {{cortical}} {{reaction is}} a process initiated during fertilization by the release of cortical granules from the egg, which prevents <b>polyspermy,</b> the fusion of multiple sperm with one egg. In contrast to the fast block of <b>polyspermy</b> which immediately but temporarily blocks additional sperm from fertilizing the egg, the cortical reaction gradually establishes a permanent barrier to sperm entry and functions as {{the main part of}} the slow block of <b>polyspermy</b> in many animals.|$|E

50|$|Hyalin has a {{secondary}} effect of aiding with <b>polyspermy</b> {{when in the}} hyaline layer. The fertilization envelope is the hardened mechanical barrier that blocks additional sperm from penetrating the cell. It is created by the products secreted by the cortical granules. Underneath the fertilization envelope is the hyaline layer, which covers up sperm receptors in the egg's plasma membrane. Should the fertilization envelope not form or dissociate, the hyaline layer alone blocks against <b>polyspermy.</b>|$|E
50|$|Calreticulin: Evidence has {{indicated}} {{the presence of}} the protein, calreticulin, within the cortical granule. Researchers have suggested that calreticulin serves as a chaperone protein for other cortical granule components contributing to <b>polyspermy</b> prevention. Additionally contributing to <b>polyspermy</b> prevention, calreticulin may also inhibit certain glycoproteins, which promote interaction between the oocyte and sperm. On the other hand, different research has shown that calreticulin may be released from vesicles other than cortical granules. Furthermore, upon exocytosis, this calreticulin interacts with the oocyte's cytoskeleton, thereby allowing the transmission of transmembrane signaling for the continuance of the cell's cycle.|$|E
50|$|N-Acetylglucosaminidase: Experimentally {{found within}} mouse {{cortical}} granules, N-Acetylglucosaminidase is a glycosidase that hydrolyzes N-acetylglucosamine residues {{located on the}} zona pellucida. N-acetylglucosamines on the zona pellucida normally promote sperm binding. Therefore, N-Acetylglucosaminidase contributes to <b>polyspermy</b> prevention.|$|E
50|$|In biology, <b>polyspermy</b> {{describes}} an egg {{that has been}} fertilized {{by more than one}} sperm. Diploid organisms normally contain two copies of each chromosome, one from each parent. The cell resulting from <b>polyspermy,</b> on the other hand, contains three or more copies of each chromosome—one from the egg and one each from multiple sperm. Usually, the result is an inviable zygote. This may occur because sperm are too efficient at reaching and fertilizing eggs due to the selective pressures of sperm competition. Such a situation is often deleterious to the female: in other words, the male-male competition among sperm spills over to create sexual conflict.|$|E
5000|$|The {{prevention}} of <b>polyspermy</b> in sea urchins {{depends on a}} change in the electrical charge {{across the surface of the}} egg, which is caused by the fusion of the first sperm with the egg. Unfertilized sea urchin eggs have a negative charge inside, but the charge becomes positive upon fertilization. When sea urchin sperm encounter an egg with a positive charge, sperm-egg fusion is blocked. Thus, after the first sperm contacts the egg and causes the change, subsequent sperms are prevented from fusing. This [...] "electrical <b>polyspermy</b> block" [...] is thought to result because a positively charged molecule in the sperm surface membrane is repelled by the positive charge at the egg surface.|$|E
50|$|Hyalin is a large, acidic protein which aids in {{embryonic}} development. The protein {{has strong}} adhesive properties {{which can help}} with cell differentiation and as a <b>polyspermy</b> prevention component. It forms the hyaline layer which covers {{the surface of the}} egg after insemination.|$|E
50|$|Hyalin is {{a protein}} {{released}} from the cortical granules of a fertilized animal egg. The released hyalin modifies the extracellular matrix of the fertilized egg to block other sperm from binding to the egg, and {{is known as the}} slow-block to <b>polyspermy.</b> All animals have this slow-block mechanism.|$|E
50|$|The slow {{block to}} <b>polyspermy</b> {{in the sea}} urchin is {{mediated}} by the PIP2 secondary messenger system. Activation of the binding receptors activates PLC, which cleaves PIP2 in the egg plasma membrane, releasing IP3 into the egg cell cytoplasm. IP3 diffuses to the ER, where it opens Ca2+ channels.|$|E
5000|$|... p32: The name, p32, {{refers to}} the protein's {{molecular}} weight, 32 kDa. Upon release from the cortical granule, p32 appears to either function briefly or undergo a modification shortly after fertilization because only small amounts of p32 are present on the embryo. Research also suggests that p32 does not contribute to <b>polyspermy</b> prevention.|$|E
50|$|<b>Polyspermy</b> is the {{condition}} when multiple sperm fuse {{with a single}} egg. This results in duplications of genetic material. In sea urchins, the block to <b>polyspermy</b> comes from two mechanisms: the fast block and the slow block. The fast block is an electrical block to <b>polyspermy.</b> The resting potential of an egg is -70mV. After contact with sperm, an influx of sodium ions increases the potential up to +20mV. The slow block is through a biochemical mechanism triggered by a wave of calcium increase. The rise of calcium is both necessary and sufficient to trigger the slow block. In the cortical reaction, cortical granules directly beneath the plasma membrane are released into {{the space between the}} plasma membrane and the vitelline membrane (the perivitelline space). An increase in calcium triggers this release. The contents of the granules contain proteases, mucopolysaccharides, hyalin, and peroxidases. The proteases cleave the bridges connecting the plasma membrane and the vitelline membrane and cleave the bindin to release the sperm. The mucopolysaccharides attract water to raise the vitelline membrane. The hyalin forms a layer adjacent to the plasma membrane and the peroxidases cross-link the protein in the vitelline membrane to harden it and make it impenetrable to sperm. Through these molecules the vitelline membrane is transformed into the fertilization membrane or fertilization envelope. In mice, the zona reaction is the equivalent to the cortical reaction in sea urchins. The terminal sugars from ZP3 are cleaved to release the sperm and prevent new binding.|$|E
50|$|Upon penetration, the oocyte {{is said to}} {{have become}} activated. It {{undergoes}} its secondary meiotic division, and the two haploid nuclei (paternal and maternal) fuse to form a zygote. In order to prevent <b>polyspermy</b> and minimise the possibility of producing a triploid zygote, several changes to the egg's zona pellucida renders them impenetrable shortly after the first sperm enters the egg.|$|E
50|$|Female {{defenses}} select {{for ever}} more aggressive male sperm however, {{leading to an}} evolutionary arms race. On the one hand, <b>polyspermy</b> creates inviable zygotes and lowers female fitness, but on the other, defenses may prevent fertilization altogether. This leads to a delicate compromise between the two, and has been suggested as one possible cause for the relatively high infertility rates seen in mammalian species.|$|E
50|$|As {{soon as the}} {{spermatozoon}} fuses {{with the}} ovum, signal transduction occurs, resulting in an increase of cytoplasmic calcium ions. This itself triggers the cortical reaction, which results in depositing several substances onto the vitelline membrane through exocytosis of the cortical granules, transforming it into a hard layer called the “fertilization membrane”, {{which serves as a}} barrier inaccessible to other spermatozoa. This phenomenon is the slow block to <b>polyspermy.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many other {{functions}} for the egg jelly {{have been proposed}} including sperm agglomeration, protection from mechanical stress and <b>polyspermy,</b> and increasing {{the size of the}} egg to improve its chances of colliding with sperm. In addition to the sea urchin, egg jelly appears in many species including invertebrates and mammals, and can vary in composition and complexity from the relatively homogenous single layer sea urchin egg to the three layer egg jelly in starfish.|$|E
5000|$|The perivitelline {{space is}} {{the space between}} the zona pellucida and the cell {{membrane}} of an oocyte or fertilized ovum. [...] In the slow block to <b>polyspermy,</b> the cortical granules released from the ovum are deposited in the perivitelline space. Polysaccharides released in the granules cause the space to swell, pushing the zona pellucida farther from the oocyte. [...] The hydrolytic enzymes released by the granules cause the zona reaction, which removes the ZP3 ligands from the zona pellucida.|$|E
50|$|After {{the initial}} {{fertilisation}} stage, a sudden decrease of Juno from the egg cell surface occurs and Juno becomes virtually undetectable after just 40 minutes. Still, after fertilization via intracytoplasmic sperm injection, the egg cell does not lose cell-surface expression of Juno, {{which suggests that}} Juno contributes to the prevention of <b>polyspermy.</b> Mice lacking Juno {{on the surface of}} their egg cells are infertile because their egg cells do not fuse with normal sperm, demonstrating Juno's essential role in the fertility of female mice.|$|E
50|$|Polyploidy {{occurs in}} humans {{in the form}} of triploidy, with 69 {{chromosomes}} (sometimes called 69,XXX), and tetraploidy with 92 chromosomes (sometimes called 92,XXXX). Triploidy, usually due to <b>polyspermy,</b> occurs in about 2-3% of all human pregnancies and ~15% of miscarriages. The vast majority of triploid conceptions end as a miscarriage; those that do survive to term typically die shortly after birth. In some cases, survival past birth may extend longer if there is mixoploidy with both a diploid and a triploid cell population present.|$|E
50|$|Upon penetration, if all is {{occurring}} normally, {{the process of}} egg-activation occurs and the oocyte {{is said to have}} become activated. This is thought to be induced by a specific protein phospholipase c zeta. It undergoes its secondary meiotic division, and the two haploid nuclei (paternal and maternal) fuse to form a zygote. In order to prevent <b>polyspermy</b> and minimise the possibility of producing a triploid zygote, several changes to the egg's cell membranes renders them impenetrable shortly after the first sperm enters the egg.|$|E
50|$|Cortical {{granules}} are regulatory secretory organelles (ranging from 0.2 um to 0.6 um in diameter) {{found within}} oocytes and are most associated with <b>polyspermy</b> prevention {{after the event}} of fertilization. Cortical granules are found among all mammals, many vertebrates, and some invertebrates. Within the oocyte, cortical granules are located along the cortex, the region furthest from the cell's center. Following fertilization, a signaling pathway induces the cortical granules to fuse with the oocyte's cell membrane and release their contents into the oocyte's extracellular matrix. This exocytosis of cortical granules {{is known as the}} cortical reaction. In mammals, the oocyte's extracellular matrix includes a surrounding layer of perivitelline space, zona pellucida, and finally cumulus cells. Experimental evidence has demonstrated that the released contents of the cortical granules modify the oocyte's extracellular matrix, particularly the zona pellucida. This alteration of the zona pellucida components is known as the zona reaction. The cortical reaction does not occur in all mammals, suggesting the likelihood of other functional purposes for cortical granules. In addition to modifying the oocyte's extracellular matrix and establishing a block to <b>polyspermy,</b> the exocytosis of cortical granules may also contribute towards protection and support of the developing embryo during preimplantation. Once the cortical granules complete their functions, the oocyte does not replenish them.|$|E
50|$|According to the Babylonian Talmud (Sotah 42b) Goliath was {{a son of}} Orpah, the {{sister-in-law}} of Ruth, David's own great grandmother (Ruth → Obed → Jesse → David). Ruth Rabbah, a haggadic and homiletic {{interpretation of}} the Book of Ruth, makes the blood-relationship even closer, considering Orpah and Ruth to have been full sisters. Orpah {{was said to have}} made a pretense of accompanying Ruth but after forty paces left her. Thereafter she led a dissolute life. According to the Jerusalem Talmud Goliath was born by <b>polyspermy,</b> and had about one hundred fathers.|$|E
50|$|Assisted {{reproductive}} technologies help {{to treat}} infertility and genetically improve livestock. However, {{the efficiency of}} these technologies in cryopreservation and the in vitro production of mammalian embryos is low. Microfluidics have been applied in these technologies to better mimic the in vivo microenvironment with patterned topographic and biochemical surfaces for controlled spatiotemporal cell adhesion, as well as minimization of dead volumes. Micropumps and microvalves can automate tedious fluid-dispensing procedures and various sensors can be integrated for real-time quality control. Bio-MEMS devices {{have been developed to}} evaluate sperm motility, perform sperm selection, as well as prevent <b>polyspermy</b> in in-vitro fertilization.|$|E
50|$|The sperm-binding domain on the ZP2 {{protein is}} {{necessary}} in both humans and mice for oocyte-sperm recognition and penetration of the zona pellucida. It is also responsible for the primary block to <b>polyspermy</b> in mammals. The oocyte has cortical granules peripherally located under the cortex that contain a proteolytic protein called ovastacin. After the sperm binds to ZP2, the cortical granules are exocytosed releasing ovastacin into the perivitelline space. Ovastacin cleaves ZP2 at the N terminus, preventing more sperm from binding and penetrating the oocyte, thus hardening the zona pellucida. Ovastacin is only found in oocytes, and {{is part of the}} astacin family of metalloendoproteases. Female mice engineered without ovastacin showed that ZP2 was not cleaved after fertilization.|$|E
5000|$|In mammals, {{in which}} {{fertilization}} occurs internally, fewer sperm reach the fertilization {{site in the}} oviduct. This {{may be the result}} of the female genital tract being adapted to minimize the number of sperm reaching the egg. Nevertheless, <b>polyspermy</b> preventing mechanisms are essential in mammals; a secretion reaction, the [...] "cortical reaction" [...] modifies the extracellular coat of the egg (the zona pellucida), and additional mechanisms that are not well understood modify the egg's plasma membrane. The zona pellucida is modified by serine proteases that are released from the cortical granules. The proteases destroy the protein link between the cell membrane and the vitelline envelope, remove any receptors that other sperm have bound to, and help to form the fertilization envelope from the cortical granules.|$|E
50|$|Proteinases: The proteinases {{present in}} {{mammalian}} cortical granules primarily serve {{to modify the}} zona pelucida during the zona reaction. Some associated cortical granule proteinases are the trypsin-like proteinase, ZP2 proteinase, and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). Both the ZP2 proteinase and trypsin-like proteinase contribute to <b>polyspermy</b> prevention. As its name suggests, ZP2 proteinase proteolyzes ZP2 during the zona reaction. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is a serine proteinase that transforms plasminogen into its activated form, plasmin. Tissue-type plasminogen's presence has been recorded during the cortical reaction. Despite this association with the cortical reaction, however, evidence {{has yet to be}} found supporting that the tissue-type plasminogen activator is a cortical granule component. Furthermore, mRNA coding for tissue-type plasminogen activator is not translated until after most cortical granules have formed within the oocyte.|$|E
50|$|Sea squirt {{eggs are}} {{surrounded}} by a fibrous vitelline coat and a layer of follicle cells that produce sperm-attracting substances. In fertilization, the sperm passes through the follicle cells and binds to glycosides on the vitelline coat. The sperm's mitochondria are left behind as the sperm enters and drives through the coat; this translocation of the mitochondria might provide the necessary force for penetration. The sperm swims through the perivitelline space, finally reaching the egg plasma membrane and entering the egg. This prompts rapid modification of the vitelline coat, through processes such as the egg's release of glycosidase into the seawater, so no more sperm can bind and <b>polyspermy</b> is avoided. After fertilization, free calcium ions are released in the egg cytoplasm in waves, mostly from internal stores. The temporary large increase in calcium concentration prompts the physiological and structural changes of development.|$|E
50|$|The sugar {{residues}} in the tetrasaccaride and the {{fatty acid}} residues in the phosphatidylinositol group {{vary depending on}} the protein. This great diversity is what allows the GPI proteins to have a wide range of functions including acting as hydrolytic enzymes, adhesion molecule, receptors, protease inhibitor and complement regulatory proteins. Furthermore, GPI proteins play an important in embryogenesis, development, neurogenesis, the immune system and fertilization. More specifically, the GPI protein IZUMO1R/JUNO (named after the Roman goddess of fertility) on the egg plasma has an essential role in sperm-egg fusion. Releasing the IZUMO1R/JUNO GPI protein from the egg plasma membrane does not allow for sperm to fuse with the egg and it is suggested that this mechanism may contribute to the <b>polyspermy</b> block at the plasma membrane in eggs. Other roles that GPI modification allows for is in the association with membrane microdomains, transient homodimerization or in apical sorting in polarized cells.|$|E
50|$|Successful {{fertilization}} {{is enabled}} by three processes, which also act as controls to ensure species-specificity. The {{first is that}} of chemotaxis which directs {{the movement of the}} sperm towards the ovum. Secondly there is an adhesive compatibility between the sperm and the egg. With the sperm adhered to the ovum, the third process of acrosomal reaction takes place; the front part of the spermatozoon head is capped by an acrosome which contains digestive enzymes to break down the zona pellucida and allow its entry. The entry of the sperm causes calcium to be released which blocks entry to other sperm cells. A parallel reaction takes place in the ovum called the zona reaction. This sees the release of cortical granules that release enzymes which digest sperm receptor proteins, thus preventing <b>polyspermy.</b> The granules also fuse with the plasma membrane and modify the zona pellucida {{in such a way as}} to prevent further sperm entry.|$|E
50|$|The oocyte is {{the female}} cell {{involved}} in reproduction. There {{is a close}} relationship between the oocyte and the surrounding follicular cells which {{is crucial to the}} development of both. GDF9 and BMP15 produced by the oocyte bind to BMPR2 receptors on follicular cells activating SMADs 2/3, ensuring follicular development. Concomitantly, oocyte growth is initiated by binding of KITL to its receptor KIT in the oocyte, leading to the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway, allowing oocyte survival and development. During embryogenesis, oocytes initiate meiosis and stop in prophase I. This arrest is maintained by elevated levels of cAMP within the oocyte. It was recently suggested that cGMP cooperates with cAMP to maintain the cell cycle arrest. During meitotic maturation, the LH peak that precedes ovulation activates MAPK pathway leading to gap junction disruption and breakdown of communication between the oocyte and the follicular cells. PDE3A is activated and degrades cAMP, leading to cell cycle progression and oocyte maturation. The LH surge also leads to the production of progesterone and prostaglandins that induce the expression of ADAMTS1 and other proteases, as well as their inhibitors. This will lead to degradation of the follicular wall, but limiting the damage and ensuring that the rupture occurs in the appropriate location, releasing the oocyte into the Fallopian tubes. Oocyte activation depends on fertilization by sperm. It is initiated with sperm's attraction induced by prostaglandins produced by the oocyte, which will create a gradient that will influence the sperm's direction and velocity. After fusion with the oocyte, PLC ζ of the spermatozoa is released into the oocyte leading to an increase in Ca2+ levels that will activate CaMKII which will degrade MPF, leading to the resumption of meiosis. The increased Ca2+ levels will induce the exocytosis of cortical granules that degrade ZP receptors, used by sperm to penetrate the oocyte, blocking <b>polyspermy.</b> Deregulation of these pathways will lead to several diseases like, oocyte maturation failure syndrome which results in infertility. Increasing our molecular knowledge of oocyte development mechanisms could improve the outcome of assisted reproduction procedures, facilitating conception.|$|E
40|$|For free‐spawning {{organisms that}} release gametes into the sea, sperm {{limitation}} (too few sperm to fertilize all eggs) {{is a major}} factor limiting reproductive success. Given such circumstances, the presence of several mechanisms to prevent <b>polyspermy</b> (too many sperm) may seem paradoxical; however, a growing body of data suggests that natural fertilization levels, though variable, can routinely be high. Under such conditions, <b>polyspermy</b> is much more likely. The tension between sperm limitation and <b>polyspermy</b> represents sexual conflict because males, in competing to fertilize as many eggs as possible, can impose lethal costs on eggs if multiple sperm gain entry. Here we present data for a marine invertebrate indicating high levels of <b>polyspermy</b> under sperm‐limited conditions. When the sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus was induced to spawn in situ, mean rates of <b>polyspermy</b> were 17. 3 % ± 3. 4 %, and <b>polyspermy</b> was recorded at rates as high as 62. 7 %. <b>Polyspermy</b> was nearly always present, even when fertilization rates were < 50 %, confirming predictions that it should be present under sperm‐limited conditions. Both sperm limitation and <b>polyspermy</b> imposed substantial reproductive costs, and we conclude that both sexual conflict related to <b>polyspermy</b> and sperm limitation have been simultaneous strong selective forces shaping the evolution of reproductive traits in the sea. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Developmental failure {{caused by}} excess sperm (<b>polyspermy)</b> {{is thought to}} be an {{important}} mechanism driving the evolution of gamete-recognition proteins, reproductive isolation, and speciation in marine organisms. However, these theories assume that there is heritable variation in the susceptibility to <b>polyspermy</b> and that this variation is related to the overall affinity between sperm and eggs. These assumptions have not been critically examined. We investigated the relationship between ease of fertilization and susceptibility to <b>polyspermy</b> within and among three congeneric sea urchins. The results from laboratory studies indicate that, both within and among species, individuals and species that produce eggs capable of fertilization at relatively low sperm concentrations are more susceptible to <b>polyspermy,</b> whereas individuals and species producing eggs that require higher concentrations of sperm to be fertilized are more resistant to <b>polyspermy.</b> This relationship sets the stage for selection on gamete traits that depend on sperm availability and for sexual conflict that can influence the evolution of gamete-recognition proteins and eventually lead to reproductive isolation.

40|$|<b>Polyspermy</b> is an {{important}} anomaly of fertilization in placental mammals, causing premature death of the embryo. It is especially frequent under in vitro conditions, complicating the successful generation of viable embryos. A block to <b>polyspermy</b> develops {{as a result of}} changes after sperm entry (i. e., cortical granule exocytosis). However, additional factors may play {{an important}} role in regulating <b>polyspermy</b> by acting on gametes before sperm–oocyte interaction. Most studies have used rodents as models, but ungulates may differ in mechanisms preventing <b>polyspermy.</b> We hypothesize that zona pellucida (ZP) changes during transit of the oocyte along the oviductal ampulla modulate the interaction with spermatozoa, contributing to the regulation of <b>polyspermy.</b> We report here that periovulatory oviductal fluid (OF) from sows and heifers increases (both, con- and heterospecifically) ZP resistance to digestion with pronase (a parameter commonly used to measure the block to <b>polyspermy),</b> changing from digestion times of ≈ 1 min (pig) or 2 min (cattle) to 45 min (pig) or several hours (cattle). Exposure of oocytes to OF increases monospermy after in vitro fertilization in both species, and in pigs, sperm–ZP binding decreases. The resistance of OF-exposed oocytes to pronase was abolished by exposure to heparin-depleted medium; in a medium with heparin it was not altered. Proteomic analysis of the content released in the heparin-depleted medium after removal of OF-exposed oocytes allowed the isolation and identification of oviduct-specific glycoprotein. Thus, an oviduct-specific glycoprotein–heparin protein complex seems to be responsible for ZP changes in the oviduct before fertilization, affecting sperm binding and contributing to the regulation of <b>polyspermy...</b>|$|E
