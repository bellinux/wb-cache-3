5|$|The {{boundary}} between gem-quality diamonds and industrial diamonds is poorly defined and partly depends on market conditions (for example, if demand for <b>polished</b> diamonds is high, some lower-grade stones will be <b>polished</b> into low-quality or small gemstones {{rather than being}} sold for industrial use).

5|$|Beryllium mirrors are of {{particular}} interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a honeycomb support structure, are used, for example, in meteorological satellites where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in optical guidance systems and in fire-control systems, e.g. in the German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard electroless nickel plating which can be more easily <b>polished</b> to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is <b>polished</b> without any coating. This is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.|$|E

30|$|Removal rate of <b>polishing,</b> which {{depicts the}} {{properties}} of part surface’s removal amount at a local <b>polishing</b> position during every unit of time, {{is an important part}} of study about <b>polishing</b> process [19],[20]. Many factors affect the <b>polishing</b> removal rate, such as <b>polishing</b> tool and <b>polishing</b> environment [21]-[23]. For the <b>polishing</b> tool, the main factors are material property, shape, and surface roughness. While for the <b>polishing</b> part, the results are relevant to material property and friction coefficient between the part and the <b>polishing</b> tool. Additionally, for the <b>polishing</b> environment, the main factors include the particle size and viscosity of <b>polishing</b> paste and <b>polishing</b> liquid, the temperature and pressure during <b>polishing</b> and the chemical correction of part in the <b>polishing</b> liquid.|$|R

30|$|Path {{planning}} {{is one of}} the key issues of the <b>polishing</b> process for freeform surface. Using the classical Preston <b>polishing</b> function, the mathematical model of small <b>polishing</b> tool is derived. With the assumption of a constant <b>polishing</b> pressure, the removal functions of scan line <b>polishing</b> path, Archimedean spiral <b>polishing</b> path, and Hilbert fractal <b>polishing</b> path are derived. The modeling method for <b>polishing</b> paths on a planar surface projected on a freeform surface is also discussed.|$|R
30|$|As {{different}} {{parameters for}} the same type <b>polishing</b> path may cause different <b>polishing</b> quality, the optimize parameters of <b>polishing</b> path are analyzed. The optimal <b>polishing</b> space for the scan line path and the Archimedean spiral <b>polishing</b> path is 1.9 R and 1.3 R, respectively. By comparing the removal functions of different <b>polishing</b> path, the reasonable <b>polishing</b> path and parameters are chosen. In order to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} selected Hilbert fractal <b>polishing</b> path, a <b>polishing</b> experiment is conducted on a self-developed mechanical <b>polishing</b> machine and the sequence of <b>polishing</b> process can be automatically scheduled. The results demonstrate that the roughness of freeform surface is improved from level 9 to level 11.|$|R

5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of the problem was that the primary mirror had been <b>polished</b> to the wrong shape. Although it was {{probably}} the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E

30|$|As the <b>polishing</b> {{surface is}} highly nondeterministic, {{one of the}} reasons is that the <b>polishing</b> path of the tool affects the removal considerably. A basic {{requirement}} for <b>polishing</b> paths is that the surface can be completely and uniformly covered during a <b>polishing</b> cycle. Therefore, the study of removal function of different <b>polishing</b> path has a very important significance. A lots of <b>polishing</b> paths in mechanical <b>polishing</b> process can be found in literatures [13]-[18]. The ultimate goal of the research about different <b>polishing</b> removal function is to select an optimal <b>polishing</b> path so as to avoid any under-polishing and over-polishing phenomenon and ensure the uniformity of the <b>polishing</b> process. Meanwhile, it can also present a clear understanding of the various factors that influence the <b>polishing</b> quality. The core issue of this research is to study the <b>polishing</b> removal function and the <b>polishing</b> performance in a given surface shape and a specified path, so that it can facilitate the subsequent <b>polishing</b> path control.|$|R
