40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of <b>preferred</b> <b>stock</b> on the credit ratings {{assessed}} by professional credit analysts. <b>Preferred</b> <b>stock</b> inherently contains both features of debt and equity financing. Hence, the nature of <b>preferred</b> <b>stock</b> has presented a puzzle {{to the efforts of}} accounting regulators such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board to consistently classify within the existing framework established by financial reporting standards. I find evidence that the association of <b>preferred</b> <b>stock</b> with credit analysts' assessments of credit risk depends on two factors. First, the association of <b>preferred</b> <b>stock</b> with credit ratings varies by the type of <b>preferred</b> <b>stock.</b> <b>Preferred</b> <b>stock</b> that is redeemable is negatively associated with credit ratings, while nonredeemable <b>preferred</b> <b>stock</b> bears no consistent association with credit ratings. Second, the negative association of redeemable <b>preferred</b> <b>stock</b> with credit ratings is sensitive to the firm's financial condition. For those firms in poor financial health, the negative association dissipates. This is in line with <b>preferred</b> <b>stock's</b> inability to drive an insolvent firm into bankruptcy...|$|R

2500|$|The term {{fixed income}} is also {{applied to a}} person's income that does not vary {{materially}} over time. This can include income derived from fixed-income investments such as bonds and <b>preferred</b> <b>stocks</b> or pensions that guarantee a fixed income.

2500|$|In the 2001 Enron {{accounting}} scandal, the company's ratings {{remained at}} investment grade until {{four days before}} bankruptcy—though Enron's stock had been in sharp decline for several months—when [...] "the outlines of its fraudulent practices" [...] were first revealed. Critics complained that [...] "not a single analyst at either Moody's of S lost {{his job as a}} result of missing the Enron fraud" [...] and [...] "management stayed the same". During the subprime crisis, when hundreds of billion of dollars' worth of triple-A-rated mortgage-backed securities were abruptly downgraded from triple-A to [...] "junk" [...] status within two years of issue, the CRAs' ratings were characterized by critics as [...] "catastrophically misleading" [...] and [...] "provided little or no value". Ratings of <b>preferred</b> <b>stocks</b> also fared poorly. Despite over a year of rising mortgage deliquencies, Moody's continued to rate Freddie Mac's preferred stock triple-A until mid-2008, when it was downgraded to one tick above the junk bond level. Some empirical studies have also found that rather than a downgrade lowering the market price and raising the interest rates of corporate bonds, the cause and effect are reversed. Expanding yield spreads (i.e., declining value and quality) of corporate bonds precedes downgrades by agencies, suggesting it is the market that alerts the CRAs of trouble and not vice versa.|$|E

Its broad corridors and deep recesses are filled with shepherdesses such as you never saw, dressed in beautiful shimmering gowns, and wearing feathers in their hair that droop off sideways at every angle known to trigonometry. And there are shepherds, too, with broad white waistcoats and little patent leather shoes and heavy faces and congested cheeks. And there is dancing and conversation among the shepherds and shepherdesses, with such brilliant flashes of wit and repartee about the rise in Wabash and the fall in Cement that the soul of Louis Quatorze would leap to hear it. And later there is supper at little tables, when the shepherds and shepherdesses consume <b>preferred</b> <b>stocks</b> and gold-interest bonds in the shape of chilled champagne and iced asparagus, and great platefuls of dividends and special quarterly bonuses are carried to and fro in silver dishes by Chinese philosophers dressed up to look like waiters.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{operating}} performance of <b>preferred</b> <b>stock</b> issuers using {{the sample of}} <b>preferred</b> <b>stock</b> issues during 1991 - 2000.
