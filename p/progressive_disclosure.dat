5000|$|<b>Progressive</b> <b>disclosure</b> is an {{interaction}} design technique that sequences information and actions across several screens {{in order to}} reduce feelings of being overwhelmed for the user. By disclosing information progressively, you reveal only the essentials and help the user manage the complexity of feature-rich sites or applications. <b>Progressive</b> <b>disclosure</b> follows the typical notion of moving from [...] "abstract to specific"; only it may mean sequencing interactions and not necessarily level of detail (information). In other words, <b>progressive</b> <b>disclosure</b> is not just about displaying abstract then specific information, but rather about 'ramping up' the user from simple to more complex actions.|$|E

40|$|Automated {{assessment}} {{is an essential}} part of eLearning. Although comparatively easy for multiple choice questions (MCQs), automated {{assessment is}} more challenging when exercises involve languages used in computer science. In this particular case, the assessment is more than just grading and must include feedback that leads to the improvement of the students 2 ̆ 7 performance. This paper presents ongoing work to develop Kora, an automated diagram assessment tool with enhanced feedback, targeted to the multiple diagrammatic languages used in computer science. Kora builds on the experience gained with previous research, namely: a diagram assessment tool to compute differences between graphs; an IDE inspired web learning environment for computer science languages; and an extensible web diagram editor. Kora has several features to enhance feedback: it distinguishes syntactic and semantic errors, providing specialized feedback in each case; it provides <b>progressive</b> feedback <b>disclosure,</b> controlling the quality and quantity shown to each student after a submission; when possible, it integrates feedback within the diagram editor showing actual nodes and edges on the editor itself...|$|R
40|$|For centuries, large paper {{information}} graphics such as maps {{have been}} important cognitive artifacts in navigation, architecture, design, engineering, and scientific work. Paper-based work practices leverage the high resolution, low cost, reliability, mobility, and flexibility of paper — yet lack the interactivity afforded by digital technologies. This paper introduces Interactive Gigapixel Prints (GIGAprints), computer controlled large-scale paper displays that afford direct pen-based input. These paper prints are augmented with digital displays, integrating the high spatial resolution but low temporal resolution of wide-format printing with the lower spatial resolution but higher temporal resolution of digital displays. Using large paper displays and digital devices together as an ensemble leverages the relative benefits of each medium; GIGAprints afford both ambient awareness and simultaneous viewing and input from multiple users. The pen-based interaction includes selection, <b>progressive</b> information <b>disclosure,</b> filtering, and annotation. This paper contributes a design space for integrated paper and digital interactions, an infrastructure for creating interactive ensembles of large paper displays and digital devices, and four applications built using our infrastructure, each illustrating points in the design space...|$|R

The approach dubbed [...] "training wheels" [...] {{is one of the few}} references validating the technique. Carroll and Rosson (1997) pointed out that no empirical evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of <b>progressive</b> <b>disclosure</b> and that the training wheels approach only studied a [...] "single computer application (word processor) and a single interface style (menu based control)". While independent usability studies and consultancy research (including our own) has shown that appropriate usage of the technique is valuable, more empirical research is clearly required.|$|E

Consequently, we want to minimize utility loss as long as the privacy is preserved. In this chapter, we survey the utility-based privacy preservation methods systematically. We first briefly discuss the privacy models and utility measures, and then review four recently proposed methods for utilitybased privacy preservation. We first introduce the utility-based anonymization method for maximizing the quality of the anonymized data in query answering and discernability. Then we introduce the top-down specialization (TDS) method and the <b>progressive</b> <b>disclosure</b> algorithm (PDA) for privacy preservation in classification problems. Last, we introduce the anonymized marginal method, which publishes the anonymized projection of a table to increase the utility and satisfy the privacy requirement. ...|$|E

40|$|Deictic {{gestures}} are gestures we make during {{communication to}} point at objects or persons. Indicative acts of directing-to guide the addressee to an object, while placing-for acts place an object for the addressee’s attention. Commonly used presentation software tools, such as PowerPoint and Keynote, offer ample support for placing-for gestures, e. g. slide transitions, <b>progressive</b> <b>disclosure</b> of list items and animations. Such presentation tools, however, do not generally offer adequate {{support for the}} directing-to indicative act (i. e. pointing gestures). In this paper we argue the value of presenting deictic gestures to a remote audience. Our research approach is threefold: identify indicative acts that are naturally produced by presenters; design tangible gestures for multi-touch surfaces that replicate the intent of those indicative acts; and design a set of graphical effects for remote viewing that best represent these indicative acts for the audience.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{how we have}} successful adapted a principled pedagogy of objects first and <b>progressive</b> <b>disclosure,</b> originally developed for teaching objects concepts through the vehicle of a pure object language, {{to the teaching of}} object concepts using Java. We employ a cognitive science viewpoint to distinguish between, and sequence accordingly, two different aspects of learning Java. We focus initially on fundamental aspects of the object model of computation, which are simple, consistent, meaningful, and hence relatively stable in memory. Aspects of the Java syntax and semantics which are contingent or arbitrary, and hence unstable in long-term memory, are deferred until after students have acquired a secure conceptual model. We use three principal techniques to assist students in acquiring programming experience of fundamental concepts relatively un-distracted by contingent detail. These measures are: interactive microworlds that allow accurate visualisation of central object concepts; a Java scripting environment that minimises the amount of syntax required, but which allows students to interact with and inspect 'live ' objects in the microworlds; and an explicitly object-oriented (if verbose) programming style that reinforces object-oriented concepts. Dealing with Java-specific design peculiarities is thus deferred until students have a stable conceptual model on which to scaffold a deeper understanding of objects...|$|E
40|$|The GOUVERNe {{project has}} {{developed}} a quality assured information system for the improved governance of groundwater resources at the catchment and sub-catchment levels. It required the design and implementation of a Tool to Inform Debates, Dialogues & Deliberations (TIDDD), combining traditional features of decision support systems (such as organisation of the information and tools for exploitation of the information) with {{an awareness of the}} new context of management and governance in which they are embedded. Both the information contents and the ‘exploration’ tools follow the principle of <b>progressive</b> <b>disclosure</b> of information, i. e. the TIDDD does not assume an expert use but it progressively enables the exploration of scientific and technical information, as users become in need of those.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a communication-minded visualization called progressive multiples that supports both the forensic analysis and presentation of multidimensional event data. We combine ideas from <b>progressive</b> <b>disclosure,</b> which reveals {{data to the}} user on demand, and small multiples [21], which allows users to compare many images at once. Sets of events are visualized as timelines. Events are placed in temporal order on the x-axis, and a scalar dimension of the data is mapped to the y-axis. To support forensic analysis, users can pivot from an event in an existing timeline {{to create a new}} timeline of related events. The timelines serve as an exploration history, which has two benefits. First, this exploration history allows users to backtrack and explore multiple paths. Second, once a user has concluded an analysis, these timelines serve as the raw visual material for composing a story about the analysis. A narrative that conveys the analytical result can be created for a third party by copying and reordering timelines from the history. Our work is motivated by working with network security administrators and researchers in political communication. We describe a prototype that we are deploying with administrators and the results of a user study where we applied our technique to the visualization of a simulated epidemic.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: How medical {{students}} handle negative emotions expressed by simulated patients during Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCE) {{has not been}} fully investigated. We aim to explore (i) whether {{medical students}} respond differently to different types of patients' emotional cues; and (2) possible effects of patients' <b>progressive</b> <b>disclosure</b> of emotional cues on students' responses. METHODS: Forty OSCE consultations were video recorded and coded for patients' expressions of emotional distress and students' responses using a validated behavioural coding scheme (the Verona Coding Definitions of Emotional Sequence). Logistic multilevel regression was adopted to model the probability of the occurrence of student reduce space response behaviour {{as a function of}} the number of patients' expressions of emotional cues. RESULTS: We found that medical students offered responses that differed to emotional cue types expressed by simulated patients. Students appeared to provide space to emotional cues when expressed in vague and unspecific words and reduce space to cues emphasizing physiological or cognitive correlates. We also found that medical students were less likely to explore patients' emotional distress nearer the end of the consultation and when the duration of a patient speech turn got larger. Cumulative frequency of patients' emotional cues also predicted students' reduce space behaviour. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Understanding how medical students manage negative emotions has significant implications for training programme development focusing on emotion recognition skills and patient-centred communication approach. In addition, the statistical approaches adopted by this study will encourage researchers in healthcare communication to search for appropriate analytical techniques to test theoretical propositions...|$|E
40|$|While the syncretistic Tibetan {{tradition}} {{known as}} rDzogs chen ("Great Perfection") has attracted considerable attention {{over the past}} few decades, its philosophical foundations remain largely unknown to those unacquainted with its primary sources. This thesis looks at the essentials of rDzogs chen philosophy through the lens of two principal distinctions that the tradition has considered indispensable for understanding its distinctive views and practices: dualistic mind (sems) versus primordial knowing (ye shes) and dharmakâya versus the 'ground of all' (kun gzhi) conditioned experience. Arguing that the distinctions provided classical rDzogs chen scholars with a crucial framework for (a) articulating the necessary conditions of nondual primordial knowing, the conditio sine qua non of rNying ma soteriology, and (b) schematizing the relationship between the exoteric and esoteric vehicles of Indian Buddhism within a unifying conception of the Buddhist path as the <b>progressive</b> <b>disclosure</b> of primordial knowing, the thesis shows how the rDzogs chen philosophy of mind has been integral to the tradition's complex soteriology. The thesis consists of two parts: (1) a detailed philosophical investigation of the distinctions and (2) an anthology of previously untranslated Tibetan materials on the distinctions accompanied by critical editions and introductions. The first part systematically invesigates the nature and scope of the distinctions and traces their evolution and complex relationships with Indian Buddhist Cittamâtra, Madhyamaka, Pramàriavàda, and Vajrayâna views. It concludes with an exploration of some soteriological implications of the mind/primordial knowing distinction that became central to rDzogs chen path hermeneutics in the classical period as authors of rDzogs chen path summaries used this distinction to reconcile progressivist sutric and non-progressivist tantric models of the Buddhist path. The translations and texts included in part two of the thesis consist of (a) a short treatise from Klong chen pa's Miscellaneous Writings entitled Sems dang ye shes kyi dris lan (Reply to Questions Concerning Mind and Primordial Knowing), (b) selected passages on the distinctions from this author's monumental summary of the rDzogs chen snying thig system, the Theg mchog mdzod (Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle), and (c) an excerpt on rDzogs chen distinctions taken from 'Jigs med gling pa's (1729 - 1798) 18 th century Klong chen sNying thig path summary entitled Treasury of Qualities (Yon tan mdzod) along with a word-by- word commentary by Yon tan rgya mtsho (b. 19 th c.) ...|$|E
