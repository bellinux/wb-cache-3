5|$|The {{naming of}} the {{stations}} caused local debate. A draft for names {{were made by}} the municipal administration and then sent to the borough councils in Fana, Årstad and Bergenhus. Four names were changed: Nonneseteren from Jernbanen, Florida from Strømmen, Brann stadion from Nymark and Hop from Troldhaugen. Brann stadion and Troldhaugen were afterwards considered by the municipal administration, because they could be in violation of the <b>Place</b> <b>Name</b> Act. The general rule is to use the <b>place</b> <b>name</b> where the station is located, and naming after institutions or facilities nearby is not permitted unless they are in the immediate vicinity. Brann stadion, named for the football venue, was declared a borderline case, but within the rules, while Troldhaugen was not permitted because the area is not {{in the vicinity of the}} station.|$|E

The Camuston Cross, once thought to mark the place of Camus' death, is now {{thought to be a}} late Pictish era monument, dating from the 10th Century. It should be noted that 'Camus' is not recognisable as a Scandinavian name, and that there are earlier variants of the <b>place</b> <b>name,</b> e.g. 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425–6, which has a Celtic etymology.|$|E
5|$|In the Firth of Clyde, Norse burials {{have been}} found on Arran, {{although}} not Bute and <b>place</b> <b>name</b> evidence suggests a settlement pattern that was much less well-developed than in the Hebrides.

Five Hogback monuments found in Govan hint at Scandinavian enclaves inland.|$|E
5|$|The Life is {{difficult}} to follow and extremely vague on any facts. Typically the author takes facts and traditions known to him and transfers them to the saint himself.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the meaning of <b>place</b> <b>names</b> in poetry, {{especially}} in the poetry of the norwegian poet Tor Jonsson. It is a common view among many scholars that names have no sense or only a minimal sense, and that their meaning is mostly to refer to certain objects. In this thesis the author argues the view that <b>place</b> <b>names</b> often have {{a great amount of}} meaning attached to them. The meaning attached to <b>place</b> <b>names</b> is mostly connotations. Since the thesis deals with <b>place</b> <b>names</b> in literature, no distinction is made between "sense" and "meaning" of a word. <b>Place</b> <b>names</b> often have stories attached to them, and <b>place</b> <b>names</b> are also important to both personal and group identity.

5|$|The <b>place</b> <b>name</b> Orange has a {{separate}} etymology. The Roman-Celtic settlement {{was founded in}} 36 or 35 BC and originally named Arausio, after a Celtic water god. The Principality of Orange was named for this place {{and not for the}} color. Some time after the sixteenth century, though, the color orange was adopted as a canting symbol of the House of Orange-Nassau. The color eventually came to be associated with Protestantism, due to participation by the House of Orange on the Protestant side in the French Wars of Religion and the Dutch Eighty Years' War.|$|E
5|$|The {{vehicles}} of each patrol adopted their own markings. The New Zealand 'R' Patrol used a green Hei-tiki {{with a red}} tongue painted {{on the right side}} of the bonnet of the vehicle, and on the left a Māori <b>place</b> <b>name</b> beginning with the letter 'R' (for example, 'Rotowaro'). The 'T' Patrol vehicles had a black Kiwi over green 'grass' and a Māori name starting with 'Te' (for example, 'Te Anau') in the corresponding places. The 'W' Patrol vehicles had a Māori name or word starting with 'W' painted on their vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{place names}} in Scandinavia contain the Old Norse name Þórr. The {{identification}} of these place names as pointing to religious significance {{is complicated by}} the aforementioned common usage of Þórr as a personal name element. Cultic significance may only be assured in place names containing the elements -vé (signifying the location of a vé, a type of pagan Germanic shrine), –hof (a structure used for religious purposes, see heathen hofs), and –lundr (a holy grove). The <b>place</b> <b>name</b> Þórslundr is recorded with particular frequency in Denmark (and has direct cognates in Norse settlements in Ireland, such as Coill Tomair), whereas Þórshof appears particularly often in southern Norway. Torsö (Thor's Island) appears on the Swedish westcoast. Thor also appears in many placenames in Uppland.|$|E

5|$|The ounceland system {{seems to}} have become {{widespread}} down the west coast including much of Argyll, {{and most of the}} south west apart from a region near the inner Solway Firth. In Dumfries and Galloway the <b>place</b> <b>name</b> evidence is complex and of mixed Gaelic, Norse and Danish influence, the last most likely stemming from contact with the extensive Danish holdings in northern England. Although the Scots obtained greater control after the death of Gilla Brigte and the accession of Lochlann in 1185, Galloway was not fully absorbed by Scotland until 1235, after the rebellion of the Galwegians was crushed.|$|E
5|$|The {{second of}} these {{theories}} is the genocide hypothesis, which {{asserts that the}} aboriginal populations of the Northern and Western Isles were eradicated and replaced wholesale with settlers of Scandinavian stock. The strength of this argument is the almost total replacement of pre-existing place names by those of Norse origin {{throughout much of the}} region. Its weakness is that the <b>place</b> <b>name</b> evidence is from a relatively late date and the nature of this transition remains controversial. Genetic studies show that Shetlanders have almost identical proportions of Scandinavian matrilineal and patrilineal ancestry, suggesting that the islands were settled by both men and women in equal measure.|$|E
5|$|This period saw {{dramatic}} changes in the geography of language. Modern linguists divide the Celtic languages into two major groups, the P-Celtic, from which Welsh, Breton and Cornish derive and the Q-Celtic, from which comes Irish, Manx and Gaelic. The Pictish language remains enigmatic, since the Picts had no written script of their own and all that survives are place names and some isolated inscriptions in Irish ogham script. Most modern linguists accept that, although the nature and unity of Pictish language is unclear, it belonged to the former group.

5|$|After {{the islands}} were {{transferred}} to Scotland, thousands of Scots families emigrated to Shetland in the 16th and 17th centuries but studies of the genetic makeup of the islands' population indicate that Shetlanders are just under half Scandinavian in origin. A sizeable component of Scandinavian patrilineal ancestry {{has been reported in}} Orkney (55%) and Shetland (68%). This combination is reflected in many aspects of local life. For example, almost every <b>place</b> <b>name</b> in use {{can be traced back to}} the Vikings. The Norn language was a form of Old Norse, which continued to be spoken until the 18th century when it was replaced by an insular dialect of Scots known as Shetlandic, which is in turn being replaced by Scottish English. Although Norn was spoken for hundreds of years it is now extinct and few written sources remain. Shetlandic is used both in local radio and dialect writing, and kept alive by the Shetland Folk Society.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{linguists}} divide Celtic languages {{into two}} major groups, the P-Celtic, {{from which the}} Brythonic languages: Welsh, Breton, Cornish and Cumbric derive, and the Q-Celtic, from which come the Goidelic languages: Irish, Manx and Gaelic. The Pictish language remains enigmatic, since the Picts had no written script {{of their own and}} all that survives are place names and some isolated inscriptions in Irish ogham script. Most modern linguists accept that, although the nature and unity of Pictish language is unclear, it belonged to the former group. Historical sources, as well as <b>place</b> <b>name</b> evidence, indicate {{the ways in which the}} Pictish language in the north and Cumbric languages in the south were overlaid and replaced by Gaelic, Old English and later Norse in this period. By the High Middle Ages the majority of people within Scotland spoke the Gaelic language, then simply called Scottish, or in Latin, lingua Scotica. The Kingdom of Alba was overwhelmingly an oral society dominated by Gaelic culture. Our fuller sources for Ireland of the same period suggest that there would have been filidh, who acted as poets, musicians and historians, often attached to the court of a lord or king, and passed on their knowledge and culture in Gaelic to the next generation.|$|E
5|$|Place-name {{evidence}} suggests that the densest areas of Pictish settlement were in the north-east coastal plain: in modern Fife, Perthshire, Angus, Aberdeen and around the Moray Firth, although later Gaelic migration may have erased some Pictish names from the record. Early Gaelic settlement appears to have been in the regions of the western mainland of Scotland between Cowal and Ardnamurchan, and the adjacent islands, later extending up the West coast in the eighth century. There is <b>place</b> <b>name</b> and archaeological evidence of Anglian settlement in south-east Scotland reaching into West Lothian, {{and to a lesser extent}} into south-western Scotland. Later Norse settlement was probably most extensive in Orkney and Shetland, with lighter settlement in the Western Islands, particularly the Hebrides and on the mainland in Caithness, stretching along fertile river valleys through Sutherland and into Ross. There was also extensive settlement in Bernicia stretching into the modern borders and Lowlands.|$|E

The civil war resulted in the death of at least 100,000 people and, according to human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch, the forced disappearance of thousands of others (see White van abductions in Sri Lanka). Since 1983, Sri Lanka has also witnessed massive civilian displacements of more than a million people, with eighty percent of them being Sri Lankan Tamils.|$|E
5|$|As a <b>place</b> <b>name,</b> Trafford is an Anglo-French {{version of}} Stratford, {{deriving}} from the Old English words stræt (a street, more specifically a Roman road) and ford (a river crossing). The Metropolitan Borough of Trafford has existed since 1974, but the area it covers {{has a long}} history. Neolithic arrowheads have been discovered in Altrincham and Sale, and {{there is evidence of}} Bronze Age habitation in Timperley. Fragments of Roman pottery have been found in Urmston, and Roman coins have been found in Sale. The Roman road between the legionary fortresses at Chester (Deva Victrix) and York (Eboracum) crosses Trafford, passing through Stretford, Sale, and Altrincham. The settlements in Trafford have been based largely around agriculture, although Altrincham was founded as a market town in the mid 13th century. Although the Industrial Revolution affected Trafford, the area did not experience the same rate of growth as the rest of Greater Manchester. A 100% increase in population in the Trafford area between 1841 and 1861 was a direct result of an influx due to the construction of the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway, which allowed residents to more easily commute from Trafford into Manchester. The area developed its own centres of industry in Broadheath (founded in 1885) and Trafford Park (founded in 1897). They have since declined, although Trafford Park still employs 40–50,000 people. Today, Trafford is mostly a commuter area. The borough was formed on 1April 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972 as one of the ten metropolitan districts of Greater Manchester.|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, Alaska Native peoples {{have used}} <b>place</b> <b>names</b> to {{describe}} conditions and origins of places and to guide travelers {{from place to}} <b>place.</b> They <b>name</b> <b>places</b> based on their oral narratives, daily activities, and multi-generational observations of the landscape. When Western traders and explorers arrived in Alaska, they replaced Native <b>place</b> <b>names</b> with Russian and English names making natural resources extraction easier. However, many Yup’ik language speakers still use and pass down their local <b>place</b> <b>names</b> for safe travels and resource harvesting today. This project uses a community based-participatory method to document Yup’ik <b>place</b> <b>names</b> in the Iliamna Lake communities, Alaska. The four Iliamna Lake communities in Southwest Alaska include Dena’ina, Central Yup’ik, and Alutiiq language groups. Dena’ina <b>place</b> <b>names</b> in the Iliamna-Lake Clark area are well documented; however, not many Yup’ik <b>place</b> <b>names</b> {{are found in the}} literature (Kari 2010). In this research, local <b>place</b> <b>names</b> are called vernacular <b>place</b> <b>names</b> because a <b>place</b> may vary according to different local usages. Native <b>place</b> <b>names</b> show the peoples’ ways of understanding the landscape and allow them to show respect for their ancestors’ lands. <b>Place</b> <b>names</b> connect Native languages and peoples to the landscape. By documenting and understanding local <b>place</b> <b>names,</b> the Iliamna Lake residents can strengthen their connections to their land, an expression of their identity and a connection to their ancestors. Understanding the meaning of <b>place</b> <b>names</b> and using them in daily activities strengthens the interconnections among the people, their ancestors, the spiritual realm, and the ecological system as a whole. In the Yup’ik worldview, people have reciprocal relationships with the land: the peoples’ awareness of landscape and their daily activities reflect the landscape’s wellbeing (Kawagley 1995). The loss of Native languages is crucial to the loss of <b>place</b> <b>names</b> and socio-cultural connections of relationships between people and land. If Alaska Native peoples stop using traditional <b>place</b> <b>names,</b> their ability to pass on traditional environmental knowledge will be undermined. By using their local <b>place</b> <b>names,</b> the Iliamna Lake residents can strengthen their connections to their land and their ancestors’ wisdom, crucial for maintaining wellbeing in the communities.
