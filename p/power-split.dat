40|$|Heavy-duty {{diesel engines}} {{are used in}} a wide range of applications. For varying {{operating}} environments, the engine and aftertreatment system must comply with the real-world emission legislation limits. Simultaneously, minimal fuel consumption and good drivability are crucial for economic competitiveness and usability. Meeting these requirements takes substantial development and calibration effort, and complying with regulations results in a trade-off between emissions and fuel consumption. TNO's Integrated Emission Management (IEM) strategy finds online, the cost-optimal point in this trade-off and is able to deal with variations in operating conditions, while complying with legislation limits. Based on the actual state of the engine and aftertreatment system, an optimal engine operating point is computed using a model-based optimal-control algorithm. A novel feature introduced in this work is the addition of a feedback scheme to control the tailpipe NOx emissions through modification of the Lagrange multiplier in the optimal control algorithm. The Lagrange multiplier represents the penalty on tailpipe NOx emissions in the optimal control problem. This feature provides In-Service Conformity (ISC) in real-life operation and adds robustness, in terms of emissions, to system disturbances, such as production tolerances, system ageing and sensor or actuator errors. The IEM strategy is a generic toolkit and can incorporate additional optimization variables, provided their effects are accurately represented by the online models of the engine and aftertreatment system. This can be used to include additional degrees of freedom such as fuel injection timing, pressure, pre- and post-injections and <b>power-splits</b> for hybrid drivelines. IEM is capable of real-time implementation and has previously been operated on an engine testbed, showing up to 2 % reduction in fuel consumption that can be translated into a corresponding CO 2 emission reduction...|$|R

50|$|The Two-Mode Hybrid name {{highlights}} the drive-train's ability {{to operate in}} all-electric (Mode 1, or Input-Split) as well as hybrid (Mode 2, or Compound-Split) modes.

Such a design can be referred to as a multi-regime design. The Two-Mode Hybrid powertrain design can be classified as a compound-split design, since the addition of four clutches within the transmission allows for multiple configurations of engine power-splitting. In addition to the clutches, this transmission has a second planetary gearset. The objective of the design is to vary the percentage of mechanically vs. electrically transmitted power to cope both with low-speed and high-speed operating conditions. This enables smaller motors to do the job of larger motors when compared to single-mode systems, because the derived electrical peak power is proportional to the width of the continuous variation range. The four fixed gears enable the Two-Mode Hybrid to function like a conventional parallel hybrid under high continuous power regions such as sustained high speed cruising or trailer towing.

This in turn makes this setup very simple in mechanical terms, but has drawbacks of its own.

The Generation 3 HSD separates the ICE-MG1 path from the MG2 path, each with its own, tailored gear ratio (1.1:1 and 2.5:1, respectively, for late Priuses, including the Prius c). The Generation 4 HSD eliminates the second planetary gear set, and places the electric motors on parallel axes, with a combining gear in between these axes, and transfers the combined result to the final drive differential.

40|$|Abstract—Power-split hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (HEVs) provide {{a great opportunity}} to improve fuel economy and emissions. This <b>power-split</b> hybrid system has inherent low damping in driveline since it uses planetary gear sets to directly connect the engine, the generator, and the motor to the driveline for improved vehicle efficiency, thus lacking a clutch or a torque converter that provides the conventional vehicles with driveline damping. When they are subjected to acceleration or disturbances, the low damping in the driveline may cause torsional vibrations. Since the <b>power-split</b> control system is closed loop in nature, these torsional vibrations can result in sustained driveline oscillations. These oscillations can be very objectionable to the driver as they affect the vehicle’s drivability. In this paper, we present the design of an active damping wheel-torque control system to suppress such oscilla-tions to improve the drivability of a <b>power-split</b> HEV. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported use of an active damping wheel-torque control system to suppress the driveline oscillations in a <b>power-split</b> HEV. Simulations in a <b>power-split</b> HEV environment and experimental tests in the field using a Ford Escape Hybrid demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in suppressing the oscillations. The driveline disturbances are suppressed to below the perceptible level of wheel torque (< 100 N · m). Additional simulations are performed to validate the system to other key factors that can affect its performance. Even with increased motor/generator disturbances by a factor of 2 and change in driveline stiffness of ± 50 %, the proposed control system can still effectively suppress driveline oscillations and thereby improve drivability.
