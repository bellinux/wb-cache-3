50|$|The Swahili sparrow (Passer suahelicus) is a {{passerine}} bird of the sparrow family Passeridae. It {{lives in}} the savanna of southern Kenya and Tanzania. Until recently, it was usually treated as a subspecies of the northern grey-headed sparrow (<b>Passer</b> <b>griseus),</b> which it hybridizes with in southern Tanzania and possibly elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} {{grey-headed sparrow}} (<b>Passer</b> <b>griseus),</b> {{also known as}} the grey-headed or common grey-headed sparrow, is a species of bird in the sparrow family Passeridae, which is resident in much of tropical Africa. It occurs {{in a wide range of}} open habitats, including open woodlands and human habitation, often occupying the same niche as the house sparrow does in Eurasia.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} diet {{composition}} of Northern Grey-headed Sparrow <b>Passer</b> <b>griseus</b> and Southern Red Bishop Euplectes orix in four localities of the Rusizi Plain, northwest Burundi. We analyzed crop contents of 100 adults {{from each of}} the two species and the composition of food brought by parents to nestlings of the sparrow at ten nests. In all four sites, the sparrowâ€™s diet consisted primarily of rice. The bishop also fed mostly on rice grains but also ate Lepidoptera caterpillars, some other insects and wild grass seeds such as Panicum sp. and Brachiaria sp. For adults of both bird species, there was no significant variation in diet throughout the year. However, the diet of young sparrows was much more diverse and changed from the day of hatching until fledging. On the day of hatching, chicks ate mainly caterpillars but by the tenth day, food items comprised one third caterpillars, one third Orthoptera and the rest of other insects including Odonata, Dictyoptera, Isoptera and adult Lepidoptera. After this and until fledging, the chicks were fed increasingly on rice seeds. Simultaneously, the proportion of caterpillars taken gradually decreased until none was fed to the nestlings {{at the end of the}} nestling period. The items brought by parents also varied with time of day, with caterpillars and grasshoppers in higher proportions in the morning, decreasing around mid-day and then increasing in the evening.

40|$|Hosts {{can manage}} {{parasitic}} infections using {{an array of}} tactics, which are likely to vary contingent on coevolutionary history between the host and the parasite. Here we asked whether coping ability of congeners that differ in host-parasite coevolutionary history differed in response to experimental infections with a coccidian parasite. House sparrows (Passer domesticus) and gray-headed sparrows (<b>Passer</b> <b>griseus)</b> are sympatric and ecologically similar, but house sparrows are recent colonizers of Kenya, the site of our comparison, whereas gray-headed sparrows are native. We evaluated three variables as barometers of infection coping ability: vertical flight, pectoral muscle size, and fat score. We also measured routing of a dose of 13 C-labeled leucine, an essential amino acid, among tissues to compare resource allocation strategies in response to infection. We found that burden effects on performance were minimal in both species, but house sparrows maintained considerably higher burdens than gray-headed sparrows regardless of exposure. House sparrows also had more exogeneous leucine tracer in all tissues after 24 h, demonstrating {{a difference in the}} way the two species allocate or distribute resources. We argue that house sparrows may be maintaining larger resource reserves to mitigate costs associated with exposure and infection. Additionally, in response to increased parasite exposure, gray-headed sparrows had less leucine tracer in their spleens and more in their gonads, whereas house sparrows did not change allocation, perhaps indicating a trade-off that is not experienced by the introduced species...|$|E
40|$|The House Sparrow Passer domesticus, an {{introduced}} species, and the Grey-headed Sparrow <b>Passer</b> <b>griseus,</b> {{an indigenous}} species, are sympatric in Malawi. Their {{distribution in the}} country and any possible interactions were studied, principally in southern Malawi. A morphological analysis of museum specimens confirmed that grey-headed sparrows in Malawi belong to the Northern Grey-headed Sparrow <b>Passer</b> <b>griseus</b> as distinct from the Southern Grey-headed Sparrow Passer diffusus. This species was widely distributed in the, country in association with human dwellings, both in rural areas as well as urban centres. In the northern region Greyheaded Sparrows were more abundant in the urban centres than rural areas, but in the central and southern regions numbers in the rural and urban areas were more or less the same. In Blantyre City, where they are in sympatry with the House Sparrow, they were found in the low density and industrial areas and were absent from the high density areas. The House Sparrow, arrived in Malawi in 1967 at Chileka in the southern region. Since then it has spread northwards, moving from the southern to the central and northern regions. House Sparrow numbers were found to be progressively larger in the southern region and lowest in the northern region. House Sparrows were found at sites where food was readily available, as in the immediate vicinity of houses. In the central and northern regions they were restricted mainly to urban areas. In the southern region, they occur both in rural and urban areas, probably as a reflection of the larger period of colonization in the south. In the northern region their movement has apparently been restricted by geographical barriers. In Blantyre City Grey-headed Sparrows preferred areas where tree density was high and house density was low, while House Sparrows preferred areas where house density was high and tree density was low. There was a positive correlation between Greyheaded Sparrow numbers and tree density and a negative correlation with house density. House Sparrow abundance was negatively correlated with tree density and positively correlated with house density. Grey-headed Sparrows bred in the rainy season, whereas House Sparrows bred throughout the year. There were differences in nest site selection: Grey-headed Sparrows used artificial structures such as fencing poles, and wooden telephone or electricity poles. The House Sparrow used mostly buildings and nested in crevices, holes in walls and between the walls and rafters. Nest height also differed- Grey-headed Sparrows nested at heights ranging from 1 - 8 m while House Sparrow nests were at heights of 1 - 5 m. Moult data suggests that although the House Sparrows breed throughout the year, they moult at a particular time of the year when breeding is less common. Grey-headed Sparrows were found to moult mainly from May to September in southern Africa and from June to September in central Africa. In both cases the breeding season extends over a similar period from about October to April/May of the following year. Peak moult periods differed between the House Sparrows and Grey-headed Sparrows. House Sparrows moulted mainly {{in the first half of}} the year, and Greyheaded Sparrows in the second six months. The clutch sizes of the two species were similar (mean 3. 9 eggs for the House Sparrow and 3. 4 for the Grey-headed Sparrow). The clutch size of the House Sparrow varied seasonally and was larger from November to May. The average incubation period for the House Sparrow was 11. 5 days and the fledging period 15. 4 days. The Grey-headed Sparrow fledging period was 14. 7 days. Chick mortality of the House Sparrow at Chikunda farm was attributed to starvation resulting from brood reduction, abandonment, predation, low birth weight, accidental deaths and parasitism by fly larvae. Both Grey-headed and House Sparrows fed their young on insect food. Male House Sparrows fed actively initially, but their contribution declined from about day five onwards. In the Grey-headed Sparrow, both parents fed their young equally throughout the nestling period. House Sparrows fed on the ground near houses; Grey-headed Sparrows fed both on the ground away from houses and in tree canopies. The Grey-headed Sparrow walked as it fed on the ground as opposed to the House sparrow which hopped. Grey-headed Sparrows fed mainly as pairs and singletons while House Sparrows fed as family groups. Larger feeding groups of Grey-headed Sparrows were seen in the northern region at areas where food was plentiful. Where the two sparrows were seen feeding together, there was no direct competition for food. Where individual distance was violated; male House Sparrows displaced Grey-headed Sparrows which landed too close to them. Overall it appears that the distribution of the two species is determined more by their responses to habitat conditions than by interspecific interactions...|$|E
