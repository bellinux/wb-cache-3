40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of trade policy changes on the {{evolution}} of plant productivity. Plant level productivities are estimated for the 1983 - 96 period following the procedure of Olley and Pakes (1996). Industry averages indicate that productivity gains are largest in import competing industries with highest gains reaching to 8 % per year during periods of rapid decline in <b>protection</b> <b>rates.</b> A decomposition of industry level productivity gains also suggests important differences across sectors by trade orientation. Though reallocation of market shares to more productive plants are important in both export oriented, and import competing sectors, within plant productivity improvements are significant only in export-oriented sectors. We also investigate the effects of changes in <b>protection</b> <b>rates</b> on plant level productivities using regressions that control for endogeneity of <b>protection</b> <b>rates</b> (tariff and non-tariff).

Methods In the years 2002 - 2009 an annually repeated cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was conducted at the Dutch Schiphol Airport with the aim to study trends in KAP of travel risk groups toward prevention of hepatitis B. The frequently encountered risk groups last-minute travellers, solo-travellers, business travellers, travellers {{visiting friends and relatives}} (VFR) and elderly travellers were specifically studied. Results A total of 3045 respondents were included in the survey. Travellers to destinations with a high risk for hepatitis B had significantly less accurate risk perceptions (knowledge) than travellers to low-risk destinations but no differences were observed in past risk-taking attitude. <b>Protection</b> <b>rates</b> against hepatitis B were significantly higher in travellers to high-risk destinations. There was a positive trend over the years in the proportion of travellers to high-risk destinations seeking travel health advice.

40|$|This {{paper has}} two aims. A {{specific}} {{goal is to}} examine the determinants of protection policy in Turkey. A second, broader goal is to test the recent insights of the political economy models of trade policy and assess their contribution to the empirical investigation of associations between <b>protection</b> <b>rate</b> and industry characteristics. The paper develops a stylized model that captures the key common results of the new political economy models of trade policy, which show that import penetration and price elasticity of import demand act as weights in the relationship between an industry's <b>protection</b> <b>rate</b> and its political characteristics. We find that adhering to the specific functional form that the theory generates substantially improves the explanatory power of industry characteristics in our econometric work on Turkish data. The results show that <b>protection</b> <b>rate</b> is higher for industries with smaller, less capital-intensive firms and low wage workers. Interestingly, these effects vanish when such firms are publicly owned. These outcomes suggest that the risk-mitigating role of trade barriers is an important factor driving government policy in Turkey. The finding implies that continued move toward openness to international trade require progress in fiscal systems or domestic and international institutions that can deal with the economic insecurities generated by globalization. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Praziquantel {{has been}} used as {{first-line}} drug for chemotherapy of schistosomiasis since 1984. Besides praziquantel, artemether and artesunate have also been used for the control of this infectious disease since late 1990 s. In this article, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the antischistosomal efficacy of different medication strategies including monotherapy or combination therapies of these drugs. Results A number of 52 trials from 38 articles published in peer-reviewed journals before July 2011 were selected for analysis after searching the following literature databases: the Cochrane Library, PubMed/Medline, ISI Web of Science, Chinese Biomedicine Literature Database, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. Our meta-analyses showed that a dosage of 30 - 60 mg/kg praziquantel compared with placebo produced a <b>protection</b> <b>rate</b> of about 76 % (95 % CI: 67 %- 83 %) for treating human schistosomiasis, which varied from 70 % to 76 % with no significant differences among the subspecies S. haematobium, S. japonicum or S. mansoni. Protection rates were higher when praziquantel doses were elevated, as concluded from the nRCTs results: the <b>protection</b> <b>rate</b> of praziquantel at 40 mg/kg was 52 % (95 % CI: 49 %- 55 %), and it increased to 91 % (95 % CI: 88 %- 92 %) when the dosages were elevated to 60 / 80 / 100 mg/kg divided two or more doses. Multiple doses of artemether or artesunate over 1 - or 2 -week intervals resulted in protection rates of 65 % to 97 % for preventing schistosomiasis, and increased doses and shorter medication intervals improved their efficacies. Praziquantel and artemisinin derivatives (artemether or artesunate) in combination resulted in a higher <b>protection</b> <b>rate</b> of 84 % (95 % CI: 64 %- 91 %) than praziquantel monotherapy for treatment. praziquantel and artesunate in combination had a great <b>protection</b> <b>rate</b> of 96 % (95 % CI: 78 %- 99 %) for preventing schistosomes infection. Conclusions According to the results, praziquantel remains effective in schistosomiasis treatment, and multiple doses would improve its efficacy; meanwhile, praziquantel is also a good drug for preventing acute schistosomiasis morbidity. It's better to use multiple doses of artemether or artesunate with 1 - or 2 -week intervals for prevention against schistosome infection. Praziquantel and artemether or artesunate in combination perform better in treatment than praziquantel monotherapy, and they are especially suitable for treating the patients with repeated exposure to infected water. </p...|$|E
