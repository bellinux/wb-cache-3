40|$|The {{foundation}} of <b>policing</b> <b>in</b> Nigeria today {{can be traced}} to colonial legacy. Colonial policies subjugated the existing traditional informal law enforcement order and forcefully imposed western idea of policing. Thus, policing within the context of oppression and gross misuse of power has been linked to western orientation. This imperial orientation is not only maintained and sustained by successive Nigerian administrations but also have serious implication for an effective <b>policing</b> <b>in</b> Nigeria. This paper identifies critical issues that are germane to <b>policing</b> <b>in</b> contemporary Nigeria. The paper further identifies some challenges that plague the police as an institution in the present democratic era. In spite of pervading problems and consequent challenges, the paper identities prospects in the sustenance of <b>policing</b> <b>in</b> the present democratic dispensation.

40|$|The {{central issue}} of this {{research}} revolves around the implementation of sector <b>policing</b> <b>in</b> the province of KwaZulu-Natal. The research is based <b>in</b> two <b>police</b> stations, that is, Nongoma and Newcastle. Sector policing is a policing strategy introduced by South African <b>Police</b> Service <b>in</b> 1994. The aim of this policing strategy {{is the creation of}} structured consultation with regards to local crime problems between the police and respective communities. The objective of sector policing is to develop an organizational structure and environment that reflects community values and facilitates community involvement in addressing risk factors and solve crime-related problems. The research problem for this study is that {{there is little or no}} research conducted on the implementation of sector <b>policing</b> <b>in</b> South Africa in general and Nongoma and Newcastle in particular. Following this problem statement, the following five research questions were formulated: What is sector policing and how does its implementation differ between the USA, the UK and South Africa? What is the status of the implementation of the sector <b>policing</b> <b>in</b> South Africa, in particular the Province of KwaZulu-Natal? What are the challenges experienced <b>in</b> implementing sector <b>policing</b> <b>in</b> Nongoma and Newcastle police stations? What are best practices that can be observed in the implementation of sector <b>policing</b> <b>in</b> these two <b>police</b> stations? What is the best possible way of implementing sector <b>policing</b> <b>in</b> South Africa? The aim of the research is to assess and describe the manner <b>in</b> which sector <b>policing</b> was implemented <b>in</b> the two <b>police</b> stations <b>in</b> KZN. The research findings obtained through interviews are analysed and interpreted. In view of the findings, best practices, and recommendations were formulated on how to overcome challenges that may face the implementation of sector <b>policing</b> <b>in</b> the province of KwaZulu-Natal.

5|$|This traditional, {{historical}} {{portrayal of}} the North-West Mounted Police influenced that of the RCMP, who used their predecessor's history {{to build their own}} status as a Canadian national symbol. Although the RCMP as an organisation formally dates from 1920, the modern force chose to trace its own history back to the foundation of the mounted <b>police</b> <b>in</b> 1873, rather than, for example, drawing on the Dominion Police's foundation date of 1868. The RCMP's centennial in 1973 saw celebratory events across Canada, various historical publications and even proposals – turned down by the mounted police – for a reenactment of the March West. The RCMP used the celebrations to redefine the early history of the mounted <b>police</b> <b>in</b> line with contemporary policing objectives, focusing on the force's role in shaping the evolution of a liberal, tolerant, modern Canada.|$|E
