5|$|The lake {{does not}} meet the National Water Quality Standards due to its high {{concentration}} of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). Considering the adverse impact on the lake water quality due to Eutrophication, anthropogenic pressures and holy rituals and tourism, a water quality study was specifically undertaken at four sites on a monthly basis for six months. The sampling sites were chosen to represent the pressure of pilgrims and other pollution inflows at the locations. The water samples were analysed for temperature, pH, salinity, conductivity, total dissolved solids, alkalinity, hardness, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, sodium, ammonium, potassium, total chlorophyll, biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand. The analysis over the period has revealed that the lake water was alkaline, chloride and conductivity concentrations were high at all the four sites, and there were lower levels of dissolved oxygen (at sites with greater <b>pollution</b> <b>load)</b> and high hardness (on account of excess of calcium and magnesium from surface run-off). During the period of the annual Pushkar Fair, a distinct co-relationship was discerned between various parameters analysed and the degree of water pollution in the lake. This has called for urgent remedial actions to be undertaken by all of the government agencies involved with the lake management, with people's participation.|$|E

50|$|To {{realize the}} {{objectives}} of the creation of LLDA, the agency implemented policies to curb the possibility of stressing the lake’s assimilative capacity.

The objective of the policy was to “…(reduce) the <b>pollution</b> <b>loading</b> in to the Laguna de Bay by enjoining all discharges of liquid wastes to internalize the cost of environmental degradation…”. Formally, the said board resolution aptly defined the EUFS as a “market-based” policy instrument aimed at reducing the <b>pollution</b> <b>loading</b> in the lake.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the efficiency, {{in terms of}} the reduction of both water volumes and <b>pollution</b> <b>loads</b> discharged to receiving water bodies, of first flush storage tanks in stormwater runoff networks of urban drainage systems, depending on their specific capacity, their kind (transit or capture) and their position inside networks collecting multiple subcatchments (one single tank downstream the whole system rather than multiple tanks, i. e. one per each subcatchment, in series or just in parallel). The numerically achieved results show that the distance between two confluences has a very slight influence on the amount of both water volumes and <b>pollution</b> <b>loads</b> washed off in wet weather from the catchment surfaces. On the contrary, as expected and as already known in literature, the capacity of the tanks has the most relevant role on annual basis in terms of both overflow volumes and discharged <b>pollution</b> <b>loads,</b> while a very smaller influence is related to their position. Moreover, it comes out that the bigger complexity of installation, operation and maintenance required for the capture kind of the first foul flush storage tanks, in comparison to the transit one, does make sense only when their specific capacity is significantly higher than 25 m³/ha...|$|R
