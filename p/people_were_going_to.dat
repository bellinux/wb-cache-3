It was written by Berman and Braga, who responded to negative criticism of the episode by saying [...] "You have to remember that under normal circumstances most people probably would have thought this was a very cool episode because it has a great concept driving it".

500|$|Svensson {{reported}} that the original game assets given to them from Capcom Japan were incomplete, and even after requesting old hard drives and computers to recover more assets, Ready at Dawn was still required to recreate some from scratch. Furthermore, the game had to be recoded to change optimizations that were made for the PlayStation 2 version; Svensson stated that [...] "part of the reason we didn't show it until we started showing it was because, if we showed it {{in a form that}} was anything less than near-perfect, <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> freak out". Ready at Dawn's creative director Ru Weerasuriya later reflected that porting Ōkami to the Wii was a challenging task—"we started with no assets and literally reverse-engineered the whole thing back onto the Wii"—they did out of love for the game, but the level of effort would preclude them from attempting such a port again.|$|E
500|$|... 30 years-old at {{the time}} of her audition, O'Hara {{consequently}} imbued Belle's voice with a mature, [...] "womanly quality" [...] despite the character's young age. Woolverton appreciated the fact that O'Hara sounded more mature than traditional Disney heroines. Additionally, O'Hara identified with her character because they were both ostracized by their peers throughout their childhood because of their unconventional interests, explaining, [...] "I was odd growing up myself. I mean, I was into musical theater and Gershwin and Rodgers and Hammerstein while <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Led Zeppelin concerts. So I understood that ... I wasn't the norm either. I was very focused on my career, on my performing all through my childhood and my teens ... I had a one-track mind, and I think that Belle was like that a lot." [...] O'Hara also shares Belle's interest in reading. Wise was pleased with the quality of O'Hara's voice, which reminded him of Garland. O'Hara initially found it challenging to control her speaking volume due to having been trained to project as a stage actress. O'Hara told The Guardian that to solve this she [...] "softened and used the microphone." [...] As per the filmmakers' encouragement, the actress would occasionally ad-lib her own dialogue, none was included in the final film because it sounded [...] "too modern". The animators would videotape O'Hara daily while she recorded to incorporate her [...] "quirky" [...] mannerisms, expressions and gestures into the character, among them her hair constantly falling into her eyes. O'Hara and American actor Robby Benson, who provides the voice of the Beast, asked Disney to allow the co-stars to record together as opposed to the traditional method of being isolated in a recording booth, to which the studio agreed despite its costliness. O'Hara credited the filmmaker's decision with developing both the film and Belle and the Beast's relationship. O'Hara and Benson became the first Disney voice actors to record together. In total, the recording process took over two years to complete. O'Hara had already been friends with co-star Richard White, who voices Gaston, for 15 years. Despite her successful stage career, O'Hara was virtually unknown to Hollywood audiences when she was cast in Beauty and the Beast; she was one of the last obscure actresses to be cast in a feature-length Disney animated film before the studio began casting better known talent in subsequent animated projects.|$|E

Actually, I wasn't taking a gamble at all." [...] The manifestation of this gamble was the eight-cylinder Winton 8-201A diesel, a creature no larger than a small Dumpster, that powered the Burlington Zephyr (built 1934) on its record run and opened the door for developing the long line of diesel engines that has powered Electro-Motive locomotives for the past seventy years.|$|E

Cast as Gutierrez, {{a young woman in}} love with an amphibian man, Vertinskaya had to go through difficult late autumn underwater shooting sessions which she performed all by herself, without any stuntwomen involved. The film became the Soviet 1962 box-office blockbuster. [...] "Vertinskaya was now a brand. <b>People</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the cinema to watch her, specifically," [...] her future husband Nikita Mikhalkov later recalled. All this changed the teenage actress's life dramatically. [...] "In those days there weren't any bodyguards. I used to travel by tram to my studies. I had to queue for bread like everyone else.

When asked if she would change anything about the video's production, Del Rey stated, [...] "Had I known so many <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> watch the video, I'd have put some more effort into it.

2500|$|Rick Rubin {{produced}} [...] "The Greatest Man That Ever Lived" [...] {{with the}} band between April 2007 and February 2008. In the liner notes of the deluxe edition of The Red Album, Cuomo stated that the song did not originally have the subtitle [...] "Variations on a Shaker Hymn", but when guitarist Brian Bell's mother came into the studio to see them, she mentioned that the melody from the song sounded similar to a Shaker hymn that the choir sang in her church. Cuomo wrote that he realised that people might notice the resemblance: [...] "I knew <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> come at us after and say 'Hey, you guys ripped off that hymn.' So I put the credit in there off the bat." [...] As a result, the band looked up the hymn and indeed the melody was so similar to Joseph Brackett's [...] "Simple Gifts" [...] that they credited the hymn with the subtitle.|$|E

But when the danger is over and the calamity has had its day, then there is all too quickly a relapse into the old ways of life, and the reconciliation coerced by the need sometimes carries within itself the seed of a deeper separation than the one that was eliminated. And even if that reconciliation casts an enhancing radiance over the period of the individual's lives, it nevertheless belongs essentially not to them but to the observation and the observer who inherits it, until the story about it is also forgotten. Even though it is beautiful to envision this, such a life is a life of temporality, is the fruit of temporality, but also the prey of temporality, and the most that can be said of it is that it was a beautiful moment.
