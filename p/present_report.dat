2500|$|On September 20, 1765, Antoine {{had killed}} his third large grey wolf {{measuring}} [...] high, [...] long, and weighing [...] The wolf, which was named Le Loup de Chazes after the nearby Abbaye des Chazes, {{was said to}} have been quite large for a wolf. Antoine officially stated: [...] "We declare by the <b>present</b> <b>report</b> signed from our hand, we never saw a big wolf that could be compared to this one. Which is why we estimate this could be the fearsome beast that caused so much damage." [...] The animal was further identified as the culprit by attack survivors who recognised the scars on its body inflicted by victims defending themselves. The wolf was stuffed and sent to Versailles where Antoine was received as a hero, receiving a large sum of money as well as titles and awards.|$|E

60|$|I {{have only}} to add, that the verdict at the Coroner's Inquest was Wilful Murder against some person, or persons, unknown. Mr. Ablewhite's family have offered a reward, and no effort has been left untried to {{discover}} the guilty persons. The man dressed like a mechanic has eluded all inquiries. The Indians have been traced. As to the prospect of ultimately capturing these last, I shall have a word {{to say to you}} on that head, when I reach the end of the <b>present</b> <b>Report.</b>|$|E

She was recommended to fill this situation by {{the keeper of the}} restaurant who has supplied the meals to the family throughout the period of their residence at the palace. Her character is most favourably spoken of. Unfortunately, her limited intelligence makes her of no value as a witness.

Gave it in, 27th September; by which time Heucking's also was in, and had made a strong impression on his Majesty. Presumably an honest, intelligible report; though, by ill-luck for the curious, it is now lost; among the barrow-loads of vague wigged stuff, this one Piece, probably human, is not to be discovered.|$|E

60|$|After that, I {{thought it}} best to get Mr. Yatman {{out of the house}} immediately. He was in such a pitiable {{condition}} that I called a cab and accompanied him home in it. At first he cried and raved like a child; but I soon quieted him; and I must add, to his credit, that he made me a most handsome apology for his language as the cab drew up at his house door. In return, I tried to give him some advice about how to set matters right for the future with his wife. He paid very little attention to me, and went upstairs muttering to himself about a separation. Whether Mrs. Yatman will come cleverly out of the scrape or not seems doubtful. I should say myself that she would go into screeching hysterics, and so frighten the poor man into forgiving her. But this is no business of ours. So far as we are concerned, the case is now at an end, and the <b>present</b> <b>report</b> may come to a conclusion along with it.|$|E
