5|$|High water {{remained}} in Salcha through the 31st, though {{the crest of}} the flooding had passed. Water continued to cover roads in and around Salcha, and water-borne debris accumulated under several local bridges, causing impromptu dams. By August 1, the Salcha River had begun to recede to a noticeable extent. Though some roads remained underwater and falling trees knocked out power to areas of the town, residents began to <b>pump</b> <b>out</b> basements and begin recovery efforts. By early afternoon on the first, the Old Richardson Highway had been cleared of water and the National Weather Service canceled its flood warning for the Salcha area.|$|E
5|$|The university, {{which is}} built on high ground, served as an {{evacuation}} point and emergency shelter for thousands of flood refugees. The civil defense director of the university expected between 700 and 800 people to take shelter at the university. Between 7,000 and 8,000 showed up as the water rose through August 14 and 15 and crammed into facilities designed to house just over 1,000 students. A helipad {{was set up in}} a parking lot, and helicopters from Eielson Air Force Base ferried supplies to the refugees. Fairbanks' power plant was flooded, so the university depended on its physical plant to provide electricity for the refugees. When the rising water threatened to flood the plant, hundreds of the refugees massed to build barricades and <b>pump</b> <b>out</b> the plant's basement.|$|E
5|$|When airways are damaged, air {{can escape}} {{from them and}} be trapped in the {{surrounding}} tissues in the neck (subcutaneous emphysema) and mediastinum (pneumomediastinum); if it builds up to high enough pressures there, it can compress the airways. Massive air leaks from a ruptured airway can also compromise the circulation by preventing blood from returning to the heart from the head and lower body; this causes a potentially deadly reduction {{in the amount of}} blood the heart is able to <b>pump</b> <b>out.</b> Blood and other fluids can build up in the airways, and the injury can interfere with the patency of the airway and interfere with its continuity. However, even if the trachea is completely transected, the tissues surrounding it may hold it together enough for adequate air exchange to occur, at least at first.|$|E

5|$|Governor Mike Easley {{declared}} a state of emergency in advance of the storm, and 200National Guard troops were dispatched to Charlotte, Raleigh, Kinston and Lumerton, while 800more were on standby. On Ocracoke Island, authorities ordered mandatory evacuations, while on Bogue Banks voluntary evacuations were in place. Officials in Wrightsville Beach drove along the streets with loudspeakers mounted on trucks, warning tourists that a storm was approaching. The storm forced the University of North Carolina at Wilmington to suspend a planned opening for students moving into residence halls. Campgrounds at the Cape Hatteras National Seashore were closed by the National Park Service and three boat ramps were closed. Duke Power Co. prepared for Charley by lowering the level of hydroelectric lakes to make room for excessive rainfall. The state Department of Environment and Natural Resources advised hog farmers to <b>pump</b> <b>out</b> their waste lagoon. About 60 Red Cross shelters were opened during the storm and during the peak of Charley, and roughly 1,600people sought protection.|$|E
25|$|The blood–brain barrier poses a {{difficult}} obstacle to pass to deliver chemotherapy to the brain. This {{is because the}} brain has an extensive system in place {{to protect it from}} harmful chemicals. Drug transporters can <b>pump</b> <b>out</b> drugs from the brain and brain's blood vessel cells into the cerebrospinal fluid and blood circulation. These transporters <b>pump</b> <b>out</b> most chemotherapy drugs, which reduces their efficacy for treatment of brain tumors. Only small lipophilic alkylating agents such as lomustine or temozolomide are able to cross this blood–brain barrier.|$|E

25|$|Currently {{the drain}} is so wide and deep that {{it acts as}} an {{elongated}} lake {{in its own right}} and can hold and store a lot of rain water which can be regulated through regulators built into it at intervals. Maintaining of proper water-level in the drain and storage of rainwater in it during the summer months leads to recharging of ground water table which the surrounding farmers find much helpful as they access the high water table though tube wells dug on their farmlands though which they <b>pump</b> <b>out</b> water to irrigate their crops, farmers owning farmlands bordering the drain in rural Delhi directly use pipes and hoses to <b>pump</b> <b>out</b> water from the drain for irrigation purposes.|$|E
25|$|During {{the declining}} years, freight boats were {{generally}} made in Cumberland. Freight boats {{in those years}} had two hulls, with 4 inches between them. There were holes (covered, when not in use) that one could put a pump in to <b>pump</b> <b>out</b> the bilge.|$|E

25|$|After three {{floods in}} the 1960s, Waterloo and Cedar Falls spent years {{building}} levees and flood gates along the Cedar River {{and two of}} its tributaries. During the flood of 2008, water became trapped behind those levees and was kept from returning to the river. The City of Waterloo is now investing in pump stations to <b>pump</b> <b>out</b> water from behind the dikes {{in the event of}} future flooding.|$|E
25|$|Somatic {{stem cells}} are {{naturally}} resistant to chemotherapeutic agents. They produce various pumps (such as MDR) that <b>pump</b> <b>out</b> drugs and DNA repair proteins. They have a slow rate of cell turnover (chemotherapeutic agents naturally target rapidly replicating cells). CSCs that develop from normal stem cells may also produce these proteins, which could increase their resistance towards chemotherapy. The surviving CSCs then repopulate the tumor, causing a relapse.|$|E
25|$|Barges {{were pulled}} by mules along the {{adjacent}} towpath, a power source employed {{even after the}} development of steam engines, since the bow wave from a faster steamboat would have damaged the channel. Children were often hired to lead the mules at first; in the canal's later years grown men were employed. They had to walk 15–20 miles (24–32km) a day, <b>pump</b> <b>out</b> the barges and tend the animals. For this they were paid about $3 a month.|$|E
50|$|A huge {{reservoir}} of ground water occurs below the entire lignite bed, exerting an upward pressure of 6 to 8 kg/cm2. Unless this water pressure is reduced before mining, it will burst the lignite seam and flood the Mines. This problem {{was overcome by}} continuously <b>pumping</b> <b>out</b> water round the clock through borewells located at predetermined points and thereby reducing the water pressure at the lignite excavation area. Over the years, through continuous study and implementation of new methods, the quantity of water <b>pumped</b> <b>out</b> has been reduced from 50,000 GPM to 32,000 GPM. (For mining one tonne of lignite, about 13 tonnes of water has to be <b>pumped</b> <b>out).</b> The water level is continuously monitored through observation wells for proper ground water management.|$|R

The samples were placed into a quartz tube which was evacuated at the definite temperature. Then, the samples have been put into the cavity of the spectrometer, and EPR spectrum was recorded without change of the <b>pumping</b> <b>out</b> conditions.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, leaking {{aviation}} gasoline accumulating {{in the forward}} elevator pit began vaporising and soon permeated {{the upper and lower}} hangar decks. The danger this posed to the ship was readily apparent to the damage control crews but, whether through inadequate training, lack of practice (only three months had passed since the ship's commissioning) or general incompetence, their response to it proved fatally ineffectual. Efforts to <b>pump</b> <b>out</b> the damaged elevator well were bungled and no one thought to try to cover the increasingly lethal mixture with foam from the hangar's fire suppression system.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, in Thailand's worst {{flooding}} {{for more}} than half-a-century, {{a great deal of}} Bangkok and its outskirts were inundated, including Patumthani, the area were Wat Phra Dhammakaya is located. Working together with the government, the temple deployed monastic and lay volunteers to bring a halt to the floods in the area, who had to work day and night to build walls using sandbags and <b>pump</b> <b>out</b> the water. At the same time, the temple offered shelter to evacuated workers from local factories, food, drinking water, transport and sandbags to local villagers, other affected temples and temples that also offered shelter.|$|E
25|$|Acute MI (as {{may occur}} {{due to the}} sudden rupture of a chorda tendinae or {{papillary}} muscle) causes a sudden volume overload of both the left atrium and the left ventricle. The left ventricle develops volume overload because with every contraction it now has to <b>pump</b> <b>out</b> not only the volume of blood {{that goes into the}} aorta (the forward cardiac output or forward stroke volume) but also the blood that regurgitates into the left atrium (the regurgitant volume). The combination of the forward stroke volume and the regurgitant volume is known as the total stroke volume of the left ventricle.|$|E

25|$|Almost {{all of the}} {{underground}} mines re-worked lodes {{that had already been}} mined from the surface. Because of the great quantity of underground water, it was necessary to dig horizontal adits into the hillsides to de-water the mines. Dartmoor's topography, cut with deep valleys, helped there and in many cases it was possible to dig to a reasonable depth without the need to <b>pump</b> <b>out</b> water. These adits connected with shafts that were either sunk vertically downwards or followed the line of the steeply dipping lode. Working the lode then took place by stoping from the horizontal levels in the usual manner.|$|E
25|$|Mining at Løkken Verk had {{its roots}} back to 1633 when King Christian IV of Denmark–Norway had opened the mine. At this time all mining was a {{privilege}} of the king. Later, in the 1800s, the mine was privatised and owned by Løkken Kobber og Kisværks Interessentskab. In 1868 the local farmer and sawmill owner Wilhelm A. Thams and his accountant Christian Salvesen from Leith, Scotland founded the mining company Ørkedals Mining Company and bought {{a number of small}} mines around Løkken. In the early 1880s Wilhelm's grandson, Christian Thams returned from Switzerland and took over the running of the mining company. He realized that to make money from mining, he had to purchase the largest mine of the all, but didn't succeed until 1896 when it no longer was feasible to manually <b>pump</b> <b>out</b> the water, and bought Løkken Mine.|$|E
500|$|The next day, as {{the seas}} {{battered}} {{the ship and}} drove her farther on the rocks, two Coast Guard boats took 31 men from the ship. American-Hawaiian announced that a Los Angeles salvage firm had been hired to retrieve the [...] cargo, which included explosives and oil. Two heavy-duty electric pumps were lowered to the ship via the breeches buoy, and plans were drawn up for connecting them to the San Francisco municipal electric system in order to <b>pump</b> <b>out</b> the ship.|$|E

While this statement is true, this demonstration actually illustrates a more subtle effect. This experiment was first devised during the middle of the seventeenth century to show that sound was a wave, not a transfer of "particles" from the source to the receiver.
