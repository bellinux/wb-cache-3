5|$|For many years, the United States {{produced}} more than 90% of commercially usable helium in the world, while extraction <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> Canada, Poland, Russia, and other nations produced the remainder.

Meanwhile, by 2000, the consumption of helium within the U.S. had risen to more than 15 million kg per year. In 2004â€“2006, additional <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> Ras Laffan, Qatar, and Skikda, Algeria were built. Algeria quickly became the second leading producer of helium.
