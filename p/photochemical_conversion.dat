40|$|The {{interest}} in microbial opsins stems from their photophysical properties, which {{are superior to}} most organic dyes. Microbial rhodopsins like bacteriorhodopsin (BR) from Halobacterium salinarum have an astonishingly high cross-section for two-photon-absorption (TPA), which is of great interest for technological applications such as data storage. Irradiation of BR with intense laser pulses at 532 nm leads to formation of a bathochromic photoproduct, which is further converted to a photochemical species absorbing in the UV range. As demonstrated earlier, the <b>photochemical</b> <b>conversions</b> are induced by resonant TPA. However, the molecular basis of these conversions remained unresolved. In this work we use mass spectroscopy to demonstrate that TPA of BR leads to selective decarboxylation of two aspartic acids {{in the vicinity of}} the retinal chromphore. These <b>photochemical</b> <b>conversions</b> are the basis of permanent two-photon data storage in BR and are of critical importance for application of microbial opsins in optogenetics...|$|R

50|$|Another {{application}} of the photoacoustic effect {{is its ability to}} estimate the chemical energies stored in various steps of a photochemical reaction. Following light absorption photophysical and <b>photochemical</b> <b>conversions</b> occur, which store part of the light energy as chemical energy. Energy storage leads to less heat evolution. The resulting smaller photoacoustic signal thus gives a quantitative estimate of the extent of the energy storage. For transient species this requires the measurement of the signal in the relevant time scale and the capability to extract from the temporal part of the signal the time-dependent heat evolution, by proper deconvolution. There are numerous examples for this application. A similar application is the study of the conversion of light energy to electrical energy in solar cells. A special example is the {{application of}} the photoacoustic effect in photosynthesis research.|$|R
