Since its inception, UMSFP has remained an entirely student-driven initiative. A leadership team of four graduate students and four undergraduate students is responsible for program oversight and makes all of the core decisions surrounding its administration. In January 2013, UMSFP Program Manager, Emily Canosa, was hired to provide mentorship and support to the student leaders and to aid in the continuity to the program, as student leadership turns over each year. Emily is the only non-student member involved in the UMSFP leadership meetings. UMSFP also has an advisory board comprised of the students on the UMSFP leadership team, faculty, and staff. The program has since blossomed into a community of 10 active member groups, each representing unique interests in sustainable food. One of these member groups, Friends of the Campus Farm, along with student interns hired by the Matthaei Botanical Gardens, are responsible for directing and managing the Campus Farm, located at the Matthaei Botanical Gardens. The Farm began as a pilot program in May 2012, and it grew to its full production space of two acres, with a quarter acre cultivated, in Summer 2013. The Campus Farm was founded with this threefold mission (Dengate et. al, 2013) : 1. Develop responsible citizens and leaders by facilitating formal and informal education on sustainable food topics. 2. Strengthen communities through collaborative programming and outreach 3. Grow sustainable food that supports the well-being of people and the environmental at the University of Michigan and beyond In line with this mission, programming at the farm has flourished since the planting of the <b>pilot</b> <b>plot</b> in May 2012 : • Students can buy produce on campus in the fall at MFarmers’ Markets and at UMSFP’s member group Student Food Co. ’s bi-weekly produce table • University courses incorporate the farm into their curriculum and projects, racking up more than 600 hours of course contact annually • Friends of the Campus Farm schedules regular workdays and volunteer opportunities for upwards of forty loyal volunteers who donate over 1900 hours of their time to the Farm each year. • New students get acquainted with the farm during Welcome Week and orientations • Three hundred community members celebrate each year at the Harvest Festiva...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Better use {{of water}} and soil {{resources}} in paddy fields, increase in rice production and farmer's income, installation of subsurface drainage system is necessary. The main goalof these systems, are aeration conditions improvement prevention of water logging, yield increase, land use increase and multiuse of the land. In different countries, installation of subsurface drainage cause yield increase and working condition on the land, but no {{research has been conducted}} in different depths and spacing. On the other hand, spacing and depth are the most important parameters in the installation of drainage systems, have a direct effect on incoming water into the drains. The aim of this research, is an investigation of the effect of subsurface drainage with different depths and spacing on discharge rate variation and water table fall, in order to analyze the improvement of water flow movement in the soil. Also, study the effect of different drainage systems on the increase of the canola yield as the second cultivation in these treatments have been compared. Materials and Methods: To measure hydraulic conductivity in different depths, the auger holes have been dug (excavated). The saturated hydraulic conductivity in these holes wasdetermined using Ernst method (1950) before installation of drainage systems. In the drainage <b>pilot</b> <b>plot</b> of Sari Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources University three subsurface drainage systems with mineral envelope have been installed. 1 - The first one with the 0. 9 m depth and 30 m spacing (D 90 L 30), 2 - The second one with 0. 65 m depth and 15 m spacing (D 0. 65 L 15) and 3 - The third one with 0. 65 m depth and spacing (D 0. 65 L 30) and one bi-level system with mineral envelope including four drains of 15 m spacing with 0. 9 m and 0. 65 m depths were installed alternatively. After auger hole equipment installations, in the middle spacing of two subsurface and water table reading possible, the water table fluctuation and drain outlet discharge rate from farm drains during canola growing season were measured on a daily basis. Also, canola yield during 4 years after drainage systems were monitored. Results and Discution: The results showed that mean discharge rates of drainage systems have increased with time and in the fourth year it was better than first and second years. Duringthe second year, the highest discharge rate onthe first day was in the low depth treatment and after 3 days the discharge rates become the difference among less. In the third year, the discharge rates of high spacing drains (D 0. 65 L 30) have become higher than of spacing drains (D 0. 65 L 15) discharge rates. But, in the first day its discharge rate was less and one can conclude that it is due to horizontal flow. With passing time and soil structure improvement, one can observe better yield from drains with higher spacing (30 m) also. By performance of drainage and soil conditions improvement in the third and fourth year, the deeper drainage systems have becomes better and water table fall of deep drain discharge rate and soil condition improvement in these systems become higher. In bi-level drainage, by increasing deep percolation, the water table fall in this treatment increased with time. Also, based on monitoring water table, in the first and second years after 5 th day and in the third and fourth years after 4 th day the water tables of deep drains decreased to lower depth drains. Due to heavy soil in paddy fields and existence of hardpan, the performance of low depth drains in falling water table was better in the first years. With passing time and performance of drainage the conditions for water movement in the soil become better and performance of deep drainage systems improved and at the fourth year, deep drainage systems had better performance in draining water with respect to low depth drainage systems. Also, canola yield as second cultivation, has increased from first to fourth year and along with important of soil aeration conditions and performance of drainage systems, the grain yield hasincreased in different drainage treatments. The results showed a direct relationship between improvement of system performance and increase in grain yield. In the second year, grain yield increased in all treatments. On the other hand, the yield under drainage systems with deeper depth (D 0. 9 L 30) even higher in the 2 nd and 4 th years than with low depth drain (D 0. 65 L 30). This was because of more fall in water table levels during days after rainfall and also with next rainfall, saturation of soil up to surface layer in the plots with deeper drains were performed later and it may not reach up to thesoil surface. Conclusion: Due to betterconditions of deep drains and with higher spacing in the improvement of paddy field use and also less environmental harm use of drains with higher spacing are recommended for these lands. On the other hand,a low increase in drain depth from 0. 65 m to 0. 9 m along with increase in spacing of 30 m with respect to 15 m and even with 0. 65 m depth, will have less cost. Due to decrease in the costs of drain installation with higher spacing, due to improvement of conditions, the performance of these systems in 2 to 3 years one can have cheaper drainage systems in the longest time and will improve the economic situation of farmers due to higher yield...|$|E

40|$|The {{leaching}} of Sb from waste-to-energy (WtE) {{bottom ash}} (BA) often exceeds the Dutch limit value of 0. 32 mgkg(- 1) for recycling of BA in open construction applications. From the immobilization mechanisms {{described in the}} literature, it could be concluded that both Ca and Fe {{play an important role}} in the immobilization of Sb in WtE BA. Therefore, Ca and Fe containing compounds were added to the samples of the sand fraction of WtE BA, which in contrast to the granulate fraction is not recyclable to date, and the effect on the Sb leaching was studied by means of batch leaching tests. Results showed that addition of 0. 5 and 2. 5 % CaO, 5 % CaCl 2, 2. 5 % Fe 2 (SO 4) 3 and 1 % FeCl 3 decreased the Sb leaching from 0. 62 ± 0. 02 mgkgDM(- 1) to 0. 20 ± 0. 02, 0. 083 ± 0. 044, 0. 25 ± 0. 01, 0. 27 ± 0. 002 and 0. 29 ± 0. 02 mgkgDM(- 1), respectively. Due to the increase in pH from 11. 41 to 12. 53 when 2. 5 % CaO was added, Pb and Zn leaching increased and exceeded the respective leaching limits. Addition of 5 % CaCO 3 had almost no effect on the Sb leaching, as evidenced by the resulting 0. 53 mgkgDM(- 1) leaching concentration. This paper shows a complementary enhancement of the effect of Ca and Fe, by comparing the aforementioned Sb leaching results with those of WtE BA with combined addition of 2. 5 % CaO or 5 % CaCl 2 with 2. 5 % Fe 2 (SO 4) 3 or 1 % FeCl 3. These lab scale results suggest that formation of romeites with a high Ca content and formation of iron antimonate (tripuhyite) with a very low solubility are the main immobilization mechanisms of Sb in WtE BA. Besides the pure compounds and their mixtures, also addition of 10 % of two Ca and Fe containing residues of the steel industry, hereafter referred to as R 1 and R 2, was effective in decreasing the Sb leaching from WtE BA below the Dutch limit value for reuse in open construction applications. To evaluate the long term effect of the additives, <b>pilot</b> <b>plots</b> of WtE BA with 10 % of R 1 and 5 % and 10 % of R 2 were built and samples were submitted to leaching tests at regular intervals over time.

The Sb leaching from the <b>pilot</b> <b>plots</b> of BA with additives first remained stable around 0. 13 mgkg(- 1) but had a tendency to slightly increase after 6 months, indicating the need for further research on the effect of weathering, and more specifically of carbonation, on Sb leaching from WtE BA. status: publishe...|$|R

The crop-soil simulation model STICS coupled with a geographic information system was used to estimate the amount of NO 3 – leaching and to assess the ability of alternative management practices to reduce NO 3 – leaching in a nitrate vulnerable zone (NVZ) in La Rioja, Spain. Model performance was examined by comparing the simulations and measurements of irrigated grapevine crops (variety Tempranillo) over various soil types. The measurements were obtained from five <b>pilot</b> <b>plots</b> {{over a period of}} three years and included the mineral nitrogen, the water content of the soil profiles and the nitrogen content of the crops.

The simulations identified good {{agricultural practices}} (GAP) for mitigating NO 3 – pollution. High soil mineral nitrogen (SMN) and water pollution were driven by both the NO 3 – concentration of irrigation water and the level of organic manure application. The use of aquifer water for irrigation would lead to diminish aquifer pollution at the expense of maintaining high SMN, non desirable for grape quality production.

The bambara groundnut, {{a relative of}} the cowpea, is a protein-rich crop valued for its drought tolerance and low demand on soil properties. The nut is used for home consumption and is sold on local markets. The crop's foliage is used as fodder for livestock. Nevertheless, very {{little research has been}} done for raising yields or making the crop commercially more interesting. Ramolemana discovered that phosphorous fertilisers, irrigation, and higher plant density can increase yields. He found that the addition of moisture enhances intake of phosphorus, the scarcest nutrient in Botswanan soils. The nutrient is most needed for growth during the first two weeks after sowing. So applying moisture during this critical period makes a lot of difference. Farmers usually obtain yields of about 500 kg/ha, but Ramolemana's irrigated <b>pilot</b> <b>plots</b> yielded over 4 t/ha. Even his rainfed plots produced almost 3 t/ha after adding phosphorus and increasing plant density. 'You should avoid too many plants. We are still looking for the optimum', says Ramolemana.

ABSTRACT: Ginger, or Zingiber officinale Roscoe in Latin, is a plant with high medicinal and commercial values. Most of high quality gingers are conventionally grown in mountain slopes such as in Janda Baik and Bukit Tinggi, Bentong, Pahang. Second phase planting on the same land can only be done after the land has been left (without any commercial crop) for at least 6 years. Thus, nomadic cultivation is still practised due to the soil-borne diseases such as bacterial wilt and fusarium wilt that attack ginger rhizomes, which results in yield decline. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate {{the costs and benefits of}} ginger cultivation using fertigation with conventional methods for the production of mature and young ginger. Data were obtained from <b>pilot</b> project <b>plot</b> under MARDI and Department of Agriculture. Cost-benefit analysis showed that the costs of production for mature and young ginger using fertigation system were RM 0. 90 /kg and RM 1. 41 /kg, respectively, compared to RM 1. 36 /kg and RM 1. 24 /kg using conventional method, respectively. Annual net income for mature (RM 174, 680 / ha) and young (RM 32, 500 / ha) ginger production using fertigation system was higher than the conventional method (mature ginger: RM 49, 200 and young ginger: RM 21, 100). The higher net income was due to the high yield of ginger, two to threefold pe...|$|R
40|$|Widespread {{contamination}} of groundwater by MTBE has triggered {{the exploration of}} different technologies for in situ removal of the pollutant. After laboratory studies revealed that bacterial strain PMl is capable of rapid and complete MTBE biodegradation, the organism was tested in an in-situ bioaugmentation field study at Port Hueneme Naval Base, Oxnard, CA. Two small <b>pilot</b> test <b>plots</b> (A and B) located down gradient from an MTBE source were injected with pure oxygen at two depths. One plot (B) was also inoculated with Strain PMl. MTBE concentrations upstream from plots A and B initially varied temporally from 1. 5 to 6 mg per L. By six months after treatment began, MTBE concentrations wells downstream from the injection bed substantially decreased in the shallow zone of the groundwater in both plots, {{even in the absence}} of Strain PM 1. In the deeper zone, downstream MTBE concentrations also decreased substantially in Plot A and to lesser extent in Plot B. Difficulties in delivery of oxygen to the deep zone of Plot B, evidenced by low dissolved oxygen concentrations, are likely responsible for low rates of MTBE removal at that location. We measured the survival and movement of PMl in groundwater using three different methods for detection of PMl rDNA sequences: TaqMan quantitative peR, Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE), and Intergenic Spacer Region (ITS) analysis. A naturally occurring organism with > 99 % rDNA sequence similarity to Strain PMl was detected in groundwater collected outside the test plots. Changes in the groundwater microbial community were also monitored over time using ITS, a PCR-based DNA fingerprinting method. The largest differences in the microbial community profiles were observed between the shallow and deep groundwater samples, regardless of whether they were from plot A or B...|$|R
