25|$|Due to its {{embarrassing}} {{nature and}} the shame felt by sufferers, the subject was taboo for a long time, and {{is the subject of}} many urban legends. Folk remedies have long been advocated, with some being advertised widely since the 1930s. The introduction of perhaps the first <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> remedy for impotence, sildenafil (trade name Viagra), in the 1990s caused a wave of public attention, propelled in part by the news-worthiness of stories about it and heavy advertising.|$|R

While there was research into the use of hormonal contraception for wildlife control as early as the 1950s that produced <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> products, they all proved to be ineffective for wildlife control for a variety of practical reasons. Field trials of immunocontraception in wildlife, on the other hand, established that contraceptive vaccines could be delivered remotely by capture gun, were safe to use in pregnant animals, were reversible, and induced long-lasting infertility, overcoming these practical limitations.|$|R
30|$|Several {{therapeutic}} anticancer drugs, although <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> {{in cancer}} treatment, are restricted in their clinical applications {{because of their}} severe toxicity[1]. The severe toxicity is usually due to the lipid solubility {{of most of the}} anticancer drugs (> 70 %) and the therapeutic doses that are often very high[2]. Doxorubicin {{is one of the most}} successful drugs for targeting a broad range of cancers. Nevertheless, its clinical use is hindered by its side effects, which include cardiotoxicity and acquired drug resistance. To overcome these complications, researchers have placed an emphasis on developing nanoscale anticancer drug carriers for improving therapeutic efficacy in addition to reducing unwanted side effects[3].|$|R

40|$|International audienceGamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) {{is a major}} {{inhibitory}} neurotransmitter physiologically active in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), being synthesised and delivered by GABAergic neurons. It is, however, pharmacologically devoid of CNS activity when presented externally to brain because of limited blood-brain barrier diffusion and intensive breakdown by astrocyte GABA transaminase. We show herein that extracerebral administration may be, however, <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> in controlling experimental convulsive attacks when GABA is submitted to sublimation under vacuum just before use.

40|$|Few {{published}} {{human data}} are available concerning the acute toxicity of the new antiepileptic drug oxcarbazepine of which the metabolite 10 - monohydroxy derivate (MHD) is the <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> compound. Two hours after a documented overdosage of more than 100 tablets oxcarbazepine, the serum level of the parent compound was 10 -fold higher than the therapeutic dosage (31. 6 mg l− 1). However, the concentration of MHD, which peaked 7 h after intake, was only twofold higher (59. 0 mg l− 1). No life-threatening situations occurred and the patient fully recovered. The fact that oxcarbazepine is a prodrug and that {{the formation of the}} active MHD metabolite is a rate-limiting process may contribute to the relative low toxicity of the drug in overdose...|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} of growing human leukaemic cells in diffusion chambers {{was developed to}} enable chemicals to be assessed {{for their ability to}} induce terminal differentiation. HL- 60 promyelocytic leukaemia cell growth, in a lucite chamber with a Millipore filter, was optimised by use of a lateral incision site. Chambers were constructed using 0. 45 um filters and contained 150 ul of serum-free HL- 60 cells at a density of 1 x 106 cells/ml. The chambers were implanted into CBA/Ca mice and spontaneous terminal differentiation of the cells to granulocytes was prevented by the use of serum-free medium. Under these conditions there was an initial growth lag of 72 hours and a logarithmic phase of growth for 96 hours; the cell number reached a plateau after 168 hours of culture in vivo. The amount of drug in the plasma of the animal and in chambers that had been implanted for 5 days, was determined after a single ip injection of equitoxic doses of N-methylformamide, N-ethylformamide, tetramethylurea, N-dibutylformamide, N-tetramethylbutylformamide and hexamethylenebisacetamide. Concentrations of both TMU and HMBA were obtained in the plasma and in the chamber which were <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> for the induction of differentiation of HL- 60 cells in vitro, that is 12 mM TMU and 5 mM HMBA. A 4 day regime of treatment of animals implanted with chambers demonstrated that TMU and HMBA induced terminal differentiation of 50 % and 35 %, respectively, of the implanted HL- 60 cells to granulocyte-like cells, assessed by measurement of functional and biochemical markers of maturity.

40|$|The {{ability of}} an {{anticonvulsant}} dose (0. 1 mg/kg i. p.) of imidazenil, a new partial agonist of benzodiazepine receptors, to antagonize the convulsions {{and the increase}} in t-[35 S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35 S]TBPS) binding to the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor elicited by isoniazid, an inhibitor of central GABAergic function, was evaluated in mice chronically treated (3 times daily for 30 days) with the same dose of imidazenil. The challenge dose of imidazenil, administered 36 h after the last injection of the chronic treatment protocol, reduced both isoniazid-induced convulsions and the isoniazid-induced increase in [35 S]TBPS binding to the same marked extent as in control mice. These results indicate that long-term treatment with a <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> dose of imidazenil failed to induce tolerance to both the anticonvulsant effect and the positive modulatory action on GABAA receptor function of this drug in mouse brain...|$|R

40|$|The Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) classifies {{pharmaceutical}} compounds {{based on}} their aqueous solubility and intestinal permeability. The BCS Class III compounds are hydrophilic molecules (high aqueous solubility) with low permeability across the biological membranes. While these compounds are <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective,</b> poor absorption due to low permeability becomes the rate-limiting step in achieving adequate bioavailability. Several approaches have been explored and utilized for improving the permeability profiles of these compounds. The approaches include traditional methods such as prodrugs, permeation enhancers, ion-pairing, etc., as well as relatively modern approaches such as nanoencapsulation and nanosizing. The most recent approaches include a combination/hybridization {{of one or more}} traditional approaches to improve drug permeability. While some of these approaches have been extremely successful, i. e. drug products utilizing the approach have progressed through the USFDA approval for marketing; others require further investigation to be applicable.

40|$|Abstract Background Panax notoginseng is an {{important}} Chinese medicinal plant. Dammarene-type triterpenoid saponins are main <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> compounds in P. notoginseng. This study aims to investigate the formation and accumulation of saponins in P. notoginseng roots during germination and juvenile stage. Methods P. notoginseng seeds were collected and stored in wet sand. After germination, the seedlings were transplanted into a soil nursery bed and cultivated for one year. During this period, samples were collected every month and the concentrations of ginsengnosides Rg 1, Re, Rb 1, Rd and notoginsengnoside R 1 were determined by HPLC. Results There was little saponin in the P. notoginseng seed. The chemical composition of seed was {{different from that of}} root. After germination, Rb 1, Rg 1, Re, Rd and R 1 appeared successively in the seedling root. And in the five-month-old root, all these five main saponins came into existence. The accumulation of saponins in P. notoginseng root was affected by seasons. Conclusion The accumulation of saponins showed a time-dependent increase after germination of P. notoginseng. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{biological}} {{specificity of}} the endotoxin receptor on platelet membranes was examined. The binding indices of platelets in experimental endotoxemia which was induced by intravenous administration of endotoxin (Lipopolysaccharide of E. coli, Difco) to rabbits {{were found to}} be 30 % of the control at 60 min after the injection. The result suggests that the endotoxin receptor of platelets was already occupied. The binding indices of human platelets were measured after pretreatment with pharmacologically active substances which were assumed to effect platelet activity. The binding of LPS to platelets showed competitive inhibition at <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> doses, but other substances merely inhibited platelet activity. One interpretation {{is that there is a}} common receptor on platelet cell membranes for lipopolysaccharide of E. coli and endotoxin. The sensitivity to endotoxin in vivo and binding indices of platelets were examined in rabbits and guinea pigs since their response to endotoxin is almost opposite with regard to sensitivity. The binding indices of platelets from rabbits and guinea pigs showed a positive correlation with the endotoxin sensitivity. Those findings indicate that platelets play a key role in vivo in the clinical course of endotoxemia. </p...|$|R
40|$|The in vivo {{inhibitory}} effect of r-hirudin variant III (rHV 3) on streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic cataracts in rats was investigated. SD-rats were firstly made diabetic {{by a single}} intraperitoneal injection of 2 % (W/V) STZ (65 [*]mg/kg). Two weeks later, cataract formation was examined by slit lamp microscope, and the cataracted animals were randomly grouped. The animals in the treated groups received rHV 3 drops administration to the eyes with various doses. After 4 weeks treatment, the animals were sacrificed to evaluate the biochemical changes of aldose reductase (AR), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the eye lens. Meanwhile, the cataract progression was monitored by slit lamp microscope. As a result, rHV 3 drops treatment significantly increased the activities of SOD and GSH-Px in the lens in a dose-dependent manner, whereas AR activity and MDA level in the lens were dramatically decreased. Also, the morphological observation further confirmed the inhibition {{of the development of}} STZ-induced diabetic cataracts by the rHV 3 drops treatment. Thus, our data suggest that rHV 3 drops are <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> for the protection against STZ-induced diabetic cataracts in rats...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess whether}} topical {{morphine}} is <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> in relieving pain from ulcers caused by arterial insufficiency and identify whether {{this effect is}} centrally or peripherally mediated. METHOD: The analgesic effect of a topically applied hydrogel containing 0. 5 % of morphine was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover pilot study involving nine patients with painful arterial leg ulcers. All patients had a baseline pain intensity of at least 5 on a 10 -point numeric rating scale. They received the following three treatments in random order: morphine hydrogel plus a subcutaneous (SC) placebo infusion; placebo gel plus a SC infusion of 5 mg morphine over six hours and a placebo gel plus a SC placebo infusion. Each treatment lasted one day. Pain was assessed during the first 24 hours after application of the hydrogel {{and the start of}} the subcutaneous infusion. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between average baseline pain scores and those reported during treatment, but this difference was not clinically relevant. The three treatments did not differ in terms of the pain relief provided. CONCLUSION: Topical morphine does not have a clinically relevant analgesic effect in patients with painful arterial leg ulcers. Further research should focus on ulcers of other aetiolog...|$|R
40|$|Niklas Schuelert, Fiona A Russell, Jason J McDougallDepartment of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, CanadaAbstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{a common}} disease that affects {{millions}} of people worldwide. As {{there is no cure}} for OA, drug treatment to relieve symptoms is the main form of management. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac are the most commonly used drugs to treat knee OA pain. Unfortunately, these agents are associated with gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks, which limit their chronic use. Topical NSAIDs are emerging as a viable alternative for managing OA pain. Because a <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> dose can be restricted to the site of pain, there is superfluous systemic absorption, and the risk of related adverse effects is minimized. This article reviews the currently available preclinical and clinical information on topical diclofenac for the treatment of OA pain, including data from recently published randomized controlled trials regarding the efficacy and safety of topical diclofenac. Most studies confirm topical diclofenac to be as effective as oral diclofenac with significantly reduced side effects; however, the efficacy of NSAIDs is far from optimal, and more research {{needs to be done to}} investigate the underlying mechanisms of OA in order to improve treatment options, especially for patients with NSAID-resistant OA pain.

40|$|Adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL) is {{a lethal}} {{neoplasia}} derived from HTLV- 1 -infected T lymphocytes frequently exhibiting nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation. Despite {{the use of}} various treatment regimens, the prognosis of ATL is poor, and new treatment strategies are urgently needed. We therefore explored the effect and the molecular mechanism of a proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, in ATL cells. We found bortezomib-induced cell death, and bortezomib suppressed constitutive NF-κB activation via I-κB stabilisation in three ATL cell lines (TaY, MT- 2 and MT- 4). An oligonucleotide DNA microarray analysis of TaY cells revealed upregulation of genes encoding heat shock proteins (HSPA 1 A, STIP 1, HSPA 1 B, and HSPCA), genes related to protein folding (CDC 37 and ANAPC 5), Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF 1) and an oxidative stress-related gene, heme oxygenase- 1 (HMOX- 1), {{known to be a}} target gene of hypoxia-inducible gene- 1 alpha (HIF- 1 alpha). Cobalt protoporphyrin induced HMOX- 1, instead of HIF- 1 alpha expression and increased bortezomib-induced apoptosis in the presence of <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> doses of bortezomib. In contrast, zinc protoporphyrin downregulated HMOX- 1 expression, thereby partially inhibiting bortezomib-induced cell death. This indicates that HMOX- 1 may modulate anticancer effects of bortezomib in ATL cells, and could be a molecular target in treating ATL patients...|$|R

The main aim of my research work was, therefore, to test the potential hepatoprotective effect of selected cytoprotective drugs and try to find out or suggest their mechanism of action, which we have examined in the systems for the intracellular gaseous signaling molecules NO and CO, where the key enzymes for their formation are NOS / HO respectively. My PhD study had two main directions: 1) Experimental study of the relationship between HO / CO and NOS / NO systems in the environment of hepatotoxic substances on isolated primary rat hepatocytes and in rat model, 2) Evaluation of ameliorative effect of selected substances in the hepatotoxicity models and to test the relationship of this effect on changes in some parameters of cytotoxicity / cytoprotection, antioxidant parameters, gene expression of mRNA for selected genes and histological changes in the state of cells / tissues / organs.

Clinical use of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 has been limited by hypercalcemia elicited by <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> doses. We hypothesized that structurally distinct, nonsecosteroidal mimics of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 might have different activity profiles from vitamin D analogs, and set out to discover such compounds by screening small-molecule libraries. Results:A bis-phenyl derivative was found to activate VDR in a transactivationscreening assay. Additional related compounds were synthesized that mimicked various activities of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3, including growth inhibition of cancer cells and keratinocytes, as well as induction of leukemic cell differentiation. In contrast to 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3, these synthetic compounds did not demonstrate appreciable binding to serum vitamin D binding protein, a property that is correlated with fewer calcium effects in vivo. Two mimics tested in mice showed greater induction of a VDR target gene with less elevation of serum calcium than 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3. Conclusions:These novel VDR modulators may have potential as therapeutics for cancer, leukemia and psoriasis with less calcium mobilization side effects than are associated with secosteroidal 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 analogs...|$|R

40|$|Brain injury {{continues}} {{to be one of}} the leading causes of disability worldwide. Despite decades of research, there is currently no <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> treatment for preventing neuronal loss and repairing the brain. As a result, novel therapeutic approaches, such as cell-based therapies, are being actively pursued to repair tissue damage and restore neurological function after injury. In this study, we examined the neuroprotective potential of amniotic fluid (AF) single cell clones, engineered to secrete glial cell derived neurotrophic factor (AF-GDNF), both in vitro and in a surgically induced model of brain injury. Our results show that pre-treatment with GDNF significantly increases cell survival in cultures of AF cells or cortical neurons exposed to hydrogen peroxide. Since improving the efficacy of cell transplantation depends on enhanced graft cell survival, we investigated whether AF-GDNF cells seeded on polyglycolic acid (PGA) scaffolds could enhance graft survival following implantation into the lesion cavity. Encouragingly, the AF-GDNF cells survived longer than control AF cells in serum-free conditions and continued to secrete GDNF both in vitro and following implantation into the injured motor cortex. AF-GDNF implantation in the acute period following injury was sufficient to activate the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in host neural cells in the peri-lesion area, potentially boosting endogenous neuroprotective pathways. These results were complemented with promising trends in beam walk tasks in AF-GDNF/PGA animals during the 7 day timeframe. Further investigation is required to determine whether significant behavioural improvement can be achieved at a longer timeframe. 9 2014 Crown Copyright as represented by: Danica Stanimirovic.

40|$|The anticancer {{activity}} of calcium chloride was evaluated {{from the total}} count and viability of Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) cells and their proteins, nucleic acid, malondialdehyde (MDA) and Nonprotein sulfhydryl (NP-SH) groups in addition to observations on survival and the body weight changes. The tumors at site of injection were investigated for histopathological changes. The treatment with calcium chloride (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day) caused cytotoxic activity. These data are substantiated by biochemical and histopathological changes and are attributed to calcium ions, which are known to disrupt calcium homeostasis, produce ROS, damage mitochondria and cause DNA breaks. Nevertheless, these data were not {{in agreement with the}} results on survival and body weight of the same animals. Treatment at the higher doses of calcium chloride increased the body weight and restricted the life span much earlier than the lower dose of calcium chloride and ADM. The discrepancy between these results might be due to the difference in the time of observation. While the experiments on cytotoxic activity, biochemical investigation and histopathology were conducted 10 and 5 days after the implantation of EAC cells and treatment, respectively, the observations on body weight and mortality were continued until death of all the animals or up to a maximum of 50 days. Data obtained in the present study demonstrate that treatment of calcium chloride at the higher doses had no influence on body weight and cause mortality as a long term effect, which might be due to co-morbidity of several diseases, caused by hypercalcemia and impairment of mitochondria. Further experiments are warranted on the use of a sufficient number of lower doses of calcium chloride to determine a <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> and non-toxic dose...|$|R

Maximum quantities and/or maximum levels which may not be exceeded have been established in many cases for residues of <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> substances and environmental contaminants, such as heavy metals and dioxins, in foods of animal origin. The goal of food monitoring within the scope of the NRCP and ICP is to check for compliance with these maximum quantities and levels, to disclose the illegal use of prohibited or unauthorised substances and to identify the causes of increased levels of residues and contaminants.

Objective: We tested the safety, tolerability, and pharmacologic and biological efficacy of a tachykinin NK(1) /NK(2) receptor antagonist, AVE 5883, in patients with asthma in two double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies. METHODS: The pharmacologic efficacy of a single inhaled dose (4. 8 mg) of AVE 5883 was tested against inhaled NKA in 20 patients with asthma. Subsequently, we studied the biological efficacy of the <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> dose on inhaled allergen in a multiple-dose trial (4. 8 mg three times per day, 9 d) in 12 patients with asthma with dual responses to inhaled house dust mite. On Day 8, an allergen challenge was conducted, and airway response was measured by FEV(1) until 9 hours postallergen. Exhaled NO, provocative concentration of methacholine bromide causing a 20 % fall in FEV(1), and induced sputum were performed on Days 1, 7, and 9. RESULTS: AVE 5883 had a bad taste, and transient bronchospasm occurred in some subjects. A single inhaled dose shifted the dose response to NKA by 1. 2 doubling doses. Pretreatment with multiple doses of AVE 5883 enhanced the allergen-induced early and late airway responses. There {{were no significant differences}} in the allergen-induced changes in exhaled NO, provocative concentration of methacholine bromide causing a 20 % fall in FEV(1), and sputum cell differentials between placebo and AVE 5883. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its demonstrated pharmacologic activity against inhaled NKA, multiple doses of AVE 5883 increased the allergen-induced airway responses without affecting markers of airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation.

In an unblinded, escalating dose protocol, {{the effects of}} heparin (group I, n = 8), and of 50 mg (group II, n = 3), 150 mg (group III, n = 3), 300 mg (group IV, n = 8), or 450 mg (group V, n = 3) of ridogrel, given as an intravenous bolus, each in combination with an infusion of 100 mg alteplase over 3 hours, were studied. Administration of ridogral and alteplase {{was not associated with}} major bleeding, although template bleeding times greater than 9 minutes were measured in nine patients. Coronary angiography, after 5 to 10 days, revealed a patent infarct-related vessel in all of 14 ridogrel-treated patients and in two of three control patients. The capacity of whole blood to generate thromboxane B 2 decreased to 1 % and 3 %, respectively, of baseline (P < 0. 001) at 45 minutes and 12 to 24 hours after administration of ridogrel (50 to 450 mg); it increased three-fold for 6 -keto-prostaglandin F 1 -alpha and prostaglandin F 2 -alpha and 25 -fold for prostaglandin E 2 (P < 0. 001). This is indicative of a protracted inhibition of thromboxane A 2 synthase accompanied by a reorientation of prostaglandin endoperoxide metabolism toward platelet inhibitory prostanoids. In patients given 150 to 450 mg ridogrel, eight-fold more (4 -mu-M) U 46619 was required for 50 % of maximal platelet aggregation, indicative for thromboxane A 2 -prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonism. Thus, ridogrel is sufficiently safe and <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> to warrant further clinical investigation of its potential as an adjuvant treatment to alteplase in patients with acute myocardial infarction. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Targeted {{delivery}} of pharmaceutical agents into selected populations of CNS (Central Nervous System) neurons {{is an extremely}} compelling goal. Currently, systemic methods are generally used for {{delivery of}} pain medications, anti-virals for treatment of dermatomal infections, anti-spasmodics, and neuroprotectants. Systemic side effects or undesirable effects on parts of the CNS that {{are not involved in}} the pathology limit efficacy and limit clinical utility for many classes of pharmaceuticals. Axonal transport from the periphery offers a possible selective route, but there has been little progress towards design of agents that can accomplish targeted delivery via this intraneural route. To achieve this goal, we developed a tripartite molecular construction concept involving an axonal transport facilitator molecule, a polymer linker, and a large number of drug molecules conjugated to the linker, then sought to evaluate its neurobiology and pharmacological behavior. Results We developed chemical synthesis methodologies for assembling these tripartite complexes using a variety of axonal transport facilitators including nerve growth factor, wheat germ agglutinin, and synthetic facilitators derived from phage display work. Loading of up to 100 drug molecules per complex was achieved. Conjugation methods were used that allowed the drugs to be released in active form inside the cell body after transport. Intramuscular and intradermal injection proved <b>effective</b> for introducing <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> doses into selected populations of CNS neurons. Pharmacological efficacy with gabapentin in a paw withdrawal latency model revealed a ten fold increase in half life and a 300 fold decrease in necessary dose relative to systemic administration for gabapentin when the drug was delivered by axonal transport using the tripartite vehicle. Conclusion Specific targeting of selected subpopulations of CNS neurons for drug delivery by axonal transport holds great promise. The data shown here provide a basic framework for the intraneural pharmacology of this tripartite complex. The pharmacologically efficacious drug delivery demonstrated here verify the fundamental feasibility of using axonal transport for targeted drug delivery. </p...|$|R
40|$|Inflammatory cytokines are key {{drivers of}} {{cartilage}} degradation in post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Cartilage degradation mediated by these inflammatory cytokines {{has been extensively}} investigated using in vitro experimental systems. Based on one such study, we have developed a computational model to quantitatively {{assess the impact of}} charged small molecules intended to inhibit IL- 1 mediated cartilage degradation. We primarily focus on the simplest possible computational model of small molecular interaction with the IL- 1 system—direct binding of the small molecule to the active site on the IL- 1 molecule itself. We first use the model to explore the uptake and release kinetics of the small molecule inhibitor by cartilage tissue. Our results show that negatively charged small molecules are excluded from the negatively charged cartilage tissue and have uptake kinetics in the order of hours. In contrast, the positively charged small molecules are drawn into the cartilage with uptake and release timescales ranging from hours to days. Using our calibrated computational model, we subsequently explore the effect of small molecule charge and binding constant on the rate of cartilage degradation. The results from this analysis indicate that the small molecules are most effective in inhibiting cartilage degradation if they are either positively charged and/or bind strongly to IL- 1 α, or both. Furthermore, our results showed that the cartilage structural homeostasis can be restored by the small molecule if administered within six days following initial tissue exposure to IL- 1 α. We finally extended the scope of the computational model by simulating the competitive inhibition of cartilage degradation by the small molecule. Results from this model show that small molecules are more efficient in inhibiting cartilage degradation by binding directly to IL- 1 α rather than binding to IL- 1 α receptors. The results from this study {{can be used as a}} template for the design and development of more <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> osteoarthritis drugs, and to investigate possible therapeutic options.

40|$|To {{be able to}} use the Göttingen minipig as an {{experimental}} animal model for endocrinological and pharmacological objectives, it must be possible to evaluate the pharmacological effect of a substance on the ovarian cycle of the animals. In a preliminary study, methods were tested for their practicability and significance to characterize the cycle by using six female minipigs. Suitable proved to be the natural toleration reflex, the redness/swelling of the vulva, the evaluation of the vaginal mucus, the ultrasound examination of the ovaries as well as the determination of the plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, 17 -ß-estradiol and progesterone. In a main study, 12 female animals (3 treatment groups, 1 control group) were treated intramuscularly for 24 days with levonorgestrel (LNG), a synthetic gestagen. The aim was to inhibit the ovulation of the animals and to determine the threshold dose for the inhibition of ovulation. The lowest <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> dose for the inhibition of ovulation was determined to be 0. 02 mg/kg/day LNG. In the 0. 002 mg/kg/day dose group, no clear estrus symptoms were evident on the outer genital. However, ovulation was confirmed by an ultrasound examination as well as the hormone concentrations at the end of the study. In the 0. 02 mg/kg/day and 0. 1 mg/kg/day dose groups, both behavior and all other measured parameters showed a clear interruption of the sexual cycle, and no ovulation occurred. Animals in both the mid- and high dose groups showed substance related effects, not only on the ovary but also on the vagina, uterus, and the organ weights. These results correlated with known effects observed in other species, e. g. the rat. Overall, the Göttinger minipig proved to be a very suitable animal model to test pharmacological hormone effects on the sexual cycle of the minipig. This was also applicable to the choice of methods, which offered an additional possibility to evaluate the gestagenic effects of hormones and other substances in toxicology studies...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharm.)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Different {{formulations}} of dosage forms of niclosamide, levamisole HCI or levamisole HCI and oxyclozanide {{have been used}} on the local market {{for a very long}} time. Unfortunately, the spectrum of each of the drugs alone has a very narrow therapeutic index. Together, however, they have a broad spectrum of action and it is a solution to most of the helminths infestations today. Because of the increasing cost to produce livestock, it is important to formulate a product that is not only <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> but also cost effective. A combination dosage form plays a big role in decreasing the cost of live stock production in that only one product is bought instead of more. A solution, suspension and tablet were formulated and tested. Niclosamide is very slightly soluble in water and is difficult to solubilise. A solution with niclosamide 3 %, oxyclozanide 3. 4 %, and levamisole HCI 2, 5 % was formulated. This was done because of the assumption that niclosamide is better absorbed in a solution and that the effective concentration needed is much lower. A suspension and a dispersible tablet with niclosamide 20 %, oxyclozanide 3. 4 %, and levamisole HCI 2, 5 % was formulated where the tablet is specially formulated to accommodate the smaller live stock farmers. All the above dosage forms were tested under accelerated stability conditions. Physical and chemical tests have been conducted on the dosage forms before and after storage at accelerated stability conditions. An assay was done on each of the three dosage forms where a HPLC method was developed and validated as there is no method in the literature that describe the simultaneous analyses of levamisole HCI, niclosamide and oxyclozanide in a dosage form. The results of al three dosage forms were very encouraging. The solution proved to be the most promising of all the formulations, and it might be worth while to put such a product on the market.

40|$|The {{administration}} of enantiopure drugs brings advantages such as improved efficacy, more predictable pharmacokinetics and reduced toxicity {{from the point}} of view of the pharmaceutical area. [1] For this reason, a tremendous amount of supply and demand for enantiomeric pure compounds has been shown not only in market, but industry and academia. [2 - 4] According to the industry publication Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News (GEN) in 2014, 22 billion dollars were accounted for enantiopure form of drugs such as Sovaldi® (Sofosbuvir), Crestor® (Rosuvastatin), and Advair® (fluticasone/salmeterol). The fact that one enantiomer can be <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> whereas the other enantiomer can be inactive or display non-desirable activity, chiral resolution and asymmetric synthesis research has broken out in recent years to obtain one desired stereoisomer. Enormous amounts of well-organized and rationalized research results for higher enantiomeric selectivity and efficiency has been reported with diverse chiral ligands and transition metals in academia. [5 - 10] However novelty-driven results from academic area does not meet the requirement in industry field for the practical issue, especially tedious separation process that require high cost and effort. In addition, methodologies developed with privileged chiral ligands and transition metal complexes leave a concern like undesired residue of trace amount of toxic metals in the products. In this dissertation, two types of heterogeneous asymmetric catalyst were investigated to find the alternative that accommodates industrial requirement to obtain enantiomeric pure compounds and novelty-driven academic demands. Firstly, constructions of rationally designed metal organic frameworks (MOFs) using chiral BINOL-derived phosphoric acid ligands were achieved. Overall, catalytic reactions with ocMOFs showed lower enatioselectivity than their homogeneous counterparts, but one of the MOFs, ocMOF- 1, was found to exhibit improved enantioselectivity than its homogeneous counterpart in the context of transfer hydrogenation reaction of benzoxazine. Lower enatioselectivity with ocMOFs was rationalized by the chiral environment change by the formation of frameworks in a computational study. In addition, self-supported heterogenization of chiral BINOL-phosphoric acid was achieved by the Yamamoto coupling reaction, and by using catalytically active ocPOP- 1 having nanoscopic channels, enantioselectivity was obtained up to 48...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} liquid {{chromatography}} tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) coupled with soft ionization method has expanded the scope for measurement of steroids from biological matrices with higher accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and requires less sample preparation. The overall {{aim of this}} study is to develop and validate LC-MS/MS methods to measure steroids from biological samples for clinical research studies. A sensitive and specific LC-MS/MS assay was developed and validated to measure steroids from dried blood spots (DBS) samples to assess the feasibility and pharmacology of subcutaneous (sc) injection of androgen ester in healthy men using DBS for frequent sampling. The study demonstrated a sustained release of this androgen ester which suggests that sc injections of testosterone esters may prove to be <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective.</b> A LC-MS/MS assay was also developed to measure urinary androgens and estrogen in adolescents and subsequently to relate the changes in the urinary sex hormones over 12 months to the standard anthropometric markers of puberty. We found that the urine hormone measurements correlated cross-sectionally and longitudinally with age, anthropometry and Tanner stage. We also investigated whether first morning void urine hormones in growing adolescents require adjustments for urine dilution/concentration and, if so, whether urinary creatinine or specific gravity (SG) are better adjustments. The study demonstrates that urine steroid and LH concentrations in first morning void samples of adolescents are not significantly influenced by hydration status and may not require adjustments; however, if desired, both creatinine and SG adjustments are equally suitable. We also assessed whether commercially available luteinizing hormone (LH) immunoassays (immunochemiluminometric, ICL and immunofluorometric, IF) previously validated for human blood samples is suitable for urine samples kept at prolonged frozen (4 years). We found that both immunoassays are suitable for urinary LH measurements with ICL assay being more robust for quantitative urinary LH measurement such as for anti-doping purpose whereas the IF could be applicable for research studies where urine LH levels are compared within-study but not in absolute terms...|$|R
40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} {{the most common form of}} cancer {{affecting}} women in Malaysia. Conventional drug treatment for breast cancer, chemotherapy would destroy the cancer cells because of the medicine targets on rapidly dividing cells. However, healthy cells and tissues in blood, mouth, intestinal tract, nose, nails, vagina and hair also divide rapidly, they could be damaged. A more promising technology called transdermal patch has been introduced due to side effects are common expected results from conventional treatment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to treat breast cancer by delivering drug from transdermal patch precisely and safely to targeted cancer cell so that reducing the side effects and dosage of drug used. The objectives of this study were to determine the drug concentration at breast tumor, to investigate the relationship between drug diffusivity and drug delivery efficiency, and to evaluate the efficiency of drug delivery under other parameters (i. e. deepness of tumor, temporal and spatial placement of transdermal patch). Available software, COMSOL was used in this study. Drug concentrations that able to diffuse and reach tumor in breast were studied. The simulation results showed that there was optimal drug diffusivity for maximum concentration of drug reached tumor in breast. However, below and higher than this drug diffusivity optimal value, the delivery of drug concentration was poorer when the lesser. Production of microchannels in the skin by microneedle can increase the drug diffusivity and ensure delivery of <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>effective</b> concentration of drug to the targeted site, breast cancer cell. Deeper the tumor grown within breast, lesser drug’s concentration could be diffused to it. However, this could be solved by changing the place of transdermal patch application. The nearer the spatial placement of transdermal patch to tumor growth in the breast on the breast skin increased the effectiveness of drug delivery to tumor. The longer the temporal placement resulted in higher drug concentration could be delivered to breast tumor. However, this constant concentration gradient only achieved for less than one month. After this, the concentration gradient would become zero. As a conclusion, the drug diffusivity, deepness of breast tumor, spatial and temporal placement of transdermal patch must be taken into account when engineering, constructing and applying the transdermal patch in order to achieve the maximum breast cancer treatment with reducing the undesired side effect...|$|R

40|$|In this investigation, the {{veratrine}} contraction was {{studied with}} special {{reference to the}} action of quinine, and from the results obtained, the following summary and conclusion are made 1. Various forms of veratrine contraction {{were found to be}} different representations of twitch and veratrine components, corresponding to the concentration of the drug, duration of the action of the drug (time factor), intensity and frequency of stimulations and individual sensitivity of muscles. 2. Veratrine-like contractions were evoked by glycerine and formaldehyde. 3. Veratrine contraction was obviated by lowering the temperature and facilitated by raising it. An intimate relations between the <b>effective</b> minimal <b>dosis</b> of veratrine and temperature were noted. 4. Veratrine contraction was depressed or abolished by calcium or potassium chlorides. Relations between threshold concentration of veratrine and calcium or potassium chlorides were determined. 5. Acidity inhibited the occurrence of veratrine contraction, alkalinity facilitated it. 6. Height of contraction of veratrinised muscle was higher than normal muscle, in twitch as welt as in tetanus. Refractory period of veratrine muscle was greatly prolonged and found in the descending phase of veratrine contraction. 7. Quinine obviated veratrine contraction. Veratrine-quinine equilibrium ratio was determined. 8. Atropine inhibited the action of veratrine on muscle. 9. Ergotoxine retarded or depressed the occurrence of veratrine contraction, when applied previously, while if applied afterwards, it exaggerated at first, then alleviated gradually veratrine contraction. 10. Acetylcholine had no effect on veratrine contraction. Eserine, like atropine, inhibited veratrine contraction. 11. Adrenaline caused complete dissociation of twitch and veratrine components. 12. Monoiodoacetic acid had no effect on the occurrence of veratrine contraction. 13. Veratrine had no effect on isolated frog's heart. 14. Veratrine caused increased tonicity and irregular tonic contraction on non-striated muscles (dorsal muscle of leech, intestine and uterus of guinea-pig). </p...|$|R
40|$|Systemic {{glucocorticoid}} therapy may effectively attenuate lung inflammation {{but also}} induce severe side-effects. Delivery of glucocorticoids by liposomes could therefore be beneficial. We investigated if liposome-encapsulated dexamethasone inhibited ventilator-induced lung inflammation. Furthermore, we evaluated whether targeting of cellular Fcγ-receptors (FcγRs) by conjugating immunoglobulin G (IgG) to liposomes, {{would improve the}} efficacy of dexamethasone-liposomes in attenuating granulocyte infiltration, one {{of the hallmarks of}} lung inflammation. Mice were anaesthetized, tracheotomized and mechanically ventilated for 5 h with either 'low' tidal volumes ∼ 7. 5 mL·kg(- 1) (LV(T)) or 'high' tidal volumes ∼ 15 mL·kg(- 1) (HV(T)). At initiation of ventilation, we intravenously administered dexamethasone encapsulated in liposomes (Dex-liposomes), dexamethasone encapsulated in IgG-modified liposomes (IgG-Dex-liposomes) or free dexamethasone. Non-ventilated mice served as controls. Dex-liposomes attenuated granulocyte infiltration and IL- 6 mRNA expression after LV(T) -ventilation, but not after HV(T) -ventilation. Dex-liposomes also down-regulated mRNA expression of IL- 1 β and KC, but not of CCL 2 (MCP- 1) in lungs of LV(T) and HV(T) -ventilated mice. Importantly, IgG-Dex-liposomes inhibited granulocyte influx caused by either LV(T) or HV(T) -ventilation. IgG-Dex-liposomes diminished IL- 1 β and KC mRNA expression in both ventilation groups, and IL- 6 and CCL 2 mRNA expression in the LV(T) -ventilated group. Free dexamethasone prevented granulocyte influx and inflammatory mediator expression induced by LV(T) or HV(T) -ventilation. FcγR-targeted IgG-Dex-liposomes are <b>pharmacologically</b> more <b>effective</b> than Dex-liposomes particularly in inhibiting pulmonary granulocyte infiltration. IgG-Dex-liposomes inhibited most parameters of ventilator-induced lung inflammation as effectively as free dexamethasone, with the advantage that liposome-encapsulated dexamethasone will be released locally in the lung thereby preventing systemic side-effect...|$|R
