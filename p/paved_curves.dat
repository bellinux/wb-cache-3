5000|$|The northernmost end of {{the road}} lies at the very foot of the San Gabriel Mountains in Altadena and {{immediately}} accesses Las Flores Canyon. The first resident of Las Flores Canyon was the Forsyth Ranch. It sold in 1919 to Mr. Cobb who had an enormous and fascinating estate on the alluvial fan which emanates from the Canyon. Las Flores was also known for its small and short-lived gold mining operations there. The Cobb Estate was deeded to the United States Forest Service as a free growth Arboretum in 1967. The gates on Lake Avenue mark the entrance to the estate which still has its long, <b>paved,</b> <b>curving</b> driveway which leads {{to the site of the}} defunct manor. The adjacent trailhead of the Sam Merrill Trail also leads into the canyon from Lake Avenue. This is the origin of the local term [...] "top of Lake," [...] which refers to the northernmost neighborhoods.|$|R

2500|$|In the 1950s, a push began for an {{all-weather}} route connecting northwestern Nevada, southern Oregon, and {{the redwood}} region of California‚Äîat the time, {{there were no}} improved roads directly connecting these areas. Community leaders along the route formed an association to promote {{what they called the}} [...] "Winnemucca to the Sea Highway". Efforts to realize the association's goals moved forward in the next decade. By 1960, Nevada officials had paved a portion of State Route 8A west of Denio. Instead of following SR 8A to Vya, the newly <b>paved</b> road <b>curved</b> northwest to the Oregon border near the Humboldt‚ÄìWashoe county line. Oregon officials constructed a new paved road linking Adel to the Nevada state line in 1962. This work completed the [...] stretch of Winnemucca to the Sea Highway between Denio Junction and Lakeview, Oregon. The Winnemucca to the Sea Association, however, envisioned Route 140 as a continuous number‚Äîbranching from [...] "parent" [...] highway U.S. Route 40 in Winnemucca‚Äîthat would be applied to the entire length of highway. By 1968, State Route 140 had been designated along the paved portions of SR 8A, with Oregon Route 140 continuing on to Adel and Lakeview. State Route 140 was also signed along US 95 south into Winnemucca‚Äîthis section of SR 140 was later removed in the 1970s.|$|R
40|$|Raman-assistance (RA) {{has been}} {{identified}} as a promising technique to extend the measurement range of Brillouin optical time-domain analysis (BOTDA) -based distributed sensors. Unfortunately, Raman amplification introduces a great amount of relative intensity noise (RIN) to the detected low-frequency probe wave. This RIN transfer problem has been widely identified as a major limitation in RA-BOTDA. In vector BOTDA (VBOTDA), the detected signal is transferred to a high-frequency carrier where the Raman RIN transfer turns out to be much less harmful. In addition, a VBOTDA can also provide information about the phase-shift induced by the local stimulated Brillouin scattering gain <b>curve,</b> <b>paving</b> the way for dynamic measurements. In this letter, we demonstrate, {{for the first time to}} our knowledge, the RA in a VBOTDA obtaining gain and phase measurements. Our results show a significant reduction of the RIN transfer effect in RA-VBOTDA compared with standard RA-BOTDA, making this type of scheme particularly interesting for long-range and dynamic distributed sensing. ¬© 2013 IEEE.

40|$|In April 2008 a {{preliminary}} investigation of fatal and major injury crashes on Iowa‚Äôs primary road system from 2001 through 2007 {{was conducted by}} the Iowa Department of Transportation, Office of Traffic and Safety. A mapping of these data revealed an apparent concentration of these serious crashes on a section of Iowa 25 north of Creston. Based on this information, a road safety audit of this roadway section was requested by the Office of Traffic and Safety. Iowa 25 is a two-lane asphaltic concrete pavement roadway, 22 ft in width with approximately 6 ft wide granular shoulders. Originally constructed in 1939, the roadway was last rehabilitated in 1996 with a 4 -in. asphalt overlay. Except for shoulder <b>paving</b> through a <b>curve</b> area, no additional work beyond routine maintenance has been accomplished in the section. The 2004 traffic map indicates that IA 25 has a traffic volume of approximately 2070 vehicles per day with 160 commercial vehicles. The posted speed is 55 mph. This report contains a discussion of audit team findings, crash and roadway data, and recommendations for possible mitigation of safety concerns for this roadway section...|$|R
5000|$|The ancient {{fortress}} of Siwa, {{known as the}} Shali Ghadi ("Shali" [...] being {{the name of the}} town, and [...] "Ghadi" [...] meaning remote), was built on natural rock (an inselberg) and made of kershif (salt and mud-brick) and palm logs. After it was damaged by three days of heavy rains in 1926 it was abandoned for similar unreinforced construction housing on the plain surrounding it, and in some cases those in turn have been replaced by more modern cinder block and sheet metal roof buildings. Only one building in the Shali complex has been repaired and is in use, a mosque. Gradually eroded by infrequent rains and slowly collapsing, the Shali remains a prominent feature, towering five stories above the modern town and lit at night by floodlights. It is most easily approached from its southwest side, south {{of the end of the}} <b>paved</b> road which <b>curves</b> around from the north side of the Shali. Several uneven pedestrian streets lead from the southwest end of the Shali into it, the ground rent in places by deep cracks. Many of the unreinforced kershif buildings bordering the streets of the Shali are also split by large cracks, or they are partially collapsed.|$|R
