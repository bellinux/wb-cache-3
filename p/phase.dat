5|$|As {{a result}} of such dynamics, Pleione {{exhibits}} prominent long-term photometric and spectroscopic variations encompassing a period of about 35 years. In fact, during the last 100 years, Pleione has demonstrated notable <b>phase</b> changesas a Be <b>phase</b> until 1903, a B <b>phase</b> (1905–1936), a B-shell <b>phase</b> (1938–1954), and another Be <b>phase</b> (1955–1972). It then entered a Be-shell <b>phase</b> in 1972. Then, the star developed many shell absorption lines in its spectrum. At the same time, the star showed a decrease in brightness, beginning at the end of 1971. After reaching the minimum brightness in late 1973, the star gradually brightened. In 1989, Pleione entered a Be <b>phase</b> and stayed as a Be star until the summer of 2005.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial growth follows four phases. When a {{population}} of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first <b>phase</b> of growth is the lag <b>phase,</b> a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The lag <b>phase</b> has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second <b>phase</b> of growth is the log <b>phase,</b> {{also known as the}} logarithmic or exponential <b>phase.</b> The log <b>phase</b> is marked by rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells grow during this <b>phase</b> is known as the growth rate (k), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the generation time (g). During log <b>phase,</b> nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third <b>phase</b> of growth is the stationary <b>phase</b> and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary <b>phase</b> is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport. The final <b>phase</b> is the death <b>phase</b> where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die.|$|E

Other concepts that are used are: <b>phased</b> implementation, <b>phased</b> conversion, <b>phased</b> approach, <b>phased</b> strategy, <b>phased</b> introduction and staged conversion.|$|R
5000|$|Using {{the notion}} of quantum entanglement, one obtains the {{following}} general picture of gappedphases at zero temperature.

All short-range entangled <b>phases</b> can be further divided into three classes: [...] symmetry-breaking <b>phases,</b> SPT <b>phases,</b> and their mix (symmetry breaking order and SPT order can appear together).|$|R

5000|$|One {{study on}} a single cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) showed it purred with an average {{frequency}} of 20.87 Hz (egressive <b>phases)</b> and 18.32 Hz (ingressive <b>phases).</b> [...] A further study on four adult cheetahs found that mean frequencies were between 19.3 Hz and 20.5 Hz in ingressive <b>phases,</b> and between 21.9 Hz and 23.4 Hz in egressive <b>phases.</b> The egressive <b>phases</b> were longer than ingressive <b>phases</b> and moreover, the amplitude was greater in the egressive <b>phases.</b>|$|R

5|$|A phase-to-amplitude {{converter}} (PAC), {{which uses}} the <b>phase</b> accumulator output word (<b>phase</b> word) usually as an index into a waveform look-up table (LUT) {{to provide a}} corresponding amplitude sample.

5|$|At a given {{temperature}} a {{lipid bilayer}} can exist in either a liquid or a gel (solid) <b>phase.</b> All lipids have a characteristic temperature at which they transition (melt) from the gel to liquid <b>phase.</b> In both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer, but in liquid <b>phase</b> bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second. This random walk exchange allows lipid to diffuse and thus wander {{across the surface of}} the membrane. Unlike liquid <b>phase</b> bilayers, the lipids in a gel <b>phase</b> bilayer have less mobility.|$|E
30|$|Note that inspiratory <b>phases</b> {{were fewer}} {{in number and}} shorter in {{duration}} as compared to expiratory <b>phases.</b> Hence, less data were available for training the HMM for inspiratory <b>phases</b> as compared to expiratory <b>phases.</b> Moreover, {{it needs to be}} emphasized here that inspiratory <b>phases</b> exhibited more variations throughout the data in comparison to expiratory <b>phases.</b> For example, on the one hand, we had recordings with very short or almost no discernible inspiratory <b>phases,</b> and on the other hand, we had recordings which have unusually prominent inspiratory <b>phases</b> as compared to expiratory <b>phases.</b> It is also possible to observe both these extreme cases within the same recording.|$|R
50|$|In a {{follow-up}} study of purring in four adult cheetahs, Eklund, Peters, Weise & Munro (2012) found that egressive <b>phases</b> were longer than ingressive <b>phases</b> in four cheetahs. Likewise, ingressive <b>phases</b> {{had a lower}} frequency than egressive <b>phases</b> in all four cheetahs. Mean frequency were between 19.3 Hz and 20.5 Hz in ingressive <b>phases,</b> and between 21.9 Hz and 23.4 Hz in egressive <b>phases.</b> Moreover, the amplitude was louder in the egressive <b>phases</b> in four cheetahs.|$|R
30|$|It is {{observed}} that the segmentation system works sufficiently well for expiratory <b>phases</b> but performs rather poorly for inspiratory <b>phases</b> in comparison. The {{reason for this is}} the diverse nature of inspiratory <b>phases</b> present in our data set. Additionally, less data were available for training the system to identify inspiratory <b>phases</b> as compared to expiratory <b>phases.</b> The performance of the system for inspiratory <b>phases</b> is expected to improve with the availability of more training material.|$|R
5|$|Continuously {{variable}} <b>phase</b> {{control circuits}} {{are common in}} subwoofer amplifiers, and {{may be found in}} crossovers and as do-it-yourself electronics projects. <b>Phase</b> controls allow the listener to change the arrival time of the subwoofer sound waves relative to the same frequencies from the main speakers (i.e., at and around the crossover point to the subwoofer). A similar effect can be achieved with the delay control on many home theater receivers. The subwoofer <b>phase</b> control found on many subwoofer amplifiers is actually a polarity inversion switch. It allows users to reverse the polarity of the subwoofer relative to the audio signal it is being given. This type of control allows the subwoofer to either be in <b>phase</b> with the source signal, or 180 degrees out of <b>phase.</b>|$|E

30|$|Unlike {{precedent}} methods {{performed in}} this article, the independent studies of boom <b>phases</b> and recession <b>phases</b> require more careful treatment. As {{a matter of}} fact, we can consider that coefficients of the VAR model will be different between boom <b>phases</b> and recession <b>phases,</b> as found in a Markov switching vector autoregression (MS–VAR) model, except that the switching years are known. In practice, different VAR models will be fit for boom <b>phases,</b> recession <b>phases,</b> and all <b>phases,</b> by hiding years not belonging to their respective set. However, VAR coefficients are estimated on lagged values that can lie outside the studied set.|$|R

5|$|Interferometry {{makes use}} of the {{principle}} of superposition to combine waves {{in a way that will}} cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves. This works because when two waves with the same frequency combine, the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the <b>phase</b> difference between the two waves—waves that are in <b>phase</b> will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out of <b>phase</b> will undergo destructive interference. Waves which are not completely in <b>phase</b> nor completely out of <b>phase</b> will have an intermediate intensity pattern, which can be used to determine their relative <b>phase</b> difference. Most interferometers use light or some other form of electromagnetic wave.|$|E

40|$|<b>Phased</b> Logic (PL) is a {{synthesis}} and mapping methodology that translates a standard synchronous gate-level netlist to a non-clocked netlist of special gates called <b>phased</b> logic gates [1][2][3].

An analysis of the dynamic power consumption of a <b>phased</b> logic system reveals a major deficiency in the original programmable LUT-based design [2], leading to an alternate <b>phased</b> logic gate design.
