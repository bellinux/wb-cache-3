5|$|Aspirin {{and other}} NSAIDs can cause {{abnormally}} high {{blood levels of}} potassium by inducing a hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronic state via inhibition of <b>prostaglandin</b> synthesis; however, these agents do not typically cause hyperkalemia by themselves {{in the setting of}} normal renal function and euvolemic state.|$|E
5|$|If oral {{medications}} and mechanical treatments fail, the second choice is local injections: medications such as papaverine and <b>prostaglandin</b> that alter the blood flow and trigger erection are {{injected into the}} penis.

5|$|Surgical {{excision}} of aphthous ulcers has been described, {{but it is}} an ineffective and inappropriate treatment. Silver nitrate has also been used as a chemical cauterant. Apart from the mainstream approaches detailed above, there are numerous treatments of unproven effectiveness, ranging from herbal remedies to otherwise alternative treatments, including aloe vera, myrtus communis, Rosa damascena, potassium alum, zinc sulfate, nicotine, polio virus vaccine and <b>prostaglandin</b> E2.|$|E
40|$|The <b>prostaglandins</b> are {{naturally}} occurring unsaturated fatty acids {{which have been}} implicated {{in a variety of}} physiologic and pathophysiologic processes involving organ function. One of the most striking actions of <b>prostaglandins</b> of the E and A series is their capacity to dilate peripheral blood vessels and thereby to lower arterial pressure. This vasodilating effect of <b>prostaglandins</b> may be mediated by alterations in circulating blood levels of the hormone(s) or by changes in concentration of <b>prostaglandins</b> in blood vessel walls. <b>Prostaglandins</b> also have been implicated in the regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In addition, a direct effect of <b>prostaglandins</b> in modulating both renal blood flow and renal tubular sodium reabsorption has been suggested. An effect of <b>prostaglandins</b> to inhibit the action of vasopressin to increase water permeability in the mammalian collecting duct also has been proposed. In the present editorial we will briefly survey the evidence for and against the proposed actions of <b>prostaglandins</b> in regulating blood pressure, renal blood flow and renal sodium and water excretion...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Prostaglandins</b> are hormone-like {{substances}} {{that affect the}} body in variety of ways, also regulating inflammatory mediation. An anti-flammatory diet includes fewer foods that create inflammation-causing <b>prostaglandins</b> (PGE2) in the body, and more foods that create anti-inflammatory <b>prostaglandins</b> (PGE1 and PGE3).|$|R
5|$|Low-dose aspirin use irreversibly {{blocks the}} {{formation}} of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8–9 days). This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in {{people who have had}} a heart attack, unstable angina, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. 40mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A2 release provoked acutely, with the <b>prostaglandin</b> I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.|$|E
5|$|However, {{several of}} the new COX-2 inhibitors, such as rofecoxib (Vioxx), have been {{withdrawn}} in the last decade, after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors {{increase the risk of}} heart attack and stroke. Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express PTGS2, and, by selectively inhibiting PTGS2, <b>prostaglandin</b> production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as PTGS1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of PGI2 is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Richard Richter {{developed}} the first intrauterine device made from silkworm gut, which was further developed and marketed in Germany by Ernst Gräfenberg {{in the late}} 1920s. In 1951, a chemist, named Carl Djerassi from Mexico City made the hormones in progesterone pills using Mexican yams. Djerassi had chemically created the pill but was not equipped to distribute them to patients. Meanwhile, Gregory Pincus and John Rock {{with help from the}} Planned Parenthood Federation of America {{developed the}} first birth control pills in the 1950s, such as mestranol/noretynodrel, which became publicly available in the 1960s through the Food and Drug Administration under the name Enovid. Medical abortion became an alternative to surgical abortion with the availability of <b>prostaglandin</b> analogs in the 1970s and mifepristone in the 1980s.|$|E
40|$|Human foetal {{small and}} large {{intestine}} responded to <b>prostaglandins</b> E 2 and F 2 α, the gestational age of the tissue being between 14 and 26 weeks.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} {{exogenous}} <b>prostaglandins,</b> inflammatory mediators {{known to be}} increased in pancreatic β-cells by IL- 1 β, on the replication and long-term insulin secretion by β-cells were investigated. <b>Prostaglandins</b> E 1, E 2, and F 2 α suppressed β-cell proliferation and long-term insulin secretion, thus mimicking the effects of IL- 1 β. The actions of <b>prostaglandins</b> were not prevented by pertussis toxin pretreatment. Additionally, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin could not prevent the effects of IL- 1 β. It is concluded that <b>prostaglandins</b> suppress β-cell growth and long-term insulin secretion without participation of pertussis-toxin sensitive GTP-binding proteins. In addition, although their synthesis is increased by IL- 1 β, <b>prostaglandins</b> seemingly do not convey the inhibitory actions of this cytokine in the β-cell...|$|R
40|$|Lipids were {{extracted}} from bovine gingival tissues and examined by thin-layer chroma-tography and ultraviolet absorption spectros-copy for-the presence of <b>prostaglandins.</b> Results indicated that these tissues contained {{a variety of}} <b>prostaglandins,</b> including PGEj, PGE 2, PGF 2, and certain of their metabo-lites. Numerous studies have been reported that describe the occurrence of <b>prostaglandins</b> in various fluids", 2 and tissues 3 - 7 from hu-man and other mammalian species. How-ever, {{the current state of}} knowledge per-taining to the occurrence of <b>prostaglandins</b> in oral tissues is limited to a single study that reports the presence of PGE 2 in human gingival tissue. 8 The present study deals with the detection of <b>prostaglandins</b> in bo-vine gingival tissue. The occurrence of <b>prostaglandins</b> in bovine gingiva seemed likely in view of the earlier observation 9 that the lipid material {{extracted from}} bo-vine gingiva contained a fairly large con-centration of arachidonic acid, a potential precursor in the biosynthesis of prostaglan-dins. 10 Materials and Method...|$|R
5|$|Since inhibitors {{modulate}} {{the function}} of enzymes they are often used as drugs. Many such drugs are reversible competitive inhibitors that resemble the enzyme's native substrate, similar to methotrexate above; other well-known examples include statins used to treat high cholesterol, and protease inhibitors used to treat retroviral infections such as HIV. A common example of an irreversible inhibitor that {{is used as a}} drug is aspirin, which inhibits the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes that produce the inflammation messenger <b>prostaglandin.</b> Other enzyme inhibitors are poisons. For example, the poison cyanide is an irreversible enzyme inhibitor that combines with the copper and iron in the active site of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase and blocks cellular respiration.|$|E
25|$|Misoprostol, a <b>prostaglandin</b> analogue, binds to myometrial {{cells to}} cause strong myometrial contractions leading to {{expulsion}} of tissue. This agent also causes cervical ripening with softening and dilation of the cervix. Misoprostol binds to and stimulates <b>prostaglandin</b> E1 receptors, <b>prostaglandin</b> EP3 receptor and <b>prostaglandin</b> EP4 receptor but not <b>Prostaglandin</b> EP1 receptor and therefore {{is expected to}} have a more restricted range of physiological and potentially toxic actions than <b>prostaglandin</b> E2 or other analogs which activate all four <b>prostaglandin</b> receptors.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} is a comparison {{of different types of}} <b>prostaglandin,</b> prostacyclin I2 (PGI2), <b>prostaglandin</b> E2 (PGE2), and <b>prostaglandin</b> F2α (PGF2α).|$|E
50|$|During the 1960s a U.K. {{research}} team, {{headed by}} Professor John Vane began {{to explore the}} role of <b>prostaglandins</b> in anaphylaxis and respiratory diseases.

40|$|Examination of a soluble {{fraction}} {{derived from}} homogenates of rabbit kidney papilla revealed {{the existence of}} a 15 -hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase specific for A-type <b>prostaglandins.</b> <b>Prostaglandins</b> of the E- and F-series were not substrates for this enzyme. In agreement with published data, the 15 -hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase(s) derived from the kidney cortex were found to degrade all <b>prostaglandins</b> examined (PGE, PGF, PGA) in the presence of added cofactor NAD. Thus it is evident that in this species the kidney 15 -hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenases are anatomically compartmentalized so that the papilla is able to metabpable of degrading E-, F-, and A-type <b>prostaglandins</b> by this metabolic pathway...|$|R
25|$|The name <b>prostaglandin</b> {{derives from}} the {{prostate}} gland. When <b>prostaglandin</b> was first isolated from seminal fluid in 1935 by the Swedish physiologist Ulf von Euler, and independently by M.W. Goldblatt, it {{was believed to be}} part of the prostatic secretions. In fact, prostaglandins are produced by the seminal vesicles. It was later shown that many other tissues secrete prostaglandins for various functions. The first total syntheses of <b>prostaglandin</b> F2α and <b>prostaglandin</b> E2 were reported by E. J. Corey in 1969, an achievement for which he was awarded the Japan Prize in 1989.|$|E
25|$|Prostaglandins were {{originally}} believed {{to leave the}} cells via passive diffusion because of their high lipophilicity. The discovery of the <b>prostaglandin</b> transporter (PGT, SLCO2A1), which mediates the cellular uptake of <b>prostaglandin,</b> demonstrated that diffusion alone cannot explain the penetration of <b>prostaglandin</b> through the cellular membrane. The release of <b>prostaglandin</b> has now {{also been shown to}} be mediated by a specific transporter, namely the multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4, ABCC4), a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily. Whether MRP4 is the only transporter releasing prostaglandins from the cells is still unclear.|$|E
25|$|Cyclooxygenases {{have two}} main isoforms that are called COX-1 and COX-2 (as {{well as a}} COX-3). COX-1 is {{responsible}} for the synthesis of <b>prostaglandin</b> and thromboxane in many types of cells, including the gastro-intestinal tract and blood platelets. COX-2 {{plays a major role in}} <b>prostaglandin</b> biosynthesis in inflammatory cells and in the central nervous system. <b>Prostaglandin</b> synthesis in these sites is a key factor in the development of inflammation and hyperalgesia.|$|E
40|$|The role of <b>prostaglandins</b> in {{reproductive}} physiology is reviewed {{with particular}} emphasis on their possible importance in ovulation in humans. A possible interaction between gonadal steroids, biogenic amines and <b>prostaglandins</b> at hypothalamic-pituitary level, {{in relation to the}} release of luteinizing hormone releasing factor, and LH, is discussed. Anomalies regarding the role of oestrogens in LH release are noted, and it is suggested that high oestrogen levels may release <b>prostaglandins</b> from the uterus and/or centrally in humans, in connection with the mid-cycle LH surge and ovulation. A hypothetical role for <b>prostaglandins</b> in sexual behaviour and premenstrual changes is discussed...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Vitreous {{samples were}} {{obtained}} from 41 eyes undergoing vitrectomy, and radio-immunoassays were performed to measure concentrations of the <b>prostaglandins</b> PGE 2, PGF 2 a, prostacyclin, and thromboxane. Presumably physiological levels (approximately 100 pico-grams/ml) were found in vitreous from eyes undergoing cataract extraction. Eyes with vitreous haemorrhage, retinal detachment, or cystoid macular oedema had similarly low levels. Vitreous <b>prostaglandins</b> were mildly elevated in trauma and endophthalmitis and markedly elevated in aphakic bullous keratopathy. The role <b>prostaglandins</b> may play in cystoid macular oedema is reviewed. <b>Prostaglandins</b> are important mediators of inflamma-tion, and the synthesis of these vasoactive prost-aglandin compounds (PGE 2, PGF 2 a, prostacyclin [PGI 2]) by ocular tissues has been demonstrated.

25|$|There are {{currently}} ten known <b>prostaglandin</b> receptors on various cell types. Prostaglandins ligate a sub-family of cell surface seven-transmembrane receptors, G-protein-coupled receptors. These receptors are termed DP1-2, EP1-4, FP, IP1-2, and TP, {{corresponding to the}} receptor that ligates the corresponding <b>prostaglandin</b> (e.g., DP1-2 receptors bind to PGD2).|$|E

25|$|Common {{side effects}} include {{diarrhea}} and abdominal pain. It is pregnancy category X {{meaning that it}} is known to result in negative outcomes for the baby if taken during pregnancy.

50|$|<b>Prostaglandins</b> whose {{synthesis}} {{involves the}} cyclooxygenase-I enzyme, or COX-1, {{are responsible for}} maintenance and protection of the gastrointestinal tract, while <b>prostaglandins</b> whose synthesis involves the cyclooxygenase-II enzyme, or COX-2, are responsible for inflammation and pain.|$|R
50|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) alleviate pain by counteracting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme.

30|$|Conclusion These {{results show}} that the {{juvenile}} rat brains mostly responds to ischemia by a COX- 2 -dependent <b>prostaglandins</b> production, and suggest that the transcriptional responses observed under 7 -NI facilitate and reorient COX- 2 -dependent <b>prostaglandins</b> production.|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} early first-trimester medical {{abortion}} regimens use mifepristone {{in combination with}} a <b>prostaglandin</b> analog (misoprostol or gemeprost) up to 9 weeks gestational age, methotrexate in combination with a <b>prostaglandin</b> analog up to 7 weeks gestation, or a <b>prostaglandin</b> analog alone. Mifepristone–misoprostol combination regimens work faster and are more effective at later gestational ages than methotrexate–misoprostol combination regimens, and combination regimens are more effective than misoprostol alone. This regime is effective in the second trimester. Medical abortion regiments involving mifepristone followed by misoprostol in the cheek between 24 and 48 hours later are effective when performed before 63 days' gestation.|$|E
25|$|The {{structural}} {{differences between}} prostaglandins account for their different biological activities. A given <b>prostaglandin</b> {{may have different}} and even opposite effects in different tissues. The ability of the same <b>prostaglandin</b> to stimulate a reaction in one tissue and inhibit the same reaction in another tissue {{is determined by the}} type of receptor to which the <b>prostaglandin</b> binds. They act as autocrine or paracrine factors with their target cells present in the immediate vicinity of the site of their secretion. Prostaglandins differ from endocrine hormones in that they are not produced at a specific site but in many places throughout the human body.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{crosstalk}} occurs between androgens and the Wnt-beta-catenin {{signaling pathway}} {{that leads to}} hair loss. At {{the level of the}} somatic stem cell, androgens promote differentiation of facial hair dermal papillae, but inhibit it at the scalp. Other research suggests the enzyme <b>prostaglandin</b> D2 synthase and its product <b>prostaglandin</b> D2 (PGD2) in hair follicles as contributive.|$|E
40|$|<b>Prostaglandins</b> play an {{important}} role in mediating many aspects of gastrointestinal mucosal defense. This role was highlighted first by the demonstration that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which have well-characterized ulcerogenic effects in the upper gastroin-testinal tract, inhibit the synthesis of pr~staglandins~l and that the dimin-ished capacity of the stomach to produce <b>prostaglandins</b> contributed to the generation of Subsequent demonstrations that minute quantities of <b>prostaglandins</b> could protect the upperx and lowef 18 gastro-intestinal tract from damage in several experimental models further emphasized the importance of this group of fatty acids in mucosal defense. In mammals, <b>prostaglandins</b> are produced mainly from arachidonic acid, which can be liberated from membrane phospholipids through the action of phospholipase A, or phospholipase C. The liberated arachi-donic acid can be metabolized by several enzymes to yield a vast array of vasoactive and immunomodulatory substances, termed eicosanoids.
