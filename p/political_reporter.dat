40|$|Reports from Trump {{rallies in}} recent days echo a common theme: if their {{candidate}} loses there will be anger, despair, even revolution. Trump supporters site the election as being rigged – of {{which there is no}} evidence – and a corrupt system. It’s language the presidential candidate himself uses. While <b>political</b> <b>reporters</b> note most Trump supporters are not calling for “revolution” the words from the campaign this season have many asking what constitutes dangerous political speech and how it can incite people to act. We get perspectives from a <b>political</b> scientist, a <b>reporter</b> and legal scholars...|$|R

25|$|Although Hazlitt had {{aimed at}} a career in philosophy, {{he was unable to}} make a living by it. His studies and {{extensive}} thinking about the problems of the day, however, provided a basis for judging contemporary thinkers. (He had already begun, before he was thirty, with an extensive critique of Malthus's theory of population.) After having practised for a while as an artist (a major part of his background that entered into the making of this book not in the selection of its content but as it helped inform his critical sensibility and his writing style), he found work as a <b>political</b> <b>reporter,</b> which exposed him to the major politicians and issues of the day.|$|E
25|$|Presenting {{a marked}} {{contrast}} to Brougham, whom Hazlitt believed to have shown some of the deviousness of (in Hazlitt's formulation) the typical Scot, Hazlitt subjoins a brief sketch of Sir Francis Burdett. Burdett (1770–1844), scion of the Burdett family of Bramcote, was a Member of Parliament from 1797 until his death. A celebrated reformer and friend of the people, his connexion to Hazlitt {{goes back to the}} gatherings of Horne Tooke, of whom Burdett had been a follower, and, in later years, to his representing Parliament as Member for Westminister, where Hazlitt was a householder from 1811 to 1819, and thus could vote for him. During this time Hazlitt, as a <b>political</b> <b>reporter,</b> had numerous opportunities to hear Burdett speak. Of all politicians, Burdett, whom he saw as representing a type of traditional Englishman, was the one with whom he was the most in sympathy, and whose principles (for which Burdett had been imprisoned in 1810) Hazlitt most shared.|$|E
500|$|Huntsman {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "a conservative technocrat-optimist with moderate positions who was willing to work substantively with President Barack Obama" [...] by Huffington Post <b>political</b> <b>reporter,</b> Jason Linkins. As Governor, Huntsman listed economic development, health-care reform, education, and energy security as his top priorities. Huntsman oversaw large tax cuts and advocated reorganizing the way that services were distributed so that the government would not become overwhelmed by the state's fast growing population. Huntsman also proposed a plan to reform health-care, mainly through the private sector, by using tax breaks and negotiation to keep prices down.|$|E
40|$|Professional project report {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Journalism from the School of Journalism, University of Missouri [...] Columbia. This	researched looked at how journalism has changed and how the prevalence of infotainment has {{had an impact on}} <b>political</b> <b>reporters</b> in print journalism. Ten <b>political</b> <b>reporters</b> from large print publications or news bureaus based in the Washington D. c. were questioned using structured and semi-structured interviews about how their experience in the industry has changed since infotainment became present in journalism. The results indicate that though they see infotainment generally affecting journalism, they said their publications have fought against this shift by remaining focused on hard news. Although many of the journalists interviewed thought infotainment doesn't affect them personally, there has been an increase in challenges some journalists experience, such as securing interviews with political figures. This research is important because it examines how print publications and the journalists who cover politics are affected by a shift in the journalism landscape...|$|R

Schwarzenegger responded via his lawyer, threatening to sue South for libel.|$|R
500|$|The {{previous}} poet laureate, Gerald Stern, {{said that}} he advocated for Baraka's selection because he [...] "thought {{it was important for}} the black community to get recognition." [...] Slate.com <b>political</b> <b>reporter</b> David Weigel said that McGreevey's selection of Baraka [...] "was a no-brainer—he was a sort of icon, and a major figure within a constituency McGreevey counted on". At a ceremony in August 2002, Baraka warned McGreevey that the decision to appoint him as poet laureate might be a mistake because of his controversial views, saying [...] "You're gonna catch hell for this". After Baraka's death in January 2014, McGreevey said, [...] "I named him poet laureate because I appreciated his art, his intelligence and his creative energy. I’ve always had great personal affect(ion) for him and recognized him as a gifted creative force." ...|$|E
500|$|Mark Davies, the <b>political</b> <b>reporter</b> for BBC News Online, criticised the script's bias towards Brown and Sheen's {{apparently}} negative performance; [...] "Michael Sheen {{at first}} plays Blair {{in the style}} of Spitting Images David Steel puppet: bounding along next to his far superior colleague like an over-eager puppy. The actor later transforms Blair into something more sinister and cynical [...] Think Rik Mayall's Alan B'stard." [...] As with other critics, Davies admired Morrissey's performance, singling out the actor's grasp of Brown's physical tics. For the Daily Express, James Rampton singled out the balance of drama and humour. Upon broadcast in the United States—and in retrospect of The Queen—The Boston Globes Matthew Gilbert called it [...] "tightly written and effectively acted, and yet it still plays more like a docudramatic re-creation than a Shakespearean glimpse at brotherly tension." [...] Of Morrissey, Gilbert wrote [...] "He brings depth to Brown, a Scot, as a moody, private workaholic whose passion is in ideas and not in performing to the public." ...|$|E
500|$|Isenhour was {{an early}} {{supporter}} of Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf, and became Wolf's senior campaign adviser during his 2014 campaign, {{at a time when}} state Representative Allyson Schwartz and state Treasurer Rob McCord were considered to have better chances of winning. Isenhour, who had long been acquainted with Wolf, had not intended to become involved with a lengthy and work-intensive gubernatorial campaign, but said she was convinced to do so after an hour-long phone conversation with Wolf in 2013, after which she was convinced he was the right man for the job: [...] "I've been in politics 30 years and I've never had a candidate like this." [...] Isenhour maintained other clients during his campaign, but said Wolf was [...] "my main focus for the next year and a half". After Wolf's successful election, Isenhour co-chaired his inaugural committee, then worked as his Secretary of Legislative Affairs, serving as a liaison during negotiating sessions at the Pennsylvania General Assembly, and providing key planning during the governor's budget strategy. <b>Political</b> <b>reporter</b> John L. Micek wrote of Isenhour: [...] "She is in the unique position of having to work with Republicans she once ran campaigns against." [...] Her annual salary in the position was $145,018. Isenhour developed a reputation for communicating and building relationships with legislative leaders and staff members from both parties.|$|E
