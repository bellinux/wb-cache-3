40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{relationship}} between causal attribution beliefs of students and their self-esteem. The sample of the study comprised of 3614 students including 1868 male and 1746 female students studying in the 10 th grade from 72 public sector schools across 6 districts (selected on the geographical basis) of Punjab. The data were collected by using two research instruments. A 5 -point rating scale, Causal Attribution Beliefs Scale (CABS) was used to measure causal attributions beliefs of students. Eight attributes were included in the instrument i. e. ability, effort, strategy, interest, luck, task difficulty, <b>parent.</b> <b>s</b> influence and teacher. s influence. Another instrument, a 5 -point rating scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) was used to measure self-esteem of the students. According to the nature of the data and to address the research questions, different statistical techniques i. e. inferential statistics like Independent Sample t-Tests, MANOVA, Pearson Product-Moment Correlations were applied. The results of the study revealed that students endorsed all given causes (ability, effort, strategy, interest, luck, task difficulty, <b>parent.</b> <b>s</b> influence and teacher. s influence) as a potential cause of both success and failure. Identical patterns of success were observed in mathematics and English. Both girls and boys ranked teacher. s influence, effort and <b>parent.</b> <b>s</b> influence as their prime causes of success in mathematics. Both male students and female students believe teacher. s influence, effort, parent influence and ability as the primary causes of their success in English. However, there were significant differences in failure attribution patterns. Male students consider lack of effort, lack of interest and wrong use of strategy as the main causes of their failure in mathematics. Whereas, female students considered lack of effort, wrong use of strategy and task difficulty as major causes of their failure in mathematics. In the same way, male students. main causes of failure in English were ranked as lack of interest, lack of effort and wrong use of strategy. While female students ranked failure causes in English as lack of effort, task difficulty and wrong use of strategy. Majority of the students showed high self-esteem levels. Only 14 % of the male students and 10 % of the female students exhibited low self-esteem level. Gender difference was found in self-esteem. Girls showed higher self-esteem level than boys. Similarly, urban students showed higher self-esteem level than rural students and science students showed higher self-esteem level than arts students. Relationship between causal attribution beliefs of students and self-esteem was found at secondary level. A small, negative but significant correlation was found in failure attributions and self-esteem level of the students. The relationship between failure attributions in mathematics and self-esteem was found in three attributions i. e. ability, luck and <b>parent.</b> <b>s</b> influence: whereas the relationship between failure attributions in English and self-esteem was found in five attributions i. e. ability, strategy, luck, <b>parent.</b> <b>s</b> influence and teacher. s influence. A small but positive correlation was found between success attributions and self-esteem level of the students. As far as success attributions in mathematics and self-esteem were concerned, four attributions i. e. ability, effort, interest and <b>parent.</b> <b>s</b> influence were positively correlated. Similarly, relationship between success attributions in English and self-esteem was found in six attributions i. e. ability, effort, strategy, interest, <b>parent.</b> <b>s</b> influence and teacher. s influence. Attributional patterns are changeable and can be taught to the students. The teachers should encourage their students to the attributions of controllable causes, so that changed self-perception brings academic improvement. The teacher. s feedback is very important in changing students. attributional beliefs. They must be trained in approaching their students, motivating them intrinsically and provision of suitable oral / written feedback to them so that in result students. desire to learn, to discover, to comprehend, to develop etc, can be flourished...|$|E

Exploring families who have lost a teenager will help us in obtaining a better understanding of parents perceived needs and what services are helpful and not helpful. ^ The objective of this multiple case study was to develop an understanding of families needs following the suicide of a teenager. A total of six <b>parent</b> (<b>s)</b> units living in Nebraska who have lost a teenager to suicide, were interviewed. For this study, <b>parent</b> (<b>s)</b> was defined as a single parent or married couple. It was requested that both parents participate but if only one parent was able to participate the research continued. Teenager suicide is defined as a teenager between the ages of 13 - 19 intentionally taking his/her own life. Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed for identification and review of common themes. ^ Participants in the present study indicated several key themes that describe parent 2 ̆ 7 s needs following the suicide of a teenager. These needs are: Support by listening and responding, support from another suicide survivor, support in finding direction, support in seeing the teen, support in remembering the teen, and support in giving back. ^ The research findings present implications for mental health professionals, first responders, suicide survivor intervention teams, and support networks. ...|$|E

Staphylococcus aureus mutants lacking pigment, or expressing only {{low levels}} of pigment, were more {{sensitive}} to oleic acid than were the parent strain and mutants making more pigment than the parent. One class of mutants (colour index 5), although possessing significant levels of pigment, were nevertheless quite sensitive to oleic acid. This suggested that only certain carotenoids in the biosynthetic pathway were capable of imparting resistance to fatty acids. The phenotypic expression of pigment also affected the sensitivity of a strain to oleic acid. The <b>parent</b> <b>S.</b> aureus strain 182, when grown to express its maximal pigment potential, was more resistant to oleic acid than when it was grown to express minimal levels of pigment...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} associations of family composition with morbidity and mortality; however, the evidence of associations with risk of stroke is limited. We sought to {{examine the impact of}} changes in the household composition on risk of stroke and its types in Japanese population. Cox proportional hazard modelling was used to assess the risk of incident stroke and stroke types within a cohort of 77, 001 Japanese men and women aged 45 - 74 years who experienced addition and/or loss of family members [spouse, child(ren), parent(s) and others] to their households over a five years interval (between 1990 - 1993 and 1995 - 1998). During 1, 043, 446 person-years of the follow-up for 35, 247 men and 41, 758 women, a total of 3, 858 cases of incident stroke (1485 hemorrhagic and 2373 ischemic) were documented. When compared with a stable family composition, losing at least one family member was associated with 11 - 15 % increased risk of stroke in women and men; hazard ratios (95 % confidence interval) were 1. 11 (1. 01 - 1. 22) and 1. 15 (1. 05 - 1. 26), respectively. The increased risk was associated with the loss of a spouse, and was evident for ischemic stroke in men and hemorrhagic stroke in women. The addition of any family members to the household was not associated with risk of stroke in men, whereas the addition of a <b>parent</b> (<b>s)</b> to the household was associated with increased risk in women: 1. 49 (1. 09 - 2. 28). When the loss of a spouse was accompanied by the addition of other family members to the household, the increased risk of stroke disappeared in men: 1. 18 (0. 85 - 1. 63), but exacerbated in women: 1. 58 (1. 19 - 2. 10). In conclusion, men who have lost family members, specifically a spouse have higher risk of ischemic stroke, and women who gained family members; specifically a <b>parent</b> (<b>s)</b> had the higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke than those with a stable family composition...|$|E
40|$|A {{variant of}} Staphylococcus aureus 44 A HJD was {{isolated}} by serial growth in Trypticase soy broth to which 2 M serine {{had been added}} (wt/vol). Amino acid analysis of hydrolysates of purified mucopeptides from the variant showed that they contained 1. 266 serine and 2. 156 glycine residues per glutamic acid residue, compared with 0. 174 serine and 3. 144 glycine residues per glutamic acid residue in the mucopeptide of the parent strain. In addition to this alteration in the chemical composition of the mucopeptide, the variant lost many of the biochemical and cultural characteristics of the parent organism. The variant was not sensitive to the lytic action of lysostaphin and was non-phage-typable. Moreover, in vitro tests indicated that the organism was coagulase negative, did not produce gelatinase or deoxyribonuclease, and did not hemolyze sheep erythrocytes.
