The data were the comments containing register found in the article on Allkpop. com. The researcher revealed that there were 20 kinds of register used by K- <b>Popers.</b> Those twenty (20) words are considered as register because they are only understandable by the K-Popers. The researcher also found 6 types of word formation processes in those 20 registers used by K-Popers. They are compounding, borrowing, acronym, derivation, blending and multiple processes. Besides, the researcher also revealed that the registers could undergo three kinds of semantic change. They are generalization, specialization and total semantic change. And the last the researcher also revealed the factor facilitating the semantic change of the register such as needs of the new meaning and taboo word. The researcher suggests that the other students or researchers who have the same interest in sociolinguistic especially register, morphology especially word formation process or semantic especially semantic change conduct similar study using different and wider scope of data.

The course content included several stand-up techniques such as character building, creating stand-up routines, jokes building, working with props and microphones, vocal work, body language, and communication with the public. During the course, each participant produced monologues that were later exhibited in Tecnopolis, under the name [...] "Humor Científico," [...] in 18 shows.

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} strip complex. A strip complex is a special type of complex obtained by gluing “strips ” along their natural boundaries according to a given graph structure. The most familiar example is the one dimensional complex classically associated with a graph {{in which case the}} strips are simply copies of the unit interval (our setup actually allows for variable edge length). A leading key example is treebolic space, a geometric object studied in a number of recent articles, which arises as a horocyclic product of a metric tree with the hyperbolic plane. In this case, the graph is a regular tree, the strips are [0, 1] × R, and each strip is equipped with the hyperbolic geometry of a specific strip in upper half plane. We consider natural families of Dirichlet forms on a general strip complex and show that the associated heat kernels and harmonic functions have very strong smoothness properties. We study questions such as essential selfadjointness of the underying differential operator acting on a suitable space of smooth functions satisfying a Kirchoff type condition at points where the strip complex bifurcates.

40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] composites are widely considered in structural parts. In this paper {{attention is paid to}} squeeze flow of continuous fiber laminates. In the case of unidirectional prepregs, the ply constitutive equation is modeled as a transversally isotropic fluid, that must satisfy both the fiber inextensibility as well as the fluid incompressibility. When laminate is squeezed the flow kinematics exhibits a complex dependency along the laminate thickness requiring a detailed velocity description through the thickness. In a former work the solution making use of an in-plane-out-of-plane separated representation within the PGD – <b>Poper</b> Generalized Decomposition – framework was successfully accomplished when both kinematic constraints (inextensibility and incompressibility) were introduced using a penalty formulation for circumventing the LBB constraints. However, such a formulation makes difficult the calculation on fiber tractions and compression forces, the last required in rheological characterizations. In this paper the former penalty formulation is substituted by a mixed formulation that makes use of two Lagrange multipliers, while addressing the LBB stability conditions within the separated representation framework, questions never until now addressed.
