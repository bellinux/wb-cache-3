40|$|Neurospora crassa osmo{{sensitive}} (os) mutants {{are sensitive}} to high osmolarity and therefore are unable to grow on medium containing 4 % NaCl. We found that os- 2 and os- 5 mutants were resistant to the <b>phenylpyrrole</b> <b>fungicides</b> fludioxonil and fenpiclonil. To {{understand the relationship between}} osmoregulation and fungicide resistance, we cloned the os- 2 gene by using sib selection. os- 2 encodes a putative mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase homologous to HOG 1 and can complement the osmosensitive phenotype of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae hog 1 mutant. We sequenced three os- 2 alleles and found that all of them were null with either frameshift or nonsense point mutations. An os- 2 gene replacement mutant also was generated and was sensitive to high osmolarity and resistant to <b>phenylpyrrole</b> <b>fungicides.</b> Conversely, os- 2 mutants transformed with the wild-type os- 2 gene could grow on media containing 4 % NaCl and were sensitive to <b>phenylpyrrole</b> <b>fungicides.</b> Fludioxonil stimulated intracellular glycerol accumulation in wild-type strains but not in os- 2 mutants. Fludioxonil also caused wild-type conidia and hyphal cells to swell and burst. These results suggest that the hyperosmotic stress response pathway of N. crassa is the target of <b>phenylpyrrole</b> <b>fungicides</b> and that fungicidal effects may result from a hyperactive os- 2 MAP kinase pathway...|$|E
40|$|Botrytis cinerea is {{the causal}} agent of grey mould disease {{on a wide}} variety of crop plants. It is {{relatively}} insensitive to natural and synthetic fungitoxic compounds. This thesis describes how ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters contribute to protection by actively secreting toxicants from fungal cells, acting as a firsts aid kit. The expression of twelve ABC transporters and three MFS transporters are differentially induced by plant defence compounds, antibiotics and fungicides. BcatrD can decrease sensitivity to azole fungicides, whereas BcatrB is a true multidrug transporter and can provide protection against the plant defence compounds resveratrol and eugenol, <b>phenylpyrrole</b> <b>fungicides</b> and phenazines antibiotics. By exporting resveratrol BcatrB contributes to virulence of B. cinerea on grapevine. With their ability to protect against fungicides the ABC transporters BcatrB and BcatrD can contribute to the apparent ease by which B. cinerea develops resistance against fungicides. The protection against antibiotics is a clear advantage in competition with other microorganisms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} of the present review is to analyze the molecular basis of fungicide resistance mechanism to both synthetic fungicides and the natural fungicides isothiocyanates. The review is focused mainly on Alternaria sp., but whenever available, similar studies in other fungi have been included. Fungal resistant strains to dicarboximide and <b>phenylpyrrole</b> <b>fungicides</b> {{have been found to}} contain mutations in one of the proteins involved in the signal transduction pathway that regulates the fungal response to osmotic stress. By the other hand, it was found that isothiocyanates induce enzymes like glutathione S-transferase, cyanide hydratase, heat shock proteins, membrane transporters and proteins associated with the oxidative stress response. Also, inter simple sequence repeats polymorphism was recorded {{as a response to the}} isothiocyanates treatment. The knowledge about the genetic basis of the response mechanism of Alternaria sp. to the isothiocyanates is scarce. Therefore, studies by DNA recombinant technology to analyze the fungi responses to fungicides, will allow knowing the metabolic pathways involved in the phenomena to permit the design of strategies to inhibit key reactions involved in the fungal resistance, reaching a better and sustainable funga...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory mutants of Botryotinia fuckeliana {{resistant}} to the <b>phenylpyrrole</b> <b>fungicide</b> CGA 173506 were obtained from uv irradiated or non-irradiated conidia of two sensitive strains incubated on a medium containing 1 mug ml- 1 active ingredient (a. i.) of the fungicide. Mutation rates, which were similar for the two parental strains, were 1. 4 - 1. 8 x 10 (- 4) survivors for uv-induced mutations and 2. 9 - 9 x 10 (- 5) for spontaneous mutations. The mutants showed different levels of resistance to CGA 173506, and all displayed high resistance to dicarboximide fungicides. Genetic analysis of meiotic progeny of crosses between a sample of twenty mutants and reference strains showed that in most mutants resistance to CGA 173506 {{was caused by a}} single gene, which did not recombine during meiosis with the Daf 1 gene responsible for resistance to dicarboximide fungicides. Mutant BAR 48 proved to be a heterokaryon containing nuclei carrying mutations in the Daf 1 gene, along with nuclei carrying mutations in a different gene, termed Daf 2. Most laboratory mutants selected for high resistance to dicarboximides were also {{resistant to}} CGA 173506. Field isolates with low resistance to dicarboximides were, however, all normally sensitive to the <b>phenylpyrrole</b> <b>fungicide...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{series of}} {{derivatives}} of the <b>phenylpyrrole</b> <b>fungicide</b> fenpiclonil was synthesized {{in which a}} carboxyl group was present at various sites of this non-phloem-mobile molecule. Using the Kleier model, all these acidic analogues were predicted to be moderately phloem-mobile, especially the N-substituted derivatives. One of these latter molecules, N-carboxymethyl- 3 -cyano- 4 -(2, 3 -dichlorophenyl) pyrrole, exhibited some fungicidal activity on the pathogenic fungus Eutypa lata, and was then tested as a phloem-mobile pesticide in the Ricinus system. The compound was indeed mobile in the sieve tubes and was not degraded to fenpiclonil in the phloem sap under our experimental conditions. Its concentration in the sap was closely correlated to {{the percentage of the}} undissociated form of the molecule in the external medium, and was similar under acidic conditions (external pH 4. 6 - 5. 0) to that of the herbicide glyphosate...|$|R
40|$|Isolates of Alternaria alternata {{collected}} from a field site which {{had previously been}} treated with the dicarboximide fungicide iprodione were found to demonstrate {{a high level of}} resistance to iprodione and the <b>phenylpyrrole</b> <b>fungicide,</b> fludioxonil in plate assays. In order to determine the genetic basis for this fungicide resistance a partial length clone of a two-component histidine kinase (HK) was isolated from genomic DNA of a fungicide-sensitive A. alternata isolate using degenerate primers by PCR. Analysis of the AaHK 1 gene structure indicates the presence of six 90 amino acid repeat domains upstream of a kinase domain as found in the homologous HK genes from other fungal species. Comparison of nucleic acid sequences from the fungicide-sensitive and fungicide-resistant A. alternata isolates confirmed the presence of mutations leading to premature termination of the translated HK protein. The possible role of the two-component HK in the development of dicarboximide resistance in A. alternata is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Dicarboximides and phenylpyrroles are {{commonly}} used fungicides against plant pathogenic ascomycetes. Although their effect on fungal osmosensing systems {{has been shown in}} many studies, their modes-of-action still remain unclear. Laboratory- or field-mutants of fungi resistant to either or both fungicide categories generally harbour point mutations in the sensor histidine kinase of the osmotic signal transduction cascade. In the present study we compared the mechanisms of resistance to the dicarboximide iprodione and to pyrrolnitrin, a structural analogue of <b>phenylpyrrole</b> <b>fungicides,</b> in Botrytis cinerea. Pyrrolnitrin-induced mutants and iprodione-induced mutants of B. cinerea were produced in vitro. For the pyrrolnitrin-induced mutants, a high level of resistance to pyrrolnitrin was associated {{with a high level of}} resistance to iprodione. For the iprodione-induced mutants, the high level of resistance to iprodione generated variable levels of resistance to pyrrolnitrin and phenylpyrroles. All selected mutants showed hypersensitivity to high osmolarity and regardless of their resistance levels to phenylpyrroles, they showed strongly reduced fitness parameters (sporulation, mycelial growth, aggressiveness on plants) compared to the parental phenotypes. Most of the mutants presented modifications in the osmosensing class III histidine kinase affecting the HAMP domains. Site directed mutagenesis of the bos 1 gene was applied to validate eight of the identified mutations. Structure modelling of the HAMP domains revealed that the replacements of hydrophobic residues within the HAMP domains generally affected their helical structure, probabl...|$|E
40|$|Azole-resistant mutants of Botrytis cinerea have a multidrug {{resistance}} phenotype since they exhibit cross-resistance to unrelated chemicals. These mutants also display {{resistance to the}} new azole fungicide oxpoconazole. Resistance to oxpoconazole is associated with decreased accumulation of the fungicide, {{which is the result}} of energy-dependent efflux mediated by fungicide transporters. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter BcatrB (B. cinerea ABC transporter B), involved in efflux of <b>phenylpyrrole</b> <b>fungicides,</b> has no major role in efflux of oxpoconazole since accumulation of the fungicide by a replacement mutant of BcatrB showed a transient accumulation pattern {{similar to that of the}} wild-type isolate. The putative role of 10 additional ABC and 3 Major facilitator superfamily transporters in efflux of oxpoconazole was investigated by expression analysis of the corresponding genes. The basal transcription level of BcatrD in germlings of B. cinerea was correlated with the resistance level of two azole-resistant mutants. A short treatment of germlings with the azole fungicides oxpoconazole, prochloraz, and tebuconazole enhanced transcript levels of BcatrD in a wild-type isolate. Transcript levels induced by these fungicides in azole-resistant mutants also correlated with resistance levels. We propose that BcatrD is the ABC transporter that plays a role in azole sensitivity and azole resistance of B. cinerea. Expression of BcatrD is also induced by treatment of germlings with the dicarboximide fungicide iprodione, the benzimidazole fungicide carbendazim, and the antibiotic cycloheximide, suggesting that this gene indeed plays a role in {{multidrug resistance}} to fungicides...|$|E
40|$|The {{tangerine}} pathotype of Alternaria alternata is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen causing {{brown spot}} disease {{on a number}} of citrus cultivars. To better understand the dynamics of signal regulation leading to oxidative and osmotic stress response and fungal infection on citrus, phenotypic characterization of the yeast SSK 1 response regulator homolog was performed. It was determined that SSK 1 responds to diverse environmental stimuli and plays a critical role in fungal pathogenesis. Experiments to determine the phenotypes resulting from the loss of SSK 1 reveal that the SSK 1 gene product may be fulfilling similar regulatory roles in signaling pathways involving a HOG 1 MAP kinase during ROS resistance, osmotic resistance, fungicide sensitivity and fungal virulence. The SSK 1 mutants display elevated sensitivity to oxidants, fail to detoxify H 2 O 2 effectively, induce minor necrosis on susceptible citrus leaves, and displays resistance to dicarboximide and <b>phenylpyrrole</b> <b>fungicides.</b> Unlike the SKN 7 response regulator, SSK 1 and HOG 1 confer resistance to salt-induced osmotic stress via an unknown kinase sensor rather than the "two component" histidine kinase HSK 1. SSK 1 and HOG 1 play a moderate role in sugar-induced osmotic stress. We also show that SSK 1 mutants are impaired in their ability to produce germ tubes from conidia, indicating a role for the gene product in cell differentiation. SSK 1 also is involved in multi-drug resistance. However, deletion of the yeast SHO 1 (synthetic high osmolarity) homolog resulted in no noticeable phenotypes. Nonetheless, our results show that A. alternata can sense and react to different types of stress via SSK 1, HOG 1 and SKN 7 in a cooperative manner leading to proper physiological and pathological functions...|$|E
40|$|Disruption of {{cell wall}} {{integrity}} {{system should be}} an effective strategy for control of fungal pathogens. To augment the cell wall disruption efficacy of monoterpenoid phenols (carvacrol, thymol), antimycotic potency of benzaldehyde derivatives that can serve as chemosensitizing agents were evaluated against strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild type (WT), slt 2 Δ and bck 1 Δ (mutants of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and MAPK kinase kinase, respectively, in the cell wall integrity pathway). Among fourteen compounds investigated, slt 2 Δ and bck 1 Δ showed higher susceptibility to nine benzaldehydes, compared to WT. Differential antimycotic activity of screened compounds indicated “structure-activity relationship” for targeting the cell wall integrity, where 2 -hydroxy- 4 -methoxybenzaldehyde (2 H 4 M) exhibited the highest antimycotic potency. The efficacy of 2 H 4 M as an effective chemosensitizer to monoterpenoid phenols (viz., 2 H 4 M + carvacrol or thymol) was assessed in yeasts or filamentous fungi (Aspergillus, Penicillium) according to European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing or Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute M 38 -A protocols, respectively. Synergistic chemosensitization greatly lowers minimum inhibitory or fungicidal concentrations of the co-administered compounds. 2 H 4 M also overcame the tolerance of two MAPK mutants (sakAΔ, mpkCΔ) of Aspergillus fumigatus to fludioxonil (<b>phenylpyrrole</b> <b>fungicide).</b> Collectively, 2 H 4 M possesses chemosensitizing capability to magnify the efficacy of monoterpenoid phenols, which improves target-based (viz., cell wall disruption) antifungal intervention...|$|R
40|$|We {{have shown}} that the plant {{pathogen}} Alternaria brassicicola exhibited very high susceptibility to ambruticin VS 4 {{and to a lesser extent}} to the <b>phenylpyrrole</b> <b>fungicide</b> fludioxonil. These compounds are both derived from natural bacterial metabolites with antifungal properties and are thought to exert their toxicity by interfering with osmoregulation in filamentous fungi. Disruption of the osmosensor group III histidine kinase gene AbNIK 1 (for A. brassicola NIK 1) resulted in high levels of resistance to ambruticin and fludioxonil, while a mutant isolate characterized by a single-amino-acid substitution in the HAMP domain of the kinase only exhibited moderate resistance. Moreover, the natural resistance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to these antifungal molecules switched to sensitivity in strains expressing AbNIK 1 p. We also showed that exposure to fludioxonil and ambruticin resulted in abnormal phosphorylation of a Hog 1 -like mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in A. brassicicola. Parallel experiments carried out with wild-type and mutant isolates of Neurospora crassa revealed that, in this species, ambruticin susceptibility was dependent on the OS 1 -RRG 1 branch of the phosphorelay pathway downstream of the OS 2 MAPK cascade but independent of the yeast Skn 7 -like response regulator RRG 2. These results show that the ability to synthesize a functional group III histidine kinase is a prerequisite for the expression of ambruticin and phenylpyrrole susceptibility in A. brassicicola and N. crassa and that, at least in the latter species, improper activation of the high-osmolarity glycerol-related pathway could explain their fungicidal properties...|$|R
40|$|The dimorphic ascomycete {{pathogen}} Mycosphaerella graminicola switches from a yeastlike form to {{an infectious}} filamentous form that penetrates the host foliage through stomata. We examined the biological {{function of the}} mitogenactivated protein kinase¿encoding gene MgHog 1 in M. graminicola. Interestingly, MgHog 1 mutants were unable to switch to filamentous growth on water agar that mimics the nutritionally poor conditions on the foliar surface and, hence, exclusively developed by a yeastlike budding process. Consequently, due to impaired initiation of infectious germ tubes, as revealed by detailed in planta cytological analyses, the MgHog 1 mutants failed to infect wheat leaves. We, therefore, conclude that MgHog 1 is a new pathogenicity factor involved in the regulation of dimorphism in M. graminicola. Furthermore, MgHog 1 mutants are osmosensitive, resistant to <b>phenylpyrrole</b> and dicarboximide <b>fungicides,</b> and do not melaniz...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{reported that the}} group III histidine kinase Dic 1 p in the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus is involved in resistance to dicarboximide and <b>phenylpyrrole</b> <b>fungicides</b> and in osmotic adaptation. In addition, exposure to the phenylpyrrole fungicide fludioxonil led to improper activation of Hog 1 -type mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in some phytopathogenic fungi, including C. heterostrophus. Here we report, for the first time, {{the relationship between the}} group III histidine kinase and Hog 1 -related MAPK: group III histidine kinase is a positive regulator of Hog 1 -related MAPK in filamentous fungi. The phosphorylation pattern of C. heterostrophus BmHog 1 p (Hog 1 -type MAPK) was analyzed in wild-type and dic 1 -deficient strains by Western blotting. In the wild-type strain, phosphorylated BmHog 1 p was detected after exposure to both iprodione and fludioxonil at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. In the dic 1 -deficient strains, phosphorylated BmHog 1 p was not detected after exposure to 10 μg/ml of the fungicides. In response to osmotic stress (0. 4 M KCl), a trace of phosphorylated BmHog 1 p was found in the dic 1 -deficient strains, whereas the band representing active BmHog 1 p was clearly detected in the wild-type strain. Similar results were obtained for Neurospora crassa Os- 2 p MAPK phosphorylation in the mutant of the group III histidine kinase gene os- 1. These results indicate that group III histidine kinase positively regulates the activation of Hog 1 -type MAPKs in filamentous fungi. Notably, the Hog 1 -type MAPKs were activated at high fungicide (100 μg/ml) and osmotic stress (0. 8 M KCl) levels in the histidine kinase mutants of both fungi, suggesting that another signaling pathway activates Hog 1 -type MAPKs in these conditions...|$|E
40|$|Fungal {{histidine}} kinases (HKs) {{have been}} implicated in different processes, such as the osmostress response, hyphal development, sensitivity to fungicides and virulence. Members of HK class III are known to signal through the HOG mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), but possible interactions with other MAPKs have not been explored. In this study, we have characterized fhk 1, encoding a putative class III HK from the soil-borne vascular wilt pathogen Fusarium oxysporum. Inactivation of fhk 1 resulted in resistance to <b>phenylpyrrole</b> and dicarboximide <b>fungicides,</b> as well as increased sensitivity to hyperosmotic stress and menadione-induced oxidative stress. The osmosensitivity of Δ fhk 1 mutants {{was associated with a}} striking and previously unreported change in colony morphology. The Δ fhk 1 strains showed a significant decrease in virulence on tomato plants. Epistatic analysis between Fhk 1 and the Fmk 1 MAPK cascade indicated that Fhk 1 does not function upstream of Fmk 1, but that the two pathways may interact to control the response to menadione-induced oxidative stress. © 2010 The Authors.
