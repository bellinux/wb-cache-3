50|$|Affluence and {{economic}} standing within society are often {{expressed in terms}} of <b>percentile</b> <b>ranking.</b> Economic ranking is conducted either in terms of giving lower thresholds for a designated group (e.g. the top 5%, 10%, 15%, etc.) or in terms of the percentage of households/individuals with incomes above a certain threshold (e.g. above $75,000, $100,000, $150,000, etc.). The table below presents 2006 income data in terms of the lower thresholds for the given percentages (e.g. the top 25.6% of households had incomes exceeding $80,000, compared to $47,000 for the top quarter of individuals).|$|E

40|$|Many {{commentators}} on {{neuropsychological assessment}} stress the disadvantages of expressing test {{scores in the}} form of <b>percentile</b> <b>ranks.</b> As a result, there is a danger of losing sight of the fundamentals: <b>percentile</b> <b>ranks</b> express scores in a form that is of greater relevance to the neuropsychologist than any alternative metric because they tell us directly how common or uncommon such scores are in the normative population. We advocate that, in addition to expressing scores on a standard metric, neuropsychologists should also routinely record the <b>percentile</b> <b>rank</b> of all test scores so that the latter are available when attempting to reach a formulation. In addition, it is argued that the current practice of expressing confidence limits on test scores on a standard score metric should be supplemented with confidence limits expressed as <b>percentile</b> <b>ranks,</b> because the latter provide a more direct and tangible indication of the uncertainty surrounding an observed score.

40|$|Statistical {{models of}} normal ageing brain tissue volumes may support earlier {{diagnosis}} of increasingly common, yet still fatal, neurodegenerative diseases. For example, the statistically defined distribution of normal ageing brain tissue volumes {{may be used}} as a reference to assess patient volumes. To date, such models were often derived from mean values which were assumed to represent the distributions and boundaries, i. e. <b>percentile</b> <b>ranks,</b> of brain tissue volume. Since it was previously unknown, the objective {{of the present study was}} to determine if this assumption was robust, i. e. whether regression models derived from mean values accurately represented the distributions and boundaries of brain tissue volume at older ages. We acquired T 1 -w magnetic resonance (MR) brain images of 227 normal and 219 Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects (aged 55 - 89 years) from publicly available databanks. Using nonlinear regression within both samples, we compared mean and <b>percentile</b> <b>rank</b> estimates of whole brain tissue volume by age. In both the normal and AD sample, mean regression estimates of brain tissue volume often did not accurately represent <b>percentile</b> <b>rank</b> estimates (errors=- 74 % to 75 %). In the normal sample, mean estimates generally underestimated differences in brain volume at <b>percentile</b> <b>ranks</b> below the mean. Conversely, in the AD sample, mean estimates generally underestimated differences in brain volume at <b>percentile</b> <b>ranks</b> above the mean. Differences between ages at the 5 (th) <b>percentile</b> <b>rank</b> of normal subjects were ~ 39 % greater than mean differences in the AD subjects. While more data are required to make true population inferences, our results indicate that mean regression estimates may not accurately represent the distributions of ageing brain tissue volumes. This suggests that <b>percentile</b> <b>rank</b> estimates will be required to robustly define the limits of brain tissue volume in normal ageing and neurodegenerative disease...|$|R
