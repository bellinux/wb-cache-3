25|$|The 1970s saw an {{uptick in}} OTEC {{research}} and development during the post 1973 Arab-Israeli War, which caused oil prices to triple. The U.S. federal government poured $260 million into OTEC research after President Carter signed a law that committed the US to a <b>production</b> <b>goal</b> of 10,000 MW of electricity from OTEC systems by 1999.|$|E
25|$|Parliament granted NOK1.2 {{million to}} upgrade the mines, with the company having an {{operating}} deficit of NOK2.9 million that year. A further grant of NOK1.9 million was issued the following year. The population dropped to 72 while production was halted. In 1954 there was produced 5,000 tonnes of coal, mostly for the towns own consumption. By 1955 the estimates for continuing operation, mostly prominently the need for improved ventilation systems, reached an estimate of NOK20 million. A certain amount of production was resumed, reaching 15,000 tonnes in 1955. Parliament approved a new production plan on 20 March 1956, which set a <b>production</b> <b>goal</b> of 200,000 tonnes of coal annually. The company built a new power station, bath and a fire station, as well as additional housing. Ester I was re-opened and upgraded. Production gradually increased to 47,000 in 1958, before falling again, {{in part because of}} falling coal prices.|$|E

2500|$|A {{report from}} late April 1958 stated that {{excavation}} work would hopefully begin by midyear, with 1964/1965 {{as the year}} set to bring the initial stage to completion. Plans called for three stages of construction, beginning with a 1,500 MW plant with a $320 million price tag, then twice that capacity, and eventually the 25,000 MW originally approved.

[...] An international syndicate named Aluminga, comprising a number of European and North American firms, was already organizing to realize this.

40|$|In model-based control, {{a planner}} uses a system {{description}} {{to create a}} plan that achieves <b>production</b> <b>goals</b> (Fikes & Nilsson 1971). The same description {{can be used by}} modelbased diagnosis to infer the condition of components in a system from partially informative sensors. Prior work has demonstrated that diagnosis can be used to adapt the control of a system to changes in its components. However diagnosis must either make inferences from passive observations of production, or production must be halted to take diagnostic actions. We observe that the declarative nature of model-based control allows the planner to achieve <b>production</b> <b>goals</b> in multiple ways. This flexibility can be exploited with a novel paradigm we call pervasive diagnosis which produces diagnostic production plans that simultaneously achieve <b>production</b> <b>goals</b> while uncovering additional information about component health. We present an efficient heuristic search for these diagnostic production plans and show through experiments on a model of an industrial digital printing press that the theoretical increase in information can be realized on practical real-time systems.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} a new {{approach}} is presented to solve multi-objective production scheduling and rescheduling problems. Furthermore the relationship between <b>production</b> <b>goals</b> and heuristic solving methods in an extended flexible flow shop environment is also investigated. We define <b>production</b> <b>goals</b> by specifying objective functions and apply special production constraints for the extended flow shop scheduling model. We focus on creating near-optimal feasible schedule considering multiple objectives. The proposed method {{is based on the}} well-known tabu search meta-heuristic. Moreover we use an advanced structure of the tabu list, new relational and neighbourhood operators for multi-objective aim. At the end we present some computational experiments on small and large size problem instances...|$|R

40|$|Ever-increasing energy demands, {{volatile}} petroleumprices, {{and growing}} concerns {{about climate change}} have spurred worldwide interest in alternatives to fossil fuels. Biofuels, or fuels produced from biomass, have become {{a major focus of}} attention, because they represent a potential means of both reducing dependence on fossil fuels and lowering net emissions of atmospheric CO 2 (Fargione et al. 2008; Charles 2009). In the US, legisla-tion has stimulated rapid expansion of biofuel production by subsidizing producers and refiners, enacting tariffs on imports, and requiring benchmark <b>production</b> <b>goals</b> (US Congress 2007).

40|$|Abstract—In model-based production, {{a planner}} uses a system {{description}} to create plans that achieve <b>production</b> <b>goals.</b> The same description {{can be used}} by model-based diagnosis to infer the condition of components from sensor data. When production is realized by a sequence of plans, prior work has demonstrated that diagnosis can be used to adapt the plans to compensate for component degradation. However, the sources of diagnostic infor-mation are severely limited. Diagnosis must either make inferences from observations during production over which it has no control (passive diagnosis), or production must be halted to introduce diagnostic-specific plans (explicit diagnosis). We observe that the declarative nature of the model-based approach allows the planner to achieve <b>production</b> <b>goals</b> in multiple ways. This flexibility is exploited by a novel paradigm, i. e., pervasive (active) diagnosis, which constructs informative production plans that simultaneously achieve <b>production</b> <b>goals</b> while uncovering additional diagnostic information about the condition of components. We present an efficient heuristic search for these informative production plans and show through experiments on a model of an industrial digital printing press that the theoretical increase in long-run productiv-ity can be realized on practical real-time systems. We obtain higher long-run productivity than a decoupled combination of planning and diagnosis. Index Terms—Active probing, control, diagnosis, model-based reasoning, planning, scheduling. I...|$|R
