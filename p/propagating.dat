40|$|Abstract: Thermal {{effects on}} Rayleigh wave speed in {{transversely}} isotropic medium are studied. A formula for the speed is derived {{first time in}} the said material. The speed of waves in some model transversely isotropic materials is calculated and is compared with the speed of the waves which <b>propagate</b> without thermal effects. It is observed that two Rayleigh waves <b>propagate</b> in the material under thermal effect.

5|$|A {{political}} party {{known as the}} South Indian Libertarian Federation (commonly referred to as Justice Party) was founded in 1916, principally to oppose {{the economic and political}} power of the Brahmin groups. The party's goal was to render social justice to the non-Brahmin groups. To gain the support of the masses, non-Brahmin politicians began <b>propagating</b> an ideology of equality among non-Brahmin castes. Brahmanical priesthood and Sanskritic social class-value hierarchy were blamed for the existence of inequalities among non-Brahmin caste groups.|$|E
5|$|As {{its name}} implies, the mistle thrush is {{important}} in <b>propagating</b> the mistletoe, an aerial parasite, which needs its seeds to be deposited on the branches of suitable trees.

50|$|Plants may be <b>propagated</b> by seeds, {{but often}} {{desirable}} cultivars are <b>propagated</b> asexually. The most common method is by cuttings. These {{can be taken}} from shoot tips or parts of stems with a node (softwood cuttings) or from older stems (hardwood cuttings). Herbaceous perennials are also often <b>propagated</b> by root cuttings or division. For plants on a rootstock grafting or budding is used. Older techniques like layering are sometimes used for crops which are difficult to <b>propagate.</b>|$|R

'Peter Star' mutants through mutagenesis could recover pollen viability. When both parents were <b>propagated</b> by tissue culture, fruit set increased compared to when one or both parents were <b>propagated</b> by cuttings.

5|$|In the 1990s, several theorists {{generalized}} Montonen–Olive duality to the S-duality relationship, which connects different string theories. Ashoke Sen studied S-duality in {{the context}} of heterotic strings in four dimensions. Chris Hull and Paul Townsend showed that type IIB string theory with a large coupling constant is equivalent via S-duality to the same theory with small coupling constant. Theorists also found that different string theories may be related by T-duality. This duality implies that strings <b>propagating</b> on completely different spacetime geometries may be physically equivalent.|$|E
5|$|In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one considers, in {{addition}} to a theory of quantum gravity, a certain kind of quantum field theory called a conformal field theory. This is a particularly symmetric and mathematically well behaved type of quantum field theory. Such theories are often studied in the context of string theory, where they are associated with the surface swept out by a string <b>propagating</b> through spacetime, and in statistical mechanics, where they model systems at a thermodynamic critical point.|$|E
