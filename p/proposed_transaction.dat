40|$|Abstract—We have {{investigated}} the performance characteristics of hardware transactional memory (HTM) on the BlueGene/Q computer in comparison with conventional concurrency control mechanisms, using a molecular dynamics application as an example. Benchmark tests, along with overhead-cost and scalability analysis, quantify relative performance advantages of HTM over other mechanisms. We found that the bookkeeping cost of HTM is high but that the rollback cost is low. We <b>propose</b> <b>transaction</b> fusion and spatially-compact scheduling techniques to reduce the overhead of HTM with minimal programming. A strong scalability benchmark shows that the fused HTM has the shortest runtime among various concurrency control mechanisms without extra memory. Based on the performance characterization, we derive a decision tree in the concurrencycontrol design space for multithreading application.

For overnight acquisition announcements, we find that cash payment offers positively and significantly affect acquisition premiums and target returns, yet these results do not hold for daytime announcements. Cash payment offers made during nontrading hours are more likely to deter potential bidders and complete <b>proposed</b> <b>transactions.</b> However, we find no such relationship for daytime announcements. These findings suggest that the timing of acquisition announcements by bidders is important for assessing the effects of payment method as a signal of target valuation and a preemption of competing bids.
