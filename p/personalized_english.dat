40|$|This {{paper has}} {{developed}} an online <b>personalized</b> <b>English</b> learning recommender system capable of providing ESL students with reading lessons that suit their different interests and therefore increase the motivation to learn. The system, using content-based analysis, collaborative filtering, and data mining techniques, analyzes real students ’ reading data and generates recommender scores, based on which to help select appropriate lessons for respective students. Its performance having been tracked {{over a period of}} one year, this recommender system has proved to be very useful in heightening ESL learners ’ motivation and interest in reading...|$|E
40|$|As {{a nearly}} global language, English as a Foreign Language (EFL) {{programs}} {{are essential for}} people wishing to learn English. Researchers have noted that extensive reading is {{an effective way to}} improve a person's command of English. Choosing suitable articles in accordance with a learner's needs, interests and ability using an e-learning system requires precise learner profiles. This paper proposes a <b>personalized</b> <b>English</b> article recommending system, which uses accumulated learner profiles to choose appropriate English articles for a learner. It employs fuzzy inference mechanisms, memory cycle updates, learner preferences and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to help learners improve their English ability in an extensive reading environment. By using fuzzy inferences and personal memory cycle updates, it is possible to find an article best suited for both a learner’s ability and her/his need to review vocabulary. After reading an article, a test is immediately provided to enhance a learner’s memory for the words newly learned in the article. The responses of tests can be used to explicitly update memory cycles of the newly-learned vocabulary. In addition, this paper proposes a methodology that also implicitly modifies memory cycles of words that were learned before. By intensively reading articles recommended through the proposed approach, learners comprehend new words quickly and review words that they knew implicitly as well, thereby efficiently improving their vocabulary volume...|$|E

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} (e. g., Benson and Chik, 2010; Sockett, 2014) suggest {{that as a}} result of changes in {{technology}} and the concomitant emergence of a globalized culture, highly effective out-of-class, informal English acquisition is becoming more common. The present study compared high-level, well-motivated Central Brazilian classroom-trained learners (CTLs) with fully autonomous self-instructed learners (FASILs) of similar backgrounds. Using linguistic tests, a questionnaire and a structured interview, the study analysed group differences as well as individual differences in language proficiency, learner histories, behaviour, beliefs, and attitudes. The key research question asked whether there existed, in more than rare circumstances, FASILs who attained levels of proficiency at least as high as highly-motivated, well-trained CTLs? Furthermore, if the knowledge and skills of FASILs were, in some respects, superior to those of CTLs, what variables accounted for the advantage? FASILs significantly outperformed CTLs across a battery of linguistic tests measuring a range of knowledge and skills. Test results indicated that while CTLs tended to plateau at upper intermediate levels, FASILs generally improved through advanced levels, often achieving native-like levels of knowledge and use. The strongest contributing factor to proficiency was found to be self-determined motivation driven by a <b>personalized</b> relationship with <b>English</b> often marked by a transnational identity. The evidence suggests this type of motivation, significantly more associated with FASILs than CTLs, led users to engage deeply with the linguistic details of informal sources. The findings challenge dominant paradigms in several fields of SLA which prioritize expert regulation over independent discovery and controlled, collaborative environments over real-world contexts of use entered into for personal reasons. A hoped for consequence of this study is that SLA research and teaching practice will begin to recognize and promote rather than regulate or dismiss the unique learning arcs that more and more English learners experience in their everyday lives. </p...|$|R
