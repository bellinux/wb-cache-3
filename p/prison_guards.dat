5|$|Initial police {{speculation}} {{was that}} Kinne had bribed guards {{to look the}} other way while she escaped the prison—an unusual blackout had been reported at the prison on the evening of and at the approximate time of her escape, and investigation showed that a door that should have been locked had been left unsecured—but further questioning of <b>prison</b> <b>guards</b> and administration showed that oversight at the prison was generally lax and that it was staffed by fewer guards than it should have been. News reports of the time reported numerous theories about Kinne's escape, including that she had bribed <b>prison</b> <b>guards,</b> that she may have enlisted the help of a supposed boyfriend who was a Mexico City policeman, that Kinne's mother had been involved in the escape plan, that a former Mexican secret service agent had assisted in her escape, and that Kinne may have disguised herself as a man to effect her escape. A more modern theory speculates that the family of Francisco Parades Ordoñez had helped her escape and then killed her.|$|E

The photos showed slash marks all over Saqer's back and other signs of physical abuse, and were also stated to be accurate by an HRW researcher who had seen the body prior to burial.

5|$|Despite a rivalry, Aubame and M'ba, now the President of Gabon, formed several {{political}} unions {{which were}} sufficiently politically balanced {{to appeal to}} the electorate. In appreciation for his help, M'ba appointed Aubame as foreign minister and later President of the Supreme Court. Tensions soon rose between the two due to Aubame's refusal to merge his party with M'ba's and create a one-party state. Aubame was installed as President of Gabon during a 1964 coup d'état against M'ba. However, the coup was toppled three days later, and although he did not participate in the coup's planning, Aubame was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor and 10 years of exile. He was beaten almost daily by his <b>prison</b> <b>guards</b> while serving out his sentence. M'ba's successor as President, Omar Bongo, allowed the return of Aubame to Gabon in 1972. The elder politician died in 1989 in Gabon's capital of Libreville.|$|E
5|$|Giuseppe Elia Pace, an {{advocate}} and {{close friend of}} Mikiel Anton Vassalli, {{was found guilty of}} treason during the reign of de Rohan and was sentenced for flogging in Valletta followed by a permanent exile out of Malta. Vassalli was imprisoned at the Klistanija {{at the end of the}} rule of the Order of St. John, and was accused of plotting revolutionary ideas during the magistracy of Grand Master Hompesch. Vassalli denied the accusations and remained imprisoned. Meanwhile, he received visits from the father of Fortunato Panzavecchia. While dining together around a table with <b>prison</b> <b>guards,</b> Panzavecchia took notes from conversations he had with Vassalli. These notes shed more light on the life of Vassalli, who after his death became the national Maltese linguistic. Though given a life sentence, he either managed to escape or was released after the expulsion of the Order from Malta.|$|E

5|$|The {{costs of}} keeping the women imprisoned in the tolbooth at Pittenweem were {{becoming}} prohibitive; on 12 August, after payment of five hundred marks, all the women except Cornfoot were released on bail. In September Morton was summoned to give evidence to the Privy Council but he had fully regained his health and displayed no symptoms of being possessed. Adam was questioned by the Privy Council in October and freed. In November, Laing, Lawson, Horsefoot and Wallace were released after paying a fine of £8 each; but {{the last of the}} accused, Cornfoot, was kept in solitary confinement in the tolbooth by Cowper. One of the <b>prison</b> <b>guards,</b> who perhaps felt sorry for her, put her in a cell with a window low enough for her to escape so she also gained her freedom.|$|E
5|$|There is {{uncertainty}} about the exact date of his death. The most common account is that he {{died of natural causes}} in 1945 while serving his sentence at Ucciardone prison in Palermo. Italian author Petacco found evidence for his 1972 book on Joe Petrosino that Cascioferro may have died of dehydration in the summer of 1943. According to Petacco, Cascioferro was left behind in his cell by <b>prison</b> <b>guards</b> while other inmates were evacuated in advance of the Allied invasion of Sicily. However, according to historian Giuseppe Carlo Marino, Cascioferro was transferred to another prison in Pozzuoli in 1940, and the octogenarian was left to die during an Allied bombardment of that prison in 1943 (other sources mention 1942). According to La Stampa, Cascioferro died on September 20, 1943, in the prison on the island of Procida.|$|E
5|$|Civilians in Masan posed an {{unexpectedly}} dangerous {{problem for the}} UN forces. The town had a large community of Communist sympathizers and agents. At {{the peak of the}} North Korean offensive, Han Gum Jo, manager of the Masan branch of the Korean Press Association, confessed that he was chief of the South Korean Labor Party in Masan and that he had been funneling information to the North Koreans through a Pusan headquarters. Additionally, the chief of the Masan <b>prison</b> <b>guards</b> was found to be the head of a Communist cell that included seven of his subordinates. This, and other counterintelligence information, came to light {{at a time when the}} most intense fighting was in progress only a few miles away. Kean considered the situation so dangerous that he ordered Masan evacuated of all people except police, public officials, railroad and utility workers, and necessary laborers and their families. Evacuation was to be completed in five days. On September 10 and 11 alone the 25th Division evacuated more than 12,000 people by Landing Ship Tank (LST) from Masan.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{few times}} a federal court was asked to {{invalidate}} a law or action on Third Amendment grounds was in Engblom v. Carey (1982). In 1979, prison officials in New York organized a strike; they were evicted from their prison facility residences, which were reassigned to members of the National Guard who had temporarily taken their place as <b>prison</b> <b>guards.</b> The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled: (1) that the term owner in the Third Amendment includes tenants (paralleling similar cases regarding the Fourth Amendment, governing search and seizure), (2) National Guard troops count as soldiers {{for the purposes of the}} Third Amendment, and (3) that the Third Amendment is incorporated (that is, that it applies to the states) by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case was remanded to the district court, which dismissed the case on the grounds that state officials could not have been aware of this interpretation.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 25 July, {{information}} arrived at Arrah that a disturbance {{was to be expected}} in the district. Wake had been told by a railway engineer stationed nearby that the boats used to cross the Son River would be destroyed; when Wake was informed {{on the morning of the}} 26th that the mutineers were crossing the river, he realised that the boats had in fact not been destroyed as promised. Wake, who had no information about the number of mutinying sepoys and other forces approaching Arrah, noted that the local police force had disappeared and he decided not to abandon the town. Eighteen civilians and fifty members of the Bengal Military Police Battalion moved into Boyle's fortified building and bricked themselves up inside. The building had stores of food, drink and ammunition (with gunpowder and lead to make more if required), entrenching tools and weapons the men had brought with them. The supplies were thought to be sufficient for a few days and, since they expected the mutineers to be followed by pursuing forces, the men anticipated a brief siege of no more than 48 hours. Throughout the entire siege Wake kept a diary by writing on the walls of the building so there would be a record of events if the besieged party did not survive. On the morning of 27 July the mutineers, joined by Kunwar Singh and his forces, arrived in Arrah. They released the prisoners from the jail and, joined by its guards, looted the treasury of 85,000 rupees. The mutineers and rebels (including the <b>prison</b> <b>guards)</b> then surrounded the house with drums and bugles playing, arranged themselves into formation and charged. When the mutineers were within 100 yards the men inside opened fire on them, killing eighteen instantly and forcing the rest to stop their charge and take shelter behind the surrounding trees and buildings.|$|E
