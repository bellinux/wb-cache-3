40|$|International {{audience}}   This work {{focuses on}} the problem of managing an energy aware resilient network. A network and a set of available links are given. A set of demands have to be routed and must be protected against single edge failure. Share protection mechanism is considered: for each demand, a primary and a edge-disjoint backup path are provided. Backup paths are used only when a failure occurs. As failures are quickly restored, edges used only by backup paths are active for short periods. Energy consumption is due only to edges used by primary paths, but both primary and backup path contribute to link capacity consumption. The problems asks to route all the demands with the aim of minimizing the overall link device energy consumption. We model the problem with two formulations: a formulation including primary and backup routing variables, and a <b>projected</b> <b>formulation</b> including only primary paths, and we propose valid inequalities for both. We compare three solution strategies: complete formulation solved by CPLEX used as stand-alone solver, complete <b>formulation</b> and <b>projected</b> <b>formulation,</b> both with cut generation. We tested the strategies on two sets of instances. Results show that the <b>projected</b> <b>formulation</b> outperforms the others on both sets of instances. </p...|$|R

Regarding the SUSY Laughlin wavefunction as a master wavefunction, Laughlin and Moore-Read states appear as two extreme limits of component wavefunctions. Realizations of topological excitations on Laughlin and Moore-Read states are also discussed in the SUSY formalism. We develop a streographically <b>projected</b> <b>formulation</b> of the SUSY quantum Hall effect. With appropriate interpretation of Grassmann odd coordinates, we illustrate striking analogies between SUSY quantum Hall effect and superfluidity. Comment: 5 pages, 1 figure, typos fixe...|$|R

For each demand, an edge-disjoint pair of paths (primary and backup) must be provided and the shared protection scheme is used. The energy consumption is due only to edges used in the no-fault scenario, but both primary and backup paths contribute to capacity consumption. We propose a <b>projected</b> <b>formulation</b> for the problem and show its effectiveness by comparing it with the complete formulation. We propose valid inequalities for both formulations.

40|$|In this study, the River Ethiope was {{critically}} {{studied as}} a source of renewable energy for small hydropower development. The aim was to carry out detailed evaluation of the river’s hydropower generation potential using RETScreen software. Data on daily flow that was used for flow duration curve was obtained from the Benin Owena River Basin Authority’s hydrological year book for a period of six years (1989 – 1994). Also in this study, meteorological data on rainfall, temperature, wind evaporation and humidity were obtained from the Meteorological Weather Station at the Geography Department, Delta State University, Abraka. These data were used to observe the seasonal variations and how this variation affects the flow rate. RETScreen clean energy analysis software was used for the evaluation of the energy output from the River Ethiope. Four alternative <b>project</b> <b>formulations</b> were evaluated using the RETScreen software. The results of the four alternative <b>project</b> <b>formulations</b> using the RETScreen Software are as follows: Case 1 (for a flow rate of Q = 9. 6 m 3 /s, with a head of 5, 10, 15 and 20 m, the output power P are: 357, 753, 1142 and 1, 526 kW respectively), Case 2 (for a flow rate of Q = 10. 8 m 3 /s, with a head of 5, 10, 15 and 20 m, the output power P are: 402, 848, 1, 286, 1, 719 kW respectively), Case 3 (for a flow rate of Q = 13. 8 m 3 /s, with a head of 5, 10, 15 and 20 m, the output power P are: 516, 1, 086, 1, 646, 2, 200 kW respectively), Case 4 (for a flow rate of Q = 31. 73 m 3 /s, with a head of 5, 10, 15 and 20 m, the output power P are: 1, 195, 2, 509, 3, 800 and 5, 079 kW respectively). The results of the evaluations showed that the River Ethiope is capable of generating 1. 20 MW on a design flow of 31. 73 m 3 /s and a head of 5 m. While on a design flow of 31. 73 m 3 /s and a head of 15 m, 3. 8 MW of electricity could be generated if properly harnessed. It can therefore be concluded that the River Ethiope when fully utilised could generate electric power capable of satisfying part of the power need of the surrounding communities...|$|R

However, the government of Nepal enunciated environment conservation relatedpolicies in the seventh plan (NPC, 1985-1990). To enforce this policy and make necessary arrangements, a series of guidelines were developed, thereby incorporating the elements of environmental factors right from the <b>project</b> <b>formulation</b> stage of the development plansand projects and to avoid or minimize adverse effects on the ecological system.

50|$|Whereas {{the formal}} {{agreements}} between Kenya and the World Bank were signed in June 1977 the implementation was delayed {{due to a}} number of factors. Firstly Kenya and the consultants needed about 10 months before they could agree on a new consultancy contract. The outcome of these negotiations was that the consultancy cost almost doubled. Secondly, during the preparation of the final designs, major modifications were made by the consultants on both the intake and the irrigation structure. These changes caused not only new delays, but also, for instance, an increase of concrete structures in the main canal with 138%, stone pitching with 338% and digging with 255%. In 1979 the World Bank concluded that both the original design of Ilaco and MacDonald’s design were based on sound engineering principles. Rejection of the new design would have resulted in further delays and fearing further delays the World Bank accepted the new design. According to the World Bank, however, design changes would result in a cost increase of 65% in real terms. At that time the economic rate of return of the project was at best 4%. Also one of the financiers (CDC) withdrew {{and as a result of}} this the part to be financed by Kenya, depending on the <b>project</b> <b>formulation,</b> increased to between 50 and 65% in real terms of the total project cost.|$|E
5000|$|In Colombia {{the words}} in Spanish [...] "Profesor/Profesora" [...] are used indistinctly for {{teachers}} at primary or secondary schools (synonym of [...] "maestra/maestro, docente) or university professors. However there is the more specific designation as university professor [...] "profesor universitario" [...] or [...] "docente universitario". The current government regulation for university professor is by a national law, decree 1279 of 2002. [...] In that law, the complete conditions, scales and degrees, as well as salary calculations for university professors are regulated. To be selected as university professor requires to apply to a public open call, containing requirements inside the institution and the experience profile of the candidate must be the one matching best. The process to evaluate, review and select from the total applicants from a competitive basis is performed by a commissioned university council consisting of university professors, and includes several tests in research <b>project</b> <b>formulation,</b> teaching tests and CV and interview evaluation. Briefly, there are four main scales for such permanent positions, as direct tenure employees, and public servants of a particular legal status inside the State contracting rules: auxiliary professor (Professor Auxiliar), assistant professor (Professor Assistante), associate professor (Professor Asociado) and full professor (Professor Titular), the highest professorship position considered in the Colombian public system, usually conferred to an individual with a long verifiable experience as a researcher or as a university professor, usually an academic with the highest postgraduate education title available in the university system (Doctor), equivalent to a doctoral degree such Ph.D. (USA) or Doktor (Germany); more than 10 years of certified teaching at university level, or equivalent time of recognized scientific work and production. Given {{the large amount of}} private universities in the country, those institutions hire new professors following many of the rules set in this public law for scale and salary calculations. There are university professors contracted per hours [...] "docente ocasional, supernumerario, o visitante" [...] to teach specific courses, similarly to lecturers, and while they may have the high qualifications and perform eventually research activities, they are not official employees of the institution and they do not have proper welfare working conditions, pension costs covered or hours for class preparation financed.|$|E
