We retrieve obvious <b>positive-negative-positive</b> patterns of gradient changes for both results in Figure  6 d,e, with peak-to-peak ranges of ‘+ 1.7 to − 2.3 to + 0.8 ’[*]×[*] 10 − 13  s− 2 and ‘+ 1.8 to − 2.2 to + 0.8 ’[*]×[*] 10 − 13  s− 2, respectively. The <b>positive-negative-positive</b> spatial pattern agrees well with the model prediction for northern gravity gradient changes in Figure  3 a. We also provide the northern gravity gradient changes from GRACE data set 1 month before the earthquake (February 2011), which are supposed not to contain the coseismic signals. The results with 300  km Gaussian smoothing only are shown in Figure  6 f. The gradient changes of February 2011 range relatively smaller than those of April 2011, from − 0.7 to + 0.7 [*]×[*] 10 − 13  s− 2, and do not show any obvious <b>positive-negative-positive</b> pattern around the fault plane. The peak-to-peak range of gradient changes for the February 2011 field probably imply the variation level from the unfiltered GRACE stripe errors {{as well as other}} land and oceanic mass-change effects in the region, which is significantly under the <b>positive-negative-positive</b> amplitude of signals detected from the April 2011 field. This demonstrates that the coseismic northern gravity-gradient changes are well detectable using only 1 -month GRACE solution after the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake and also verifies the conclusions of the synthetic test.|$|E

In this study, we reveal co-seismic signals {{of the two}} combined earthquakes, the 2006 Mw 8. 3 thrust and 2007 Mw 8. 1 normal fault earthquakes of the central Kuril Islands from GRACE observations. We compute monthly full gravitational gradient tensor in the local north-east-down frame for Kuril Islands earthquakes without spatial averaging and de-striping filters. Some of gravitational gradient components (e. g. ΔVxx, ΔVxz) enhance high frequency components of the earth gravity field and reveal more details in spatial and temporal domain. Therefore, co-seismic activity can be better illustrated. For the first time, we show that the <b>positive-negative-positive</b> co-seismic ΔVxx due to the Kuril Islands earthquakes ranges from − 0. 13 to + 0. 11 milli Eötvös, and ΔVxz shows a <b>positive-negative-positive</b> pattern ranges from − 0. 16 to + 0. 13 milli Eötvös, agree well with seismic model predictions...|$|E

30|$|With only 1 -month GRACE data of April 2011, we {{retrieve}} the coseismic gravitational signals of Tohoku-Oki earthquake using the northern gravity gradient approach. The extracted northern gravity gradient changes show obvious <b>positive-negative-positive</b> spatial pattern that {{agrees with the}} model prediction. Even though there are slight amplitude discrepancies between the GRACE observation and model prediction probably due to unfiltered stripe errors as well as fault slip model uncertainties, the detection shows a successful example with only 1 -month data and well demonstrates the potential of northern gradient approach to retrieve coseismic signals. Given the postseismic deformation that is particularly evident at large scale (which has been discussed in the above section), the detection of coseismic deformation immediately after the rupture is important. Therefore, the northern gradient approach could be {{an effective way to}} process GRACE data and analyze large earthquake deformation.|$|E

The reduction in amplitude for the signal retrieval possibly attributes to the influence of residual stripes in the monthly GRACE data, as only 1 -month data set is used for the signal extraction and thus the SNR is relatively weaker compared with that from series of data sets. One should also {{keep in mind that the}} northern gradient approach could only suppress (or reduce) stripe errors rather than completely remove them. Moreover, the uncertainty of the fault slips employed for the dislocation model prediction would also contribute to the discrepancies between the GRACE-observed and model-predicted coseismic gravitational changes.|$|E

Nevertheless, the northern gravity gradient approach provides a good means to suppress stripe errors and extract coseismic signals from GRACE observations. The <b>positive-negative-positive</b> pattern in northern gradient changes could better capture the coseismic signals than the negative-positive pattern from gravity changes. Therefore, to retrieve the coseismic variations using monthly GRACE solutions, we suggest using the northern gradient approach and employing the spatial averaging (e.g., Gaussian smoothing) only without destriping. This recommended gradient approach especially applies for the case of detecting coseismic gravitational changes with a time span of limited length (e.g., a few months or even only 1 month after the earthquake).|$|E

The external positivity reached a maximum prior to the internally recorded potential and {{was followed by a}} small late negativity. Small movements away from active synaptic sites resulted in <b>positive-negative-positive</b> potential sequences characteristic of activity and propagation. Since the external potential is a function of membrane current, the absence of negativity associated with the rising phase of the spike indicates the absence of inward current at synaptic sites. Thus, the synaptic membrane appears not to be excited by a depolarization of the magnitude of an action potential. In an Appendix it is shown that the late negativity and earlier maximum of the external potential can be accounted for by capacitative current through passive membrane...|$|E

As {{a result of the}} suppressing effect of the northern gravity gradient changes on the north-south stripes, the signals in Figure  4 d are less contaminated by stripes than those in Figure  4 b. Since GRACE observations are of anisotropic sensitivity due to the along-orbit measurements of the two near-polar-orbit satellites, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the longitudinal direction should be higher (Li and Shen 2011).

The differences of summer precipitation modes of the empirical orthogonal function and the bias of atmospheric circulations over EA-NWP are analyzed to determine the reason for the precipitation prediction errors. Results indicate that the BCC_CSM could not reproduce the <b>positive-negative-positive</b> meridional tripole pattern from south to north that differs markedly from that observed over the last 20 years. This failure {{can be attributed to the}} bias of the BCC_CSM hindcasts of the summer EAP teleconnection and the low predictability of 500 hPa at the mid-high latitude lobe of the EAP. Meanwhile, the BCC_CSM hindcasts' deficiencies of atmospheric responses to SST anomalies over the Indonesia maritime continent (IMC) resulted in opposite and geographically shifted geopotential anomalies at 500 hPa as well as wind and vorticity anomalies at 850 hPa, rendering the BCC_CSM unable to correctly reproduce the EAP teleconnection pattern.

This phenomenon, called cooperativity, {{is caused by}} the interaction of the receptor subunits. By using a complex Markovian model and a set of parameters determined previously, we analyzed how the successive binding of four ligands leads to a complex cooperative interaction of the subunits in homotetrameric HCN 2 pacemaker channels. The individual steps in the model were characterized by Gibbs free energies for the equilibria and activation energies, specifying the affinity of the binding sites and the transition rates, respectively. Moreover, cooperative free energies were calculated for each binding step in both the closed and the open channel. We show that the cooperativity sequence <b>positive-negative-positive</b> determined for the binding affinity is generated by the combined effect of very different cooperativity sequences determined for the binding and unbinding rates, which are negative-negative-positive and no-negative-no, respectively. It is concluded that in the ligand-induced activation of HCN 2 channels, the sequence of cooperativity based on the binding affinity is caused by two even qualitatively different sequences of cooperativity that are based on the rates of ligand binding and unbinding...|$|E

30|$|It is {{generally}} believed that excessive rainfall {{often results in}} floods, while the long-term lack of rain can lead to droughts. Large-scale droughts and floods may bring severe damage to agricultural and industrial activities. Floods can last for several months, such as the severe floods of the Yangtze River in 1991, 1996, and 1998 (Zhai et al. 2005). Compared to floods, droughts can last for a longer time, even more than 1  year, such as the extreme drought over southeastern China that persisted for 24  months during 2003 to 2005, making it the worst drought since 1960 (Lin et al. 2012). Precipitation is the dominant parameter affecting drought and flood events. Investigations have found that northern China has become increasingly drier, while in central China, rainfall {{has been on the}} rise (Lei and Duan 2011). In eastern China, there has been more rainfall over the Yangtze River valley and less over the Yellow River and Huai River valleys in recent decades, which indicates that the rainy belt is shifting from north to south over eastern China. Moreover, the decadal variation of precipitation also shows a <b>positive-negative-positive</b> pattern over eastern China, which means that when there is a wetter period in the Yangtze River valley, there is a drier period in both northern and southeastern China (Zhao and Zhou 2006; Ding 2007).|$|E

40|$|Seasonal (three-month average) climate {{forecasts}} {{have advanced}} {{due in large}} part to improved modeling of the ENSO phenomenon. Long-range monthly forecasts are more problematic because of internal atmospheric variability. Further, it is often assumed that monthly precipitation anomalies are representative of the overall seasonal anomaly. This is not always the case as, according to the Global Precipitation Climatology Project Version 2. 1 data set, up to 20 % of areas demonstrating some significant teleconnection to ENSO show El Niño minus La Niña differences of one sign in the middle month and the opposite sign in the adjacent months. Most interestingly, this maximum percentage occurs in December-January-February (DJF), a time when the ENSO boundary forcing is strongest. These oscillatory DJF seasons also cluster in space- with significant <b>positive-negative-positive</b> differences in the western South Tropical Indian Ocean (STIO) and negative-positive-negative differences in the far eastern STIO. Representative gauges confirm that these precipitation patterns have been associated with ENSO events since 1951, and pentad precipitation data confirm that they are confined to DJF and evolve at the monthly scale. The abrupt end of the Indian Ocean Dipole mode in January, an increase in the importance of local SST anomalies in February, and an ENSO-induced mid-latitude Rossby wave during austral summer combine to generate the cross-basin precipitation gradient around 15 °S...|$|E
30|$|GRACE level 2 data {{released}} with monthly spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients are contaminated by north-south stripe errors, and the stripe errors are related with the correlated errors among the SH coefficients (Swenson and Wahr 2006). To suppress the correlated errors, a high-pass filter is usually designed by fitting the coefficients with polynomials, {{which is considered}} as destriping. Chen et al. (2007) and Heki and Matsuo (2010) used a filter including destriping first and then spatial averaging to reduce noises and retrieve seismic signals associated with large earthquakes. Several other previous studies also employed destriping to extract the coseismic gravitational changes due to 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake (e.g., Matsuo and Heki 2011; Zhou et al. 2012). Nevertheless, destriping would distort and reduce real signals while suppressing stripes. Li and Shen (2011) found that the horizontal components of gravity gradient changes exhibit <b>positive-negative-positive</b> features due to the mass variations of a large thrusting earthquake and recommended a northern (latitude-direction) gravity gradient approach to detect the coseismic effects more efficiently due to the anisotropic sensitivity of GRACE observations. Later, Wang et al. (2012 b) demonstrated the potential of gravity gradient approach in a more general sense. So far, GRACE observations have been applied to constrain fault slip models with large-scale gravity changes, but mostly from the direct use of level 1 B (range and range-rate) data (e.g., Han et al. 2010, 2011, 2013). For the potential application of GRACE level 2 monthly solutions to constrain fault slips (which {{would be much more}} convenient by the simple processing of SH coefficients, if possible), it is essential to suppress stripe errors and retrieve true signals as much as possible for the observations.|$|E

Inconsistent with its subcortical source however, the signal {{was found to}} be tightly localised to the mastoid. This thesis re-examines the earlier protocols using flash stimulation and with auditory masking establishes by topographic studies that the VESP has a widespread scalp distribution, consistent with a far-field source of the signal, and is not a volume-conducted electroretinogram (ERG). Furthermore, mastoid localisation indicates auditory contamination from the click, on discharge of the photostimulator. The use of flash stimulation could not precisely identify the origin of the response. Possible sources of the VESP are the lateral geniculate body (LGB) and the superior colliculus. The LGB received 80 % of the nerve fibres from the retina, and responds to high contrast achromatic stimulation in the form of drifting gratings of high spatial frequencies. At low spatial frequencies, it is more sensitive to colour. The superior colliculus is insensitive to colour and suppressed by contrast and responds to transitory rapid movements, and receives about 20 % of the optic nerve fibres. A pattern VESP was obtained to black and white checks as a P 23. 5 N 29. 2 P 34 complex in 93 % of normal subjects at an optimal check size of 12 '.

Participants were instructed to attend to one of two simultaneously presented audio tracks from children 2 ̆ 7 s television shows. For all participants the video that matched the target audio track was presented on a screen in front of them. Throughout viewing, white noise probes were played from the same locations as the attended and unattended audio tracks. Each participant sat through two different televised narratives. Narrative comprehensibility was manipulated within-subject such that each participant saw one comprehensible narrative and one incomprehensible narrative. Throughout both, EEG was recorded and subsequently time-locked to the presentation of the auditory probes from the attended and unattended locations. After each narrative, participants were asked to recall aspects of the story that were either central or peripheral to the causal chain of events. The morphology of the participants 2 ̆ 7 auditory evoked potentials followed the expected pattern (a <b>positive-negative-positive</b> complex for adults and a broad positivity for children during the 300 ms after stimulus onset). All participants showed greater processing of the probes from the attended location during the incomprehensible narrative than during the comprehensible narrative, which suggests that participants were processing more information from the attended location when the sequence of events in the narrative was unpredictable. Only children with relatively higher levels of ADHD symptoms showed processing of the probes during the comprehensible narrative. This pattern of results suggests that children with ADHD symptoms were as capable as the typically developing children and adults at the spatially selective attention task, but that they had difficulty engaging in selective attention within the target channel.

The extracellular and intracellular responses to electrical {{stimulation of the}} ventral and dorsal root were studied {{as well as the}} intracellular response to current injection. Field potentials recorded in the lateral motor area following electrical stimulation of lumbar ventral roots had a triphasic <b>positive-negative-positive</b> wave form. The negative component did not return to the base line smoothly but exhibited a 'shoulder' where the negativity increased in duration. Following electrical stimulation of the dorsal root, presynaptic field potentials were recorded upon activation of the afferent axons as well as following synaptic activation of interneurones and motoneurones. The input resistances of neonatal motoneurones determined from the slope of current-voltage plots were high compared with the adult. The resistance decreased with age with a mean of 18. 1 M omega for animals 3 - 5 days old, 8. 8 M omega for animals 6 - 8 days old and 5. 4 M omega for animals 9 - 11 days old. Values for the membrane time constant were similar to those in the adult with a mean of 4. 5 ms. Action potentials elicited by ventral or dorsal root stimulation or by intracellular current injection were marked by a pronounced after-depolarization (a. d. p.) and an after-hyperpolarization (a. h. p.). The amplitude of the a. h. p. varied with that of the a. d. p. The amplitude of excitatory post-synaptic potentials (e. p. s. p. s) elicited by electrical stimulation of the dorsal root was affected by intracellular current injection. Two types of e. p. s. p. s were distinguished: those with a biphasic reversal (early phase first) and those in which the early phase was unaffected by inward current injection while the later phase was reversed. Unlike in the adult, the reversals could be achieved with low current levels and the amplitude of both types of e. p. s. p. was increased by inward current injection. Inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (i. p. s. p. s) were elicited by dorsal or ventral root stimulation. The amplitude of these i. p. s. p. s was diminished and reversed in sign with inward current injection and their amplitude was enhanced with outward current injection.

The evoked potentials were recorded with monopolar and bipolar scalp leads. The records could be averaged directly with ATAC- 401 or MC- 401 medical data processing computer, which had been used for only monopolar recording. The evoked potentials were noted mostly on the ispilateral side of fronto-parietal region at the regular suprathreshold stimulation, but bilateral evoked potentials with the highest amplitude of the ipsilateral fronto-parietal region at the excessive suprathreshold stimulation. EEG of fronto-parietal region was analysed before, {{during and after the}} VL stimulation by means of Walter-type hand-pass filter apparatus. It was interesting that waxing and waning phenomena were observed in the analysed band, which was concordant with the frequency of stimulation. When 6 c/s stimulation was applied, the phenomena were obtained clearly in the θ band, 10 c/s in the α band. The evoked potentials were assumed as an augmenting response when 5 - 10 c/s repetitive stimulation was applied to VL nucleus. The averaged response showed small primary <b>positive-negative-positive</b> phases within 30 msec after stimulation, followed by large late negative phase with 50 to 60 msec of peak latencies. But in some cases, the responses averaged with the computer, showed primary positive phase with 5 to 10 msec and a following large negative phase with 30 to 40 msec of peak latencies, which led into a more variable positive wave with peak latency 50 - 65 msec. The peak latencies of both positive and negative phases showed a fairly constant duration in the stimulations of lower frequencies (1 - 10 c/s). The large negativity with peak latency 30 - 60 msec showed maximum amplitude at 8 - 10 c/s stimulation. When the stimulations of higher frequencies were appiled, the large negativity became lower and lower in amplitude and finally disappeared at the frequency of 15 - 20 c/s. It was considered that the large negativity was the most principal component in the augmenting response of VL stimulation. However, in five cases of parkinsonian patients who showed typical augmenting responses at 5 - 10 c/s stimulation, recruiting-like responses were also noted at 15 - 20 c/s. The position of the tip of the stimulating electrode was checked roentgenologically, and identified to be in the regular VL area of the thalamus.

40|$|The Neoproterozoic {{record of}} {{sedimentary}} carbonates preserves > 20 ‰ of variability in carbon-isotope (δ¹³C) values that dwarfs the ~ 4 ‰ variability recorded in Phanerozoic marine carbonates known to record {{changes in the}} Earth’s carbon cycle through time. When interpreted as primary seawater values, large magnitude δ¹³C swings in Neoproterozoic strata are commonly interpreted to reflect significant changes to the biosphere that are causally related to the oxygenation of the Earth’s atmosphere, global-scale glaciations {{and the evolution of}} complex metazoan life. This thesis considers each of the key isotopic features used to define the δ¹³C record of Neoproterozoic seawater to identify the potential for local sedimentary controls on δ¹³C variation versus global secular change by focussing on the origin of the host carbonate phases from which the δ¹³C values are recorded. The expected bias toward shallow-water intracratonic basins preserved in the Precambrian record predicts that intervals of the record are particularly susceptible to hydrologic restriction and physical isolation from marine connections. The Bitter Springs Formation of the Amadeus Basin in central Australia records a <b>positive-negative-positive</b> stratigraphic δ¹³C trend in its upper Gillen Member. This δ¹³C excursion has been termed the Bitter Springs Anomaly and is routinely used as a global stratigraphic tie point at ~ 800 Ma. A detailed sedimentological study of the Wallara- 1 and BRO 5 drill cores and two field sections in the Amadeus Basin reveal that two distinctly different facies associations occur, a lower unit of cyclic-bedded microbial and grainstone marine limestones and an upper unit of red beds and dolostones interbedded with evaporites and characterised by evidence of subaerial exposure and desiccation. The abrupt decline in recorded δ¹³C values from + 6 ‰ to - 4 ‰ and the following recovery back to + 6 ‰ occurs across the stratigraphic transitions between the evaporative lacustrine and shallow-marine carbonate intervals. Positive δ¹³C values occur exclusively in the evaporative lacustrine facies and were likely modified locally by evaporative processes in a highly restricted sabkha-type basin, indicated by interbedded and nodular anhydrites, halite pseudomorphs and karstic dissolution. Where local facies changes to subaqueous cyclic stromatolitic facies are preserved, δ¹³C values abruptly fall to - 4 ‰ producing the binary isotopic shift that defines the Bitter Springs Anomaly here. The recurrence of this stratigraphic and isotopic association across the basin suggests that changes to local depositional conditions resulting from periodic hydrological restriction and evaporation explain the Bitter Springs Anomaly here rather than global isotopic change in a seawater value that should be decoupled from changes in local sediment composition. The Trezona Formation in the South Australian Flinders Ranges records a - 18 ‰ decline in δ¹³C values stratigraphically below Marinoan-aged (~ 635 Ma) glacial deposits that is used to argue for a link between carbon cycle perturbations reflected in seawater DIC and global glaciation. A high resolution sedimentary study of 9 field sections across the Flinders Ranges shows that the lower Trezona Formation records evidence of deposition at or near base level, indicated by a sequence boundary at its base described by palaeosols and trough cross bedded channelised sandstones, and mud cracks and channelised siliciclastic (fluvial) deposits throughout. The upper Trezona Formation records an uninterrupted sequence of microbial and grainstone carbonates with little evidence of emergence. The vertical recovery from δ¹³C values of - 9 ‰ towards modest values of - 2 ‰ begins across the facies change between lower Trezona Formation interbedded mudstones and limestones and upper Trezona Formation microbial limestones in each section examined, regardless of variations in the stratigraphic thickness of each unit. Indicators of shallow water and exposure coupled with the limited aerial distribution of the Trezona Formation describes a water body that was physically isolated during sea level fall and may have periodically supported phases of non-marine deposition. Here, the dominance of meteoric fluids bearing negative δ¹³C values over seawater exchange allowed for a - 9 ‰ carbonate phase to be precipitated that is likely primary, but is unrepresentative of coeval seawater chemistry. This value then systematically recovered to - 2 ‰ with changing sediment composition as local basinal conditions developed along a deepening trend, inconsistent with the shoaling upward trend toward glacial lowstand proposed by previous studies and obscuring the interpreted causal link between isotope values and the onset of glaciation. The stratigraphic reproducibility of Neoproterozoic δ¹³C profiles of similar age within and between basins provides a principal line of evidence supporting their utility as global chronological tie points and monitors of whole-ocean change. The upper Andree Land Group of NE Greenland records a shift in δ¹³C values from + 6 ‰ to variable negative values of - 4 ‰ to - 10 ‰, before recovering to + 6 ‰ stratigraphically below Sturtian-aged (~ 720 Ma) deposits interpreted as glaciogenic in origin, and is termed the Islay Anomaly. The upper platform to slope transition that precedes the onset of diamictite deposition was studied on Ella Ø in NE Greenland and compared to a lateral section on Kap Weber that was calibrated along two regionally traceable sequence boundaries, providing time-significant surfaces along which spatially disparate δ¹³C profiles can be compared. In both sections, platform carbonates comprising dolomitised stromatolites, pisolitic limestones, and laminated microsparites exclusively record positive δ¹³C values of ~+ 6 ‰ while dolomite-bearing siltstones, mudstones and carbonate debrites associated with slope deposition record negative values of - 4 ‰ to - 10 ‰. On Kap Weber, a return to positive δ¹³C values follows slope-mudstone deposition coincident with a return to platform carbonate deposition that is absent on Ella Ø, which instead records negative δ¹³C values into the base of Sturtian-aged glacial diamictites with no unconformity, confirmed by interbedding and soft sediment deformation across the facies transition. This disparity in terminal δ¹³C values {{at the base of the}} glaciogenic Ulveso Formation suggests that the most negative δ¹³C values recorded in the basin (- 10 ‰) occur broadly synchronous with values of + 6 ‰, but are related to local sediment composition and the dominant process by which carbonate was precipitated on the platform versus the slope. Further, the onset of diamictite deposition occurs asynchronously across the basin, with a correlative conformity at the base of the Ulveso Formation on Ella Ø corresponding to erosion and subaerial exposure on Kap Weber. Elemental mapping of slope mudstones shows that the carbonate phase that records the negative δ¹³C values that define the Islay Anomaly here is a rhombic dolomite phase that is unsorted with surrounding sediment and associated with clays, organic matter and euhedral pyrite, supporting an authigenic origin associated with bacterial sulphate reduction that is not expected to constrain marine water-column δ¹³C variation. The Neoproterozoic δ¹³C record in general preserves a positive ‘background’ value of approximately + 6 ‰ that is punctuated by negative excursions. When interpreted in the same way as Phanerozoic deep-ocean records, sustained δ¹³C values of + 6 ‰ implies signifycantly elevated rates of global carbon burial as photosynthetic biomass, inconsistent with the low oxygen conditions during the Neoproterozoic. While Cenozoic deep-marine pelagic sediments record δ¹³C values as positive as + 2. 5 ‰, a compilation of coeval platform carbonates shows values as positive as + 6 ‰ attributed to photosynthetic effects under hydrologically restricted conditions. Positive δ¹³C values from eight different Neoproterozoic sections from Australia, NW Canada, East Svalbard and NE Greenland, including six intervals that preserve analogous carbonate platform sedimentation as thick packages of microbial and grainstone carbonates, karstic features, desiccation cracks and dolomitisation, are compared with these modern data and are shown to largely plot within the < + 6 ‰ range of δ¹³C variation. As the majority of Neoproterozoic carbonate successions are known to have accumulated above carbonate platforms and ramps, in inland seas, and in other cratonic and transitional-marginal environments, it is proposed that some portion of the positive background δ¹³C value reflects the inherent bias in Neoproterozoic stratigraphy towards these types of depositional conditions.
