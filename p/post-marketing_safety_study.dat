40|$|AbstractTo {{address the}} claim that the Leningrad–Zagreb (L-Z) mumps vaccine strain is causally {{associated}} with aseptic meningitis, a prospective, <b>post-marketing</b> <b>safety</b> <b>study</b> was conducted with a measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) (TRESIVAC°; Serum Institute of India Ltd., Pune, India), which uses the L-Z strain as its mumps component in Egypt. In all, 453 119 children (65 423 children aged 16 – 24 months and 329 211 children aged 5 – 7 years) received MMR. The control groups which, as a result of local health regulations, were slightly younger than vaccinees, comprised 12 253 and 46 232 children, respectively. Using questionnaires, the parents recorded solicited local, systemic and neurological adverse events for up to 42 days post-vaccination. All data were analysed externally on an intention-to-treat basis by individuals not participating in the study. Local and/or systemic reactions were reported in a small percentage of participants, with pain, fever and parotitis being the most common signs among vaccinees in both age groups. No case of aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, anaphylaxis or convulsions was observed in any participant. Thus, in this series of more than 450 000 Egyptian children, the L-Z mumps vaccine strain in this vaccine did not cause aseptic meningitis. The vaccine is considerably cheaper than Western competitors and a valid alternative to other MMR vaccines...|$|E
40|$|Introduction There is no {{consistent}} {{definition of}} prescribers who adopt new drug treatments early. This study examines if COX- 2 inhibitors (coxibs) were prescribed by subsets of practitioners and describes GP adoption patterns of coxibs and existing NSAIDs over time. Methods A population-based drug utilisation study using a Dutch medication claims database. Prescribers of patients (18 +yrs) prescribed an NSAID January 1999 -December 2003 were identified. Four NSAID categories were chosen reflecting selectivity (coxibs, preferential COX- 2 inhibitors and non-selective (ns) NSAIDs (sub-categorised as {{first or second}} line treatment)). The characteristics of prescribers issuing > 10 prescriptions examined were: Type (GP, Specialist, Other); GP NSAID prescribing preference ratio (nsNSAIDs/coxib first prescription); coxib (ratio 67 %); the most frequent prescribing preference was for first-line nsNSAIDs; 50 % percentile prescribing proportions were low (Conclusions Small subsets of prescribers accounted {{for the majority of}} initiations regardless of NSAID type.

40|$|Since {{randomized}} controlled trials (RCT) are typically designed and powered for efficacy rather than safety, power {{is an important}} concern {{in the analysis of}} the effect of treatment on the occurrence of adverse events (AE). These outcomes are often time-to-event outcomes which will naturally be subject to right-censoring due to early patient withdrawals. In the analysis of the treatment effect on such an outcome, gains in efficiency, and thus power, can be achieved by exploiting covariate information. We apply the targeted maximum likelihood methodology to the estimation of treatment specific survival at a fixed end point for right-censored survival outcomes. This approach provides a method for covariate adjustment, that under no or uninformative censoring, does not require any additional parametric modeling assumptions, and, under informative censoring, is consistent under consistent estimation of the censoring mechanism or the conditional hazard for survival. Thus, the targeted maximum likelihood estimator has two important advantages over the Kaplan-Meier estimator: 1) It exploits covariates to improve efficiency, and 2) It is consistent in the presence of informative censoring. These properties are demonstrated through simulation studies. Extensions to the methodology are provided for non randomized <b>post-market</b> <b>safety</b> <b>studies</b> and also for the inclusion of time-dependent covariates...|$|R

40|$|Observational {{epidemiological}} {{studies have been}} used in the medicines context for more than 40 years, contributing to characterize drug use patterns and safety, efficacy and effectiveness profiles. Its use has been increased in recognition of the clinical trials limitations to assess the therapeutic and iatrogenic potential of the medicines after its commercialization. The evolution of the regulatory framework for pharmacovigilance, requiring <b>post-marketing</b> <b>studies,</b> post-authorization <b>safety</b> <b>studies</b> (PASS) and the post-authorization efficacy studies (PAES) to approve certain drugs, reinforced the importance of observational pharmacoepidemiology for the characterization of the medicines safety and effectiveness profiles. Pharmacoepidemiological research can be carried out from field studies designed to obtain the necessary information or in databases with health records of population samples that already contain the information. This 2 nd option is more efficient and more and more frequent. Although, observational research from field studies continues to have its space, the increasing availability of databases allowed a new development to observational pharmacoepidemiology. Indeed, access to automated records databases with up-to-date information on medical prescriptions and global health care to representative population samples with long follow-up periods is a valuable tool for the study of drug use patterns and therapeutic and iatrogenic potential in routine clinical practice. In this context, observational pharmacoepidemiology reinforces its role as a scientific area particularly suitable for evaluating the safety and the effectiveness of the medicines in the “real world”, making a relevant contribution to overcome the gap in translating the evidence from the clinical trials for clinical practice...|$|R

K., Tokyo, Japan Background: A post-marketing {{surveillance}} (PMS) {{study was}} conducted with a 1 -year observation period to assess the safety and efficacy of lamotrigine in routine clinical practice in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). Patients and methods: Central enrollment method was used to recruit patients diagnosed with BD who were being treated {{for the first time with}} lamotrigine to prevent the recurrence/relapse of BD mood episodes. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and recurrence/relapse were assessed. Improvement of mania and depression was also assessed using the Hamilton’s Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) at treatment initiation, 4 – 6  months post treatment initiation, and 10 – 12  months post treatment initiation. Results: A total of 237 / 989 patients (24. 0 %) reported ADRs, most commonly rash (9. 1 %), and the incidence of serious ADRs was 3. 3 % (33 / 989 patients). Skin disorders occurred in 130 patients (13. 1 %), mostly within 8  weeks post treatment. A total of 237 / 703 patients (33. 7 %) experienced recurrence/relapse of mood episodes. The 25 th percentile of the time to recurrence/relapse of mood episodes was 105  days. Remission of depression symptoms (HAM-D ≤ 7) occurred in 147 / 697 patients (21. 1 %) at treatment initiation, rising to 361 patients (67. 4 %) at 10 – 12  months post treatment. Remission of manic symptoms (YMRS ≤ 13) occurred in 615 / 676 patients (91. 0 %) at treatment initiation, rising to 500 patients (97. 3 %) at 10 – 12  months post treatment.

40|$|Abstract: Observational {{healthcare}} data, such as electronic health {{records and}} administrative claims databases, provide longitudinal clinical {{information at the}} individual level. These data cover {{tens of millions of}} patients and present unprecedented opportunities to address such issues as <b>post-market</b> <b>safety</b> of medical products. Analyzing patient-level databases yields population-level inferences, or ‘results’, such as the strength of association between medical product exposure and subsequent outcomes, often with thousands of drugs and outcomes. In this article, by contrast, we study ‘big results’, which are the product of applying thousands of alternative analysis strategies to five large patient databases. These results were produced by the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership. All together, there are more than 6 million results, comprising risk assessments for 399 medical product–outcome pairs analyzed across five observational databases using seven statistical methods, each of which has between a few dozen and a few hundred variants representing parameters or ‘tuning variables’. We focus on the value of knowledge discovery methods and the challenges in extracting clinically relevant knowledge from big results. We believe our analyses are both scientifically and methodologically valuable as they reveal information about how methods/algorithms perform under various circumstances, as well as provide a basis for comparison of these methods. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

Many key aspects of the Act depend upon the precise nature of supporting regulations that are still to be implemented. Despite the new powers conferred by the legislation on the Minister of Health, there is some concern that these discretionary powers may not be exercised, and that Health Canada may not have sufficient resources to take advantage of these new powers.

If postmarketing vigilance observes an increased incidence or severi-ty of known adverse drug reactions (ADRs) or occurrences of unexpected serious ADRs, then safety-related regu-latory actions (SRRAs) are taken by the regulators, which might include intensi-fication of patient monitoring and re-striction of patient population.
