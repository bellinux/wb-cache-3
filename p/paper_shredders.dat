25|$|Since CD-Rs {{in general}} cannot be logically erased to any degree, the {{disposal}} of CD-Rs presents a possible security issue if they contain sensitive / private data. Destroying the data requires physically destroying the disc or data layer. Heating the disc in a microwave oven for 10–15 seconds effectively destroys the data layer by causing arcing in the metal reflective layer, but this same arcing may cause damage or excessive wear to the microwave oven.

40|$|By late January 2002, the FBI had {{strategically}} secured what documents {{remained at}} Enronʼs Houston headquarters following evidence that employees were destroying documents that implicated them in wrong-doing {{in what was}} one of the greatest accounting scandals in United States history. Company staff fed reams of <b>papers</b> through <b>shredders,</b> one employee even taking home some of the scrapped documents to use as packing material (CNN, 2002). With the Enron scandal a prominent fixture in the news throughout late 2001 and into 2002, certainly those shredding the documents were responsible for their actions and should be held accountable. After all, they knew what they were doing, they chose to do it, and the actions they performed required both thought and a conscious decision to not engage in alternative actions. In acting with self-awareness, personal choice, consciousness, and a sense of purpose, the employees demonstrated the hallmarks of what is commonly regarded as free will. The Free Will Debate: Psychological Science versus Psychological Reality As compelling as this conclusion is, it doesn't sit well with scientific psychology. Of course, if free will is defined as choice, higher-level thought, or goal-directed behavior, then there is no problem. Free will simply becomes an umbrella term for these well-documented features of human experience. But free will has other connotations that fly in the face of scientific assumptions about the sources of human thought and action (e. g., (Bargh & Chartrand, 1999; Skinner, 1971). The most troublesome connotation is that freel...|$|R
30|$|The Shredder Challenge {{provided}} 5 puzzles {{of increasing}} complexity. The puzzles {{were the result}} of processing <b>papers</b> through document <b>shredders.</b> As a result, the pieces were tiny but had a regular size. All of these documents were handwritten text of increasing density and quantity, except for Puzzle 2 which was an image. It must be noted that the contestant were not required to solve all the puzzle to win the prize but had to answer specific questions. In order to do so, the answers had to found in part or totality of a document. Some artificial features like coffee mug marks, capital letters, different writing colors were introduced in the document to make solving the puzzles and answering the specific questions easier. As a consequence, the connection between puzzle time, solving time and effort is loose. Figure  2 is a screenshot of the virtual board provided by the UCSD team to the public. The figure also depicts the solution of Puzzle 2.|$|R
500|$|In 1955, {{after five}} years of reconstruction, the Rotes Rathaus was fully {{operational}} and departments were able to move back into it from both administration buildings and from other more remote locations. Early in the same year, it was announced that Altes Stadthaus was to be transferred from the Magistrat (now of East Berlin, West Berlin having established the separate Berlin Senate) to the Council of Ministers of the GDR, which had been established in 1949, to house the significantly increased workforce. Altes Stadthaus was planned to be only an interim solution to this problem. Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl moved his offices into the building later that year, after renovation work to create appropriate accommodations that included furnishings for various official rooms, the planned expansion onto the fourth floor, upgrading of the stairways, ventilation equipment, and electrical work had been completed. Red carpets were laid in hallways and stair landings, and eventually <b>paper</b> <b>shredders</b> were placed in all offices. Between 1958–61, the building was extensively altered. The inner courtyard was covered [...] and the [...] "Bear Hall" [...] was converted into the chamber of the Council of Ministers. The hall capacity was reduced from 1,500 to 300 people, the windows and arcades on the long sides were closed off, wood wall moldings and a suspended ceiling installed to create a modern room within the space. The candelabra, bronze door grilles, and marble flooring were removed. In 1959, the bear statue was also removed and installed in the newly opened East Berlin zoo in Friedrichsfelde. A security zone was created {{at the front of the}} building. The public entrance to what was now the [...] "Building of the Council of Ministers" [...] was now on Klosterstraße. The main entrance facing Jüdenstraße, over which the GDR national emblem, the hammer and compass, was installed in place of the arms of the City of Berlin, was only opened on special occasions. The alterations demonstrated the negative opinion in the GDR of Wilhelmine architecture, and cost 2million marks.|$|E

5000|$|The Union Bank of Switzerland used <b>paper</b> <b>shredders</b> {{to destroy}} {{evidence}} that their company owned property stolen from Jews during the Holocaust by the Nazi government. The shredding was disclosed {{to the public}} through the work of Christoph Meili, a security guard working at the bank who happened to wander by a room where the shredding was taking place. Also in the shredding room were books from the German Reichsbank. They listed stock accounts for companies involved in the holocaust, including BASF, Degussa, and Degesch. They also listed real-estate records for Berlin properties that had been forcibly taken by the Nazis, placed in Swiss accounts, and then claimed to be owned by UBS.

5000|$|Consumer {{electronics}} or home electronics are electronic or {{digital equipment}} intended for everyday use, typically in private homes. Consumer electronics include devices used for entertainment (flatscreen TVs, DVD players, DVD movies, iPods, video games, remote control cars, etc.), communications (telephones, cell phones, e-mail-capable laptops, etc.), and home-office activities (e.g., desktop computers, printers, <b>paper</b> <b>shredders,</b> etc.). In British English, {{they are often}} called brown goods by producers and sellers, to distinguish them from [...] "white goods" [...] such as washing machines and refrigerators. In the 2010s, this distinction is not always present in large big box consumer electronics stores, such as Best Buy, which sell both entertainment, communications, and home office devices and kitchen appliances such as refrigerators. Consumer electronics stores differ from professional audio stores in that the former sells consumer-grade electronics for private use, whereas the latter sells professional-grade electronics designed for use by audio engineers and audio technicians.|$|E
50|$|During the regime's final days, Stasi {{officials}} destroyed documents with <b>paper</b> <b>shredders</b> and by burning.

They knew that the Stasi office in Erfurt was heated with gas, which only makes white smoke. They deduced that dark smoke {{was the result of}} burning papers. With the help of other citizens they occupied the local secret police buildings. They also called the military prosecutor. The prosecutor sealed the buildings and formed a citizen's committee (Bürgerkomittee) for inspection of the remaining files and surveillance of the work of the state-security officials.This became a blueprint for what happened over the next days in Stasi buildings all over East Germany. Citizens gained access to the Stasi headquarters in Berlin on January 15, 1990 to halt the destruction there.|$|E

For each police general who is shredding documents of his past there are officers under him who are Photostatting them to keep as insurance against future prosecutions. [...] A normal machine, however, did not seem especially creative, so, after abandoning representative bread-slicers (in view of the palling thought of wasted dough), animated projections (in view of Kentridge's reluctance to spend hours drawing them) and the dog's mouth (in view of its narrowness), they settled on a crocodile's mouth, to be carried as a handbag by Ubu's wife.

40|$|Abstract. Consider two ordinary, {{seemingly}} identical plain <b>paper</b> <b>shredders</b> labeled A and B. When {{each of the}} two shredders is fed a {{blank sheet}} of paper, the resulting remnants are sufficiently similar that they are indistinguishable upon visual inspection. Now suppose that one of the shredders has been modified to introduce imperceptible variations in the size of each remnant it cuts. One of the shredders is then selected at random to destroy a blank sheet. By examination of the resulting paper remnants, can one determine if the sheet was shredded by A or B? In this paper we show how information hidden in {{the size and shape of}} shredded page remnants can be used to reveal the identity of the device used for shredding. We describe means for modifying shredders to introduce this hidden information. Experimental results reveal that properly embedded information can survive the severe nonlinear distortions introduced by the mechanics of paper shredding. Finally, we consider the question of whether paper shreds could reveal shredder identity even in the absence of device modifications...|$|E
