40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 36 - 39) This {{study investigated}} the documentation of <b>proof</b> <b>rolling</b> requirements for the 50 United States. A search of the Department of Transportation website for each state was conducted and data compiled. A field observation was conducted using a 31, 000 lb water truck to roll over Class 4 Decomposed Granite that was compacted to 95 % according to sand cone and nuclear densometer testing. Analysis was also conducted to document the percent increase in area and volume of coverage when <b>proof</b> <b>rolling</b> is used in addition to sand cone or nuclear testing. Literature relating to <b>proof</b> <b>rolling,</b> earthwork, and compaction was reviewed {{to contribute to the}} results of this study. It was concluded from the observed analysis that <b>proof</b> <b>rolling</b> using pneumatic tired vehicles is a sufficient check for compaction. It was also concluded that the lack of literature and standard procedures for <b>proof</b> <b>rolling</b> has created requirements specifying various equipment, loads, and methods to be followed to satisfy compaction requirements...|$|E
40|$|<b>Proof</b> <b>rolling</b> of {{aircraft}} pavements is an Australian practice {{that is designed}} to reveal pavement layer deficiencies prior to the construction of the next pavement layer. There are a number of heavy pneumatic-tyred proof rollers available in Australia for this purpose. These rollers are predominantly owned by the Department of Defence and made available to airfield constructors, on a project-by-project basis. The selection of rollers and the design of <b>proof</b> <b>rolling</b> regimes should utilise the stress with depth calculation function of layered elastic design tools such as APSDS. <b>Proof</b> <b>rolling</b> regimes can be determined by comparison {{of aircraft}} and roller induced plots of the damage indicator with depth. The traditional use of Boussinesq’s equation for simple load stress with depth in a single elastic layer is also viable for many practical applications. Strain and deflection could also be used as the damage indicator but stress is the most effective as the pavement structure, subgrade strength and location of the damage indicator have little effect on the calculated stresses. A single layer representation of the pavement is also adequate. More specific cases, where the absolute values of the damage indicator are required or where non-typical pavements are to be designed, a customised pavement structure may be justifiable for the roller and aircraft induced stress calculations...|$|E

40|$|<b>Proof</b> <b>rolling</b> of {{granular}} layers in aircraft pavements is {{an integral}} part of the pavement thickness design methods used in Australia. The Department of Defence has a fleet of special purpose pneumatic tyred rollers with the capability to operate at up to 50 t on four wheels with tyre pressures of 1, 400 kPa. In 2004 the tyre manufacturers reduced the maximum allowable tyre pressures to 1, 000 kPa, creating a gap between aircraft load and the capacity of the proof rollers. To allow flexible aircraft pavements to continue to be constructed, one roller was upgraded to include solid urethane tyres with an effective contract pressure of 1, 700 kPa and higher. Whilst this roller has undergone a preliminary trial that was found to be successful, further trials are required prior to upgrading the remaining roller fleet...|$|E
40|$|APSDS is a layered elastic {{tool for}} {{aircraft}} pavement thickness determination developed and distributed by Mincad Systems {{and based on}} the sister software Circly. As aircraft pavement thickness determination remains an empirical science, mechanistic-empirical design tools such as APSDS require calibration to full scale pavement performance, via the S 77 - 1 curve. APSDS provides the unique advantage over other tools that it models all the aircraft in all their wandering positions, negating the need for designers to use pass to cover ratios and acknowledging that different aircraft have their wheels located at difference distances from the aircraft centerline. APSDS requires a range of input parameters to be entered, including subgrade modulus, aircraft types, masses and passes and a pavement structure. A pavement thickness is then returned which has 50 % design reliability. Greater levels of reliability are obtained by conservative selection of input values. Whilst most input parameters have a linear influence on pavement thickness, subgrade modulus changes have a greater influence at lower values and less influence at higher values. When selecting input values, designers should concentrate their efforts on subgrade modulus and aircraft mass as these have the greatest influence on the required pavement thickness. Presumptive or standard values are generally acceptable for the less influential parameters. S 77 - 1 pavement thicknesses are of a standard composition with only the subbase thickness varying. Non-standard pavement structures are determined using the principle of material equivalence and the FAA provides range of material equivalence factors, of which the mid-range values are most commonly used. APSDS allows direct modelling of non-standard pavement structures. By comparing different APSDS pavements of equal structural capacity, implied material equivalences can be calculated. These APSDS implied material equivalences lie {{at the lower end of}} the ranges published by FAA. In order to obtain consistence between APSDS and the FAA guidance, the following material equivalence values are recommended: * Asphalt for Crushed Rock. 1. 3. * Crushed Rock for Uncrushed Gravel. 1. 2. * Asphalt for Uncrushed Gravel. 1. 6. <b>Proof</b> <b>rolling</b> regimes remain an important part of the design and construction of flexible aircraft pavements. Historically, designers relied on Bousinesq's equation and the assumption of point loads on semi-finite homogenous materials to determine <b>proof</b> <b>rolling</b> regimes using stress as the indicator of damage. The ability of APSDS to generate stress, strain and deflection at any depth and any location across the pavement allows these historical assumptions to be tested. As the design of a <b>proof</b> <b>rolling</b> regime is one of comparing damage indicators modelled under aircraft loads to those under heavy roller loads, the historical simplifications are generally valid for practical design scenarios. Where project specific data is required, APSDS can readily calculate stresses induced by proof rollers and aircraft at any location and depth for comparison. APSDS is a leading tool for flexible aircraft pavement thickness determination due to its flexibility, transparency and being free from bias. However, the following possible areas for improvement are considered worthy of future research and development: * Improvements to the user interface. * Ability to model aircraft masses as frequency distributions. * Ability to copy stress with depth data to Excel(tm) spreadsheets. * Ability to perform parametric runs. * Inclusion of a reliability based design module...|$|E
