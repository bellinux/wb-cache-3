5|$|Fearing {{he could}} not {{guarantee}} {{the integrity of the}} <b>polling</b> <b>places,</b> Clayton canceled fall elections in counties where political violence had broken out. In doing so, however, he further reduced the Democratic vote, and the state ended up supporting the election of President Grant, the Republican candidate, despite the population being mostly Democratic.|$|E
5|$|During {{the ensuing}} years, Parliament adopted several more minor reforms. Acts of Parliament passed in 1835 and 1836 {{increased}} the number of <b>polling</b> <b>places</b> in each constituency, and reduced polling to a single day. Parliament also passed several laws aimed at combatting corruption, including the Corrupt Practices Act 1854, though these measures proved largely ineffectual. Neither party strove for further major reform; leading statesmen on both sides regarded the Reform Act as a final settlement.|$|E

5|$|In the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, Hamersley {{is split}} between the electorates of Girrawheen and Balcatta, ordinarily both safe seats for the Australian Labor Party. At polling place level, Hamersley {{supported}} the Liberal Party at every election since its first in 1971 until the 1996 election. In both the 2001 and 2005 elections, <b>polling</b> <b>places</b> in Hamersley, as with those in many northern Perth suburbs, switched to the Australian Labor Party at state level. However, at the 2008 and 2013 elections, the suburb returned a majority for the Liberals.|$|E
5|$|The First Ward Wardroom is a {{historic}} meeting hall at 171 Fountain Street in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. It is a single-story red brick building, with a low-pitch gable-over-hipped roof. Basically rectangular, an enclosed entry pavilion projects from the main block. The building, designed by William R. Walker & Son and built in 1886, {{is one of only}} three ward halls (structures built by the city and used as <b>polling</b> <b>places</b> and meeting halls) to survive in the state. Since about 1920 it has been the Major Walter G. Gatchell Post No. 306 of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
25|$|A 2017 {{study found}} that the opening and closing hours of <b>polling</b> <b>places</b> determines the age {{demographics}} of turnout: turnout among younger voters is higher the longer <b>polling</b> <b>places</b> are open and turnout among older voters decreases the later <b>polling</b> <b>places</b> open.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{had been used}} by Elections Canada for a <b>polling</b> <b>place.</b> In 2008, some voters were mistakenly told to vote at the church, instead of at the new <b>polling</b> <b>place</b> at Marshall McLuhan Catholic Secondary School.|$|R
25|$|Under the law then in force, each <b>polling</b> <b>place</b> was {{manned by}} {{randomly}} selected citizens from the corresponding district, who formed the Mesa Directiva (Directing Committee).

In addition to the <b>polling</b> <b>place</b> officers, each party, coalition, or alliance participating in the election could name up to two observers and one alternate for each <b>polling</b> <b>place</b> (article 198 of the COFIPE).|$|R
50|$|For 2015, the {{community}} voted {{to make the}} school the sole <b>polling</b> <b>place</b> in Killingly. The Secretary of State informed the town registrar's office {{that this was a}} misinterpretation of statute, and in 2016 a second <b>polling</b> <b>place</b> was opened.|$|R

25|$|Pliego Carrasco {{compared}} {{the size and}} type of the errors in the different <b>polling</b> <b>places,</b> sorted according to who won the polling place. For example, for <b>polling</b> <b>places</b> in which the number of ballots issued to the polling place {{is different from the}} number of votes tallied plus the number of leftover ballots, he gives the table below. The FCH column gives the number of <b>polling</b> <b>places</b> where Calderón received the most votes that exhibited that type of error, while the AMLO column shows the number where López Obrador received the most votes. Undervotes refers to the case where the number of votes tallied plus the number of leftover ballots is less than the number of blank ballots allocated to the polling place, while Overvotes is the case where the number of allocated blank ballots is less than the votes tallied plus leftover ballots. The numbers are also taken from the PREP.|$|E

50|$|The first {{elections}} were conducted {{under the laws}} of the former colonies. The 1903 election however was conducted under the Commonwealth Electoral Act, and the related Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902 which gave Australian women the right to vote at a national level, and to stand for election to the Parliament. The process was that each elector was allocated to a particular <b>polling</b> <b>place</b> in the division and in the ordinary course would vote at that <b>polling</b> <b>place</b> by placing a cross opposite the name of the candidate they wished to vote for and their name would be marked off the roll. If the elector attended another <b>polling</b> <b>place,</b> they had to make a declaration and the vote was sent to the designated <b>polling</b> <b>place</b> for that elector. The system was thereby designed as a check to prevent a person from voting more than once in the election. An elector could in limited circumstances apply for a postal vote. What happened in these cases was that electors attending another <b>polling</b> <b>place</b> were not given ordinary ballot papers, but instead were given a blank ballot paper to write down the name of the candidate they wished to vote for.|$|R
25|$|The Chief Election Commissioner of India (CEC), N. Gopalaswami, had stated on 28 December 2008, {{that the}} {{elections}} {{were likely to}} be held between April and May 2009.
