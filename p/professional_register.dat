5000|$|For example, in United Kingdom {{tail docking}} was {{originally}} undertaken largely by dog breeders. However, in 1991, the UK government amended the Veterinary Surgeons Act (1966), prohibiting the docking of dogs' tails by lay persons from 1 July 1993. Only veterinary surgeons were, by law, allowed to dock. However, following {{the passage of}} the law, the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons in November 1992, ruled docking to be unethical, [...] "unless for therapeutic or acceptable prophylactic reasons". The requirement in which the Royal College considers prophylactic docking to be acceptable are so strict as to make the routine docking of puppies by veterinary surgeons extremely difficult. Vets who continue to dock risk disciplinary action, and can be removed from the <b>professional</b> <b>register.</b> Those found guilty of unlawful docking would face a fine of up to £20,000, up to 51 weeks imprisonment or both. They can only dock the tail of [...] "working" [...] dogs (in some specific cases) - e.g. hunting dogs that work in areas thick in brambles and heavy vegetation where the dog's tail can get caught and cause injury to the dog. Docking was banned in England and Wales by the Animal Welfare Act 2006 and in Scotland by the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006.|$|E
50|$|Generally, {{the notice}} period in Bulgaria is 30 days, {{provided}} no agreement {{for a longer}} notice period has been reached (for a maximum of 3 months). Art. 329 of the Labour Code allows the employer to exercise the so-called suffrage (social choice) in cases of termination for partial enterprise dissolution operation, staff reduction or decrease in the volume of work. The employer may release those workers whose jobs {{are not subject to}} reduction, and retain instead employees with higher job performance level or qualifications if he deems that to be {{in the best interest of}} the enterprise. The proper conduct of these elections is a condition for the legality of the termination of the employment contract. Employers in Bulgaria can terminate the employment relationship in accordance with Art.330 para. 1 and para. 2 of the LC extraordinarily and without notice. This right arises, inter alia: during the arrest of the employee for the purpose of enforcement of a criminal conviction; when the employee is denied the right to exercise certain profession by a court or other state bodies; in withdrawing the academic degree of the employee which has been decisive for the conclusion of the employment contract; in withdrawal of the worker from the appropriate <b>professional</b> <b>register</b> (e.g. pharmacists, doctors, etc.); if the employee is released on disciplinary grounds. In Bulgaria, the employer may offer the employee to terminate the employment contract for payment of severance payment. If the employee does not accept in writing this offer within a period of 7 days, this is considered a rejection of the offer. If the worker accepts the offer, the employer is obliged to pay a compensation in the amount no less than four times his last gross monthly salary.|$|E

40|$|Reflection and {{reflective}} practice {{has become a}} key issue for curriculum development within nurse education, particularly mental health nursing. The Nursing and Midwifery Council has linked the demonstration of reflective skills to clinical competence to gain entrance onto the <b>professional</b> <b>register.</b> However, despite a significant volume of literature on reflection there is a paucity of research evidence regarding how nurse educators teach mental health nursing students to reflect and become effective reflective practitioners and, little research exploring experiences of staff and students engaged in reflection for teaching and learning purposes. A person-centred enquiry was undertaken to explore staff and student perceptions and understanding of reflection {{in the context of}} the undergraduate pre- and post-registration mental health nursing diploma programme, utilising a framework involving four focus groups and conducted in a university setting. The findings from the discussions that took place within the focus group setting produced a new model and an extended description of reflection together with non-prescriptive recommendations aimed at enhancing teaching practice. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|This {{handbook}} {{provides guidance}} on clinical supervision for nurse supervisors of postgraduate learners. It is {{designed as a}} resource for supervisors that can be applied and adapted for all post-graduate nursing programmes within the College. Post-graduate programmes in this context are designed to prepare nurses to meet the requirements for the role of clinical nurse specialist and advanced nurse practitioner. The handbook covers a range of key topics relevant to clinical supervision that include; defining clinical supervision, benefits of supervision, effective supervision, assessment educational needs, providing feedback and managing learners in difficulty. Many of the features of clinical supervision for post-graduate learners in nursing are directly transferrable and applicable to clinical supervision to use in everyday practice. Crucially, as nurses undertaking post-graduate programmes are already on the <b>professional</b> <b>register,</b> they are subject to An Bord Altranais ‘Code of Conduct’ (ABA, 2000) and Scope of Professional Practice (ABA, 2000). It should also be remembered that post-graduate learners often part-time students and often in full-time employment. Over the past decade there has been growing interest in clinical supervision within nursing in Ireland. While it still remains at a developmental stage there is increasing evidence that it is being integrated into continuous professional development. The NCNM (2008) provide a range for case studies of the introduction of clinical supervision for nursing in a range of practice settings (including mental health, palliative care, public health nursing) and role (Registered Nurses, Clinical Nurse specialist and clinical nurse managers) ...|$|E
