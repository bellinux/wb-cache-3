40|$|A semisolid urea-motility-indole medium {{designed}} for detection in Enterobacteriaceae of urease activity, motility, and indole production in one tube was prepared and evaluated.

Detection of ARS Activity ARS activity of the rARS modification constructs we made was measured using a plasmid stability assay based on that described previously (Shirahige et al., 1993). In short, modified rARS fragments (458971 - 459565 from wild type; 459010 - 459565 from rARSΔ- 3; and the ARS 1 fragment plus the native rDNA sequence until 459565 from ARS 1 -R; SGD chr XII numbering) were amplified using PCR.

40|$|Abstract — In our project, we {{consider}} the problem of replicating human two-fingered grasping motions on the AX 12 Smart Robotic Arm. Two-fingered grasping motions {{are among the most}} common motions used in everyday life. Examples include <b>picking</b> up a <b>plate</b> from a dishwasher, moving a chess piece, and as we will demonstrate, opening a drawer. In fact, many more complicated motions, such as holding a pen/pencil and writing involve a two-fingered grasping component. To accomplish this goal, we designed a sensor mount positioned behind the robotic arm that accommodates a variety of sensors including a 720 p highdefinition webcam. Then, using SIFT features, we locate (in the webcam image) the feature associated with the drawer that we want to open and close defined by a point in the image. Using previous calibration and bilinear interpolation, we convert this coordinate into global Cartesian space. This coordinate is subsequently fed into the analytical inverse kinematics service which replies with the joint coordinates. Subsequently, these are given to the controller which moves the arm to a desired location. Then, using a series of movements, we can perform our task. In particular, this project takes advantage of ROS’s service/client and publisher/subscriber model. These paradigms form the basis for communication between different components of the project.

Clones are <b>picked</b> into microtiter <b>plate</b> wells and stored at - 70 degrees C. A semiautomatic robot system allows the generation of filter replicas containing up to 10, 000 clones per membrane. Sets of membranes containing 15 - 20 chromosome equivalents of both chromosomes will be used for the construction of ordered clone libraries by hybridization fingerprinting protocols. In addition, multiple sets of two membranes containing 4 chromosome equivalents of the human X chromosome, and one membrane containing 3 chromosome equivalents of chromosome 21, have been distributed to other interested laboratories as part of a system of reference libraries. This system allows other groups easy access to the clones and offers an efficient protocol to combine results generated in different laboratories using these libraries.

During his time there, Cyprian meets the colonel's two daughters: the elder, Augusta, is a lovely woman and the picture of perfect health, while the younger, Adelgunda, is lovely but {{physically}} gaunt and naturally quiet. Cyprian notices that other members of the household try to attract attention away from Adelgunda as much as possible. The family especially tries to keep her hidden at nine at night, attributing it to her frailty. On the night of her birthday, Adelgunda hosts many of her friends, and offers to show them her impression of what she calls the White Lady. However, when the clock strikes nine, she is paralyzed, begins to cry out about a terrifying female figure that no one else can see, and faints. Every night on, Adelgunda claims to see this same figure, although no one else is able to see or feel it. Many doctors are called in, one who decides to trick Adelgunda's perception of time in order to investigate the link between her vision and the clock. The family sets the clock forward an hour without telling her, but that night she still goes into the same state she does every night at nine, even though the clock only strikes eight. To prove that the spirit is real, Adelgunda <b>picks</b> ups a <b>plate</b> and lets it go, and the plate floats motionless in the air. Shocked, the mother dies in the ensuing days, Augusta becomes a shell of her former self, and the colonel dies in battle.|$|R
40|$|The {{composition}} of the dominating population of freshly cut beef, and beef stored at 4 degrees C for 8 d, was studied by direct analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene (PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing) and compared with pure culture technique where the isolates picked from the viable plate count were identified by sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene. The {{composition of}} the bacterial population was recorded at two different time points, at the start when the viable plate count of the meat was 4 x 102 colony forming unit (cfu) per cm(2) {{and when it was}} 5 x 107 cfu per cm(2). Direct gene analysis by PCR amplification generated 30 clones, and 79 isolates were <b>picked</b> from the <b>plate</b> count, and identified by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. At the low initial bacterial load of the beef, the two sampling strategies showed variations in the composition of species. Direct 16 S rRNA gene analysis revealed a domination of Bacillus-like sequences while no such sequences were found in isolates from the viable plate count. Instead the population of the plate count was dominated by Chryseobacterium spp. In contrast, the two sampling strategies matched on the multiplying beef population, where both methods indicated Pseudomonas spp. as the dominating group (99 % of the population-sequences), irrespectively of sampling strategy. Pseudomonas panacis/Pseudomons brennerii was the dominating taxon (99 % similarity to type strain), but sequences with highest similarity to Pseudomonas lundensis (99 %), Pseudomonas beteli (99 %) and Pseudomonas koreensis (100 %) were also found.
