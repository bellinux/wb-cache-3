40|$|Purpose {{of review}} <b>Pancreas</b> <b>transplantation</b> {{reproducibly}} induces <b>insulin</b> independence in beta-cell penic diabetic patients. The difference between full insulin independence, partial graft function, and graft loss, mostly results from technical failure, graft rejection, and patient death with function graft. The {{purpose of this}} review is to examine recent Surgical advances and discuss their contribution to improved graft function. Recent findings Few actual surgical innovations were described in the period reviewed. Duodenoduodenostomy is an interesting option for drainage of digestive secretions, when the pancreas is placed behind the right colon and is oriented cephalad. The main advantage of this technique is easy endoscopic assessment of donor duodenum but, when allograft pancreatectomy is necessary, repair of native duodenum may be troublesome. Selective revascularization of the gastroduodenal artery, at the back-table, possibly improves blood supply {{to the head of}} the pancreas graft and duodenal segment. There is no proof that this additional maneuver is always beneficial, although it can be graft saving in case of poor segmental graft perfusion. Summary Transplant surgeons should be familiar with all techniques for <b>pancreas</b> <b>transplantation.</b> Long-term graft function is possible only after technically successful <b>pancreas</b> <b>transplantation.</b> There is clearly a need for more objective assessment and standardization of surgical techniques for <b>pancreas</b> <b>transplantation...</b>|$|R

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{is generally}} treated with oral diabetic drugs and/or insulin. However, the {{morbidity and mortality}} associated with this condition increases over time, even in patients receiving intensive insulin treatment, and this is largely attributable to diabetic complications or the <b>insulin</b> therapy itself. <b>Pancreas</b> <b>transplantation</b> in humans was first conducted in 1966, since when {{there has been much}} debate regarding the legitimacy of this procedure. Technical refinements and the development of better immunosuppressants and better postoperative care have brought about marked improvements in patient and graft survival and a reduction in postoperative morbidity. Consequently, <b>pancreas</b> <b>transplantation</b> has become the curative treatment modality for diabetes, particularly for type I diabetes.

40|$|Abstract. The {{first attempt}} to cure type 1 {{diabetes}} by <b>pancreas</b> <b>transplantation</b> was done at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis, on December 17, 1966, followed {{by a series of}} whole <b>pancreas</b> <b>transplantation.</b> Due to the lack of potent immunosuppressive drugs, rejections and infections, it was concluded that pancreas was less antigenic than the kidney which was less antigenic than the duodenum. It opened the door to a period, between the mid 70 âs to mid 80 âs where only segmental pancreatic grafts were used in the recipient. Numerous techniques for diverting or dealing with the pancreas juice secretion were described, none of them being satisfactory. In the late 70 âs â early 80 âs, three major events happened and boosted the development of <b>pancreas</b> <b>transplantation</b> : firstly the introduction of Cyclosporine A in the clinical field, secondly the organization on March 1980, of the first international meeting on <b>Pancreas</b> <b>Transplantation</b> with the first report of the International <b>Pancreas</b> <b>Transplantation</b> Registry (IPTR) and finally in 1982, the organization of the first informal so-called Spitzingsee meetings where <b>pancreas</b> <b>transplantation</b> successes but mainly failures were discussed which precluded the onset of IPITA (International <b>Pancreas</b> and Islet <b>Transplantation</b> Association), EuroSPK (European Study Group for simultaneous <b>Pancreas</b> and Kidney <b>Transplantation)</b> and EPITA (European <b>Pancreas</b> and Islet <b>Transplantation</b> Association). During one of the Spitzingsee meetings, participants had the idea to renew the urinary drainage technique of the exocrine secretion of the pancreatic graft with segmental graft and eventually with whole pancreaticoduodenal transplant. That was clinically achieved during the mid 80 âs and remained the mainstay technique during the next decade. In parallel, the Swedish group developed the whole <b>pancreas</b> <b>transplantation</b> technique with enteric diversion. It was the onset of the whole pancreas reign. The enthusiasm for the technique was rather moderated in its early phase due to the rapid development of liver transplantation and the need for sharing vascular structures between both organs, liver and pancreas. During the modern era of immunosuppression, the whole <b>pancreas</b> <b>transplantation</b> technique with enteric diversion became the gold standard for simultaneous <b>pancreas</b> and kidney <b>transplantation</b> (SPK), with portal drainage of the venous effluent of the pancreas, even for pancreas after kidney (PAK) or <b>pancreas</b> <b>transplantation</b> alone (PTA). Today, there remains room for improvement : safety of using the duodeno-duodenal anastomosis technique must be confirmed by prospective analysis while preventing ischemic reperfusion injuries, using specific drugs; that must be assessed in new trials.

Methods: In this retrospective observational study, diabetic patients who underwent <b>pancreas</b> <b>transplantation</b> in a single medical center and developed symptomatic acute macular edema and peripapillary soft exudate within 3 months after the operation were enrolled. The complete ophthalmic course and medical records of the patients were retrospectively reviewed. Diabetic retinopathy and progression following treatment after <b>pancreas</b> <b>transplantation</b> were measured. Results: Six Chinese women with type 1 DM were enrolled in this study. Mean hemoglobin (Hb) A 1 c was 13. 4 % prior to transplantation and decreased rapidly to 6. 5 % within 2 months postsurgery. The patients had no or mild pretransplant diabetic retinopathy and developed acute symptomatic macular edema and peripapillary soft exudate in both eyes after <b>pancreas</b> <b>transplantation.</b> All macular edema resolved either with or without treatment.

40|$|Background. Surgical {{complications}} {{are a major}} disincentive to <b>pancreas</b> <b>transplantation,</b> {{despite the}} undisputed benefits of restored insulin independence. The da Vinci surgical system, a computer-assisted electromechanical device, provides the unique opportunity to test whether laparoscopy can reduce the morbidity of <b>pancreas</b> <b>transplantation.</b> Methods. <b>Pancreas</b> <b>transplantation</b> was performed by robot-assisted laparoscopy in three patients. The first patient received a pancreas after kidney transplant, the second a simultaneous <b>pancreas</b> kidney <b>transplantation,</b> and the third a pancreas transplant alone. Operations were carried out through an 11 -mm optic port, two 8 -mm operative ports, and a 7 -cm midline incision. The latter was used to introduce the grafts, enable vascular cross-clamping, and create exocrine drainage into the jejunum. Results. The two solitary pancreas transplants required an operating time of 3 and 5 hr, respectively; the simultaneous <b>pancreas</b> kidney <b>transplantation</b> took 8 hr. Mean warm ischemia time of the pancreas graft was 34 min. All pancreatic transplants functioned immediately, and all recipients became insulin independent. The kidney graft, revascularized after 35 min of warm ischemia, also functioned immediately. No patient had complications during or after surgery. At the longer follow-up of 10, 8, and 6 months, respectively, all recipients are alive with normal graft function. Conclusions. Wehave shown the feasibility of laparoscopic robot-assisted solitary pancreas and simultaneous <b>pancreas</b> and kidney <b>transplantation.</b> If the safety and feasibility of this procedure can be confirmed by larger series, laparoscopic robot-assisted <b>pancreas</b> <b>transplantation</b> could become a new option for diabetic patients needing beta-cell replacement...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pancreas</b> <b>transplantation</b> is {{the only}} therapy that can restore insulin {{independence}} in beta-cell penic diabetic recipients. Because {{of the need for}} life-long immunosuppression and the intial surgical risk associated with the transplant procedure, <b>Pancreas</b> <b>transplantation</b> is a therapeutic option only in selected diabetic patients. Based on renal function, three main populations of diabetic recipients of a pancreas transplant can be identified: uremic patients, posturemic patients (following successful kidney transplantation), and non-uremic patients. Uremic patients are best treated by simultaneous kidneypancreas transplantation with grafts obtained from the same deceased donor. Posturemic patients can receive a <b>pancreas</b> after kidney <b>transplantation,</b> if the previous renal graft has a good functional reserve. Non-uremic patients can receive a pancreas alone transplant if their diabetes is poorly controlled, despite optimal insulin therapy, suffer from unawareness hypoglycemia events and/or develop progressive chronic complications of diabetes. The results of <b>pancreas</b> <b>transplantation</b> have improved over the years and are currently not inferior to those of renal transplantation in non-diabetic recipients. A functioning pancreatic graft can prolong the life of diabetic recipients, improves their quality of life, and can halt, or reverse, the progression of chronic complications of diabetes. Unfortunately, because of ageing of donor population and lack of timely referral of potential recipients, the annual volume of pancreas transplants is declining.

Combined Pancreas-kidney transplantation is usually performed, but the value of pancreas after kidney transplant recently increased dramatically. Novel surgical techniques together with very effective immunosuppression (e. g.

40|$|<b>Pancreas</b> <b>{{transplantation}}</b> and islet of Langerhans transplantation {{are potential}} solutions to treat patients with type 1 diabetes. However, pancreas grafts are scarce {{and there is}} a shortage of donor pancreata relative to the number of patients needing a transplant. The aim of this thesis was to further optimize pancreas graft survival in <b>pancreas</b> <b>transplantation</b> and to optimize islet isolation outcomes in islet of Langerhans transplantation, leading to better use of available organs. The focus in <b>pancreas</b> <b>transplantation</b> should be on optimizing recipients to improve graft survival and on improving quality of pancreata procured by centers not performing <b>pancreas</b> <b>transplantation</b> (for example, by training procurement surgeons to optimize pancreas procurement, thereby increasing the number of transplantable organs. In islets transplantation, it is recommended that the reporting of donor, pancreas and isolation factors should become more standardized, which would enable us to determine more accurately which factors are important predictors for islet isolation outcome. Furthermore, if more biomedical factors (e. g. the presence of hyperemic islets) would be reported in addition to the other factors, we would be able to assess the independent effect of these biomedical factors for islet isolation outcome and eventually the effect on islet transplantation in the clinical setting.
