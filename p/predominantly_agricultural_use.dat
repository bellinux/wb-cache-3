500|$|Quarrington's medieval {{name was}} {{recorded}} in the Domesday Book as Corninctune or Cornunctone, from the Old English cweorn ("mill") and tun ("homestead"), meaning [...] "miller's homestead", reflecting {{the importance of the}} watermills which were built along the River Slea. Bardi had owned 10 mills in Sleaford and Quarrington before Domesday, and the 11 or 12 in existence by 1086 represents the largest cluster of mills in Lincolnshire. Mahany and Roffe suggest that Quarrington was a specialised part of his compact estate, geared in particular to milling. Excavations have revealed medieval pits and pottery in the village, with ditches reflecting a <b>predominantly</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>use</b> of the land. In the Lay Subsidy of 1334, Quarrington and Millthorpe were valued at £4 10s. 4½d., slightly below average for its wapentake.|$|E
50|$|Kenmore Farm is a {{historic}} farm and educational property at 369 Kenmore Road, just outside Amherst, Virginia. The centerpiece {{of the more than}} 130 acre property is aa c. 1856 brick Greek Revival farmhouse, built by Samuel Garland, Sr., a prominent local lawyer and politician. The property was used intermittently between 1872 and 1899 as a preparatory high school, operated by Henry Aubrey Strode, who later became the first president of Clemson University. As such, its building complex includes a dormitory and apartment building in addition to a variety of mainly agricultural outbuildings, among which are a corn crib and barn, and the remnants of an outdoor summer kitchen. The property has seen <b>predominantly</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>use</b> in the 20th century.|$|E

50|$|The Silver Lake {{area was}} first {{settled in the}} mid-18th century, and was <b>predominantly</b> <b>agricultural</b> in <b>use</b> until {{the arrival of the}} {{railroad}} at Chesham in 1880. Around 1886 Corban Farwell and Wellington Seaver, the major landowners around {{the southern end of the}} lake, began selling off lakefront lots, on which vacationers built modest cottages. Of the 37 cottages built before 1903, 35 are still standing. The architecture of most of them is best described as a vernacular Stick style, with siding that is either vertical planking, board-and-batten, or tongue-and-groove. Some houses have bands of decorative cut shingles, and most houses feature porches that wrap around at least two sides, and offer views of the lake or the mountains. Some houses have Gothic-style vergeboard decoration and trim elements.|$|R
40|$|From Imperial Dam downstream, in {{addition}} to Mexico, the Colorado River supplies water to Arizona and California for <b>predominantly</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>use.</b> In Arizona, the Colorado River is {{the major source of}} water supply to the various irrigation districts in the Yuma area. Due to legal constraints, the amount of Colorado River water available to the State of Arizona is limited. On the other hand, it was discovered that the amount of water applied to the soil in irrigation exceeds that amount needed for crop-growing. Two areas where the amount of water considerably exceeds the requirements, the mesa section of the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District and the Yuma Mesa Irrigation and Drainage District, were studied in detail. The excess water applied on the mesa of the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District flows into the Wellton-Mohawk Valley whence it is pumped into a conveyance channel and then discharged into the main channel of the Colorado River. This drain water has a very high salt content and therefore it adversely affects the quality of the river water. Since the drain water is discharged into the Colorado River above the point of diversion to Mexico and it is considered {{to be part of the}} Mexican water allotment, the quality of the Colorado River water has become a source of friction between the United States and the Republic of Mexico. The excess irrigation water from the Yuma Mesa Irrigation and Drainage District flows into the adjacent valleys as well as into uncultivated areas. In the adjacent valleys it is raising the water table and thus causing drainage problems. When it flows underground into the uncultivated lands, in large measure it constitutes a loss of water that otherwise could be put to beneficial use by Arizona. It is known that flood irrigation is not conducive to efficient application of water in the sandy soils that are predominant in these areas, and that the effects of this application of excess water are diverse and far-reaching. The change to sprinkler irrigation would be advantageous in many ways and beneficial to all concerned. The change to sprinkler irrigation on the mesa of the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District would benefit both the farmers and the district financially. At the same time, it would decrease the salinity of the Colorado River water, thereby improving the quality of the water that Mexico receives and, consequently, the relations between the United States and the Republic of Mexico. In the Yuma Mesa Irrigation and Drainage District, the change in the method of irrigation would increase the amount of water available for use by the State of Arizona. Furthermore, it would alleviate the drainage problem of the adjacent valleys and would thereby decrease the amount of drain water flowing back into the channel of the Colorado River. In this district, such a change may entail a small added cost to the farmer. Alternatives for augmenting the flow of the Colorado River, such as importation of water from other basins, desalting sea water, phreatophyte eradication, and evaporation suppression, were found to be economically unfeasible at present or still in the experimental stages...|$|E
5000|$|Until {{the nineteenth}} century, the Bulwark area was {{generally}} known as Hardwick, a name given to areas of cattle farming in Saxon times. It {{may be the}} [...] "hardwick" [...] mentioned in the Domesday Book {{under the name of}} Lamecare, though other sites have also been suggested. The area was <b>predominantly</b> in <b>agricultural</b> <b>use</b> until the twentieth century, with farms including Claypits, St Tecla, and Burnt Barn. The manor house, Hardwick House, was in existence in the 14th century and was rebuilt several times; it was later known as Hardwick Court. The house was demolished in the 1960s, and some of its grounds then became a public open space, known locally as [...] "Piggy's Hill". The area south of the A48 Newport Road contains a number of large 19th century villas which were on the outskirts of Chepstow when built, and commanded extensive views eastwards towards Sedbury. Nearby, on the road towards Mathern, Chepstow Cemetery was established in 1855, after the town’s churchyard was deemed to be overcrowded; it received its first burials two years later.|$|R

50|$|The {{ceremonial}} {{county of}} Lincolnshire {{is composed of}} the non-metropolitan county of Lincolnshire and the area covered by the unitary authorities of North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire. Therefore, part of the ceremonial county is in the Yorkshire and the Humber region of England, and most is in the East Midlands region. The county is the second-largest of the English ceremonial counties {{and one that is}} <b>predominantly</b> <b>agricultural</b> in land <b>use.</b> The county is fourth largest of the two-tier counties, as the unitary authorities of North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire are not included. The county can be broken down into a number of geographical sub-regions including: The rolling chalk hills of the Lincolnshire Wolds. In the south east are the Lincolnshire Fens (south-east Lincolnshire), the Carrs (similar to the Fens but in north Lincolnshire), the industrial Humber Estuary and North Sea coast around Grimsby and Scunthorpe, and in the south-west of the county, the Kesteven Uplands, comprising rolling limestone hills in the district of South Kesteven.|$|R

40|$|In {{an earlier}} {{research}} project, HR- 204, {{the magnitude and}} nature of highway related tort claims against counties in Iowa were investigated. However, {{virtually all of the}} claims identified in that research resulted from incidents that occurred in areas with <b>predominantly</b> <b>agricultural</b> land <b>use.</b> With recent increases in the rural non-farm population, many traditionally urban problems are also appearing in built-up areas under county jurisdiction. This trend is expected to continue so that counties must anticipate a change {{in the nature of the}} tort claims they will encounter. Problems that heretofore have been unique to cities may become commonplace in areas for which counties are responsible. The research reported here has been directed toward an investigation of those problems in rural subdivisions that lead to claims growing out of the provision of highway services by counties. Lacking a sufficient database among counties for the types of tort claims of interest in this research, a survey was sent to 259 cities in Iowa in order to identify highway related problems leading to those claims. The survey covered claims during a five year period from 1975 to 1980. Over one-third of the claims reported were based on alleged street defects. Another 34 percent of the claims contained allegations of damages due to backup of sanitary sewers or defects in sidewalks. By expanding the sample from the 164 cities that responded to the survey, it was estimated that a total of 49, 000, 000 in claims had been submitted to all 259 cities. Over 34...|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the development of tourism and its support from the Regional Operational Programme in the Vysočina Region. Tourism is one of the world's largest economic sectors. This sector is strongly associated with the place of its origin and is becoming an increasingly important factor in regional development. It has a positive effect on job creation, socio-economic development and investment activity in the region. The theoretical part of the thesis contains an approach of European regional policy, its objectives and financing. The thesis focuses on financing the development of tourism from the Regional Operational Programme South-East. The practical part consists of general information about the Vysočina Region and tourism development in the region. There is an analysis of two selected projects in the field of tourism in the Vysočina Region, which were financed from ROP South-East. The introductory information about the projects and the description of their nature is mentioned here (e. g. benefit of the projects, job creation and sustainability, target groups, project costs, amount of subsidy, etc.). In the thesis conclusion {{the current state of the}} problem is assessed. The tourism development in the Vysočina Region is gradually improving due to the subsidies from the ROP South-East. The number of jobs in this economic sector is growing. These results are based on an analysis of the selected projects and other projects of tourism posted on the Internet. One of the main opportunities for tourism development in the future in the Vysočina Region is agritourism and rural tourism. The absolute majority of the region is appropriate for these sectors of tourism due to the <b>predominantly</b> <b>agricultural</b> land <b>use</b> and clean, preserved nature...|$|R
