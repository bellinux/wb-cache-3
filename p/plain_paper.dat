25|$|The Benton Visual Retention Test (or simply Benton test or BVRT) is an {{individually}} administered {{test for}} people aged from {{eight years to}} adulthood that measures visual perception and visual memory. It {{can also be used}} to help identify possible learning disabilities among other afflictions that might affect an individual's memory. The individual examined is shown 10 designs, one at a time, and asked to reproduce each one as exactly as possible on <b>plain</b> <b>paper</b> from memory. The test is untimed, and the results are professionally scored by form, shape, pattern, and arrangement on the paper.|$|E

The MOT test number contained on the certificate gives access to the vehicle's current test status {{as well as its}} test history from 2005 onwards, via the DVSA web site. MOT certificates in Northern Ireland continue to be issued on paper, accompanied by a paper 'certificate disc' which must be displayed on the vehicle. Display of these discs has been mandatory on Northern Ireland tested cars since 2008. However, this was abolished in April 2015.|$|E

The books were released for the Christmas season, when sales would be sufficient to warrant print runs as large as 100,000. Later, collected editions of four works reprinted in a single volume were published. Throughout the late 1870s, Evans and Caldecott collaborated on 17books, considered Caldecott's best, and to have changed the [...] "course of children's illustrated books". Caldecott drew pen and ink illustrations on <b>plain</b> <b>paper</b> that were photographed to wood. Evans [...] "engraved in facsimile" [...] the illustration to the woodblock.

2500|$|Locke was cremated, and his remains {{turned over}} to Dr. Arthur Fauset, an {{anthropologist}} who was a major figure in the Harlem Renaissance. Fauset was Locke's close friend, and executor of his estate. Fauset died in 1983, and the remains were given to his friend, Reverend Sadie Mitchell. Mitchell ministered at African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas in Philadelphia. Mitchell retained the ashes until the mid-1990s, when she asked Dr. J. Weldon Norris, a professor of music at Howard University, to take the ashes to Washington, D.C. [...] The ashes then resided at Howard University's Moorland–Spingarn Research Center until 2007. Concerned that the human remains were not properly cared for, the ashes were given to Howard University's W. Montague Cobb Research Laboratory, which had extensive experience handling human remains. Locke's ashes, which were stored in a <b>plain</b> <b>paper</b> bag in a simple round metal container, were transferred to a more appropriate small funerary urn. They were locked in a safe to keep them secure.|$|E
2500|$|While it is {{possible}} to keep score using a pencil and <b>plain</b> <b>paper,</b> scorers often use pre-printed scoring books, and these are commercially available in many different styles. [...] Simple score books allow the recording of each batsman's runs, their scores and mode of dismissal, the bowlers' analyses, the team score and the score at the fall of each wicket. [...] More sophisticated score books allow for the recording of more detail, and other statistics such as the number of balls faced by each batsman. [...] Scorers also sometimes produce their own scoring sheets to suit their techniques, and some use coloured pens to highlight events such as wickets, or differentiate the actions of different batsmen or bowlers. [...] It is often possible to tell from a modern scorecard the time at which everything occurred, who bowled each delivery, which batsman faced it, whether the batsman left the ball or played and missed, or which direction the batsman hit the ball and whether runs were scored. [...] Sometimes details of occurrences between deliveries, or incidental details like the weather, are recorded.|$|E

Alternatively, a prescription may be handwritten on preprinted prescription forms that have been assembled into pads, or printed onto similar forms using a computer printer or even on <b>plain</b> <b>paper</b> according to the circumstance.

Prescriptions also contain directions for the patient to follow when taking the drug. These directions are printed on the label of the pharmaceutical product.|$|E
