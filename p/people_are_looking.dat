500|$|The first season's {{ratings were}} {{consistently}} high, ranking first in its timeslot and leading its closest competition by 7.2 million viewers. It delivered ABC's best audience retention following Desperate Housewives, {{was the highest}} rated show amongst 18- to 49-year-olds in 13 years since The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, and produced ABC's strongest series performance in the hour in more than four years. Commenting on the first season's high ratings, Magna Global USA media analyst Steve Sternberg stated: [...] "Roughly 80 percent of households during prime time only have one TV set on. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> for shows they can watch with other household members. And just as Desperate Housewives reaches a broad audience - younger, older, male, female - so does Grey's Anatomy." [...] The season finale was watched by 22.22 million viewers, and was ranked the ninth in viewership.|$|E
500|$|Grey Anatomy {{has been}} {{considered}} an impact on culture by Entertainment Weekly executive editor, Lori Majewski, with her writing: [...] "Grey's Anatomy isn't just a show, it's a phenomenon. When [...] final shows air, every place in New York City is empty. You could get a table at the best restaurants." [...] The Daily Beast Jace Lacob also considered the show an impact, comparing its success to that of Friends, and calling it a [...] "cultural phenomenon". Steve Sternberg, a media analyst with Magna Global USA explained that the show appeals to a broad audience, writing: [...] "Roughly 80 percent of households during prime time only have one TV set on. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> for shows they can watch with other household members." [...] Grey's Anatomy introduced a [...] "mc-labeling" [...] surge, ever since it dubbed Dempsey's character [...] "McDreamy". Canadian newspaper the National Post considers this trend a [...] "phenomenon".|$|E

[...] In 1974 she told Peter Knobler in Crawdaddy, [...] "People are always taking advantage of you; everybody that's interested in you has got an angle." ...|$|E

[...] "When <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> for information, {{we want to make sure}} they are getting great information," [...] says Gerbic on the Data Skeptic podcast.|$|E

The first three stores [...] located in the towns of Brockton, Somerville, and Malden, Massachusetts [...] were opened {{simultaneously}} on September 20 of that year. During the initial openings, Johnson & Wales University's marketing director, Mark Neckes, approved of AJWright; he stated that AJWright strengthens TJX's coverage of urban markets, an area [...] "where people need a place to shop [...] a place where retailers understand what <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> for".|$|E
2500|$|Wurzelbacher {{subsequently}} {{defended the}} video, stating that [...] "Different {{countries around the}} world have tried to disarm their citizens, and then have tried to exterminate their own now-unarmed citizens. If <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> to be offended by this video, they are probably serving a political agenda. Unfortunately {{there are a lot of}} whiners out there." [...] Wurzelbacher's spokesman, Phil Christofanelli, also defended the video, stating that Wurzelbacher was a [...] "student of history" [...] who knows that the Founding Fathers [...] "understood that the 2nd Amendment was always the people's last defense against tyrannical government." ...|$|E

50|$|With {{the unfortunate}} events of 9/11 <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> for {{something}} to bring their spirits up {{and there was nothing}} better than an album which was based on partying and having fun.

50|$|There <b>were</b> 5,842 <b>people</b> of {{employable}} age (between 16 and 74) in Winnersh, of whom 4,339 were in employment.

2500|$|Visconti, who {{accepted}} an interviewer's {{suggestion that he}} was Bowie's [...] "voice on earth", commented on the album to the international press and provided insights into the individual tracks. The songs cover {{a wide spread of}} subjects and are largely observational: most probe the mind-sets of different individuals. [...] "Valentine's Day" [...] is about a high school shooter. [...] "I'd Rather Be High" [...] related the story of a Second World War soldier. Visconti described the material as [...] "extremely strong and beautiful". He added [...] "if <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> for classic Bowie they'll find it on this album, if they're looking for innovative Bowie, new directions, they're going to find that on this album too." [...] Visconti commented that 29 tracks were recorded for the album and suggested that some of the material left out of The Next Day could appear on a subsequent record. Visconti speculated that Bowie could return to the studio to produce a new album later in 2013, but this did not happen.|$|E
2500|$|World War II shocked {{her into}} a more {{conventional}} belief: [...] "I believe if <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> for the truth, {{the truth of the}} Christian religion will come out and meet them." [...] And in the early 1950s, she thought she had a mystical revelation in France and actively tried to convert to Catholicism. There was a precedent in her family for this action, as her sister, Letitia, had earlier converted to Catholicism, thereby causing quite a stir. But West's attempt was short-lived, and she confessed to a friend: [...] "I could not go on with being a Catholic... I don't want, I can't bear to, become a Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, and I cannot believe that I am required to pay such a price for salvation." [...] Her writings of the 1960s and early 1970s again betray a profound mistrust towards God: [...] "The case against religion is the responsibility of God for the sufferings of mankind, which makes it impossible to believe the good things said about Him in the Bible, and consequently to believe anything it says about Him." ...|$|E

60|$|Myself I {{have a sort}} of {{consciousness}} that somewhere inside me there is quite a good player, if only I could persuade him to come out. He is shy, that is all. He does not seem able to play when <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> on. The shots he misses when <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> on would give you a wrong idea of him. When nobody is about, a prettier game you do not often see. If some folks who fancy themselves could see me when there is nobody about, it might take the conceit out of them. Only once I played up to what I feel is my real form, and then it led to argument. I was staying at an hotel in Switzerland, and the second evening a pleasant-spoken young fellow, who said he had read all my books--later, he appeared surprised on learning I had written more than two--asked me if I would care to play a hundred up. We played even, and I paid for the table. The next evening he said he thought it would make a better game if he gave me forty and I broke. It was a fairly close finish, and afterwards he suggested that I should put down my name for the handicap they were arranging.|$|E

The streets give you exactly that effect. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> about and listening.

60|$|Science has {{recently}} {{discovered that the}} ant does not lay up anything for winter use. This will knock him out of literature, to some extent. He does not work, except when <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking,</b> and only then when the observer has a green, naturalistic look, {{and seems to be}} taking notes. This amounts to deception, and will injure him for the Sunday-schools. He has not judgment enough to know what is good to eat from what isn't. This amounts to ignorance, and will impair the world's respect for him. He cannot stroll around a stump and find his way home again. This amounts to idiocy, and once the damaging fact is established, thoughtful people will cease to look up to him, the sentimental will cease to fondle him. His vaunted industry is but a vanity and of no effect, since he never gets home with anything he starts with. This disposes of the last remnant of his reputation and wholly destroys his main usefulness as a moral agent, since it will make the sluggard hesitate to go to him any more. It is strange, beyond comprehension, that so manifest a humbug as the ant has been able to fool so many nations and keep it up so many ages without being found out.|$|E
