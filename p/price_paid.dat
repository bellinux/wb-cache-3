5|$|With feed-in tariffs, the {{financial}} burden falls upon the consumer. They reward the number of kilowatt-hours produced {{over a long period}} of time, but because the rate is set by the authorities, it may result in perceived overpayment. The <b>price</b> <b>paid</b> per kilowatt-hour under a feed-in tariff exceeds the price of grid electricity. Net metering refers to the case where the <b>price</b> <b>paid</b> by the utility is the same as the price charged.|$|E
40|$|The {{differences}} in <b>prices</b> <b>paid</b> and <b>prices</b> received by farmers are examined using cointegration analysis. A Johansen cointegration test between <b>prices</b> <b>paid</b> and <b>prices</b> received {{revealed that the}} series were cointegrated.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{examines}} the dynamics in <b>prices</b> <b>paid</b> in “pay-what-you-want” situations over multiple customer–seller transactions {{on an individual}} customer level. The analysis of potential dynamism in <b>prices</b> <b>paid</b> allows for {{an assessment of the}} profitability of pay-what-you-want pricing for sellers of frequently bought products and services. To empirically validate the framework, the authors conduct a field study that focuses on the aggregate and individual dynamics in <b>prices</b> <b>paid</b> over customers’ multiple purchases. Using latent growth modeling, the authors find significant but declining decreases in <b>prices</b> <b>paid.</b> Further, they identify stable individual and relational difference factors which predict steeper or more gradual declines in <b>prices</b> <b>paid.</b> Customers’ individual preferences for fairness and price consciousness as well as their overall satisfaction with the seller alleviate price declines. The authors discuss the practical and theoretical implications of these findings...|$|R

5|$|It is {{believed}} that only 12 copies have survived of Poe's first book Tamerlane and Other Poems. In December 2009, one copy sold at Christie's, New York for $662,500, a record <b>price</b> <b>paid</b> for a work of American literature.|$|E
5|$|From their {{discovery}} by numismatists, 1804 dollars have commanded high prices. Auction prices reached $1,000 by 1885, {{and in the}} mid-twentieth century, {{the coins}} realized over $30,000. In 1999, a Class I example sold for $4.14 million, then the highest <b>price</b> <b>paid</b> for any coin. Their high value has caused 1804 dollars to be a frequent target of counterfeiting and other methods of deception.|$|E
5|$|In March 1383, Carrouges made a third {{effort to}} expand his family holdings, with the {{purchase}} of the neighbouring fiefs of Cuigny and Plainville from his neighbour Sir Jean de Vauloger. The sale required approval from Count Pierre, who was overlord of both fiefs, but as consequence of the previous legal difficulties Carrouges had caused him, Pierre refused to permit the sale and insisted that Carrouges turn the properties over to him in exchange for a full refund of the original <b>price</b> <b>paid.</b> Carrouges {{had no choice but to}} comply and subsequently blamed Jacques Le Gris' influence for this new misfortune.|$|E

40|$|Industrial {{organization}} theory hypothesizes {{that larger}} beefpackers can depress <b>prices</b> <b>paid</b> for cattle. <b>Prices</b> <b>paid</b> between {{at least two}} beefpackers in some localized markets studied {{were found to be}} significantly different for the one-month study period. However, larger beefpackers in each market paid neither lower or higher prices than the smallest buyer, with just one exception. No significant relationship was found between market shares of buyers and average <b>prices</b> <b>paid</b> for cattle. Thus, the hypothesis that larger beefpackers pay significantly lower prices was rejected. There is a clear lack of concensus among agricultural economists regarding whether or not the beefpacking industry is competitive [Ahmaddaud, et al.; Connor; Hall, et al.; Multop and Helmuth; Schnittker Associates...|$|R
40|$|The {{macroeconomic}} {{effects on}} agricultural {{prices in the}} Greek economy and, in particular, differences in <b>prices</b> <b>paid</b> and received by farmers (cost-price squeeze) are examined employing integration and cointegration analysis. A Johansen cointegration test between <b>prices</b> <b>paid</b> and <b>prices</b> received by farmers supports the presence of cost-price squeeze, since non-cointegration between the two price indices cannot be rejected. In other words, <b>prices</b> <b>paid</b> by farmers respond more than prices received by farmers during inflationary periods and hence affect their parity ratio. Multivariate cointegration tests indicated that forces outside agriculture can explain the non-cointegration between farm input and output prices. These forces are monetary macro variables through the country's macroeconomic policy, such as money supply, the general price level and the domestic product. ...|$|R
5|$|The LS 460 and LS 460 L {{arrived at}} dealerships in Japan, the U.S., and Europe in late 2006, and the vehicle reached Australia, East Asia, and the Middle East in 2007. The U.S. base {{prices for the}} 2007 LS 460 and LS 460 L were US$61,000 and US$71,000, respectively. In 2006 and 2007, the average <b>price</b> <b>paid</b> for U.S. market LS 460 L sedans {{exceeded}} US$80,000, due largely to added options packages, placing the Lexus LS in the same average price range as its long-wheelbase Audi, BMW, and Jaguar rivals for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The price {{reached an}} all-time high in 1999, when the finest known specimen, graded Proof-68 by the Professional Coin Grading Service, which is {{believed}} to have been the example presented to Said bin Sultan, was auctioned by Bowers and Merena for $4,140,000. At the time of the sale, this was the highest <b>price</b> <b>paid</b> for any coin. In 2008, a Class I example was sold by Heritage Auctions for $3,737,500, and a Class III was sold by the same firm for $2,300,000 in 2009.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Prices</b> <b>paid</b> {{index is}} an index that {{measures}} {{changes in the}} <b>prices</b> <b>paid</b> {{for goods and services}} used in crop and livestock production and family living. The production component of the index accounts for over 65% of the total, and family living expenses represented by the CPI-U account for less than 20% of the index. The remaining components are interest charges on farm real estate and non-real estate debt, taxes payable on farm real estate, and wage rates paid to hired farm labor. NASS currently publishes the index on a 1990-92 = 100 base. Used in calculating the federal grazing fee, among other purposes. The index of <b>prices</b> <b>paid</b> on a 1910-14 = 100 base is called the parity index and is used in calculating the parity ratio.|$|R

50|$|Commercial fishing {{remains an}} {{important}} part of the Dillingham economy, but <b>prices</b> <b>paid</b> for salmon vary due to international competition, especially from fish farming operations in Chile, Norway, Canada and elsewhere. <b>Prices</b> <b>paid</b> Bristol Bay fishermen for sockeye salmon peaked at $2.11 per pound in 1988 but fell to just $0.42 per pound in 2001. Prices have since rebounded due to techniques to improve fish quality and enhanced marketing efforts, and were up to $1.50 per pound in 2013.|$|R
5|$|Nadodi Mannan was {{released}} on 22 August 1958. The expenses made for the film resulted in Ramachandran not having {{enough money to buy}} release prints. Hence, Veerappan and Chakrapani decided to acquire a legal loan of 50,000 from AVM Productions. However, Ramachandran's signature was required for the loan contract. When they consulted with him on this issue, he asked Veerappan and Chakrapani to tell the studio's founder A. V. Meiyappan that they would repay the loan and keep the <b>price</b> <b>paid</b> by the production company, Cinemas Limited, for distribution rights for the film's release in Sri Lanka as collateral. Meiyappan agreed to provide the loan, which was repaid by Veerappan immediately after the film's release.|$|E
5|$|The HBC {{drastically}} reduced the <b>price</b> <b>paid</b> for furs, by 50% in many cases. By this time, however, the fur trade was in decline, {{both on the}} coast and the continent, due to a general depletion of fur-bearing animals, along with {{a reduction in the}} demand for beaver pelts. A financial panic in 1837 resulted in a general slump in the fur and China trade, bringing an end to a half-century boom. During the 1840s, the HBC closed most of their coastal trading posts, leaving the coast trade to just Fort Simpson and the Beaver, with the new depot at Fort Victoria anchoring the southern coast.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War, Waddington was {{appointed}} chairman of the North Eastern Division Advisory Committee for the Control of Oils and Fats and became an agent of the Ministry of Food. His responsibilities included arranging for the storage of fats. When the war concluded, he was charged with conspiracy to defraud the Ministry of Food when it was discovered that a letter detailing amounts of money had been altered. The prosecution alleged that between 1943 and 1944, Waddington and the manager of another fat storage firm shared £1,600 between them which should have gone to the latter's company when the <b>price</b> <b>paid</b> by the Ministry for storage increased. Waddington denied all knowledge; his brother Priestley, another director at the family firm, said that he made the arrangements to pay a portion of the increased fees to Waddington's co-defendant without the knowledge of Waddington. Waddington was acquitted when a judge ruled {{that there was no way}} that it could be proven that he had known of the alteration to the letter, or that he was in any way responsible.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{the only}} {{galleries}} who {{were prepared to}} show the so-called New York School (Robert Motherwell's term) were Parsons Gallery, the Samuel Kootz Gallery and the Charles Egan Gallery. To these fledgling galleries it was a financial disaster. The highest <b>price</b> <b>paid</b> for a Pollock, before 1947, was $740 and Rothko had peaked with {{the sale of a}} $120 painting in 1946. At the Kootz Gallery, from 1946 to 1948, Hans Hoffman, William Baziotes and Robert Motherwell were offered at between $100 and $950, likely fetching much lower actual sales prices. Kootz closed in 1948 {{as a result of the}} financial strain. The critical and financial success of the group would only come after a series of popularising articles in Life magazine, most notably a feature on Jackson Pollock in 1949 and the Irascibles article and photograph of 1951.|$|E
5|$|Kahaani was {{released}} on 9 March 2012, a day after International Women's Day. It played on 1100 screens worldwide. CNN-IBN reported that although Kahaani was ready before The Dirty Picture, distributors deferred its release, fearing that Vidya's role of a sexy siren (in The Dirty Picture) after that of a pregnant woman might not be received well. STAR TV bought the exclusive right to broadcast the film for a price of , which was the highest-ever <b>price</b> <b>paid</b> for a female-centric film in India. The Indian television premiere of the film was on Star India's channel Movies OK on 3 June 2012. The DVD of the film {{was released}} on 17 May 2012 across all regions in a one-disc pack in NTSC format. Distributed by Shemaroo Entertainment, it contained additional content, such as behind-the-scene footage, video of celebration parties after its theatrical release, and music videos of the songs of the film. The VCD and Blu-ray versions were released at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Green {{ran into}} {{problems}} with Go Man Go's registration. At that time, the AQHA had {{two types of}} registration, the Appendix and the Tentative. Appendix-registered horses were the offspring of Thoroughbreds and either Tentative-registered Quarter Horses or Appendix-registered Quarter Horses. Go Man Go was originally registered in the Appendix, as his dam was an Appendix-registered mare. The way to advance out of the Appendix into the Tentative registry was to qualify on performance grounds and pass a conformation examination conducted by the AQHA. Go Man Go certainly qualified under the performance criteria, but his conformation was such that he resembled a Thoroughbred more than he resembled a Quarter Horse. Green knew {{that in order to}} increase his stud fees—the <b>price</b> <b>paid</b> for the right to breed a mare to a stallion—Go Man Go needed to acquire a regular registration number instead of his Appendix number. So Green appealed to the Executive Committee of the AQHA, which had the authority to award Tentative numbers to horses regardless of conformation exam results. In both 1956 and 1957, the committee declined to take action, waiting to evaluate the quality of Go Man Go's first foals before making a decision. Finally, in 1958, they awarded Go Man Go number 82,000 in the Tentative registry.|$|E

5|$|In {{cases of}} self {{consumption}} of the solar energy, the payback time {{is calculated based on}} how much electricity is not purchased from the grid. For example, in Germany, with electricity prices of 0.25 €/kWh and insolation of 900 kWh/kW, one kWp will save €225 per year, and with an installation cost of 1700 €/KWp the system cost will be returned in less than seven years. However, in many cases, the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide, and {{some or all of the}} energy is fed back into the grid. The electricity is sold, and at other times when energy is taken from the grid, electricity is bought. The relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics. In many markets, the <b>price</b> <b>paid</b> for sold PV electricity is significantly lower than the price of bought electricity, which incentivizes self consumption. Moreover, separate self consumption incentives have been used in e.g. Germany and Italy. Grid interaction regulation has also included limitations of grid feed-in in some regions in Germany with high amounts of installed PV capacity. By increasing self consumption, the grid feed-in can be limited without curtailment, which wastes electricity.|$|E
5|$|With {{the fair}} closed, the {{question}} remained {{what to do}} with the some 4,600,000 half dollars which had not been sold. Organizers did not wish them to be issued, to preserve the premium <b>price</b> <b>paid</b> by purchasers. Those remaining in the Company's hands were redeemed by the Mint, which melted them; the fee for this service was forgiven by act of Congress. The coins which had been impounded by the Treasury were offered for sale at face value beginning in October 1894; when there were few takers, they were released into circulation. A million coins held by the Chicago banks were also placed in circulation. Although 2,501,700 half dollars were melted (all dated 1893), this still left a like number of Columbians in public hands. Coin dealer and numismatic historian Q. David Bowers recalls that when he began collecting coins as a boy in the 1950s, the Columbians were among the most common 19th-century pieces remaining in circulation. It was not until the 1930s that the pieces, in uncirculated condition, commanded the original price of $1. Prices began to rise as silver coins were replaced by base metal ones in the 1960s. In the 2012 version of Yeoman's catalog, both pieces are listed at under $20 in almost uncirculated (AU-50) condition, with specimens in near-pristine MS-66 selling for over a thousand dollars.|$|E

40|$|Pay {{what you}} want (PWYW) is a new {{participative}} pricing mechanism in which consumers have maximum control over the price they pay. Previous {{research has suggested that}} participative pricing increases consumers' intent to purchase. However, sellers using PWYW face the risk that consumers will exploit their control and pay nothing at all or a price below the seller's costs. In three field studies, the authors find that <b>prices</b> <b>paid</b> are significantly greater than zero. They analyze factors that influence <b>prices</b> <b>paid</b> and show that PWYW can even lead to an increase in seller revenues...|$|R

The difference is between actual <b>prices</b> <b>paid,</b> and information about possible, potential or likely prices, or [...] "average" [...] price levels.
