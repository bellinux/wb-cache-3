The Jaguar XJ220 had attracted a significant number of speculators who hoped the scarcity of the XJ220 and enthusiasm for the Jaguar marque would push up prices overnight, allowing large <b>profits</b> <b>to</b> be made over a short period of time.|$|E

5|$|Gray {{was born}} in Sauquoit, New York, on November 18, 1810, to Moses Gray (b.February26, 1786), then a tanner, and Roxanna Howard Gray (b. March 15, 1789). Born {{in the back of}} his father's tannery, Gray was the eldest of their eight children. Gray's {{paternal}} great-grandfather had arrived in Boston from Northern Ireland in 1718; Gray's Scotch-Irish Presbyterian ancestors had moved to New York from Massachusetts and Vermont after Shays' Rebellion. His parents married on July30, 1809. Tanneries needed a lot of wood to burn, and the lumber supply in the area had been shrinking, so Gray's father used his <b>profits</b> <b>to</b> buy farms in the area, and in about 1823 sold the tannery and became a farmer.|$|E

After the Board of Film Censors reviewed and approved Money No Enough, distributor Shaw Organisation released the film on 21 screens on 7 May 1998 and 18 April 2008. The success of the movie led to a dispute between Neo and Producer over their shares of the <b>profits.</b> <b>To</b> mark its tenth anniversary, Money No Enough was released in cinemas again and {{was followed by a}} sequel, Money No Enough 2.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} the 1745 Jacobite rising {{decimated}} the antiquated social structure based around clans lorded over by chieftains. This liberalized the Scottish way of life by allowing citizens to own land and keep the profits instead of giving all <b>profits</b> <b>to</b> the chieftains who owned all the land. Their literate foundation allowed the Scots to become economically literate {{and take advantage of}} trade. Edinburgh and Glasgow became epicenters of intellectual thought. There existed in Scotland a clergy who believed that a moral and religious foundation was required for, and compatible with, a free and open sophisticated culture, which moderated hardline conservatives. Herman presents biographies of Francis Hutcheson, Henry Home (Lord Kames), Robert Adam, Adam Smith, and others to illustrate the Scottish development.|$|E

5|$|After year-long {{expectations}} that the ninth season {{would be the}} series' last, NBC signed a deal in late December 2002 to bring the series back for a final tenth season. The series' creative team {{did not want to}} extend negotiations into the next year, and wanted to start writing the rest of the ninth-season episodes and a potential series finale. NBC agreed to pay $10million to Warner Bros. for the production of each tenth-season episode, the highest price in television history for a 30-minute series. Although NBC was unable to bring in enough advertising revenue from commercials to cover the costs, the series was integral to the Thursday night schedule, which brought high ratings and <b>profits</b> <b>to</b> the other television series. The cast demanded that the tenth season be reduced from the usual 24 episodes to 18 episodes to allow them to work on outside projects.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century, {{scientific}} investigation began to indicate that the Glamorgan valleys were rich with coal deposits. Bute, who already owned coal mines in County Durham, commissioned further surveys in 1817 and 1823–24 which showed that there were potentially huge <b>profits</b> <b>to</b> be made from the reserves, both from the coal sitting beneath Bute's own lands, but also from the coal under common lands in the region that Bute could claim through his feudal titles. Bute set about consolidating his rights and existing investments during the late 1820s and 1830s, acquiring extensive rights to the coalfields in the process. Bute established and managed a few colleries – such as that at Rhigos – directly, but given the investment costs and attention they took up, generally preferred to lease out his coal fields and claim a royalty on the coal mined instead. The lessees might be iron-masters, who used the coal in their own operations, or colliery owners who sold the coal on to industrial or domestic customers. The profits increased from £872 {{in the second half of}} 1826, to £10,756 in 1848–49.|$|E
5|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1970s, Nigeria {{accumulated}} a significant foreign debt to finance major infrastructural investments. With the fall of oil prices during the 1980s oil glut Nigeria struggled {{to keep up with}} its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased the size of the debt. After negotiations by the Nigeria authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its Paris Club creditors reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil <b>profits</b> <b>to</b> pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15billion annually for poverty reduction programmes. Nigeria made history in April 2006 by becoming the first African country to completely pay off its debt (estimated $30billion) owed to the Paris Club.|$|E
5|$|The Philadelphia Mint coined 200,112 half {{dollars in}} October 1920, with the excess above the round number {{reserved}} for {{inspection and testing}} at the 1921 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. They were shipped to the National Shawmut Bank of Boston which sold the coins for $1 each to the public, with the <b>profits</b> <b>to</b> go to the tercentenary commission. The coins could be ordered through any bank in Boston or Plymouth. Swiatek believed the sale of 1920-dated coins to have been very successful, {{and there was no}} thought at that time of returning any to the Mint for redemption and melting. The first order had not exhausted the authorized mintage, so the tercentenary commission ordered 100,000 more during the spring of 1921 when sales slowed. These were coined in July, together with 53 pieces held for the 1922 Assay Commission, and they have the year of issue added on the obverse to the left of Bradford. This was done to comply with the Coinage Act of 1873, which required the year of striking to appear on coins. The recession of 1921 began soon after; sales dropped, {{and tens of thousands of}} both dates remained unsold. The tercentenary commission returned 48,000 of the 1920 issue and 80,000 of the 1921 to the Mint.|$|E
