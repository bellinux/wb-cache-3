40|$|New {{enforcement}} strategies allow {{agents to}} gain the regulator’s trust and consequently face a lower audit probability. Prior research suggests that, {{in order to prevent}} lower compli-ance, a reduction in the audit probability (the “carrot”) must be compensated with the intro-duction of a higher <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> <b>non-compliance</b> (the “stick”). However, such carrot-and-stick strategies reflect neither the concept of trust nor the strategies observed in practice. In re-sponse to this, we define trust-based regulation as a strategy that incorporates rules that allow trust to develop, and using a generic (non-cooperative) game of tax compliance, we examine whether trust-based regulation is feasible (i. e., whether, in equilibrium, a reduction in the audit probability, without ever increasing the <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> <b>non-compliance,</b> does not lead to reduced compliance). The model shows that trust-based regulation is feasible when the agent sufficiently values the future. In line with the concept of trust, this strategy is feasi-ble when the regulator is uncertain about the agent’s intentions. Moreover, the model shows that (i) introducing higher penalties makes trust-based regulation less feasible, and (ii) combining trust and forgiveness can lead to a lower audit probability for both trusted and distrusted agents. Policy recommendations often point toward increasing deterrence. This model shows that the opposite can be optimal...|$|R

We are not speaking of children, or of young persons below the age which the law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood. Those who are still in a state to require being taken care of by others, must be protected against their own actions as well as against external injury. For the same reason, we may leave out of consideration those backward states of society in which the race itself may be considered as in its nonage. The early difficulties in the way of spontaneous progress are so great, that there is seldom any choice of means for overcoming them; and a ruler full of the spirit of improvement is warranted in the use of any expedients that will attain an end, perhaps otherwise unattainable. Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end. Liberty, as a principle, has no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion. Until then, there is nothing for them but implicit obedience to an Akbar or a Charlemagne, if they are so fortunate as to find one.

40|$|Abstract: Uniform {{regulatory}} standards, frequently {{employed in}} environmental health and safety, are widely criticized as inefficient {{on the grounds that}} all firms are required to comply, regardless of compliance cost. Since firms will self-select to comply only if their compliance costs exceed the expected <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> <b>non-compliance,</b> the inefficiency could be avoided by an enforcement policy chosen to maximize social welfare. But we argue that the enforcement agency goal is likely to place a larger weight on the benefits of compliance than on the costs of compliance, which will produce distortions. We show that the legislature can reduce the resulting distortions by limiting the enforcement agency budget and by permitting the agenc artially to self-finance, by retaining a portion of its noncompliance penalties. Finally, ifthe enforcement agency has a good "signal " of firms' compliance costs, the distortions can be made very small by appropriate choice of the enforcement budget...|$|R

Coal-based thermal power plants are the major emitters of particulate matter in India. The lack of severe <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with the standards has worsened the situation and thus calls for an immediate need for investment in technologies to regulate particulate emissions. My dissertation studies the optimal investment decisions in a dynamic framework, for a random sample of forty Indian coal-based power plants to abate particulate emissions. I used Linear Programming to solve the double cost minimization problem for the optimal choices of coal, boiler and pollution-control equipment. A policy analysis is done to choose over various tax policies, which would induce the firms to adopt the energy efficient as well as cost efficient technology. The aim here is to reach the WHO standards. Using the optimal switching point model I show that in a dynamic set up, switching the boiler immediately is always the cost effective option for all the power plants even if there is no policy restriction. The switch to a baghouse depends upon the policy in place. Theoretically, even though an emission tax is considered the most efficient tax, an ash tax or a coal tax can also be considered to be a good substitute especially in countries like India where monitoring costs are very high. As SPM is a local pollutant the analysis here is mainly firm specific. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{some aspects}} of the economics of the Australian Federal Governments Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET) policy with a special reference to Queensland. The objective of this policy is to increase the market share of renewable energy technologies in the Electricity Supply Industry (ESI) in Australia. The Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) market was established to achieve the desired market share of renewable energy technologies. These certificates are issued to renewable energy generators for each megawatt hour of eligible renewable electricity produced by generators. In Australia, electricity retailers and other large consumers of electricity have to buy a certain amount of RECs and then surrender RECs to the renewable energy regulator in order to comply with the policy. If retailers and other large consumers of electricity do not have the required amount of RECs by a certain day they have to pay a specified penalty. Renewable energy technologies are less emission intensive than conventional fossil-fuel electricity generation technologies. Therefore, the increased market share of renewable energy technologies is expected to result in reduced emissions from the electricity industry and corresponding improvements in environmental quality. The problem, however, is that private costs of producing electricity from renewable energy technologies are in general more expensive than private costs of producing electricity from conventional fossil-fuel generation technologies. Further, the recent structural reforms of the Australian electricity sector and removal of legal barriers to entry in generation have contributed to the private cost advantage which fossil - fuel electricity generation has in general over renewable technologies. This thesis investigates the options available to policymakers to internalise externalities in the ESI, the cost of emissions from the ESI, and benefits of increasing the market share of renewable energy technologies. It also looks at the renewable energy policies adopted in various countries. The thesis presents simulation models examining the impact of the MRET policy {{as if it were a}} state based scheme adopted by the state of Queensland. Models also illustrate how a carbon tax can change the merit order of the Queensland ESI. It highlights the advantages and disadvantages of the MRET policy. This thesis looks at the supply side by examining main components and effects of the Australian MRET policy including, using the methodology of experimental economics, the effects of the <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> <b>non-compliance</b> in the context of a specific market structure. Increasing the market share of the renewable energy technologies is also approached from the demand side. This thesis examines consumers willingness to pay (WTP) to protect the environment. Important influences on WTP higher prices in order to protect the environment were analysed on the international and Australian levels using the 1993 and 2000 International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) data and the Australian data from the 2003 Australian Survey of Social Attitudes (AuSSA). This thesis also employs a contingent valuation survey that was developed to determine the extent to which consumers are willing to pay to protect the environment, to support the MRET policy and to pay for electricity generated from renewable energy. The contingent valuation survey was administered in Queensland. The simulation results indicated that there were enough available low cost renewable energy resources (such as biomass) in Queensland if the state were to adopt the Federal Governments MRET scheme policy objectives and policy instruments (such as RECs market and a <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> <b>non-compliance)</b> as a state scheme. However, it is unlikely that all these resources will be employed due to several factors (e. g., the seasonal nature of some of the biomass resources, such as waste from sugar mills). Therefore the price of RECs could be quite high and just below the penalty. It was also concluded that the presence of a <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> <b>non-compliance</b> in the RECs market can lead to a high RECs price. Wrong market price signals could lead to inefficient investments in renewable energy technologies. Several important results emerged from the analysis of WTP for the protection of the environment: 1) in most countries considered, marginal willingness to pay to protect the environment was less in 2000, than in 1993; 2) respondents were more inclined to state that they were willing to pay higher prices in order to protect the environment than they were to pay higher taxes; 3) respondents were more reluctant to pay for an environmental good if the good is provided on a very large scale, such as the global environment, compared with an environmental good provided on a small scale which impacts mainly the local environment; 4) WTP to protect the environment is associated strongly with perceptions of the risk of environmental destruction; and 5) although there are many similarities among the characteristics of the consumers in different countries who are willing to pay more for environmental protection, the country specific research is required to account for local specifics. The analysis of the data obtained by the Queensland survey showed that the demand side can support some investments in low cost renewable energy technologies. Consumers indicated a strong preference for voluntary support of support renewable energy technologies compared with the mandatory support as required by the MRET policy. Policy recommendations are presented...|$|R
