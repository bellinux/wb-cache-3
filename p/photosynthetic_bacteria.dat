5|$|A diatom floristic {{study of}} the lagoon {{revealed}} that it contains 41 species and is a rich storehouse of psychrophilic <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>bacteria.</b> The heterotrophic bacterial microbiota and the ecology of <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>bacteria</b> of the Lake Burton were studied in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the findings indicate that salinity levels increase from below the ice level towards the lake bottom resulting in dense waters and that the environmental conditions, presence of light in summer, darkness during winter, and oxic and anoxic water status of the lake waters dictated the growth of bacterial phototrophs.|$|E
5|$|In prokaryotes endomembranes are rare, {{although}} in many <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>bacteria</b> the plasma membrane is highly folded {{and most of}} the cell cytoplasm is filled with layers of light-gathering membrane. These light-gathering membranes may even form enclosed structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria.|$|E
5|$|In many organisms {{the capture}} of solar energy is similar in {{principle}} to oxidative phosphorylation, as it involves the storage of energy as a proton concentration gradient. This proton motive force then drives ATP synthesis. The electrons needed to drive this electron transport chain come from light-gathering proteins called photosynthetic reaction centres or rhodopsins. Reaction centers are classed into two types {{depending on the type}} of photosynthetic pigment present, with most <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>bacteria</b> only having one type, while plants and cyanobacteria have two.|$|E

40|$|In vivo and {{in vitro}} methylation, {{methanol}} production assays, {{and the use}} of specific antibodies raised against the sensory transducing protein Tar in Escherichia coli all failed to demonstrate the presence of methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) in the <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>bacterium</b> Rhodobacter sphaeroides, although such proteins did exist in another <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>bacterium,</b> Rhodospirillum rubrum. The range of chemicals to which Rhodobacter sphaeroides responds, the lack of an all-or-none response, and the lack of true repellents indicate an alternative chemosensory pathway. The existence of MCPs in Rhodospirillum rubrum means that the lack of MCPs is not the result of a phototrophic metabolism, but may be connected to the unidirectional flagellar motor of Rhodobacter sphaeroides...|$|R
5|$|Many {{important}} biochemical reactions, such {{as energy}} generation, use concentration gradients across membranes. The {{general lack of}} internal membranes in bacteria means reactions such as electron transport occur across the cell membrane between the cytoplasm and the periplasmic space. However, in many <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>bacteria</b> the plasma membrane is highly folded and fills most of the cell with layers of light-gathering membrane. These light-gathering complexes may even form lipid-enclosed structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria. Other proteins import nutrients across the cell membrane, or expel undesired molecules from the cytoplasm.|$|E
5|$|The {{heterotrophic}} bacterial microbiota and {{the ecology}} of <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>bacteria</b> of the Lake Burton have been studied in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the findings indicate that salinity levels increase from below the ice level towards the lake bottom resulting in dense waters, the microbiota activity caused depletion of oxygen, separate water bodies of distinct chemistry got formed, the intervening chemical gradients have created niches for colonization by unique microbial communities and 68 bacteria were isolated.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{profound}} geobiological event is the introduction of oxygen into the atmosphere by <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>bacteria.</b> This oxygenation of Earth's primoidial atmosphere (the so-called oxygen catastrophe or Great Oxygenation Event) and the oxygenation of the oceans altered surface biogeochemical cycles {{and the types of}} organisms that have been evolutionarily selected for.|$|E
25|$|Carotenoids like {{lycopene}} {{are important}} pigments found in photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes in plants, <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>bacteria,</b> fungi, and algae. They {{are responsible for}} the bright orangered colors of fruits and vegetables, perform various functions in photosynthesis, and protect photosynthetic organisms from excessive light damage. Lycopene is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of many important carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, and xanthophylls.|$|E
25|$|Photosynthetic endosymbionts inhabit many {{tropical}} sponges, {{and these}} require light to survive. Certain sponges {{as a result}} depend on light availability and intensity tdiko achieve their nutritional needs.

40|$|AbstractThe gene {{transfer}} agent (GTA) is a phage-like particle capable of exchanging double-stranded DNA fragments between {{cells of the}} <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>bacterium</b> Rhodobacter capsulatus. Here we show that the major capsid protein of GTA, expressed in E. coli, can be assembled into prohead-like structures {{in the presence of}} calcium ions in vitro. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of uranyl acetate staining material and thin sections of glutaraldehyde-fixed material demonstrates that these associates have spherical structures with diameters in the range of 27 – 35  nm. The analysis of scanning TEM images revealed particles of mass ∼ 4. 3  MDa, representing 101 ± 11 copies of the monomeric subunit. The establishment of this simple and rapid method to form prohead-like particles permits the GTA system to be used for genome manipulation within the <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>bacterium,</b> for specific targeted drug delivery, and for the construction of biologically based distributed autonomous sensors for environmental monitoring...|$|R
25|$|Protochlorophyllide, or monovinyl protochlorophyllide, is an {{immediate}} precursor of chlorophyll a that lacks the phytol side-chain of chlorophyll. Protochlorophyllide is highly fluorescent; mutants that accumulate it glow red if irradiated with blue light. In angiosperms, the last step, conversion of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyll, is light-dependent, and such plants are pale (chlorotic) if {{grown in the}} darkness. Gymnosperms, algae, and <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>bacteria</b> have another, light-independent enzyme and grow green in the darkness as well.|$|E
25|$|Several other heterocycles {{are related}} to porphyrins. These include corrins, chlorins, bacteriochlorophylls, and corphins. Chlorins (2,3-dihydroporphyrin) are more reduced, contain more {{hydrogen}} than porphyrins, i.e. one pyrrole has been converted to a pyrroline. This structure occurs in chlorophylls. Replacement {{of two of the}} four pyrrolic subunits with pyrrolinic subunits results in either a bacteriochlorin (as found in some <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>bacteria)</b> or an isobacteriochlorin, depending on the relative positions of the reduced rings. Some porphyrin derivatives follow Hückel's rule, but most do not.|$|E
25|$|Plants and <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{naturally}} produce all-trans lycopene. When {{exposed to}} light or heat, lycopene can undergo isomerization {{to any of}} a number of cis-isomers, which have a bent rather than linear shape. Different isomers were shown to have different stabilities due to their molecular energy (highest stability: 5-cis ≥ all-trans ≥ 9-cis ≥ 13-cis > 15-cis > 7-cis > 11-cis: lowest). In the human bloodstream, various cis-isomers constitute more than 60% of the total lycopene concentration, but the biological effects of individual isomers have not been investigated.|$|E
40|$|The {{carotenoid}} photopigment {{genes of}} the purple nonsulfur <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>bacterium</b> Rhodospeudomonas sphaeroides have been cloned into the kanamycin resistance transposon Tn 5 {{to create a}} carotenoid transposon-Tn 5 -Crt+. Transposition of Tn 5 -Crt+ onto the broad host range plasmid pR 751 produced a broad host range carotenoid plasmid-pJP 115. Transfer of pJP 115 to the phylogenetically related nonphotosynthetic bacteria Paracoccus denitrificans, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Agrobacterium radiobacter, and Azotomonas insolita resulted in carotenoid biosynthesis by these strains. Expression of carotenoid photopigment genes in nonphotosynthetic bacteria lends credence to the evolutionary relationships between <b>photosynthetic</b> and non-photosynthetic <b>bacteria...</b>|$|R
