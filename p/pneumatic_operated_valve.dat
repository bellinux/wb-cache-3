5000|$|The RCV1000R {{lacks the}} {{seamless}} shift gearbox and the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>operated</b> <b>valves</b> of the RC213V. [...] It is less fuel-efficient, {{and will have}} a 23-litre fuel tank, less than the 24 litre maximum for the 2014 Open class but still significantly more than the 20 litre limit for the RC213V and the other 2014 bikes with “Factory” status.|$|R
5|$|A later {{development}} was the tubular-pneumatic action, which uses changes of pressure within lead tubing to <b>operate</b> <b>pneumatic</b> <b>valves</b> throughout the instrument. This allowed a lighter touch, and {{more flexibility in}} {{the location of the}} console, within a 50-foot (15-m) limit. This type of construction was used in the late 19th century to early 20th century, and has had only rare application since the 1920s.|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} design and {{implementation}} of software for control of manufacturing tests of pneumatic proportional valve Festo MPYE. The single-purpose testing device consists of a DAQ device, a pressure sensor and of electrically <b>operated</b> <b>pneumatic</b> <b>valves.</b> In the introduction of this thesis are outlined aims of thesis followed by introduction to single-purpose assemblies commonly used in practice. The main part of this thesis deals with analysis and with solving the issues of assigned product testing. The designed and implemented modular software for control of manufacturing tests of assigned product is presented as an outcome and this software is easily adjustable for tests of a different product. In the conclusion are assessed achieved aims...|$|R

50|$|Mechanically <b>operated</b> <b>valves</b> apply forces {{by using}} cams, wheels, rollers, etc., hence these valves are {{subjected}} to wear.|$|R
30|$|Operational (O): checks {{how much}} of the pipes can be reached in order to <b>operate</b> <b>valves</b> or check surfaces.|$|R
50|$|Manually <b>operated</b> <b>valves</b> {{work with}} simple levers or paddles where the {{operator}} applies force to <b>operate</b> the <b>valve.</b> Spring force is sometimes used {{to recover the}} position of valve. Some manual valves utilize either a lever or an external pneumatic or hydraulic signal to return the spool.|$|R
50|$|Steering was {{accomplished}} by four rudders in a cruciform configuration. These were moved by four pairs of <b>pneumatic</b> servos, <b>operated</b> by solenoid <b>valves.</b> An air bottle, pressurized to , supplied air for the servos and also supplied the air that spun the three, air-blown gyroscopes in the missile's inertial navigation system. A high pressure air supply from the aircraft was also required to spin the gyros before the missile was launched.|$|R

50|$|A {{solenoid valve}} is an electromechanically <b>operated</b> <b>valve.</b> The valve is {{controlled}} by an electric current through a solenoid: {{in the case of}} a two-port valve the flow is switched on or off; {{in the case of a}} three-port valve, the outflow is switched between the two outlet ports. Multiple solenoid valves can be placed together on a manifold.|$|R

50|$|Safety during pigging {{relies on}} the strict {{adherence}} to safety procedures, which give detailed description of a safe <b>valve</b> <b>operating</b> sequence. By physically blocking incorrect operations, valve interlocks enforce such sequences, rather than interfering with them. Valve interlocks are permanently mounted to manual and motor <b>operated</b> <b>valves</b> and the closure door. The interlocks block operation of a valve or door, unless the appropriate keys are inserted.|$|R
25|$|Diving {{regulators}} use mechanically <b>operated</b> <b>valves.</b> In {{most cases}} there is ambient pressure feedback to both {{first and second}} stage, except where this is avoided to allow constant mass flow through an orifice in a rebreather, which requires a constant upstream pressure.|$|R
50|$|Examples of {{isolation}} groups include the main steamlines, the reactor water cleanup system, the reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) system, shutdown cooling, and the residual heat removal system. For pipes which inject {{water into the}} containment, two safety-related check valves are generally used in lieu of motor <b>operated</b> <b>valves.</b> These valves must be tested regularly as well to ensure they do indeed seal and prevent leakage even against high reactor pressures.|$|R
50|$|An {{air-operated}} valve {{is a type}} {{of power}} <b>operated</b> <b>valve</b> that uses air pressure against a piston or diaphragm to produce linear or circular movement to operate a valve.Types are 2-way, 3-way and 4-way. The 2 way air-operated valves can be either normally closed or normally opened.|$|R
50|$|B16.44- Manually <b>Operated</b> Metallic Gas <b>Valves</b> for Use in Aboveground Piping Systems up to 5 psi. This Standard {{applies to}} new valve {{construction}} and covers quarter-turn manually <b>operated</b> metallic <b>valves</b> in sizes NPS 4¼ and tubing sizes 1¼ O.D. These valves {{are intended for}} indoor installation as gas shutoff valves when installed in above ground fuel gas piping downstream of the gas meter outlet and upstream of the inlet connection to a gas appliance. The valves covered by this Standard are limited to application temperatures between 32 F and 125 F at pressures not to exceed 5 psig. This Standard {{does not apply to}} manually <b>operated</b> gas <b>valves</b> which {{are an integral part of}} a gas appliance. Manually <b>operated</b> gas <b>valves</b> intended for application to a particular appliance are covered in the American National Standard for Manually <b>Operated</b> Gas <b>Valves</b> for Appliances, Appliance Connector Valves, and Hose End Valves, ANSI Z21.15/CGA 9.1.|$|R
50|$|Large {{two-stroke}} ship diesels {{are sometimes}} {{made to be}} reversible. Like four-stroke ship engines (some of which are also reversible) they use mechanically <b>operated</b> <b>valves,</b> so require additional camshaft mechanisms. These engine use crossheads to eliminate sidethrust on the piston and isolate the under-piston space from the crankcase.|$|R

5000|$|The sylphon {{was invented}} in the early 1900s by {{meteorologist}} Weston Fulton (1871 - 1946), who named it for the sylphs of Western mythology.

50|$|Low-frequency {{induction}} is {{a sometimes}} unwanted form of inductive coupling. For example, when metallic pipeline is installed parallel to a high-voltage power line, the pipeline, {{which is a}} conductor and is insulated from the earth by its protective coating, can develop voltages which are hazardous to personnel <b>operating</b> <b>valves</b> or otherwise contacting the pipeline.|$|R

40|$|The {{pressure}} wave generator {{is a critical}} component of a pulse tube refrigerator. Conventionally either a solenoid <b>operated</b> electromagnetic <b>valve</b> or a rotary valve driven by a hermetically sealed motor is used for this. In this article, we present a novel {{pressure wave}} generator design based on cam <b>operated</b> <b>valves</b> for use with pulse tube refrigerators. This, when coupled with an inverter drive (variable frequency drive), forms a versatile pressure wave generator in the range between 1 and 10 Hz. In a single stage double inlet pulse tube using this type of pressure wave generator, refrigeration power of about 6 W at 77 K and a no load temperature of about 42 K were obtained. The above results are comparable to those obtained with pulse tube systems based on other two types of pressure wave generators. While the rotary valve based pressure wave generator is prone to developing leaks at the rotating seal, the solenoid valve based system cannot be operated continuously due to coil failure. The cam <b>operated</b> <b>valve</b> based pressure wave generator overcomes the above shortfalls of rotary valve and solenoid valve type pressure generators and is well suited for continuous operation of the refrigerator...|$|R
