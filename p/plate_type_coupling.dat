40|$|This paper proposes an {{absorption}} {{refrigeration cycle}} device using a <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> generator {{in order to}} improve the start-up process to reduce the time to reach the steady state condition. A conventional absorption refrigeration cycle device using a shell&tube generator places a rectifier above the generator to remove absorbent from generated refrigerant vapor and to raise concentration of refrigerant vapor. However the replacement of a shell&tube type generator by a <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> generator makes it difficult to include the rectifier within an absorption refrigeration system. Therefore, the cycle proposed in the present study introduced a partial condenser instead of a rectifier. Refrigerant vapor in the partial condenser is cooled by coolant so that only absorbent within the generated vapor condenses by utilizing the difference of boiling temperature. Then, the analytical model was formulated in order to investigate the effectiveness of the <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> generator. The analytical results show that the start-up time is reduced with the <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> generator...|$|R

AramouniDetermining {{the optimum}} cooking {{instructions}} for microwavable not-ready-to-eat foods {{requires an understanding}} of the factors that affect heating of foods in microwaves. Factors are often studied without consideration of interactions. Consumer-driven factors appear to be the least-studied. Microwave appliance, heat time, flip step, and plate material were studied to determine their effect on final temperature of a frozen hand-held calzone sandwich after heating. Initial studies to ensure wattage stability during testing and a study to narrow down the plates to be tested were also executed. In the central experiment, a calzone was heated on a microwavable plate for one minute, then flipped or not flipped and heated again for the remaining time in each of four microwave ovens. The microwave ovens differed in age and manufacturer, but were of similar stated wattage. Probes were attached to a data logger and temperatures were recorded every 5 seconds for 2 minutes post-heating to attain the average maximum temperature and lowest maximum temperature for each run. The data was evaluated by analysis of variance and significant differences were compared using Tukey means. All factors had significant effects on average maximum temperature and lowest maximum temperature {{with the exception of the}} flip step (p<. 05). <b>Plate</b> <b>type</b> was the most critical factor. Calzones heated on paper plates were significantly hotter than those on stoneware plates (p<. 05). Significant differences were also observed among microwaves and heat times (p<. 05). An interaction between microwave and <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> indicated the effect of <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> was not consistent across all microwaves (p<. 05). Although flip step, as tested, was not a significant factor, a follow-up experiment to de-couple the effect of the physical flipping of the calzone and the stopping of the microwave during the heating process indicated that the stopping of the microwave was more critical to heating than the actual flip step. A follow-up study of <b>plate</b> <b>type,</b> microwave and heat time in higher-wattage microwaves showed that microwave appliance and heat time again had significant effects on temperature (p<. 05), however; <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> was not a significant factor in the higher-wattage microwaves. The effect of <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> was dependent on the exact microwave used. Various <b>plate</b> <b>types</b> and multiple microwaves in each wattage range should be used for development of microwavable frozen calzones because wattage alone cannot predict performance and because of the interaction between microwave and <b>plate</b> <b>type...</b>|$|R

40|$|Plutonic {{rocks in}} the S∅r Rondane Mountains, East Antarctica {{comprise}} early Paleozoic granitic rocks and late Proterozoic tonalite. The former is further classified into two types (volcanic arc <b>type</b> and within <b>plate</b> <b>type).</b> The initial εNd values for the analyzed granitic rocks (six samples from volcanic arc type and one from within <b>plate</b> <b>type)</b> fall in a limited range (- 1. 48 to + 0. 62) and Nd model ages (T_) for the granitic rocks were estimated to be 900 - 1000 Ma which agree well with the ages of basement rocks. Taking Sr isotope data and element compositions into account, volcanic arc type granites (Dufek, Lunckeryggen and Mefjell) are explained by a fractional crystallization from an isotopically homogeneous magma which was generated from late Proterozoic lower (to middle) crustal rocks, whereas the within <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> granites (Vikingh∅gda, Rogerstoppane and Pingvinane) are assumed to have been formed mainly by mixing between crustal rocks with high Sr isotope ratios and mafic (to intermediate) parental magma originated in the upper mantle or lower crustal source. The presence of extremely high Sr isotope ratios for the within <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> granites suggests the involvement of more older crustal rocks (early to middle Proterozoic) beneath the S∅r Rondane Mountains. Changes of magma sources and a dominant process of magma formation from within <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> granites (early) to volcanic arc type granites (late) reflect the change of tectonic situation in this region during the early Paleozoic.

These investigations include design of <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> heat exchanger, heat transfer enhancement, flow phenomenon and cleanliness factor. In process plants, this type of heat exchange is generally used for recovering heat content of exhaust steam. However, with the flow of fluid for a long period, fouling occurs on the plate surface.

An extensive experimental investigation has been carried out under clean and dirty condition of the said <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> heat exchanger.

In order to study this, different four types of flow control valves (ITV, SCV, IMV and MPROP) were installed on the wobble plate fuel pump, and fuel flow rate, torque, and temperature variation of pump were investigated under various operating conditions by using pump performance test system. It was revealed that wobble <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> fuel pump worked well with ITV and SCV control valve, and the flow rate and torque of fuel pump was in proportion to the value of valve open duty.

(AIAA J. Vol. 51, 2013, pp. 2665 - 2677). The use of porous metal foams to fill the interstices between adjacent members of the sawtooth can almost completely suppress the vortex shedding tonal noise, whilst the serration effect on the broadband noise reduction is retained. This concept will promote the nonflat <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> serrated trailing edge to become a genuine alternative to the conventional flat <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> serrated trailing edge, which is known to have drawbacks in the structural stability, aerodynamic performances and implementation issues. For the plasma actuators, configuration which produces electric wind in a tangential direction is found to be not very effective in suppressing the vortices emanated from the serration blunt root. On the other hand, for the plasma configuration which produces electric wind in a vertical direction, good level of vortex shedding tonal noise reduction has been demonstrated. However, the self noise produced by the plasma actuators negates the noise benefits on the tonal nois...|$|R
