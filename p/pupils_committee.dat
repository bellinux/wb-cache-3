50|$|On 27 June 1947, {{the former}} <b>pupils</b> <b>committee</b> of Dalziel {{decided that the}} school's {{memorial}} of the pupils who died during both wars should {{take the form of}} playing fields. The former Cleland Estate was put up for sale by the Right Honourable Sir John Colville, P.C., G.C.I.E, for only six thousand pounds. For the purchase to be possible, there was lots of fundraising along with a grant provided by the Lanarkshire Education Committee. After the purchase, playing fields in the form of hockey, rugby and football were laid, and later an athletics track would also be included. In 1990, the War Memorial Trust took up the challenge of maintaining the facility, converting the former Cleland Estate into what is {{known as one of the}} finest facilities in Scotland, Dalziel Park.|$|E
50|$|The Pupils Committees of the European Schools are federated via CoSup, {{an acronym}} formed from its French title, Conseil Supérieur des Elèves. Each <b>Pupils</b> <b>Committee</b> elects two representatives {{to send to}} {{meetings}} of CoSup. Accredited European Schools may also send representatives. As of 2006, CoSup is recognised by the Board of Governors of the European Schools as an official body. It is able to represent common student interests on the European Schools Joint Teaching Committee. CoSup possesses a common fund, able to financially support represented Pupils Committees, when necessary. Amongst other duties, CoSup is responsible for organising the annual Europarty, held in a different European city each year, and open to any student of the European Schools {{over the age of}} 16 to attend. CoSup meets four times per academic year and utilises a Qualified Majority Voting system, endowing each European School represented a number of votes proportional to its share of the total amount of students enrolled across all European Schools. Each School receives an equal vote weighting for matters concerning the functioning of CoSup, such as its presidential elections, which occur at the last meeting of each academic year.|$|E
50|$|Secondary level {{students}} {{are represented in}} matters of school governance by the Pupils' Committee (PC). Consisting of at least 20 members, including a president, and elected democratically in school-wide elections {{at the start of}} each academic year, it operates as an independent non-profit organisation recognised by the school community, the Luxembourg government and the different official bodies of the European Schools. The Pupils' Committees of the two Luxembourg based European Schools retain close ties. Scrutiny of decisions affecting all 14 European Schools made by the Board of Governors is made possible by CoSup (Conseil Superior des Eleves), which federates the 14 schools' <b>Pupil's</b> <b>Committees.</b>|$|R

Their failure {{to have children}} was seen to reflect badly on Nokutela and John fathered a child with one of their <b>pupils.</b> A <b>committee</b> {{was set up to}} investigate John, but they took no action and Nokutela felt humiliated. The couple separated in about 1914, and Nokutela moved to the Transvaal until she became ill with kidney disease. She returned to live with John Dube in Johannesburg, and died in 1917 at the age of 44. Her funeral was attended by Pixley ka Isaka Seme and other prominent members of what was to become the African National Congress.|$|R
50|$|The roll {{increased}} {{rapidly and}} reached bursting point in 1960 when it stood at 200 {{and the school}} had to turn away <b>pupils.</b> The Education <b>Committee</b> {{announced that it would}} institute a building programme and double the school's size. The Committee also accepted the Governor’s recommendation that to preserve the essential characteristic of the school, the size of the Boarding House be increased to 90.

40|$|Ceylon {{has seen}} very rapid {{changes in the}} {{educational}} field particularly {{in the past ten}} years, consequent on the acceptance of the Report of the Special Committee on Education, 194, by the State Council in the following year. This Committee recommended, among other things, a scheme of free education from the kindergarten to the University, and a scheme of post-primary education, the selection of pupils for which was to be made on the results of a general intelligence test, and attainment tests in language and arithmetic, both of which were to be administered in the mother tongue of the <b>pupils.</b> This <b>Committee</b> also stressed that one of the major defects in the system of education in Ceylon was its excessive uniformity, in that it was purely academic, and recommended that post-primary education should be differentiated according to the abilities and aptitudes of pupils. Ten years have passed since these major recommendations were accepted and given statutory significance, but no tests have yet been constructed and standardized for the selection of pupils for secondary education according to their abilities and aptitudes. The writer, therefore, interested in educational research, has attempted to carry out the above survey on an island-wide scale; incidentally, it is {{the first of its kind}} in the history of education in Ceylon. Making use of his non-verbal intelligence group test constructed and validated for Ceylonese children in 1950, and of attainment tests in language and arithmetic, and a practical ability test, all of which were specifically constructed and validated for this survey, the writer has administered these tests to a random representative sample of over 7000 Ceylonese boys and girls in the above age-group, in their mother tongue. An account of this investigation and the results of this survey are reported in this thesis. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recently, we {{developed}} an evidence-based guideline targeting volunteers assisting teachers {{in carrying out}} didactical activities with vulnerable <b>pupils.</b> The guideline <b>committee</b> included {{a variety of different}} stakeholders to discuss the evidence of effectiveness of these activities, retrieved through systematic literature searches. Objective: We learned from previous guideline procedures that discussions between panel members take time. We therefore developed predefined flow charts, shaped as decision trees, that could be used by the chair to streamline the discussion and keep the focus on the topic of interest. Methods: We developed decision trees based on the following questions: Is there evidence? Is it clear and positive? Is the activity conducted by the right people? If it is not, can we extrapolate the study findings? Is the activity feasible in the given context? Is it important for the target group? Are there any limitations we need to consider? Based on the answers to these questions, an activity was either recommended, suggested or not recommended. Results: The guideline committee developed all recommendations in one session, lasting four hours, including an introduction to the project and the methodology. The decision trees stimulated the conversation and provided a focus for discussion. Discussion: The template is ready for adoption and testing by other chairs of guideline committees, in terms of their further refinement. Implication for guideline developers: After the successful use of the decision trees in one project, the utility of these decision trees seems helpful but needs to be further evaluated in practice. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|The Education Act and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child {{states that}} {{children}} and young people are entitled to participation in school. Pupils' opinions about teaching and the social environment should be heard and considered in decision-making. Reasons for child participation in school can be related to development of citizenship and democracy, to participation as a right, and as a way of empowerment and enhancement of self esteem amongst children. Since 2005, all schools are required to have a school environment committee with representatives from the school management, teachers, parents, pupils and the municipality. The purpose of the school environment committee is to ensure that pupils have influence on the learning environment, and to involve pupils in efforts to improve it (The Directorate for Education and Training, 2011). This is a very formal and bureaucratic arena for participation. In my thesis I examine how pupils in lower secondary schools perceive their participation in formal committees in school. I am interested in their views on reasons for pupil representation, and how they perceive the level of influence and their own role in meetings and decision-making processes. The study is based on interviews with eight pupils from three schools in Bergen. I use qualitative methods and an interpretative framework. I conducted group interviews, transcribed and processed the interviews through meaning condensation. My findings are then analysed on three levels, using a model by Kvale & Brinkmann (2009). I place my findings in a broader context using democracy theory and right based models for participation. The models provide useful perspectives and criteria for levels of democracy and quality of participation processes with {{children and young}} people. Reasons for participation in school are complex and partly unclear. My findings indicate that elections and representation in committees fulfil minimum levels of democracy. The situation regarding pupils' influence on the scope and case management processes in school is more critical. Lack of training, information, time to case preparation and discussions in class are challenges pupils face. The degree of involvement and the quality of participation processes depends strongly on teachers and school management. Each school and committee must themselves define limits and content of pupils' participation in school, based on the legal framework. My informants claim influence, power and participation through their role as representatives. Personal development and increased self confidence are additional benefits, even if the formal context makes them shy at first. Pupils regard their participation as important since they are the centre of schools activities, and should therefore be heard and consulted in matters concerning them. Pupils have knowledge and insights about school, and it is crucial for them to have influence on their everyday life. My informants regard their participation {{as a part of a}} joint cooperation for a better school. Participation as democracy training is not mentioned by any of my informants. Pupils feel that they are included and respected during committee meetings; the formal structures ensure that everyone has their say. <b>Pupil</b> representation in <b>committees</b> may not meet minimum levels of democracy and quality standards of participation, but the way adults meet and respond to pupils is crucial for their perception of participation and involvement. The responsiveness of adults can compensate for lack of democratic rights and thorough participation processes in schools...|$|R
