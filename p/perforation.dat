5|$|Of 4,460 {{claims in}} the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Closed Claims Project database, 266 (approximately 6%) were for airway injury. Of these 266 cases, 87% of the {{injuries}} were temporary, 5% were permanent or disabling, and 8% resulted in death. Difficult intubation, age older than 60 years, and female gender were associated with claims for <b>perforation</b> of the esophagus or pharynx. Early signs of <b>perforation</b> were present in only 51% of <b>perforation</b> claims, whereas late sequelae occurred in 65%.|$|E
5|$|Accompanying {{injuries}} often play a {{key role}} in the outcome. Injuries that may accompany TBI include pulmonary contusion and laceration; and fractures of the sternum, ribs and clavicles. Spinal cord injury, facial trauma, traumatic aortic rupture, injuries to the abdomen, lung, and head are present in 40–100%. The most common accompanying injury is esophageal <b>perforation</b> or rupture (known as Boerhaave syndrome), which occurs in as many as 43% of the penetrating injuries to the neck that cause tracheal injury.|$|E
5|$|More serious {{complications}} include laryngospasm, <b>perforation</b> of the trachea or esophagus, pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents {{or other}} foreign bodies, fracture or dislocation of the cervical spine, temporomandibular joint or arytenoid cartilages, decreased oxygen content, elevated arterial carbon dioxide, and vocal cord weakness. In {{addition to these}} complications, tracheal intubation via the nasal route carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and potentially severe nasal bleeding. Newer technologies such as flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy have fared better in reducing the incidence {{of some of these}} complications, though the most frequent cause of intubation trauma remains a lack of skill {{on the part of the}} laryngoscopist.|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundLimited {{data are}} {{available}} on the management of esophageal <b>perforations</b> in elderly patients. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the characteristics and treatments of esophageal <b>perforations</b> in elderly patients. MethodsData on patients with esophageal <b>perforations</b> and older than 65  years of age were retrospectively reviewed from January 2001 to November 2012. Surgery-related and caustic-induced <b>perforations</b> were excluded in this study. Disease-related parameters, such as sex, bacteriology, locations, time to treatment, treatment types, and outcomes, were analyzed. A new method, cervical esophageal ligation and T-tube diversion following repair of esophageal <b>perforations,</b> was introduced. ResultsA total of 61 patients, 24 females and 37 males, were eligible for this study. Heterogeneous presentations were noted following diagnosis of esophageal <b>perforations.</b> Esophagoscopy was the most frequently used method for diagnosis of esophageal <b>perforations.</b> Different sites of <b>perforations</b> would induce heterogeneous complications, among which thoracic <b>perforations</b> were most lethal. In this study, disease-related mortality rate was 13. 1 % (8 patients). Thoracic and abdominal <b>perforations</b> (p    48  hours (p =  0. 002) were two significant factors responsible for mortality of patients esophageal <b>perforations.</b> The suggested new diversion method can be used as a salvage treatment option for complicated <b>perforations.</b> ConclusionEarly diagnosis and prompt treatments are the important determinants to reduce mortalities of elderly patients with esophageal <b>perforations.</b> Cervical esophageal ligation combined with T-tube diversion can be considered as a salvage method for complicated <b>perforations...</b>|$|R

The lateral and central <b>perforations</b> occur in essentially equal numbers while the posterior <b>perforations</b> are uncommon (less than 10 %). Lateral <b>perforations</b> occur primarily in edentulous individuals and are equally distributed between males and females. Central <b>perforations</b> occur most often in dentulous females.

5|$|Most E. coli strains do {{not cause}} disease, but virulent strains can cause gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, {{neonatal}} meningitis, hemorrhagic colitis, and Crohn's disease. Common {{signs and symptoms}} include severe abdominal cramps, diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, vomiting, and sometimes fever. In rarer cases, virulent strains are also responsible for bowel necrosis (tissue death) and <b>perforation</b> without progressing to hemolytic-uremic syndrome, peritonitis, mastitis, septicemia, and Gram-negative pneumonia. Very young children {{are more susceptible to}} develop severe illness, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome, however, healthy individuals of all ages are at risk to the severe consequences that may arise as a result of being infected with E. coli.|$|E
5|$|Several {{natural causes}} (diseases) have been suggested, {{including}} malaria and typhoid fever. A 1998 {{article in the}} New England Journal of Medicine attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by bowel <b>perforation</b> and ascending paralysis. Another recent analysis suggested pyogenic (infectious) spondylitis or meningitis. Other illnesses fit the symptoms, including acute pancreatitis and West Nile virus. Natural-cause theories also tend to emphasize that Alexander's health {{may have been in}} general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds. The anguish that Alexander felt after Hephaestion's death may also have contributed to his declining health.|$|E
5|$|The few {{contraindications}} {{to surgery}} include inoperable tumor, massive obesity, a particularly high-risk operation, or {{a desire to}} preserve fertility. These contraindications happen in about 5–10% of cases. Women who wish to preserve their fertility and have low-grade stage I cancer can be treated with progestins, with or without concurrent tamoxifen therapy. This therapy can be continued until the cancer does not respond to treatment or until childbearing is done. Uterine <b>perforation</b> may occur during a D or an endometrial biopsy. Side effects of surgery to remove endometrial cancer can specifically include sexual dysfunction, temporary incontinence, and lymphedema, along with more common side effects of any surgery, including constipation.|$|E

5|$|While copper IUDs may {{increase}} menstrual bleeding {{and result in}} more painful cramps hormonal IUDs may reduce menstrual bleeding or stop menstruation altogether. Cramping can be treated with NSAIDs. Other potential complications include expulsion (2–5%) and rarely <b>perforation</b> of the uterus (less than 0.7%). A previous model of the intrauterine device (the Dalkon shield) was {{associated with an increased}} risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, however the risk is not affected with current models in those without sexually transmitted infections around the time of insertion.|$|E
5|$|Complications {{may also}} be severe and {{long-lasting}} or permanent, such as vocal cord damage, esophageal <b>perforation</b> and retropharyngeal abscess, bronchial intubation, or nerve injury. They may even be immediately life-threatening, such as laryngospasm and negative pressure pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), aspiration, unrecognized esophageal intubation, or accidental disconnection or dislodgement of the tracheal tube. Potentially fatal complications more often associated with prolonged intubation and/or tracheotomy include abnormal communication between the trachea and nearby structures such as the innominate artery (tracheoinnominate fistula) or esophagus (tracheoesophageal fistula). Other significant complications include airway obstruction due to loss of tracheal rigidity, ventilator-associated pneumonia and narrowing of the glottis or trachea. The cuff pressure is monitored carefully {{in order to avoid}} complications from over-inflation, many of which can be traced to excessive cuff pressure restricting the blood supply to the tracheal mucosa. A 2000 Spanish study of bedside percutaneous tracheotomy reported overall complication rates of 10–15% and procedural mortality of 0%, which is comparable to those of other series reported in the literature from the Netherlands and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Mancera {{has been}} married twice. His first {{marriage}} was to a woman named Martha in the early 1990s, with whom lived in civil union for a year. They divorced two years later, and after six years Mancera married Magnolia, {{with whom he had}} two children, Miguel and Leonardo. After a decade, he divorced Magnolia. Mancera has a daughter out of wedlock, but he has said the child's mother does not want Mancera to see her. In September 2007, two assailants on a motorcycle intercepted and attempted to rob him while he drove his BMW in Periférico Sur. His bodyguard intervened and shot one of the robbers, killing him. From 2008 to 2009, Mancera dated Alejandra Barrales, who was the president of the PRD party at that time, and also she intended to become the PRD candidate for Mayor of Mexico City in 2012. In his spare time, he practices multiple sports, including Krav Maga, indoor cycling and weight lifting, hunting and aviation. On October 31, 2014, Mancera had a cardiac surgery because three months before a cardiac arrhythmia was detected.

25|$|<b>Perforation</b> (a hole in {{the wall}} of the {{gastrointestinal}} tract) often leads to catastrophic consequences if left untreated. Erosion of the gastro-intestinal wall by the ulcer leads to spillage of the stomach or intestinal content into the abdominal cavity. <b>Perforation</b> at the anterior surface of the stomach leads to acute peritonitis, initially chemical and later bacterial peritonitis. The first sign is often sudden intense abdominal pain; an example is Valentino's syndrome, named after the silent-film actor who experienced this pain before his death.

5000|$|As {{the name}} for a philatelic tool used to measure <b>perforations.</b> Invented in 1866 by Jacques Legrand, the typical [...] "perf gauge" [...] (sometimes called an odontometer) is a metal or plastic tile on which <b>perforations</b> of gauges ranging from 7 and 7½ to 16 and 16½ are pictured (the {{pictures}} sometimes appear {{at the edges of}} the tile). The philatelist places each of these depictions beside a stamp until one is found that exactly matches the stamp’s <b>perforations.</b> Such a gauge is an indispensable tool for identifying stamps that present identical images but have been issued with <b>perforations</b> of several different sizes. An extreme example is the U. S. Washington-Franklin Issues, some of which are found with <b>perforations</b> of gauges 8½, 10, 11, 12, and 12½.|$|R

40|$|The {{benefits}} of using pin fin heat sinks with multiple <b>perforations</b> are investigated using complementary experimental and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods. An experimental heat sink with multiple <b>perforations</b> is designed and fabricated and parameter {{studies of the}} effect of perforated pin fin design on heat transfer and pressure drops across the heat sinks undertaken. Experimental data is found to agree well with predictions from a CFD model for the conjugate heat transfer into the cooling air stream. The validated CFD model is used to carry out a parametric study of the influence of the number and positioning of circular <b>perforations,</b> which shows that the Nusselt number increases monotonically with the number of pin <b>perforations,</b> while the pressure drop and fan power required to overcome the pressure drop all reduce monotonically. Pins with five <b>perforations</b> are shown to have a 11 % larger Nu than for corresponding solid pin cases. These benefits arise due to not only the increased surface area but also heat transfer enhancement near <b>perforations</b> through the formation of localised air jets. In contrast, the locations of the pin <b>perforations</b> are much less influential. When examined in the context of CPU cooling, a conjugate heat transfer analysis shows that improved heat transfer with pin <b>perforations</b> translates into significantly reduced processor case temperatures with the additional benefit of a reduction in the weight of the heat sink’s pins. To achieve these benefits care must be taken to ensure that pin <b>perforations</b> are aligned with the dominant flow direction and manufactured with a good quality surface finish...|$|R
