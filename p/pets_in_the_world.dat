50|$|Rat snakes (or ratsnakes) {{are members}} - along with kingsnakes, milk snakes, vine snakes and indigo snakes - of the {{subfamily}} Colubrinae {{of the family}} Colubridae. They are medium to large constrictors and are found {{throughout much of the}} Northern Hemisphere. They feed primarily on rodents and birds. With some species exceeding 3 m (10 ft) in total length, they can occupy top levels of some food chains. Many species make attractive and docile pets and one, the corn snake, {{is one of the most}} popular reptile <b>pets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Other species can be very skittish and sometimes aggressive, but bites are rarely serious. Like nearly all colubrids, rat snakes pose no threat to humans. Rat snakes were long thought to be completely nonvenomous, but recent studies have shown that some Old World species do possess small amounts of venom, though the amount is negligible relative to humans.|$|E

The results obtained corroborate previous studies suggesting that these species are not reciprocally monophyletic, due to either an ancient hybridization in central Brazil, or, they maybe just are morpho-varieties of the same species. Alternatively, if A. aestiva and A. ochrocephala were considered as sister species, the data could be interpreted either as a result of secondary contact or incipient speciation. Beyond the use of mtDNA for species identification, the high mtDNA haplotype diversity observed in A. aestiva indicates its potential use in discrimination of lineages that could be an important auxiliary tool to certify the captive origin of legally commercialized parrots.

The reason why I chose this subject is the high energy radiation associated with PET-CT requiring special measures to ensure staff protection.

40|$|Nuclear {{medicine}} {{is based on}} the radiotracer principle of George de Hevesy and the magic bullet concept by Ehrlich and focuses on the diagnosis, the treatment of diseases and the investigation of normal states within the human body using radiopharmaceuticals. A radiopharmaceutical is an atom or a chemical compound in which one or several atoms are replaced with a radionuclide. Several diagnostic and therapeutic radionuclides like 111 In, 99 mTc and 131 I originate from nuclear reactors via a generator or direct production. But to produce many of the conventional PET radionuclides like 11 C, 18 F, 13 N, 15 O a particle accelerator like a cyclotron is necessary. Today there is a rapid increase of the research based on intact monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), engineered mAb fragments and nontraditional antibody-like scaffolds. Approved mAbs and their engineered molecules are now entering the pre-clinical and clinical platforms and both areas have opened up a need for new un-conventional radionuclides with suitable physical and chemical properties that can match all the required half-lives and decay properties set by the different molecules. With the growing interest for imaging and therapeutic nuclear medicine the demand for more and different cyclotron produced radionuclides has increased. This is verified by the increased number of cyclotrons operating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> <b>In</b> 2005, ~ 350 cyclotrons were estimated to be operating in those countries monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency. A later investigation in 2014 concluded that there are currently more than 950 <b>PET</b> cyclotrons operating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> To access a broad variation of radionuclides the accelerator itself should be equipped with different target systems. The overall objective with <b>the</b> work described <b>in</b> this thesis was to increase and extend the medical radionuclide production with special focus <b>in</b> <b>the</b> design of water and solid targets for a MC 17 Scanditronix PET cyclotron.
