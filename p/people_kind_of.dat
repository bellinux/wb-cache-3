I've written four songs since the last tour ended but they're for this movie I'm working on. It has been nice though as I like to clear out the old palette and do other things. Helmet put two albums out in 18 months, Size Matters and Monochrome, so I think the next album has got to wait. I'm planning to sit down and write a couple songs in March but that is assuming I can get on a roll before we head out to Australia. But we probably won't get an album out {{until the end of the}} year." [...] In that interview, Hamilton was hoping that he could [...] "do two more albums and that there is also interest on the touring front. But as long as we can go play shows and people come out to them and I feel good about what we're doing, then we'll do it. Realistically, I'm thinking of two more albums after Monochrome as in two years I'll be fifty years old. So I'm thinking will I be capable? It is very physically demanding and <b>people</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> under estimate the energy you have to put out to play this music. And I don't go out to do a half-assed job.

[...] In an interview with Billboard, Bedingfield said: [...] "I've titled the album Strip Me because its about stripping down {{who we are as}} humans. We're united about our needs, our desires and our pain, all the different things we go through together. Strip Me felt like it explains what the songs are about more than any other title I could think of. So it has a double meaning, but I think <b>people</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> know me enough to know what I mean by it. [...] The thirteen-track standard edition, the twenty-one track deluxe edition and pre-order bonus track editions of the album were compiled from more than 50 songs which Bedingfield had written since touring. In an interview with PopEater she said [...] "I've been touring for so many years now that I wrote with my live gigs in mind. I wanted to write anthems that people could sing along to - things that were still personal, but definitely trying to find the best way to connect with people." [...] On the album she worked with Andreas Kleerup, John Hill, Wyclef Jean, Salaam Remi, Ryan Tedder, Jonas Myrin, Eg White and Sia Furler. None of the songs worked on with Jean, Remi or Furler made the final track listing, although all of the songs on the final track list were co-written by Bedingfield. Additionally Idolator revealed that Bedingfield had recorded a Ne-Yo-assisted duet titled [...] "The Little Things", which was produced by StarGate, though it was not included on the final pressing either. Bedingfield told fans in December 2010, via a recorded video message, that the album could be released elsewhere in the world later on but for the near present she was focusing on America.|$|E

The unique strength of radio is a horizontal… That’s where people change their mind or modify their opinions perhaps or see other points of view.”“Because radio is so flexible and personal, it will be here, {{as long as we}} continue to make it essential … Our raw materials are ideas, culture, community, news and interesting people.”“the only definition of ‘broadcast’ in 1901 years before the start of broadcast radio was ‘to sow seeds.’ This is still my favorite metaphor for public radio.”“In one of the histories that’s been written about NPR, they said that my colleagues on the executive level had 'disdain' for me when they saw who I had been hiring, because I thought that anyone could learn radio because I had worked in the ghetto and with students. And it’s true, anyone can learn radio. The mechanics of it are quite simple. But what you can’t teach as easily, certainly, is curiosity, and empathy, and being a good listener, which is the key to good interviewing of course.”“…I think whatever talent I have is mainly just hiring good people, trying to see their gifts, and managing as I would like to be managed, which means being left alone as much as possible and, you know, have a clear job description, know what I’m supposed to do, be left alone to do it and bring as much as I can to it.”“When I asked a manager of a station in Rwanda, what he considers success, he said, ‘when a farmer calls us from the field and asks how he can turn cassava leaves into organic fertilizer or what pesticides to use. That is success because we’ve helped him and his life.’ It is that practical stuff.” ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{reviewing}} the shows 20th anniversary feature-length episode, Lydia Jenkin pointed {{out how it}} had become traditional to introduce a new character during the annual 90 minute episodes and pondered which female character would fall victim to Josh's good looks and charm. One of the shows writers, Rebecca Barry Hill, listed the Shortland Street 20th anniversary {{as one of the}} highlights of New Zealand television in 2012 and specifically noted Josh's introduction. Paul Casserly of The New Zealand Herald believed that by casting unlikeable characters on TV shows, producers were in effect pulling in viewers who consumed the product simply to hate the character. He noted Josh as an example of this on Shortland Street and referenced a friend who believed Josh was the, [...] "worst character, worst actor". Tempest noticed a significant difference in attitude towards Josh as his hero syndrome developed, [...] "When my character was a bit of a good guy, there were a lot more people stopping me on the street going, 'Hey, how's it going?'

[...] Josh and Roimata's affair was named as one of the top moments of the 2013 season, alongside Josh's heroic adventure in the 90 minute episode and his bomb in the season finale. Broadcaster Jason Reeves described Josh's story lines throughout 2013 as [...] "spectacular", with Tempest specifically noting the antagonistic character development. Television blogger, Chris Philpot, believed that though Josh was written with [...] "generic dialogue", Tempest had done some [...] "decent work" [...] portraying him in the 2013 finale. In the Ferndale Talk Best of 2013 awards, Josh was voted by fans as the character, [...] "you most want to leave", [...] "Most Deluded Character" [...] and the character with, [...] "The most ridiculous story lines". The storyline that saw Josh rat out the hospital heist was named the best storyline of the year. The episode featuring Josh's death was viewed by 622,630 viewers, making it the most viewed television show in New Zealand that night.|$|E
40|$|This report {{highlights}} Australian students 2 ̆ 7 growing lack {{of appreciation}} of the relevance and role of the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines {{in their lives and}} their potential for rewarding career opportunities. Key findings: More than 40 per cent of students surveyed did not feel encouraged to do well in maths and science by their teachers at high school. “That was also another influence with me with maths and biology. I did biology in year twelve but with maths I 2 ̆ 7 ve always been very weak and with the teaching, I felt also that the teachers sort of focussed on the ones that did well and the ones that didn 2 ̆ 7 t, sort of, you know, and I felt like if I went down that road I would just fail instantly because I was not good at maths, and I 2 ̆ 7 m still not good at maths, but that 2 ̆ 7 s why I went down the arts road as well. ” 1 in 3 students were influenced by past teachers in their university choices “I did Methods in year 11 and I had the worst teacher in the world, and I knew that {{she was the only one}} teaching it for year 12, because year 11 we had two teachers, in year 12 there was only one teacher, and I had her the year before, and I didn 2 ̆ 7 t want to do that subject again [...] .

Like kind of wearing glasses [...] . They never dress well. ” Students sometimes feel STEM subjects do not align with other interests and abilities “Our school combatted it when they introduced electives from year 8 onwards. You have a set of domains where you have to cover like a few fields a few times within the three years before you hit year 10 and you can do a science element but, it can be a science /PE element, so those kids that often don 2 ̆ 7 t like major in traditional science, can change it like doing like PE science, science of food. They get to do it in ways that they find more appealing. ” Some students interviewed saw no positive value from pursuing STEM as a career “I think they should do career fairs and stuff earlier like we started doing them in years 11 and 12 and maybe in year 10 but by that time you 2 ̆ 7 ve already picked the subjects that you 2 ̆ 7 re doing for your VCE or TCE and you are kind of already set in that. If it was earlier you 2 ̆ 7 d have more time to think about it or like, er, factory or area based career days so if you have one on science, have one on your arts subjects and then <b>people</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> see 2 ̆ 7 so this is where this kind of thing can take me 2 ̆ 7. ” An inability to understand or work with the precise black-and-white nature of science, as opposed to less structured processes, turned some students away “Well that 2 ̆ 7 s the main reason I dropped science, I just didn 2 ̆ 7 t.
