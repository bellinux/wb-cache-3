2500|$|The {{story is}} set in fictional Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp, a remote US {{government}} training facility {{under the guise of}} a children's summer camp. The area was hit centuries ago by a meteor made of psitanium (a fictional element that can grant psychic powers or strengthen existing powers), creating a huge crater. The psitanium affected the local wildlife, giving them limited psychic powers, such as bears with the ability to attack with telekinetic claws and cougars with pyrokinesis. The Native Americans of the area called psitanium [...] "whispering rock", which they used to build arrowheads. When settlers began inhabiting the region, the <b>psychoactive</b> <b>properties</b> of the meteor slowly drove them insane.

40|$|Introduction: Dementia {{currently}} affects over 35 {{million people}} worldwide. The {{most common form}} of dementia is Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD). Currently, treatments for AD do not stop or reverse the progression of the disease and they are accompanied by side effects. Areas covered: The main features of AD pathology, treatment options currently available, the endocannabinoid system and its functionality in general and its role in AD pathology in detail will be outlined. A particular focus will be on the therapeutic potential of the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol. Expert opinion: Based on the complex pathology of AD, a preventative, multimodal drug approach targeting a combination of pathological AD symptoms appears ideal. Importantly, cannabinoids show anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and antioxidant properties and have immunosuppressive effects. Thus, the cannabinoid system should be a prime target for AD therapy. The cannabinoid receptor 2 appears to be a promising candidate but its role in AD has to be investigated cautiously. Furthermore, the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol is of particular interest as it lacks the <b>psychoactive</b> and cognition-impairing <b>properties</b> of other cannabinoids. In conclusion, future research should focus on the evaluation of the effects of manipulations to the endocannabinoid system in established animal models for AD, combined with early-phase studies in humans...|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD) is {{the most}} common {{neurodegenerative}} disorder, characterized by progressive loss of cognition. Over 35 million individuals currently have AD worldwide. Unfortunately, current therapies are limited to very modest symptomatic relief. The brains of AD patients are characterized by the deposition of amyloid-β and hyperphosphorylated forms of tau protein. AD brains also show neurodegeneration and high levels of oxidative stress and inflammation. The phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) possesses neuroprotective, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and reduces amyloid-β production and tau hyperphosphorylation in vitro. CBD has also been shown to be effective in vivo making the phytocannabinoid an interesting candidate for novel therapeutic interventions in AD, especially as it lacks <b>psychoactive</b> or cognition-impairing <b>properties.</b> CBD treatment would be in line with preventative, multimodal drug strategies targeting a combination of pathological symptoms, which might be ideal for AD therapy. Thus, this review will present a brief introduction to AD biology and current treatment options before outlining comprehensively CBD biology and pharmacology, followed by in-vitro and in-vivo evidence for the therapeutic potential of CBD. We will also discuss the role of the endocannabinioid system in AD before commenting on the potential future of CBD for AD therapy (including safety aspects) ...|$|R
40|$|Salvinorin-A is a {{component}} of Salvia divinorum, displaying <b>psychoactive</b> and hallucinogenic <b>properties</b> in humans. Recent literature suggests that this compound {{can act as a}} potent and selective opioid receptor agonist, having high affinity towards the K-opioid receptor subtype. The aim of our study was to investigate whether and to what extent this compound can alter the release of neurotransmitters from isolated nerve terminals (synaptosomes) prepared from mouse hippocampus (HC), striatum (STR) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). The experimental approach used, i. e. the up-down superfusion of a synaptosomal monolayer, is considered a method of choice to investigate presynaptic mechanisms of control of neurotransmitter release. We focused on the release of prelabelled [3 H]noradrenaline ([3 H]NA) and [3 H]serotonin ([3 H] 5 HT) from rat HC synaptosomes and of [3 H]dopamine ([3 H]DA) from PFC and STR synaptosomes. Salvinorin-A failed to affect the spontaneous release of all the three amines, but significantly modified the release of these neurotransmitters induced by transient (90 s) exposure to 12 mM K+. In particular, Salvinorin-A potentiated in a concentration-dependent manner the K+-evoked release of [3 H]NA, while it inhibited, always in a concentration-dependent way the release of [3 H] 5 HT and of [3 H]DA. Both facilitation and inhibiton of amine exocytosis was prevented by entrapping into synaptosomes the Pertussis toxin, suggesting the primary involvement in these effects of G-protein coupled receptors sensitive to this toxin. These results may be relevant to the comprehension of the molecular mechanisms involved in the central effects induced by this natural product...|$|R
2500|$|When {{cannabis}} {{is grown}} for its medicinal or <b>psychoactive</b> <b>properties,</b> male plants are routinely separated from females to prevent pollination, as non-pollinated female plants produce {{the most potent}} and prized flowering tops, known as sinsemilla (from the Spanish [...] "sin semilla", meaning [...] "without seed").

40|$|Objectives: The media {{coverage}} about absinthe, a bitter spirit containing wormwood (Ar-temisia absinthium L.), continues to repeat unsubstantiated myths and legends {{and the public}} is systematically misinformed. Especially, the theory about a significant thujone content in absinthe must be put into perspective as {{there are a number}} of different wormwood chemotypes with a large variance in thujone content (0 - 70. 6 % in essential oil). However, a relatively high thujone amount of 260 mg/l derived from out-of-date calculations is generally presented as “historical content ” in addition with reports about unsubstantiated <b>psychoactive</b> or aphrodisiac <b>properties.</b> With the end of absinthe’s prohibition and rising public interest in the product, the misinformation in scientific studies was transferred to the popular press. The 260 mg/l is presented as common knowledge, and it is given as fact that the thujone content in the mid-nineteenth century was sig-nificantly greater than it is today. Methods: The thujone concentrations in pre-ban absinthe were calculated using authentic 19 th century French recipes under regard of the composition of wormwood oil derived by a litera-ture review. Results: A typical Absinthe Suisse de Pontarlier was calculated to have contained 23 ± 21 mg/l of thujone. It was, therefore, proven that the previous calculations overestimated the thujone content. Discussion: The following point about the thujone content of pre-ban absinthe should be stressed: there are no analyses from the 19 th century because neither knowledge about thujone nor the required analytical methodologies were in existence. Therefore, so-called “historical thujone contents ” are either speculative or derived from calculations using historic recipe books, experi-mental production of absinthes using such recipes, or analyses of vintage absinthes. The most conclusive evidence is provided by a number of studies about the experimental production of absinthes, and the analyses of vintage absinthes, which consistently showed that they contained only relatively low concentrations of thujone (< 10 mg/l). 1...|$|R
40|$|Definition: Although other abused {{drugs can}} be inhaled, the term inhalants is {{reserved}} for {{the wide variety of}} substances—including solvents, aerosols, gases, and nitrites—that are rarely, if ever, taken via any other route of administration. (See below for a list of examples.) Many products readily found in the home or workplace—such as spray paints, markers, glues, and cleaning fluids—contain volatile substances that have <b>psychoactive</b> (mind-altering) <b>properties</b> when inhaled. People do not typically think of these products as drugs because they were never intended for that purpose. However, these products are sometimes abused in that way. They are especially (but not exclusively) abused by young children and adolescents, and are the only class of substance abused more by younger than by older teens. How Are Inhalants Abused? Abusers of inhalants breathe them in through the nose or mouth {{in a variety of ways}} (known as “huffing”). They may sniff or snort fumes from a container or dispenser (such as a glue bottle or a marking pen), spray aerosols (such as computer cleaning dusters) directly into their nose or mouth, or place a chemical-soaked rag in their mouth. Abusers may also inhale fumes from a balloon or a plastic or paper bag. Although the high produced by inhalants usually lasts just a few minutes, abusers often try to prolong it by continuing to inhale repeatedly over several hours. People tend to abuse different inhalant products at different ages. New users ages 12 – 15 most commonly abuse glue, shoe polish, spray paints, gasoline, and lighter fluid. New users ages 16 – 17 most commonly abuse nitrous oxide or “whippets. ” Adults most commonly abuse a class of inhalants known as nitrites (such as amyl nitrites or “poppers”). How Do Inhalants Affect the Brain? Most abused inhalants other than nitrites depress the central nervous system in a manner not unlike alcohol. The effects are similar—including slurred speech, lack of coordination, euphoria, and dizziness. Inhalant abusers may also experience light-headedness, hallucinations, and delu-sions. With repeated inhalations, many users feel less inhibited and less in control. Some may feel drowsy for several hours and experience a lingering headache. Unlike other types of inhalants, nitrites enhance sexual pleasure by dilating and relaxing blood vessels. Although it is not very common, addiction to inhalants can occur with repeated abuse What Are the Other Health Effects of Inhalants Chemicals found in different types of inhaled products may produce a vari-ety of other short-term effects, such as nausea or vomiting, as well as more serious long-term consequences. These may include liver and kidney damage, hearing loss, or bone marrow damage. Effects may also include loss of coordination and limb spasms due to damage to myelin—a protective sheathing around nerve fibers that helps nerves transmit messages in the brain and peripheral nervous system. Inhalants can also cause brain damage by cutting off oxygen flow to the brain. Inhalants can even be lethal. Sniffing highly concentrated amounts of the chemicals in solvents or aerosol sprays can directly cause heart failure within minutes. This syndrome, known as “sudden sniffing death,” can result from a single session of inhalant use by an otherwise healthy young person. High concentrations of inhal-ants may also cause death from suffocation, especially when inhaled from a paper or plastic bag or in a closed area. Even when using aerosols or volatile products for their legitimate purposes like painting or cleaning, it is wise to do so in a well-ventilated room or outdoors. Nitrites are a special class of inhalants that are abused to enhance sexual pleasure and performance. They can be associated with unsafe sexual practices that increase the risk of contracting and spreading infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. Products Abused as Inhalants Volatile solvents—liquids that vaporize at room temperature •	Industrial or household products, including paint thinners or removers, degreasers, dry-cleaning fluids, gasoline, and lighter fluid •	Art or office supply solvents, including correction fluids, felt-tip marker fluid, electronic contact cleaners, and glue Aerosols—sprays that contain propellants and solvents •	Household aerosol propellants in items such as spray paints, hair or deodorant sprays, fabric protector sprays, aerosol computer cleaning products, and vegetable oil sprays Gases—found in household or commercial products and used as medical anesthetics •	Household or commercial products, including butane lighters and propane tanks, whipped cream aerosols or dispensers (whippets), and refrigerant gases •	Medical anesthetics, such as ether, chloroform, halothane, and nitrous oxide (“laughing gas”) Nitrites—used primarily as sexual enhancers •	Organic nitrites are volatiles that include cyclohexyl, butyl, and amyl nitrites, commonly known as “poppers. ” Amyl nitrite is still used in certain diagnostic medical procedures. When marketed for illicit use, organic nitrites are often sold in small brown bottles labeled as “video head cleaner,” “room odorizer,” “leather cleaner,” or “liquid aroma. ...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{marijuana}} to treat various medical conditions—or “medical marijuana”—is a controversial topic {{and has been for}} some time. Some people have argued that marijuana’s reported beneficial effects on a variety of symptoms justify its legalization as a medicine for certain patients. Often the potential harm {{of marijuana}} use is not considered in these arguments, although risk is part of what the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) assesses when deciding whether to approve a medicine. Under US Federal law, only FDA-approved medications are legal to prescribe—and marijuana is not one of those. Still, more than a dozen States have approved its use to alleviate a variety of symptoms. What Does Marijuana Do to the Body? Many of marijuana’s effects (including its <b>psychoactive</b> or mind-altering <b>properties)</b> stem from an ingredient called delta- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which resembles a chemical that the body and brain make naturally (see figure). THC attaches to specialized proteins, called cannabinoid receptors (CBRs), to which the body’s natural chemicals (e. g., anandamide) normally bind. CBRs are part of a vast communication network known as the endocannabinoid system (ECS), which plays a role in normal brain development and function. They cluster in brain areas that influence pleasure, memory, thinking, concentration, movement, coordination, and sensory and time perception. When someone smokes marijuana, THC stimulates the CBRs artificially, disrupting function of the natural cannabinoids. An overstimulation of these receptors in key brain areas produces the marijuana "high" as well as its other effects on mental processes. Why Isn’t Marijuana an FDA-approved Medicine? In fact, THC is an FDA-approved medication. It was shown in carefully controlled clinical trials to have therapeutic benefit for relieving nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy and stimulating appetite in patients with wasting syndrome (severe weight loss) that often accompanies AIDS. However, the scientific evidence to date is not sufficient for the marijuana plant to gain FDA approval, {{and there are a number}} of reasons why: First, there have not been enough clinical trials showing that marijuana’s benefits outweigh its risks in patients with the symptoms it is meant to treat. The FDA requires carefully conducted studies in large numbers of patients (hundreds to thousands) to accurately assess the benefits and risks of a potential medication. Second, to be considered a legitimate medicine, a substance must have well-defined and measureable ingredients that are consistent from one unit (such as a pill or injection) to the next. This consistency allows doctors to determine the dose and frequency. Along with THC, the marijuana plant contains over 400 other chemical compounds, including other cannabinoids that may be biologically active and vary from plant to plant. This makes it difficult to consider its use as a medicine even though some of marijuana’s specific ingredients may offer benefits. Finally, marijuana has certain adverse health effects that also must be taken into account. Because it is usually smoked, marijuana can cause or worsen respiratory symptoms (e. g., bronchitis, chronic cough). It also impairs short-term memory and motor coordination; slows reaction time; alters mood, judgment, and decision-making; and in some people can cause severe anxiety (paranoia) or psychosis (loss of touch with reality). And marijuana is addictive—about 4. 5 million people in this country meet clinical criteria for marijuana abuse or dependence. What’s the difference between medical and “street” marijuana? There is no difference between “medical-grade” marijuana and “street” marijuana. The marijuana sold in dispensaries as medicine is the same quality and carries the same health risks as marijuana sold on the street...|$|R

40|$|The term “bath salts” {{refers to}} an {{emerging}} family of drugs containing one or more synthetic chemicals related to cathinone, an amphetamine-like stimulant found naturally in the Khat plant. Reports of severe intoxication and dangerous health effects associated with use of bath salts have made these drugs a serious and growing {{public health and safety}} issue. The synthetic cathinones in bath salts can produce euphoria and increased sociability and sex drive, but some users experience paranoia, agitation, and hallucinatory delirium; some even display psychotic and violent behavior, and deaths have been reported in several instances. In Name Only The synthetic cathinone products marketed as “bath salts” to evade detection by authorities {{should not be confused with}} products such as Epsom salts that are sold to improve the experience of bathing. The latter have no <b>psychoactive</b> (drug-like) <b>properties.</b> Bath salts typically take the form of a white or brown crystalline powder and are sold in small plastic or foil packages labeled “not for human consumption. ” Sometimes also marketed as “plant food”—or, more recently, as “jewelry cleaner” or “phone screen cleaner”—they are sold online and in drug paraphernalia stores under a variety of brand names, such as “Ivory Wave," "Bloom," "Cloud Nine," "Lunar Wave," "Vanilla Sky," "White Lightning," and “Scarface. ” How Are Bath Salts Abused? Bath salts are typically taken orally, inhaled, or injected, with the worst outcomes being associated with snorting or needle injection. How Do Bath Salts Affect the Brain? Common synthetic cathinones found in bath salts include 3, 4 -methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), mephedrone (“Drone,” “Meph,” or “Meow Meow”), and methylone, but there are many others. Much is still unknown about how these substances affect the human brain, and each one may have somewhat different properties. Chemically, they are similar to amphetamines (such as methamphetamine) as well as to MDMA (ecstasy). The energizing and often agitating effects reported in people who have taken bath salts are consistent with other drugs like amphetamines and cocaine that raise the level of the neurotransmitter dopamine in brain circuits regulating reward and movement. A surge in dopamine in these circuits causes feelings of euphoria and increased activity. A similar surge of the transmitter norepinephrine can raise heart rate and blood pressure. Bath salts have been marketed as cheap (and until recently, legal—see Box) substitutes for those stimulants. A recent study found that MDPV—the most common synthetic cathinone found in the blood and urine of patients admitted to emergency departments after bath salts ingestion—raises brain dopamine in the same manner as cocaine but is at least 10 times more potent. The hallucinatory effects often reported in users of bath salts are consistent with other drugs such as MDMA or LSD that raise levels of another neurotransmitter, serotonin. A recent analysis of the effects in rats of mephedrone and methylone showed that these drugs raised levels of serotonin in a manner similar to MDMA. An Evolving Threat When bath salts emerged at the end of the last decade, they rapidly gained popularity in the U. S. and Europe as “legal highs. ” In October 2011, the U. S. Drug Enforcement Administration placed three common synthetic cathinones under emergency ban pending further investigation, and in July 2012, President Obama signed legislation permanently making two of them—mephedrone and MDPV—illegal along with several other synthetic drugs often sold as marijuana substitutes (“Spice”). Although the new law also prohibits chemically similar “analogues” of the named drugs, manufacturers are expected to respond by creating new drugs different enough from the banned substances to evade legal restriction. After mephedrone was banned in the United Kingdom in 2010, for example, a chemical called naphyrone quickly replaced it, and is now being sold as “jewelry cleaner” under the brand name “Cosmic Blast. ” What Are the Other Health Effects of Bath Salts? Bath salts have been linked to an alarming surge in visits to emergency departments and poison control centers across the country. Common reactions reported for people who have needed medical attention after using bath salts include cardiac symptoms (such as racing heart, high blood pressure, and chest pains) and psychiatric symptoms including paranoia, hallucinations, and panic attacks. Patients with the syndrome known as “excited delirium” from taking bath salts also may have dehydration, breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue, and kidney failure. Intoxication from several synthetic cathinones including MDPV, mephedrone, methedrone, and butylone has proved fatal in several instances. Early indications are that synthetic cathinones have a high abuse and addiction potential. In a study of the rewarding and reinforcing effects of MDPV, rats showed self-administration patterns and escalation of drug intake nearly identical to methamphetamine. Bath salts users have reported that the drugs trigger intense cravings (or a compulsive urge to use the drug again) and that they are highly addictive. Frequent consumption may induce tolerance, dependence, and strong withdrawal symptoms when not taking the drug. The dangers of bath salts are compounded by the fact that these products may contain other, unknown ingredients that may have their own harmful effects. Also, drug users who believe they are purchasing other drugs such as ecstasy may be in danger of receiving synthetic cathinones instead. For example, mephedrone has been found commonly substituted for MDMA in pills sold as ecstasy in the Netherlands...|$|R
