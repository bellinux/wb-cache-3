40|$|With this {{semester}} project, {{we want to}} develop a robot {{that could be used}} for floor marking at an exhibition or fair. This has always been a operose task that could be simplified a lot. We will use a Leica Total Station, a long range tracking device, as main source of localisation together with a Pioneer P 3 -DX differential drive robot. The use of these highly accurate laser measurements impose some limits that are to be found and analysed. In the end, a state estimator will be built, fusing odometry information with laser information. These location estimates can then be used to control the robot and therefore the <b>positioning</b> <b>of</b> the <b>markings.</b> i i...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Within {{the past}} few years, lane {{detection}} technology has become of high interest {{in the field of}} intelligent vehicles; however, robustness is still an issue. The challenge is to extract the lane markings effectively from the complex urban environment. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on Random Finite Set Statistics for estimating the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> lane <b>markings.</b> We rely on Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filtering and apply this technique to lane marking extraction in urban environment. Our method is based on two phases: an image preprocessing phase to extract pixels that potentially represent lanes and a tracking phase to identify lane markings. Compared to other approaches, our method presents a recursive filtering algorithm which extracts lane markings in the presence of clutter and non-lane markings. The experimental results exhibit the high performance of the proposed approach under various scenarios. I...|$|R

25|$|In {{the sport}} of cricket, the crease is a certain area demarcated by white lines painted or chalked {{on the field of}} play, and {{pursuant}} to the rules of cricket they help determine legal play in different ways for the fielding and batting side. They define the area within which the batsmen and bowlers operate. The term crease may refer to any of the lines themselves, particularly the popping crease, or to the region that they demark. Law 7 of the Laws of Cricket governs the size and <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the crease <b>markings,</b> and defines the actual line as the back edge of the width of the marked line on the grass, i.e., the edge nearest to the wicket at that end.|$|R

50|$|Another pre-existing, but emerged {{later than}} the kamal, {{navigation}} instrument was the cross-staff. The first working version of a cross-staff was developed for astronomical study in the 14th century and was later converted by Named due to its construction, the cross-staff was a cruciform piece of wood. A sailor or astronomer would sight the long arm along the horizon and the transverse arm would be raised to the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the sun. <b>Markings</b> along its base represented degrees of measurement which could then be converted to angular measurement and eventually north/south position. But the damaging effects looking directly at the sun for {{extended periods of time}} coupled with the varied nature of a ship’s deck while under sail made it a very crude and unreliable instrument to work with. The lack of reliable instruments with which to determine location hindered the efforts of sailors and explorers until the later emergence of more advanced apparatuses.|$|R
40|$|Technical {{prescriptions}} for road inventories specify {{that the road}} width must be measured with a tolerance of 10 cm and that variations larger than the same threshold should be spotted and recorded. In the framework of software development for Mobile Mapping, underway at the Department of Civil Engineering of Parma University, a semi-automatic method for the extraction, the tracking along an image sequence and the measurement of the distance between lane markings was developed. The input data is a sequence of stereo images with known interior and exterior orientation. The program starts by interactively defining a ROI for each lane to be extracted; both images are then rectified {{with respect to a}} common object plane; by edge detection the markings extracted in each image pair; edge pixel are selected and interpolated with a straight line and the distance between these lines measured. From their differences the true distance and the height difference due to the cross slope are computed; the measurement is repeated at specified intervals and recorded. By predicting the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the <b>markings</b> in the next image pair, the sequence is scanned as long as the markings can be reliably extracted. When, for a specified number of successive pairs, no marking is found, the operator is requested to restart the process. The first trials on artificial and real image sequences have shown accuracy well within the specifications and the robustness of the extraction. 1...|$|R

40|$|Background. The {{goal of this}} {{investigation}} was to evaluate adequacy of the design of readily available paediatric cuffed tracheal tubes (CPTT). Methods. In 15 series of cuffed (11) and uncuffed (four) paediatric tracheal tubes (ID: 2. 5 - 7. 0 mm) from four different manufacturers the following dimensions were measured: outer diameter <b>of</b> the tube, <b>position</b> and largest diameter of the tube cuff inflated at 20 cm H 2 O and <b>position</b> <b>of</b> depth <b>markings</b> and compared with age‐related dimensions. Results. Outer diameters for tubes with similar IDs varied markedly between manufacturers and between cuffed and uncuffed tracheal tubes from the same manufacturer. Cuff diameters at 20 cm H 2 O cuff pressure and cross‐sectional cuff area at 20 cm H 2 O cuff pressure did not always cover maximal internal age‐related tracheal diameters and cross‐sectional areas. Placing the tube tip in the mid‐trachea, the cuffs of cuffed tubes with ID 3. 0, 4. 0, or 5. 0 mm would become positioned within the larynx. If the cuffs were placed 1 cm below the cricoid level, many of the tube tips would be dangerously deep within the trachea. Only five of the 11 cuffed tubes had a depth marking. In many of these tubes the distances from depth marking to tube tip were greater than the age‐related minimal tracheal length. Conclusion. Most cuffed paediatric tracheal tubes are poorly designed, in particular the smaller sizes. A better design of cuffed tubes with a short high‐volume, low‐pressure cuff, cuff‐free subglottic space and adequately placed depth markings are urgently needed. Br J Anaesth 2004; 92 : 78 - 8...|$|R
