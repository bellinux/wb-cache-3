25|$|In gas–liquid {{chromatography}} (GLC) the {{stationary phase}} is a liquid such as <b>polydimethylsiloxane,</b> coated on a glass tube. Separation is achieved because the various {{components in the}} gas have different solubility in the stationary phase.

A new in vitro model, called SynVivo Synthetic microvascular network (SMN) was produced by the CFD Research Corporation (CFDRC) and developed using the <b>polydimethylsiloxane</b> (PDMS) based soft-lithography process. The SMN can recreate the complex in vivo vasculature, including geometrical features, flow conditions, and reagent volumes, thereby providing a biologically realistic environment for studying the extravasation cellular behavior, but also for drug delivery and drug discovery.|$|E

25|$|The {{susceptibility}} of a polymer to degradation {{depends on}} its structure. Epoxies and chains containing aromatic functionalities are especially susceptible to UV degradation while polyesters are susceptible to degradation by hydrolysis, while polymers containing an unsaturated backbone are especially susceptible to ozone cracking. Carbon based polymers {{are more susceptible to}} thermal degradation than inorganic polymers such as <b>polydimethylsiloxane</b> and are therefore not ideal for most high-temperature applications. High-temperature matrices such as bismaleimides (BMI), condensation polyimides (with an O-C-N bond), triazines (with a nitrogen (N) containing ring), and blends thereof are susceptible to polymer degradation in the form of galvanic corrosion when bare carbon fiber reinforced polymer CFRP is in contact with an active metal such as aluminium in salt water environments.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two classes}} of {{non-toxic}} anti-fouling coatings. The most common class relies on low friction and low surface energies. Low surface energies result in hydrophobic surfaces. These coatings create a smooth surface which can prevent attachment of larger microorganisms. For example, fluoropolymers and silicone coatings are commonly used. These coatings are ecologically inert but have problems with mechanical strength and long-term stability. Specifically, after days biofilms (slime) can coat the surfaces which buries the chemical activity and allows microorganisms to attach. The current standard for these coatings is <b>polydimethylsiloxane,</b> or PDMS, which consists of a non-polar backbone made of repeating units of silicon and oxygen atoms. The non-polarity of PDMS allows for biomolecules to readily adsorb to its surface in order to lower interfacial energy. However, PDMS also has a low modulus of elasticity that allows {{for the release of}} fouling organisms at speeds of greater than 20 knots. The dependence of effectiveness on vessel speed prevents use of PDMS on slow-moving ships or those that spend significant amounts of time in port.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSelf-healing {{anticorrosive}} coatings require healing agents with hydrophobic {{properties and}} low glass transition temperature. <b>Polydimethylsiloxanes</b> are group of compounds with {{high degree of}} hydrophobicity and very low glass transition temperatures. The nature of functional group of core material highly affect the properties of resultant microcapsules. Therefore, in this work, three <b>polydimethylsiloxanes</b> with different functional groups were successfully encapsulated in urea-formaldehyde microcapsules for self-healing applications through oil-in-water (OIW) emulsion polymerization. The resultant microcapsules were analyzed via Fourier transformed Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) for structural confirmation, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for the thermal behaviour, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for size and morphology, and electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) for the elemental composition. For OH and vinyl terminated PDMS, microcapsules had diameters {{in the range of}} 100 to 500 μm while for Epoxy terminated PDMS microcapsules diameters were in the range of 50 to 100 μm.

40|$|The name {{silicone}} {{encompasses a}} large number of compounds based on polydialkylsiloxanes; amongst them, the most common are the trimethylsilyloxy-terminated <b>polydimethylsiloxanes</b> of the structure: These are linear polymers, liquid even at very high molecular weights. Numerous other structures can easily be obtained, either by substitution of methyl groups by other groups like-CH = CH 2,-H,-CH 2 -CH 2 -CF 3 or by replacing some of the Me 2 SiO 2 / 2 chain units with MeSiO 3 / 2 or SiO 4 / 2 units where the silicon is substituted with 3 or 4 oxygens to give non-linear branched structures (1). The preferred polymers for pharmaceutical applications are the ones essentially substituted by methyl groups.
