50|$|The {{incidence}} rate {{is the number}} of new cases per population at risk in a given time period. When the denominator is the sum of the <b>person-time</b> of the at risk population, it is also known as the incidence density rate or <b>person-time</b> {{incidence rate}}. In the same example as above, the incidence rate is 14 cases per 1000 person-years, because the incidence proportion (28 per 1,000) is divided by the number of years (two). Using <b>person-time</b> rather than just time handles situations where the amount of observation time differs between people, or when the population at risk varies with time. Use of this measure implies the assumption that the incidence rate is constant over different periods of time, such that for an incidence rate of 14 per 1000 persons-years, 14 cases would be expected for 1000 persons observed for 1 year or 50 persons observed for 20 years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{passenger}} transport amount is increasing quickly in China in recent years. It was 15. 9, 17. 9, 18. 8 and 19. 8 billion <b>person-times</b> in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. One billion <b>person-times</b> were increased yearly. But treatments of {{passenger transport}} excrement {{have become a}} {{more and more difficult}} problem. According to calculation passenger transport feces was 19. 8 million tons and the urine was 59. 5 million tons in 2006. If the excrement is discharged directly along the way, the environment must be polluted seriously, the pestilences will be propagated {{and it will be a}} colossal waste of resources. In this paper, excretory manners and the components of feces and urine were studied and the treatment manners of the passenger transport excrement at home and abroad were compared. A new treatment method of the passenger transport excrement was put forward that the feces and urine were collected separately in passenger transport, then the collected feces and urine were uninstalled at the station, the urine was used openly to fertilize soil and feces was done anaerobic digestion to get the biogas as fuel. Residue after feces digested was made into fertilizer to fertilize soil. The more economic and environmental benefit can be obtained by using this treatment manner.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{financial}} burden of cancers has profound effects {{and there is}} a clear need to explore the issue from different perspectives and for different population groups. This study aimed at investigating inpatient cancer care (ICC) burden in Anhui, a typical inland province of China. Methods The study collected data through a household survey conducted during April to November, 2014 using cluster-randomized sampling and a structured questionnaire administered face-to-face by trained interviewers. Results The survey covered 60, 678 urban and rural residents and 318 <b>person-times</b> of ICC during the past year. Age-adjusted annual <b>person-times</b> and days of ICC per thousand population added up to 4. 24 and 76. 78 respectively and urban residents showed significantly greater admission rates and length of stay than that of rural ones. Total ICC expenditures accounted for 13. 30  % of all that of inpatient care for the whole population. Per-case direct and indirect costs of all types of cancers were estimated as 10365. 1 and 929. 9 RMB. Per-case total cost on ICC at township hospitals was 2142. 3 RMB and at province level hospitals, 17133. 0 RMB. Significant variations in per-case ICC expenditures also existed between patients with different household income and type of medical insurance systems, but patients suffering from different types of cancers. Out-of-pocket payment due to ICC turned out to be catastrophic for 20. 6  % of all cancer patients and 65. 2  % for other medical insurance, 45. 6  % for enrollees of urban and rural medical insurance, 43. 2  % for the 65 to 74  years old. Multi regression revealed statistically significant association between ICC costs and education, reimbursement ratio, household income and level of hospital. Conclusions Cancers characterize low incidence, moderate service use and high expenses. There exist substantial differences between subgroups and part of these variations cannot be explained by pathological factors. ICC expenses are catastrophic in nature to a large part of patients. There is a clear need for more effectively regulating cancer-related medical practices and service seeking behaviors...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of malnutrition {{is very high}} in patients with cancer. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate whether or not a nutrition support team (NST) could benefit esophageal cancer patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Methods: Between June 2012 and April 2014, 50 esophageal cancer patients undergoing concurrent CRT were randomly assigned into two groups: The NST group and the control group. The nutritional statuses of 25 patients in the NST group were managed by the NST. The other 25 patients in the control group underwent the supervision of radiotherapy practitioners. At the end of the CRT, nutritional status, the incidence of complications, and completion rate of radiotherapy were evaluated. Besides, the length of hospital stay (LOS) and the in-patient cost were also compared between these two groups. Results: At the completion of CRF, the nutritional status in the NST group were much better than those in the control group, as evidenced by prealbumin (ALB), transferrin, and ALB parameters (P = 0. 001, 0. 000, and 0. 000, respectively). The complication incidences, including bone marrow suppression (20 % vs. 48 %, P = 0. 037) and complications related infections (12 % vs. 44 %, P = 0. 012), in the NST group were lower and significantly different from the control group. In addition, only one patient in the NST group did not complete the planned radiotherapy while 6 patients in the control group had interrupted or delayed radiotherapy (96 % vs. 76 %, P = 0. 103). Furthermore, the average LOS was decreased by 4. 5 days (P = 0. 001) and in-patient cost was reduced to 1. 26 ± 0. 75 thousand US dollars <b>person-times</b> (P > 0. 05) in the NST group. Conclusions: A NST could provide positive effects in esophageal cancer patients during concurrent CRT on maintaining their nutrition status and improving the compliance of CRF.

40|$|In {{this study}} of acute hip {{fracture}} patients, we show that hip fracture rates differ by gender between community-dwelling seniors and seniors residing in nursing homes. While women have a significantly higher rate of hip fracture among the community-dwelling seniors, men have a significantly higher rate among nursing home residents. INTRODUCTION: Differences in gender-specific hip fracture risk between community-dwelling and institutionalized seniors have not been well established, and seasonality of hip fracture risk has been controversial. METHODS: We analyzed detailed data from 1, 084 hip fracture patients age 65  years and older admitted to one large hospital center in Zurich, Switzerland. In a sensitivity analysis, we extend to de-personalized data from 1, 265 hip fracture patients from the other two large hospital centers in Zurich within the same time frame (total n[*]=[*] 2, 349). The denominators were <b>person-times</b> accumulated by the Zurich population in the corresponding age/gender/type of dwelling stratum in each calendar season {{for the period of}} the study. RESULTS: In the primary analysis of 1, 084 hip fracture patients (mean age 85. 1  years; 78  % women) : Among community-dwelling seniors, the risk of hip fracture was twofold higher among women compared with men (RR[*]=[*] 2. 16; 95  % CI, 1. 74 - 2. 69) independent of age, season, number of comorbidities, and cognitive function; among institutionalized seniors, the risk of hip fracture was 26  % lower among women compared with men (RR[*]=[*] 0. 77; 95  % CI: 0. 63 - 0. 95) adjusting for the same confounders. In the sensitivity analysis of 2, 349 hip fracture patients (mean age 85. 0  years, 76  % women), this pattern remained largely unchanged. There is no seasonal swing in hip fracture incidence. CONCLUSION: We confirm for seniors living in the community that women have a higher risk of hip fracture than men.

To then compare exposure-based rates for drowning with road traffic death rates. METHOD: Retrospective analysis of unintentional drowning mortality and hospitalised morbidity of New South Wales (NSW, Australia) residents 16 + years of age during 1 January to 31 December 2005. Information on population-risk and <b>person-time</b> risk {{was obtained from the}} 2005 NSW Population Health Survey. Analysis of road traffic death data from NSW and population and <b>person-time</b> risk estimates from the Survey of Vehicle Use, Household Travel Surveys and Roads and Traffic Authority Speed Surveys in 2005. RESULTS: Estimated drowning mortality and hospitalised morbidity rates for adults were higher using population-risk and <b>person-time</b> risk exposures compared to a population-based exposure. Population-based estimates of road traffic mortality were four times higher than drowning mortality rates. In contrast, exposure adjusted <b>person-time</b> estimates for drowning were 200 times higher than road traffic fatalities. CONCLUSIONS: Many injury risks are underestimated when the total age-specific population is used to calculate an injury rate instead of actual population-risk or <b>person-time</b> exposure. This can result in the identification of misleading priorities for injury prevention. Drowning risk is strikingly higher than previously thought based on population-based estimates.

The concept of <b>person-time</b> risk can be estimated as the actual time-at-risk in years that all persons contributed to a study. The <b>person-time</b> can be estimated for each patient when a patient changed from diabetic free to diabetic patient. This can be captured for each patient from the variable onset of first diagnoses as a diabetic patient. Thus <b>person-time</b> is employed to derive information on {{the rate at which}} people acquire the disease. Results: Between 1994 and 2004 however there is an increasing trend in the number of individuals in the young, particularly the 18 - 34 year group.

40|$|BackgroundThe {{attacks on}} the World Trade Center (WTC) on Sept 11, 2001 (9 / 11) created the {{potential}} for occupational exposure to known and suspected carcinogens. We examined cancer incidence and its potential association with exposure in the first 7 years after 9 / 11 in firefighters with health information before 9 / 11 and minimal loss to follow-up. MethodsWe assessed 9853 men who were employed as firefighters on Jan 1, 1996. On and after 9 / 11, <b>person-time</b> for 8927 firefighters was classified as WTC-exposed; all <b>person-time</b> before 9 / 11, and <b>person-time</b> after 9 / 11 for 926 non-WTC-exposed firefighters, was classified as non-WTC exposed. Cancer cases were confirmed by matches with state tumour registries or through appropriate documentation. We estimated the ratio of incidence rates in WTC-exposed firefighters to non-exposed firefighters, adjusted for age, race and ethnic origin, and secular trends, with the US National Cancer Institute Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) reference population. CIs were estimated with overdispersed Poisson models. Additional analyses included corrections for potential surveillance bias and modified cohort inclusion criteria.

40|$|A {{misclassification}} {{model is}} presented {{for the assessment}} of bias in rate ratios estimated by <b>person-time</b> analyses of automated medical care databases. The model allows for misclassification of events and <b>person-time</b> and applies to both differentia) and nondifferential errors. The focus is on medical care exposures that occur at discrete points in time (e. g., vaccinations) and on adverse events that are closely associated in time. Bias corrections for rate ratios and binomial tests of equality of event rates dunng exposed and unexposed <b>person-time</b> are developed and illustrated. For nondifferential under- or over-ascertainment of events, the observed rate ratio (r) is unbiased at the null hypothesis (true rate ratio R = 1), negatively biased when R> 1, and positively biased when R < 1 (i. e., biased toward the null). Differential under-ascertainment of unexposed events and differential over-ascertainment of exposed events positively bias r when R = 1. Differential event sensitivities cause larger biases in rate ratios than differential false event rates. False positive exposures bias observed event rate ratios more than false negative exposures. Biases are small when event sensitivities are nondifferential and when less than 10 % of database exposures and events are false. The usefulness of the model for critical sensitivity analysis is illustrated by an example from a linked database study of childhood vaccine safety. Greater dissemination of data quality assessments, sensitivity analyses, and methods used to supplement automated databases are needed to further our understanding of the appropriate role of medica...|$|E

Methods: We matched 30, 220 men with PC to 151, 100 men without PC (comparators) on age (± 2 years) and PC diagnosis/index date. We focused on several methodological issues: 1) to address survival differences between the cohorts we compared rates with and without censoring comparators on the date their matched PC patient died or was censored; 2) to address diagnostic bias, we excluded men {{with a history of}} cancer from the comparator cohort; 3) to address prostate cancer immunity, we graphed the hazard of NPC in both cohorts, with and without prostate cancer as an outcome; 4) we used empirical Bayes methods to explore the effect of adjusting for multiple comparisons. Results: After 18 months of follow-up, cumulative <b>person-time</b> was lower in the PC than comparator cohort due to higher mortality among PC patients. Terminating <b>person-time</b> in comparators at the matched PC patient&# 39;s death or loss to follow-up resulted in comparable <b>person-time</b> up to 30 months of follow-up and lower <b>person-time</b> among comparators thereafter. The hazard of NPC was lower among men with PC than comparators throughout follow-up. There was little difference in rates beyond the first four years of follow-up after removing PC as an outcome. Empirical Bayes adjustment for multiple comparisons had little effect on the estimates. Conclusion: Addressing the issues of competing risks, treatment interference or diagnostic bias, prostate cancer immunity due to radical prostatectomy, and multiple comparisons lowered the deficit rate of NPCs among men with a history of PC compared with those without PC. However, the differing rates of NPCs may also be due to risk factor differences between the cohorts.

40|$|Many {{epidemiological}} studies assessing {{the long term}} health effects of occupational (or non-occupational) exposures have used {{the design of a}} non-concurrent prospective or cohort study. ' 2 In this type of study a group of workers, exposed in the past, is identified and followed up through time to determine the age and time specific mortality rates for several different causes of death. The statistical analysis usually consists of a <b>person-time</b> analysis, resulting in a standardised mortality ra-tio (SMR). The purpose of applying the <b>person-time</b> analysis in cohort studies is to adjust for the influence of the specific age distribution of the population un-der investigation and the changing background mor-tality rates over time. A <b>person-time</b> analysis is a simple statistical procedure in which the person-years of follow up are specified for each age group and period. The person-years in each cell are multiplied by the death rates of the general population for that par-ticular age group and period giving an "expected number of deaths. " The sum of the expected numbers for all the cells combined is the number of expected deaths in the total group. The SMR is calculated by dividing the observed number of deaths by the ex-pected number, multiplied by 100. Dose response relations By analogy with experimental study designs, epi-demiologists have often tried to quantify dose re-sponse relations since the existence of a dose response relation is considered to be strong evidence for an actual causal association. 3 Since the actual level of exposure experienced by the individual study subjects is not usually known, another quantitative measure of exposure is often chosen. This quantitative measure of exposure is duration of employment. One of the underlying assumptions is that the longer a person has worked in a particular occupation the higher the dose he has experienced.

Our objective is to quantify the impact of various common definitions for illness episodes (numerators) and <b>person-time</b> at risk (denominators) in estimating these measures. Methods: Data were from a cohort study in which daily occurrence of illness and children’s attendance in day care centers were re-corded. We compared 4 IR estimates using various definitions of episode and at-risk time units. Results: IRs for diarrhea and colds were highest using child-days, lowest for diarrhea using child-weeks, and lowest for colds using child-months. The 4 methods led to similar IRRs but considerably different IRDs. Conclusion: Incidence rate differences and ratios for infectious diseases can vary by the definition of episode and <b>person-time</b> at risk. This limits {{the value of the}} evidence base on which public health recommendations are formulated. Development of a more standard approach to measurement and reporting of IRs is recommended. Public health questions have been raised about the in-creased incidence rates (IRs) of diarrhea and respiratory infections in day care settings. 1 – 7 However, the numerators and denominators used in estimating IRs and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) or incidence rate differences (IRDs) vary con-siderably.

40|$|Purpose This {{combined}} cross-sectional/cohort study addressed {{research gaps}} by estimating {{the rate of}} non-fatal occupational injury and identifying potential determinants among a population of adolescent farmworkers who are largely Hispanic and migrant. Methods The cohort included 410 farmworkers (aged 13 – 19 years) attending high school in South Texas {{along the border with}} Mexico. Data collection involved a self-administered, Web-based survey that solicited information on demographics, farm work variables including <b>person-time</b> at risk, occupational injury, health status and health risk behaviours. Cox regression was used to identify potential risk factors for non-fatal injury events experienced during a 9 -month recall period...|$|E
40|$|Background: Maternal {{immunization}} {{has gained}} traction {{as a strategy}} to diminish maternal and young infant mortality attributable to infectious diseases. Background rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes are crucial to interpret results of clinical trials in Sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: We developed a mathematical model that calculates a clinical trial’s expected number of neonatal and maternal deaths at an interim safety assessment based on the <b>person-time</b> observed during different risk windows. This model was compared to crude multiplication of the maternal mortality ratio and neonatal mortality rate {{by the number of}} live births. Systematic reviews of severe acute maternal morbidity (SAMM), low birth weight (LBW), prematurity, and major congenital malformations (MCM) in Sub-Saharan African countries were also performed. Findings: Accounting for the <b>person-time</b> observed during different risk periods yields lower, more conservative estimates of expected maternal and neonatal deaths, particularly at an interim safety evaluation soon after a large number of deliveries. Median incidence of SAMM in 16 reports was 40. 7 (IQR: 10. 6 – 73. 3) per 1, 000 total births, and the most common causes were hemorrhage (34 %), dystocia (22 %), and severe hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (22 %). Proportions of liveborn infants who were LBW (median 13. 3 %, IQR: 9. 9 – 16. 4) or premature (median 15. 4 %, IQR: 10. 6 – 19. 1) were similar across geographic region, study design, and institutional setting. The median incidence of MCM per 1, 000 live births wa...|$|E
40|$|Because of {{widespread}} {{distribution of the}} influenza A (H 1 N 1) 2009 monovalent vaccine (pH 1 N 1 vaccine) and the prior association between Guillain-Barre ́ syndrome (GBS) and the 1976 H 1 N 1 influenza vaccine, enhanced surveillance was implemented to estimate the magnitude of any increased GBS risk following administration of pH 1 N 1 vaccine. The authors conducted active, population-based surveillance for incident cases of GBS among 45 million persons residing at 10 Emerging Infections Program sites during October 2009 –May 2010; GBS was defined according to published criteria. The authors determined medical and vaccine history for GBS cases through medical record review and patient interviews. The authors used vaccine coverage data to estimate <b>person-time</b> exposed and unexposed to pH 1 N 1 vaccine and calculated age- and sex-adjusted rate ratios com-paring GBS incidence in these groups, as well as age- and sex-adjusted numbers of excess GBS cases. The authors received 411 reports of confirmed or probable GBS. The rate of GBS immediately following pH 1 N 1 vaccination was 57 % higher than in <b>person-time</b> unexposed to vaccine (adjusted rate ratio 1. 57, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 02, 2. 21), corresponding to 0. 74 excess GBS cases per million pH 1 N 1 vaccine doses (95 % confidence interval: 0. 04, 1. 56). This excess risk was much smaller than that observed during the 1976 vaccine campaign and was comparable to some previous seasonal influenza vaccine risk assessments...|$|E

First, we describe methods for analyzing events in <b>person-time</b> data. Second, we present survival methods for the analysis of time-to-event data. In this context, we illustrate the application of these methods to describe the AIDS incubation period and survival from HIV seroconversion, to determine the factors and biological markers associated with disease progression, and to evaluate effectiveness of therapy. The review ends by illustrating the statistical methods used for the analysis of markers measured repeatedly over tim...|$|E
40|$|Miettinen’s “Incidence Density ” (1) {{corresponds}} to {{the average number of}} cases per unit <b>person-time</b> under risk in a given time interval. Expressions such as incidence (or velocity) which represent the gra-dient of the curve obtained by plotting a continuous and differentiable mathematical function, can be ex-pressed in two ways, average incidence and instan-taneous or point incidence. Incidentally, the same distinction applies t o density. The expression “Incidence Density ” may be a source of confusion, since i t is contrary to customary’ mathematical usage according to which instantane-ous, not average incidence, should be called inci-dence densiiy. Yet, this expression is more than a mere mis...|$|E
