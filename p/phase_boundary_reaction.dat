40|$|We {{study the}} {{nucleation}} and propagation of parallel {{cracks in the}} wake of a solid–solid <b>phase</b> <b>boundary.</b> Our results are also applicable to situations where one has a sharp change of concentration or temperature. We identify conditions on the transformation strain when we expect parallel edge cracks. We show that cracks have little affect on the overall evolution of the <b>phase</b> <b>boundary.</b> We also show that cracks nucleate when the <b>phase</b> <b>boundary</b> has propagated a certain distance from the free edge. The cracks have uniform spacing and their tips reach slightly beyond the <b>phase</b> <b>boundary.</b> Subsequently all cracks propagate with the propagating <b>phase</b> <b>boundary</b> in such a manner that the spacing remains uniform and the tips reach just beyond the <b>phase</b> <b>boundary.</b> Importantly, we show that there is no period-doubling or other instabilities common to thermal cracking when the gradient is small...|$|R
40|$|Ion {{transfer}} at liquid {{vertical bar}} liquid junctions {{is one of}} the most fundamental processes in nature. It occurs coupled to simultaneous electron transfer at the line junction (or triple <b>phase</b> <b>boundary)</b> formed by the two liquids in contact to an electrode surface. The triple <b>phase</b> <b>boundary</b> can be assembled from a redox active microdroplet deposit of a water-immiscible liquid on a suitable electrode surface immersed into aqueous electrolyte. Ion transfer voltammetry measurements at this type of electrode allow both thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for coupled ion and electron transfer processes to be obtained. This overview summarises some recent advances in understanding and application of triple <b>phase</b> <b>boundary</b> redox processes at organic liquid vertical bar aqueous electrolyte vertical bar working electrode junctions. The design of novel types of electrodes is considered based on (i) extended triple <b>phase</b> <b>boundaries,</b> (ii) porous membrane processes, (iii) hydrodynamic effects, and (iv) generator-collector triple <b>phase</b> <b>boundary</b> systems. Novel facilitated ion transfer processes and photo-electrochemical processes at triple <b>phase</b> <b>boundary</b> electrodes are proposed. Potential future applications of triple <b>phase</b> <b>boundary</b> redox systems in electrosynthesis, sensing, and light energy harvesting are indicated...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews {{our recent}} {{studies on the}} {{nucleation}} and kinetics of propagating <b>phase</b> <b>boundaries</b> in an elastic bar and relates them to various admissibility criteria. First, we discuss how the field equations and jump conditions of the quasi-static theory of such a bar must be supplemented with additional constitutive information pertaining to the initiation and evolution of <b>phase</b> <b>boundaries.</b> The kinetic relation relates the driving traction f at a <b>phase</b> <b>boundary</b> to the <b>phase</b> <b>boundary</b> velocity ṡ; thus f = φ (ṡ), where φ is a materially-determined function. The nucleation criterion specifies a critical value of f at an incipient <b>phase</b> <b>boundary.</b> We then incorporate inertial effects, and we find {{in the context of}} the Riemann problem that, as long as <b>phase</b> <b>boundary</b> velocities are subsonic, the theory again needs — and has room for — a nucleation criterion and a kinetic relation. Finally, we describe the sense in which each of three widely studied admissibility criteria for <b>phase</b> <b>boundaries</b> is equivalent to a specific kinetic relation of the form f = φ (ṡ) for a particular choice of φ A kinetic relation based on thermal activation theory is also discussed...|$|R
