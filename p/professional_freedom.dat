5|$|After {{breaking}} up with Owen, Cristina continues to excel at surgery and becomes de facto chief of cardio. Although supportive of Meredith's choice to become a mother, Cristina points {{out the fact that}} it has hurt Meredith's career and clinical judgement. This causes a wedge in their friendship. Grey attempts to catch up professionally with a research trial, but the divide widens when Cristina's trial overshadows Grey's and steals Grey's resources. When Dr. Shane Ross, a second-year resident, stands up to Meredith for her, Cristina gives Shane a kiss. Later, she begins sleeping with him, as well as becoming his mentor and passing on the skills learned from Altman. Cristina's project is immensely successful and she is informed that she could be considered for the Harper Avery award from her 3-D printing of a heart conduit. Grey and Yang reconcile when Grey acknowledges that Yang is correct, she has surpassed Grey, and that Grey is jealous of Yang's <b>professional</b> <b>freedom</b> and success, while her own is hampered by her family.|$|E
500|$|Hordern {{first met}} the British theatre {{director}} Jonathan Miller in 1968. Miller, {{who had long}} been an admirer of Hordern, offered him {{the part of the}} agonistic Professor Parkin in his forthcoming television drama Whistle and I'll Come to You. Hordern, who had heard positive things of Miller from theatrical friends, likewise thought highly of the director, and was quick to take up location filming in Norfolk that year. [...] He came to like Miller's way of working, such as having the freedom to improvise instead of adhering to the strict rules of a script; the actor wrote in his autobiography that he had never experienced that degree of <b>professional</b> <b>freedom.</b> The programme was released towards the end of 1968 and was a hit with audiences and critics. Mark Duguid of the British Film Institute called it [...] "a masterpiece of economical horror that remains every bit as chilling as the day it was first broadcast", while a journalist for The Telegraph, writing in 2010 about that year's remake starring John Hurt, reminded readers of the [...] "brilliant Sixties production by Jonathan Miller [...] Michael Hordern made a fine, crusty Parkin". The year ended with a role in Peter Hall's production of Edward Albee's A Delicate Balance at the Aldwych Theatre. The piece received lukewarm reviews, with Hilary Spurling of The Spectator thinking Hordern was [...] "ill-served" [...] as the principal character, Tobias.|$|E

5000|$|Herendeen's {{first novel}} Phyllida and the Brotherhood of Philander was {{initially}} issued by a subsidy publisher with the subtitle A Bisexual Regency Romance, in 2005. Harper Collins released a slightly altered {{version of the}} book in 2008 without that subtitle. Herendeen's atypical Regency Romance introduces a central same-sex love story into a Regency-set tale of a marriage of convenience which otherwise obeys many of the conventions of genre romance. The heroine Phyllida, an author(ess), offers the hero {{a quid pro quo}} of [...] "irregular" [...] liberty in marriage - his sexual freedom for her literary and <b>professional</b> <b>freedom.</b> The novel delivers the generically required account of the development of the couple's erotic and tender bonds through trials to deep and permanent commitment, while Phyllida's authorship supplies Herendeen's text with a common metafictional feature of postmodern genre romance: a novel-within-the-novel, exploring forbidden sexuality in the fashionable manner of the era. Passages of Phyllida's fiction are rendered as pastiches of the great Gothic tradition (e.g. Charles Maturin, Ann Radcliffe, Matthew [...] "Monk" [...] Lewis, Clara Reeve, Mary Shelley) the language and conventions of which are at once mocked and relished.|$|E

50|$|Liselotte Grschebina (Grjebina), photographer, born 1908 in Karlsruhe, Germany. Her {{parents were}} Rosa and Otto Billigheimer, a Jewish couple. Her {{father was killed}} in 1916 while serving in the German army. In 1925-29 Grschebina studied {{painting}} and graphic design at the local art academy, Badische Landeskunstschule, Karlsruhe (BLK) and studied commercial photography at the School of Applied Arts in Stuttgart. In January 1932 Grschebina opens Bilfoto, her own studio, announcing her specialization in child photography, and takes on students. In 1933, following the Nazis come to power and the restrictions on <b>professional</b> <b>freedom</b> for Jews, Grschebina closed her studio. Before leaving Germany, she marries Dr. Jacob (Jasha) Grschebin, and the two reach Tel Aviv in March 1934. In 1934, Grschebina opens the Ishon studio on Allenby Road with her friend Ellen Rosenberg (Auerbach), previously {{a partner in the}} Berlin photographic studio ringl + pit. In 1936 the Ishon studio is closed when Rosenberg leaves the country; Grschebina continues to work from her home. In 1934-47 Grschebina is appointed the official photographer for the Zionist women’s organization WIZO. In 1939, together with fellow photographers of German origin gathered in Tel Aviv, establishes the Palestine Professional Photographers Association (PPPA), the first independent photographers organization in the country. Between the 1930s to 1950s Grschebina takes photographs for Palestine Railways, the large dairy company Tnuva, kibbutzim, and various private businesses. Liselotte Grschebina dies in Petah Tikva at the age of 86, on 14 June 1994. The archive of Liselotte Grschebina’s photographs were given to the Israel Museum by her son, Beni Gjebin and his wife Rina, Shoham, with the assistance of Rachel and Dov Gottesmann, Tel Aviv, Geneva and London.|$|E
5000|$|Vadim {{selected}} Rebecca De Mornay to {{play the}} lead. [...] "He wasn't {{the kind of man}} I expected to meet," [...] recalled the actor. [...] "I found him very funny and warm. He makes me feel secure and I feel like I can trust him not to turn this into an exploitation film." [...] Rebecca De Mornay had seen the original movie when she was younger. She said during filming that:In some ways I'm sorry they're even using the same title. Our story {{has nothing to do with}} the first film.It's entirely different. This is an American love story set in New Mexico. But of course it was on the strength of the title that Vadim was able to promote interest in the project.Roger Vadim stated during filming:What is important for me here is once again to tell the story of a sexy, funny and somewhat outrageous young woman within a social context. That's why, even though practically everything about the original has been changed and I don't consider this in any sense a remake, I feel justified in using the title... Santa Fe in the 80s is not Saint Tropez in the 50s, except perhaps in the sense that there is no gap between the classes. Rich people, artists, blue collar and Indian - different parts of the society mix together, which was true of St Tropez before it became the circus it is now. And, more important, in the last 30 years women have won many freedoms - social freedom, <b>professional</b> <b>freedom,</b> sexual freedom. Robin, the girl in the film, claims all these freedoms - in a way that's cerebral, she's aware of her personality, while Bardot behaved totally instinctively.|$|E
