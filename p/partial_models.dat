The film critic and author Maitland McDonagh argues that Argento's influences for Tenebrae were far broader than just his own films or previous Italian thrillers. She refers to the strong narrative in the film {{as an example of}} [...] "the most paranoid excesses of film noir." [...] McDonagh suggests that Fritz Lang's Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (1956) ("in which a man convicted of murder on false evidence... is in fact guilty of the murder") and Roy William Neill's Black Angel (1946) ("in which a man who tries to clear a murder suspect does so at the cost of learning that he himself is the killer") both use such a similar plot twist to Tenebrae that Argento may have used them as <b>partial</b> <b>models</b> for his story.|$|E

Building Information Modeling (BIM) is recognized as the new paradigm since Computer Aided Design (CAD).

However, the daily routine on a construction jobsite has specific requirements and creates certain limitations regarding the usage of information stored in a BIM model. Such limitations include the scarcity of computing resources and trained personnel. One of the requirements is to view a <b>partial</b> <b>model</b> instead of the original, complete model.

In this research an ontology-based method to extract a <b>partial</b> <b>model</b> from a complete BIM model is explored.

40|$|The {{alternating}} fixpoint of a logic {{program with}} negation is defined constructively. The underlying idea is monotonically {{to build up}} a set of negative conclusions until the least fixpoint is reached, using a transformation related to the one that defines stable models. From a fixed set of negative conclusions, the positive conclusions follow (without deriving any further negative ones), by traditional Horn clause semantics. The union of positive and negative conclusions is called the alternating xpoint <b>partial</b> <b>model.</b> The name "alternating" was chosen because the transformation runs in two passes; the first pass transforms an underestimate of the set of negative conclusions into an (intermediate) overestimate; the second pass transforms the overestimate into a new underestimate; the composition of the two passes is monotonic. The principal contributions of this work are (1) that the alternating fixpoint <b>partial</b> <b>model</b> is identical to the well-founded <b>partial</b> <b>model,</b> and (2) that alternating xpoint logic is at least as expressive as xpoint logic on all structures.

Learning by modelling is also challenging because students can easily get {{overwhelmed by the}} inherent complexities of the task. This study investigated whether offering partially worked-out models can facilitate students’ modelling practices and promote learning. Partially worked-out models were expected to aid model construction by revealing the overall structure of the model, and thus enabling student to create better models and learn from the experience. This assumption was tested in high school biology classes where students modelled the human glucose-insulin regulatory system. Students either received support {{in the form of}} a <b>partial</b> <b>model</b> that outlined the basic structure of the glucose-insulin system (PM condition; n[*]=[*] 26), an extended <b>partial</b> <b>model</b> that also contained a set of variables students could use to complete the model (PM+ condition; n[*]=[*] 21), or no support (control condition; n[*]=[*] 23).
