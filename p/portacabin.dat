50|$|Initially {{there were}} no {{facilities}} on site - gliders were rigged and derigged each day - so the priority was to erect a hangar. A <b>portacabin</b> was also installed {{to act as a}} clubhouse. Much work has been put into improving the grass, and it is now able to support year round operations. Over the last 3 years club members have erected a second hangar and the original <b>portacabin</b> has been replaced with a new club house which was officially opened in April 2011.|$|E

50|$|After 2010 the site's use {{was limited}} to crew changes; the driver depot at Healey Mills closed in 2012, being {{relocated}} to <b>portacabins</b> at Wakefield Kirkgate station after 4 February 2012.|$|R
50|$|Like {{many small}} villages, Bredfield {{was unable to}} sustain not only the school but also a privately run grocery shop, the last one also closing in 1986. However, the villagers got {{together}} and started a community shop, initially in a <b>portacabin</b> but eventually moving into a purpose-built extension to the village hall.|$|E

50|$|For the 2008 and {{subsequent}} seasons, Arundel Museum {{was able to}} keep a presence in the town by opening in temporary <b>portacabin</b> accommodation, sponsored by local entrepreneurs, next to the Car Park in Mill Road. In October 2011, it moved again, and again to temporary accommodation, this time in Crown Yard Mews, where the museum took on the role as tourist information point for Arundel..|$|E
50|$|The Extensions were a {{structure}} {{made up of}} <b>Portacabins,</b> established in 1996, originally {{intended to be a}} two-year temporary construction. Housing (for secondary) four classrooms, three offices, two labs and (for primary) two classrooms, they were removed in 2011.|$|R
50|$|The {{combined}} school was renamed as St Benedict's College. St Malachy's was demolished and a rebuilding programme {{began on the}} St Olcan's site {{around the same time}} to accommodate new playing courts for tennis/basketball/soccer, along with new <b>portacabins</b> for additional classrooms.|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} the final step in the Bachelor of Science program in Building Construction Engineering, Department of Engineering Sciences, Uppsala University. The {{purpose of this study}} is to {{highlight}} the difficulties and possibilities that could involve the introduction of new energy efficient technologies and changing work around this technology. This study focuses on energy use at a construction site or other temporary workplace where so-called <b>portacabins</b> are in place to address the need for temporary facilities. The method for obtaining knowledge on the subject was mainly interviews with site managers working in Svevia AB's various activities. In conjunction with the interviews I visited construction sites and <b>portacabins</b> if it was possible. My most important suggestion to Svevia AB concerns a better organization in order to make poratacabins more efficient on energy and costs. The company should also evaluate and monitor the energy efficient <b>portacabins</b> that are in operation. Expected energy savings of new technology may not materialize if there are gaps in information, education, technical services and technical maintenance. It is very important to utilize the experiences of new technology. The experience should be used for the design of training, information and service schedules...|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} opened on 2 July 1990, along with Broombridge, Castleknock, and Leixlip Confey. Like the latter {{three of these}} {{stations}} it underwent an upgrade project in 2000 {{which led to the}} <b>portacabin</b> booking office being replaced by a permanent station building and the platforms being lengthened. The ticket office is open from 06:30 to 13:00, Monday to Friday. It is closed on Saturday and Sunday.|$|E
50|$|The {{station is}} {{parallel}} to the Royal Canal near the 12th lock. It has two through platforms. It originally featured a <b>portacabin</b> booking office; however, a permanent station building was constructed (and the platforms lengthened) as part of the upgrade of the Western Commuter service in 2000. The ticket office is open from 06:30 AM to 13:00 PM, Monday to Friday. It is closed on Saturday and Sunday.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, a new {{activity}} centre {{was built}} in Coylton {{on the site of}} the existing courts by South Ayrshire Council. The club benefitted by having three brand new courts complete with floodlighting, which are now leased from South Ayrshire Council. To complement these courts, the club purchased a <b>portacabin</b> as a clubhouse. In the last couple of years a more permanent structure has been built to serve as the clubhouse with all the required facilities.|$|E
50|$|An area {{of special}} track exists for RIS-1530-PLT testing of {{on-track}} plant, including lengths of track for brake testing {{at up to}} 1:25 and sharp 80 m reverse curves. The Lodge Lane area also contains <b>portacabins</b> for visiting staff, and a 300 sqm sq ft inspection shed for railway vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The station {{later became}} a centre of {{helicopter}} operations over Northern Ireland when St Angelo {{was transferred to the}} Army and used as an accommodation barracks for the Ulster Defence Regiment and other British Army regiments during The Troubles in the province, with most personnel housed in a vast array of temporary <b>portacabins.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1995 the School {{moved out}} of the Nissen huts that they had been based in since moving to Wethersfield and into 4 <b>Portacabins</b> inside the T2 hangar; these are {{currently}} split with two being used for accommodation and two being used for offices, briefing rooms, stores and to provide the School with a kitchen area.|$|R
50|$|Nerve Radio is the Student Union run {{radio station}} for Bournemouth University. It {{was started in}} 1995 by two Bournemouth University {{students}} David Harber and James Bromley in a <b>portacabin</b> on the University's Talbot Campus, and now operates online through its website. At some point during each academic year, Nerve Radio broadcasts on a temporary FM licence around the Bournemouth area, usually during the University's Fresher's / Arrivals period in September {{and at the end}} of the Spring term in March.|$|E
50|$|During March 2014, all {{buses and}} {{employees}} {{transferred to the}} new depot on Lintonville Parkway, which is a five-minute walk and drive from the original depot. The new depot was officially opened by Ashington's longest serving driver and engineer. The drivers' rest room and supervisor's office remained in the old depot building until November 2014, when a nearby derelict building was refurbished for the drivers' rest room. The supervisor's office was moved into a <b>portacabin</b> on the main area of the bus station. As of August 2015, the depot had been completely demolished.|$|E
50|$|Shortly after 6.30PM on 28 February, nine shells were {{launched}} from the lorry, {{which had been}} parked on Monaghan Street, about 250 yds m from the base. At least one 50 lb shell landed on a <b>portacabin</b> containing a canteen, where many officers were having their evening tea break. Nine police officers were killed and 37 people were hurt, including 25 civilian police employees; the highest death toll inflicted on the RUC in its history. Another shell hit the observation tower, while the rest landed {{inside and outside the}} perimeter of the base.|$|E
5000|$|In August 2014, former Blackpool defender Alex Baptiste reminisced on {{his time}} at Squires Gate: [...] "No balls in training, having to run on the beach because the pitch had been frozen for two weeks, no food after training, leaks in the <b>Portacabins,</b> having to buy our own weights - just random stuff like that! It was {{definitely}} an experience!" ...|$|R
50|$|CFU {{members have}} freely donated their services, skills and time {{throughout}} {{the past ten}} years, working hard in many roles within the club. For example, CFU helped carry out work to improve the office <b>portacabins,</b> the fans' bar and the gym at the R Costings Abbey. Over the years, CFU have also donated many items ranging from training goals, bicycles, computers, televisions and radios for the blind.|$|R
50|$|The {{triangular}} immersion pool, which {{like the}} Leechwell is listed, will actually become a key {{feature of the}} Leechwell Garden, a new public open space. Work on the garden will start when the current building work is completed and the set of <b>portacabins</b> is removed. The design {{and implementation of the}} garden will be a joint collaboration between South Hams District Council and the Leechwell Garden Association.|$|R
50|$|There was {{originally}} a full-time station master and ticket office. The 1929 ticket office was constructed of timber on tall wooden piles attached {{to both the}} Brook Road bridge and the ground below. It was located at the Moorland Road {{side of the bridge}} at road level. This has now been replaced by a <b>portacabin</b> styled ticket office on the westbound platform and a ticket dispensing machine. The ticket office is manned on weekdays during the morning peak times. The station is also part of the Penalty Fares area.|$|E
50|$|From {{an early}} point in {{planning}} the new development of Cambourne, Christian church leaders {{expressed an interest}} {{to be involved in}} helping create the new community. The original Cambourne masterplan included space for a church located at the east end of the High Street. This ultimately resulted in the Church of England, the Baptist Union of Great Britain, the Methodist Church of Great Britain, and the United Reformed Church working together to form the Local Ecumenical Partnership called Cambourne Church.In late 1999, as the first homes became occupied, the church was already open. The first full-time residential minister was appointed in early 2001. The waiting room of the doctor's surgery (now the dentists) became the first meeting place. Before funds to build the permanent Church Centre were raised, an old <b>Portacabin</b> classroom was reconditioned by local residents and placed on the corner of Eastgate and Jeavons Lane opposite the planned Church site. It became the first community building available for Cambourne residents, opening as The Ark in 2002. This quickly became a home {{to a wide variety of}} community groups.|$|E
50|$|The {{most recent}} Cosford signal box stood {{a little to}} the west of the station. As well as forming a block post this signal box {{controlled}} entrance and exit to up and down refuge loops and the previous rail connection into the adjacent RAF site from the up refuge loop. It has been abolished as a result of the 2006 resignalling scheme with control passing to Madeley Junction. Much of the redundant signalling equipment has been distributed to various heritage railways, the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway is believed to have received the majority. This structure is thought to have been the last signal box constructed by the Great Western Railway in Shropshire. Much of the contents and structure of this 1939 constructed signalbox has been salvaged for reuse on another heritage railway. The remaining brickwork was demolished in the small hours of Sunday 21 October 2007. Remarkably, the signalman's <b>portacabin</b> style privy remains in-situ as of late August 2008.The advent of longer trains destined for Ironbridge Power Station has resulted in much reduced used of the refuge loops as they are too short to accommodate the length of today's coal trains.|$|E
50|$|The stadium's frontage, often {{criticized for}} {{negatively}} portraying the stadium, was refurbished during late June and early July 2007. This involved recladding <b>portacabins</b> {{that serve as}} Cambridge United's offices and general maintenance of the stadium's car park. The following summer the rear wall of the Newmarket Road End was redecorated in amber with a black 'Amber Army' motif, a term for the club's supporters.|$|R
5000|$|A severe {{landslip}} immediately {{south of}} the station at Cheddleton has always prevented the installation of a passing loop, and therefore {{the development of the}} original [...] "down" [...] platform (which cannot carry passenger trains). However a lack of space on the [...] "up" [...] platform had resulted in the catering facilities being located on this otherwise unused side of the station, in the form of <b>Portacabins.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In August 2014, former Blackpool defender Alex Baptiste reminisced on {{his time}} at Squires Gate: [...] "No balls in training, having to run on the beach because the pitch had been frozen for two weeks, no food after training, leaks in the <b>Portacabins,</b> having to buy our own weights - just random stuff like that!
