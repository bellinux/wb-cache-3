40|$|The {{feasibility}} of producing Direct Reduced Iron from cold-bonded self-reducing composite pellets made from Anglo American Kumba Iron Ore Sishen upgraded slimes was considered on laboratory scale. Composite pellets {{were made by}} mixing Sishen upgraded slimes, coke and different binders using a <b>pelletizing</b> <b>disc</b> by addition of moisture. Binders investigated were dextrin, carboxymethylcellulose, calcium-lignosulphonate and combination of dextrin and bentonite. Dry strengths in excess of 300 N /pellet were attained by curing the pellets under ambient conditions. Dry strength of composite pellets increased with increase in binder quantity and decreased with increase in coke quantity. The composite pellets reduced within 20 minutes to degrees of metallisation in excess of 90 % at 1100 oC, with decrepitation indices significantly below 5 %. The degree of metallisation of composite pellets increased {{with an increase in}} reduction temperature (from 1000 to 1100 oC), reduction time (20 vs. 40 minutes) and coke quantity (15 vs. 20 wt. %). Carboxymethylcellulose was identified as the most economical and suitable binder for the Sishen upgraded slimes. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{ferroelectric}} {{lead zirconate titanate}} PZT (0. 523 / 0. 477) nanocrystalline powders have been successfully synthesized by an alkoxide based sol-gel process. Crystallinity of the prepared ceramic powders was studied using X-ray diffractometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were performed to study morphology of the calcined powders. EDX analysis was employed to demonstrate purity of the synthesized powders. Surface nature of the powders was studied by using FTIR technique. TGA/DTA analysis was employed to study thermal behaviour of powders. Spectroscopic techniques (FTIR and XRD) {{results indicated that the}} as-dried amorphous powders can be completely crystallized at 600 °C. In order to investigate the densification behaviour of the calcined powders, the crystalline PZT powders were <b>pelletized</b> into <b>discs</b> and sintered at various temperatures from 900 °C to 1150 °C, with a heating rate of 10 °C/min and holding time of 2 h to find the optimum combination of temperature and time to produce high density ceramics. Microstructural characterization was conducted on the fractured surface of the samples using SEM. It was found that the PZT ceramics calcined at 600 °C for 4 h then sintered at 1050 °C for 2 h had maximal density (98...|$|R
