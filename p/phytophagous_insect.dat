40|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{diversity of}} <b>phytophagous</b> <b>insects</b> may {{be attributable to}} their narrow specialization as parasites of plants, with selective tradeoffs associated with alternate host plants driving genetic divergence of host-associated forms via ecological speciation. Most <b>phytophagous</b> <b>insects</b> in turn are attacked by parasitoid insects, which are similarly specialized and may also undergo host-associated differentiation (HAD). A particularly interesting possibility is that HAD by <b>phytophagous</b> <b>insects</b> might lead to HAD in parasitoids, as parasitoids evolve divergent lineages on the new host plant-specific lineages of their phytophagous hosts. We call this process ‘cascading host-associated differentiation’ (cascading HAD). We tested for cascading HAD in parasitoids of two <b>phytophagous</b> <b>insects,</b> each of which consists of genetically distinct host-associated lineages on the same pair of goldenrods (Solidago). Each parasitoid exhibited significant host-associated genetic divergence, and the distribution and patterns of divergence are consistent with divergence in sympatry. Although evidence for cascading HAD is currently limited, our results suggest that it could {{play an important role}} in the diversification of parasitoids attacking <b>phytophagous</b> <b>insects.</b> The existence of cryptic host-associated lineages also suggests that the diversity of parasitoids may be vastly underestimated...|$|R

This divide is evident in studies of <b>phytophagous</b> <b>insects,</b> a highly diverse group that has been frequently investigated with the implicit or explicit goal of understanding its diversity. Whereas ecological studies of <b>phytophagous</b> <b>insects</b> increasingly {{recognize the importance of}} tri-trophic interactions as determinants of niche dimensions such as host-plant associations, evolutionary studies typically neglect the third trophic level. Here we attempt to reconcile ecological and evolutionary approaches through the concept of the ecological niche. We specifically present a tri-trophic niche concept as a foil to the traditional bi-trophic niche concept for <b>phytophagous</b> <b>insects.</b> We argue that these niche concepts have different implications for understanding herbivore community structure, population divergence, and evolutionary diversification. To this end, we offer contrasting empirical predictions of bi- and tri-trophic niche concepts for patterns of community structure, the process of population divergence, and patterns of evolutionary diversification of <b>phytophagous</b> <b>insects...</b>|$|R

40|$|Phytophagous insects use a {{wide range}} of {{indicators}} or associated cues to avoid laying eggs in sites where offspring survival is low. For insects that lay eggs in flowers, these unsuitable sites may be created by the host plant’s resource allocation to flowers. In the sequentially flowering host plant, Yucca glauca, late-opening distal flowers {{are more likely to be}} aborted in the presence of already-initiated basal fruits because they are strong resource sinks. If flowers are aborted, all eggs of the <b>phytophagous</b> <b>insect,</b> Tegeticula yuccasella, within the flower die. We used the <b>phytophagous</b> <b>insect</b> T. yuccasella that lays eggs in and pollinates host plant Y. glauca flowers to test the hypothesis that <b>phytophagous</b> <b>insect</b> females are less likely to invest eggs in host plant flowers if basal fruits are present because they are more likely to be aborted. We also investigated potential predictors of arrival of T. yuccasella at inflorescences at the onset of flowering. These factors may influence a phytophagous insect’s decisions to select oviposition sites. We carried out a behavioral experiment using wild-caught T. yuccasella females on manipulated inflorescences with distal flowers with basal fruits and without fruits. As potential predictors of T. yuccasella arriving at inflorescences, we used floral display size and day of onset of flowering. In support of our hypothesis, our experimental results showed that T. yuccasella was significantly less likely to oviposit in distal flowers on inflorescences with basal fruits. We also found that T. yuccasella arrival was higher at inflorescences with larger floral display size and earlier in the flowering season. These findings uncover a novel indicator of unsuitable oviposition sites—the presence of basal fruits, that phytophagous insects use to make oviposition decisions. Further, our study contributes to the growing body of evidence that shows that females prefer sites that increase the probability of survival of their offspring...|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that rapid y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) accumulation is a plant defense against phytophagous insects was investigated. Simulation of mechanical damage resulting from <b>phytophagous</b> <b>insect</b> activity increased soybean (Glycine max L.) leaf GABA 10 - to 25 -fold within 1 to 4 min. Pulverizing leaf tissue {{resulted in a}} value of 2. 15 (±O. 11 SE) ~mol GABA per gram fresh weight. Increasing the GABA levels in a synthetic diet from 1. 6 to 2. 6 Jlffiol GABA per gram fresh weight reduced the growth rates, developmental rates, total biomass (50 % reduction), and survival rates (30 % reduction) of cultured Oblique banded leaf-roller (OBLR) (Choristonellra rosacealla Harris) larvae. In field experiments OBLR larvae were found predominantly on young terminal leaves which have a reduced capacity to produce GABA in response to mechanical damage. Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) is a cytosolic enzyme which catalyses the decarboxylation of L-Glu to GABA. GAD is a calmodulin binding enzyme whose activity is stimulated dramatically by increased cytosolic H+ or Ca 2 + ion concentrations. <b>Phytophagous</b> <b>insect</b> activity will disrupt the cellular compartmentation of H+ and Ca 2 +, activate GAD and subsequent GABA accumulation.

40|$|Abstract Mary Jane West-Eberhard has {{suggested}} that plasticity may be of primary importance in promoting evolutionary innovation and diversification. Here, we explore {{the possibility that the}} diversification of <b>phytophagous</b> <b>insects</b> may have occurred through such a process, using examples from nymphalid butterflies.
