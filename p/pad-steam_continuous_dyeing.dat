40|$|Tencel, a {{regenerated}} {{cellulosic fibre}} is synthesised by an environmental friendly process. It can be dyed {{by the same}} dye types as recommended for other cellulosic fibres. The behaviour of reactive dyes on Tencel woven fabric varies with the type and the density of woven fabric. The highly crystalline Tencel fibre is less easy to dye uniformly by the <b>continuous</b> <b>dyeing</b> methods because of the short time of contact between the dye and fibre. The purpose of this work is to investigate the influences of weave structure on dyeing of standard Tencel fabric using reactive <b>dyes</b> applied by <b>continuous</b> <b>dyeing</b> methods. Programmes are developed using Matlab software to measure the fabric porosity and uniformity of fibre coloration (UFC) in the yarns of the woven fabric. UFC is also measured subjectively. Firstly, fabrics of four different weave structures (plain, 2 / 1, 3 / 1, 5 / 1 twill fabric) are studied. The visual depth and UFC standard deviation values is highest for the 2 / 1 twill fabric, gradually reducing towards the 5 / 1 twill fabric. Secondly, nine plain weave fabrics of different fabric densities are dyed using different padding procedures - a liquor temperature of 40 ⁰C with a 1 min dwell time and with a 5 min dwell time, and liquor at room temperature without any dwell time. The padded fabrics are then fixed by pad-steam, pad-dry-steam, pad-batch and pad-dry-thermosol <b>continuous</b> <b>dyeing</b> processes. To improve colour depth the plain weave fabrics are given a caustic pre-treatment and their dyeing characteristics are compared with untreated fabrics. The causticised fabrics are dyed using the same padding procedures, for comparison. The optimum dyeing procedure {{is found to be}} padding with a dwell time of 1 min in liquor at 40 ⁰C after caustic pre-treatment to achieve the highest visual depth, dye uptake, and uniformity of fibre coloration. The fibrillation tendency of the Tencel plain weave fabrics is also reduced using this procedure. Numerical relationships are established to enable the prediction of dyeing properties such as colour strength, UFC for fabrics of different weave structures, applied by the various <b>continuous</b> <b>dyeing</b> processes.

The utilization realizes through the engagement of lithium-bromide absorption heat pumps with various energy characteristics such as the heating coefficient (relative conversion ratio COPhp = 1, 15; 1, 7; 2, 2) and the heating capacity. The latter associates with the converted heat-flow energy utilization variant with the heat-transfer medium heating system scheme (one-, twoand multistage heating). The article considers transition to previously not applied service-water preheating due to the technological acceptance of feeding higher temperature water into the dyeing machine and widening specification of the heattransfer media. The authors adduce variants of internal and external energy use and their evaluation based on the relative energy and exergy characteristics. With results of the thermodynamic analysis of the modernized production effectiveness the researchers prove that alongside with traditional and apparent interior utilization of the energy associated with the stream heat recuperation, it is advisable to widen the range of applied heat-transfer media. The transition to the service water twoand multi-stage preheating is feasible. The study shows that the existing energy supply efficiency extremely low index-numbers improve by one or two degrees.

This study combined these two techniques for colouration of wool fabric using two natural dyes derived from the Acacia plant family. The investigation focused on the e®ects of plasma treatment and obtaining unique patterning e®ects. Helium (100 %) and a mixture of helium and nitrogen (95 %/ 5 %) were used as the plasma gases under atmospheric conditions. Plasma treated wool fabric was padded with the above natural dyes. Copper sulphate and ferrous sulphate were applied on the dyed fabric as mordant yielding neutral shades of beige and grey respectively. Up to a 30 % enhancement of dye adsorption on plasma treated wool substrate was observed as compared to untreated sample for both gases used. This higher adsorption indicates the hydrophilic character of the natural dyes used. Key performance parameters such as fastness to washing, rubbing and light were tested and found to be satisfactory.

This collection of dyes has not changed much in recent years. About 60 % of them have C. I. Numbers-i. e., ihe chemical structure of the principle color component is known; 85 % are derivatives of anthraquinone, and of these almost 50 % fall into only five chemical structure subgroups; indigo derivatives and the related thioindigo derivatives account for about 10 % of the list. As a class, vat dyes are expensive, although they share this characteristic with some fiber reactive dyes. One shouid not overlook the 10 % of so-called sulfurized vat dyes, which are more economical hybrids of sulfur and vat dyes. The practical details of using vat dyes in both batch and continuous processes are covered in this second and final part of Chapter 3. Vat dyes generally offer superior fastness properties. Potential drawbacks to selecting vat dyes include a tendency for phototendering and a limited color gamut.

Synthetic dyes and dyeing auxiliaries such as salt and alkali, which are detrimental to the environment, are being replaced by natural dyes and colourants.

40|$|Although much {{evidence}} suggests that calcium (Ca 2 +) usually triggers synaptic vesicle exocytosis and neurotransmitter release, the role of Ca 2 + in vesicle endocytosis and {{in the delivery of}} fusion-competent vesicles (i. e. mobilisation and/or priming) in nerve terminals remains unclear. To address this issue, we have studied synaptic vesicle dynamics in cultured rat neurones under conditions where neurotransmitter release is triggered independently of Ca 2 + using the secretagogue Ruthenium Red (RR). Using a prolonged stimulation protocol, we find that RR causes a rapid increase in neurotransmitter release followed by a gradually decrementing response. In contrast, when release is triggered by moderate membrane depolarisation caused by saline containing 18 mm K+, release is sustained. These observations suggest that when release is triggered independently of a rise in Ca 2 +, endocytosis or vesicle mobilisation/priming are perturbed. Using FM 2 - 10, a fluorescent indicator of synaptic vesicle cycling, we find that neurotransmitter release triggered by RR is accompanied by both uptake and release of this dye, thereby suggesting that vesicle endocytosis is not blocked. To evaluate whether synaptic vesicle mobilisation/priming is perturbed {{in the absence of a}} rise in Ca 2 +, we compared the kinetics of FM 2 - 10 loss during prolonged stimulation. While 18 mm K+ induced gradual and <b>continuous</b> <b>dye</b> loss, RR only induced substantial dye loss during the first minute of stimulation. In the presence of low concentrations of the Ca 2 + ionophore ionomycin, release caused by RR was prolonged.

Recently FCM {{has been investigated}} for cardiac imaging, in particular, for discrimination of cardiac tissue during pediatric open-heart surgery. FCM relies on fluorescent dyes. The current clinical approach of dye delivery is based on systemic injection, which is associated with high dye consumption and adverse clinical events. In this study, we investigated approaches for local dye delivery during FCM imaging based on dye carriers attached to the imaging probe. Using three-dimensional confocal microscopy, automated bench tests, and FCM imaging we quantitatively characterized dye release of carriers composed of open-pore foam only and foam loaded with agarose hydrogel. In addition, we compared local dye delivery with a model of systemic dye delivery in the isolated perfused rodent heart. We measured the signal-to-noise ratio of images acquired in various regions of the heart. Our evaluations showed that foam-agarose dye carriers exhibited a prolonged dye release versus foam-only carriers. Foam-agarose dye carriers allowed reliable imaging of 5 - 9 lines, which is comparable to 4 - 8 min of <b>continuous</b> <b>dye</b> release. Our study in the living heart revealed that the SNR of FCM images using local and systemic dye delivery is not different.

For the CSTR adsorption test, the adsorbent was added at suitable time intervals while the residence time and adsorbent dosage is varied. The Langmuir isotherm data obtained with varying MB concentrations fits the isotherm with an R 2 of 0. 99. The Langmuir parameters from the experiment were a Q (mg/g) of 68. 02 and K (L/mg) of 0. 385 while the RL value was 0. 017, assuring a favourable adsorption.

Vat Blue 1 has been demonstrated {{to be a viable}} colorant for dyeing of PP fiber as a single colorant. Molecular dynamics simulation and solubility parameter (SP) approaches have been utilized to screen the potential vat dye candidates for generic PP coloration. Experimental K/S results have exhibited good correlation with the predicted mixing energy of acid leuco vat dyes-PP fiber and the calculated dyes' SP's. The low SP/mixing energy acid leuco vat dyes (e. g., C. I. Vat Red 1) have shown better color-yield/fastness properties than the high SP/mixing energy vat dyes (e. g., C. I. Vat Brown 1), exhibiting that increasing difference of SP between the vat dye and the PP fiber, coupled with a higher mixing energy of dye-PP blend, resulted in decreased interactions between the two. For example, C. I. Vat Brown 1 with its high SP and calculated mixing energy with PP gave least color yield than the certified vat dyes, all with lower SP's and mixing energies. Cross-section micrographs of the dyed fibers revealed the absence of "ring-dyeing". Experimentally determined kinetic parameters such as affinity of dyeing and heat of dyeing quantified the presence of interaction between acid leuco vat dyes and PP fiber.

In addition to the traditional absorbance experiments, based on diffuse and specular reflectance of dye impregnated thin films and on the desorption of dye molecules from the photoanodes {{by means of a}} basic solution, an alternative In-Situ solution depletion measurement, which enables fast and <b>continuous</b> evaluation of <b>dye</b> uptake, has been employed. Two different nanostructured semiconducting oxide films (mesoporous TiO 2 and sponge-like ZnO) and two different dyes, the traditional Ruthenizer 535 -bisTBA (N 719) and a newly introduced metal-free organic dye based on a hemi-squaraine molecule (CT 1), have been analyzed. DSSCs have been fabricated with the dye-impregnated photoanodes using a customized microfluidic architecture. The dye adsorption results are discussed and correlated to the obtained DSSC electrical performances such as photovoltaic conversion efficiencies and Incident Photon-to-electron Conversion Efficiency (IPCE) spectra.

40|$|While {{fluorescent}} analogues of {{the canonical}} nucleobases {{have proven to}} be highly valuable in a large number of applications, up until today, fluorescent DNA base analogues remain virtually inapplicable for single-molecule fluorescence experiments which require extremely bright and photostable dyes. Insight into the photodegradation processes of these fluorophores is thus a key step in the <b>continuous</b> development towards <b>dyes</b> with improved performances. Here, we show that the commercially available fluorescent nucleobase analogue tC under intense long-term illumination and in the presence of O- 2 is degraded to form a single photoreaction product which we suggest to be the sulfoxide form of tC. The photoproduct is characterized by a blue-shifted absorption and a less intense fluorescence compared to that of tC. Interestingly, when tC is positioned inside double-stranded DNA this photodriven conversion of tC to its photoproduct greatly reduces the duplex stability of the overall double helix in which the probe is positioned. Since tC can be excited selectively at 400 nm, well outside the absorption band of the natural DNA bases, this observation points towards the application of tC as a general light-triggered switch of DNA duplex stability...|$|R

40|$|Superior to {{supersonic}} jet experiments where rotational {{temperatures of}} 1 K are easily reached while vibrational temperatures of 10 K may persist, superfluid helium droplets incorporating a molecule cool all {{degrees of freedom}} of the dopant to the same temperature safe in the sub-Kelvin regime at 0. 37 K. Due to the dissipative medium, simplification of electronic spectra is achieved since only very few rotational levels remain occupied. Though, comparison with isolated molecules in supersonic jet expansions revealed significant deviations concerning electronic spectra of certain molecules. Phenomena such as line splitting, phonon wings (PWs) or dramatic line broadening clearly point to a not yet entirely understood involvement of guest-host interactions. In general, mechanisms that may cause line broadening in electronic spectra either depend on damping of nuclear rearrangement or disturbance of the electronic excitation process. Phthalocyanines and porphyrins are known to possess a rather rigid molecular backbone. Therefore, interaction of the molecule with the superfluid helium droplet can be assumed to be mainly mediated via differing substituent groups. Since a considerably large variety of substituted compounds is commercially available and the electronic excitation spectra fit well into the spectral range covered by the <b>continuous</b> wave <b>dye</b> laser {{used for this study}} several porphyrin and phthalocyanine derivatives substituted with different types and numbers of alkyl and aryl groups were chosen as molecular probes. This enables enquiring for a direct or indirect effect of low energy vibrational modes on line widths in electronic spectra of organic molecules doped into superfluid helium droplets. Recording fluorescence excitation and dispersed emission spectra revealed exclusively sharp transitions for all species. Together with an intensity peaking at the electronic origin, the spectra indicate that the molecular structure remains unchanged upon electronic excitation. Although, PWs dominating in their intensities over the zero phonon lines (ZPLs), even below any saturation limit, were observed when probing tetra-methyl-porphyrin (TMP) with a pulsed dye laser. This is an indication for a displacement of the equilibrium configuration of the solvation complex in S 0 and S 1. This means considerable rearrangement of the helium atoms surrounding the molecular dopant. But, considering experiments performed with the <b>continuous</b> wave <b>dye</b> laser, which provides a photon flux that is by about 5 to 6 orders of magnitude lower than for pulsed dye lasers, the ZPL was the dominating spectral feature of the electronic origin for all molecules within this study with the exception of TMP. The fluorescence excitation spectrum of the latter was found to consist of contributions from two species. This spectroscopic finding was also confirmed by an HPLC analysis of our TMP sample. The electronic origin of one compound within the TMP sample not only presented with a spectral shape that was never observed before in electronic spectra of organic molecules in superfluid helium droplets: a series of several sharp lines separated by about 0. 3 cm- 1 from each other was observed with increasing intensity from the first to the fourth and finally merging of the sharp lines into a broad unstructured band. It also exhibited a PW that was at least of comparable intensity to the ZPL even at the low photon flux provided by the <b>continuous</b> wave <b>dye</b> laser. Even though sharp lines have been observed in the electronic spectra for all molecules investigated for this study, a result that is generally expected considering the cold helium droplet environment, several molecules in recent studies exhibited significant line broadening in their electronic spectra when doped into superfluid helium droplets. At this, large amplitude motions were possible via e. g. methyl or phenyl groups for some species and therefore a correlation of line broadening and intramolecular nuclear rearrangement seemed to be a plausible explanation. Taking into account an even larger set of experimental data, a recent attempt to interpret those findings proposes that broadening is a result of intramolecular charge redistribution initiated by the electronic excitation. Precisely, a change of the molecule's electrostatic moments, primarily and most effectively, a change of the molecular dipole moment regarding both magnitude and orientation, was identified as the main contribution for line broadening effects. The ability of a molecule to allow for large amplitude motions is thus not mandatory for line broadening since rigid molecules like e. g. 3 -hydroxyavone or fluorazene exhibit broadened spectra as well. Furthermore, not all molecules with substituents that can undergo torsional motions or the like show line broadening in their electronic spectra, e. g. the molecules investigated for this study. For the latter, the existence of a molecular dipole moment is excluded due to an inversion center of the symmetrically substituted compounds. Therefore, experiments performed for this study support the model that line broadening in electronic spectra of organic molecules in superfluid helium droplets is caused by intramolecular charge redistribution following the electronic excitation. Hence, the solvation shell of helium atoms tightly adapted to the guest molecule needs to change its configuration in order to adapt to the new charge density distribution. This adaption procedure obviously manifests in broadened transitions since the potential energy curves of S 0 and S 1 are considerably shifted against each other. Apart from the sharp lines presented in their fluorescence excitation spectra, the phthalocyanine derivatives investigated for this study, namely chloro-aluminium-phthalocyanine (AlClPc) and tetra-tertbutyl-phthalocyanine (TTBPc), exhibited more than one emission spectrum. Replacing one helium atom of the molecule's solvation shell by another rare gas atom like e. g. argon, i. e. forming AlClPc-Ar 1 van der Waals clusters within the superfluid helium droplet, one aims to gain further insight into the dynamics of solvation structures next to the guest molecule. Recording dispersed emission spectra of those complexes revealed again more than one emission spectrum. Yet, vibronic transitions were not just split into two spectra but multiplets consisting of three and more signals and explained with a multiple level system representing different solvation configurations of the first helium layer around the dopant. Within the course of this study also a replacement of the formerly used flow-through cryostat of the continuous droplet machine by a closed-cycle cryostat unit was performed. This made an adjustment procedure of the nozzle unit to the droplet beam axis defined by the openings of the skimmer and the pick-up cell necessary. It revealed that the helium droplets can be reflected into the detection chamber via collision with the skimmer if the nozzle is not adjusted to the actual droplet beam axis. ...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundLymphoscintigraphy {{has largely}} been {{performed}} to diagnose lymphedema. It is, however a time-consuming and expensive technique, {{which has not been}} covered by Japanese medical insurance since the year 2002. In this report we introduce a new imaging technique of fluorescent lymphography to diagnose lymphedema. MethodsFluorescence images of subcutaneous lymphatic drainage after subcutaneous injection of indocyanine green (ICG) at the foot were obtained using a newly developed near-infrared camera system. ICG fluorescent lymphography was performed in 12 patients with secondary lymphedema and 10 healthy volunteers. The 12 patients were diagnosed with secondary lymphedema according to the medical history and lymphoscintigram, of which 11 had a history of hysterectomy with extended lymph node dissection and local radiation therapy for uterine cancer. Lymphedema developed in one patient after femorotibial artery bypass for peripheral artery occlusive disease. ResultsFour abnormal fluorescent patterns of the lymph drainage were observed in lymphedema: dermal backflow (an abnormal filling of the lymph capillaries), extended fluorescent signal at the dorsum and plantar region of the foot, dilated lymph channels with proximal obliteration, and diffuse glittering of fluorescent signals with scattered twinkling of the <b>dye.</b> <b>Continuous</b> lymph channels from the injection site of the foot to the groin were observed along the medial aspect of thigh in healthy subjects. ConclusionICG fluorescence lymphography is safe, simple, and minimally invasive. The device is portable and easy to use. The technique may be useful in clinical practice to identify presence of lymphatic disorder...|$|R
40|$|The flow {{of fluids}} through packed beds {{is a field}} of science and {{technology}} which has developed rapidly during recent years. Major developments have occurred in the area commonly referred to as diffusional operations; in fact, there is hardly a chemical process today which does not ultimately involve one or several steps that are commonly included in this area. Although no general theory exists, knowledge of turbulent diffusion in packed beds is of interest in the technology of catalytic reactors, packed tube heaters, and absorbers. In this work, mass transfer rates in the radial direction in the dispersed phase for two phase flow in a packed bed were experimentally determined. A column packed with half-inch graphite Raschig rings in which air and water were contacted counter-currently was used. The column was operated so that the water was the dispersed phase with which a <b>continuous</b> “point source” <b>dye</b> stream was injected {{at the top of the}} packing. Capillary tubes placed at a cross-section within the bed enabled liquid phase samples to be withdrawn from various radial positions. These samples were analyzed for dye concentration with a spectrophotometer. From the resulting radial concentration profile a pseudo diffusion coefficient is presented in terms of the dimensionless group commonly called the modified Peclet number Pe = where dp is the particle diameter and u is the mean point condition velocity in the axial direction. Results indicate that an increase in the Reynolds number of either phase will improve mixing in the radial direction in the dispersed phase as evidenced by a decrease in the Peclet number. A satisfactory correlation of this behavior over the range of variables studied is presented along with suggestions for further work in this area Advisor: Richard E. Gilber...|$|R
