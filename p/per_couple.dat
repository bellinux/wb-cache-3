50|$|The heavier the {{reciprocating}} machinery, {{the greater}} these forces are, {{and the greater}} a problem this becomes. Except {{for a short period}} early in the twentieth century when balanced compound locomotives were tried, American railroads were not interested in locomotives with inside cylinders, so the problem of balance could not be solved by adding more cylinders <b>per</b> <b>coupled</b> wheel set. As locomotives got larger and more powerful, their reciprocating machinery had to get stronger and thus heavier, and thus the problems posed by imbalance and hammer blow became more severe. Higher speeds also increased unbalanced forces which rise with the square of the wheel rotational speed.|$|R
25|$|A Cochrane {{systematic}} review updated in 2012 showed that blastocyst stage transfer {{is more effective}} than cleavage (day 2 or 3) stage transfer in assisted reproductive technologies. It showed a small improvement in live birth rate <b>per</b> <b>couple</b> for blastocyst transfers. This would mean that for a typical rate of 31% in clinics that use early cleavage stage cycles, the rate would increase to 32% to 42% live births if clinics used blastocyst transfer.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{traditional}} {{attitudes toward the}} family have survived without being questioned. It is taken for granted that everyone should marry, and marriage remains part {{of the definition of}} normal adult status. Marriage is expected to be permanent. That marriage requires a woman to move into her husband's family and to become a daughter-in-law as well as a wife is still largely accepted. The norm of patrilineal descent and the assumption that it is sons who bear the primary responsibility for their aged parents remain. The party and government have devoted great effort to controlling the number of births and have attempted {{to limit the number of}} children <b>per</b> <b>couple.</b> But the authorities have not attempted to control population growth by suggesting that some people should not marry at all.|$|E

40|$|Theoretical free-energy {{coupling}} {{systems in}} which the free energy coupling intermediate (e. g., the proton) occurs only in small numbers of molecules <b>per</b> <b>coupling</b> unit are shown to exhibit a number of peculiar properties: (i) the reactions involving the intermediates do not follow conventional kinetic (or nonequilibrium thermodynamic) rate laws {{in terms of the}} average concentration or chemical potential of the intermediate, (ii) the variation of the output reaction rate with the average intermediate concentration (or apparent chemical potential) is not unequivocal but depends on whether the input reaction or the leak is varied to alter that concentration, and (iii) when the apparent free energy contained in the average concentration of the intermediate is compared with the average free energy recovered in the output reaction, apparent violations of the second law of thermodynamics can occur. These phenomena are reminiscent of experimental observations in proton-linked free-energy transducing systems that suggest a more direct coupling between electron transfer chains and H+-ATPases than only through a bulk proton gradient, delta muH. Consequently, the chemiosmotic coupling theory can account for those observations if it limits the number of free energy <b>coupling</b> protons <b>per</b> chemiosmotic <b>coupling</b> unit to small values...|$|R

2500|$|Although {{many critics}} of China's {{reproductive}} restrictions {{approve of the}} policy's abolition, an Amnesty International spokesperson said that the move to the two-child policy would not end forced sterilizations, forced abortions, or government control over birth permits. Others also state that the abolition is {{not a sign of}} the relaxation of authoritarian control in China. A reporter for CNN said, [...] "It was not a sign that the party will suddenly start respecting personal freedoms more than it has in the past. [...] No, this is a case of the party adjusting policy to conditions. ... The new policy, raising the limit to two children <b>per</b> <b>couple,</b> preserves the state's role." [...] The abolition may not achieve a significant benefit, as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation analysis indicates: [...] "Repealing the one-child policy may not spur a huge baby boom, however, in part because fertility rates are believed to be declining even without the policy's enforcement. Previous easings of the one-child policy have spurred fewer births than expected, and many people among China's younger generations see smaller family sizes as ideal." [...] The CNN reporter adds that China's new prosperity is also a factor in the declining birth rate, saying, [...] "Couples naturally decide to have fewer children as they move from the fields into the cities, become more educated, and when women establish careers outside the home." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 2011 {{marked the}} twenty second annual event, which {{originally}} {{was called the}} Concuso Nacional de Baile de Huapango y Reunión de las Huastecas. In this year, {{there were more than}} 400 couples registered in the competition with about 10,000 spectators in attendance, as the event grows each year. The event is held at the Casa de la Cultura (House of Culture), with three categories: children’s (under 12), youth (13 to 17) and adult (over 18). Entrance fee is 100 pesos <b>per</b> <b>couple.</b> Various styles of Huapango dance is presented including hidalguense, poblano, potosino, queretano, tamaulipeco and veracruzano, named after the states of Hidalgo, Puebla, San Luis Potosí, Querétaro, Tamaulipas and Veracruz respectively. It begins on Friday night and concludes on Sunday night. The children’s category is exposition only, with the other two having eliminations. The judging panels are made up of representatives of these states, who qualify technique, dress, projection, coordination and precision. The winners of various categories received between four and six thousand pesos, with the overall winner for each age group receiving between 14,000 and 20,000 pesos. Those couples who have won the grand prize in previous years are not allowed to participate again together. For 2011, the groups presenting live music for the event included Los Hidalguenses, Reales de Colima and Huapangueros Differentes. The event is concurrent with the Fiestas Patronales or feast day of the patron saint of the municipality. This event in 2011 featured popular rock groups such as Pambo Pop-rock and Pega Pega de Emilio Reyna.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to improve the mass rearing technique of Euschistus heros in laboratory. Nymphs and adults were reared at densities 100, 200, 300 and 400 eggs per Petri dish (9 cm diameter), and at 50, 100, 150 and 200 <b>couples</b> <b>per</b> rearing cages (900 mL), respectively. Survival rate of immature stages and survivorship and reproduction of adults were determinated. Survivorship of nymph to adult was the highest (89 %) at density 100 eggs per dish. Adult survivorship was independent of density, and 100 <b>couples</b> <b>per</b> cage were the best to improve quality of the produced progeny. In these conditions, fecundity was 160. 8 ± 9. 28 eggs per female, {{and a total of}} 8, 950 ± 456 eggs per cage per month was produced. Two hundred <b>couples</b> <b>per</b> cage showed a negative effect on reproduction, which decreased to 65 %. With this technique, a colony of 35 cages with 100 <b>couples</b> <b>per</b> cage yields about 313. 3 thousands eggs per month, which is enough to supply the egg parasitoid Telenomus podisi to colonize about 35 ha of soybean field. 200...|$|R
