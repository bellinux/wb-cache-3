Substitution elements Ni, Cr and Nb not only have limited solubility in NaZn 13 -type (1 : 13) phase, but also hinder the <b>peritectoid</b> reaction. Ni element mainly enters into La-rich phase while Cr element mainly concentrates in α-Fe phase, which both have detriment effect on the <b>peritectoid</b> reaction, leading to a large residual of impurity phases after annealing and a decrease of magnetic entropy change. Besides, Ni and Cr participated in <b>peritectoid</b> reaction by entering parent phases but slightly entering 1 : 13 phase, which would cause the disappearance of first order magnetic phase transition. A new phase (Fe,Si) 2 Nb was found when Nb element substitutes Fe in La(Fe,Si) 13, suggesting that Nb does not participate in <b>peritectoid</b> reaction and only exists in (Fe,Si) 2 Nb phase after annealing.

This {{resulting}} phase diagram shows three kinds of peritectic reactions, one eutectic reaction and one <b>peritectoid</b> reaction. The equilibrium solid phases in this diagram are the 2201 (n= 1), 2212 (n= 2), 2223 (n= 3) and (Sr,Ca) CuO 2 (n→∝) phases. The 2201 phase is solid solution which is stable at 1 ≤n≤ 1. 2.

The temperature interval between the peritectic reaction of L + (Sr,Ca) 2 CuO 3 + (Sr,Ca) CuO 2 → 2212 and the eutectic reaction of L → 2201 + 2212 is only about 3 ℃.

Computational systematic search modelling in combination with high resolution synchrotron X-ray powder data yields its crystallographic structure for C 18 and C 16 together with their volume thermal expansion coefficients: 4. 39 ±(1. 94) × 〖 10 〗^(- 4) ˚C- 1 and 4. 17 ±(2. 48) × 〖 10 〗^(- 4) ˚C- 1. Morphological analysis of C 18 crystals reveals a plate-like morphology dominated by the 001 habit plane with smaller side faces (depending upon supersaturation). Analysis of C 18 /C 16 binary phase diagram reveals five single phases (liquid, R 1, Mdcp, Op and T 18) and five three-phase-equilibrium invariants (eutectic and peritectic at high temperature, eutectoid and <b>peritectoid</b> at low temperature). Kinetic studies reveal the crossover behaviour of the R 1 existed in a transient to metastable to stable phase, which the stability is affected by both composition and alkane chain length. Studies of the ternary C 18 /C 16 /kerosene system reveal a variety of different structures with compositions close to that of its pure components forming solid-solution in triclinic structures, whilst high relative fractions result in its formation of multiple phases (triclinic and two higher symmetry structures). Rotator induced crystallisation observed in melt phase crystallisation is also formed in solution crystallisation but only for C 18 /C 16 mixtures with its metastability depending on the composition. Solubility studies reveal the closest to the ideal condition with highest solubility in n-dodecane followed by kerosene and toluene respectively. Calculated activity coefficients reflect the non-identical phase formation in the solution phase with higher deviations for C 18 molar compositions of x= 0. 1, 0. 5 - 0. 7. Solvents type is not found to have any significant effect on its solid for structure behaviour for C 18 /C 16 mixtures. Crystallisation of C 18 /C 16 mixtures for most compositions in the three solvents are found to be mediated by progressive nucleation mechanism. Cases of instantaneous nucleation are also seen in particularly compositions with higher C 18 concentration. Progressive nucleation reveals well correlated with wider metastable zone width and concomitant larger interfacial tension (1. 33 - 1. 64 mJ/m^ 2). Higher solubility is found to accelerate the instantaneous nucleation by increasing effective solute concentration, whilst inhibit the progressive nucleation by causing larger interfacial tension. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{constitution}} of the gold-rich region of the gold—cadmium diagram has been etudied by means of thermal analysis, optical microscopy and Debye-Scherrer X-ray films of high-temperature and quenched specimens. Five phases have been identified, α face-centred cubic, α 2 close-packed hexagonal, β' ordered body-centred cubic {{as well as two}} phases at low temperatures, α 1 face-centred tetragonal and α' face-centred cubic. The liquidus and solidus relationships have been found for the α, α 2 and β-phases by thermal analysis, the results being in good agreement with the X-ray and microscopical results. A eutectic horizontal representing the reaction α 2 + β' ⇌ liquid is found at 626. 5 °C. The β'-phase maximum is only just detectable, rising to 629 °C. From the X-ray evidence a peritectic horizontal, corresponding to the reaction α + liquid ⇌ α 2, is believed to exist between 633 °C and the eutectic temperature; the thermal arrests place it at 627 °C. The α 2 (α 2 + β') and (α 2 + β') β boundaries have been determined microscopically. Only a few experimental points have been obtained for the α + α 2 boundaries but the high-temperature X-ray films indicate that the boundaries of previous workers are in need of revision. The maximum solid solubility of cadmium in gold is 34 atomic % at 620 °C to 630 °C. The β'-phase narrows in composition range as temperature falls. The high-temperature X-ray films showed superlattice lines up to 624 °C and an estimate of the degree of ordering at 620 °C suggests the β-phase to be about 90 % ordered at this temperature. The α 1 -phase at 23 atomic % cadmium is disordered face- centred tetragonal when photographed at elevated temperatures. The absence of superlattice lines is contrary to previous work which describes the unit cell in quenched α 1, specimens as ordered (an anti-phase domain structure based on four fundamental tetragonal cells). It is conjectured that quenched α 1 specimens may be ordered but as temperature is increased the long-range order is broken down, producing small domains each highly ordered. At about 25 atomic % cadmium the structure is face- centred cubic. A new phase α' is proposed at this composition. A tentative diagram of the Au 3 Cd region, linking the four phases α, α 1, α' and α 2 is suggested with <b>peritectoid</b> horizontals at 412 °C and 407 °C. Factors affecting the behaviour of the liquidus and solidus of the gold-cadmium system are revealed by comparing with other systems of copper, silver and gold. The comparisons show the influence of the electron concentration, modified by lattice distortions and the electrochemical factor. The α 2 -phase (close-packed hexagonal) is shown to contain numerous stacking faults; this may be a consequence of the α(face-centred cubic) and α 2 -phases having nearly equal free energies. The occurrence of the 3 / 2 electron compounds in gold is discussed and suggestions are given for their bearing on maximum solid solubilities in gold. </p...|$|E
