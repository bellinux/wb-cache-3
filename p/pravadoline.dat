2500|$|The first {{approach}} to develop cannabinoid antagonists {{in the late}} 1980s was to modify the structure of THC but the results were disappointing. In the early 1990s new family of cannabinoid agonists was discovered from the NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) drug <b>pravadoline</b> {{which led to the}} discovery of aminoalkyl indole antagonists with some but limited success. [...] As the search based on the structure of agonists was disappointing it was no surprise that the first potent and selective cannabinoid antagonist belonged to an entirely new chemical family. In 1994 the first selective cannabinoid antagonist, [...] SR141716 (rimonabant), was introduced by Sanofi belonging to a family of 1,5-diarylpyrazoles.|$|E
50|$|The antinociceptive {{activity}} of <b>pravadoline</b> cannot {{be explained by}} an opioid mechanism, because pravadoline-induced antinociception was not antagonized by naloxone (1 mg/kg, s.c.) and <b>pravadoline</b> did not bind to the opioid receptors at concentrations up to 10 μM.|$|E
50|$|However, <b>pravadoline</b> {{was found}} to exhibit {{unexpectedly}} strong analgesic effects, which appeared at doses ten times smaller than the effective anti-inflammatory dose and so could not be explained by its action as a COX inhibitor. These effects were not blocked by opioid antagonists such as naloxone, and it was eventually discovered that <b>pravadoline</b> represented the first compound from a novel class of cannabinoid agonists, the aminoalkylindoles.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pravadoline</b> {{was never}} {{developed}} {{for use as}} an analgesic, partly due to toxicity concerns (although these were later {{shown to be a}} result of the salt form that the drug had been prepared in rather than from the <b>pravadoline</b> itself), however the discovery of cannabinoid activity in this structurally novel family of drugs led to the discovery of several new cannabinoid agonists, including the drug WIN 55,212-2, which is now widely used in scientific research.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pravadoline</b> (WIN 48,098) is an {{antiinflammatory}} and {{analgesic drug}} with an IC50 of 4.9 µM and a Ki of 2511 nM at CB1, related in structure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammtory drugs (NSAIDs) such as indometacin. It {{was developed in}} the 1980s as a new antiinflammatory and prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, acting through inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX).|$|E

5000|$|JWH-007 is an {{analgesic}} chemical {{from the}} naphthoylindole family, which {{acts as a}} cannabinoid agonist at both the CB1 and CB2 receptors. It was the most active of {{the first group of}} N-alkyl naphoylindoles discovered by the team led by John W Huffman, several years after the family was initially described with the discovery of the N-morpholinylethyl compounds <b>pravadoline</b> (WIN 48,098), WIN 55,225 (JWH-200) and WIN 55,212-2 by the Sterling Winthrop group. Several other N-alkyl substituents were found to be active by Huffman's team including the n-butyl, n-hexyl, 2-heptyl and cyclohexylethyl groups, but it was subsequently determined that the 2-methyl group on the indole ring is not required for CB1 binding, and tends to increase affinity for CB2 instead. [...] Consequently, the 2-desmethyl derivative of JWH-007, JWH-018 has slightly higher binding affinity for CB1, with an optimum binding of 9.00nM at CB1 and 2.94nM at CB2, and JWH-007 displayed optimum binding of 9.50nM at CB1 and 2.94nM at CB2.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pravadoline</b> {{is a novel}} cyclooxygenase-inhibiting {{analgesic}} with a preclinical {{profile of}} activity in vivo clearly distinct from that of other cyclooxygenase inhibitors. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to assess the possibility that <b>pravadoline</b> possesses pharmacologic actions in addition to inhibition of cyclooxygen-ase. The data demonstrate that <b>pravadoline</b> inhibits neuronally stimulated contractions of the guinea pig ileum and mouse vas deferens preparations. These actions of <b>pravadoline</b> are not shared by known cyclooxygenase inhibitors, but are mimicked by close structural analogs of <b>pravadoline</b> devoid of the ability to inhibit prostaglandin formation. Some structural analogs were inhibitory also in the rat vas deferens preparation. The inhibitory effects of <b>pravadoline</b> and a representative noncyclooxygenase-inhibiting analog in isolated tissue preparations are not mediate...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} antitumor {{activity of}} mixed CB 1 /CB 2 cannabinoid receptor agonists, {{such as the}} aminoalkylindole WIN 55, 212 - 2 (WIN 2), has been extensively studied, but little information is available as to their potential interaction with conventional cancer therapies, such as ionizing radiation (IR). In the present work, we investigated the effects of WIN 2 on the antiproliferative effects of radiation in human (MCF- 7 and MDA-MB- 231) and murine (4 T 1) breast cancer cells, {{as well as an}} immortalized human breast epithelial cell line (MCF- 10 A). WIN 2 or radiation alone inhibited breast tumor growth, while the combination of WIN 2 and radiation was more effective than either agent alone in breast cancer cells. WIN 2 showed lower potency in MCF- 10 A cells than MCF- 7 cells, but was still able to augment the effects of radiation at higher doses. The stereoisomer of WIN 2, WIN 55, 212 - 3 (WIN 3) failed to inhibit growth or potentiate the growth-inhibitory effects of radiation, indicating stereospecificity in all cell lines tested. The combination of WIN 2 and IR was examined in vivo but the results were inconclusive. Interestingly, while other aminoalkylindoles, <b>pravadoline</b> and JWH- 015, enhanced the antiproliferative effects of radiation, {{this was not the case}} for other synthetic cannabinoids (i. e., nabilone, CP 55, 940 and methanandamide) or phytocannabinoids (i. e., ∆ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol). The antiproliferative actions of WIN 2 were not ameliorated by CB 1, CB 2, TRPV 1, or PPAR receptor antagonists, suggesting the possibility of a novel site of action. Studies utilizing sphingosine- 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) agonists and estradiol suggest that WIN 2 interferes with S 1 P signaling in cell proliferation, but agonist stimulated [³⁵S]GTPγS binding assays show that this antagonism is not occurring at the level of S 1 P receptors. In addition, WIN 2 did not alter radiation-induced DNA damage or the rate of DNA repair based on γH 2 AX staining. Treatment with WIN 2 and radiation promoted both autophagy and senescence, but not apoptosis or necrosis. Time course studies combined with senescence and cell death data suggest that radiation-induced senescence, while WIN 2 induced classical growth arrest and the WIN 2 /IR combination produced parallel mechanisms of both senescent growth arrest and classical growth arrest. Taken together, these findings raise the possibility that aminoalkylindole compounds targeting a novel site of action represents a potential strategy to augment the effectiveness of radiation treatment in breast cancer...|$|E
