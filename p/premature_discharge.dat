40|$|The Occupational Therapy {{course of}} the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM) was created in 2009. Since then, its faculty has sought the {{inclusion}} in the three lines (primary, secondary and tertiary) of health care services. Within the university premises, there is a University Hospital (HUSM) that offers services in several complexities. The Pediatric Clinic, which holds the Monitoring Program of <b>Premature</b> Infants <b>discharged</b> from Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU), is among them. This service was created at government level and implemented in hospitals that are considered regional references to monitor <b>premature</b> infants <b>discharged</b> from NICUs. The {{significant increase in the}} number of infants who survive prematurity initiated the need for continuous monitoring, because infants are still considered at risk even after hospital discharge.

40|$|The {{tasks and}} {{capabilities}} of the Swedish Armed Forces are changing to meet new threats all around the world. With the sharp decrease in number of enlisted soldiers, selection {{is more important than}} ever. It is also important to prevent soldiers from leaving military service prematurely i. e. from being discharged. The present work has sought to deepen our knowledge in this important field. The overall aim of the work presented in this thesis was to identify risk factors and to describe and analyze the influence of preventive interventions on <b>premature</b> <b>discharge</b> from military service. This was to be achieved by evaluating both a test for selection to physically demanding service and screening tests for identifying risk factors for discharge present at the start of army conscript service. Finally, a specially-tailored comprehensive intervention programme was implemented. Male conscripts (n= 1807) from different army units participated in the four studies during their military service. The investigations were applied within {{the first week of the}} conscripts service. Cases for <b>premature</b> <b>discharge</b> were recorded during service. The lower-limb functional capacity test, the ranger test, was evaluated in a ranger unit. A musculoskeletal screening protocol (MSP) with the main purpose of identifying personnel at risk of <b>premature</b> <b>discharge</b> was developed. The MSP comprised a questionnaire, a lower-limb-loading test with pain-intensity ratings, assessment of passive range of motion, and muscular endurance tests. The comprehensive intervention was implemented in an artillery unit, a ranger unit and an engineer unit. The intervention comprised a course for officers, the MSP followed by early rehabilitation, organised, systematic co-operation between officers and physiotherapist, and physical training programmes. The ranger test had high discriminating ability and predictive value for <b>premature</b> <b>discharge</b> caused by knee or back problems during strenuous military ranger training. The set of four lower-limb-loading tests was reliable and valid in detecting knee pain. Musculoskeletal complaints or injuries current at the start of the training were common (33 - 41 %) and independently and significantly associated with <b>premature</b> <b>discharge.</b> Being physically inactive, exposed to high physical load during the first three months of service, perceiving poor mental health, being mentally unprepared or smoking were also predictors of <b>premature</b> <b>discharge.</b> The discharge rate was lower in all three units after the intervention programme had been implemented compared to the previous year. In conclusion, different risk factors for <b>premature</b> <b>discharge</b> can be identified at the time conscript service begins. A supplemented selection procedure during enrolment for ranger conscripts was important for conscripts who would be highly loaded. The ranger test could be a supplement in the selection of applicants for ranger service, where a minimally acceptable performance standard is suggested. Fewer prematurely discharged conscripts, in comparison with historical data, indicates that the present intervention programme implemented in three army units was effective. The findings provide useful information on potential risk factors, and this highlights the need for improved pre-enlistment examination and early preventive strategies...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{matching}} {{of critical}} care service supply with demand is fundamental for the efficient delivery of advanced life support to patients in urgent need. Mismatch in this supply/demand relationship contributes to “intensive care unit (ICU) capacity strain, ” {{defined as a}} time-varying disruption {{in the ability of}} an ICU to provide well-timed and high-quality intensive care support to any and all patients who are or may become critically ill. ICU capacity strain leads to suboptimal quality of care and may directly contribute to heightened risk of adverse events, <b>premature</b> <b>discharges,</b> unplanned readmissions, and avoidable death. Unrelenting strain on ICU capacity contributes to inefficient health resource utilization and may negatively impact the satisfaction of patients, their families, and frontline providers. It is unknown how to optimally quantify the instantaneous and temporal “stress ” an ICU experiences due to capacity strain.

They were tracked over a 12  month period to determine those who were prematurely discharged.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Excess training costs as a result of <b>premature</b> <b>discharge.</b>  RESULTS— In this 12  month period, 14. 0 % of those entering the US Air Force were discharged at a one year follow up. In both univariate and multivariate models, the best single predictor of early discharge was smoking status. Overall, 11. 8 % of non-smokers versus 19. 4 % of smokers were prematurely discharged (relative risk 1. 795).  CONCLUSIONS—Using US Department of Defense data on the cost of military training, recruits who smoke in the US Air Force are associated with $ 18 million per year in excess training costs. Applied to all service branches, smoking status, which represents a constellation of underlying behaviours and attitudes that can contribute to early discharge, is associated with over $ 130 million per year in excess training costs.    Keywords: military; smoking ban; training cost...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Decision {{making is}} one of the most {{critical}} activities in Intensive Care Units (ICU). Moreover, it is extremely difficult for health professionals to interpret in real time all the available data. In order to improve the decision process, classification models have been developed to predict patient’s readmission in ICU. Knowing the probability of readmission in advance will allow for a more efficient planning of discharge. Consequently, the use of these models results in a lower rates of readmission and a cost reduction, usually associated with <b>premature</b> <b>discharges</b> and unplanned readmissions. In this work was followed a numerical index, called Stability and Workload Index for Transfer (SWIFT). The data used to induce the classification models are from ICU of Centro Hospitalar do Porto, Portugal. The results obtained so far, in terms of accuracy, were very satisfactory (98. 91 %). Those results were achieved through the use of Naïve Bayes technique. The models will allow health professionals to have a better perception on patient’s future condition in the moment of the hospital discharge. Therefore it will be possible to know the probability of a patient being readmitted into the ICU...|$|R

40|$|Outstanding ThesisApproved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis study assessed {{the value of}} a specific set of client variables in predicting treatment phase retention and overall program completion of an intervention treatment program for homeless veterans. Treatment programs can improve the lives of homeless individuals, but many participants leave prematurely. Certain characteristics, which are evident upon admission, may help to identify those veterans at greater risk of early discharge and program failure. Spanning three years (20092011), the records of 680 unique clients from a homeless veterans program were reviewed. Logistic regression models yielded significant association between treatment completion, graduation, and certain observable client characteristics. Ultimately, information regarding a clients mental health, chronic health, and the clients immediate prior residence before admission to the Veteran Rehabilitation Center program proved to be significant independent predictors of <b>premature</b> <b>discharge</b> from treatment. From the significant covariates for the treatment model, a simple, scoring-scheme heuristic was developed to enable treatment providers to expeditiously and accurately assess relative risk of <b>premature</b> <b>discharge</b> among a cohort of veteran clients. Using demographic information from three simple questions, the scoring scheme has a 98. 3 % correlation to the theoretical probability of failure from treatment and gives providers a simple and accurate way to identify those at greater risk of early exit. These results can inform targeted intervention strategies to maximize program effectiveness and efficiency. They provide a decision support tool to help high-risk veterans remain engaged in treatment, attain treatment goals, graduate, and fully prepare them to reintegrate into a sober, self-sustaining lifestyle.

40|$|In {{this study}} we explore a model to {{optimize}} the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) discharging decisions prior to service completion {{as a result of}} capacity-constrained situation under uncertainty. Discharging prior to service completion, which is called demand-driven <b>discharge</b> or <b>premature</b> <b>discharging,</b> increases the chance that a patient to be readmitted to the ICU in the near future. Since readmission imposes an additional load on ICUs, the cost of demand-driven discharge is pertained to the surge of readmission chance and the length of stay (LOS) in the ICU after readmission. Hence, the problem is how to select a current patient in the ICU for demand-driven discharge to accommodate a new critically ill patient. In essence, the problem is formulated as a stochastic dynamic programming model. However, even in the deterministic form i. e. knowing the arrival and treatment times in advance, solving the dynamic programming model is almost unaffordable for a sizable problem. This is illustrated by formulating the problem by an integer programming model. The uncertainties and difficulties in the problem are convincing reasons to use the optimization-simulation approach. Thus, using simulations, we evaluate various scenarios by considering Weibull distribution for the LOS. While it is known that selecting a patient with the lowest readmission risk is optimum under certain conditions and supposing a memory-less distribution for LOS; we remark that when LOS is non-memory-less, considering readmission risk and remaining LOS rather than just readmission risk leads to better results...|$|R

40|$|The overall aim of {{the present}} thesis was to study factors related to {{transfers}} of older people between nursing homes, emergency department and hospital care. The thesis was based on four studies and used three methods: focus group discussions, structured review of electronic healthcare records, semi-structured interviews with registered nurses and general practitioners. Study I: nursing home nurses {{found it difficult to}} decide whether older residents should be referred to hospital from the nursing home. Hospital registered nurses reported often trying to stop <b>premature</b> <b>discharges</b> or having to carry out the discharge although it had not been fully prepared. Study II: transfer rate to ED was 594 over 9 months among a total of 431 residents (M 1. 37 each). 25 % were caused by falls and/or injuries, 63 % resulted in hospitalization (M 7. 12 days). The transfer rate was 0. 00 - 1. 03 transfers/bed; it was higher for private for-profit providers than for public/private non-profit providers. Study III: nursing homes with high transfer rates had fewer updated advance care plans than did nursing homes with lower transfer rates. More nurses from nursing homes with low transfer rates had a specialist education and training in dementia care and had worked longer in eldercare. Study IV: general practitioners perceived registered nurses’ continuity, competence and collaboration with family members as important to quality of care in nursing homes; inadequate staffing, lack of medical equipment and less-than-optimal IT systems for electronic healthcare records are impediments to patient safety. The findings indicate that organizational factors could explain differences in transfer rates between nursing homes. The studies highlight the importance of advance care planning together with residents and family members in facilitating future medical decisions. Registered nurses’ continuity and competence are perceived as crucial to quality of care. To meet increasing demands for more complex medical treatment at nursing homes and to provide high-quality palliative care several changes should be made: Nursing homes should be equipped with suitable medical equipment and registered nurse staff should be matched accordingly; importantly, registered nurses and general practitioners should be able to access each other’s healthcare record systems...|$|R
