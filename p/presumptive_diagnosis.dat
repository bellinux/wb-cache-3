5|$|The first clue to a {{diagnosis}} of AML is typically an abnormal result on a complete blood count. While an excess of abnormal white blood cells (leukocytosis) is a common finding with the leukemia, and leukemic blasts are sometimes seen, AML can also present with isolated decreases in platelets, red blood cells, or even with a low {{white blood cell count}} (leukopenia). While a <b>presumptive</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of AML can be made by examination of the peripheral blood smear when there are circulating leukemic blasts, a definitive diagnosis usually requires an adequate bone marrow aspiration and biopsy as well as ruling out pernicious anemia (Vitamin B12 deficiency), folic acid deficiency and copper deficiency.|$|E

40|$|A very rare, purely intradural, spinal, extramedullary {{cavernous}} hemangioma was fortunately {{discovered in}} a 56 years old woman, presenting with bilateral brachial paresthesia. Using conventional spin-echo T 1 proton density, T 2 -weighted magnetic resonance and gadolinium images an intradural spinal T 4 -T 5, an extramedullary cavernous hemangioma was discovered. The patient underwent surgery, with laminectomy and microsurgical resection followed by an uneventful postoperative clinical course. Similar as in cerebral locations a mixed signal intensity in all sequences on magnetic resonance images might be indicative of cavernous hemangioma, rendering a <b>presumptive</b> preoperative <b>diagnosis</b> of the lesion and surgical planning for a good microsurgical resection...|$|R

50|$|A <b>presumptive</b> <b>diagnosis</b> may {{be based}} on {{clinical}} signs. For definitive diagnosis the virus or viral antigens must be demonstrated in the affected tissue(s). Diagnostic techniques used are virus neutralisation, ELISA, immunofluorescence and RT-PCR.|$|E
50|$|More commonly, a <b>presumptive</b> <b>diagnosis</b> is made {{based on}} {{clinical}} signs {{and evaluation of}} abdominal or chest fluid, if available. Fluid caused by FIP tends to be yellow in color and have elevated protein levels. Blood tests can also be performed to bolster a <b>presumptive</b> <b>diagnosis</b> by looking for coronavirus antibodies and elevated protein. Coronavirus titres are NOT considered diagnostic {{in and of themselves}} due to the ubiquity of FeCoV, but may be used in conjunction with clinical symptoms to make an FIP diagnosis. It {{is important to note that}} cats with higher titres of FCoV are no more likely to develop FIP than those with lower titres.|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of renin-secreting juxtaglomerular cell tumor which {{developed}} in a hypertensive 47 -yr-old Korean man. <b>Presumptive</b> clinical <b>diagnosis</b> was made before surgery based on {{the high level of}} plasma renin and the radiologic evidence of renal mass. Grossly, a round, bulging, well-encapsulated mass of 3 x 3 cm was located in the mid-portion of the right kidney. On microscopic examination, the tumor was composed of ovoid to polyhedral cells with bland nuclei, indistinct nucleoli and light eosinophilic cytoplasm. The immunostaining for renin showed strong positivity in the cytoplasm of tumor cells. The characteristic rhomboid shaped renin protogranules were observed in ultrastructural analysis...|$|R
40|$|During a 2 ½-year period, in a 360 -bed general hospital, {{three cases}} of {{pulmonary}} actinomycosis were encountered in men aged 38, 47 and 49 years. In each instance the symptoms, signs and radiological and laboratory findings were such as {{to warrant a}} <b>presumptive</b> clinical <b>diagnosis</b> of bronchogenic carcinoma. Thoracotomy was performed in each case. This experience suggests that a definitive clinical diagnosis of bronchogenic carcinoma should not be made without histological evidence. Furthermore, such individuals should {{have the benefit of}} exploratory thoracotomy on the off-chance that the pulmonary lesion may be benign and amenable to treatment. Above all it should be remembered that pulmonary actinomycosis can simulate bronchogenic carcinoma to a marked degree...|$|R
40|$|In 44 {{consecutive}} patients 46 {{episodes of}} genital ulceration were studied. The <b>presumptive</b> clinical <b>diagnosis</b> was evaluated by extensive microbiological investigations. In 15 (33 %) episodes the clinical diagnosis did not {{accord with the}} microbiological one. Chancroidal lesions were most commonly found to have other microbiological aetiology. Secondary invasion of treponemal or viral lesions by other bacterial species (mostly anaerobes or pyogenic cocci) or genital pyodermia were the cause of confusion in six of nine cases of chancroid. In the other three a ducreyilike bacterium was found. Direct Gram staining of ulcer material did not help the diagnosis of chancroid.

50|$|A <b>presumptive</b> <b>diagnosis</b> {{of acute}} TSV {{infection}} {{can be established}} {{by the presence of}} dead or dying shrimp in cast nets used for routine evaluation. Predatory birds are attracted to diseased ponds and feed heavily on the dying shrimp. The unique signs of infection caused by TS, such as the cuticular melanized spots, can provide a strong <b>presumptive</b> <b>diagnosis,</b> but care must be taken as these can be confused with other diseases, such as bacterial shell disease. In general pathognomonic histopathological lesions are the first step in confirmatory diagnosis. Discrete foci of pyknotic and karyorhectic nuclei and inflammation are seen within the cuticular tissues. The lymphoid organ might display spheroids, but is otherwise unremarkable.|$|E
40|$|The <b>presumptive</b> {{laboratory}} <b>diagnosis</b> of Clostridium difficile {{infection is}} achieved by {{the means of the}} detection of a common antigen (glutamate dehydrogenase, GDH) in stool, then confirming the positives either by the detection of toxins A and B or by a molecular test for the detection of pathogenicity locus, encoding for the two toxins and for the binary toxin. A fully automated chemiluminescence system for the GDH antigen (LIAISON® C. difficile GDH) and for the detection of toxins A and B (LIAISON® C. difficile Toxin A and B) (DiaSorin, Gerenzano, Italy) allows for the performance of these tests on large numbers of samples in a short time, ensuring the traceability of the data...|$|R
40|$|Case report: We {{present a}} case of a 14 -year-old girl with a 3 -week history of severe {{progressive}} headache and intermittent vomiting.

40|$|Criteria for the {{non-invasive}} diagnosis of lymphocytic hypophysitis (LyHy) {{and the results}} of the first prospective trial of high dose methylprednisolone pulse therapy (HDMPT) in nine patients are presented. In three patients, the diagnosis was established histologically, and in the others by clinical and endocrinological assessment, MRI, CSF examination, and measurement of thyroglobulin autoantibody concentration. After HDMPT, adenopituitary function improved in four of the nine patients and diabetes insipidus ceased or improved in all four concerned patients. The MRI findings improved in seven patients. LyHy has to be considered in the differential diagnosis of sellar lesions. The <b>presumptive</b> non-invasive <b>diagnosis</b> of LyHy seems possible in a high proportion of patients. HDMPT may result in the improvement of clinical, endocrinological, and MRI findings. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{areas such}} as eastern Indonesia where both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax occur, rapid antigen {{detection}} tests for malaria {{need to be able}} to detect both species. We evaluated the new combined P. falciparum-P. vivax immunochromatographic test (ICT Malaria P. f/P. v.) in Radamata Primary Health Centre, Sumba, Indonesia, from February to May 1998 with 560 symptomatic adults and children with a <b>presumptive</b> clinical <b>diagnosis</b> of malaria. Blinded microscopy was used as the “gold standard,” with all discordant and 20 % of concordant results cross-checked blindly. Only 50 % of those with a <b>presumptive</b> clinical <b>diagnosis</b> of malaria were parasitemic. The ICT Malaria P. f/P. v immunochromatographic test was sensitive (95. 5 %) and specific (89. 8 %) for the diagnosis of falciparum malaria, with a positive predictive value (PPV) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 88. 1 and 96. 2 %, respectively. HRP 2 and panmalarial antigen line intensities were associated with parasitemia density for both species. Although the specificity and NPV for the diagnosis of vivax malaria were 94. 8 and 98. 2 %, respectively, the overall sensitivity (75 %) and PPV (50 %) for the diagnosis of vivax malaria were less than the desirable levels. The sensitivity for the diagnosis of P. vivax malaria was 96 % with parasitemias of > 500 /μl but only 29 % with parasitemias of < 500 /μl. Nevertheless, compared with the test with HRP 2 alone, use of the combined antigen detection test would reduce the rate of undertreatment from 14. 7 to 3. 6 % for microscopy-positive patients, and this would be at the expense of only a modest increase in the rate of overtreatment of microscopy-negative patients from 7. 1 to 15. 4 %. Cost remains a major obstacle to widespread use in areas of endemicity...|$|R
40|$|The correct {{clinical}} diagnosis of an intraocular tumor can be difficult, especially the differentiation between a choroidal melanoma and a metastatic neoplasm. Although technological advances such as sonography and fluorescein angiography are helpful, false-positive diagnoses of choroidal melanoma continue to occur. Recent work with MR imaging suggests that choroidal melanomas can be differ-entiated from metastatic neoplasms {{on the basis}} of the characteris-tically short T 1 times of the first and the characteristically long T 1 times of the second. We report a case in which an intraocular tumor displayed MR signal characteristics (including a short T 1) consistent with the <b>presumptive</b> clinical <b>diagnosis</b> of choroidal melanoma, but enucleation and pathologic evaluation showed the tumor was a mucin-secreting adenocarcinoma metastatic to the choroid.

50|$|Testing for Ross River virus {{should occur}} in {{patients}} who are experiencing acute polyarthritis, tiredness and/or rashes (~90%) {{with a history of}} travel within areas prone to infection from the virus. Serology (blood tests) is the appropriate manner by which to diagnose Ross River virus. Within 7 days of infection, the virus produces Immunogobulin M (IgM) and is a <b>presumptive</b> positive <b>diagnosis.</b> IgM may persist for months or even years and therefore false positives may be triggered by Barmah Forest virus, rubella, Q fever or rheumatoid factor. To completely test for Ross River virus, a second serology test must be conducted 10-14 days after the first. The patient may then be declared positive for Ross River virus infection if there is a 4-fold increase of IgM antibody count.|$|R
