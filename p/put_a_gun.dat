5|$|In 1991, Gregory Banks, {{a convicted}} felon, filed {{a civil suit}} for $16 million in damages against Burge, three colleagues, and the City of Chicago for condoning {{brutality}} and torture. He {{said that he had}} falsely confessed in 1983 to murder after he was tortured by officers: they placed a plastic bag over his head, <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> in his mouth, and performed other acts. He said that the officers allegedly abused eleven other suspects, using such measures as electro-shock. The suit was brought by the People's Law Office attorneys who had represented Andrew Wilson in the 1989 police brutality case. The suit described 23 incidents against black and Hispanic suspects between 19721985. The Bank's suit named Sergeant Peter Dignan as one of the officers involved in the abuses. In 1995 Dignan was promoted for meritorious service, even though the City of Chicago had settled out of court with Banks on his suit.|$|E

[...] The settlers cut Yagan's head from his body, and skinned his back to obtain his tribal markings as a trophy. They buried the bodies a short distance away.|$|E

500|$|The single [...] "The Wire" [...] was {{released}} on July 29 and the album followed on September 30. The album reached {{number one in the}} UK and has since sold 200,000 copies there. To promote the album, the group performed [...] "The Wire" [...] on the BBC's The Andrew Marr Show, with Este dedicating the song to the British Prime Minister David Cameron, also a guest on the show. The move was criticised as being ill-judged by Johnny Marr, who stated that “It’s really simple: they made themselves look like idiots. It’s ridiculous. No-one <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> to their head. The Conservatives tried {{to do the same thing}} with The Smiths, to re-appropriate us in a false way, to be cool by association.” Haim did not respond.|$|E
500|$|Armitage {{performs}} his own stunts. When performing fight scenes, {{they would}} be choreographed carefully so Armitage could take part rather than a stunt double. For series eight, Armitage performed a fight scene in a swimming pool, which he thought was [...] "fun," [...] but also thought it was difficult as it was [...] "like acting and punching in slow motion." [...] In another sequence, he injured a stuntman with a hospital trolley. He was only given a short lesson {{on how to handle}} firearms, since he was already accustomed to using them whilst working on Ultimate Force. While discussing the shootout at the end of series seven, Armitage noted that he is [...] "not a violent person but when you <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> in somebody's hands [...] it's like a little animal comes out of you that wants to fire the gun again." ...|$|E

Concerned, the producers set up a body double on hand. However, Jones insisted she could do everything herself, {{and in the end}} the double was not used. During the first shootout scene in the episode, Miller wanted to make the sequence as real as possible by having the camera film as if it was under attack. Richard Armitage recalled the shootout sequence; [...] "There was a shoot-out in the final episode where I surprised myself about the amount of rounds I could pull off and how quickly. It's a weird thing. I'm not a violent person but when you <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> in somebody's hands something strange happens.
