40|$|Official {{rules for}} seed {{analysis}} don't establish criteria to execute germination tests for all species. This way, {{the aim of}} this research was to determinate the substrate, temperature and counting time for the germination test of physic nut seeds. For the germination test, four replications of 20 seeds were used, evaluating daily the normal seedlings until the end of germination. Initially, the substrates with sowing in vermiculite, were evaluated in rolled <b>paper</b> <b>towels,</b> in sand <b>and</b> in soil using alternating temperature of 20 - 30 degrees C. The most favorable substrates for germination were evaluated with another stage, using constant temperatures of 25, 30 and 35 degrees C and alternating ones, of 15 - 35 degrees C, 20 - 35 degrees C and 20 - 30 degrees C. One concluded that the germination test of physic nut seeds must be performed with the alternating temperature of 20 - 30 degrees C in sand or <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> <b>and</b> with final counting 10 days after sowing...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{growing demand}} for high quality soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] seeds {{requires}} a precise seed quality control system from the seed industry. One way to accomplish this is by improving vigor testing. Cold test has been traditionally employed for corn seeds. However, {{it has also been}} used for other seed crops such as cotton (Gossypium spp.), soybean (Glycine Max), dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and pea (Pisum sativum). This study was carried out with the objective of adjusting an alternative procedure for the cold test to determine soybean seed vigor. Six commercial soybean seed lots of the cultivar BRS 133 were used. The physiological potential of the seed lots was evaluated by germination on <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> <b>and</b> sand box, seedling field emergence, tetrazolium, accelerated aging and electrical conductivity tests. Seed moisture content was also determined. The temperature used for the cold test procedures was 10 °C during five days. Four cold test procedures were evaluated: i) plastic boxes with soil; ii) rolled <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> with soil; iii) rolled <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> without soil, <b>and</b> iv) an alternative procedure, using rolled <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> without soil under cold water. A completely randomized experimental design with eight replications was used and the means were compared by the Tukey test (p = 0. 05). To verify the dependence between the alternative test and others single linear correlation was used. All cold test procedures had similar coefficients of variation (CV), highlighting that rolled <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> with soil <b>and</b> the alternative procedure had the best performance, with an average of 94 % and 93 % normal seedlings and CV of 3. 2 % and 3. 6 %, respectively. The alternative procedure has satisfactory results for estimating soybean seed vigor, yielding consistent results compared to the traditional procedure...|$|R

After 30  min, the marble burying period concluded by removing the mouse, {{and the number of}} marbles that more than two-thirds covered with bedding material counted. Whether a marble buried was established by experimenters and was confirmed by manual post-experimental assessment of an investigator.
