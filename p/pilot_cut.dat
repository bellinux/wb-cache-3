There were six other passengers (four New Zealanders, one Australian and one Indian) on board. One female passenger was also injured. The copilot managed to restrain Abdille eventually. Abdille also claimed to have two bombs on board, but no explosives were found. The plane landed safely at Christchurch International Airport at 8:06 a.m.|$|R
50|$|Another type of {{adjustable}} hole saw, {{also called}} a circle cutter, is formed by having one, two, or three adjustable teeth {{on a platform}} with a <b>pilot</b> bit.

50|$|The MiGs were {{scrambled}} {{early in}} the afternoon. Nguyen Van Bay {{was the first one}} to spot the American flight far ahead of them. He asked permission to attack the Phantoms. The MiG's flight leader gave permission to give chase, but expressed doubt that they could catch the much faster American aircraft. As the MiG-17s moved toward the Phantoms, Nguyễn Văn Bảy saw Moonglow 3 initiate a climbing left turn. That turning maneuver allowed the MiG <b>pilot</b> to <b>cut</b> the diameter of the circle and close the distance between the opposing aircraft to 100 to 150 m to achieve an appropriate angle of attack. Nguyễn Văn Bảy aimed, then fired his 37mm and 23mm cannons at the Phantom.|$|R

2500|$|Without Soviet goods, from 1942 {{to the end}} of the war, German war {{efforts were}} {{severely}} hampered with Germany barely managing to scrape together enough reserves for a few more major offensives. [...] In terms of supplies, oil was the main obstacle, with shortages in some places by the end of 1941 and forcing Germany to turn south to attempt to invade the oil-rich Caucuses in 1942. The Reich was forced to exist on a hand-to-mouth basis for oil, and the almost non-existent oil stocks completely disappeared by mid-1944 with the Allied bombers concentration on German synthetic fuel plants. [...] For example, most German war aircraft sat idle, and air training for new <b>pilots</b> was <b>cut</b> to a mere one hour per week.|$|R

2500|$|The Westland Weasel was {{designed}} by Westland Aircraft of Yeovil to meet the Royal Air Force's Type IIIA Specification for a two-seat fighter/reconnaissance aircraft to replace the successful Bristol Fighter. An order for three prototypes was placed in April 1918, together with orders for competing designs from Bristol (the Badger) and Austin Motors (the Greyhound). The Weasel was a two-bay biplane of wood and fabric construction, with the pilot and observer/gunner seated close together in separate cockpits, with the upper wing above the <b>pilot</b> being <b>cut</b> away to improve the upwards view. Armament {{was similar to the}} Bristol Fighter, with two synchronised Vickers guns and one or two Lewis guns for the observer. [...] Like the other two competitors, the Weasel was powered by the officially encouraged ABC Dragonfly 9-cylinder air-cooled radial engine.|$|R
5000|$|In {{reviewing}} the aircraft in June 2016 after an evaluation flight, AOPA reviewer Dave Hirschman concluded, [...] "the 153-mph true airspeed top speed {{in level flight}} is impressive, but what’s far more meaningful to backcountry pilots is the tremendous range and operational flexibility they’ll have at more economical cruise settings. At a true airspeed of 120 mph, for example, an XCub <b>pilot</b> can <b>cut</b> fuel burn to 6 gph or less and have about eight hours endurance from a full tank (50 gallons) of avgas. At a normal Super Cub cruise of 100 mph, the XCub can cover 1,000 statute miles...The XCub is exhilarating to fly and aesthetically appealing inside and out. The clever layout of the panel, passenger seating, and stowage compartments show it was built by people who know their customers and the features they value." ...|$|R
5000|$|Former Olympic gymnast-turned-daredevil skydiver Ditch Brodie's (Charlie Sheen) jump {{school is}} under tight {{scrutiny}} by the FAA after {{a string of}} federal violations, culminating in an illegal BASE jump off a skyscraper. Upon returning to his school, he's approached by a beautiful but nervous woman named Chris Morrow (Nastassja Kinski), whom insists on performing a static jump from cruising altitude immediately. Playing along due to her flirtatious attitude, Ditch agrees to take her despite claims that she has never skydived before. During the flight over, Chris briefly spots another aircraft below. When Ditch checks the plane's mechanical status with his <b>pilot,</b> Chris <b>cuts</b> ties with Ditch before leaping out on her own. Ditch spots Chris tumbling uncontrollably below him, and despite his best attempts, is unable to save her before she hits the ground at terminal velocity. An investigation ensues, and the school is closed down indefinitely.|$|R

50|$|The Monosoupape had no {{carburetor}} or throttle, {{and since}} most of its air supply was taken in through the exhaust valve, {{it could not be}} controlled by adjusting the air supply to the crankcase like other rotaries. Monosoupapes therefore had a single petrol regulating control used for a limited degree of speed regulation. In early examples, engine speed could be controlled by varying the opening time and extent of the exhaust valves using levers acting on the valve tappet rollers, but this was later abandoned due to causing burning of the valves.2 Instead, a blip switch was used, which cut out the ignition when pressed. This was used sparingly to avoid fouling the spark plugs, since it was only safe to be used when the fuel supply was also cut. Some later Monosoupapes were fitted with a selector switch which allowed the <b>pilot</b> to <b>cut</b> out three or six cylinders instead of all nine when hitting the blip switch, so that each cylinder fired only once per three engine revolutions but the engine remained in perfect balance.|$|R
2500|$|The loss of heat {{removal from}} the primary loop {{and the failure of}} the {{auxiliary}} system to activate caused the primary loop pressure to increase, triggering the pilot-operated relief valve [...] {{at the top of the}} pressurizera pressure active-regulator tankto open automatically. The relief valve should have closed when the excess pressure had been released, and electric power to the solenoid of the <b>pilot</b> was automatically <b>cut,</b> but the relief valve stuck open because of a mechanical fault. The open valve permitted coolant water to escape {{from the primary}} system, and was the principal mechanical cause of the primary coolant system depressurization and partial core disintegration that followed.|$|R
5000|$|On June 12, 2008, the Federal Aviation Administration issued Emergency Airworthiness Directive AD 2008-13-51 {{grounding}} all Eclipse 500s, {{following an}} incident at Chicago's Midway Airport.

But when the <b>pilot</b> tried to <b>cut</b> power a few seconds later, as the airplane touched down, the engines began accelerating to maximum power." [...] The pilots overshot, gained altitude and shut down one engine, eventually landing without injury or damage except blown out tires.|$|R
50|$|The {{basic idea}} {{of all the}} events is {{that a number of}} models (up to three) fly together, aiming to {{complete}} a given number of laps before any of the others. The model is also required to make multiple pit stops during the race, where it is refueled, the engine restarted, and the model re-launched. This is the job of the pit crew. There are rules describing how the pilots must walk around each other, and how to pass (harder than one might think, as each model is {{on the end of a}} pair of control lines and travelling as fast as 140 mph). Pit stops require that the model be refueled and restarted - which can be a problem with a very hot racing engines. The best FAI Team Race pit stops take around 2-3 seconds for the <b>pilot</b> to <b>cut</b> the motor and land, allowing the pit-man to catch the model which only moments ago was flying at 140 mi/h km/h, fill the tank with 7cc of model fuel from a pressurized tank, adjust the engine mixture and compression if needed, restart, and relaunch the model.|$|R

50|$|Cliff and Peat became {{partners}} {{with a common}} goal. They had several meetings with local Congressman M Clyde Kelly to convince Kelly of the benefits in bringing aviation to the Pittsburgh area. Cliff and Peat would continue to lobby for aviation with local business men while Kelly took it to congress. In 1924 Cliff and Peat began {{to raise money to}} expand the airfield. Cliff mortgaged everything he owned and they borrowed the rest. They used the money to buy the property from Neal for $35,000 in August 1925. Cliff was President and Peat was Vice-President of the new Pittsburgh-McKeesport air field PMA. PMA started out on 25 acres. They used the leftover money from the purchase of the property along with additional funding, from Sam Brendel, Neel and Cliff's brother Albert Ball, and they erected a building that was used as a combination machine shop, concession stand and living quarters for <b>pilots.</b> Peat <b>cut</b> down trees and ran a tractor filling in ditches adding an additional 18 acres of useful space to the airfield. Cliff would stage aerial stunts and plane rides as well as running the concession stand. In 1925 Cliff hired a secretary, Helen Marie Stinner, who also acted as gatekeeper and ticket taker.|$|R
25|$|Soviet {{training}} left {{much to be}} desired. Stalin’s purges had deprived the VVS of its {{senior and}} best commanders. It heralded a debilitating decline in military effectiveness. In the event of the Winter War and the German victory in the French Campaign, the Soviet leadership panicked and Stalin ordered a hasty overhaul of the armed forces. Order 0362, 22 December 1940, of the People’s Commissar Defence ordered the accelerated training program for pilots which meant the cutting of training time. The program had already been cut owing to an earlier defence order, 008, dated 14 March 1940. It {{put an end to}} the flight training for volunteers, and instituted mass drafts. In February 1941, <b>pilot</b> training was <b>cut</b> further leading to a disastrous drop in the quality of pilot training prior to Barbarossa.|$|R
