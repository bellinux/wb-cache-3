40|$|Vitamin D {{deficiency}} {{has been}} reported in pediatric burn patients; however, no formal studies have been conducted in adult burn populations. The available literature on vitamin D status in burn patients has been reviewed. A literature search was conducted using Medline™, the Cochrane central register of controlled trials, and EMBASE to identify any trials of vitamin D deficiency in burn patients. Six published studies regarding vitamin D status in burn patients were found; however, five of these were in pediatric populations and several did not assess vitamin D levels as a major endpoint. Vitamin D deficiency has been demonstrated to result in itching, muscle weakness, and neuropathy, all of which are common postburn sequelae. The major source of vitamin D is synthesis in the skin with a small amount being absorbed through dietary intake. Population groups are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency if they have inadequate exposure to UV light or reduced biosynthetic capability due to skin damage. Burn patients fall into both risk groups and also suffer common complaints that overlap with those reported by patients with vitamin D deficiency. Further research in adult burn patients is needed to determine the prevalence of deficiency in this population and whether vitamin D deficiency might influence postburn injury symptoms reported by patients.

He still kept one foot in the world of secular country during the early 1970s [...] - [...] writing and producing [...] "Woman (Sensuous Woman)" [...] for Don Gibson (a Grammy nominee and a million-plus seller in three different versions) along with two other country-chart hits, and at one point signing with RCA Records as a solo country artist [...] - [...] but gospel was now his chief priority. In 1973 he wrote and produced [...] "L-O-V-E" [...] for The Blackwood Brothers, who took home the Grammy for Best Gospel Performance. In 1975, Paxton won the Best Inspirational Grammy for his album The Astonishing, Outrageous, Amazing, Incredible, Unbelievable, Different World of Gary <b>S.</b> <b>Paxton,</b> which contained his oft-recorded devotional song [...] "He Was There All the Time". Appearing on his gospel album covers in a halo of facial hair and a tall-top cowboy hat, Paxton infused his religious work with the same eccentricity, individuality, and hippie humor that had characterized his 60s material in Los Angeles: acting the role of the Jesus freak, likening himself to [...] "an armpit in the body of Christ", and crafting song titles like [...] "When the Meat Wagon Comes for You", [...] "Will There Be Hippies in Heaven?", [...] "I'm a Fool for Christ (Whose Fool Are You?)", and [...] "Jesus Is My Lawyer in Heaven".|$|R
5000|$|The Peace and Truce of God {{movement}} {{was one of}} the ways that the Church attempted to Christianize the feudal structures of society through non-violent means. After the collapse of the Carolingian empire in the ninth century, France had degenerated into many small counties and lordships, in which local lords and knights frequently fought each other for control. The West Frankish nobility capitalized on the accession of the Carolingian throne and ushered in the Capetian dynasty and further altered French, and by extension, European medieval society. One of the critical points of this dynastic shift is what Guy Bois characterizes [...] "the mutation of the year 1000," [...] wherein the period is known for the inexorable link between chaos and creativity. The chaos of the period is attributed to the issue of violent feuding, with the castellans and their milites working towards consolidated power and freedom from the overarching political structure of the Carolingian empire. Frederick <b>S.</b> <b>Paxton</b> argues that the political and cultural landscape of the period highlights some of the prevailing cultural anxieties and issues surrounding the millennium, particularly [...] "unparalleled disorder in governmental, legal, and social institutions" [...] and Carolingian society was faced with a [...] "king unable and the nobility unwilling to act causing the French people, imbued with a 'national spirit' peculiarly creative in the fight against political and social ills, turned to spiritual sanctions as the only available means to limit violence." ...|$|R
40|$|Sandiland {{explores the}} nature of human {{movement}} in intermedial spaces, hybrid areas where immediate and virtual space overlap, using interactive video installations. A large project, funded through ACE's Capture fund (£ 20, 000), this was the outcome of research collaboration with choreographer Rosemary Lee (ResCen). It has toured 10 venues in UK and Europe so far. Research methods: The installation sets up an evolving dialogue between real and virtual dancer, as when improvising in a duet in the physical world. It explores the linear relationship between two moving bodies in space: a member of the public and a “virtual dancer”. Using motion-tracking and real-time video scratching, the viewer's movement affects the movement and proximity of an on-screen dancer. The nature of this composite choreography is at the centre of Sandiland's research and forms part of his PhD studies. Whereas Jeffrey Shaw, Thamas Waliczky and others tend to focus on visual experience, Sandiland examines the somatic relationship between real and mediatised spaces in two respects: 1. Viewer to media: unlike most installations, detection here embraces subtle movements of the interactor (the “small dance of the body” <b>S.</b> <b>Paxton</b> 1977), central to many contemporary dance practices. 2. Media to viewer. Using video footage of real dancers the physical empathy of the live interactor is explored, drawing from neurobiologal research into how the brain processes images of another moving body and maps or relates these motions to the subject's own body movement (the brain's “mirror neurons” discovered by Giacomo Rizzolatti in 1980 / 90 s). A new phase of the research is using qualitative responses from interviews and comments books collected from all the venues.

5000|$|Pickett co-wrote [...] "Monster Mash" [...] with Leonard Capizzi in May 1962. The {{song was}} a spoof {{on the dance}} crazes popular at the time, {{including}} the Twist and the Mashed Potato, which inspired the title. The song featured Pickett's impersonations of veteran horror stars Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi (the latter with the line [...] "Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?"). It was passed on by every major record label, but after hearing the song, Gary <b>S.</b> <b>Paxton</b> agreed to produce and engineer it; among the musicians who played on it was pianist Leon Russell. Issued on Paxton's Garpax Records, the single became a million seller, reaching #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for two weeks before Halloween in 1962. It was styled as being by [...] "Bobby 'Boris' Pickett & the Crypt-Kickers". The track re-entered the U.S. charts twice, in August 1970, and again in May 1973, when it reached the #10 spot. In Britain it took until October 1973 for the tune to become popular, peaking at #3 in the UK Singles Chart. For the second time, the record sold over one million copies. The tune remains a Halloween perennial on radio and on iTunes. A Christmas-themed follow-up, [...] "Monster's Holiday", (b/w [...] "Monster Motion") was also released in 1962 and reached #30 in December that year. [...] "Blood Bank Blues" [...] (b/w [...] "Me And My Mummy") did not chart. This was followed by further monster-themed recordings such as the album The Original Monster Mash and such singles as [...] "Werewolf Watusi" [...] and [...] "The Monster Swim". In 1973, Pickett rerecorded [...] "Me And My Mummy" [...] for a Metromedia 45 (it did not chart). Another of Pickett's songs, [...] "Graduation Day", made #80 in June 1963. In 1985, with American culture experiencing a growing awareness of rap music, Pickett released [...] "Monster Rap", which describes the mad scientist's frustration at being unable to teach the dancing monster from [...] "Monster Mash" [...] how to talk. The problem is solved when he teaches the monster to rap.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Differences in {{survivorship}} of non-posterior-stabilized {{compared with}} posterior-stabilized knee designs carry substantial economic consequences, especially with limited health-care resources. However, these comparisons {{have often been}} made between relatively small groups of patients, often with short-term follow-up, with only small differences demonstrated between the groups. The goal {{of this study is}} to compare the outcomes of non-posterior-stabilized and posterior-stabilized total knee arthroplasties with use of a unique collaboration of multiple established knee arthroplasty registries. METHODS: A distributed health data network was developed by the International Consortium of Orthopaedic Registries and was used in this study to reduce barriers to participation (such as security, propriety, legal, and privacy issues) compared with a centralized data warehouse approach. The study included only replacements in osteoarthritis patients who underwent total knee procedures involving fixed-bearing devices from 2001 to 2010. The outcome of interest was time to first revision. RESULTS: On average, not resurfacing showed a more harmful effect than resurfacing did when posterior-stabilized and non-posterior-stabilized knee replacements were compared, while the risk of revision for posterior-stabilized compared with non-posterior-stabilized knees was highest in year zero to one, followed by year one to two, years eight through ten, and years two through eight. Posterior-stabilized knees did significantly worse than non-posterior-stabilized knees did when the patella was not resurfaced. This difference was most pronounced in the first two years (year zero to one: hazard ratio [HR] = 2. 15, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 56 to 2. 95, p < 0. 001; year one to two: HR = 1. 61, 95 % CI = 1. 48 to 1. 75, p < 0. 001). When the patella was resurfaced, posterior-stabilized knees did significantly worse than non-posterior-stabilized knees did. This was again most pronounced in the first two years (year zero to one: HR = 1. 75, 95 % CI = 1. 27 to 2. 42, p = 0. 001; year one to two: HR = 1. 31, 95 % CI = 1. 19 to 1. 45, p < 0. 001). There was a reduced risk of revision with a patient age of more than sixty-five years (HR = 0. 57, 95 % CI = 0. 55 to 0. 60, p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: We found that fixed non-posterior-stabilized total knee arthroplasty performed better with or without patellar resurfacing than did fixed posterior-stabilized total knee arthroplasty. This effect was most pronounced in the first two years. The risk of revision for posterior-stabilized total knee arthroplasties was reduced with patellar resurfacing. Also, a patient age of more than sixty-five years and female gender reduced the risk of revision.

40|$|O que motivou esta Tese foi a possibilidade de realizar uma investiga????o sobre o simbolismo do espa??o escolar, sob a perspectiva da fenomenologia e da antropologia do imagin??rio, procurando, por meio do desenho (croquis) e da escrita (devaneios) apoiada em suportes te??ricos, intima????es do vivido e das lembran??as do autor, contribuir com as discuss??es sobre os sentidos do simbolismo do espa??o escolar, entre professores, alunos, arquitetos e designers. O texto caracteriza-se como uma narrativa topoanal??tica sobre os espa??os-lembran??as de tr??s col??gios (Bom Conselho, Prot??sio Alves e Nicolau de Ara??jo Vergueiro, em Passo Fundo/RS) e tem como base te??rica {{principal}} Gaston Bachelard e Gilbert Durand. A topoan??lise, como leitura hermen??utica dos fen??menos do espa??o escolar, buscou capturar a conforma????o simb??lica e o modo como eles emergiram num dado aspecto particular, que, por sua vez, se moldaram num determinado contexto hist??rico e sociocultural. O ser emp??rico do espa??o escolar - a sua mat??ria, os documentos, as fotografias - constituiu efetivamente uma matriz de compreens??o que permitiu a recolha das subst??ncias de verdade, as resson??ncias e repercuss??es contidas nos espa??os-lembran??as. Atrav??s da fenomenot??cnica o espa??o pronunciou-se, disse enquanto inven????o, enquanto constru????o. Articulou-se como comprometimento de um corpo/mente symbolicus com a concretude das coisas, dos outros e do mundo. A percep????o e a representa????o do espa??o evidenciam-se assim como um processo cultural e simb??lico. Finalmente, ressalto que a identidade do espa??o <b>escolar</b> <b>s??</b> ser?? respeitada se entendida no que cabe dentro das margens dos projetos pedag??gicos e arquitet??nicos pensados para a escola, mas tamb??m no que os excede. A despropor????o desafia os conceitos e p??e em causa os limites das planifica????es, das classifica????es e das assimila????es que neles assentam. Hermes e Dion??sio que o digam. Para este estudo da Simb??lica do Espa??o Escolar: narrativas topoanal??ticas foram convocadas a din??mica dos s??mbolos e a sabedoria primordial dos mitos para que ajudassem a melhor pensar, com a topoan??lise e a fenomenot??cnica, o sentido oriundo de um novo esp??rito espacialWhat motivated {{this thesis}} {{was the possibility}} to accomplish an investigation about {{the symbolism of the}} school space, under the perspective of the phenomenology and of the anthropology of the imaginary, seeking, through picture (drawings) and writing (musings) leaned on theoretical supports, citations of the experienced and on the author's memories, to contribute with the discussions on the senses of the symbolism of the school space, among teachers, students, architects and designers. The text is characterized as a topo analytic narrative on the space-memories of three schools (Bom Conselho, Prot??sio Alves and Nicolau de Ara??jo Vergueiro, in Passo Fundo/RS) and it has as main theoretical base Gaston Bachelard and Gilbert Durand. The topoanalyses, as hermeneutical reading of the phenomena of the school space, sought to capture the symbolic resignation and the way they emerged in a particular given aspect, and thereby molded themselves in a certain historical and sociocultural context. The empiric being of the school space its matter, documents, pictures - constituted a matrix of understanding that allowed the collection of true substances, the resonances and repercussions contained in the space-memories. Through the phenomenontechnic the space pronounced itself, as an invention, as a construction. It voiced as a commitment of a body/mind symbolicus with the concreteness of the things, of the others and of the world. The perception and the representation of the space are evidenced as well as a cultural and symbolic process. At last, I point out that the identity of the school space will only be respected if it is understood in what fits inside the margins of the pedagogic and architectural projects thought to the school, but also in what it exceeds them. The disproportion challenges the concepts and it puts in cause the limits of the planning, of the classifications and of the assimilations that dwell in them. As would Hermes and Dionysus say. For this study on The Symbolic of the School Space: topo analytic narratives were summoned to the dynamics of the symbols and the primordial wisdom of the myths so that they helped to think best, with the topo analyses and the phenomenontechnic, about the sense originating from a new space spiri...|$|R

Nesse contexto, implantam-se pol?ticas p?blicas promotoras de inclus?o voltadas para a igualdade de oportunidades e convivialidade. Assim, o objetivo geral deste estudo foi {{investigar}} o preconceito e o contato intergrupal nos N?cleos de Apoio as Pessoas com Necessidades Espec?ficas (NAPNE <b>s),</b> relacionados ? inclus?o <b>escolar</b> em classe comum. Para alcan?ar este objetivo, justificou-se como aporte te?rico ampliar as reflex?es frente ? teoria do preconceito, do qual este trabalho se apropria dos conhecimentos acerca da teoria das representa??es sociais veiculadas neste meio pol?ticas p?blicas de inclus?o - a luz da teoria do contato e das rela??es intergrupais, por entender que estrat?gias baseadas no contato podem abrir novos horizontes, numa rela??o de trocas que existe entre o que ? intraps?quico, interpessoal, intergrupal ou societal. A amostra composta por 118 integrantes professores e administrativos - dos n?cleos de inclus?o do programa TECNEP/SETEC/MEC, denominados de NAPNE s, dos Institutos Federais brasileiro, com 75, 4 % do sexo feminino, 41, 5 % com idades entre 30 - 39 anos, com menos de 10 anos de atua??o profissional (58, 5 %), e 70, 3 % preparados para o trabalho com deficientes. Aplicou-se o M?todo descritivo explicativo com abordagem qualitativa e quantitativa, tendo um car?ter descritivo. O instrumento utilizado foi um question?rio semi estruturado contemplando aspectos relativos ? atua??o; o apoio recebido; o grau de satisfa??o com as instala??es e as principais dificuldades ou obst?culos. As vari?veis foram mensuradas em escalas do tipo Likert e de Bogardus (1925), e por fim, quest?es sociodemogr?ficas. Estes dados foram processados utilizando os softwares SPSS e EVOC, e analisados atrav?s de estat?stica descritiva. Os resultados mostraram 70, 3 % dos integrantes participando das rela??es intergrupais, por?m 85, 6 % insatisfeitos com as instala??es escolares e apenas 14, 4 % satisfeitos com o apoio institucional recebido, na escola h? falta de contato nas rela??es (90, 6 %) junto as Pessoas com Necessidades Espec?ficas se mostrando quase inexistente. A segrega??o foi rejeitada (92, 3 %). No que se referem aos resultados das an?lises entende-se que falta apoio de toda ordem aos n?cleos, inexiste um contato efetivo, os integrantes est?o ?vidos em participar do processo concordando com a comunalidade da sala, e que esta pol?tica p?blica de inclus?o na forma como se encontra provoca preconceito institucional, ensejando ajustes operacionais. A pesquisa mostra que a forma de trazer efeitos que resultariam em diminui??o do preconceito numa rela??o de diferen?as culturais e sociais aceit?veis pela sociedade moderna seja o contato intergrupal planejado e estruturado, e que, os N?cleos podem influenciar no processo da inclus?o quando h? maior frequ?ncia nos contatos intergrupais. In {{the face}} of globalization and international agreements, {{the politics of the}} Brazilian government began to prioritize in their educational system, care for the disabled in regular classes in regular education - National Education Plan (Goal 4, 2012). Then comes a new scenario in daily school where the social aspect of relations, prejudice has a prominent place. In this context, deploying up promoting public policies aimed at inclusion of equal opportunities and conviviality. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate prejudice and intergroup contact in the Nucleus of Support to People with Special Needs (NAPNE's) related to educational inclusion in regular class. To accomplish this, was justified as the theoretical reflections extend toward theory of prejudice, which this work appropriates the knowledge about the theory of social representations conveyed in this medium - public politics of inclusion - the light of the theory of contact and of intergroup relations, understanding that strategies based on contact can open new horizons in terms of trade that exists between what is intrapsychic, interpersonal, intergroup or societal. The sample comprised 118 members - teachers and administrators - the inclusion of core TECNEP/ SETEC/ MEC program called NAPNE s, the Brazilian Federal Institutes, with 75, 4 % female, 41, 5 % aged 30 - 39 years old, with less than 10 years of professional experience (58, 5 %), and 70, 3 % prepared to work with the disabled. We used the descriptive method with qualitative and quantitative explanatory approach with a descriptive character. The instrument used was a semi-structured questionnaire addressing aspects of performance; support received, the degree of satisfaction with the facilities and the main difficulties or obstacles. Variables were measured on the Likert scales and Bogardus (1925), and finally, sociodemographic questions. These data were processed using the SPSS software and EVOC, and analyzed using descriptive statistics. The results showed 70, 3 % of members participating in intergroup relations, but 85, 6 % dissatisfied with school facilities and only 14, 4 % satisfied with the institutional support received, at the school for lack of contact in relationships (90, 6 %) with Persons with Special Needs showing almost nonexistent. Segregation was rejected (92, 3 %). In referring to the results of the analysis means a lack of support of all kinds to the cores, nonexistent effective contact, members are eager to participate in the process agreeing with the commonality of the room, and that the public politics of inclusion in the way is causing institutional bias, allowing for operational adjustments. Research shows that the way to bring effects that would result in decreased bias in the ratio of acceptable cultural and social differences in modern society is the planned and structured intergroup contact, and that the cores can influence the process of inclusion when there are more frequent in intergroup contacts...|$|R
