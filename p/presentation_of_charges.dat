40|$|N-BAR domains are protein modules {{that bind}} to and induce {{curvature}} in membranes via a charged concave surface and N-terminal amphipathic helices. Recently, molecular dynamics simulations {{have demonstrated that}} the N-BAR domain can induce a strong local curvature that matches the curvature of the BAR domain surface facing the bilayer. Here we present further molecular dynamics simulations that examine in greater detail {{the roles of the}} concave surface and amphipathic helices in driving local membrane curvature. We find that the strong curvature induction observed in our previous simulations requires the stable <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>charged</b> concave surface to the membrane and is not driven by the membrane-embedded amphipathic helices. Nevertheless, without these amphipathic helices embedded in the membrane, the N-BAR domain does not maintain a close association with the bilayer, and fails to drive membrane curvature. Increasing the membrane negative charge through the addition of PIP 2 facilitates closer association with the membrane in the absence of embedded helices. At sufficiently high concentrations, amphipathic helices embedded in the membrane drive membrane curvature independently of the BAR domain...|$|R

50|$|Calsequestrin is a calcium-binding protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The protein helps hold calcium in the {{cisterna}} of the sarcoplasmic reticulum after {{a muscle}} contraction, {{even though the}} concentration of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum {{is much higher than}} in the cytosol. It also helps the sarcoplasmic reticulum store an extraordinarily high amount of calcium ions. Each molecule of calsequestrin can bind 18 to 50 Ca2+ ions. Sequence analysis has suggested that calcium is not bound in distinct pockets via EF-hand motifs, but rather via <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>charged</b> protein surface. Two forms of calsequestrin have been identified. The cardiac form Calsequestrin-2 (CASQ2) is present in cardiac and slow skeletal muscle and the fast skeletal form Calsequestrin-1(CASQ1) is found in fast skeletal muscle. The release of calsequestrin-bound calcium (through a calcium release channel) triggers muscle contraction. The active protein is not highly structured, more than 50% of it adopting a random coil conformation. When calcium binds there is a structural change whereby the alpha-helical content of the protein increases from 3 to 11%. Both forms of calsequestrin are phosphorylated by casein kinase 2, but the cardiac form is phosphorylated more rapidly and to a higher degree. Calsequestrin is also secreted in the gut where it deprives bacteria of calcium ions..|$|R

40|$|After {{many years}} of {{teaching}} international students, I realized there is a rather limited and reoccurring list of problems in the students’ writing. These problems seem {{to be present in}} students’ writing regardless of their country of origin or first language. While many of these problems do not constitute a “fatal flaw”, they seriously undermine effectiveness of their written communication. To put in simple words, they make it harder for a reader to understand one’s true message. And this often {{has little to do with}} one’s knowledge of English. Therefore, this poster focuses primarily on the fundamental principles of written communication that make communication more effective regardless of which language is used for communication. Written communication effectiveness is defined here as the ability to get your recipient understand your true intended message with the minimum amount of time and effort. If English is a second or third language for a student, this does not automatically put him her at a disadvantage with respect to written communication. International students can still learn how to communicate effectively in written form despite the limited vocabulary or lack of understanding of many of the nuances of English grammar. Teaching international students these principles of effective written communication requires educating them about those principles and enforcing those principles in every assignment. These principles can be communicated and enforced via handouts, presentations and written communication rubrics.

This Experience IT session provide {{an overview of}} how to the use of inexpensive haptic devices can be used to enhance learning and retention. The session will include hands-on experiences using an inexpensive haptic device. 3 Brief History As early as 1965, Ivan Sutherland, the father of computer graphics, defined an “ultimate display ” that consisted of visual, haptic, smell, taste, and audio displays that could eventually provide a complete virtual experience that could not distinguish the real. Indeed, the recent advancements in graphics, display, sound, and haptics technologies made it possible to create increasingly immersive and multimodal interactions between users and virtual environments. 4 The Ultimate Display (1965) “We live in a physical world whose properties we have come to know well through long familiarity … We lack corresponding familiarity with the forces on charged particles, forces in non-uniform fields, the effects of nonprojective geometric transformations, and high-inertia, low friction motion. [The ultimate display can give] us a chance to gain familiarity with concepts not realizable in the physical world. It is a looking glass into a mathematical wonderland… The force required to move a joystick could be computer controlled [...] . With such a display, a computer model of particles in an electric field could combine manual control of the position, <b>of</b> a moving <b>charge,</b> replete with the sensation of forces on the <b>charge,</b> with visual <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>charge's</b> position… By working with such [visual and haptic] displays of mathematical phenomena we can learn to know them as well as we know our own natural world.

40|$|The E 5 oncoprotein of bovine papillomavirus, only 44 {{amino acids}} long, occurs as a disulfide-bonded transmembrane dimer. This {{remarkable}} oncoprotein stimulates signal transduction through {{activation of the}} platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor, and E 5 exhibits limited amino acid sequence similarity with PDGF. Results presented here suggest that a key feature of the hydrophobic transmembrane domain is an amino acid side chain that participates in interhelical hydrogen bond formation. These data are reminiscent of the activated neu oncogene, in which a point mutation in the transmembrane domain leads to ligand-independent dimerization and activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase. Significantly, the transmembrane domain of E 5 can be largely replaced by the transmembrane domain from the activated neu receptor tyrosine kinase. Extensive mutagenesis defines the minimal structural features required for transformation by the E 5 oncoprotein as, first, the ability to dimerize and, second, <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> a negatively <b>charged</b> residue at the extracellular side of the membrane. The biological activity of E 5 mutants that lack most amino acid residues similar to PDGF suggests that E 5 and PDGF activate the PDGF receptor by distinct mechanisms...|$|R
