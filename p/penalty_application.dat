In the course of the Inquiry, the ALRC examined some 72 federal statutes that impose some form of civil (or administrative) penalty. Many are relatively silent on procedure.

Justice Breyer recently echoed the concurring opinions of Furman in his dissenting opinion from Glossip v.

5000|$|Currently {{only three}} freight railroads, Union Pacific, Florida East Coast and CSX Transportation, have adopted {{any form of}} ATC on their own networks. The systems on both FEC and CSX work in {{conjunction}} with pulse code cab signals, which {{in the case of}} CSX was inherited from the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac railroad on its single main line. Union Pacific's was inherited on portions of the Chicago and Northwestern east-west main line and works in conjunction with an early two aspect cab signaling system designed for use with ATC. On CSX and FEC more restrictive cab signal changes require the engineer to initiate a minimum brake application or face a more severe <b>penalty</b> <b>application</b> that will bring the train to a stop. Neither system requires explicit speed control or adherence to a braking curve. [...] The Union Pacific system requires an immediate brake application that cannot be released until the train's speed has been reduced to 40 mph (for any train traveling above that speed). Then, the train's speed must be further reduced to no more than 20 mph within 70 seconds of the initial cab signal drop. Failure to apply the brakes for these speed reductions will result in a <b>penalty</b> <b>application.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{civil penalty}} regime was {{introduced}} in 1993 to ensure ASIC would have at its disposal criminal penalties for conduct that is genuinely criminal in nature and civil penalties for breaches of the directors' duties where no criminality is involved. The regime was designed to comply with strategic regulation theory. This thesis examines ASIC's use of the civil penalty regime {{for the purpose of}} determining whether or not ASIC has utilized it for the reasons for which it was introduced. One of the research questions examined in this thesis {{is whether or not the}} civil penalty regime has provided ASIC with an effective enforcement mechanism for non-criminal contraventions of the civil penalty provisions. In order to answer that question this thesis examines the factors which inform ASIC's choice of the civil penalty regime. Various factors inform ASIC's choice, however in situations where ASIC has the choice of the civil penalty or the criminal regime, the overriding factor is ASIC's and the DPP's stated policy to pursue a criminal prosecution in all cases where there is sufficient evidence to support one. A consequence of the implementation of this policy is that very few civil <b>penalty</b> <b>applications</b> have been issued when compared with other enforcement activity instigated by ASIC. The civil penalty regime has been utilised almost exclusively in situations where a criminal prosecution was not available, or the DPP was satisfied there was insufficient evidence to sustain one. This factor, coupled with the fact that ASIC has achieved a high level of success with the civil <b>penalty</b> <b>applications</b> it has issued means that the civil penalty regime has provided ASIC with an effective enforcement mechanism for contraventions of the civil penalty provisions in situations where a criminal prosecution could not have been sustained or was not available. Another research question examined in this thesis is whether the civil penalty regime has been utilised in a manner envisaged by strategic regulation theory. A consequence of the adoption of a policy of issuing criminal prosecutions in all cases where one is available is that the civil penalty regime does not map on to the enforcement pyramid in a manner envisaged by strategic regulation theory.

40|$|Starting on January 1, 2007, the Supreme People's Court {{has been}} charged with {{reviewing}} every death sentence pronounced by lower courts in the People's Republic of China. This reform, together with provisions instituted in January 2007 that address death penalty review, are dramatic moves to strengthen procedural justice in death penalty cases. There are indications that these reforms have significantly decreased the execution rate in China. The reforms are not a move toward the Chinese government's abolition of capital punishment, however. Nor are they a response to international abolitionist pressure. Rather, they reflect the current "legalization" agenda of the central government, maintaining the instrumentalist link between overarching state policy and death <b>penalty</b> <b>application.</b> This "legalization" agenda will not necessarily prompt further limitations to death penalty practice.

40|$|Following slavery, capital {{punishment}} is slowly finding {{its way toward}} abolition. This trend is manifested both in international criminal law norms and international human rights norms. In the international criminal law field, {{capital punishment}}, accepted under the Nuremberg and Tokyo Charters, was rejected {{half a century later}} in the Statute of the International Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia, then in the Statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda, and most recently in the Rome Statute. Parallel to developments in the international criminal law field, a similar evolution was experienced in the area of international human rights. The trend towards abolition in the human rights field began with the restriction of the death <b>penalty</b> <b>application</b> to a certain group of people and crimes. However, a European human rights instrument, Protocol No. 6 to the ECHR, shifted the trend from restriction to abolition of the death penalty. For the abolitionist cause to succeed, the abolitionist trend should be accepted by retentionist countries such as the US and the Islamic states of the Middle East and Africa.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{dimensions of}} noncognitive functioning {{based on the}} administration of 22 measures of personality, social attitudes, values, and social norms in 35 countries (Ns ranging from 9 to 430; Total N= 1895). Four essentially identical factors were found at individual and country level: Personality/Social Attitudes; Values; Social Norms, and Conservatism. The four factors were correlated at country level, yielding a second-order Conservatism/Liberalism (combining Conservatism and Values) and a Harshness/Softness factor (combining Personality/Social Attitudes and Norms). Broad Conservatism/Liberalism is akin to Inglehart 2 ̆ 7 s (1997) contrast between survival and well-being; it was negatively correlated with countries 2 ̆ 7 affluence, educational achievement indicators, and measures of mass communication and freedom. The Harshness/Softness factor contrasts countries that are tough and harsh/unforgiving and countries that are warm and tolerant; it is related to Gelfand et al. 2 ̆ 7 s (2011) tightness/looseness dimension. Harshness/Softness factor was (negatively) correlated with death penalty, murder rate and muggings, {{and the proportion of}} Christians; it was positively correlated with Minkov 2 ̆ 7 s (2011) index of Industry and his index of countries 2 ̆ 7 death <b>penalty</b> <b>application.</b> It is concluded that the domain of noncognitive psychological functioning has a fairly corresponding structure at individual and country levels...|$|E
