40|$|The {{explosive}} forming of steel blanks into a <b>perforated</b> square <b>die</b> of side 200 mm and depth 40 mm has been investigated. The {{results show that}} blanks can be successfully formed with <b>perforated</b> <b>dies</b> and that the smaller the percentage of perforation and vent size, the greater the quantity of explosive needed for successful forming. The results also show that the indentation of deformed blanks at the vents is more prominent when large sized vents are used, and decreases with increase in standoff distance. The results also show that better die filling {{at the corners of}} the die is obtained if more vents are provided at the corners of the die...|$|R

50|$|This material, {{known as}} Perforated card-board at the time, first became {{available}} in the 1820s as plain sheets used {{for the creation of}} bookmarks and small mottoes and sayings, often taken from the Bible. By the 1870s the Victorian craze for this inexpensive and versatile craft material was at its peak. The invention of new printing processes made the pre-printing of mottoes and bookmarks on the perforated paper possible. These items were extremely popular and original examples, in good condition, can still be found today. The Victorian fad of embroidering mottoes on <b>perforated</b> paper <b>died</b> out around 1910 and was virtually lost as a needleart until recently being rediscovered. Perforated paper {{as we know it today}} was invented by Justin Ruble of Pennsylvania.|$|R

40|$|Mini-extrusion {{technology}} is particularly suited {{for use in}} developing countries or remote areas, where traditional large-scale processes are infeasible due to either cost or practicality. As a high-temperature, short-time process, extrusion can yield a nutritious soy flour product with high efficiency and control. ^ Heat treatment of de-hulled whole soy chips via a prototype mini-extruder with a throughput of 60 lb/hr was performed, in order to inactivate antinutritional factors naturally present in soy. The level of heat treatment in soy protein products is typically determined by assay of the activity of an indicator enzyme, urease. Previous studies have shown {{a strong correlation between}} urease inactivation and the inactivation of other antinutrional factors by steaming. However, the relationship between the thermal inactivation of Trypsin Inhibitors, a key antinutritional factor in soy, and urease, a thermal inactivation curve was determined for extrusion cooking, showing the relationship between extruder die temperature and deactivation. Results show that {{there is a difference between}} Trypsin Inhibitor activity and urease activity at extrusion temperature of 130 165 °C. It was found that a die temperature of 160 °C was necessary to achieve 90 % inactivation of Trypsin Inhibitor activity, a common standard for full-fat soy flours. ^ In addition, operating data from the prototype mini-extruder was collected. It was found that adjustment of the soybean feed moisture content had a linear effect on die temperature in the extruder, due to increased friction and shear in the extruder. Oil removal using a <b>perforated</b> <b>die</b> was shown to increase at higher temperatures, with a maximum removal of 58 % at 165 °C. ^ A study of rheological characteristics of soy within the extruder was also performed. The upper operating limit of apparent viscosity in the extruder was approximately 3900 Pa*s. By this observation, a method for achieving operating temperatures above 145 °C was developed, wherein the extruder is preheated with soybeans of 8 - 9 % moisture content. While running, the feed material is transitioned to soybeans of 6 - 7 % moisture content, normally too viscous to cold-start in an extruder. The maximum stable operating temperature using this method was 165 °C. Shear rate within the extruder was shown to be heavily dependent on soy moisture and oil contents. ...|$|R

40|$|AimTo {{evaluate}} risk factors, {{morbidity and}} mortality rates of perforated peptic ulcer (PPU) and to investigate factors affecting postoperative complications of PPU. BackgroundThe incidence of PPU has remained constant, simple closure with omental patch repair being the mainstay of treatment. Patients and MethodsOne hundred and nineteen patients admitted to Al-Ain Hospital with PPU between January 2000 and March 2004 was studied retrospectively; two with deficient data {{were excluded from the}} analysis. Logistic regression was used to define factors affecting postoperative complications. ResultsThe mean age of patients was 35. 3 years (range, 20 – 65). 45. 7 % of patients were Bangladeshi, and 85. 3 % originated from the Indian subcontinent. One patient, subsequently found to have a <b>perforated</b> gastric cancer, <b>died.</b> In 116 patients, 26 complications were recorded in 20 patients (17. 2 %). Common risk factors for perforation were smoking, history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). A significantly increased risk of perforation was evident during the daytime fasting month of Ramadan. An increase in the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score (p = 0. 047) and a reduced white blood cell count (0. 04) were highly significant for the prediction of postoperative complications. ConclusionPatients with dyspeptic symptoms and a history of previous PUD should be considered for prophylactic treatment to prevent ulcer recurrence during prolonged daytime fasting in Ramadan, especially during the winter time...|$|R
