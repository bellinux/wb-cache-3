5|$|On March 16, 2003, GSN {{was allowed}} to air the episodes, {{including}} a few previously edited-out portions, {{as part of a}} two-hour documentary called Big Bucks: The <b>Press</b> <b>Your</b> Luck Scandal, hosted and narrated by Tomarken. The documentary was produced by and aired on GSN (in association with Lionsgate and FremantleMedia, the latter of which now owns the rights to <b>Press</b> <b>Your</b> Luck), and broke all previous viewership records for the network. The Big Bucks documentary included additional footage, directly from the original master tapes, that had been edited out of the episodes for their initial broadcast. The original telecast was dedicated to the memory of Bill Carruthers, producer/creator of <b>Press</b> <b>Your</b> Luck, who had died before the airing.|$|E
5|$|A biopic {{was planned}} in 2000 with Bill Murray to portray Larson, but fell through. Larson's {{performance}} on <b>Press</b> <b>Your</b> Luck {{was featured in}} a July 2010 broadcast of This American Life.|$|E
5|$|After <b>Press</b> <b>Your</b> Luck, Larson {{became an}} {{assistant}} manager at local Walmart stores in Dayton, Lebanon, Xenia and Bellbrook, Ohio. He also ran a promotions and marketing company, Group Dynamics Downline, {{out of his}} Lebanon home.|$|E

5|$|Each {{episode of}} <b>Press</b> <b>Your</b> Luck was thirty minutes {{in length and}} prior to Larson's appearance, the series had never needed to {{straddle}} games or stop during play as a match would always be completed within the allotted time frame.|$|E
5|$|After the {{broadcast}} of Larson's two episodes, CBS suppressed the episodes for 19 years, {{as both the}} network and Carruthers at that time considered the incident {{to be one of}} their biggest embarrassments. When USA Network (and later, GSN) bought the rights to rerun <b>Press</b> <b>Your</b> Luck, CBS and Carruthers insisted that the Larson episodes must not be aired.|$|E
5|$|In May 1984, Larson {{used most}} of his savings to fly to Los Angeles to {{audition}} for <b>Press</b> <b>Your</b> Luck. Contestant supervisor Bobby Edwards was suspicious of Larson's motives when he interviewed Larson on May 19, and was unwilling to allow him on the show, but executive producer Bill Carruthers overruled him, a move he said he later regretted. Larson was added as a contestant on the fourth episode of the taping session, intended to air Friday, June 8, 1984.|$|E
6000|$|... 'God knows,' said Redgauntlet, in much agitation, 'I acted for {{the best}} when I <b>pressed</b> <b>your</b> Majesty to come hither--I never thought that your Majesty, at such a crisis, would have scrupled, when a kingdom was in view, to {{sacrifice}} an attachment, which'-- ...|$|R

5|$|Originally from southwestern Ohio, Larson {{used his}} cash {{winnings}} for taxes {{and real estate}} investments. However, he also had problems with the law and was involved in illegal schemes. As a result, Larson lost all of his winnings within {{two years of the}} show's taping and moved to Florida, where he later died of throat cancer at the age of 49. Since his death in 1999, Larson's game has re-aired on TV at various times and inspired the 2003 Game Show Network documentary Big Bucks: The <b>Press</b> <b>Your</b> Luck Scandal.|$|E
5|$|When <b>Press</b> <b>Your</b> Luck {{returned}} after the weekend break, the episode {{started with the}} same freeze frame image. Tomarken (again chroma keyed over the image) then brought the viewers {{up to speed on}} what Friday's episode entailed, first by introducing Larson's opponents and then explaining what Larson had done so far, before the game resumed. Freeze frames were also used to lead {{into and out of the}} first two commercial breaks, with voice overs by Tomarken leading into and out of them.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay {{remained}} largely similar to <b>Press</b> <b>Your</b> Luck, with contestants accumulating cash and prizes {{and attempting to}} avoid landing on a Whammy, who took away the winnings of any contestant who landed on it. At {{the start of the}} game, each of the three contestants was spotted $1,000 and took turns taking one spin at a time on the board. After each cycle of spins, additional Whammies were added to the board replacing cash values or prizes, and contestants chose to spin again or freeze with their score at that point. Landing on a Whammy in round one reduced that contestant's score to $0 and eliminated that contestant from further play in the round. Play continued until all three contestants froze or hit a Whammy. Cash values ranged from $100–$1,500 in round one, and prizes of similar values also appeared.|$|E
6000|$|A loose, slack, not well-dressed youth met Mr. ---- {{and myself}} in a lane near Highgate.---- knew him, and spoke. It was Keats. He was {{introduced}} to me, and staid a minute or so. After he had left us a little way, {{he came back and}} said: [...] "Let me carry away the memory, Coleridge, of having <b>pressed</b> <b>your</b> hand!"--"There is death in that hand," [...] I said to ----, when Keats was gone; yet this was, I believe, before the consumption showed itself distinctly.|$|R

5|$|In his eighties, Nielsen {{performed}} serious roles {{on screen}} and stage (such as his one-man theatre show Darrow, {{in which he}} played Clarence Darrow), {{as well as providing}} voice-overs and appearances for commercials; cartoons like Zeroman where he had the leading role/voice; children's shows, such as Pumper Pups, which he narrated, in addition to comedic film roles. The sibling relationship with his elder brother, the Honourable Erik Nielsen, a former Deputy Prime Minister of Canada, served as the premise of an HBO mockumentary entitled The Canadian Conspiracy in which Leslie Nielsen appeared, along with other prominent Canadian-born media personalities. He was a celebrity contestant on CBS's Gameshow Marathon, where he played The Price Is Right, Let's Make a Deal, Beat the Clock, and <b>Press</b> <b>Your</b> Luck for charity.|$|E
5|$|Spins {{earned in}} this round could be {{passed to the}} {{opponent}} with the higher total (if they were tied, the contestant passing the spins could choose the recipient). Contestants were required to use all spins passed until they used their spins or hit a Whammy; in the latter case, any remaining passed spins were transferred to their earned spin total. If a contestant using passed spins hit a space that awarded a spin (e.g., $3,000 + One Spin), that spin {{was added to the}} earned total. The contestant in the lead {{at the end of the}} game kept any cash and/or prizes in their bank at that time. Unlike <b>Press</b> <b>Your</b> Luck, three new contestants appeared on each episode.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, {{a massive}} change in both {{leadership}} and programming {{at the network}} took place. Liberty Media acquired a 50% stake in the network and changed its leadership. President Michael Fleming and vice president Jake Tauber were both fired and former Fox Family Channel president Rich Cronin were hired to head the network. He and incoming vice president Bob Boden began the biggest original programming venture since the network's inception, launching Whammy! The All-New <b>Press</b> <b>Your</b> Luck, Friend or Foe?, Russian Roulette, Lingo, WinTuition and Cram. In addition, {{in the fall of}} 2001, the network acquired the rights to air the classic <b>Press</b> <b>Your</b> Luck (excluding the Michael Larson episodes, due to pressure from CBS; this angered many fans, resulting in CBS eventually giving Game Show Network the rights to the Larson episodes, airing them in a separate package, as well as in conjunction with the documentary Big Bucks: The <b>Press</b> <b>Your</b> Luck Scandal).|$|E
25|$|To date, The Edge of Night is {{the last}} regularly-scheduled ABC network program to have aired in the 4:00-4:30p.m. (Eastern Time) time slot; ABC {{returned}} the half-hour slot to its affiliates after The Edge of Night finished its run. NBC had done this in 1979, while CBS, which programmed the 4:00p.m. time slot with Body Language at the time The Edge of Night left the air, followed suit in September 1986 after cancelling <b>Press</b> <b>Your</b> Luck a month prior.|$|E

(a game {{based on the}} Prisoner's Dilemma), Russian Roulette, WinTuition, Cram, National Lampoon's Funny Money and Lingo (a Chuck Woolery-hosted revival of the 1987–88 Canadian format in which teams guess five-letter words in a combination of Jotto/Mastermind and bingo). The network produced six seasons of the show from 2002 to 2007.|$|E

25|$|From Fremantle, {{the network}} {{licenses}} Match Game (Rayburn), Family Feud (Karn, O'Hurley, and Harvey), Card Sharks (Perry and Eubanks), <b>Press</b> <b>Your</b> Luck, and Sale of the Century. GSN had licensed the entire Mark Goodson-Bill Todman library {{from its inception}} until March 2009 and has, in the past, also licensed Let's Make a Deal (another Fremantle property) for air on the network. Older versions of these shows are now aired on rival channel Buzzr, which is a sub-channel on many broadcast television stations in major cities.|$|E
500|$|Whammy! [...] {{made use}} of {{technological}} advances that had been developed since the original <b>Press</b> <b>Your</b> Luck ended its run in the 1980s. For example, the prizes and light patterns for each space on the Big Board were randomly generated using a personal computer, running at a speed of 200MHz. This resulted in {{a very large number}} of patterns for gameplay, which prevented memorization of patterns as Michael Larson did on <b>Press</b> <b>Your</b> Luck. Also, Whammies were animated in 3D computer graphics, rather than being hand-drawn as on <b>Press</b> <b>Your</b> Luck.|$|E
