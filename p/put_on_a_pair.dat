Cameo {{appearances}} were made by model Jesus Luz and in an alternative video by her daughter Lourdes. At the 2010 Grammy Awards, the song received a nomination in the Best Dance Recording category. The song {{was used as a}} closing for The MDNA Tour in which Madonna energetically danced in a glittery outfit, and at one point <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of headphones and pantomimed scratching records with colored cubes falling in the backdrop.|$|E
25|$|Took {{four hours}} to dress; and then it rained; ordered the tilbury and my umbrella, {{and drove to the}} fives' court; next to my tailors; put him off after two years tick; no bad fellow that Weston...broke three stay-laces and a buckle, tore the quarter of a pair of shoes, made so thin by O'Shaughnessy, in St. James's Street, that they were light as brown paper; what a pity they were lined with pink satin, and were quite the go; <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of Hoby's; over-did it in {{perfuming}} my handkerchief, and had to recommence de novo; could not please myself in tying my cravat; lost three quarters of an hour by that, tore two pairs of kid gloves in putting them hastily on; was obliged to go gently to work with the third; lost another quarter of an hour by this; drove off furiously in my chariot but had to return for my splendid snuff-box, as I knew that I should eclipse the circle by it.|$|E
500|$|The next {{match was}} the No Disqualification match between Big Show and Floyd Mayweather, Jr.. Early in the match, Mayweather {{repeatedly}} escaped Big Show's grasp and delivered body shots to him. Mayweather and his accomplices tried to [...] "walk out" [...] of the match, but Big Show {{walked up the}} ramp and brought Mayweather back in the ring. As Big Show was about to chokeslam Mayweather, one of Mayweather's accomplices struck a steel chair on Big Show's back, and the latter chokeslammed him in retaliation. Capitalizing from this distraction, Mayweather grabbed that chair and hit Big Show multiple times {{on the head with}} it. Finally, Mayweather removed his right glove and <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of brass knuckles to hit Big Show in the face. As a result, Big Show was knocked out as he could not answer the referee's ten count, and Mayweather was declared the winner.|$|E

50|$|Hot Feet {{is about}} a {{beautiful}} young dancer whose dream is to dance on Broadway. When she <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of magical red shoes, they begin {{to take control of}} her fate. This story is a modern retelling of The Red Shoes, a fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen.|$|R
500|$|Both men {{are portrayed}} as very incompetent, in [...] "Nob and Nobility", it takes Prince George a week to <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of {{trousers}} by himself, eventually putting them on his head. George relies heavily on Blackadder in the third (Mr. E. Blackadder) series, even while Blackadder despises George for his immense wealth and complete inability to rectify problems in his life. While George is considered [...] "moronic" [...] and [...] "idiotic", he is helpful, loyal, and is aware he is not very intelligent, describing himself as [...] "thick as a whale omelette". In a 2008 retrospective, co-star Stephen Fry said George's keenness for self-improvement {{was one of the}} things he felt made the character likeable. In [...] "Duel and Duality," [...] the final episode of the third series, after a sexual encounter with the Duke of Wellington's nieces, this princely incarnation of George is struck by a point-blank shot from the vengeful Wellington's pistol and killed. George briefly awakes, believing that he may have a cigarillo case on him that deflected the blow, but when he realises that he must have left the case at home, promptly falls dead again in Baldrick's arms.|$|E
500|$|Orr {{was also}} known for his mean streak. Former coach Don Cherry recounts an {{incident}} one night in Los Angeles during a game that the Bruins were losing. With a minute to go, Orr pulled one of the Bruins off the ice, left the bench and attacked a Los Angeles Kings player. Asked why, Orr said to Cherry [...] "He was laughing at us." [...] According to Cherry, he fought a lot. On another occasion in November 1967, Orr was clipped in the face by a stick from the Toronto Maple Leafs' Brian Conacher. Boston teammate Johnny McKenzie flattened Conacher from behind and started punching Conacher. Orr, cut and bleeding, {{got up from the}} ice, pulled MacKenzie off Conacher and started punching Conacher. Conacher, who was not fighting back, was also sucker-punched by the Bruins' Ken Hodge. Orr would be booed in Toronto from that date onwards. Orr was frequently compared to Brad Park, who played a similar style to Orr and later succeeded Orr as Boston's top defenceman, and the two often fought each other on-ice, fueling the bitter rivalry between the Bruins and New York Rangers. Park said [...] "I saw no reason to be upset because I was rated second to Bobby Orr. After all, Orr not only was the top defenceman in the game but he was considered the best player ever to <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of skates. There was nothing insulting about being rated number two to such a super superstar".|$|E
2500|$|During {{his initial}} questioning, Hansen asked Parker {{if he had}} ever sent any mail to the Stanley family. After he responded negatively, Hansen {{produced}} the envelopes and handed them both to Parker. After pointing specifically to the second one, which {{was the one with}} the initials HLP in the upper left corner, Hansen asked if the envelopes had been sent by him or through the office and Parker responded by saying yes. A moment later, Parker decided to take a second look and <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of reading glasses. This time, he retracted his claim by pointing out the letters were printed by hand onto the envelope and then showed Collins and Hitch, who went along with him; when pressed a second time, Parker said the envelope had not come from him directly saying [...] "...'cause I don't write that way." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "The Red Shoes" [...] was {{released}} in April 1994 and made it to number 21 in the UK Singles Chart. The song is about <b>a</b> girl who <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of enchanted ballet slippers and can't stop dancing until she breaks the spell. It is inspired by a character in the Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger film The Red Shoes.|$|R

2500|$|In 1981, Blackwell {{auditioned for}} and was {{accepted}} into both the Houston Grand Opera and Lyric Opera of Chicago young artist programs. Having {{to choose between}} the two, Blackwell decided to go to Chicago. After singing with the company in small parts for a year, Blackwell left the program and moved back to New York to study vocal technique more intensely with Shirlee Emmons. She {{went on to win the}} Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions in 1983. Up to this point Blackwell was still uncertain as to whether she would continue pursuing an opera career or go back to musical theater. With winning the Met Auditions, however, her career path became decidedly reoriented towards opera. [...] "It fit so naturally", she explains of the then new foray into opera, [...] "it was as if I'd <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of old shoes." [...] Following her win, Blackwell continued in her apprenticeship at the Lyric Opera of Chicago for a year. In 1987 she made her Metropolitan Opera debut as Poussette in Manon. Since then Blackwell's career has flourished. She has appeared several more times with the Metropolitan Opera in productions such as Un ballo in maschera, Le nozze di Figaro, Die Fledermaus, and Werther among others.|$|E

50|$|In {{this version}} of the tale, Bush plays a {{frustrated}} singer-dancer who is enticed by a mysterious woman (Richardson) into <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of magical ballet slippers. Once on her feet, the shoes start dancing on their own, and Bush's character (who is never referred to by name) must battle Richardson's character to free herself from the spell of the shoes. Her guide on this strange journey is played by Kemp.|$|R
5000|$|Moon {{was partly}} {{distinguishable}} by his running style. Mark Ella wrote of Moon {{that he was}} ‘a beautiful runner’ and that, “Moon was a runner of the classical type. He had a high knee action and his arms pumped as he ran.” David Campese has asserted that, “His running style was especially impressive. He looked like a genuine track sprinter.” Rugby journalist Terry Smith once said of Moon’s running that, “With his fluent, graceful stride, it’s easy to imagine Brendan Moon <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of spikes and running for Australia in the Olympics." ...|$|R

60|$|Quite unmoved by this tender remark, Nan <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of large, round-eyed glasses, {{saying in}} a matter-of-fact tone: 'Now I see it. Only a splinter, and there it is.|$|E
60|$|With that he {{took his}} {{trembling}} hands, which were like the claws of a great bird, out of my hair; and <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of spectacles, not at all ornamental to his inflamed eyes.|$|E
50|$|Bodystockings are <b>put</b> <b>on</b> {{through the}} neck, {{in a similar}} {{technique}} to <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of tights: the body and arm sections are rolled down and then the legs are scrunched up like stockings; one would put one foot in and pull the stocking part up, and then the same on the other leg; from the waist, the bodystocking is pulled up over the torso to the chest, and then the arms are scrunched up and <b>put</b> <b>on</b> in {{same way as the}} legs; and the garment is then adjusted as required, and any ribbons and fasteners tied.|$|R

Without being able to see, each guest chooses a dinner partner according to their tactile impression.

60|$|However, I value it {{less as a}} work of {{art than}} as a fashion-plate. Miss d'Angeville <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of men's pantaloons to climb it, which was wise; but she cramped their utility by adding her petticoat, which was idiotic.|$|E
