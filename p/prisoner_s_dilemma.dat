Young and older adults tendencies to create conflict with the reciprocating partner and their defensive reactions to the selfish partner were examined. Although young adults outperformed older adults when playing the game on their own, they did not carry this performance advantage into the interactive rounds. In fact, despite their success when playing alone, young adults were no more successful than older adults when interacting with others.

40|$|Summary Three {{attempts}} to cooperate between the fighting groups in Angola have proven unsuccessful, resulting in continuing conflict. This {{indicates that the}} parties to the conflict find it difficult to agree on a peaceful solution that satisfies both, and it seems that the <b>prisoner</b> <b>s</b> <b>dilemma</b> is a recurrent problem. The three broken peace agreements and the long-lasting conflict in Angola lead me to the first statement: Natural resources such as oil and diamonds have been of major importance in sustaining the conflict in Angola {{since the end of the}} Cold War. Income from oil has been highly significant for the government army in financing warfare. International oil companies show a growing interest in Angola s oil, and their technology makes extraction of oil possible. According to the model I will present, low transparency and lack of reporting of the oil revenues could have an influence on the extent of the fighting when it was ongoing, as well as on risk for further conflict. The size of the oil and diamond reserves is decisive for the scope of the fighting. The two groups, FAA and UNITA, decide their fighting effort from their expectations of the size of the rent. If the oil companies started to publish their earnings from oil, it could be revealed that the rent is higher or lower than the fighting groups expect. A higher rent than expected will increase the fighting, whereas a lower will reduce its extent. The second hypothesis is motivated by recommendations by the IMF and others to increase the level of transparency to solve Angola s major problems of poverty and four decades of conflict. In my thesis, I investigate the following two hypotheses: : The presence of oil and diamonds makes it difficult for the two fighting groups, FAA and UNITA, to cooperate. : Increased transparency in oil revenue from reporting by oil companies of payments to the Angolan government will reduce the potential for further conflict. An approach by Mehlum & Moene (2002) is adapted to test if the two hypotheses hold. The conflict is modelled as a contest between the government and the rebel group over the resource rent. This game-theoretic model has been chosen because it appears to be applicable for conflict analysis. The approach has not been used for specific country analysis, and particularly not for the war in Angola. In both duopoly and civil war, there is competition between two parties to get the highest expected payoffs. In Angola, the conflict has been ongoing for four decades since both FAA and UNITA want to control the whole resource rent by governing the country. According to the model, the parties will end up in Nash-equilibrium in war if they follow their dominant strategies. Two broken peace agreements between the Angolan government and UNITA indicate that the parties find it difficult to cooperate, and this supports. The war ended without reaching a new peace agreement. It was a ceasefire agreement followed by dismantling of former UNITA forces that ended the war. This could be a sign of dissatisfaction within UNITA; maybe they were too weak to continue fighting. If the war ended without a peace agreement that satisfies both, it is likely not a lasting peaceful solution. A sharing of the rent that satisfies both is required to establish a long-lasting peace. That has not happened so far, so is not rejected. A third party, namely the oil companies, could possibly assist the country achieve lasting peace. They can influence the conflict through reporting their income from oil and the size of their investments in the oil sector. The oil companies activities may resolve the <b>prisoner</b> <b>s</b> <b>dilemma.</b> Increased transparency in oil revenue can either increase or decrease the risk for further fighting, depending on whether the numbers reveal higher or lower oil reserves than the belligerents expected. On the one hand, reducing the risk for further conflict seems unlikely if the reporting of oil revenue reveals that the rent is higher than FAA and UNITA expect. A high rent without a peace agreement that satisfies both can increase the risk for further conflict. On this basis, the test of my second hypothesis is uncertain. In the case that increased transparency reveals that rent is higher than expected, the hypothesis is rejected, since a higher rent will increase the extent of the fighting, according to the model. One may argue that since the payments from the oil companies to the government are kept secret, the rent is likely to be higher than the parties expect. This result is opposed to the recommendation of increased transparency in public finances by the IMF. Reasoning outside the model and from the viewpoint of the civilian population instead of the warlords, the results of increased transparency can differ. Angolans expectations of the oil reserves could be wrong. It is reasonable to assume that they have underestimated the oil reserves. Increased reporting of oil payments can change their expectations about the rent. If the reporting reveals a higher rent, the population could demand a higher share of the oil income. Then FAA and UNITA would have less to fight over. The risk for further conflict will be reduced, and poverty in the country could decrease if the people get their part of the oil income. Increased transparency could help sustain peace and establish the foundation for an equal distribution of income. It is, however, possible to argue that the oil companies and warlords could have benefited from war, since the extraction rate is likely to be higher than optimal and since transparency is low. For some groups, low-intensity war may be preferred to peace, since it is possible in wartime to capture more of the rent from oil and diamonds. The minority that can benefit from war is powerful, and of course the consequence is that the majority suffersa huge loss from war. If the warlords get higher expected profit from war than in peace, they can have a preference for conflict. One may say that in such a case the <b>prisoner</b> <b>s</b> <b>dilemma</b> exists for the majority only, but not for the groups that gain from war...|$|E

American television, which has become an increasingly powerful force, and which has a far larger audience than literature, offers its viewers more than 2 ̆ 2 mere 2 ̆ 2 entertainment; it offers, in both its form and content, a worldview that is characterized by isolated detachment, political and philosophical and metaphysical cynicism, and a narrow materialism. More than turning readers into viewers, television offers its viewers a worldview that is anti-literary. The present study, after defining that worldview by relying on the works of Neil Postman, Todd Gitlin, Mark Crispin Miller, Bill McKibben, and other cultural critics, analyzes three contemporary novels, Thomas Pynchon 2 ̆ 7 s Vineland, Don DeLillo 2 ̆ 7 s White Noise, and Richard Powers 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Prisoner</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Dilemma,</b> for both how they depict television and whether or not they offer alternatives to the televisual worldview.

So, we 2 ̆ 7 ll {{have to give up}} either our intuition that virtual murder is morally permissible-seemingly leaving us over-moralizing our gameplay-or our intuition that acts of virtual pedophilia are morally troubling-seemingly leaving us under-moralizing our game play. Bartel 2 ̆ 7 s attempted resolution relies on establishing the following three theses: (1) virtual pedophilia is child pornography, (2) the consumption of child pornography is morally wrong, and (3) virtual murder is not murder. Relying on Michael Rea 2 ̆ 7 s definition of pornography, I argue that we should reject thesis one, but since Bartel 2 ̆ 7 s moral argument in thesis two does not actually rely thesis one that his resolution is not thereby undermined. Still, even if we grant that there are adequate resources internal to Bartel 2 ̆ 7 s account to technically resolve the gamer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>dilemma</b> his reasoning is still unsatisfying. This is so because Bartel follows Neil Levy in arguing that virtual pedophilia is wrong because it harms women.

40|$|Bernard Williams 2 ̆ 7 s {{formulation}} of the Demandingness Objection holds that living a moral life, as the consequentialist understands it, is incompatible with living a life that is good for human beings. This is because the demands of consequentialist morality threaten to overwhelm {{the life of the}} person who cares about being moral, thus leaving no time for their own projects and interests. Several prominent consequentialists have responded to the Demandingness Objection by seeking a more moderate and indirect form of consequentialism that does not require as strong a duty of beneficence as classical utilitarianism. I review and criticize three prominent moderate forms of consequentialism: Brad Hooker 2 ̆ 7 s rule consequentialism; the theories of Samuel Scheffler and Tim Mulgan, which share an agent centered prerogative; and Liam Murphy 2 ̆ 7 s collective principle of beneficence. As the primary method of criticism, I develop a type of collective action problem, which I refer to as the Polluter 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Dilemma.</b> This dilemma occurs when a moral theory permits agents to favor their own interests and in doing so create a very small harm that affects all other agents. These small harms accumulate, and {{the result is that the}} long-term interests of all agents are greatly harmed.

When this game is treated from an evolutionary perspective, using the standard evolutionary model, we encounter a similar paradox: a population which cooperates through turn k can be invaded by a strategy which cooperates through turn k - 1, and this process continues until the population is dominated by defectors. However, though the strategy of continual defection is evolutionarily stable, it is inferior to nearly all other FRPD strategies: a bistable equilibrium occurs, in which a very small proportion of the other strategy can take over the population. Thus we propose and defend an alternative evolutionary model, a random invasion model in which 2 ̆ 7 evolutionary dominance 2 ̆ 7 is used instead of Maynard Smith 2 ̆ 7 s invasion criteria. This model combines the Lamarckian spread of ideas through a population with Darwinian natural selection of the organisms adopting those ideas, and thus is a more reasonable model of communicating populations. When the new evolutionary model {{is applied to the}} Finitely Repeated Prisoner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Dilemma,</b> we find that defectors dominate the population for very short FRPD games, but as game length increases, it becomes more and more certain that successful strategies will cooperate until {{near the end of the}} game. Defining rationality based on evolutionary fitness (or fictitious evolutionary play) using this model, we achieve a resolution to the Finitely Repeated Prisoner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Dilemma</b> paradox. Additionally, the model can be generalized and applied to many other decision situations, and thus it serves as a possible standard for rational decision-making under uncertainty. 2 ̆...|$|R

40|$|Social {{interactions}} {{presented by}} game theory allow researchers to investigate brain areas involved in cooperation and competition. The Prisoner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Dilemma</b> (PD) and Snowdrift (SD) are social dilemma {{games in which}} there are two players: each may choose to cooperate or defect. Defecting results in the maximum payoff, but if both players defect, they will receive fewer points than if they had both cooperated. Previous research has shown greater beta (12 - 24 Hz) activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) when participants defect. There is a greater general amount of activation related to defection. The DLPFC is associated with planning behaviors and may be involved in risk evaluation. Beta has been well-discussed, but alpha (8 - 12 Hz) has not been reported in terms of either cooperation or defection. Alpha is related to possible idling or neural efficiency mechanisms. We found that Snowdrift and Prisoner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Dilemma</b> produced similar activation via EEG, in that cooperation showed a decreased alpha desynchronization compared with defection. This may indicate mechanisms driving cooperation could have a basis in the neural efficiency hypothesis...|$|R

We find that Gaussian-distributed payoff variations are most successful in promoting cooperation irrespective of the temptation to defect. In particular, the facilitative effect of noise on the evolution of cooperation decreases steadily as the frequency of rare events increases. Findings are explained via an analysis of local payoff ranking violations. The relevance of results for economics and sociology is discussed...|$|R

Existing work asks how genes that code for cooperation arise and spread through a single-species population of IPD playing agents. In this paper, we focus on competition between different species of agents. Making this distinction allows us to separate and examine macroevolutionary phenomena. We illustrate with some species-level simulation experiments with agents that use well-known strategies, and with species of agents that use team strategies...|$|R
