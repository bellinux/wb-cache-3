This is true for oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and its close relative field mustard (Brassica rapa) in many regions of Europe [106]. Once herbicide resistance genes move into weeds, their frequency within local weed populations will increase under selection pressure by the corresponding herbicide. Hybrids {{do not need to be}} particularly fit as long as they are able to backcross with the weedy relative, a capacity which is characteristic for many interspecific hybrids.

40|$|Crop {{domestication}} {{has been}} embraced {{as a model}} system to study the genetics of plant evolution. Yet, {{the role of the}} environment, including biotic forces such as microbial and insect communities, in contributing to crop phenotypes under domestication and diversification has been poorly explored. In particular, there has been limited progress in understanding how human selection, agricultural cultivation (soil disturbance, fertilization, and irrigation), and biotic forces act as selective pressures on crop phenotypes. For example, geographically-structured pathogenic, pestiferous, and mutualistic interactions with crop plants have likely given rise to landraces that interact differently with local microbial and insect communities. In order to understand the adaptive role <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> traits, we argue that more studies should be conducted in the geographic centers of origin to test hypotheses on how abiotic, biotic, and human selective forces have shaped the phenotypes of domesticated plants during crop domestication and subsequent diversification into landraces. In these centers of origin, locally endemic species associated with wild ancestors have likely contributed to the selection on plant phenotypes.

Recent investigations have added identification of plant microremains (phytoliths, pollen, and starch grains), biochemical and molecular genetic approaches, and dating through 14 C accelerator mass spectrometry. We investigate {{the origin of}} domesticated chili pepper, Capsicum annuum, by combining two approaches, species distribution modeling and paleobiolinguistics, with microsatellite genetic data and archaeobotanical data. The combination of these four lines of evidence yields consensus models indicating that domestication of C. annuum could have occurred in {{one or both of}} two areas of Mexico: northeastern Mexico and central-east Mexico. Genetic evidence shows more support for the more northern location, but jointly all four lines of evidence support central-east Mexico, where preceramic macroremains of chili pepper have been recovered in the Valley of Tehuacán. Located just to the east of this valley is the center of phylogenetic diversity of Proto-Otomanguean, a language spoken in mid-Holocene times and the oldest protolanguage for which a word for chili pepper reconstructs based on historical linguistics. For many crops, especially those that do not have a strong archaeobotanical record or phylogeographic pattern, it is difficult to precisely identify the time and place of their origin.

40|$|A {{possible}} {{consequence of}} planting {{genetically modified organisms}} (GMOs) in centres <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> <b>origin</b> is unintended gene flow into traditional landraces. In 2001, a study reported {{the presence of the}} transgenic 35 S promoter in maize landraces sampled in 2000 from the Sierra Juarez of Oaxaca, Mexico. Analysis of a large sample taken from the same region in 2003 and 2004 could not confirm the existence of transgenes, thereby casting doubt on the earlier results. These two studies were based on different sampling and analytical procedures and are thus hard to compare. Here, we present new molecular data for this region that confirm the presence of transgenes in three of 23 localities sampled in 2001. Transgene sequences were not detected in samples taken in 2002 from nine localities, while directed samples taken in 2004 from two of the positive 2001 localities were again found to contain transgenic sequences. These findings suggest the persistence or re-introduction of transgenes up until 2004 in this area. We address variability in recombinant sequence detection by analyzing the consistency of current molecular assays. We also present theoretical results on the limitations of estimating the probability of transgene detection in samples taken from landraces. The inclusion of a limited number of female gametes and, more importantly, aggregated transgene distributions may significantly lower detection probabilities.

30|$|Intensive high-input {{farming is}} {{known as one of}} the main drivers of the {{continuous}} biodiversity loss in agricultural landscapes. Diversity and abundance of the weed flora provide relevant indicators for farmland biodiversity. While HR cropping facilitates weed control for farmers and makes chemical weed management more flexible, it is accompanied by increased herbicide use and less crop rotation. Toxic effects of the complimentary herbicides on non-target organisms, e.g. soil and aquatic organisms have been shown. Due to the widespread use of glyphosate, at least 34 glyphosate-resistant weed species have evolved worldwide. To counter resistance evolution in weeds, integrated weed management is recommended. But continuous and widespread HR cropping is still very common. The commercial trend is to develop new GM crops with stacked HR traits and GM varieties with increased glyphosate resistance. However, this approach will not reduce the overall herbicide amounts used in agriculture. Control problems can also arise due to HR volunteers or feral plants, e.g. HR oilseed rape. In centres <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> <b>origin</b> and regions where sexually compatible plants occur, transfer of HR genes to wild relatives can be expected. Biodiversity will be affected by HR cropping systems by the very efficient removal of weed plants which in turn leads to a further reduction of flora and fauna diversity and abundance. A prominent example in this respect may be the decline of monarch butterfly populations in the US which has been linked to the massive loss of their food plants upon widespread adoption <b>of</b> HR <b>crops.</b> Since it has been shown that HR systems are not compatible with measures to stop the loss of biodiversity on farmland, a more sustainable model of agriculture is needed, which, according to the present experience, cannot reasonably integrate approaches like HR cropping.|$|R

In contrast to many other regions, in Finland climate change could open new opportunities through enabling more diverse cropping systems. It is justified to re-enquire whether the extent and intensity <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> <b>crop</b> production are optimized, resources are used efficiently and sustainably, cropping systems are built to be resilient and whether ecological services that protein crops provide are utilized appropriately. This paper aims to analyze in a descriptive manner the biological grounds for sustainable intensification <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> <b>crop</b> production in Finland. Production security is considered by evaluating the effects of and likelihood for constraints typical for northern conditions, examining historical and recent crop failures and estimating ecosystem services that more extensive introduction <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> <b>crops</b> potentially provide for northern cropping systems now and in a changing climate. There is an evident potential to expand protein crop production sustainably {{to a couple of}} times its current area. In general, variability in protein yields tends to be higher for protein crops than spring cereals. Nevertheless, protein yield variability was not necessarily systematically higher for Finland, when compared with other European regions, as it was for cereals. Protein crops provide significant ecological services that further support their expanded production. By this means protein self-sufficiency remains unrealistic, but increased production <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> <b>crops</b> can be achieved. The expansion of rapeseed and legumes areas also seems to be economically feasible. From the economic viewpoint, an increase in domestic protein supply requires that farmers have economic incentives to a) cultivate protein-rich <b>crops</b> instead <b>of</b> cereals, and b) use them as animal feed instead of imported sources <b>of</b> <b>protein.</b> Environmental sustainability is an argument to justify economic support for protein-rich crops and thus increase their cultivation...|$|R

It operates through 21 - 24 nucleotides small RNAs which are processed through {{a set of}} core enzymatic machinery that involves Dicer and Argonaute proteins. In recent past, the technology has been well appreciated towards the control of plant pathogens and insects through suppression of key genes/proteins of infecting organisms. The genes encoding key enzymes/proteins with the great potential for developing an effective insect control by RNAi approach are actylcholinesterase, cytochrome P 450 enzymes, amino peptidase N, allatostatin, allatotropin, tryptophan oxygenase, arginine kinase, vacuolar ATPase, chitin synthase, glutathione-S-transferase, catalase, trehalose phosphate synthase, vitellogenin, hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, and hormone receptor genes.

The results showed that there are unique socio and ecological conditions in the Medak that do make the area an important and functioning region of {{in situ conservation}} efforts for many landrace crops. 1. Ecologically, the district is semi-arid with scarce rainfall and general soil nutrient unbalances, this renders many modern variety crops unsuitable allowing locally adapted landraces the default crop to be used. 2. Socio-economically, farmers are without financial means, therefore, much of the investments needed for agricultural modernisation is inaccessible to them i. e. synthetic pest management inputs, irrigation, land size, etc. The quantitative results showed that smallholding farmers conserve the most overall crop genetic diversity. This is understood for various reasons: 1. Little market integration characterised by direct on farm consumption <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> grown 2. Functioning and sprawled rural communities 3. Negative perceptions towards modern variety crops 4. Some limited institutional support 5. Functioning markets that demand local, landrace crops 6. Tradition.

This interpretation has {{had a profound effect}} on the biological framework within which investigations into <b>crop</b> <b>origins</b> have been carried out. A major underlying assumption has been that artificial selection pressures were substantially stronger than natural selection pressures, resulting in genetic patterns of diversity that reflect genetic independence of geographic localities. Recent archaeobotanical evidence has overturned the notion of a rapid transition, resulting in a protracted model that undermines these assumptions. Conclusions of genome-wide multilocus studies remain problematic in their support of a rapid-transition model by indicating that domesticated crops appear to be associated by monophyly with only a single geographic locality. Simulations presented here resolve this conflict, indicating that the results observed in such studies are inevitable over time at a rate that is largely influenced by the long-term population size. Counterintuitively, multiple <b>origin</b> <b>crops</b> are shown to be more likely to produce monophyletic clades than <b>crops</b> <b>of</b> a single <b>origin.</b> Under the protracted transition, the importance of the rise of the domestication syndrome becomes paramount in producing the patterns of genetic diversity from which <b>crop</b> <b>origins</b> may be deduced.

Complex study of specific diversity and analysis of geographic distribution of the habitats of oat forms and species confirmed that the centre of origin of Avena L. lies {{in the western part of}} the Mediterranean region, while the secondary centre of formation of Avena species and origin of cultivated oat (A. sativa) is situated within the Asia Minor centre <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> <b>origin.</b> The analysis <b>of</b> intraspecific diversity helped to identify centres of morphogenesis for all cultivated oat species. The centre for the diploid sp. A. strigosa is Spain and Portugal, for the naked forms A. nuda L. UK, for the tetraploid species A. abyssinica it is Ethiopia, for the hexaploid species A. byzantina Algeria and Morocco, for the hulled forms of A. sativa Iran, Georgia and Russia (Tatarstan), and for its hull-less forms Mongolia and China. A revised taxonomic system for the species in the genus Avena based upon the degree of relationship with hexaploid species has been developed. We have divided this genus into two subgenera, subgen. Avenastrum and a typical subgen. Avena which is subdivided into Aristulatae Malz. ? Denticulatae Malz. Such division according to the characters of the lemma tip - biaristulate or Aristulatae and bidentate or Denticulatae. The study was targeted at morhpological characterization, agronomic traits and resistance to the most widespread diseases: crown and stem rusts, powdery mildew, Helminthosporium leaf blotch, Septoria blight, Mirothecium necrotic mottle and BYDV. Representative collection of all species has been analyzed for groat protein content - amino acid and groat oil content - fatty acid content. The study representative set of accessions of genus Avena L. species with different ploidy levels helped to determine intraspecific diversity in all characters. A majority of identified sources may be directly involved in the breeding for disease resistance, agronomic traits and grain quality. Loskutov I. G. 2000. Proc. 6 -th Inter.

40|$|The {{physical}} characteristics of wool are important determinants of its spinning properties, yarn quality and end use. The {{degree to which}} wools from different countries of origin may be substituted {{has important implications for}} the domestic marketing policies of Australia and New Zealand. The hypothesis examined in this paper is that the differences in wool prices can be explained by differences in the {{physical characteristics}} of the wool and that objective measures of these characteristics allow for effective arbitrage between these markets. The alternative hypothesis is that premiums or discounts exist owing to country of origin. A hedonic price analysis was conducted on wool prices in Australia and New Zealand using a balanced sample of sale lot data from the 1986 - 87 selling season. In the year examined, {{there was no evidence of}} any price premiums associated with country <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> <b>Crop</b> Production/Industries, Marketing,...|$|R
40|$|Legumes are {{important}} food crops worldwide, contributing {{to more than}} 33 % <b>of</b> human dietary <b>protein.</b> The production <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> legumes is frequently impacted by abiotic and biotic stresses. It is therefore important to identify genes conferring resistance to biotic stresses and tolerance to abiotic stresses {{that can be used}} to both understand molecular mechanisms of plant response to the environment and to accelerate crop improvement. Recent advances in genomics offer a range of approaches such as the sequencing of genomes and transcriptomes, gene expression microarray as well as RNA-seq based gene expression profiling, and map-based cloning for the identification and isolation of biotic and abiotic stress-responsive genes in several crop legumes. These candidate stress associated genes should provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of stress tolerance and ultimately help to develop legume varieties with improved stress tolerance and productivity under adverse conditions. This review provides an overview on recent advances in the functional genomics <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> legumes that includes the discovery as well as validation of candidate genes...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The manurial {{utility of}} abundantly {{available}} lush green succulent biomass of Lantana camara was investigated through two waste management practices i. e. directly incorporated {{as well as}} composting in wheat crop. The compost was inoculated with Trichoderma viride and Azotobacter chroococcum cultures for rapid quality composting. Direct incorporation of green biomass and utilization as Lantana compost proved beneficial in improving grain and straw yields of wheat. Taking mean values of the yield of wheat obtained at four levels (N 0, N 60, N 90, N 120) of applied nitrogen {{it was observed that}} utilization of Lantana both as green matter and compost had significant effect on grain and straw yield in wheat crop over no Lantana. Grain and straw yields increased with increasing levels of nitrogen upto the level of 120 kg N/ha. Also, the incorporation of Lantana as green matter or compost increased the grain <b>protein</b> <b>of</b> wheat <b>crop.</b> Results <b>of</b> the studies brought out conclusively that the abundantly available green biomass of Lantana with exorbitant power of regeneration could be directly utilized as organic manure provided the crop rotation as well as the weather conditions permit the green matter to decompose for atleast twenty days before sowing <b>of</b> the next <b>crop.</b> Out <b>of</b> the two practices the utilization of Lantana as compost proved to be better.

40|$|Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia L.) is a nutritious {{vegetable}} <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> Asian <b>origin,</b> {{used as a}} {{medicinal herb}} in Indian and Chinese traditional medicine. Molecular breeding in bitter gourd is in its infancy, due to limited molecular resources, particularly on functional markers for traits such as gynoecy. We performed de novo transcriptome sequencing of bitter gourd using Illumina next-generation sequencer, from root, flower buds, stem and leaf samples of gynoecious line (Gy 323) and a monoecious line (DRAR 1). A total of 65, 540 transcripts for Gy 323 and 61, 490 for DRAR 1 were obtained. Comparisons revealed SNP and SSR variations between these lines and, identification of gene classes. Based on available transcripts we identified 80 WRKY transcription factors, several reported in responses to biotic and abiotic stresses; 56 ARF genes which play {{a pivotal role in}} auxin-regulated gene expression and development. The data presented will be useful in both functions studies and breeding programs in bitter gourd...|$|R
