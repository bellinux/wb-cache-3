2500|$|A {{court of}} inquiry convened in Wellington, New Zealand, {{published}} its findings on the sinking in a report dated 15 September 1930; the report was issued by the United Kingdom′s Board of Trade in London on 11 December 1930. The court found that the sinking resulted from a breakage of the starboard propeller shaft that not only punctured Tahiti′s hull at her stern, admitting water to her shaft tunnel – which the court deemed survivable – but also tore {{a hole in the}} bulkhead that divided the shaft tunnel from her engine room and No. 3 hold. The court found that the latter hole ultimately caused the ship to sink, as the increasing weight of water flooding the shaft tunnel widened the hole in the bulkhead despite the crew′s effort to contain the flooding and eventually overwhelmed their damage control efforts. The court found both the crew and officials who had certified the ship′s compliance with standards of seaworthiness blameless in the sinking, stated that the breaking of a propeller shaft was a common event at sea but the level of damage sustained by Tahiti in the breaking of her propeller shaft was exceedingly rare, and determined that Tahiti′s sinking was [...] "due to a <b>peril</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> which no reasonable human care or foresight could have avoided." ...|$|E

I remembered the two mates, the super-efficiency, mental and physical, of Mr. Mellaire and Mr. Pike--could they make this human wreckage do it? They, at least, evinced no doubts of their ability. The sea? If this feat of mastery were possible, then clear it was that I knew nothing of the sea.|$|E

It is associated with thoughts of exposure, hardship, and danger, to be sure, but undergone by men who ever with a frolic welcome take the tempest and the sunshine, and oppose mere hearts, free foreheads, and great as the risks may be, there is always a sense of security about a pilot-boat, because it is manned by those who are specialists in the <b>peril</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea,</b> who can detect the faintest premonition of a storm, and have weathered it out in the severest of gales. The eyes of the passengers who cross the ocean on the mammoth steamships arc strained, as they near the land, for the first glimpse of the tiny cockle-shell which bears the pilot, and when his foot strikes the deck of the great vessel, he is welcomed not only as a fresh-comer from the longed-for shore, but as the man of ability, to whom everything is entrusted. Nothing is too good for him. He is lord of all." ...|$|E

40|$|Analysis and {{presentation}} of this thesis {{is supported by}} studies of many relevant cases where the major arguments are set around the exclusion clauses concerning the ‘all risks cover’ policy as found in Institute Cargo Clauses. Two cases are especially emphasized, namely Mayban General Assurance BHD v. Alstom Power Plants Ltd. and Global Process Systems Inc v. Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Berhad, {{mainly because of the}} special nature of the subject matter insured in these cases. The legal issues arising from claims of loss during sea transportation of large technical equipments turn out to be complicated and might lead to different application of the law due to the special nature of the subject-matter insured. All risks insurance policies have many exclusion clauses expressly listed, however, most arguments about liabilities for damage to large equipments arise from application of these two clauses, namely inherent vice and improper or insufficient packaging. Inherent vice as well as insufficiency or improper packing are both exclusion clauses for insurer's liability under an all risk insurance policy. Different interpretation of the terms themselves might lead to different judgements regarding liability. Thus identifying the sources of such terms in different legislative works becomes very important. More often than not, the causes of such types of loss are complicated and involve mutual interaction between causes, and so it is necessary to discuss how the exclusion clauses are applied as well as their interactions. In practice, damage from inherent vice can and often will develop with the assistance of a fortuitous external circumstance such as harsh weather conditions which, if qualified as a <b>peril</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> and considered the sole proximate cause of the loss, could guarantee the insurance cover, even if inherent vice is an excluded clause in the all risks cover policy. It is very important to discuss the causational link between perils and losses, to identify the proximate causes to the loss and to discuss the insurance cover under situations where concurrent proximate causes of similar efficiency contribute to a loss. The purpose of this thesis is to make a presentation of these two exclusion clauses for ‘all risks’ insurance cover under British marine cargo insurance policy and discuss their application in previous cases. Frequent reference to the Marine Insurance Act 1906 and the Institute Cargo Clauses will be found in this thesis. There will also be found a discussion from perspectives of British maritime legislation, Norwegian maritime legislation, as well as Chinese Maritime legislation. At the end of this thesis, I’d like to enclose a simple legislative comparison between British marine cargo insurance and Chinese PICC insurance policy, through which a better understanding of different approaches for solutions under different jurisdiction will be gained...|$|E
