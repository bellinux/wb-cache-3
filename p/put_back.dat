She {{and the rest of}} the fleet sailed to {{intercept}} the British battleship , which was steaming to Alexandria, and a convoy sailing to Malta.

They <b>put</b> <b>back</b> in to Taranto on 1 September. Caio Duilio again put to sea on 7 September, in an attempt to catch the British Force H, but the Italian intelligence was faulty, as Force H was in the process of attacking Dakar.

5|$|The mint reopened as an assay {{office in}} 1876. Its {{machinery}} was evidently damaged during the war, {{but because of}} its importance, unlike the mints at Charlotte and Dahlonega, in 1877 U.S. Mint agent James R. Snowden asked the superintendent of the office, Dr. M. F. Bonzano, {{to report on the}} condition of the facility for minting. Upon receipt of Bonzano's report, new minting equipment was shipped to New Orleans.

He proceeds to walk around the house, while various things in the room he's in begin to explode around him, such as the bed and pictures in the bedroom, and various food and drink items in the kitchen. Near the end things begin going in reverse, and everything that had exploded is <b>put</b> <b>back</b> together. The video ends with Wade sitting back on the bed with his girlfriend now lying next to him.|$|E
