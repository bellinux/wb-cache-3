The <b>preheating</b> treatment of green compacts at 575 degrees C preserves their original shapes.

This study analyses the effect of in-process <b>preheating</b> on microstructure, mechanical properties and residual stresses during SLM of H 13 tool steel. Sample parts are produced without any <b>preheating</b> and are compared to the corresponding parts made with <b>preheating</b> at 100 °, 200 °, 300 °, and 400 °C. Interestingly, internal stresses at the top surface of the parts evolve from compressive (- 324 MPa) without <b>preheating</b> to tensile stresses (371 MPa) with <b>preheating</b> at 400 °C. Nevertheless, application of powder bed <b>preheating</b> results in a more homogeneous microstructure with better mechanical properties compared to H 13 SLM parts produced without <b>preheating.</b> The fine bainitic microstructure leads to hardness values of 650 - 700 Hv and ultimate tensile strength of 1965 MPa, which are comparable to or even better than those of conventionally made and heat treated H 13 tool steel...|$|R

25|$|First, {{a pattern}} {{is made from}} {{polystyrene}} foam, which {{can be done by}} many different ways. For small volume runs the pattern can be hand cut or machined from a solid block of foam; if the geometry is simple enough it can even be cut using a hot-wire foam cutter. If the volume is large, then the pattern can be mass-produced by a process similar to injection molding. Pre-expanded beads of polystyrene are injected into a <b>preheated</b> aluminum mold at low pressure. Steam is then applied to the polystyrene which causes it to expand more to fill the die. The final pattern is approximately 97.5% air and 2.5% polystyrene. Pre-made pouring basins, runners, and risers can be hot glued to the pattern to finish it.|$|E

40|$|Two potato cultivars {{representing}} extremes {{with regard}} to the texture of the cooked product were divided into subcategories based on size and dry matter (DM) content. The effects of the <b>preheating</b> temperature and time on both the instrumentally determined firmness and the sensory-perceived firmness were measured and compared. Increasing the <b>preheating</b> time at 60 C followed by cooking resulted in greater force required to fracture the tissue, an increase in perceived firmness, and a less mashable product. A principal component analysis showed that with higher DM contents of the potato samples, <b>preheating</b> resulted in a larger force required to fracture the tissue and a firmer product. The changes in fracture force were not linearly related with the changes in perceived firmness. The effects of <b>preheating</b> on the pectin methylesterase (PME) activity, the enzyme assumed to be responsible for the firming effect upon <b>preheating,</b> showed that the activity of this enzyme remained rather constant during <b>preheating</b> at 60 C for 1 h. <b>Preheating</b> at 78 C for 10 min abolished virtually all PME activity. To obtain insight into the consequences of <b>preheating</b> and <b>preheating</b> followed by steam cooking on the yield and composition of the cell wall material (CWM) of potatoes, a cell wall isolation followed by a pectin fractionation study was performed. Attention was also paid to the consequences of the processing conditions applied on the chemical composition of the CWM and the sequentially extracted pectic fractions. <b>Preheating</b> resulted in an increase in yield of the CWM of cooked potatoes and, as a consequence, all of the sequentially extracted fractions, including the residue. <b>Preheating</b> did not have a pronounced effect on the composition of the pectin of the sequentially extracted fractions. This altogether strongly indicates that <b>preheating</b> causes a PME-based firming effect, resulting in an decrease in pectin degradation and, as a consequence, a larger yield of CWM. It seems reasonable to assume that this increase in amount of CWM results in a firmer texture. The contribution of starch-based degradation products to the texture after <b>preheating</b> can, however, not be excluded...|$|R

25|$|This {{method of}} {{detonation}} produces energies over 100keV (~109 K temperatures), suitable {{not only for}} nuclear fusion, but other higher-order quantum reactions as well. The UTIAS explosive-driven-implosion facility was used to produce stable, centered and focused hemispherical implosions to generate neutrons from D–D reactions. The simplest and most direct method proved {{to be in a}} predetonated stoichiometric mixture of deuterium and oxygen. The other successful method was using a miniature Voitenko-type compressor, where a plane diaphragm was driven by the implosion wave into a secondary small spherical cavity that contained pure deuterium gas at one atmosphere. In brief, PETN solid explosive is used to form a hemispherical shell (3–6mm thick) in a 20-cm diameter hemispherical cavity milled in a massive steel chamber. The remaining volume is filled with a stoichiometric mixture of (H2 or D2 and O2). This mixture is detonated by a very short thin exploding wire located at the geometric center. The arrival of the detonation wave at the spherical surface instantly and simultaneously fires the explosive liner. The detonation wave in the explosive liner hits the metal cavity, reflects, and implodes on the <b>preheated</b> burnt gases, focuses {{at the center of the}} hemisphere (50microseconds after the initiation of the exploding wire) and reflects, leaving behind a very small pocket (1mm) of extremely high-temperature, high-pressure and high-density plasma.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} bosonic trilinear interactions in <b>preheating</b> after chaotic inflation. A trilinear interaction term allows for the complete decay of the massive inflaton particles, which {{is necessary for the}} transition to radiation domination. We found that typically the trilinear term is subdominant during early stages of <b>preheating,</b> but it actually amplifies parametric resonance driven by the four-legs interaction. In cases where the trilinear term does dominate during <b>preheating,</b> the process occurs through periodic tachyonic amplifications with resonance effects, which is so effective that <b>preheating</b> completes within a few inflaton oscillations. We develop an analytic theory of this process, which we call tachyonic resonance. We also study numerically the influence of trilinear interactions on the dynamics after <b>preheating.</b> The trilinear term eventually comes to dominate after <b>preheating,</b> leading to faster rescattering and thermalization than could occur without it. Finally, we {{investigate the}} role of non-renormalizable interaction terms during <b>preheating.</b> We find that if they are present they generally dominate (while still in a controllable regime) in chaotic inflation models. <b>Preheating</b> due to these terms proceeds through a modified form of tachyonic resonance.

40|$|We {{consider}} a curvaton {{scenario in which}} the late-time domination and the generation of the curvature perturbation is achieved by a non-oscillatory (NO) curvaton potential. Instead of considering the conventional curvaton oscillation, we consider ``weak trapping'' after <b>preheating,</b> which modifies {{the evolution of the}} curvaton density after <b>preheating.</b> The primordial isocurvature perturbation related to the curvaton is once converted into the fluctuation of the number density of the <b>preheat</b> field through inhomogeneous <b>preheating.</b> Then the evolution of the curvatons and the <b>preheat</b> field is controlled by the preheat-field number density. The density of these fields decreases slightly slower than the standard matter density which suggests that these fields will grow with time. Finally, the <b>preheat</b> field decays to reheat the Universe leaving behind the curvature perturbation. In our scenario the task of the standard curvaton is not executed solely by the curvaton itself but is partially shared with the <b>preheat</b> field.
