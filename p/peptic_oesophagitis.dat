40|$|Fifty-one adult {{patients}} with complaints suggesting <b>peptic</b> <b>oesophagitis</b> were submitted {{within the same}} week to a radionuclide swallow test (OT), an endoscopy and a manometry in order to evaluate the incidence of oesophageal peristaltic abnormalities in {{patients with}} only minor <b>peptic</b> <b>oesophagitis.</b> In all patients with normal endoscopy, OT did not show any transit abnormality. In the patients with slight (Stage I) or moderate (Stage II) oesophagitis, OT was abnormal in 60 % of the cases. The results were at least as good as those obtained by means of manometry and suggest that OT is an accurate method {{for the detection of}} slight impairment of oesophageal contractility. © 1989 Chapman and Hall Ltd.

40|$|Thirty three {{children}} aged 2 to 42 months (mean 9 months) with gastro-oesophageal reflux and <b>peptic</b> <b>oesophagitis</b> {{took part in}} a treatment trial comparing cimetidine (20 mg/kg/day) with an intensive regimen of antacids (Maalox, 700 mmol (mEq) / 1 X 73 m 2 /day). All children were evaluated clinically and by radiology, acid reflux test, and endoscopy. After 12 weeks of treatment all were again evaluated clinically, by pH measurement, and endoscopy. Twenty nine children, 15 on antacid and 14 on cimetidine, completed the trial. Eight patients on antacid and seven on cimetidine were cured; five on antacid and six on cimetidine improved; and two patients on antacid and one on cimetidine underwent surgery. Both groups of children showed a statistically significant reduction in the score of clinical, pH, and endoscopic variables after treatment. Lower oesophageal sphincter pressure before treatment did not correlate significantly with the final total score. Antacids in large quantities are as effective as cimetidine in medical treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux and <b>peptic</b> <b>oesophagitis...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{endoscopic}} {{diagnosis of}} hiatal hernia (sliding type) relies on {{direct and indirect}} criteria during the oesophagoscopic or gastroscopic approach. A wide separation between the anatomic and mucosal oesophago-gastric junction, {{the presence of a}} so-called Schatzki-ring, a wandering junction with sliding gastric mucosal folds during inspiration and two ring-like structures are important. Whereas radiology seems to be superior to endoscopy in the diagnosis of asymptomatic hiatus hernia, oesophagoscopy may reveal sequelae of reflux like oesophagitis, erosions, ulcers and strictures. <b>Peptic</b> <b>oesophagitis</b> is found in about 10 % to cause upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage...|$|E

40|$|Stress is {{purported to}} be a major cause of non-ulcer {{dyspepsia}}, defined here as dyspepsia where <b>peptic</b> ulcer, <b>oesophagitis,</b> and cancer are excluded by endoscopy. There is a subgroup of non-ulcer dyspepsia patients who have no definite cause for their dyspepsia, provisionally termed essential dyspepsia. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine if stress, as measured by major life events, was associated with essential dyspepsia. The frequency of life events during the year before the diagnosis of essential dyspepsia in 68 consecutive patients was compared with the frequency of these events over the same time period in 68 randomly selected age and sex-matched community controls. The mean number of events and the associated life change and distress scores were similar for both groups. Concerning individual events, patients reported more minor personal illness (p = 0. 008). When events were broadly categorised, only one difference was found - more controls reported bereavements (p = 0. 008). Age, sex, social class, and the duration of dyspepsia did not influence the number and nature of events. Although the study suggests that stress, as measured by major life events, is not associated with dyspepsia of unknown cause, it does not exclude the fact that other forms of stress, especially that associated with chronic difficulties, may be relevant...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The {{feasibility}} of conducting postmarketing drug surveillance by record linkage in Tayside was assessed. The key {{feature of the}} method is that all hospital discharge data are already computerised by the area health board and may be accessed through the unique community health number (CHNo) which has been allocated to all Tayside residents. The 12 861 prescriptions for cimetidine dispensed in Tayside over a nine month period were collected and the CHNo identified for 76 %. These corresponded to 3802 individuals and their discharge data, together with those for {{an equal number of}} controls matched by age, sex, and general practitioner were retrieved from the computer. The expected excess of those diseases for which cimetidine is prescribed (<b>peptic</b> ulcer and <b>oesophagitis)</b> was observed. Other drug-disease associations were observed but may have been due to confounding and emphasise the inadequacy of community based controls. The major advantages of record linkage are, firstly, the low cost of the method, the present study costing just over £ 12 000, and, secondly, the duration of patient follow up which may may be extended for as many years as required simply by rerunning the computer programs. To assemble large patient cohorts the study would have to be extended to other area health boards that are currently developing similar computer systems.

40|$|Background: Dyspepsia and {{irritable}} bowel syndrome (IBS) {{are common}} in Western populations. Aim: To determine the epidemiology of dyspepsia and IBS in China. Methods: A representative sample of 18 000 adults from five regions of China {{were asked to complete}} the modified Rome II questionnaire; 20 % were asked to complete the 36 -item Short Form Health Survey (SF- 36). Participants from Shanghai were invited to provide blood samples and undergo oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were determined using a multivariate logistic regression model. Results: The survey was completed by 16 091 individuals (response rate: 89. 4 %). Overall, 387 participants (2. 4 %) had dyspepsia and 735 (4. 6 %) had IBS. All SF- 36 dimension scores were at least five points lower in individuals with than without dyspepsia or IBS (P ≤ 0. 001). In Shanghai, 1030 (32. 7 %) of the 3153 respondents agreed to endoscopy; neither dyspepsia nor IBS was found to be associated with reflux <b>oesophagitis,</b> <b>peptic</b> ulcer disease or Helicobacter pylori infection. Conclusions: Prevalence estimates for dyspepsia and IBS in China are lower than in Western populations. In China, dyspepsia or IBS symptoms are generally not associated with underlying organic disease. Y. Zhao, D. Zou, R. Wang, X. Ma, X. Yan, X. Man, L. Gao, J. Fang, H. Yan, X. Kang, P. Yin, Y. Hao, Q.

40|$|Twenty {{children}} (age range 75 days- 47 months) with {{reflux oesophagitis}} entered a random double blind trial {{in which they}} received either Cisapride (Janssen Pharmaceutical Ltd), a new prokinetic agent, or an identical placebo syrup. Diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux was made by measurement of intraluminal oesophageal pH combined with manometry. Oesophagitis was assessed in all patients by histological examination of mucosal specimens taken during oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. Manometry, pH test, and endoscopy with biopsy examination were repeated {{at the end of}} the treatment period. Seventeen patients completed the trial, eight of whom were taking the drug and nine the placebo. Mean total clinical score and post-prandial reflux time (% of reflux) significantly improved in patients in the group given Cisapride but not in the group given placebo. Furthermore, there was a significant improvement of the histological oesophagitis score only in the children in the group given Cisapride, whereas placebo was ineffective.

40|$|One hundred {{cases of}} benign {{stricture}} of the oesophagus treated {{over a period}} of 11 years from 1960 to 1971 under the care of the senior author (D. M. M.) at Frenchay Hospital Thoracic Unit are reviewed. The results indicate that the commonest site of the lesion is in the lower third of the oesophagus and that the commonest cause is <b>peptic</b> <b>oesophagitis</b> due to gastric reflux and associated hiatus hernia. As the disease is commoner in the elderly a conservative medical regimen of dilatation, antacids, and posturing is recommended as the first line of treatment. When this fails surgery is necessary. Collis (1965) managed 69 patients by gastroplasty. Belsey (1965) reported his experience with colon transplants, while Brain (1967) and Allison (1970) advised jejunal transplantation. Our experience has shown that in view of the old age and often poor physical condition of these patients resection of the stricture and oesophagogastric anastomosis is a relatively safe and simple procedure. The results obtained indicate that 25 % of patients operated on will require future dilatations.

40|$|In this paper, a Working Group on Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux {{discusses}} {{recommendations for}} the first line diagnostic and therapeutic approach of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in infants and children. All members of the Working Group agreed that infants with uncomplicated gastro-oesophageal reflux can be safely treated before performing (expensive and often unnecessary) complementary investigations. However, the latter are mandatory if symptoms persist despite appropriate treatment. Oesophageal pH monitoring of long duration (18 - 24 h) is recommended as the investigation technique of choice in infants and children with atypical presentations of gastro-oesophageal reflux. Upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy in a specialised centre is the technique of choice in infants and children presenting with symptoms suggestive of <b>peptic</b> <b>oesophagitis.</b> Prokinetics, still a relatively new drug family, have already obtained a definitive place {{in the treatment of}} gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in infants and children, especially if "non-drug" treatment (positional therapy, dietary recommendations, etc.) was unsuccessful.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Life-threatening {{bleeding}} due {{to early}} spontaneous slippage of rubber bands {{have been described}} after variceal ligation in cirrhotic patients. Aims: To determine the predictive factors of this complication in cirrhotic patients. Methods: Among 605 patients, 21 patients (mean age 56. 6 ± 13. 5 years) developed 23 spontaneous band slippages with bleeding on postbanding ulcer, as confirmed by endoscopy. Cirrhosis was alcoholic in 13 patients (62 %), post viral hepatitis in 3 (14 %) and from other causes in 5 (24 %). A case-control study was performed comparing 17 from these patients who presented the complication after a first ligation with 84 of the 584 controls who underwent first endoscopic variceal ligation without bleeding complication. Results: Bleeding occurred 13. 5 days ± 7. 3 [2 - 29] following ligation. Eleven patients died following the bleeding complication (52 %). Using a multivariate analysis, previous upper variceal digestive bleeding (OR 12. 07, 95 %CI [2. 3 - 63. 43]), <b>peptic</b> <b>oesophagitis</b> (OR 8. 9, 95 %CI [1. 65 - 47. 8]), high APRI score (OR 1. 54, 95 %CI [1. 11 - 2. 16]) and low prothrombin index (OR 0. 54, 95 % CI [0. 31 - 0. 94]) were independent predictive factors of bleeding. Conclusions: Bleeding related to postbanding ulcer is a rare but severe complication. The proposed predictive factors should be looked for and minimized before variceal ligation...|$|E
40|$|Retrograde {{flow from}} the stomach into the {{oesophagus}} in infants and children is prevented by the mucosal choke and muscle cuff of the normally located oesophageal vestibule (Chrispin, Friedland, and Wright, 1967). When a hiatal hernia is present the cardinal functional abnormality is the retrograde flow of gastric content into the oesophagus. An analysis of the factors permitting such flow in these patients is presented in this paper. The important anatomical features are (1) {{the location of the}} oesophageal vestibule in the thorax, (2) the phreno-oesophageal membrane with its attachment to both the diaphragm and the vestibule, and (3) the size of the hiatus in the diaphragm. When the oesophageal vestibule lies entirely in the thorax its whole length lies in a zone of subatmospheric pressure. The sharp falls of intrathoracic pressure associated with crying are related to opening of the vestibule. Reduction in tension in the muscle cuff following a dry swallow may also result in vestibular opening with retrograde flow. Inefficient secondary stripping waves may fail to empty the refluxed gastric content from the oesophagus, permitting <b>peptic</b> <b>oesophagitis</b> to develop. The increased tendency to open and the increased difficulty in closing the oesophageal vestibule, because of tension in the abnormally located phreno-oesophageal membrane, are considered. The paradox of free retrograde flow with a small hernia and small retrograde flow with a large hernia is resolved. Basic radiological criteria for establishing the diagnosis of hiatal hernia in this age group are given. The objectives of surgery and the means by which they may be achieved are discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a case-control study in five general {{hospitals in the}} region of Antwerp, studying 161 patients (102 men, 59 women) and hospital control subjects matched for age and sex to explore the relation between drug use and upper gastrointestinal bleeding from 'erosive lesions' (<b>peptic</b> <b>oesophagitis,</b> gastric erosions, gastric ulcer(s), or duodenal ulcer(s]. There was a highly significant difference between cases and control subjects in the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, excluding aspirin) (odds ratio 7. 4, p less than 0. 001; 95 % confidence interval odds ratio 3. 7 to 14. 7). There also was {{a significant difference in the}} use of aspirin (odds ratio 2. 2, p = 0. 025; 95 % CI odds ratio 1. 3 to 4. 0) and a highly significant difference regarding the presence of antecedents of peptic ulcer disease (odds ratio 5. 5, p less than 0. 001; 95 % CI odds ratio 3. 2 to 9. 6). There was no significant difference in the use of other drugs, paracetamol and corticosteroids in particular, nor in the use of alcohol or tobacco. The patient group using NSAIDs was older, had more women, and had a higher mortality than the group not using NSAIDs. Among patients with bleeding gastric or duodenal ulcer(s), NSAID users were not more or less likely to have had symptoms of peptic ulcer disease, and had no higher frequency of multiple gastric or duodenal ulcers. The attributable risk for NSAID use was 0. 30 (95 % CI 0. 23 to 0. 37) and for aspirin use 0. 14 (95 % CI 0. 08 to 0. 20) ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: To date, {{very few}} studies have {{evaluated}} the risk of infection among spouses of Helicobacter pylori positive patients and their results are conflicting. AIM: To assess the seroprevalence of H pylori infection in spouse of H pylori positive patients with duodenal ulcer as compared with age and sex matched volunteer blood donors, {{as well as the}} frequency of endoscopic gastroduodenal lesions in these spouses, according to {{the presence or absence of}} gastrointestinal complaints. METHODS: Some 124 spouses (48 % males) of patients with duodenal ulcer consecutively seen over a 10 month period were studied. They were all screened for serum IgG anti-H pylori antibodies and asked to complete a questionnaire with particular reference to the presence of chronic or recurrent dyspepsia. Upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy with antral and corpus biopsy specimens taken for histological examination and urease rapid test was offered to all seropositive spouses. Volunteer blood donors (248), living in Milan and matched for age, sex, north-south origins, and socioeconomic status to the cases, were used as controls. RESULTS: Spouses of patients with duodenal ulcer had a significantly higher seroprevalence of H pylori infection than controls (71 % v 58 %, p < 0. 05); 30 of 88 (34 %) H pylori positive spouses complained of dyspeptic symptoms compared with only four of 34 (12 %) seronegative spouses (p < 0. 02). At endoscopy, H pylori infection was confirmed in 48 of 49 (98 %) seropositive spouses. The endoscopic findings in those spouses showed active duodenal ulcer in eight (17 %), duodenal scar and cap deformity in two (4 %), active gastric ulcer in two (4 %), erosive duodenitis in three (6 %), antral erosions in two (4 %), antral erosions plus duodenitis in one, and <b>peptic</b> <b>oesophagitis</b> in another patient. The prevalence of major endoscopic lesions was significantly higher in symptomatic spouses than in those who had never been symptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that being the spouse of an H pylori positive patient with duodenal ulcer may increase the risk of H pylori colonisation and perhaps of peptic ulcer disease, and raises questions as to whether serological screening of cohabiting partners of H pylori positive patients with duodenal ulcer may be indicated...|$|E
40|$|HP testing must be {{regarded}} as ONE of the important elements of the proper diagnostic work-up of a DISEASE, managed in close cooperation between GP's and specialists": that's the key message of the national consensus meeting held in CHU Brugmann on February 6 th and 7 th 1998. HP testing (usually by 2 direct methods: RUT-histology) and eradication treatment (ER), in infected patients, are strongly recommended in: 1. Past or current GDU (absolute indication), regardless of activity, complication(s), NSAID intake; 2. Low-grade MALT Lymphomas (Stage IE 1) unequivocally diagnosed, managed and followed-up in specialised centers; 3. Post endoscopic resection of EGC. ER is advisable in HP carriers with {{a family history of}} gastric cancer. Chronic atrophic-, lymphocytic-, giant folds gastritis and hyperplastic polyps are acceptable indications for ER as well as scheduled long-term NSAID treatment in individuals with known HP status. Systematic ER in HP+ patients with fully investigated NUD is not indicated but could be considered in individual patients. Extra alimentary disorders and auto immune gastritis are no indication and there was no consensus for a "test and treat" policy in patients under 45 yrs old without alarm symptoms. Systematic screening of asymptomatic individuals is not recommended. A correct monitoring of eradication after treatment is recommended, mainly by UBT. In severe or refractory PUD, symptom recurrence and follow-up of EGC and Maltomas, endoscopic follow-up with HP testing is mandatory. The recommended first line treatment course (except known allergy or intolerance) is PPI full dose bid, Clarithromycin 500 mg bid Amoxycillin 1000 mg bid (7 days minimal 10 days maximal). RBC-based schemes must be locally validated and quadruple therapy is proposed when retreatment is needed. Culture, optional after the first treatment failure, is strongly recommended after a second failure. Overall, ER therapies are safe and neither the decreased efficacy of acid-lowering drugs, nor the possible increased risk of <b>peptic</b> <b>oesophagitis</b> are considered as contra-indications to eradicate. ER is cost-effective and cost-beneficial in PUD and adjusted number of pills delivered would cut costs. No clear economic data are currently available for a potential benefit of ER in GC prevention or NUD management. A national monitoring of HP resistance (Macrolides and Imidazoles) must be organized by specialised centers. status: publishe...|$|E
