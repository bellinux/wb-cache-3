It also reduces costs for broken shares, beams and other parts. The fast resetting action also helps produce a better job of plowing since large areas of unplowed land are not left as when lifting a plow over a stone.|$|E

The automatic reset design has only recently been introduced on American plows, but has been used extensively on European and Australian plows. In this construction the beam is hinged at a point nearly above the point of the share. The bottom is held in the normal position by a set of springs or by a hydraulic cylinder on each bottom.|$|E

5000|$|Thus, James Oliver's chilled <b>plow</b> <b>bottom</b> {{became a}} {{practical}} success and on July 22, 1868, the Oliver's business was incorporated as the South Bend Iron Works. In 1871, the company sold 1,500 plows per year. By 1874 this figure had increased to 17,000 plows a year. At {{the time of}} death of James Oliver in 1908, the company had again changed names to the Oliver Chilled Plow Works. and their factory site in South Bend, Indiana covered 58 acre with 25 of those acres under roof. In January 1885, the plant's mostly Polish workers went on strike in protest of cuts to wages and hours in response to a glut of stock. Veterans of the Civil War with fixed bayonets finally ejected the strikers from the premises. The ownership considered leaving South Bend {{in the wake of the}} destruction of parts of the plant, with newspapers stating that they feared [...] "the Socialistic influences operating among the foreign elements at South Bend...probably emanating from Chicago." [...] Upon the death of his father in 1908, Joseph D. Oliver, the only son of James and Susan (Doty) Oliver took over the management of the Oliver Chilled Plow Works. By 1910, the company was manufacturing a wide variety of farm tillage implements in addition to the chilled plow. Production had reached the point that, in 1910, the company purchased over 40,000 tons of pig iron, alone.|$|E
5000|$|The {{business}} {{called the}} Oliver Chilled Plow Works {{was established by}} James Oliver in 1853. [...] James Oliver first settled in Mishawaka, Indiana in 1836 where he worked in a local foundry business. Later he bought into an already existing small foundry in South Bend, Indiana. Plows with cast iron bottoms and moldboards had been successfully used by farmers and planters in the eastern states of the United States {{since the time of}} Thomas Jefferson. [...] However, in the sticky soils of North Dakota and various other portions of the Midwest, the cast iron plows would not [...] "scour"; that is, the sticky soil would cling to the plow, disrupting the flow of soil over the plow's surface, making plowing impossible. Thus, when settlement of North America moved over the Allegheny Mountains into the Midwest, there was a real need for a new plow that would scour in the soils of the Midwest. To allow a cast iron bottom to scour in sticky soil, various methods of heat treating for creating a hardened surface on the metal <b>plow</b> <b>bottom</b> had been attempted. All of these processes failed because the hard surface created was very thin and would soon wear through to the soft iron under the heat-treated surface. James Oliver developed his sand casting process to include rapid chilling of the molten iron near the outside surface of the casting, which resulted in a bottom that had a thick hardened surface with far greater wearability than competing plow bottoms.|$|E
5000|$|Another problem {{common to}} cast iron plow bottoms {{was the lack}} of {{soundness}} and uniformity in the metal's molecular structure, which meant that some cast iron bottoms would have soft spots in the hardened surface, reducing the wearability of the <b>plow</b> <b>bottom.</b> Improvements made by James Oliver to his casting process overcame this problem also. Consequently, on June 30, 1857, James Oliver obtained his first patent from the United States government for his chilled plow shares and in February 1869, he obtained another patent for his process. What Oliver accomplished by this invention is sometimes referred to as chill hardening, or simply chilling. The purpose of chilling, whether it be a plowpoint or a wheel for a railroad car, is to produce an extremely hard and durable exterior of the object. This is done by including [...] "chills", pieces of metal, into the sand mold, such that when the molten iron is poured into the mould, the portion next to the chill cools rapidly, hardening in a way akin to quenching. This chilled area forms the exterior of the plowpoint. This metal cools more quickly than the metal which forms the other portion of the plowshare, and effectively becomes case hardened. Also, the vapors which arise as the molten metal comes in contract with the mould are expelled through a spout. Had these vapors been trapped in the mould, they would have caused impurities and would have weakened the plowpoint at the place where it should have been the hardest. To harden the plowpoints, Oliver arranged his moulding apparatus in such manner that the surface of the chill was in a position so that the melted metal first came into contact with the chill {{at the edge of the}} plowshare. This insured a hard plow cutting point.|$|E

5000|$|All modern baleen whales or mysticetes are filter-feeders {{which have}} baleen {{in place of}} teeth, though the exact means by which baleen is used differs among species (gulp-feeding within balaenopterids, skim-feeding within balaenids, and <b>bottom</b> <b>plowing</b> within eschrichtiids). the first members of both groups {{appeared}} during the middle Miocene. Filter feeding is very beneficial as it allows baleen whales to efficiently gain huge energy resources, which makes the large body size in modern variety possible. The development of filter feeding {{may have been a}} result of worldwide environmental change and physical changes in the oceans. A large-scale change in ocean current and temperature could have contributed to the radiation of modern mysticetes. The earlier variety of baleen whales, or [...] "archaeomysticetes", such as Janjucetus and Mammalodon had very little baleen and relied mainly on their teeth.|$|R
