40|$|For {{a method}} for {{operating}} a gripping device using electrostatic forces, in which a <b>potential</b> <b>difference</b> is generated for a gripping operation between electrodes of an electrode pair arranged in a gripping element (1, 11) of the gripping device, it is proposed that, in order to deposit a gripped article, the absolute value, between the electrodes, of the <b>potential</b> <b>difference</b> is reduced {{and in the process}} the sign of the <b>potential</b> <b>difference</b> is changed at least once.

25|$|<b>Potential</b> <b>differences</b> between {{pool water}} and railings, or shower {{facilities}} and grounded drain pipes {{are not uncommon}} {{as a result of}} neutral to earth voltages (NEV), and can be a major nuisance, but are usually not life-threatening. However, contact voltage resulting from damaged insulation on a current carrying conductor can be very dangerous, and can lead to shock or electrocution. Such a condition can arise spontaneously from mechanical, thermal, or chemical stress on insulation materials, or from unintentional damage from digging activity, freeze-frost seizing, corrosion and collapse of conduit, or even workmanship issues.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} detect weakly {{electric}} fields, animals must possess electroreceptors (receptive organs) that detect electric <b>potential</b> <b>differences.</b> For electric fishes, receptive organs are groups of sensory cells rooted in epidermal pits, which look like small {{spots on the}} skin. In each receptive organ, there are sensory cells embedded {{in the bottom of}} the opened [...] "pit" [...] that faces outside. Electroreceptors detect electric signals by building up a potential difference between the outside environment and the fish body's internal environment. Current flow due to such potential difference further results in a receptor potential that is presynaptic to the sensory fibers. Finally, this receptor potential leads to action potential fired by sensory cells.|$|E

40|$|Measurements of the {{electric}} <b>potential</b> <b>difference</b> across the hyphal wall and the cell membrane were made on external hyphae of three species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Gigaspora margarita, Scutellospora calospora and Glomus coronatum and on germ tubes of Gi. margarita. The values of transmembrane electric <b>potential</b> <b>difference</b> recorded (∼– 40 mV) are less negative than those previously reported from hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi closely associated with roots and from filamentous fungi. The external hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi grown in soil had similar values of electric <b>potential</b> <b>difference</b> to those grown in soil-less culture, and to germ tubes. Thermodynamic calculations showed that despite these low values of electric <b>potential</b> <b>difference,</b> efficient high-affinity uptake of phosphate is possible. The transmembrane electric <b>potential</b> <b>difference</b> of germ tubes of Gi. margarita became more negative when plant root extract {{was added to the}} medium, showing {{for the first time that}} the early stages of interaction between plant and fungus occur via direct effects on the plasma membrane rather than via effects on gene expression.
