60|$|In {{the yard}} of yonder {{dwelling}} the scarlet berries {{of the mountain}} ash shine through a transparent casing of crystal, and the sable spruces and white pines, powdered and glittering with the frost, have assumed an icy brilliancy. The eaves of the house, the door knocker, the pickets of the fence, the honeysuckles and seringas, once the boast of summer, are all alike <b>polished,</b> <b>varnished,</b> and resplendent with their winter trappings, now gleaming in the last rays of the early sunset.|$|R

40|$|Nail {{specimens}} {{are being}} submitted with increased frequency to confirm {{a diagnosis of}} onychomycosis, diagnose an inflammatory dermatosis, or identify clues to an underlying neoplasm. Samples often {{are associated with a}} variety of lacquers (aka <b>polish,</b> <b>varnish,</b> enamel) or gels that may vary in their appearance. Some lacquers or gel polishes add challenges to maintaining an even plane of sectioning, obscure underlying findings, or separate from the nail in processing and be misinterpreted as terra firma. We review the histologic appearance of common lacquers and gel polishes so that dermatopathologists recognize these different presentations in clinical practice...|$|R
50|$|Since most powerheads are {{designed}} to use commercial ammunition, which is not designed to be used underwater, the ammunition used must be waterproofed. A coating of nail <b>polish</b> or <b>varnish</b> is commonly used around the primer and case mouth. For shotshells, a layer of rubber, such as a balloon, {{can be used to}} seal the crimped front of the shell.|$|R
60|$|The new {{governor}} found Grandfather's {{chair in the}} Province House. He was struck with its noble and stately aspect, but was of opinion that age and hard services had made it scarcely so fit for courtly company as when it stood in the Earl of Lincoln's hall. Wherefore, as Governor Belcher was fond of splendor, he employed a skilful artist to beautify the chair. This was done by <b>polishing</b> and <b>varnishing</b> it, and by gilding the carved work of the elbows, and likewise the oaken flowers of the back. The lion's head now shone like a veritable lump of gold. Finally Governor Belcher gave the chair a cushion of blue damask, with a rich golden fringe.|$|R
50|$|Denatonium also discourages {{consumption}} of harmful alcohols like methanol, and additives like ethylene glycol. Denatonium {{is used in}} rubbing alcohol as an inactive ingredient. It is also added to many kinds of harmful liquids including solvents (such as nail <b>polish</b> remover), paints, <b>varnishes,</b> toiletries and other personal care items, special nail polish for preventing nail biting, and various other household products. It is also added to less hazardous aerosol products (such as gas dusters) to discourage inhalant abuse of the volatile vapors.|$|R
5000|$|Furniture {{created in}} the Art Nouveau style was {{prominent}} from the late 19th century to {{the advent of the}} First World War. Unlike furniture made by the British Arts and Crafts movement, from which it emerged in stylistic respects, most Art Nouveau furniture was produced in factories by normal manufacturing techniques, which led to tensions with Arts and Crafts figures in England, who criticised continental Art Nouveau furniture for not being [...] "'honestly' constructed. [...] It also tended to be expensive, as a fine finish, usually <b>polished</b> or <b>varnished,</b> was regarded as essential, and continental designs were usually very complex, with curving shapes that were expensive to make. It by no means entirely replaced other styles of furniture, which continued to be popular, with Art Nouveau styles largely restricted to an expensive [...] "art furniture" [...] category. The style was named for Siegfried Bing's Maison de l'Art Nouveau gallery and shop in Paris, which opened in 1895, and in France and Belgium furniture designers took up the style with more enthusiasm than those of most countries.|$|R

60|$|November 22d.--I went {{on board}} the ship William Lapscott, lying in the river, yesterday, to take {{depositions}} in reference to a homicide committed in New York. I sat on a sofa in the cabin, and Mr. Wilding at a table, with his writing-materials before him, and the crew were summoned, one by one,--rough, piratical-looking fellows, contrasting strongly with the gewgaw cabin in which I received them. There is no such finery on land as in the cabin {{of one of these}} ships in the Liverpool trade, finished off with a complete panelling of rosewood, mahogany, and bird's-eye maple, <b>polished</b> and <b>varnished,</b> and gilded along the cornices and the edges of the panels. It is all a piece of elaborate cabinet-work; and one does not altogether see why it should be given to the gales, and the salt-sea atmosphere, to be tossed upon the waves, and occupied by a rude shipmaster in his dreadnaught clothes, when the fairest lady in the land has no such boudoir. A telltale compass hung beneath the skylight, and a clock was fastened near it, and ticked loudly. A stewardess, with the aspect of a woman at home, went {{in and out of the}} cabin, about her domestic calls. Through the cabin door (it being a house on deck) I could see the arrangement of the ship.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Objectives To {{assess the}} re-hardening {{potential}} of enamel matrix derivatives (EMD) and self-assembling peptides in vitro, hypothesizing that these materials {{may increase the}} mineralization of artificial carious lesions and improve hardness profiles. Material and Methods Forty-eight enamel samples were prepared from extracted bovine lower central incisors. After embedding and <b>polishing,</b> nail <b>varnish</b> was applied, leaving a defined test area. One third of this area {{was covered with a}} flowable composite (non-demineralized control). The remaining area was demineralized in an acidic buffer solution for 18 d to simulate a carious lesion. Half the demineralized area was then covered with composite (demineralized control), while the last third was left open for three test and one control treatments: (A) Application of enamel-matrix proteins (EMD - lyophilized protein fractions dissolved in acetic acid, Straumann), (B) self-assembling peptides (SAP, Curodont), or (C) amine fluoride solution (Am-F, GABA) for 5 min each. Untreated samples (D) served as control. After treatment, samples were immersed in artificial saliva for four weeks (remineralization phase) and microhardness (Knoop) depth profiles (25 - 300 µm) were obtained at sections. Two-way ANOVA was calculated to determine differences between the areas (re-hardening or softening). Results Decalcification resulted in significant softening of the subsurface enamel in all groups (A-D). A significant re-hardening up to 125 µm was observed in the EMD and SAP groups. Conclusions This study showed that EMD and SAP were able to improve the hardness profiles when applied to deep demineralized artificial lesions. However, {{further research is needed to}} verify and improve this observed effect...|$|R
40|$|Class ionomer cements are {{liable to}} {{hydration}} and dehydration during their initial set. The use of a light-activated bonding resin is advocated as a protective method of limiting water movement across the surface. This study tested the effect of five coating materials on the surface hardness of Ketac-Fil restorative glass ionomer. Cocoa butter (CB), Ketac varnish (KV), clear finger nail <b>polish</b> (NP), copalite <b>varnish</b> (CV), and a light-cured unfilled resin (UFR) were evaluated. The surface hardness of each group was determined at 1 hour, 24 hours and 1 week, and {{compared to that of}} unprotected surface as a control (C). The results showed none of the tested coatings was able to maintain the original surface hardness of the unprotected cement. CB, KV and NP were less effective in reducing the surface hardness of Ketac-Fil than CV and UFR. Corresponding Author: Dr. L. A.
