25|$|With current {{technology}} available, it {{is estimated}} that the cost of producing microalgal biomass is $2.95/kg for photobioreactors and $3.80/kg for open-ponds. These estimates assume that carbon dioxide is available at no cost. If the annual biomass production capacity is increased to 10,000 tonnes, the cost of production per kilogram reduces to roughly $0.47 and $0.60, respectively. Assuming that the biomass contains 30% oil by weight, the cost of biomass for providing a liter of oil would be approximately $1.40 ($5.30/gal) and $1.81 ($6.85/gal) for photobioreactors and raceways, respectively. Oil recovered from the lower cost biomass produced in photobioreactors is estimated to cost $2.80/L, assuming the recovery process contributes 50% to the cost of the final recovered oil. If existing algae projects can achieve biodiesel <b>production</b> <b>price</b> targets of less than $1 per gallon, the United States may realize its goal of replacing up to 20% of transport fuels by 2020 by using environmentally and economically sustainable fuels from algae production.|$|E
2500|$|Marx himself famously {{stated in}} chapter 9 of Capital, Volume III {{that he had}} {{previously}} assumed that, to the purchasing capitalist, {{the value of a}} commodity bought was equal to its cost-price. In reality, he argued, this cost-price is itself a market price based on a <b>production</b> <b>price</b> (a cost-price + a profit) of the supplying capitalist producer: the input purchasing price of one capitalist is the output selling price of another capitalist. So the acquisition cost-price of inputs itself corresponded to both a value and a surplus value, and the market prices of inputs might diverge from the labor-value of inputs. [...] Hence, said Marx, if the cost-price of a newly produced output is assumed to be equal to the labor-value of the inputs used up in producing it, [...] "it is always possible to go wrong" [...] in the calculation of the output <b>production</b> <b>price</b> (because input acquisition prices and input labor-values could diverge, given that inputs could be bought above or below their value, and given that their inventory value could change during the production process).|$|E

5000|$|Some writers {{argue that}} Marx's <b>production</b> <b>price</b> is similar, or {{performs}} the same theoretical function, as the [...] "natural prices" [...] of classical political economy found, for example, {{in the writings}} of Adam Smith and David Ricardo (though the concept of natural prices is much older). This is the orthodox Marxist view, based on quotations where Marx says that his concept of production prices recalls the classical idea of natural prices. In this case, Marx's <b>production</b> <b>price</b> would be essentially a [...] "centre of gravity" [...] around which prices for outputs in a competitive market will fluctuate in the long run (cf. Fred Moseley's view). This is an interpretation within the framework of equilibrium economics, which suggests that production prices are really a kind of [...] "equilibrium prices". It can be supported with some textual evidence, insofar as Marx sometimes defines the <b>production</b> <b>price</b> as the price that would apply if the supply and demand for products were balanced.
