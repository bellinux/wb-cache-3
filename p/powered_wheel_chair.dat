40|$|Abstract: A <b>powered</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> is a mobility-aided {{device for}} persons with moderate/severe {{physical}} disabilities or chronic diseases {{as well as the}} elderly. In order to take care for different disabilities, various kinds of interfaces have been developed for powered wheelchair control; such as joystick control, head control and sip-puff control. Many people with disabilities do not have the ability to control <b>powered</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> using the above mentioned interfaces. The proposed model is a possible alternative. In this paper, we use the optical-type eye tracking system to control <b>powered</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>chair.</b> User‘s eye movement are translated to screen position using the optical type eye tracking system. When user looks at appropriate angle, then computer input system will send command to the software based on the angle of rotation of pupil i. e., when user moves his eyes balls up (move forward), left (move left), right (move right) in all other cases wheel chair will stop. Once the image has been processed it moves onto the second part, our microprocessor. The microprocessor will take a USB output from the laptop and convert the signal into signals that will be sent to the wheelchair wheels for movement. Also, the pressure and object detection sensors will be connected to our microprocessor to provide necessary feedback for proper operation of the wheelchair system. The final part of the project is the wheelchair itself. The rear wheels will provide forward. The front two wheels will be used for steering left and right. All four wheels will be connected to our microprocessor that will send signals to control the wheels and thus the overall movement...|$|E

40|$|Runtime: 05 : 15 minutesMid-drive <b>power</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>chairs</b> (PWC) {{have become}} more popular in recent years. However, due to the {{placement}} of the front casters, the traditional side-mounted footrests have been replaced by a single center-mounted footrest. Unfortunately, center-mounted footrests do not have a lift/lower mechanism that is easily operable by certain PWC users who transfer independently. Many PWC users have limited trunk strength, limited range of motion, decreased sensitivity in their lower body, and lack of fine motor function. This causes difficulty reaching the footrest to raise it. There is a need for a design solution that allows PWC users to independently lift and lower the footrest...|$|R
40|$|While {{the impact}} of "human error" on {{failures}} of complex human-technology systems has widely been demonstrated and accepted, the relevance of situational and task-related characteristics on human performance {{has not yet been}} considered sufficiently. For this purpose and on the example of electrically <b>powered</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> control this paper analyzes the effects of situational characteristics (e. g., turns to the left/right in the backward/forward driving mode) on {{the impact of}} fine motor abilities on human performance. A study with 23 participants is described in the paper, during which relevant data such as the subjects' precision and aiming capacity, the number of collisions caused while driving as an indicator for human performance, and the situational characteristics were measured. The data analyses demonstrate an influence of especially the number of turns driven to the right in the backward mode on the impact of the precision ability on the number of safety-critical collisions. The results highlight the necessity not only to develop a wheelchair system which is adaptable to the user’s fine motor abilities, but also to the situational characteristics in order to increase the dependability of the human-technology system at hand...|$|E
40|$|Many {{products}} {{are designed to}} be hand operated in use. These extend from industrial machine tools to domestic appliances. In these the designer has to rely upon experience and ergonomic guidelines to ensure that the final product is comfortable, usable and not dangerous when in use. In order to aid in this problem a computer-based manikin has been created to investigate the posture of humans, which now incorporates the movements of the hand. This creates a number of difficulties, which extend from the large number of degrees of freedom to those of redundancy and interaction. In representing such hand movements within a modelling environment it is necessary to firstly understand the natural motions and to then represent then in a realistic manner. Whilst some of the responses are required to form contact with surfaces, to affect a grip or reaction, others are the responses arising from the interaction between the fingers. Other more complex actions require both combinations and sequences of grip actions to achieve the desired action. Many of these actions have been explored in order that the hands of the manikin can be instructed to undertake a range of activities extending from simply that of pointing at an object through to gripping, such as occurs when a manually <b>powered</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> is in use...|$|E

The wheelchair is divided into two categories based on the power used mobility: Manually powered wheelchair, electrically <b>powered</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>chair.</b> This project focuses on redesign of electrically driven wheelchair, which runs with electric power however joystick is required for manual operation to operate the movements of chair. The design of wheelchair happened by means of literature review to know its evaluation from past to present generation. Different methodologies have been proposed based on human anthropometric data and tested for sitting and lying as well as standing mechanism of the wheelchair to maximize the utility of chair by including features like back reclination and lifting of wheelchair [...] Wheelchairs are not only for those who have no use of their lower extremities, but also for those who tire out easily because of muscular and nerve degenerating conditions. This work is to provide ergonomic constraints for user’s maximum comfort while dealing with various body movements like sitting, lying and lifting. The final output is a wheelchair with very simple mechanism which gives the facility to lie down by reclining the chair backwards and lift upto the desired level with maximum upto standing height. Apart from this simple mechanism ergonomic constraints have been given so that patient can avoid large pressure on body parts allowing body flexibility...|$|E

While we need to detect and process the condition quickly and efficiently using sensors, they (sensors) introduce extra complexity to the systems. Therefore this paper aims to develop a new method to simplify the sensing process. It describes an experimental process for monitoring path conditions of a <b>power</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> inside and outside of the lab. The monitoring method triggers impedance via transduction matrix of the DC motors which run the wheelchair. The matrix is based on the relationship between electrical and mechanical impedance of the motors. A voltage probe and a current probe are used to monitor the changes of voltage and current supplied to the two DC motors of the system while the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> is moving and the signals are recorded by a Digital Signal Analyzer (DSA). The recorded data are processed by MATLAB and the graphs representing various conditions are plotted. The relationship between the conditions of the path and the changes of voltage, current, and impedance of the motors are listed. The use of the method is justified but miniaturization of the voltage and current probes is necessary for real-life implementation of the system...|$|R

40|$|The commercially {{available}} <b>wheel</b> <b>chairs</b> for amputees donot have the functionality for climbing staircases. In our project, we have designed a manually operated wheelchair that can travel on both plane terrains {{and also in}} the staircases. In our project, instead of using normal wheels we have used penta wheel. The steel rod is penta shaped and each rod is equally inclined of 72 ° from each other. At the time of climbing, one wheel that is the idle wheel will be in contact with the ground and the another wheel will be in contact with the stair. The motion takes place only when we pull the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> backwards towards the staircase. The main aim of our project is to provide stability to the person who travels in the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> (i. e., a large support base and maintain the overall centre of gravity as low as possible).

People with {{disability}} {{have to face}} a lot {{of problems}} in their day-to-day life due to the flexibility issues. One such issue is using the shopping cart in the grocery stores. Using shopping cart becomes very difficult, as they have to control the movement of the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> and shopping chair at the same time while placing the grocery in the shopping cart, which is an extra burden on the user. They would have to constantly control the movement of the cart, as there would be lot of obstacles in the store which becomes a very big problem for the user.
