5|$|In 2006 a triplet carbene was {{reported}} with a half-life of 40 minutes. This carbene is prepared by a <b>photochemical</b> decomposition of a diazomethane with expulsion of nitrogen gas at a wavelength of 300 nanometers in benzene.|$|E
5|$|Persistent {{triplet state}} carbenes have been {{prepared}} by <b>photochemical</b> decomposition of a diazomethane product via the expulsion of nitrogen gas, at a wavelength of 300nm in benzene.|$|E
5|$|BGSU {{offered the}} nation's first PhD program in <b>photochemical</b> {{science and the}} first Ph.D. program in applied philosophy. The college of Business {{recently}} opened a facility at Levis Commons in Perrysburg, Ohio for its Professional MBA program. BGSU opened a satellite campus offering MBA classes at Owens State Community College in Findlay, Ohio in January 2013.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{was still}} in Germany {{at the start of}} the First World War, and was interned in the Ruhleben {{internment}} camp near Berlin, where he was allowed to set up a laboratory in the stables and conduct scientific experiments using improvised materials such as radioactive toothpaste. With the help of Charles Drummond Ellis, he worked on the ionisation of phosphorus, and the <b>photochemical</b> reaction of carbon monoxide and chlorine. He was released after the Armistice with Germany came into effect in November 1918, and returned to his parents' home in Manchester, where he wrote up his findings over the previous four years for the 1851 Exhibition commissioners.|$|E
5|$|Kistiakowsky {{attended}} {{private schools}} in Kiev and Moscow until the Russian Revolution {{broke out in}} 1917. He then joined the anti-Communist White Army. In 1920 he escaped from Russia in a commandeered French ship. After spending time in Turkey and Yugoslavia, {{he made his way}} to Germany, where he enrolled at the University of Berlin later that year. In 1925, he earned his PhD in physical chemistry under the supervision of Max Bodenstein, writing his thesis on the <b>photochemical</b> decomposition of chlorine monoxide and ozone. He then became Bodenstein's graduate assistant. His first two published papers were elaborations of his thesis, co-written with Bodenstein.|$|E
5|$|Sulfuric acid is {{produced}} in the upper atmosphere by the Sun's <b>photochemical</b> action on carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and water vapour. Ultraviolet photons of wavelengths less than 169 nm can photodissociate carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide and atomic oxygen. Atomic oxygen is highly reactive; when it reacts with sulfur dioxide, a trace component of the Venusian atmosphere, the result is sulfur trioxide, which can combine with water vapour, another trace component of Venus's atmosphere, to yield sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|Trace {{amounts of}} ammonia, acetylene, ethane, propane, {{phosphine}} and methane {{have been detected}} in Saturn's atmosphere. The upper clouds are composed of ammonia crystals, while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH) or water. Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes methane photolysis in the upper atmosphere, leading {{to a series of}} hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by eddies and diffusion. This <b>photochemical</b> cycle is modulated by Saturn's annual seasonal cycle.|$|E
5|$|Conductive CVD diamond is {{a useful}} {{electrode}} under many circumstances. <b>Photochemical</b> methods {{have been developed for}} covalently linking DNA to the surface of polycrystalline diamond films produced through CVD. Such DNA modified films can be used for detecting various biomolecules, which would interact with DNA thereby changing electrical conductivity of the diamond film. In addition, diamonds can be used to detect redox reactions that cannot ordinarily be studied and in some cases degrade redox-reactive organic contaminants in water supplies. Because diamond is mechanically and chemically stable, it can be used as an electrode under conditions that would destroy traditional materials. As an electrode, synthetic diamond can be used in waste water treatment of organic effluents and the production of strong oxidants.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{biological}} possibilities, {{there are}} formidable obstacles {{to life on}} Titan, and any analogy to Earth is inexact. At a vast distance from the Sun, Titan is frigid, and its atmosphere lacks CO2. At Titan's surface, water exists only in solid form. Because of these difficulties, scientists such as Jonathan Lunine have viewed Titan less as a likely habitat for life, than as an experiment for examining theories on the conditions that prevailed prior to the appearance of life on Earth. Although life itself may not exist, the prebiotic conditions on Titan and the associated organic chemistry remain of great interest in understanding {{the early history of}} the terrestrial biosphere. Using Titan as a prebiotic experiment involves not only observation through spacecraft, but laboratory experiments, and chemical and <b>photochemical</b> modeling on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Due to lack {{of space}} at the University of Chicago, Spedding {{proposed}} to organise part of the Chemistry Division at Iowa State College in Ames, where he had colleagues {{who were willing to}} help. It was agreed that Spedding would spend half of each week in Ames, and half in Chicago. The first problem on the agenda was to find uranium for the nuclear reactor that Enrico Fermi was proposing to build. The only uranium metal available commercially was produced by the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, using a <b>photochemical</b> process that produced ingots the size of a quarter that were sold for around $20 per gram. Edward Creutz, the head of the group responsible for fabricating the uranium, wanted a metal sphere the size of an orange for his experiments. With Westinghouse's process, it would have cost $200,000 and taken a year to produce.|$|E
5|$|Franck's first paper there, co-authored with Edward Teller, was on <b>photochemical</b> {{processes}} in crystals. Hans Gaffron became his collaborator. They {{were joined by}} Pringsheim, who escaped from Belgium after the German invasion. Franck arranged a position for Pringsheim at his laboratory. Both his daughters and their families moved to the United States, {{and he was also}} able to bring out his elderly mother and aunt. He became a naturalised United States citizen on 21 July 1941, so he was not an enemy alien when the United States declared war on Germany on 11 December 1941. His daughters still were, though, so they were restricted from travelling, and could not take care of their mother when she fell ill and died on 10 January 1942, although they were permitted to attend her funeral.|$|E
5|$|Other human {{impacts on}} the {{atmosphere}} include the air pollution in cities, the pollutants including toxic chemicals like nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds and airborne particulate matter that produce <b>photochemical</b> smog and acid rain, and the chlorofluorocarbons that degrade the ozone layer. Anthropogenic particulates such as sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct irradiance and reflectance (albedo) of the Earth's surface. Known as global dimming, the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global water cycle by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{chemical}} processes use solar energy to drive chemical reactions. These processes offset energy {{that would otherwise}} come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and transportable fuels. Solar induced chemical reactions {{can be divided into}} thermochemical or <b>photochemical.</b> A variety of fuels can be produced by artificial photosynthesis. The multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon-based fuels (such as methanol) from reduction of carbon dioxide is challenging; a feasible alternative is hydrogen production from protons, though use of water as the source of electrons (as plants do) requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen. Some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by 2050 the splitting of sea water providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel-cell electric power plants and the pure water by-product going directly into the municipal water system. Another vision involves all human structures covering the earth's surface (i.e., roads, vehicles and buildings) doing photosynthesis more efficiently than plants.|$|E
25|$|In <b>photochemical</b> reactions, {{atoms and}} {{molecules}} absorb energy (photons) of the illumination light and convert into an excited state. They can then release this energy by breaking chemical bonds, thereby producing radicals. <b>Photochemical</b> reactions include hydrogenâ€“oxygen reactions, radical polymerization, chain reactions and rearrangement reactions.|$|E
25|$|Advances in <b>photochemical</b> technology, {{such as the}} lithographic and <b>photochemical</b> processes, {{have allowed}} for the {{creation}} of maps that have fine details, do not distort in shape and resist moisture and wear. This also eliminated the need for engraving which further shortened {{the time it takes to}} make and reproduce maps.|$|E
25|$|The {{total amount}} of ozone in the {{stratosphere}} is determined by a balance between <b>photochemical</b> production and recombination.|$|E
25|$|Particulates {{created from}} gaseous primary {{pollutants}} and compounds in <b>photochemical</b> smog. Smog {{is a kind}} of air pollution. Classic smog results from large amounts of coal burning in an area caused by a mixture of smoke and sulfur dioxide. Modern smog does not usually come from coal but from vehicular and industrial emissions that are acted on in the atmosphere by ultraviolet light from the sun to form secondary pollutants that also combine with the primary emissions to form <b>photochemical</b> smog.|$|E
25|$|Many {{important}} processes involve photochemistry. The premier {{example is}} photosynthesis, {{in which most}} plants use solar energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, disposing of oxygen as a side-product. Humans rely on photochemistry {{for the formation of}} vitamin D, and vision is initiated by a <b>photochemical</b> reaction of rhodopsin. In fireflies, an enzyme in the abdomen catalyzes a reaction that results in bioluminescence. Many significant <b>photochemical</b> reactions, such as ozone formation, occur in the Earth atmosphere and constitute atmospheric chemistry.|$|E
25|$|Cyclooctatetraene also {{undergoes}} rearrangement {{reactions to}} form aromatic ring systems. For instance, oxidation with aqueous mercury(II) sulfate forms phenylacetaldehyde and <b>photochemical</b> rearrangement of its mono-epoxide forms benzofuran.|$|E
25|$|Certain N-substituted azirines with {{electron}} withdrawing {{groups on}} both carbons form azomethine ylides in an electrocyclic thermal or <b>photochemical</b> ring-opening reaction. These ylides can be trapped with a suitable dipolarophile in a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D can be {{synthesized}} {{only by a}} <b>photochemical</b> process, so land vertebrates had to ingest {{foods that}} contained vitamin D or had {{to be exposed to}} sunlight to photosynthesize vitamin D in their skin to satisfy their vitamin D requirements.|$|E
25|$|Worldwide, {{the largest}} source of carbon {{monoxide}} is natural in origin, due to <b>photochemical</b> reactions in the troposphere that generate about 5 kilograms per year. Other natural sources of CO include volcanoes, forest fires, {{and other forms of}} combustion.|$|E
25|$|Daniele Barbaro {{described}} a diaphragm in 1566. Wilhelm Homberg described how light darkened some chemicals (<b>photochemical</b> effect) in 1694. The fiction book Giphantie, published in 1760, by French author Tiphaigne de la Roche, described {{what can be}} interpreted as photography.|$|E
25|$|The sand on Titan {{might have}} formed when liquid methane rained and eroded the ice bedrock, {{possibly}} {{in the form}} of flash floods. Alternatively, the sand could also have come from organic solids produced by <b>photochemical</b> reactions in Titan's atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Ammonium persulfate (APS) (N2H8S2O8; mW: 228.2) is {{a source}} of free {{radicals}} and is often used as an initiator for gel formation. An alternative source of free radicals is riboflavin, which generated free radicals in a <b>photochemical</b> reaction.|$|E
25|$|Microelectromechanical systems (or MEMS) {{barometers}} {{are extremely}} small devices between 1 and 100 micrometres in size (i.e. 0.001 to 0.1mm). They are created via photolithography or <b>photochemical</b> machining. Typical applications include miniaturized weather stations, electronic barometers and altimeters.|$|E
25|$|The {{main concern}} with {{gasoline}} on the environment, {{aside from the}} complications of its extraction and refining, is the potential effect on the climate through the production of carbon dioxide. Unburnt gasoline and evaporation from the tank, when in the atmosphere, reacts in sunlight to produce <b>photochemical</b> smog. Vapor pressure initially rises with some addition of ethanol to gasoline, but the increase is greatest at 10% by volume. At higher concentrations of ethanol above 10%, the vapor pressure of the blend starts to decrease. At a 10% ethanol by volume, the rise in vapor pressure may potentially increase the problem of <b>photochemical</b> smog. This rise in vapor pressure could be mitigated by increasing or decreasing the percentage of ethanol in the gasoline mixture.|$|E
25|$|The {{successful}} <b>photochemical</b> {{synthesis of}} krypton difluoride was first reported by Lucia V. Streng in 1963. It was next reported in 1975 by J. Slivnik. The <b>photochemical</b> {{process for the}} production of KrF2 involves the use of UV light and can produce under ideal circumstances 1.22g/h. The ideal wavelengths to use are in the range of 303â€“313nm. Harder UV radiation is detrimental to the production of KrF2. Using Pyrex glass or Vycor or quartz will significantly increase yield because they all block harder UV light. In a series of experiments performed by S. A Kinkead et al., it was shown that a quartz insert (UV cut off of 170nm) produced on average 158mg/h, Vycor 7913 (UV cut off of 210nm) produced on average 204mg/h and Pyrex 7740 (UV cut off of 280nm) produced on average 507mg/h. It is clear from these results that higher-energy ultraviolet light reduces the yield significantly. The ideal circumstances for the production KrF2 by a <b>photochemical</b> process appear to occur when krypton is a solid and fluorine is a liquid, which occur at 77K. The biggest problem with this method is that it requires the handling of liquid F2 and the potential of it being released if it becomes overpressurized.|$|E
25|$|To be sure, <b>photochemical</b> {{reactivity}} emerges {{when the}} internal conversion makes the system explore the nuclear configuration space such that new chemical species are formed. There is {{a plethora of}} femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopic techniques to reveal details of these processes occurring, for example, {{in the process of}} vision.|$|E
25|$|The {{generation}} of CIDNP {{in a typical}} <b>photochemical</b> system (target + photosensitizer, flavin in this example) is a cyclic <b>photochemical</b> process shown schematically in Figure 1. The chain of reactions is initiated by a blue light photon, which excites the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) photosensitizer to the singlet excited state. The fluorescence quantum yield of this state is rather low, and {{approximately half of the}} molecules undergo intersystem crossing into the long-lived triplet state. Triplet FMN has a remarkable electron affinity. If a molecule with a low ionization potential (e.g. phenols, polyaromatics) is present in the system, the diffusion-limited electron transfer reaction forms a spin-correlated triplet electron transfer state â€“ a radical pair. The actual kinetics are rather complicated and may involve multiple (de)protonations and hence exhibit pH dependence.|$|E
25|$|Incomplete {{combustion}} {{of petroleum}} or gasoline results in production of toxic byproducts. Too little oxygen results in carbon monoxide. Due {{to the high}} temperatures and high pressures involved, exhaust gases from gasoline combustion in car engines usually include nitrogen oxides which are responsible for creation of <b>photochemical</b> smog.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescence {{recovery}} after photobleaching (FRAP) is a <b>photochemical</b> process {{applied to}} fluorophores {{when they lose}} their fluorescent properties. It {{can be used to}} measure the viscosity and lateral diffusion of a lipid bilayer. It also rejuvenates the fluorescence of the fluorophore and monitors how long this process takes to occur overtime.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} {{atmospheric}} scientists at Stanford University found that E85 fuel {{would increase the}} risk of air pollution deaths relative to gasoline by 9% in Los Angeles, US: a very large, urban, car-based metropolis that is a worst-case scenario. Ozone levels are significantly increased, thereby increasing <b>photochemical</b> smog and aggravating medical problems such as asthma.|$|E
25|$|Air pollution: {{the release}} of {{chemicals}} and particulates into the atmosphere. Common gaseous pollutants include carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and nitrogen oxides produced by industry and motor vehicles. <b>Photochemical</b> ozone and smog are created as nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons react to sunlight. Particulate matter, or fine dust is characterized by their micrometre size PM10 to PM2.5.|$|E
25|$|Lasers {{can cause}} damage in {{biological}} tissues, {{both to the}} eye and to the skin, due to several mechanisms. Thermal damage, or burn, occurs when tissues are heated {{to the point where}} denaturation of proteins occurs. Another mechanism is <b>photochemical</b> damage, where light triggers chemical reactions in tissue. <b>Photochemical</b> damage occurs mostly with short-wavelength (blue and ultra-violet) light and can be accumulated over the course of hours. Laser pulses shorter than about 1 Î¼s can cause a rapid rise in temperature, resulting in explosive boiling of water. The shock wave from the explosion can subsequently cause damage relatively far away from the point of impact. Ultrashort pulses can also exhibit self-focusing in the transparent parts of the eye, leading to an increase of the damage potential compared to longer pulses with the same energy. Photoionization proved to be the main mechanism of radiation damage at the use of titanium-sapphire laser.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} harsh {{chemicals}} are usually highly reactive and oxidizing. <b>Photochemical</b> smog is therefore {{considered to be}} a problem of modern industrialization. It is present in all modern cities, but it is more common in cities with sunny, warm, dry climates and a large number of motor vehicles. Because it travels with the wind, it can affect sparsely populated areas as well.|$|E
