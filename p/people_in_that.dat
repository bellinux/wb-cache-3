5|$|Three cruise ships, Carnival Pride, Carnival Destiny, and Grandeur of the Seas had {{to alter}} their courses due to the {{presence}} of Bonnie. Due to the threat of a tropical storm, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal {{declared a state of emergency}} on July22. Along the Gulf Coast, concerns arose regarding the potential effects of the storm on the BP oil spill earlier in the year. Due to risk of intoxicated storm surge, authorities prepared for possible evacuations of low-lying areas along coastlines. On July23, Admiral Thad Allen ordered the oil spill site to be evacuated, as Bonnie posed a safety threat to nearly 2,000 <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> area. The ships and vessels in the area began preparation for evacuation on July24. Closer to shore, approximately 1,300 fishing boats laying boom had to evacuate.|$|E
5|$|The 1970 Bhola cyclone is {{the deadliest}} {{tropical}} cyclone on record, killing more than 300,000people and potentially {{as many as}} 1million after striking the densely populated Ganges Delta region of Bangladesh on November 13, 1970. Its powerful storm surge {{was responsible for the}} high death toll. The North Indian cyclone basin has historically been the deadliest basin. Elsewhere, Typhoon Nina killed nearly 100,000 in China in 1975 due to a 100-year flood that caused 62 dams including the Banqiao Dam to fail. The Great Hurricane of 1780 is the deadliest North Atlantic hurricane on record, killing about 22,000 people in the Lesser Antilles. A tropical cyclone {{does not need to be}} particularly strong to cause memorable damage, primarily if the deaths are from rainfall or mudslides. Tropical Storm Thelma in November 1991 killed thousands in the Philippines, although the strongest typhoon to ever make landfall on record was Typhoon Haiyan on November 2013, causing widespread devastation in Eastern Visayas and killing at least 6,300 <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> country alone. In 1982, the unnamed tropical depression that eventually became Hurricane Paul killed around 1,000people in Central America.|$|E

In terms of JTWC-estimated 1-minute sustained winds, Haiyan is tied with Meranti for being the strongest landfalling tropical cyclone on record. In January 2014, bodies were still being found.|$|E

25|$|At Kytmanovo in Russia between Mongolia and Kazakhstan, dated 1746–1626 BC, {{a strain}} of Yersinia pestis was {{extracted}} from a dead woman's tooth in a grave common to her and to two children. This strain's genes express flagellin, which triggers the human immune response. However, by contrast with other prehistoric Yersinia pestis bacteria, the strain does so weakly; later, historic plague does not express flagellin at all, accounting for its virulence. The Kytmanovo strain was therefore under selection toward becoming a plague (although {{it was not the}} plague). The three <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> grave all died at the same time, and the researcher believes that this para-plague is what killed them.|$|E
25|$|Some have {{referred}} to the conflict as a civil war, with other factors involved.

The superpowers avoided descending into an all-out war against one another, as well as the mutual use of nuclear weapons.

25|$|The {{last four}} named storms by PAGASA {{was from the}} last week of October until the mid-week of November. During late-October, Vinta made {{landfall}} over northern Luzon with little damages. As November came in, the PAGASA had monitored a weak Tropical Depression Wilma which had brought minor damages and a waterspout in southern Visayas. Later that week, Typhoon Haiyan entered the area as rapidly intensifying storm system with a fast-pace speed and was named Yolanda by PAGASA. The monstrous typhoon first made landfall over eastern Visayas at its peak strength of a pressure of 895 millibars, which is the strongest storm globally to make landfall at that intensity. Winds were recorded gusting up to 315km/h (195mph), with the storm producing a large storm surge which brought the death toll to nearly 7,000 <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> same country. Just like the formation of Bising during January, the last named storm, Zoraida, formed and impacted southern Philippines with hardly any deaths and damages. No storms formed after that from November through {{to the end of the}} year.|$|E
