40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Seventeen parental clones were selected, from 9, 000 plants, on {{the basis}} of self-sterility, seed and forage yield {{potential}} using phenotypic ratings, crude protein and chromogen content. The parental clones were divided into two populations based on date of maturity. Group I was intermediate in maturity and had nine parental clones, while group E was early maturing and had eight parental clones. Six progeny testing methods (vegetative cuttings of parental clones, first generation selfed-seed (S₁ progeny), open-pollinated progeny, <b>polycross</b> progeny, seed from all possible single crosses, and selfed seed from the single-crosses or F₂ progeny) were compared using simple correlation coefficients between the progeny test and by comparing the rankings of the clones {{on the basis}} of each progeny test. The actual <b>polycross</b> performance was compared with the theoretical <b>polycross</b> performance or average of all possible single crosses, to see if equal and random fertilization occurred in the actual <b>polycross.</b> The results from the comparison of the six progeny testing methods indicated the vegetative cuttings of the parental clones and the single-cross progeny tests are the two most effective progeny testing methods when considering all four traits and both populations of plants. The open pollinated and <b>polycross</b> progeny tests were generally undesirable, because frequently {{there was no significant difference}} among their progeny. The S₁ progeny test was generally not desirable in group I; however, it appeared to be the most satisfactory test for seed yield when both populations of plants were considered. The results illustrate why there are inconsistencies in the literature concerning the effectiveness of the progeny testing methods. The effectiveness of the six progeny tests varied, to some extent, from trait to trait and for the two populations. For all four traits there was much less agreement among the six progeny tests in group E than in group I. In all four traits the F₂ generation showed a great inbreeding depression. The average of the single crosses was lower than the parents for tiller number, plant height, and 100 seed weight, but equalled the parents in yield per plant. The S₁ progeny were usually approximately equal to the average of the single cross progeny. The open-pollinated and <b>polycross</b> progeny were generally the highest for all four traits. The results from the comparison of the actual <b>polycross</b> with the theoretical <b>polycross</b> indicated that equal and random fertilization did not occur in the actual <b>polycross.</b> The more desirable clones appeared to contribute the majority of the pollen, since the actual <b>polycross</b> performance was usually greater than the theoretical <b>polycross</b> performance...|$|E

Hence, organic farmers and scientists {{joined in a}} participatory breeding approach to develop region-specific genotypes of spring faba bean for organic conditions in Germany. A set of 49 genotypes with contrasting degrees of heterozygosity and heterogeneity was used in field trials across five locations in Germany during 3 years 2004, 2005 and 2006. The material involved 18 inbred lines, their 18 <b>polycross</b> progenies, one blend of inbred lines, one blend of <b>polycross</b> progenies, one blend of hybrids and ten checks. Inbred lines are uniform, thus giving the option to be specifically adapted; whereas the <b>polycross</b> progenies and synthetics (Syn- 1; predicted from the inbred lines and <b>polycross</b> progenies performance) are partly heterogeneous and heterozygous, thus giving the option to evolve. Agronomic performance was assessed and a ‘‘personal appreciation’’ score of the material was assigned to each genotype by each partner. This personal appreciation was strongly influenced by biotic and abiotic constraints faced by the crop in each location and by the expected grain yield of the genotypes. Uniformity was apparently appreciated by organic farmers. In all locations, the highest yielding inbred line yielded slightly better than the predicted highest yielding synthetic.

The parents and five progeny groups {{were included in the}} study: first generation selfed progeny (S₁), open-pollinated progeny, <b>polycross</b> progeny, single-cross progeny, and selfed progeny from the single-crosses (F₂). Each entry consisted of ten plants in a nine foot row, with three feet between rows. The plants were established in the field in October 1962, in a randomized block design with four replications. Data were collected during the summers of 1963, 1964, and 1965. Group E plants had slightly higher seed yields than group I plants. This yield advantage was mainly the result of heavier seeds in group E. The parents and the open-pollinated, <b>polycross,</b> and single-cross progeny were generally highest in performance for all four characteristics, while the S₁ progeny were intermediate and the F₂ progeny were lowest in performance. The open-pollinated and <b>polycross</b> progeny were limited in their usefulness for evaluating breeding material since {{there were no significant differences}} among the open-pollinated progenies in 13 of 24 analyses of variance and there were no significant differences among the <b>polycross</b> progenies in 12 of 24 analyses of variance. Six methods (regression of the S₁ progeny on the parents, two times the regression of the open-pollinated progeny on the parents, two times the regression of the <b>polycross</b> progeny on the parents, regression of the single-cross progeny on the mid-parents, regression of the F₂ progeny on the mid-parents, and mean squares from the diallel analysis) of estimating heritability were compared for both populations. There were large differences in the heritability estimates among years and among methods. Two methods, 2 ([superscript b][subscript OP. P]) and [superscript b][subscript SX.

The "average heritability" (averaged across six methods and three years) for tiller number, seed number, seed weight, and seed yield were. 187,. 371,. 506, and. 193 respectively for group E and. 567,. 417,. 622, and. 374 for group I. The correlation and path-coefficient analysis for groups E and I indicated that tiller number had the largest direct effect in 1963, while seed number was most important in 1964 and both were equally important in 1965. Seed weight had relatively small effects all three years. All indirect effects were minor in both populations.

However, the candivars developed by the methods B and C did not differ significantly. The candivars developed by these progressive methods were suitable for higher yielding and drier environment in Hladké Životice (where was the highest yield level even if averaged annual precipitation were lower by 73 and 113 [*]mm in comparison to other locations, respectively); here was ave­ra­ge yield higher by 19 and 13 % for B and C in comparison to A method. Highly significant interaction of the candivars with locations was found. It can be concluded that varieties specifically aimed to different locations by the methods B and C should be bred; also the parental entries should be selected there...|$|E

40|$|Selection at the {{seedling}} {{stage in}} forage grass breeding {{would be extremely}} useful if seedling traits are highly heritable and correlated to desired agronomic traits. Objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the response to selection for high shoot weight and divergent selection or seedling tiller number in big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) seedlings and obtain estimates of realized heritability for these traits. Base populations were breeding populations of ‘Pawnee’ big bluestem and ‘Pathfinder’ switchgrass. Divergent selection for single or multiple (three or more) tiller(s) 6 to 8 wk after planting in a greenhouse produced four populations [big bluestem high seedling weight, multiple tiller (BBMT); big bluestem high seedling weight, single tiller (BBST); switchgrass high seedling weight, multiple tiller (SWMT); and switchgrass high seedling weight, single tiller (SWST) ], which were planted in isolated <b>polycross</b> nurseries. Seed from <b>polycross</b> nurseries was used to conduct a second cycle of selection. Populations were evaluated in greenhouse studies for fresh weight and tiller number of seedlings. Seedling fresh weight was increased in BBST and SWST Cycle 2 populations, and divergent selection for tiller number resulted in populations significantly different from the base population. Realized heritability estimates for seed- ling tiller number in big bluestem and switchgrass were 0. 26 and 0. 23, respectively. The effect of genetic modification of seedling tiller number and shoot weight on establishment under field conditions and on mature plant phenotypes will need to be determined...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Thirty-three genotypes of {{red fescue}} were {{selected}} {{on the basis}} of diverse origin, anthesis date, and type of spreading from a space-planted introduction nursery. Open-pollinated, single-cross, and top-cross progeny nurseries were established into a randomized block with four replications, 20, 9, 8 entries, respectively, with nine plants per entry on two foot centers. Measured characteristics were plant height, plant width, and seed yield per plant. A <b>polycross</b> progeny row test nursery was established in a randomized block with eight replications in which 17 entries were assigned with rows 10 feet long. Measured characteristics for this progeny test were panicle length, number of branches per panicle, 100 -seed weight, 20 panicles seed yield, and seed yield per row. Single-cross and top-cross progenies were compared with their mean open-pollinated progeny performance, respectively. The association between characters for various progeny testing methods was measured by simple correlation coefficients. The creeping type parents resulted in progenies with greater width, height, and seed yield per plant than the non-creeping type when the open-pollinated progeny test was used. Associations between height, width, and seed yield in open-pollinated progeny were positive and significantly correlated with each other. The behavior in the open-pollinated progeny for seed yield was similar to the <b>polycross</b> progeny row test. For these three characters, clonal selection of parents may be effective. In the single-cross progeny, the single-cross between creeping and creeping was greater than any other combination for plant width and seed yield. Frequently there was no significant difference between combinations of crosses and among entries. In the top-cross progeny, the creeping type crossed with the non-creeping tester was the greatest in width and seed yield. For all three characters, the creeping type crossed with the non-creeping tester and the non-creeping type crossed with the creeping tester were greater than any other combination. The open-pollinated progeny of the creeping tester genotype was always greater than the open pollinated progeny of the non-creeping tester genotype. In the comparison of the top-cross with their mean open-pollinated progeny, the behavior of the top-cross progeny was quite different from their mean open-pollinated progeny for all characteristics. The top-cross method was desirable for the study of general and specific combining ability. The study would suggest that genotypes can be quickly identified by using the top-cross progeny test with a non-creeping tester. In the <b>polycross</b> progeny row test the creeping types which came from two isolations were greater than the non-creeping types for all five measured characteristics. Associations between the five characteristics were positive and significantly correlated except the correlation between 100 -seed weight and seed yield per row...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the efficiency of selection indices in alfalfa improvement, an experiment was conducted from 2000 to 2007 at East Azarbaijan Agricultural and Natural Resources Research Center, Iran. A set of 29 native ecotypes, which were collected in 2000 and 2001 from Azerbaijan (Iran), together with one improved variety were used to conduct a <b>polycross</b> nursery. For the purpose of random mating, a randomized complete block design was used with 12 replications arranged in this nursery. The resulting 30 half-sib families were planted individually in pots and the 30 days old seedlings were transplanted to the field in May, 2004. Each 3 -row plot consisted of 45 HS plants. Several traits, such as individual plants ’ fresh weight and individual plants ’ dry weight (IPFW, IPDW), number of shoots per plant (NS) and plant height (PH) in each harvest and also, days until 10 % flowering, the ratio of fresh and dry weight of leaves/plant and size of trifoliate leaves were measured for three cropping seasons. The results of analysis of variance showed large variation among <b>polycross</b> progenies. Six selection indices (Ii) with different number of traits at adult plant stage were evaluated. Based on {{the result of this}} investigation, if number of shoots and height of adult plant, excluding yield, are recorded, I 2 is suggested. If, in addition to fresh yield, height of adult plant is measured, I 6 is recommended. I 4 is useful when number of shoots and plant height with dry yield are included in the index. In conclusion, the importance of mature plant traits in selection indices was in the order of yield> plant height> number of shoots. The results provided more evidence that selection indices incorporating the component of dry yield are more advantageous. The most efficient selection index consisted of NS, IPDW and PH, having a relative efficiency of 280 %...|$|E
40|$|Brassica rapa cultivars occupy about 44 % of Canada's {{five million}} {{hectares}} of canola. However, B. rapa cultivars yield 15 to 20 % less seed {{than those of}} B. napus. In order to increase the competitiveness of B. rapa, significant increases in seed yield must be achieved. The development of hybrid cultivars of B. rapa could {{provide the basis for}} high yield. The objective of this research was to evaluate the performance of B. rapa doubled haploid (DH) lines and their potential use as parents in hybrid cultivars. A total of 162 DH lines, derived from five B. rapa breeding populations were evaluated in field tests at Saskatoon. Bud pollination was used to obtain selfed seed for evaluation of the DH lines. Sixteen top cross and 27 <b>polycross</b> progenies and 45 single cross hybrids were evaluated in the field to measure combining ability of DH lines. Many B. rapa DH lines were chlorophyll deficient as a result of expression of recessive alleles, a classical inbreeding phenomenon. Average seed and biological yield and number of seeds/pod of DH lines were only 24, 48, 46 % of their donor populations, indicating severe inbreeding depression. Inbreeding greatly extended days to flowering. However, seed weight, pod length and days to mature were less severely affected than other traits measured. Several DH lines equaled their donor population in plant weight and height at specific stages of growth, however, on average the overall growth and development of the DH lines was slower than their respective donor populations. One DH line (BC- 3015) equaled the seed and biomass yields of its donor population, suggesting that dominance deviation not overdominance was the genetic basis of high yield in B. rapa. It is suggested that chlorophyll deficient, late flowering DH plants could be discarded on the basis of greenhouse performance. Top cross and <b>polycross</b> procedures were equally effective in ranking DH lines for general combining ability (GCA). The top cross method of predicting GCA is the preferred method since it will allow the use of a weak, recessive tester which will not mask dominant alleles present in DH lines. Hybridity of top cross seed was high as measured by the erucic acid marker. The single cross procedure identified heterotic combinations which were different from those identified in the top cross and <b>polycross</b> methods. It was concluded that this difference was caused by the differential effects of male parents used to determine GCA. One single cross hybrid yielded significantly more seed than the check cultivar Tobin (130 %). It is concluded that DH lines of B. rapa will be useful in developing inbred parents for hybrid development and procedures for combining ability testing and maintenance of SI DH lines for the production of hybrids is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Eight genotypes of {{tall fescue}} were {{selected}} from a plant population consisting of 9000 individuals. Selection was based on early maturity, self-sterility, seed and forage potential, and nutritive value. Parental clones, single cross, open pollinated, self pollinated and <b>polycross</b> seeds were organized into a randomized block experiment with five replications each of which contained 63 entries with ten plants to the entry. The distance between entry rows was three feet; plants within the entry were planted one foot apart. The experimental nursery was planted on October 11, 1961, at the Hyslop Agronomy Farm, Corvallis, Oregon. Alta and Kentucky 31 varieties were used as checks. Parchment bags were used to secure information on self sterility and seed production. Height, maturity, disease incidence, number of culms per plant, panicles not harvested and forage yield were also evaluated. Griffing's model 1, experimental method 4, {{was used to test}} both general and specific combining ability. Simple correlation coefficients were calculated to measure the association between characters and between progeny testing methods within characters. The height of F₁ progenies was positively correlated with the height of both the mean of the parents and the largest parent. Height was also correlated with the number of culms per plant and the stage of maturity before harvesting. The stage of maturity of the single crosses was positively correlated with the stage of maturity of both the mean of the parents and the largest parent. Either <b>polycross</b> or open pollination may be used for evaluating maturity with comparable results. Although there was an incidence of Helminthisporium dyctioides, it was not serious enough to affect markedly the general performance of the plants in the nursery. The number of culms per plant for single crosses was negatively correlated with the number of culms for both the mean of the parents and the smallest parent. The number of culms per plant was also correlated with seed yield. From parents to S₁ there was a reduction in the number per plant...|$|E

The inheritance of this trait was also investigated through crosses performed and evaluated in the field and greenhouse.

40|$|Perennial grass-legume {{mixtures}} {{are important}} in forage production; however, little effort {{has been devoted to}} breeding either the grass or legume component for increased compatibility in mixtures. The objectives of this research were to study the genetic variation and response to selection for legume-compatibility traits in orchardgrass. Individual plants in 97 different germplasms were evaluated for vigor traits, canopy height, growth habit, anthesis date, tiller number and leaf length and width. <b>Polycross</b> progenies of the parents of Iowa 79 -OGP-DT were chosen for more detailed study because of their superiority in rust resistance, vigor, and winterhardiness and their variability for traits that may affect compatibility with a legume. Individual plant heritabilities were greater than 0. 40 for spring canopy height, growth habit, anthesis date, and leaf width. Significant phenotype correlations indicated that winterhardiness, vigorous growth, tall spring canopy height, erect growth habit, early anthesis, and narrow leaves tend to be associated with each other. High tiller number was associated with superior spring and fall vigor, and relatively high winterhardiness. Six cycle- 1 populations were developed by divergent selection in the <b>polycross</b> progenies for maturity, spring canopy height, and a compatibility index incorporating spring vigor, spring canopy height, growth habit, and tiller number. Significant direct and correlated responses were obtained from each selection strategy. Selection for early maturity, tall canopy height, and a high compatibility index value always decreased days to anthesis and increased spring canopy height, erectness of growth, tiller number, and dry matter yield in a space-planted test with the converse occurring from selection in the opposite direction. The three populations derived from selection for a high compatibility index value, tall spring canopy height, and early maturity consistently yielded more forage than their respective divergent populations in a space-planted test, in dense monoculture stands, and in mixtures with birdsfoot trefoil. The less aggressive populations permitted significantly more birdsfoot trefoil production in mixtures than the aggressive populations. This research indicates {{that it is possible to}} increase the compatibility of orchardgrass with birdsfoot trefoil by selection among spaced plants for decreased spring canopy height, decreased tiller number, and delayed maturity...|$|E
