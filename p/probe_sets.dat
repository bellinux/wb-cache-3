For the Sept96 evaluation, we designed a new evaluation protocol which required algorithms to match a set of 3323 images against a set of 3816 images. Thus, algorithms had to perform approximately 12.6 million matches. The new protocol design allowed the determination of performance scores for multiple galleries and <b>probe</b> <b>sets,</b> and perform a more detailed performance analysis. Results were reported for the following cases: (1) the gallery and probe images of a person were taken on the same day under the same lighting conditions, (2) the gallery and probe images of a person were taken on different days, (3) the gallery and probe images of a person were taken over a year apart, and (4) the gallery and probe images of a person were taken on the same day, but with different lighting conditions. There were two versions of the September 1996 evaluation. The first tested partially automatic algorithms by providing the images with the coordinates of the center of the eyes.

These <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> {{may or may}} not behave similar across treatments. The most appropriate way of consolidating sibling <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> suitable for analysis is an open problem. We propose the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) framework to decide which sibling <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> can be consolidated. Results The ANOVA model allows us to separate the sibling <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> into two types: those behave similarly across treatments and those behave differently across treatments. We found that consolidation of sibling <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> of the former type results in large {{increase in the number of}} differentially expressed genes under various statistical criteria.

40|$|International audienceMany recent microarrays hold an {{enormous}} number of <b>probe</b> <b>sets,</b> thus raising many practical and theoretical problems in controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Biologically, it is likely that most <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> are associated with un-expressed genes, so the measured values are simply noise due to non-specific binding; also many <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> are associated with non-differentially-expressed (non-DE) genes. In an analysis to find DE genes, these <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> contribute to the false discoveries, so it is desirable to filter out these <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> prior to analysis. In the methodology proposed here, we first fit a robust linear model for probe-level Affymetrix data that accounts for probe and array effects. We then develop a novel procedure called FLUSH (Filtering Likely Uninformative Sets of Hybridizations), which excludes <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> that have statistically small array-effects or large residual variance. This filtering procedure was evaluated on a publicly available data set from a controlled spiked-in experiment, as well as on a real experimental data set of a mouse model for retinal degeneration.

We investigated the behaviour and consistency of redundant <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> in a publicly-available data set containing samples from mouse brain amygdala and hippocampus and asked how applying filtering methods to the data affected consistency of results obtained from redundant <b>probe</b> <b>sets.</b> A genome-based filter that screens and groups <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> according to their overlapping genomic alignments significantly improved redundant probe set consistency.

40|$|While {{there is}} {{considerable}} research related to using differential gene expression to predict disease phenotype classification, e. g., neoplastic tissue from nonneoplastic controls, there is little understanding {{of the range of}} expression in normal tissues. Understanding patterns of gene expression in nonneoplastic tissue, including regional anatomic expression changes within an organ, is vital to understanding gene expression changes in diseased tissue. To explore the gene expression change along the proximal-distal axis of the large intestine, we analyzed microarray data in 184 normal human specimens using univariate and multivariate techniques. We found 219 <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> that were differentially expressed between the proximal and distal colorectal regions and 115 <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> that were differentially expressed between the terminal segments, i. e., the cecum and rectum. We did not observe any <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> that were statistically different between any two contiguous colorectal segments. The dominant expression pattern (65 <b>probe</b> <b>sets)</b> follows a dichotomous expression pattern consistent with the midgut-hindgut embryonic origins of the gut while a second pattern (50 <b>probe</b> <b>sets)</b> depicts a gradual change in transcript levels from the cecum to the rectum. While the dichotomous pattern includes roughly equal numbers of <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> that are elevated proximally and distally, nearly all <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> that show a gradual change demonstrate increasing expression levels moving from proximal to distal segments.

Research on soybean seed composition and yield has revealed that protein, oil and yield are controlled quantitatively and quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been identified for each of these traits. However, very limited information is available regarding the genetic mechanisms controlling seed composition and yield. To help address this deficiency, we used Affymetrix Soybean GeneChips® to identify genes that are differentially expressed between developing seeds of the Minsoy and Archer soybean cultivars, which differ in seed weight, yield, protein content and oil content. A total of 700 <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> were found to be expressed at significantly different (defined as having an adjusted p-value below or equal to 0. 05 and an at least 2 -fold difference) levels between the two cultivars at {{one or more of the}} three developmental stages and in at least one of the two years assayed. Comparison of data from soybeans collected in two different years revealed that 97 <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> were expressed at significantly different levels in both years. Functional annotations were assigned to 78 % of these 97 <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> based on the SoyBase Affymetrix™ GeneChip® Soybean Genome Array Annotation. Genes involved in receptor binding/activity and protein binding are overrepresented among the group of 97 <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> that were differentially expressed in both years assayed. <b>Probe</b> <b>sets</b> involved in growth/development, signal transduction, transcription, defense/stress response and protein and lipid metabolism were also identified among the 97 <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> and their possible implications in the regulation of agronomic traits are discussed.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of StatisticsHaiyan WangThe {{selection}} of relevant genes for classification of phenotypes for diseases with gene expression data have been extensively studied. Previously, most relevant gene selection {{was conducted on}} individual gene with limited sample size. Modern technology {{makes it possible to}} obtain microarray data with higher resolution of the chromosomes. Considering gene sets on an entire block of a chromosome rather than individual gene could help to reveal important connection of relevant genes with the disease phenotypes. In this report, we consider feature selection and classification while taking into account of the spatial location of <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> in classification of Duke’s stages B and C using DNA copy number data or gene expression data from colorectal cancers. A novel method was presented for feature selection in this report. A chromosome was first partitioned into blocks after the <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> were aligned along their chromosome locations. Then a test of interaction between Duke’s stage and <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> was conducted on each block of <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> to select significant blocks.

40|$|Abstract Background Affymetrix GeneChips ® {{are widely}} used for {{expression}} profiling {{of tens of thousands}} of genes. The large number of comparisons can lead to false positives. Various methods have been used to reduce false positives, but they have rarely been compared or quantitatively evaluated. Here we describe and evaluate a simple method that uses the detection (Present/Absent) call generated by the Affymetrix microarray suite version 5 software (MAS 5) to remove data that is not reliably detected before further analysis, and compare this with filtering by expression level. We explore the effects of various thresholds for removing data in experiments of different size (from 3 to 10 arrays per treatment), as well as their relative power to detect significant differences in expression. Results Our approach sets a threshold for the fraction of arrays called Present in at least one treatment group. This method removes a large percentage of <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> called Absent before carrying out the comparisons, while retaining most of the <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> called Present. It preferentially retains the more significant <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> (p ≤ 0. 001) and those <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> that are turned on or off, and improves the false discovery rate. Permutations to estimate false positives indicate that <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> removed by the filter contribute a disproportionate number of false positives. Filtering by fraction Present is effective when applied to data generated either by the MAS 5 algorithm or by other probe-level algorithms, for example RMA (robust multichip average). Experiment size greatly affects the ability to reproducibly detect significant differences, and also impacts the effect of filtering; smaller experiments (3 – 5 samples per treatment group) benefit from more restrictive filtering (≥ 50 % Present). Conclusion Use of a threshold fraction of Present detection calls (derived by MAS 5) provided a simple method that effectively eliminated from analysis <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> that are unlikely to be reliable while preserving the most significant <b>probe</b> <b>sets</b> and those turned on or off; it thereby increased the ratio of true positives to false positives. </p...|$|E
40|$|As {{distributed}} systems {{continue to grow}} in size and complexity, scalable and cost-effective techniques are needed for performing tasks such as problem determination and fault diagnosis. We address these tasks using probes, or end-to-end test transactions, which gather information about system components (e. g., using IBM's EPP technology). Effective probing requires minimizing the cost of probing while maximizing the diagnostic accuracy of the <b>probe</b> <b>set.</b> In this paper we introduce an information-theoretic approach to optimal <b>probe</b> <b>set</b> selection, and combine it with real-time probabilistic diagnosis using Bayesian networks. We show that selecting a pre-planned optimal <b>probe</b> <b>set</b> is NP-hard, but there exist polynomial-time approximation algorithms that perform well. Finally, the main contribution of the paper is a novel approach called active probing that allows adaptive, on-demand selection of most-informative probes, based on {{the current state of}} diagnosis. We demonstrate through both analysis and simulation that the active probing scheme can greatly reduce the number of probes (by almost 70 % in one of our practical applications) and the time needed for localizing the problem when compared with a non-active probing scheme...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} prediction of missing links, the known data are randomly divided into two parts, the training <b>set</b> and the <b>probe</b> <b>set.</b> We argue that this straightforward and standard method may lead to terrible bias, since in real biological and information networks, missing links {{are more likely to}} be links connecting low-degree nodes. We therefore study how to uncover missing links with low-degree nodes, namely links in the <b>probe</b> <b>set</b> are of lower degree products than a random sampling. Experimental analysis on ten local similarity indices and four disparate real networks reveals a surprising result that the Leicht-Holme-Newman index [E. A. Leicht, P. Holme, and M. E. J. Newman, Phys. Rev. E 73, 026120 (2006) ] performs the best, although it was known to be one of the worst indices if the <b>probe</b> <b>set</b> is a random sampling of all links. We further propose an parameter-dependent index, which considerably improves the prediction accuracy. Finally, we show the relevance of the proposed index on three real sampling methods.

50|$|The {{captured}} CTCs on {{the filter}} membrane of a ScreenCell isolation device, are {{transferred to a}} 24-well cell culture plate for enumeration/characterization using ViewRNA ISH Cell Assay. A target-specific <b>probe</b> <b>set</b> containing 20 oligonucleotide pairs hybridizes to the target RNA. An oligo pair hybridization event is essential for support of the signal amplification structure, which is assembled {{by a series of}} sequential hybridization steps. Each fully assembled amplification structure is contained within 40−50 bp of target RNA with the capacity for 400-fold signal amplification. Therefore, a typical target-specific <b>probe</b> <b>set</b> (containing 20 oligo pairs) can generate 8,000-fold signal amplification at the location of the target RNA.|$|R
