This estuary is on the tropical region and it {{is regarded as a}} polluted area. The samples were collected at 3 sites, and environmental parameters, nutrients and heavy metals were analyzed. The primary production was evaluated according to GR NTVED (1960) method whereas chlorophyll a and <b>phaeopigment</b> a were estimated by TETT et al. (1975) method. Total nitrogen K ranged from 20. 0 to 115. 0 mg·g- 1 while total phosphate ranged from 26. 0 to 223. 0 mg·g- 1. No significant seasonal variation of benthic primary production or chlorophyll a and <b>phaeopigment</b> a were observed. Significant positive correlation was found for microbenthic primary production and chlorophyll a. Primary production showed lower correlations whit nitrate, total nitrogen K, total phosphate and organic matter in the sediment. The values of <b>phaeopigment</b> a were higher than chlorophyll a. The means for chlorophyll a were 10. 4 mg·m- 2, 14. 9 mg·m- 2, 28. 6 mg·m- 2, 39. 7 mg·m- 2 and 26. 7 mg·m- 2. The mean values for primary production were 40. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{experiment}} {{was to determine if}} Acartia, a species of zooplankton, fed based on the size of food available. Acartia which more specifically are a type of copepod, have demonstrated this in other experiments. This experiment consisted of gathering seawater from Academy Bay in the Galapagos Islands, filtering it to remove zooplankton, then incubating it for four set time periods. Each time period included three bottles with added Acartia, while three others served as the control. Once the incubations were finished, each bottle of water was filtered with three different size filters; chlorophyll and <b>phaeopigment</b> retained on the filters was then measured. These measurements were done because they informed me how much chlorophyll based life existed for each size range at each time interval and additionally how much had been consumed. Chlorophyll is a green pigment found in the part of plants that conducts photosynthesis; while <b>phaeopigment</b> is chlorophyll degradated after it is consumed. The data attained from {{this experiment}} were not conclusive to Acartia preying on specific size fractions of phytoplankton; rather they likely preyed upon smaller zooplankton.

40|$|In {{these times}} of global change, {{understanding}} how carbon flows through ecosystems is of primary importance. In coastal Mediterranean regions, Posidonia oceanica meadows produce and store {{a lot of}} carbon, {{but most of it}} is described as refractory. As a step in the understanding of how organic matter degradation/storage happens in this ecosystem, this study focus on small scale relationships between the microbenthic loop (organic matter, microphytobenthos, bacteria and meiofauna) and environmental parameters (grain size, P. oceanica density, vegetal fibre biomass, pore water nutrient content, sediment total carbon (TC), organic carbon (TOC), nitrogen (TN) and phosphorous (TP) contents, <b>phaeopigments</b> and bacterial production (FDC)). Thus, a 1. 25 m x 1. 25 m frame was put in a pristine P. oceanica meadow and twelve points were randomly sampled in May 2008 for all the studied parameters. At such a small scale, every component of the microbenthic loop presented a heterogeneity, which was the highest for the microphytobenthos biomass and the lowest for total meiofauna abundance (TMA). No relationship was found between the components of the microbenthic loop but the abundances of Turbellaria and Ciliophora were correlated with total organic matter in the sediment (TOM). None of the environmental parameter was linked with the microphytobenthos biomass, suggesting that the high spatial variability observed did not depend on the measured parameters. Relationships were found between TOM and ammonium, total bacteria abundance and biomass (TBA and TBB) and sediment <b>phaeopigments,</b> TMA and TC, TN and TP. TBB variability was however explained by a combination of FDC and nutrient contents in pore water and sediment. Taking the microbenthic loop as a whole, pore water ammonium and nitrites + nitrates, FDC and <b>phaeopigments</b> were able to explain the observed variability. So, at small scale the variability in the microbenthic loop of a P. oceanica meadow is related with parameters linked with degradation processes and bacteria activities (<b>phaeopigments,</b> FDC, ammonium, nitrites + nitrates), except for meiofauna, which is related with the nutrient content of the sediment, especially TC.

40|$|The {{vertical}} distribution of phaeopigments {{in the ocean}} is traditionally interpreted {{as the result of}} the balance between two processes : 1) grazing by herbivores (= production) and (2) photo-oxidation by excess of light (= degration). If this interpretation is still correct for coastal and surface waters (e. g. spring bloom of phytoplankton and upwelled waters) there is today some evidence that the permanent (or seasonal) deep <b>phaeopigment</b> maximum layer in the bottom of the stratified euphotic zone (tropical and subtropical oceans) is largely overestimated.

In this paper, cluster analysis, principal component analysis and segment analysis were used to assess relations among factors influencing organic matter concentration in the Baltic sea-water. The following sea-water properties, salinity (Sal), temperature (Temp), pH, concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chla) and <b>phaeopigment</b> a (Feo), were assessed, while dissolved (DOC) and particulate (POC) organic carbon were used as organic matter measures. Water samples were collected {{in the course of a}} three-year study (2009 – 2011) from the Gdańsk Deep, the Gotland Deep and the Bornholm Deep (Southern Baltic). As a result, relations among both DOC and POC and the measured water properties were revealed. The cluster analysis leads to the discovery of the following structure of the analyzed water properties: DOC-pH, POC-Chla, without providing interpretation why the structure exists. Using the principal component analysis, factors influencing DOC and POC concentrations were classified as plankton activity and the inflows of saline and freshwater water masses as the study area. Segment regression analysis revealed that organic matter consists of labile and stable fractions and led to the quantification of relations between DOC and the measured sea-water properties. The following contributions to the DOC fluctuations were calculated: salinity – 11 %, chlorophyll a – 26 %, <b>phaeopigment</b> a – 26 %, POC – 38 % in the growing season and 31 %, 33 %, 21 % and 22 % respectively in the non-growing season...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the benthic {{communities}} of the Arctic Ocean's slope and abyssal plains. Here we report on benthic data collected from box cores along a transect from Alaska to the Barents Abyssal Plain during the Arctic Ocean Section of 1994. We determined: (1) density and biomass of the polychaetes, foraminifera and total infauna; (2) concentrations of potential sources of food (pigment concentration and percent organic carbon) in the sediments; (3) surficial particle mixing depths and rates using downcore 210 Pb profiles; and (4) surficial porewater irrigation using NaBr as an inert tracer. Metazoan density and biomass vary by almost three orders of magnitude from the shelf to the deep basins (e. g. 47 403 individuals m**- 2 on the Chukchi Shelf to 95 individuals m**- 2 in the Barents Abyssal Plain). Water depth is the primary determinant of infaunal density, explaining 39 % of the total variability. Potential food concentration varies by almost two orders of magnitude during the late summer season (e. g. the <b>phaeopigment</b> concentration integrated to 10 cm varies from 36. 16 mg m**- 2 on the Chukchi Shelf to 0. 94 mg m**- 2 in the Siberia Abyssal Plain) but is not significantly correlated with density or biomass of the metazoa. Most stations show evidence of particle mixing, with mixing limited to <= 3 cm below the sediment-water interface, and enhanced pore water irrigation occurs at seven of the nine stations examined. Particle mixing depths may be related to metazoan biomass, while enhanced pore water irrigation (beyond what is expected from diffusion alone) appears to be related to total <b>phaeopigment</b> concentration.

Concentrations were determined {{as a function}} of sediment depth at low tide. The analyses were carried out at monthly intervals over 1 yr. Pigment analysis indicated that the microphytobenthic community was dominated by diatoms throughout the sampling year. Chlorophyll b was not encountered at any time or depth, indicating that no input from macrophytic detritus had occurred at the sampling site. There was a large pool of <b>phaeopigments</b> a, of which phaeophorbides were the major forms (75 %). A microphytobenthic bloom occurred between March and June during which <b>phaeopigments</b> significantly increased with a high proportion of phaeophorbides likely due to intense grazing activity of benthic invertebrates. Pigment concentrations were still high at 5 cm depth and changes occurred simultaneously in the aphotic (5 mm sediment depth) layers of the sediment, reflecting an impact of bioturbation and physical mixing (resuspension/redeposition) of the upper sediment layer. There was a decrease of the pigment content of the sediment between June and July. It was attributed to grazing and to a resuspension event. Overall, the pigment analysis of this intertidal sediment indicates a predominance of the diatom community, a close coupling between the dynamics of microphytobenthos biomass and the grazing activity of benthic invertebrates, and the influence of sediment mixing...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{importance}} of phytoplankton as a food source for benthic consumers, Kinsale harbour, a small estuary in the southwest of Ireland, was sampled {{on a monthly basis}} during the course of 1994. Nutrients, salinity, temperature, pigments (chlorophyll a and <b>phaeopigments)</b> and phytoplankton species composition were determined along longitudinal and vertical profiles. Based on salinity distributions, Kinsale harbour can be classified as a partially mixed estuary. River discharge and tidal mixing result in a strong estuarine circulation and an intensive exchange between the estuary and coastal waters. As a result, residence time is too low (< 1 day) for autochthonous phytoplankton populations to develop and phytoplankton observed in Kinsale harbour is predominantly advected from coastal waters. High concentrations of <b>phaeopigments,</b> exceeding those of chlorophyll a, were observed at the uppermost stations sampled, suggesting mass mortality and accumulation of coastal phytoplankton within the estuary. Possible causes for this phenomenon include osmotic stress or grazing by macrozooplankton within the estuary and the subsequent entrapment of senescent phytoplankton or faecal pellets in the baroclinic circulation near the salt wedge. It is suggested that in small estuaries, like Kinsale harbour, which are strongly influenced by river discharge, estuarine circulation induces the import of coastal phytoplankton into the estuary and provides an allochthonous carbon source to consumers within the estuary. status: publishe...|$|R

For bacterial abundance, enzymatic activity, and organic matter determinations, samples were collected at 5 -m depth from a sediment surface delimited by a 42 × 42 -cm frame, divided into 49 squares. In order to test {{the influence of the}} bottom microtopography on the investigated variables, the size of this frame was defined to cover the distance between two subsequent ripples. As indicated by Fisher's index, benthic bacteria, enzymatic activities, proteins, carbohydrates, and their soluble fractions exhibited an aggregate distribution. Sampling size (i. e., sample unit of 36 cm 2) was appropriate for all variables, except for chlorophyll a and frequency of dividing cells that displayed a contagious distribution. To estimate the reliability of the current sampling strategy, we compared the mean values from three randomly selected sample units with the average value of the entire sediment surface (i. e., 49 samples). For all variables reported in this study, the use of three replicates was representative of the mean values of the sampled area with a confidence limit within ± 20 %.

Leaf area of E. ferox showed positive correlation with PAR, day length, rainfall, humidity, air temperature, water temperature, pH, TDS, conductivity, NO 3 -N, SRP and planktonic <b>phaeopigment</b> concentrations. Among these parameters positive correlation between leaf area and day length was found to be significant at 5 % level. However, both leaf area and petiole length of E. ferox showed negative correlation with alkalinity, DO, soluble reactive silicate (SRS) and chlorophyll a...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A reverse-phase h. p. l. c. {{technique}} {{was used to}} estimate the concentration of chlorophyll b in phyto-plankton cultures, fecal pellets of Calanuipacificus, and suspended paniculate matter from the Central North Pacific, Oregon coastal waters, and Dabob Bay (a temperate fjord in Puget Sound, WA, USA). The purpose {{was to assess the}} distribution of this pigment in the euphotic zone and its effect on the fluorometnc estima-tion of phaeopigments. Analyses of natural waters confirm high chlorophyll b concentrations (median mass ratio of Mb:a> 0. 3) at the depth of the chlorophyll a maximum in tropical waters while values for temperate plankton are relatively low (median mass ratio of chl b:a = 0. 05) and patchy. Zooplankton fecal pellets show-ed a significant enrichment in chlorophyll b, suggesting grazing as a mechanism to explain high concentrations of this pigment {{at the bottom of the}} euphotic zone. It is estimated that the presence of chlorophyll b could cause an average overestimation of <b>phaeopigment</b> concentration by the fluorometric technique of 38 % between 0 and 200 m in the Central North Pacific. This effect is more pronounced at the layer of chlorophyll b max-imum (120 - 140 m) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{variations}} of the biochemical composition of Tetraselmis suecica and Isochrysis galbana during growth and decay were determined. The content of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) of the cultures, as expected, slowly degraded into <b>phaeopigments</b> during decay, confirming that chlorophyll measurements do not always provide an accurate estimate of phytoplanktonic biomass and, consequently, may fail if {{used to measure the}} food availability of particulate matter for consumers. Measurements of total amounts of proteins, carbohydrates and lipids, related to the nutritional value of particles in terms of caloric content, are shown to provide information on the readily available food for consumers, particularly during the blooms. The protein/carbohydrate, C/N and POC/Chl-a ratios were used to evaluate the differences between these two species during the growth and the decomposition processes. A comparison between experimental and field conditions was undertaken to implement our understanding of the growth and degradation processes of particulate organic matter of phytoplanktonic origin in the sea and its role on natural systems, during and after phytoplankton blooms...|$|R
40|$|Some {{chemical}} and biological parameters were analysed at sixteen stations in the mangrove ecosys-tem, of the neighbouring Gautami–Godavari (GG) river estuary and Kakinada (KKD) bay to understand the present status of water quality {{and the impact of}} external terrigenous inputs dur-ing southwest (SW) monsoon in the study areas. High concentrations of nutrients in the mangrove ecosystem compared to the bay and estuarine ecosystems reveal the importance of this zone as a source of nutrients to the adjacent coastal ecosystems. Low Si: N: P (29 : 4 : 1) ratios in these ecosystems are due to the enrichment of these nutrients through external anthropogenic inputs even after the utilization by phytoplankton in the biological cycle. The mean Chl b/Chl a and Chl c/Chl a ratios and high <b>phaeopigments</b> (Pp) concentrations compared to Chl b and high ratios of Chl a/Pp suggests the possibility of the potential growth of phytoplankton populations in lower light intensity and low turbulent areas of these mangrove ecosystems. 1...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} changes in meiofauna community structure were investigated {{to assess the}} impact of a fish farm, which was operating continuously for 15 years (La Spezia Gulf, W Mediterranean). Sediment samples were collected in June, July, September, October 2000 and February 2001 for the analysis of phytopigments (chlorophyll-a and <b>phaeopigments),</b> the biochemical composition of organic matter (proteins, carbohydrates and lipids) and related to meiofaunal parameters. Sediment organic matter reached extremely high concentrations beneath the fish cages when compared to the control. Particularly lipids, carbohydrates and chlorophyll-a were significantly higher in fish-farm sediments. On a long-term basis meiofauna displayed adaptations in sediments beneath the cages resulting in an increase of density. Organic impact on meiofaunal community structure was evident in terms of an increase of the nematodes to copepods (Ne=Co) and nauplius to copepods (Na=Co) ratios in fish farm sediments. Cumaceans and kinorhynchs were encountered in control sediments, but disappeared in fish-farm samples. These data suggest that meiofauna is a sensitive tool for evaluating the effects of organic enrichment in fish farm impacted areas...|$|R
