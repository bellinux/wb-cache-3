METHODS: TT (human medullary carcinoma cells) -bearing nu/nu mice of the Institute of Cancer Research genotype received intraperitoneal injections of different chain lengths and weights of glutamic acids, aspartic acids, and derivatives of glutamic acids. Uptake in tumors and organs was determined and compared with the values for untreated control mice. RESULTS: Accretion of (111) In-DTPA-dGlu(1) -minigastrin in the kidneys could be reduced by up to 90 %. The uptake values for all other organs and the tumors were not affected.

40|$|Clinicopathological {{correlations}} {{from human}} cases and experimental animal {{studies suggest that}} neutrophils are critical components of the host response to mucormycosis but that other cellular defense mechanisms appear to be important as well. Since our previous studies demonstrated that Rhizopus oryzae hyphae which are too large to be ingested completely can be damaged and probably killed by human neutrophils, we studied the antihyphal activity of human monocytes. As with neutrophils, light and electron microscopic studies indicated that monocytes attached to hyphae and appeared to destroy them {{in the absence of}} serum. As judged by our previously described assay for the leukocyte-induced inhibition of [14 C]uracil uptake by hyphae, quantitative damage to hyphae by monocytes was 40. 8 +/- 2. 2 % in 54 experiments. Neither attachment to nor damage of hyphae by monocytes was augmented by the presence of 10 % human serum. As with neutrophils, monocyte-mediated damage of R. oryzae was significantly decreased by some inhibitors of oxidative metabolism and scavengers of the potentially microbicidal oxidative leukocyte products, which included 10 (- 4) M sodium azide, 10 (- 3) M sodium cyanide, catalase, 10 (- 3) M histidine, 10 (- 3) M tryptophan, and 10 (- 4) M 1, 4 -diazobicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane but not superoxide dismutase, 1. 4 X 10 (- 2) M dimethyl sulfoxide, and 4. 0 X 10 (- 1) M mannitol.

In contrast to our previous data for neutrophils, polyanions (10 (- 5) M <b>polyaspartic</b> or polyglutamic <b>acid)</b> did not inhibit monocyte-mediated hyphal damage.

50|$|Another {{point of}} {{uncertainty}} {{is why the}} scale of the outbreak is so great. Maracaibo is fed by both salt water from the Caribbean and fresh water from numerous rivers. The lighter fresh water floats on top of the heavier salt water, which forms a dense layer on the bottom. This set-up traps nutrients that have settled {{on the floor of the}} lake. In the spring of 2004, heavy rains disrupted the usual pattern. The sudden influx of fresh water stirred the layers, allowing nutrients to float to the top, where duckweed and other plants reside. These nutrients may have triggered the duckweed's rapid expansion. Additional sources of nutrients include untreated sewage discharge and fertilizers and other industrial waste flowing into the lake through rivers (97 percent of the country's raw sewage is discharged without treatment into the environment). Furthermore, chemicals used to clean up oil spills may have contributed to the duckweed problem.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of gentamicin with daptomycin and PI dispersions was investigated by FTIR spectroscopy. We {{found no evidence}} of a direct interaction involving the neutralization of the aspartate residues of daptomycin by gentamicin and the amide I band of daptomycin did not reveal significant conformational changes of its peptidic moiety. On the other hand, daptomycin readily inserts within bilayers of PI, dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol or dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, as judged from its influence on the fluidity of these bilayers. The incorporation of daptomycin into PI bilayers has only a slight effect on the lipopeptide amide I band. The affinity of the aminoglycoside for PI is slightly increased in the presence of daptomycin, in agreement with the results of the dialysis study mentioned above. Gentamicin induces a slight narrowing of the amide I band of daptomycin bound to PI bilayers. The fluidity of the lipid bilayers corresponds to that seen in the absence of both drugs. It is proposed that {{in the presence of the}} lipopeptide antibiotic, the critical charge density and membrane fluidity required for optimal enzyme activity is restored, explaining its nephroprotective capabilities.

Coadministration of <b>polyaspartic</b> <b>acid</b> (drug-polypeptide mass ratio 1 : 2. 5) did not modify the drug serum levels, as recorded during or shortly after the infusion. Yet, it was associated with 1) an increased (approximately 35 %) drug cortical content at day 0; 2) a significant protection against both biochemical (decrease of sphingomyelinase activity at day 0; increase of lipid phosphorus content at day 2) and morphological (enlargement of lysosomes and deposition of myeloid bodies at day 2) signs of lysosomal phospholipidosis in proximal tubular cells; and 3) an almost complete protection against increased cell turnover (mostly in proximal tubules) in cortex at day 2, as assessed by the measurement of [3 H]thymidine incorporation into DNA and the enumeration of S-phase cells after histoautoradiography.

Contrary to the literature data based on chem. degrdn., NMR studies showed conclusively that in thermal <b>poly(aspartic</b> <b>acid)</b> only b-peptide linkages were present. This result cast serious doubt on the role thermal condensation might have played in prebiotic polypeptide syntheses...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{investigation}} of the conformational properties of some charged homopolypeptides in dilute aqueous solutions by computer simulation. A method of molecular dynamics for the full-atomic models of <b>polyaspartic</b> <b>acid</b> and polylysine with explicit account of water and counter-ions is used for this purpose. For systems containing these polypeptides we calculated time trajectories and the size, shape, distribution functions and time correlation functions of inertia radius and the distances between the ends of peptide chains. We have also calculated the solvatation characteristics of considered polyelectrolytes. We have found out that <b>polyaspartic</b> <b>acid</b> in dilute aqueous solution has more compact structure and more spherical shape than polylysine. We have shown that these differences are due to different interaction between the polypeptides and water molecules (in particular, {{the quality and quantity}} of hydrogen bonds formed by these peptides with water), and the difference in an amount of ion pairs formed by the charged groups of the peptides and counter-ions. The obtained results should be taken into account for elaboration of new products based on the investigated peptides and their usage in various industrial and biomedical applications...|$|E
40|$|New {{amphiphilic}} dendritic peptides on dendritic <b>polyaspartic</b> <b>acid</b> {{were designed}} and synthesized. The organogel and liquid crystal properties of these amphiphilic dendritic peptides were fully studied by field-emission SEM, temperature dependent FT-IR, differential scanning calorimetry, polarization optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction experiments. Amphiphilic dendritic peptides G 3 show good organogel properties {{with a minimum}} gelation concentration as low as 1 wt %. Furthermore, amphiphilic dendritic peptides G 3 can form a hexagonal columnar liquid crystal assembly over a wide temperature range...|$|E
40|$|Modified <b>poly(aspartic</b> <b>acid)</b> /poly(vinyl alcohol) interpenetrating {{polymer network}} (KPAsp/PVA IPN) {{hydrogel}} for drug controlled release was synthesized {{by a simple}} one-step method in aqueous system using <b>poly(aspartic</b> <b>acid)</b> grafting 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane (KH- 550) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) as materials. The hydrogel surface morphology and composition were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The thermal stability was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The swelling properties and pH, temperature, and salt sensitivities of KPAsp, KPAsp/PVA semi-interpenetrating polymer network (semi-IPN), and KPAsp/PVA IPN hydrogels were also investigated. All of the three hydrogels showed ampholytic pH-responsive properties, and swelling behavior was also extremely sensitive to the temperature, ionic strength, and cationic species. Finally, the drug controlled release properties of the three hydrogels were evaluated and results indicated that three hydrogels could control drug release by external surroundings stimuli. The drug controlled release properties of KPAsp/PVA IPN hydrogel are the most outstanding, and the correlative measured release profiles of salicylic acid at 37 °C were 32. 6 [*]wt% at pH = 1. 2 (simulated gastric fluid) and 62. 5 [*]wt% at pH = 7. 4 (simulated intestinal fluid), respectively. These results indicated that KPAsp/PVA IPN hydrogels are a promising carrier system for controlled drug delivery...|$|E
