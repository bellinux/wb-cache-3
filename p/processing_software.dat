5|$|A same-document {{reference}} is a URI {{reference to a}} document containing the URI reference itself. A URI {{reference is}} defined as a same-document reference if, when resolved to absolute form, it equates exactly to the base URI in effect for the reference. When encountering a same-document reference, document <b>processing</b> <b>software,</b> for example a web browser, to efficiently use its current representation of a document to satisfy the resolution of a reference to that document without fetching a new representation. URI equivalence is defined as when a URI reference, while not identical to the base URI, still represents the same resource.|$|E

25|$|For {{very precise}} {{positioning}} (e.g., in geodesy), these {{effects can be}} eliminated by differential GPS: the simultaneous use {{of two or more}} receivers at several survey points. In the 1990s when receivers were quite expensive, some methods of quasi-differential GPS were developed, using only one receiver but reoccupation of measuring points. At the TU Vienna the method was named qGPS and post <b>processing</b> <b>software</b> was developed.|$|E
25|$|Acute accents {{may be used}} to emphasise a word in a phrase, on the vowel in the {{stressed}} syllable. If the vowel {{is written}} as a digraph, an acute accent is put on both parts of the digraph. Although that rule includes ij, the acute accent on the j is frequently omitted (resulting in íj instead of íj́), as putting an acute accent on a j is problematic in most word <b>processing</b> <b>software.</b> If the vowel is written as more than two letters, the accent is put on the first two vowel letters.|$|E

Some {{of the more}} exotic of these resulting systems have gone beyond the functionality of the original hardware and have included variations such as a portable system with a color LCD (e.g. PocketFami). Others have been produced with certain specialized markets in mind, such as an NES clone that functions as a rather primitive personal computer, which includes a keyboard and basic word <b>processing</b> <b>software.</b> These unauthorized clones have been helped by {{the invention of the}} so-called NES-on-a-chip.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Most systems {{connected}} to the Internet are general purpose machines (except specialized routers and switches in the network core) that handle packet <b>processing</b> in <b>software.</b> Even in the network core, there is a trend towards packet <b>processing</b> in <b>software,</b> e. g. using OpenFlow or virtual switches. While packet <b>processing</b> in <b>software</b> is flexible and offers many capabilities, it also represents a challenge to evaluate, optimize, or predict the performance of such complex systems. This {{makes it hard to}} evaluate the networking performance of servers, end user hosts, or home routers. We present a study that investigates the packet latency caused by packet processing in the Linux network stack. We develop a simulation model in ns- 3 for packet processing via the Linux network stack that helps understanding of its performance implications. We validate our simulation model based on measurements with nanosecond accuracy and softwar...|$|R

25|$|Microsoft Word is {{the most}} widely used word <b>processing</b> <b>software</b> {{according}} to a user tracking system built into the software. Microsoft estimates that roughly half a billion people use the Microsoft Office suite, which includes Word. Many other word processing applications exist, including WordPerfect (which dominated the market from the mid-1980s to early-1990s on computers running Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system, and still (2014) is favored for legal applications), Apple's Pages application, and open source applications such as OpenOffice.org Writer, LibreOffice Writer, AbiWord, KWord, and LyX. Web-based word processors such as Office Online or Google Docs are a relatively new category.|$|E
25|$|Rough set {{methods can}} be applied as a {{component}} of hybrid solutions in machine learning and data mining. They {{have been found to be}} particularly useful for rule induction and feature selection (semantics-preserving dimensionality reduction). Rough set-based data analysis methods have been successfully applied in bioinformatics, economics and finance, medicine, multimedia, web and text mining, signal and image <b>processing,</b> <b>software</b> engineering, robotics, and engineering (e.g. power systems and control engineering). Recently the three regions of rough sets are interpreted as regions of acceptance, rejection and deferment. This leads to three-way decision making approach with the model which can potentially lead to interesting future applications.|$|E
25|$|Newspapers {{are usually}} printed on cheap, off-white paper known as newsprint. Since the 1980s, the {{newspaper}} industry has largely {{moved away from}} lower-quality letterpress printing to higher-quality, four-color process, offset printing. In addition, desktop computers, word <b>processing</b> <b>software,</b> graphics software, digital cameras and digital prepress and typesetting technologies have revolutionized the newspaper production process. These technologies have enabled newspapers to publish color photographs and graphics, as well as innovative layouts and better design. To help their titles stand out on newsstands, some newspapers are printed on coloured newsprint. For example, the Financial Times is printed on a distinctive salmon pink paper, and Sheffield's weekly sports publication derives its name, the Green 'Un, from the traditional colour of its paper. The Italian sports newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport is also printed on pink paper while L'Équipe (formerly L'Auto) is printed on yellow paper. Both the latter promoted major cycling races and their newsprint colours were reflected in the colours of the jerseys used to denote the race leader; for example the leader in the Giro d'Italia wears a pink jersey.|$|E

500|$|On February 11, 2005, Deep Impacts rockets {{were fired}} as planned {{to correct the}} spacecraft's course.

The [...] "commissioning phase" [...] verified that all instruments were activated and checked out. During these tests {{it was found that}} the HRI images were not in focus after it underwent a bake-out period. After mission members investigated the problem, on June 9, 2005, it was announced that by using image <b>processing</b> <b>software</b> and the mathematical technique of deconvolution, the HRI images could be corrected to restore much of the resolution anticipated.|$|E

2500|$|Other early word-processing {{software}} required users to memorize semi-mnemonic key combinations rather than pressing keys labelled [...] "copy" [...] or [...] "bold". (In fact, many early PCs lacked cursor keys; WordStar famously used the E-S-D-X-centered [...] "diamond" [...] for cursor navigation, and modern vi-like editors encourage use of hjkl for navigation.) However, the price differences between dedicated word processors and general-purpose PCs, {{and the value}} added to the latter by software such as VisiCalc, were so compelling that personal computers and word <b>processing</b> <b>software</b> soon became serious competition for the dedicated machines. Word processing became the most popular use for personal computers, and unlike the spreadsheet (dominated by Lotus 1-2-3) and database (dBase) markets, WordPerfect, XyWrite, Microsoft Word, , {{and dozens of other}} word <b>processing</b> <b>software</b> brands competed in the 1980s; PC Magazine reviewed 57 different programs in one January 1986 issue. Development of higher-resolution monitors allowed them to provide limited WYSIWYG—What You See Is What You Get, to the extent that typographical features like bold and italics, indentation, justification and margins were approximated on screen.|$|E
