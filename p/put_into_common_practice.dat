CLIPS-R {{may be used for}} a variety of knowledge-base revision tasks, such as refining a prototype system, adapting an existing system to slightly different operating conditions, or improving an operational system that makes occasional errors.

INTRODUCTION Considerable {{progress has been made in}} the last few years in the subfield of machine learning known as theory revision, e. g. [1, 2, 3].

By the time the fourth edition of this book was published in 1995, there were more than 3500 published works on this topic.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a formal model of object-oriented concepts; in particular {{we focus on}} the concepts found useful by experienced designers of reusable software components. The value of the formal model is shown by studying safe substitution of sets of objects in a software system. Safe substitution means that sets of objects may be substituted with similar sets, {{while the rest of the}} objects in the system will observe no difference. The conclusion is that safe substitution can be ensured by setting sufficient requirements on the sets of objects and on the similarity relations between such sets. Many of these requirements correspond with <b>common</b> design <b>practice.</b> However, the study has shown that some requirements traditionally considered necessary are not needed, and that new requirements must be added to ensure safe substitution. If or when these new requirements are incorporated <b>into</b> <b>common</b> <b>practice,</b> the result will, hopefully, be more efficient system development and maintenance...|$|R

Our purpose is to offer a method for synthesizing the findings from multi or mixed method evaluations to reach defensible evaluation (primarily summative) conclusions. The proposed method uses a set of criteria and analytic techniques to assess the worth of each data source or type, and what each says about program effect. Once on a common scale, simple math allows synthesis across data sources or types. The method should prove a valuable tool for evaluators across a range of experience...|$|R
40|$|Dropout {{is used as}} a {{practical}} tool to obtain uncertainty estimates in large vision models and reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. But to obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, a grid-search over the dropout probabilities is necessary - a prohibitive operation with large models, and an impossible one with RL. We propose a new dropout variant which gives improved performance and better calibrated uncertainties. Relying on recent developments in Bayesian deep learning, we use a continuous relaxation of dropout's discrete masks. Together with a principled optimisation objective, this allows for automatic tuning of the dropout probability in large models, and as a result faster experimentation cycles. In RL this allows the agent to adapt its uncertainty dynamically as more data is observed. We analyse the proposed variant extensively on a range of tasks, and give insights <b>into</b> <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> in the field where larger dropout probabilities are often used in deeper model layers...|$|R
