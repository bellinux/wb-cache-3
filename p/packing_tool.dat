40|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, this is the first {{algorithm}} unifying arbitrary rectilinear block packing and soft block packing. Furthermore, this algorithm handles arbitrary convex or concave rectilinear block packing in the most efficient way compared to other sequence pair-based approaches. At the same time, the algorithm can handle rectangle soft block effectively. The concept of non-redundant constraint graph together with its algorithms play critical role in unifying the arbitrary rectilinear block packing and soft block packing. This general block <b>packing</b> <b>tool</b> builds the foundation for floorplanning with IP reuse. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of this general block packing...|$|E
40|$|The {{complexity}} of Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGAs) logic blocks have undergone constant evolution {{to the point}} where both the basic soft logic blocks that implement combinational logic and the fixed-function hard blocks contain complex interconnects, hierarchy and modes. The goal of this thesis is to both support that complexity and enable future architecture exploration of even increased complexity and new kinds of hard functionality. To accomplish this, a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) flow that can map a user circuit to an FPGA with these complex blocks is needed. We propose a new language that can describe these complex blocks and a new area-driven tool for the packing stage of that CAD flow. The packing stage groups components of a user circuit into the complex blocks available on the FPGA. We conduct experiments to illustrate the quality of the <b>packing</b> <b>tool</b> and to demonstrate the newly-enabled architecture exploration capabilities...|$|E
40|$|Project Purpose The aim of {{this project}} was to {{integrate}} the searching of e-books and other e- resources into the COSE Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) {{in order to provide}} reusable and searchable reference objects within the VLE which draw seamlessly on the referenced resources, and which could be integrated, packaged and exported with other content. Overview of Project Status The project has successfully enabled the searching of two leading e- aggregators from within the COSE VLE via its standard ‘Search Tools’ interface. Referenced objects are viewable via the standard COSE Browser. It has successfully integrated RELOAD to enable the re-use of reference objects through the metadata description based on UK LOM CORE. Our implementation of this schema is recorded in an application profile developed by the project. Some work, principally that relating to the export of the new re- useable reference objects using COSE’s existing content <b>packing</b> <b>tool,</b> is still outstanding but will be progressed as part of Staffordshire University’s wider ICE project...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of future FPGA fabrics with {{more sophisticated and}} complex logic blocks requires a new CAD flow that permits the expression of that complexity {{and the ability to}} synthesize to it. In this paper, we present a new logic block description language that can depict complex intrablock interconnect, hierarchy and modes of operation. These features are necessary to support modern and future FPGA complex soft logic blocks, memory and hard blocks. The key part of the CAD flow associated with this complexity is the packer, which takes the logical atomic pieces of the complex blocks and groups them into whole physical entities. We present an area-driven generic <b>packing</b> <b>tool</b> that can pack the logical atoms into any heterogeneous FPGA described in the new language, including many different kinds of soft and hard logic blocks. We gauge its area quality by comparing the results achieved with a lower bound on the number of blocks required, and then illustrate its explorative capability in two ways: on fracturable LUT soft logic architectures, and on hard block memory architectures. The new infrastructure attaches to a flow that begins with a Verilog front-end, permitting the use of benchmarks that are significantly larger than the usual ones, and can target heterogenous FPGAs...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondrial {{cytochrome}} c (cyt-c) plays a {{key role}} in the activation of intrinsic apoptosis. Cyt-c gains a new function under apoptotic conditions; the peroxidation of mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin (CL) by cyt-c is a required step in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Understanding the mechanism of this alternate functionality in cyt-c has implications for treatment of neurological diseases like Huntington’s disease and in cancer. In order to gain insights into this mechanism, structural and dynamical information on the membrane bound protein is required. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) provides an array of tools to study this system and extract necessary structural and dynamical information on the protein as well as the membranes. In this thesis, magic-angle-spinning (MAS) NMR and static ssNMR are used in conjunction with various other biophysical tools to gain insights into the mechanism of cyt-c’s peroxidase activity. The effect of lipid peroxidation by cyt-c during apoptosis has also been implicated in modulating the structure, dynamics and behaviour of mitochondrial membranes, including facilitating pore formation in cyt-c-bound liposomes [1 - 3]. An understanding of lipid structure and phase behaviour has tremendous bearing on the study of lipids, membrane proteins and cryoprotection in general and cyt-c’s role in apoptosis in particular. MAS NMR is used here to investigate the link between the freezing point depression of water and the lowering of the lipid transition temperature. One of the requirements to performing MAS NMR is a method of sample preparation that provides highly concentrated samples in tiny microliter sized MAS sample rotors. Additionally, for biological samples, as the ones under study here, it is very important to maintain hydration of the sample at all times in order to preserve function of the protein and the membranes, prevent damage to the sample, obtain better quality NMR spectra and most importantly, maintain biological relevance. Thus, the design and use of an ultracentrifuge based <b>packing</b> <b>tool,</b> that fulfills the requirements listed above, is discussed and illustrated here...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{investigate}} the opportunity brought by controllable-polarity transistors to design efficient reconfigurable circuits. Controllable-polarity transistors are devices whose polarity can be electrostatically programmed {{to be either}} n- or p-type. Such devices are used to build ultrafine grain computation cells. These cells are arranged into regular matrices, called MClusters, with a fixed and incomplete interconnection pattern, employed to minimize the reconfigurable interconnection overhead. We subsequently use them into field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). To assess this architectural scheme in an efficient and objective manner, we present a complete bench-marking tool flow {{and focus on the}} packing algorithm developed to handle the architecture. We finally perform the evaluation with widely used benchmark circuits. Leveraging the ultrafine grain cells compactness from a system-level perspective, we show that FPGAs exploiting MClusters demonstrate average savings of 43 % and 23 % in area and delay, respectively, as compared with the CMOS lookup table FPGA counterpart at 22 -nm technological node.

40|$|We {{met them}} in a {{sheltered}} place, these visitors from far away. They were unsure {{what to do with}} our outstretched arms and had no replies to our greetings. Wordlessly, they unravelled from their <b>packs</b> <b>tools</b> of wood and metal, musical instruments as it turned out, and began to assemble them - tiny tubes with switches, a disc with a circular brush, a sea shell with a row of mouthpieces, and a patchwork quilt of shakers, I believe. Once fully rigged, the contraptions were hoisted onto their shoulders and they began to play. As they made their sounds, they rocked back and forth and their eyes begged us for appreciation. At the time, we took this gentle cacophony to be their music though later deduced that it was the gift of a parody of our own. Yet how insensitive to pitch they surely are for these simple melodies to seem like ours? Why cloud the texture with such relentless rattling? And what a confusing current must their experience of time be to replace the God-given steadiness of breath and pulse with mere ebb and flow, as if rhythm were for sounding longing rather than the swing of a limb...|$|R
