50|$|Human metapneumovirus {{was first}} {{classified}} as a <b>pneumovirus</b> in 2001. Human metapnuemovirus (HMPV) is a negative single-stranded RNA virus that {{is the second most}} common cause of lower respiratory infection in young children. <b>Pneumovirus</b> is intermediate in size between other Paramyxoviridae and the Orthomyxoviridae. Cytoplasmic inclusions are considerably more dense than those of other viruses in the family. Human metapneumovirus is very similar to your common cold; it is an upper respiratory infection. It will typically occur in the winter and early spring. This specific infection is most common in children, especially under the age of five. Common symptoms include runny nose, congestion, sore throat, cough, headache, and fever, which can be seem in a cold. It will typically go away after a few days. If this is seen in people over 75 then there is a cause for concern as it can turn to pneumonia.|$|E
50|$|The best {{methods of}} {{prevention}} of orthopneumovirus infection are covering cough and sneezing to prevent transmission of possible pathogens.

Molecular studies have been on the rise due to continuing materials and information obtained regarding recombinant DNA arrangements that might offer a foundation for vaccine development. Currently animals are able to receive vaccines specific to their virus strand. During cold and peak flu season, infants and small children have the option to receive monthly injections of small medication doses at a weak strength to help prevent virus/ host attachment.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pneumovirus</b> infections cause a wide {{spectrum}} of respiratory disease in humans and animals. The airway epithelium is the major site of <b>pneumovirus</b> replication. Apoptosis or regulated cell death, may contribute to the host anti-viral response by limiting viral replication.

40|$|Lower {{respiratory}} tract infection {{by the human}} <b>pneumovirus</b> respiratory syncytial virus is a frequent cause of acute lung injury in children. Severe <b>pneumovirus</b> disease in humans is associated with activation of the granzyme pathway by effector lymphocytes, which may promote pathology by exaggerating proapoptotic caspase activity and proinflammatory activity. The main goal {{of this study was}} to determine whether granzymes contribute to the development of acute lung injury in pneumovirus-infected mice. Granzyme-expressing mice and granzyme A- and B-cluster single- and double-knockout mice were inoculated with the rodent <b>pneumovirus</b> pneumonia virus of mice strain J 3666, and were studied for markers of lung inflammation and injury. Expression of granzyme A and B is detected in effector lymphocytes in mouse lungs in response to <b>pneumovirus</b> infection. Mice deficient for granzyme A and the granzyme B cluster have unchanged virus titers in the lungs but show a significantly delayed clinical response to fatal <b>pneumovirus</b> infection, a feature that is associated with delayed neutrophil recruitment, diminished activation of caspase- 3, and reduced lung permeability.

The tetramer is asymmetric, three of the protomers exhibiting a closed conformation, and one an open conformation. Molecular dynamics simulations and SAXS demonstrate a dynamic equilibrium between open and closed conformations in solution. Structures of adenosine monophosphate- and DNA- bound M 2 - 1 establish {{the role of the}} zinc finger domain in base-specific recognition of RNA. Binding to 'gene end' RNA sequences stabilized the closed conformation of M 2 - 1 leading to a drastic shift in the conformational landscape of M 2 - 1.

Every orthopneumovirus is characterized as host specific, and has a range of diseases involved with respiratory illness. Orthopneumoviruses can cause diseases that range from a less-severe upper-respiratory illness to severe bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Orthopneumoviruses are found among sheep, cows, and most importantly humans. In humans, the orthopneumovirus that specifically impacts infants and small children is known as human respiratory syncytial virus. <b>Pneumoviruses</b> have been traced by researchers from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the University Medica Centre in Utrecht, Netherlands on how orthopneumoviruses attack infants and small children.|$|R

40|$|The use of {{glucocorticoids}} for {{the treatment}} of symptoms associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection has been questioned. To evaluate the sequelae of glucocorticoid administration in the setting of <b>pneumovirus</b> infection in vivo, hydrocortisone was administered to mice infected with pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), a <b>pneumovirus</b> and natural rodent pathogen that is closely related to RSV and replicates the signs and symptoms of severe human RSV infection. Results showed that hydrocortisone spared the pulmonary neutrophilia but resulted in ablation of the pulmonary eosinophilia, despite continued production of the relevant chemoattractant, macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 alpha. Hydrocortisone also led to diminished production of inducible nitric oxide synthase and accumulation of reactive nitrogen species in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and diminished lymphocyte recruitment. PVM-infected mice responded to hydrocortisone with enhanced viral replication and accelerated mortality. These results suggest several mechanisms to explain why glucocorticoid therapy may be of limited benefit in the overall picture of <b>pneumovirus</b> infection...|$|E
50|$|<b>Pneumoviruses</b> {{replicate}} in the cytoplasm of {{the host}} cell. First, the virus binds to HN glycoprotein receptors expressed {{on the surface of}} the cell. Then, through the action of the fusion protein, the virus fuses to the host plasma membrane and the nucleocapsid is released. Prior to undergoing replication, mRNA is transcribed and viral proteins are translated. Transcription is dependent on virally encoded RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase, with binds the genome at the 3' leader region and then sequencially transcribes each gene. Translation of viral proteins is carried out by host cell ribosomes. Once sufficient P, N, L, and M2 proteins are available to create a capsid around the newly replicated genome, the virus undergoes replication. After replication, the P, L, and M proteins participate in forming the ribonucleocapsid. Once virion assembly is complete, the virion egresses by budding out of the cell.|$|R
40|$|Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), {{a leading}} cause of {{respiratory}} tract infections in infants, inhibits type I interferon (IFN) signaling by an unidentified mechanism. In this study, we showed that infection of airway epithelial cells with hMPV decreased cellular level of Janus tyrosine kinase (Jak 1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk 2), due to enhanced proteosomal degradation and reduced gene transcription. In addition, hMPV infection also reduced the surface expression of type I IFN receptor (IFNAR). These inhibitory mechanisms are different from the ones employed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which does not affect Jak 1, Tyk 2 or IFNAR expression, but degrades downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins 2 (STAT 2), although both viruses are <b>pneumoviruses</b> belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family. Our study identifies a novel mechanism by which hMPV inhibits STAT 1 and 2 activation, ultimately leading to viral evasion of host IFN responses...|$|R
40|$|The {{matrix protein}} (M) of {{paramyxoviruses}} {{plays a key}} role in determining virion morphology by directing viral assembly and budding. Here, we report the crystal structure of the human metapneumovirus M at 2. 8 Å resolution in its native dimeric state. The structure reveals the presence of a high-affinity Ca binding site. Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) predict a secondary lower-affinity site that correlates well with data from fluorescence-based thermal shift assays. By combining small-angle X-ray scattering with MDS and ensemble analysis, we captured the structure and dynamics of M in solution. Our analysis reveals a large positively charged patch on the protein surface that is involved in membrane interaction. Structural analysis of DOPC-induced polymerization of M into helical filaments using electron microscopy leads to a model of M self-assembly.

40|$|The {{first study}} {{describes}} attempts to increase and measure sensitivity of molecular tests to detect avian <b>pneumovirus</b> (APV). PCR diagnostic tests {{were designed for}} the detection of nucleic acid from an A-type avian <b>pneumovirus</b> genome. The objective was selection of PCR oligonucleotide combinations, which would provide the greatest test sensitivity, and thereby enable optimal detection when used for later testing of field materials. Relative and absolute test sensitivities could be determined because of laboratory access to known quantities of purified full-length DNA copies of APV genome derived from the same A-type virus. Four new nested PCR tests were designed in the fusion (F) protein [2 tests], small hydrophobic (SH) protein [1 test] and nucleocapsid (N) protein [1 test] genes and compared to an established test in the attachment (G) protein gene. Known amounts of full-length avian <b>pneumovirus</b> genome were serially diluted 10 -fold and these dilutions were used as templates for the different tests. Sensitivities were found to differ between the tests, with the most sensitive being the established G test, which proved able to detect 6000 copies of the G gene. The G test contained predominantly pyrimidine residues at its 3 ’ termini and because of this, oligonucleotides for the most sensitive F test were modified to incorporate the same residue types at their 3 ’ termini. This was found to increase sensitivity so that after full 3 ’ pyrimidine substitutions the F test became able to detect 600 copies of the F gene. In the second study a new nested PCR in the SH gene was designed and tested.

40|$|Eosinophils are {{recruited}} to the lung {{in response to}} infection with <b>pneumovirus</b> pathogens and {{have been associated with}} both the pathophysiologic sequelae of infection and, more recently, with accelerated virus clearance. Here, we demonstrate that the <b>pneumovirus</b> pathogens, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), can infect human and mouse eosinophils, respectively, and that virus infection of eosinophils elicits the release of disease-related proinflammatory mediators from eosinophils. RSV replication in human eosinophils results in the release of infectious virions and in the release of the proinflammatory mediator, interleukin- 6 (IL- 6). PVM replication in cultured bone marrow eosinophils (bmEos) likewise results in release of infectious virions and the proinflammatory mediators IL- 6, IP- 10, CCL 2, and CCL 3. In contrast to the findings reported in lung tissue of RSV-challenged mice, PVM replication is accelerated in MyD 88 gene-deleted bmEos, whereas release of cytokines is diminished. Interestingly, exogenous IL- 6 suppresses virus replication in MyD 88 gene-deleted bmEos, suggesting a role for a MyD 88 -dependent cytokine-mediated feedback circuit in modulating this response. Taken together, our findings suggest that eosinophils are targets of virus infection and may have varied and complex contributions to the pathogenesis and resolution of <b>pneumovirus</b> disease...|$|E

The APV L gene is 6099 nucleotides long and encodes a single large ORF of 2004 amino acids. This makes the APV L protein the smallest to be described for any nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA virus. The protein contains six linear non-contiguous domains, a putative ATP-binding site and four polymerase motifs previously described for the L proteins of negative-strand RNA viruses.

50|$|A {{licensed}} {{vaccine for}} humans is still many years distant. The Department of Virology of Erasmus MC, Rotterdam in the Netherlands {{is working on}} developing a Metapneumovirus vaccine for humans. Enhancement of the binding of palivizumab to the HRSV F protein resulted in a second-generation monoclonal antibody, motavizumab (Numax, MedImmune Inc.), which is currently under study in phase III clinical trials. For members of the Paramyxovirinae subfamily, very young infants are the main target group for immunization. Since these children have not yet developed a mature immune system, a multidose vaccine strategy may be needed, starting in the first weeks of life. The vaccination efficacy in these children may also be hampered {{by the presence of}} maternally derived antibodies, which may provide partial protection to wild-type virus infections but also suppress the primary immune response on immunization. <b>Pneumoviruses</b> replicate entirely in the cytoplasm, and this process begins with adsorption of the virus to the cellular receptor on the host cell, directed by the viral attachment protein, variously called G, H (hemagglutinin) or HN (hemagglutinin-neuraminidase).|$|R
40|$|Abstract The mature F protein of {{all known}} {{isolates}} of human {{respiratory syncytial virus}} (HRSV) contains fifteen absolutely conserved cysteine (C) residues that are highly conserved among the F proteins of other <b>pneumoviruses</b> {{as well as the}} paramyxoviruses. To explore the contribution of the cysteines in the extracellular domain to the fusion activity of HRSV F protein, each cysteine was changed to serine. Mutation of cysteines 37, 313, 322, 333, 343, 358, 367, 393, 416, and 439 abolished or greatly reduced cell surface expression suggesting these residues are critical for proper protein folding and transport to the cell surface. As expected, the fusion activity of these mutations was greatly reduced or abolished. Mutation of cysteine residues 212, 382, and 422 had little to no effect upon cell surface expression or fusion activity at 32 °C, 37 °C, or 39. 5 °C.

It was created in 2016 by {{elevating}} the now dissolved paramyxoviral subfamily Pneumovirinae. Natural hosts include humans, cattle, and rodents. There are currently 5 species in the Pneumoviridae family, divided between 2 genera (Metapneumovirus and Orthopneumovirus). <b>Pneumoviruses</b> produce spherical, enveloped virions (virus particles) that vary in size from 150 to 200 nm in diameter. The nucleocapsid consisting of a protein shell and viral nucleic acids has a helical symmetry. Nucleocapsids have a diameter of 13.5 nm and a helical pitch of 6.5 nm. The genome is composed of negative-sense single-stranded RNA that is non-segmented. It is about 15kb in size, and encodes 11 proteins. A unique feature of the genome is the M2 gene, which encodes proteins M2-1 and M2-2. The Pneumoviridae M2-1 protein is distinctive, and no homologue {{has been found in}} any other virus families. It functions as a processivity factor for the virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and promotes viral RNA synthesis.

A series of GS mutants were created, where each of the nine bases of the gene start consensus sequence of a reporter gene was changed to every other possible base, and the resulting effect on initiation of transcription was assayed. Nucleotide positions 1, 2 and 7 were found to be most sensitive to mutation whilst positions 4, 5 and 9 were relatively insensitive.

The virus with a deleted SH gene also showed the greatest impairment of replication both in cell culture and in infected turkeys. This contrasts with the situation with other <b>pneumoviruses</b> in culture and in model animals, where deletion of the SH gene results in little effect upon viral yield and a good antibody response. Replication of the G- and M 2 - 2 -deleted viruses was impaired more severely in turkeys than in cell culture, with only some animals showing evidence of virus growth and antibody production.

Furthermore, PVM infection in IFNγ−/− mice promoted prominent inflammation, including eosinophil and neutrophil infiltration into the airways and lung parenchyma, observed several days after peak virus titer. Potential mechanisms include over-production of chemoattractant and eosinophil-active cytokines (CXCL 1, CCL 11, CCL 3 and IL 5) in PVM-infected IFNγ−/− mice; likewise, IFNγ actively antagonized IL 5 -dependent eosinophil survival ex vivo.

PVM infection in mice has been shown to faithfully mimic the severe RSV disease in human infants. This study aimed at dissecting the remarkable PVM-resistance shown by the SJL/J strain. To characterize its genetic component, we assessed clinical, physiopathological, and virological resistance/susceptibility traits in large first (F 1) and second (F 2) generations obtained by crossing the SJL/J (resistant) and 129 /Sv (susceptible) strains. Then, to acquire conclusive in vivo evidence in support of the hypothesis that certain radiosensitive hematopoietic cells might {{play a significant role in}} PVM-resistance, we monitored the same resistance/ susceptibility traits in mock- and c-irradiated SJL/J mice. Segregation analysis showed that (i) PVM-resistance is polygenic, (ii) the resistance alleles are recessive, and (iii) all resistance-encoding alleles are concentrated in SJL/J. Furthermore, there was no alteration of SJL/J PVM-resistance after immunosuppression by c-irradiation, which suggests that adaptive immunity is not involved.

Unlike members of the Paramyxovirinae subfamily, the polymerase complex of pneumovi-ruses requires an additional cofactor, the M 2 - 1 protein, which functions as a transcriptional antitermination factor. TheM 2 - 1 protein was found to incorporate zinc ions, although the specific role(s) of the zinc binding activity in viral replication and pathogenesis remains unknown. In this study, we found that the third cysteine (C 21) and the last histidine (H 25) in the zinc binding motif (CCCH) of hMPVM 2 - 1 were essential for zinc binding activity, whereas the first two cysteines (C 7 and C 15) play only minor or redundant roles in zinc binding. In addition, the zinc binding motif is essential for the oligomerization of M 2 - 1. Subsequently, recombinant hMPVs (rhMPVs) carrying mutations in the zinc binding motif were recovered. Interestingly, rhMPV-C 21 S and-H 25 Lmutants, which lacked zinc binding activity, had delayed replication in cell culture and were highly at-tenuated in cotton rats. In contrast, rhMPV-C 7 S and-C 15 S strains, which retained 60 % of the zinc binding activity, replicated as efficiently as rhMPV in cotton rats. Importantly, rhMPVs that lacked zinc binding activity triggered high levels of neutralizing antibody and provided complete protection against challenge with rhMPV. Taken together, these results demonstrate that zinc binding activity is indispensable for viral replication and pathogenesis in vivo. These results also suggest that inhibition of zinc binding activity may serve as a novel approach to rationally attenuate hMPV and perhaps other <b>pneumoviruses</b> for vaccine pur...|$|R
