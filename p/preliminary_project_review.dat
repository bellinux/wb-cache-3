40|$|During late April, we {{modified}} {{the budget and}} work plan for FY 95 to reflect a $ 2000 K funding reduction for this fiscal year. These changes incorporate both the delayed start and slow ramp-up due to DOE funding uncertainties, {{as well as new}} and real reductions in Project activities. Due to the significant budgeting impact, this report reflects the resulting budget changes (for April). Scope and schedule impact, however, will be documented in the May report due to the additional effort involved in assessing schedule impact. We will combine the May Monthly Report and the Revised FY 95 Plan for cost efficiency; we will submit the FY 95 Plan Rebaseline for approval by DOE in May. Technical progress continued during April, but was redirected toward the new FY 95 Plan. Key changes in the revised plan are to delete MEO from Project scope and wrap up work to date, defer further major procurements for the Project from FY 95, delete MSO staff additions (with milestones), and defer work and milestones in other WBS elements. Engineering development, preliminary design, and peer reviews continued in preparation for the <b>Project</b> <b>Preliminary</b> Design <b>Review.</b> The budget reduction is executed to delay the <b>Project</b> <b>Preliminary</b> Design <b>Review</b> until Ql of FY 96...|$|R
40|$|A {{continuing}} {{concern over}} the last few months was resolved with the approval of the Environmental Assessment (EA) and signing of the Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI). This was completed in time to allow approval of the DWTF Phase 1 KD- 3 and subsequent award of the construction contract for this phase (site preparation). The Project continues to make progress toward the <b>Project</b> <b>Preliminary</b> Design <b>Review</b> (PDR), scheduled for November 15 - 16, 1995. We completed the conventional feed preparation and solid feed preparation demonstration technologies (telerobotic sorting) and conducted a prereview of the Analytical Services element. Molten Salt is scheduled for October 3 - 4, with Water Treatment and Analytical Services completing the reviews by October 12. While a number of design issues have been raised and are being tracked, the general level of engineering progress is consistent with completing the PDR on schedule. No show-stoppers have been identified, and all items requiring resolution before PDR will be competed...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} two factors that impact managers' {{willingness}} to share private information during the <b>project</b> <b>review</b> stage of capital budgeting. Drawing on the cognitive dissonance {{theory and the}} agency theory, we find that both high perceived personal responsibility {{and the use of}} <b>project</b> <b>reviews</b> for performance evaluation result in a greater tendency for managers to withhold negative private information. However, we do not find an interaction between these two factors. Our study makes a contribution to both the academic literature investigating factors affecting <b>project</b> <b>reviews</b> and the practitioner literature looking at design and implementation of effective <b>project</b> <b>reviews.</b> Copyright (c) The Authors.

40|$|M. Tech. Many organisations rely on Information Technology (IT) {{projects}} {{to react to}} competitive pressure and innovation. IT projects are divers and they may include installing off-the-shelf hardware to developing software to basic technologies that provide information to support the operations, management, decisions-making functions within the organisation. In the past years, {{there had been an}} increasing number of Multinational Organisations (MNOs) working on IT {{projects to}}gether to create mergers and grow business in foreign countries. While IT projects are being undertaken, Multinational Project Teams are faced with challenges and among their challenges <b>project</b> <b>reviews</b> is one of them. <b>Project</b> <b>reviews</b> are an essential process of learning new things and capturing what had been learned in the current phase/project in order for future phases/projects to benefit. Moreover it is a stage where project teams assess if they had met their key deliverables and project performance. A related study was conducted on <b>project</b> <b>reviews</b> and the results revealed that 4 out of 5 organisations did not conduct post-project reviews. However, if they did conduct <b>project</b> <b>reviews,</b> there were no guidelines on how to do it. The aim {{of the study was to}} ascertain a set of guidelines that are used by MNOs to conduct <b>project</b> <b>reviews</b> and share lessons learned and experiences gathered during and after an IT projects for future usage. The significance of this study was to highlight the importance of guidelines for conducting <b>project</b> <b>reviews</b> in order for project teams to learn from the project. The findings can be utilised in building guidelines that MNOs can use to conduct <b>project</b> <b>reviews</b> and to integrate lessons learned back into the organisation. The scope of the research was limited to an MNO with headquarters in the Netherlands and subsidiaries in China and South Africa. The study was carried out using qualitative research approach through interviews, observation and gathering of documentation. Using Atlas. ti which is a ii CAQDAS, data was analysed to compare and contrast similarities by using categories. The categories constructed offered the integrative interpretation of what was learned. From the individual and focus group interviews 5 main categories were elicited: <b>project</b> <b>review</b> meetings, intervals of conducting <b>project</b> <b>reviews,</b> lessons learned, knowledge sharing, and information extracted from <b>project</b> <b>reviews.</b> Based on the results it was evident that the MNO in question requires a set of guidelines on how to conduct <b>project</b> <b>reviews.</b> Moreover, there was no formal mechanism used to integrate lessons learned back into the organisation. A Generic Model for when <b>project</b> <b>reviews</b> should be conducted was developed using various models and guidelines that are used by other organisations and this model could be utilised by MNOs. For each project phase as illustrated on the Generic Model, there are <b>project</b> <b>review</b> guidelines on what to measure during the phase review. This research contributes to the growing literature on the organisational processes and mechanisms for <b>project</b> <b>reviews</b> and lessons learned...|$|R
