5|$|A {{photovoltaic}} power station, {{also known}} as a solar park, is a large-scale <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>system</b> (PV system) designed for the supply of merchant power into the electricity grid. They are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised solar power applications because they supply power at the utility level, rather than to a local user or users. They are sometimes also referred to as solar farms or solar ranches, especially when sited in agricultural areas. The generic expression utility-scale solar is sometimes used to describe this type of project.|$|E

25|$|Electrical {{efficiency}} (also called conversion efficiency) is {{a contributing}} factor {{in the selection of}} a <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>system.</b> However, the most efficient solar panels are typically the most expensive, and may not be commercially available.

25|$|A <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>system</b> {{converts}} {{light into}} electrical direct current (DC) by {{taking advantage of}} the photoelectric effect. Solar PV has turned into a multi-billion, fast-growing industry, continues to improve its cost-effectiveness, and has the most potential of any renewable technologies together with CSP. Concentrated solar power (CSP) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. CSP-Stirling has by far the highest efficiency among all solar energy technologies.|$|E
25|$|A <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>system,</b> or solar PV {{system is}} a power system {{designed}} to supply usable solar power by means of photovoltaics. It consists of an arrangement of several components, including solar panels to absorb and directly convert sunlight into electricity, a solar inverter to change the electric current from DC to AC, as well as mounting, cabling and other electrical accessories. PV systems range from small, roof-top mounted or building-integrated systems with capacities from a few to several tens of kilowatts, to large utility-scale power stations of hundreds of megawatts.

25|$|Albedo {{can affect}} the {{electrical}} energy output of solar photovoltaic devices. For example, {{the effects of a}} spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions. Research showed impacts of over 10%. More recently, the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>system</b> topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.|$|E
25|$|The Greek tourist boom {{beginning}} in the mid-20th century largely bypassed Kythnos because its harbor lacked a deep-water dock for ferryboats. The {{construction of a new}} mole in 1974 precipitated great changes. Today, the island is a modern, prosperous place, with a burgeoning tourist trade. It is in the forefront of alternative energy experiments, with the establishment in 1982 of Greece’s first wind park. With the addition of a <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>system</b> and storage batteries, the amount of diesel fuel required to supply the island’s electricity has been reduced by 11%. Numerous individual houses on remote coves are equipped with photovoltaic systems, and nearly all houses employ solar water heaters.|$|E
25|$|The {{efficiency}} of the solar cells used in a <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>system,</b> in combination with latitude and climate, determines the annual energy output of the system. For example, a solar panel with 20% efficiency and an area of 1m2 will produce 200W at Standard Test Conditions, but it can produce more {{when the sun is}} high in the sky and will produce less in cloudy conditions and when the sun is low in the sky. In central Colorado, which receives annual insolation of 5.5kWh/m2/day, such a panel can be expected to produce 440kWh of energy per year. However, in Michigan, which receives only 3.8kWh/m2/day, annual energy yield will drop to 280kWh for the same panel. At more northerly European latitudes, yields are significantly lower: 175kWh annual energy yield in southern England.|$|E
