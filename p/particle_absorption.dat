50|$|Quantum Monte Carlo {{is a way}} to {{directly}} study the many-body problem and the many-body wave function beyond these approximations. The most advanced quantum Monte Carlo approaches provide an exact solution to the many-body problem for non-frustrated interacting boson systems, while providing an approximate, yet typically very accurate, description of interacting fermion systems. Most methods aim at computing the ground state wavefunction of the system, with the exception of path integral Monte Carlo and finite-temperature auxiliary field Monte Carlo, which calculate the density matrix. In addition to static properties, the time-dependent Schrödinger equation can also be solved, albeit only approximately, restricting the functional form of the time-evolved wave function, as done in the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo. From the probabilistic point of view, the computation of the top eigenvalues and the corresponding ground states eigenfunctions associated with the Schrödinger equation relies on the numerical solving of Feynman-Kac path integration problems.

40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of optical and microphysical properties of aerosol particles during the dry winter monsoon season above the northern Indian Ocean is presented. The Cloud Aerosol Radiative Forcing Experiment (CARDEX), conducted from 16 February to 30 March 2012 at the Maldives Climate Observatory on Hanimaadhoo island (MCOH) in the Republic of the Maldives, used autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (AUAV) to perform vertical in situ measurements of particle number concentration, particle number size distribution as well as <b>particle</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficients. These measurements were used together with surface- based Mini Micro Pulse Lidar (MiniMPL) observations and aerosol in situ and off-line measurements to investigate the vertical distribution of aerosol particles. Air masses were mainly advected over the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Peninsula. The mean surface aerosol number concentration was 1717 [*]±[*] 604 cm − 3 and the highest values were found in air masses from the Bay of Bengal and Indo-Gangetic Plain (2247 [*]±[*] 370 cm − 3). Investigations of the free tropospheric air showed that elevated aerosol layers with up to 3 times higher aerosol number concentrations than at the surface occurred mainly during periods with air masses originating from the Bay of Bengal and the Indo-Gangetic Plain. This feature is different compared to what was observed during the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) conducted in winter 1999, where aerosol number concentrations generally decreased with height. In contrast, lower <b>particle</b> <b>absorption</b> at the surface (σ abs (520 nm) [*]=[*] 8. 5 [*]±[*] 4. 2 Wm − 1) was found during CARDEX compared to INDOEX 1999. Layers with source region specific single-scattering albedo (SSA) values were derived by combining vertical in situ <b>particle</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficients and scattering coefficients calculated with Mie theory. These SSA layers were utilized to calculate vertical <b>particle</b> <b>absorption</b> profiles from MiniMPL profiles. SSA surface values for 550  nm for dry conditions {{were found to be}} 0. 94 [*]±[*] 0. 02 and 0. 91 [*]±[*] 0. 02 for air masses from the Arabian Sea (and Middle East countries) and India (and Bay of Bengal), respectively. Lidar-derived <b>particle</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficient profiles showed both a similar magnitude and structure as the in situ profiles measured with the AUAV. However, primarily due to insufficient accuracy in the SSA estimates, the lidar-derived absorption coefficient profiles have large uncertainties and are generally weakly correlated to vertically in situ measured <b>particle</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficients. Furthermore, the mass absorption efficiency (MAE) for the northern Indian Ocean during the dry monsoon season was calculated to determine equivalent black carbon (EBC) concentrations from <b>particle</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficient measurements.
