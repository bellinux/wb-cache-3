The analysis of this non-judicial remedy offered the chance {{to reflect on the}} more general issue of the differences between administrative procedure and judicial review. Starting from the contributions of traditional scholars about administrative appeal and contentious procedure, the essay identifies formal features that structurally characterize a "process" and, according to the prospective chosen, these elements have been combined with a functional analysis. After this survey, the new binding <b>pre-litigation</b> <b>advice</b> of ANAC is identified with the category of“administrative decision”and this conclusion brings specific results in terms of rules applicables.

40|$|SUMMARY A case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease {{treated with}} {{amantadine}} showed considerable initial improvement, {{followed by a}} period of almost five years during which the patient remained in a relatively stable condition until he died accidentally. The diagnosis was confirmed histologically. Case report This man (DC), aged 56 years, was admitted to hospital on 13 June 1972. There was a history that, in recent weeks, he had become excessively anxious and developed paranoid delusions about his wife and about his work. He believed everyone was watching him. He had feelings of unworthi-ness, and he had stopped eating and going to work. Physical examination was normal and investiga-tions, including full blood count, erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate (ESR), Wasserman reaction (WR), Reiter protein, and chest radiograph were all normal. Psychological assessment was attempted but was unsuccessful. A course of ECT was started, and at first he seemed to respond. How-ever, the improvement was not maintained, and by September 1972 he was confused, disorientated, and unable to speak clearly. By October he was mute and passive, communicating by gesture.

40|$|The American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) {{significantly}} {{lowered the}} tax cost at which US firms could access their unrepatriated foreign earnings. We use this temporary {{shock to the}} cost of internal financing, and its variation across firms, to examine the role of capital constraints in the firm’s investment decisions. Controlling for the ability to repatriate foreign earnings in a more tax efficient way under the AJCA, we find that for a majority of firms there was little change in domestic investment – the policy objective of the law. We do find, however, that for the subset of firms which are capital constrained, they invested a majority of the repatriated funds in approved domestic investment. We find little change in financial policy (e. g. leverage and equity payouts) once we control for the ability to repatriate funds under the AJCA. These findings point out the importance of understanding finance theory when designing optimally targeted tax incentives.

We {{also thank}} Alberto Palloni who {{provided}} comments and <b>advice</b> <b>o</b> n Primary health care programs, including childhood immunizations, are intensively utilized {{by the majority}} of Latin American households. During 1985 - 1991, governments used national PHC infrastructures to implement the Regional Polio Eradication Initiative. Unprecedented vaccine coverage levels were attained through a combination of mass campaigns, house-to-house vaccinations and improvements in routine immunization services. Little is known, however, about the effects of these interventions on immunization demand; whether they reached so-called highrisk households and, if so, whether program effects were sufficient to offset the negative risk factors. Using the household production of health model, this paper examines the probability and timing of full immunization over this period in one case country, Colombia. Information on the immunization status of 3609 vaccine-eligible children born 1985 - 90 was extracted from Colombia's 1990 Demographic and Health Survey. Annual immunization coverage estimates from the Colombian Ministry of Health for 1985 - 90 for 148 sample municipios were appended to each child record, along with household-level data.

The single-dose acute oral toxicities of crude aqueous extracts of Strychnos spinosa and Bobgunnia madagascariensis fruits and the foliage of Vernonia amygdalina and Cissus quadrangularis (plant species that are commonly used as pesticides in Southern Africa) were evaluated in BALB/c mice. Plant extracts (up to 75 % w/v or v/v) were orally administered to sexually mature mice. Behavioural changes, clinical signs and mortality were monitored for 4 days. Mice that received S. spinosa had generalized tonic muscle spasms and a high mortality of 83 %. Those that received B. madagascariensis exhibited signs of buccal and nasal irritation with occasional sneezes during administration and a high mortality of 75 % was recorded. C. quadrangularis consumption resulted in much lower mortality of 21 % while no clinical signs of toxicity were evident on mice administered V. amygdalina. Chemical analysis showed the presence of secoiridoids in the seedless pulp of S. spinosa.

The last 15 to 20 years has witnessed increasing scientific research, consumer activity, and political response towards animal welfare issues within Europe.

5000|$|Man, {{although}} an infinitesimal part of God's creation, yet stands apart from it {{insofar as it}} is the only species blessed with reflection, moral sense and potentiality for understanding matters metaphysical. Human birth is both a special privilege for the soul and a rare chance for the realization of union with God. Man is lord of earth, as Guru Arjan says, [...] "Of all the eight million and four hundred thousand species, God conferred superiority on man" [...] (SGGS, 1075), and [...] "All other species are your (man's) water-bearers; you have hegemony over this earth" [...] (SGGS, 374).

Guru Nanak had warned, [...] "Listen, listen to my <b>advice,</b> <b>O</b> my mind! only good deed shall endure, and there may not be another chance" [...] (SGGS, 154). So, realization of God and a reunion of atma (soul) with paramatma (Supreme Soul, God) are the ultimate goals of human life. The achievement ultimately rests on nadar (God's grace), but man has to strive in order to deserve His grace. As a first step, he should have faith in and craving for the Lord. He should believe that God is near him, rather within his self, and not far away. He is to seek Him in his self.|$|R
40|$|Patent law {{turns the}} attorney-client {{privilege}} on its head. Patent law punishes willful infringers by subjecting them to treble damages. An odd set of legal rules stemming from patent law's effort {{to determine what}} constitutes willful infringement effectively requires companies confronted with a patent first to obtain a written opinion of counsel and then to disclose that opinion in court. To do that, the accused infringer will have to waive its attorney-client privilege in virtually every case. Even worse, the law puts the question whether an accused infringer will have to waive privilege {{in the hands of}} the patent owner, who can send a carefully crafted letter putting a potential defendant on notice of the patent. A patent owner thus triggers the obligation to obtain a written opinion of counsel without actually threatening to sue anyone. In turn, accused infringers who are aware of these rules respond to such letters by obtaining a sort of pseudo-legal advice that both they and their attorneys recognize to be a construct. Both plaintiffs and defendants are playing a costly game. The rules of this game have perverse consequences for patent law. Some of these consequences affect litigation - lawyers and clients who know that the lawyer's advice will be disclosed to the other side will behave differently, withholding information and candid advice from each other. But other consequences extend beyond litigation. They infect <b>pre-litigation</b> <b>advice,</b> essentially making it impossible for a competent lawyer to advise a client that a competitor's patent should be avoided. The rules of the willful infringement game set traps for the unwary, who may not realize the consequences of failing to obtain the necessary written opinion of counsel. They interfere with a client's ability to choose counsel. And they discourage engineers and companies from reading a competitor's patents at all, thereby undermining the disclosure function that is at the foundation of the patent system. One possibility is to abolish the willfulness rule entirely. We ultimately reject this approach because we worry that ordinary patent damages alone will be insufficient to deter infringement optimally in many cases. Another possibility is to abolish the rule that requiring disclosure of opinions of counsel. While a good idea, this option would not solve the problems created by the willfulness game, because many defendants will still need to rely on the opinion of counsel in order to disprove willfulness. Instead, we think the better approach to willful infringement is first to redefine it as adopting a technology with knowledge that it was derived from the patentee, and second to adjust the premium charged for it. Many of the problems with the willfulness rules stem from the fact that willfulness is an ongoing inquiry. The ongoing nature of the inquiry adversely affects a defendant that develops or adopts a technology in good faith but later learns it is infringing a patent. Changing the focus of the inquiry to the time of adoption is consistent with the ordinary understanding of willfulness outside of patent law and would help end the willfulness game. An independent developer could never be a willful infringer, and thus would not need either to obtain or disclose in court a written opinion of counsel merely because it later learned of a patent. By contrast, an accused infringer would need advice of counsel if it was aware of a patent and affirmatively sought to design around the patent. Such an accused infringer therefore would have to waive privilege. But since only the accused infringer's intent at the time of adoption would matter, the scope of privilege waiver would be limited to communications at the time of adoption, and would not infect the advice given by litigation counsel...|$|R
40|$|Recently, Renault (2016) {{studied the}} dual bin packing {{problem in the}} per-request advice model of online algorithms. He showed that given O(1 /ϵ) advice bits for each input item allows {{approximating}} the dual bin packing problem online to within a factor of 1 +ϵ. Renault asked about the advice complexity of dual bin packing in the tape-advice model of online algorithms. We make progress on this question. Let s be the maximum bit size of an input item weight. We present a conceptually simple online algorithm that with total <b>advice</b> <b>O(s</b> + n/ϵ^ 2) approximates the dual bin packing to within a 1 +ϵ factor. To this end, we describe and analyze a simple offline PTAS for the dual bin packing problem. Although a PTAS for a more general problem was known prior to our work (Kellerer 1999, Chekuri and Khanna 2006), our PTAS is arguably simpler to state and analyze. As a result, we could easily adapt our PTAS to obtain the advice-complexity result. We also consider whether the dependence on s is necessary in our algorithm. We show that if s is unrestricted then for small enough ϵ > 0 obtaining a 1 +ϵ approximation to the dual bin packing requires Ω_ϵ(n) bits of advice. To establish this lower bound we analyze an online reduction that preserves the advice complexity and approximation ratio from the binary separation problem due to Boyar et al. (2016). We define two natural advice complexity classes that capture the distinction similar to the Turing machine world distinction between pseudo polynomial time algorithms and polynomial time algorithms. Our results on the dual bin packing problem imply {{the separation of the}} two classes in the advice complexity world...|$|R

This relation between physical and auxiliary metric boils down to a conformal transformation in the case of f(R) theories. We also show with explicit models that the inclusion of Ricci-squared terms in the action can impose upper bounds on the accessible values of pressure and density, which might have important consequences for the early time cosmology and black hole formation scenarios. Our results indicate that the phenomenology of f(R,R mu nu R mu nu) theories is much richer than that of f(R) and f(R mu nu R mu nu) theories and that they also share some similarities with Bekenstein's relativistic theory of MOND.

Mother, I suppose you {{got a letter from}} me Saturday last, as I sent one the day before, as I was {{concerned}} about Andrew. If I thought it would be any benefit to Andrew I should certainly leave everything else and come back to Brooklyn. Mother, do you recollect what I wrote last summer about throat diseases, when Andrew was first pretty bad? Well, that's the whole groundwork of the business; any true physician would confirm it. There is no great charm about such things; as to any costly and mysterious baths, there are no better baths than warm water, or vapor (and perhaps sulphur vapor). There is nothing costly or difficult about them; one can have a very good sweating bath, at a pinch, by having a pan of warm water under a chair with a couple of blankets around him to enclose the vapor, and heating a couple of bricks or stones or anything to put in one after another, and sitting on the chair--it is a very wholesome sweat, too, and not to be sneezed at if one wishes to do what is salutary, and thinks of the sense of a thing, and not what others do. Andrew mustn't be discouraged; those diseases are painful and tedious, but he can recover, and will yet. Dear mother, I sent your last letter to George, with a short one I wrote myself. I sent it yesterday. I sent a letter last Wednesday (14th) to him also, hoping that if one don't reach him another will. Hasn't Jeff seen Capt. Sims or Lieut. McReady yet, and don't they hear whether the 51st is near Nicholasville, Kentucky, yet? I send George papers now and then. Mother, one of your letters contains part of my letter to the Union (I wish I could have got the whole of it). It seems to me mostly as I intended it, barring a few slight misprints. Was my last name signed at the bottom of it? Tell me when you write next. Dear mother, I am real sorry, and mad too, that the water works people have cut Jeff's wages down to $50; this is a pretty time to cut a man's wages down, the mean old punkin heads. Mother, I can't understand it at all; tell me more of the particulars. Jeff, I often wish you was on here; you would be better appreciated--there are big salaries paid here sometimes to civil engineers. Jeff, I know a fellow, E. C. Stedman; has been here till lately; is now in Wall street. He is poor, but he is in with the big bankers, Hallett & Co., who are in with Fremont in his line of Pacific railroad. I can get his (Stedman's) address, and should you wish it any time I will give you a letter to him. I shouldn't wonder if the big men, with Fremont at head, were going to push their route works, road, etc., etc., in earnest, and if a fellow could get a good managing place in it, why it might be worth while. I think after Jeff has been with the Brooklyn w[ater] w[orks] from the beginning, and so faithful and so really valuable, to put down to $50--the mean, low-lived old shoats! I have felt as indignant about it, the meanness of the thing, and mighty inconvenient, too--$40 a month makes a big difference. Mother, I hope Jeff won't get and keep himself in a perpetual fever, with all these things and others and botherations, both family and business ones. If he does, he will just wear himself down before his time comes. I do hope, Jeff, you will take things equally all round, and not brood or think too deeply. So I go on giving you all good <b>advice.</b> <b>O</b> mother, I must tell you how I get along in my new quarters. I have moved to a new room, 456 Sixth street, not far from Pennsylvania avenue (the big street here), and not far from the Capitol. It is in the 3d story, an addition back; seems to be going to prove a very good winter room, as it is right under the roof and looks south; has low windows, is plenty big enough; I have gas. I think the lady will prove a good woman. She is old and feeble. (There is a little girl of 4 or 5; I hear her sometimes calling Grandma, Grandma, just exactly like Hat; it made me think of you and Hat right away.) One thing is I am quite by myself; there is no passage up there except to my room, and right off against my side of the house is a great old yard with grass and some trees back, and the sun shines in all day, etc., and it smells sweet, and good air--good big bed; I sleep first rate. There is a young wench of 12 or 13, Lucy (the niggers here are the best and most amusing creatures you ever see)--she comes and goes, gets water, etc. She is pretty much the only one I see. Then I believe the front door is not locked at all at night. (In the other place the old thief, the landlord, had two front doors, with four locks and bolts on one and three on the other--and a big bulldog in the back yard. We were well fortified, I tell you. Sometimes I had an awful time at night getting in.) I pay $10 a month; this includes gas, but not fuel. Jeff, you can come on and see me easy now. Mother, {{to give you an idea}} of prices here, while I was looking for rooms, about like our two in Wheeler's houses (2nd story), nothing extra about them, either in location or anything, and the rent was $60 a month. Yet, quite curious, vacant houses here are not so very dear; very much the same as in Brooklyn. Dear mother, Jeff wrote in his letter latter part of last week, you was real unwell with a very bad cold (and that you didn't have enough good meals). Mother, I hope this will find you well and in good spirits. I think about you every day and night. Jeff thinks you show your age more, and failing like. O my dear mother, you must not think of failing yet. I hope we shall have some comfortable years yet. Mother, don't allow things, troubles, to take hold of you; write a few lines whenever you can; tell me exactly how things are. Mother, I am first rate and well--only a little of that deafness again. Good-bye for present.|$|R
40|$|PAE Team’s Objectives Ø Create {{a survey}} {{instrument}} {{to assess the}} impact of technology intervention in rural India Ø Advise on potential applications for village-level Internet terminals The aim of the Sustainable Access in Rural India (SARI) project is to improve the lives of individuals in poor rural communities by leveraging information and communications technologies to facilitate economic development. Ultimately, the project’s success will be measured by its social and economic impact and viability, which depends critically on the appropriateness of applications provided to end-users. Our conclusions and recommendations concerning applications are as follows: A price application that posts the daily price fluctuations of certain goods in order to promote competition among sellers and improve the economic decision making of villagers and traders may not increase efficiency or further economic development; its effectiveness depends critically on geographic scope and a focus on goods whose prices exhibit sufficient price volatility and differentiation. We recommend a central web sitebased price application, with independent kiosk operators responsible for inputting price information from villages in which markets exist. A spot labor market application that aggregates supply and demand of jobs for clusters of villages holds much promise—there are potential benefits from coordinating labor markets in the area studied. The relatively constant need for work coupled with unmet demand suggests that there is a significant willingness to pay for a service that matches supply and demand for labor in a timely and accountable way. We recommend a bulletin-board type labor market application that connects small numbers of nearby villages. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY iv An agriculture application that addresses the basic knowledge needs of farmers, providing weather forecasts and information on farming techniques must include tailored content, given the diversity of crops grown and methods employed throughout the region. We recommend a local content creation mechanism, facilitating farmer access to agricultural expertise via simple voice or text communications, or a more robust web-based application. Deficiencies in the current state-provided healthcare infrastructure may limit the initial impact of IT within local Public Health Centers (PHCs). Instead, we suggest a health care application that delivers information and services to villagers directly through community centers. Based on villager awareness levels and needs, we recommend a government services application that would enable villagers to access information on relevant government programs and initiate online requests for necessary government documents. While applications to facilitate education (particularly adult learning) may be useful, there appear to be significant implementation barriers at the school level. The motivation for these proposed applications stems from several regional attributes, inferred from local economic data and extensive interviews with villagers, school representatives, health workers and NGO staff members: Ø Many if not most villages exhibit segregation along religious and/or caste lines. Ø While some data is readily available and disseminated (e. g., prices of heavily traded goods), other potentially critical pieces of information are not easily accessible to villagers (e. g., livestock prices, agricultural <b>advice,</b> government programs). <b>Ø</b> A majority of all economic activity either directly or indirectly involves agriculture, and much of a typical villager’s social activity relates to agriculture. Ø A majority of laborers are without a regular source of employment—unemployment is extremely cyclical, reaching high levels during the agricultural off-season.

40|$|Dissertation {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Quality in the Faculty of Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2013 Many top performing businesses, which achieve superior levels of success and sustainability, have a sound, implemented, and well maintained, Quality Management System (QMS). The correlation between business success and an implemented management system {{has been shown in}} numerous papers. This research, which culminates in a quantitative measure of QMS performance, was conducted at Eskom’s Koeberg Nuclear Power Station (KNPS). The power station is the operating leg of the Koeberg Operating Unit (KOU). The researcher is a QMS lead auditor in the KNPS Quality Assurance Department. A program of audits is planned based on the KOU quality and safety manual and the national regulatory licencing requirements. The audit monitoring program is then implemented over a three year period and considers all the management system processes which impact on nuclear safety and business performance. The individual audits each consider ISO 9001 criteria in context of the business area audited. Each major business area (e. g. design, maintenance, etc.) within the power station adheres to all generic ISO 9001 QMS clauses and considerations, such as documentation management, records management, etc. Each process or business area audit is thus effectively a QMS audit. The audit results, when combined are therefore a representative measure of the overall organisational QMS performance. The potential value to be gained from the audit results and data accrued over the monitoring period has not been optimised to maximise the return on investment to Eskom. The research problem statement thus proposes that the performance measurement capability of the quality management system at Eskom's Koeberg Power Station is insufficient. This diminishes management's ability to identify business risk resulting from management system deficiencies, which impacts negatively on business performance. The research question seeks to determine how the performance measurement capability of the QMS can be improved to assist management in identifying business risk resulting from quality management system deficiencies in order to improve business performance. The research objectives are supported by the literature study, which identifies the quality management methods currently used in order to measure and subsequently improve business performance. It also shows how QMS performance measurement, when deconstructed and analysed can provide the required insight for supporting management decision making. The research approach is considered inductive in that a theory is developed based on the collection and the analysis of that data. Applied research, will thus serve as the basis of the research methodology as it is considered the most appropriate research approach, based on the need to answer practical questions around the measurement of QMS performance philosophy. The research shows that by introducing additional theming and severity data into the secondary audit findings data, it is possible over time to extract high level strategic direction information when analysing the additional metadata. The dimensions and value of the QMS Performance measuring instrument are: Ø A cause and effect theming philosophy of audit findings providing an additional context to business improvement <b>advice</b> to management. <b>Ø</b> The provision of a QMS process deficiency locator / identifier which targets management action areas for improvement. Ø The provision of a quantitative measure of the management system performance, providing a reference from which to improve. By providing a quantifiable measure of an organisations QMS performance, a reference point is provided to gauge QMS performance and also render a definitive measure to enable performance improvement of the business...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} 50 years {{there has been}} a rapid {{increase}} in global landings of cephalopods (octopus, squid and cuttlefish). In European waters, cuttlefish are among the most important commercial cephalopod resources and within the North-East Atlantic, the English Channel supports the largest cuttlefish fishery, with the common cuttlefish, Sepia o cinalis (Linnaeus, 1758), dominating landings. S. o cinalis has a short (2 year) life cycle in the English Channel that is punctuated by seasonal migrations inshore and o shore. Using a combination of di erent métiers including beam trawling, otter trawling and coastal trapping, this shared fisheries resource is targeted at nearly every phase of the life cycle. Despite this continuing increase there remain only minimal management measures in place, with no quotas, no total allowable catches, no closed areas, no minimal landing size and no routine assessment of stocks. In order to provide sustainable fisheries management <b>advice</b> for S. <b>o</b> cinalis populations it is essential that a thorough understanding of the ecology and life history of this species, in particular the factors a ecting spawning and recruitment variability, is attained. In this thesis, I examine critical gaps in our understanding of the distribution, movements, habitat use and behaviours of spawning and sub-adult S. o cinalis. This research provides baseline data for this species within the inshore waters of the English Channel and uses a combination of novel field-based electronic tracking techniques, in situ subtidal observations of spawning patterns within natural environments and presence-only species distribution modelling. A maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modelling approach was used to predict the distribution of benthic egg clusters using presence-only data. The model showed very good performance in terms of predictive power and accuracy (test area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [AUC] = 0. 909) and among the explanatory variables used to build the model, depth (gain = 1. 17), chlorophyll-a concentration (used here as a proxy for turbidity; gain = 1. 06) and distance from coastline (gain = 1. 02) were shown to be the greatest determining factors for the distribution of S. o cinalis spawning. As part of the model output, maps (logistic and binary) of the predicted spawning distribution of S. o cinalis within the English Channel were produced. Subtidal observation were undertaken at spawning grounds on both the North and South coast of the English Channel to investigate spawning habitat and structure use. A total of 15 types of natural spawning structures were identified. The range of spawning structures used varied among sites with Zostera marina identified as the dominant spawning structure at two of the UK sites (Torbay and Poole Bay), potentially indicating a ‘preference’ for this structure within localities. Fractal dimension analysis of the seagrass beds at Torbay revealed that the spatial dynamics of seagrass beds within this site varied significantly between 2011 and 2012 (Mann- Whitney U: Z = 4. 92, P < 0. 0001) as a result of both anthropogenic and natural disturbance. Interannual changes in the spatial dynamics of these beds could a ect the annual pattern and intensity of spawning at a site. The use of structures with small diameters was found to occur, with cuttlefish adapting the device to their requirements by utilising multiple leaves or thalli in order to achieve a suitable diameter for egg attachment, this was evident in their use of both Chorda filum and Z. marina. This research also provided the first data on the fine-scale movements and behaviours of adult and sub-adult individuals, tracked within their natural environments, using electronic tagging methodologies. That expected patterns of short-term spawning site fidelity at a local level were observed in only two individuals, whilst larger scale movements (up to 35 km) along the coastline were observed in three individuals, indicated that a range of behaviours and movement patterns could occur among spawning adults. Similarly varied patterns of site fidelity were also observed in tagged sub-adults, tracked over an extended period (up to 73 days), using a static acoustic array. These results highlight the complex range of patterns and plasticity in behaviour that exist within natural populations. In summary, a series of di erent approaches was used within this thesis in an e ort to improve our understanding of the fine-scale movement, behaviours and habitat use of S. o cinalis (in both spawning adults and non spawning sub-adults), as well as their potential spawning distribution within the inshore waters of the English Channel. Observing the movements and behaviours of small marine animals like S. o cinalis in their natural environments has traditionally been di cult. Recent developments in technologies and techniques however, including those used within this thesis (e. g. electronic tagging), have highlighted the potential capacity of novel tools to monitor the in situ movements and behaviour of cuttlefish. By providing important insights into the ecology of this species these new tools can aid conservation and management advice for this important commercial fishery species, both within the English Channel and further afield.
