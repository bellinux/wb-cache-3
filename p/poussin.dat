5|$|Taylor and his Secretary of State, John M. Clayton, both lacked {{diplomatic}} experience, {{and came}} into office at a relatively uneventful time in American–international politics. Their shared nationalism allowed Taylor to devolve foreign policy matters to Clayton with minimal oversight, although no decisive foreign policy was established under their administration. As opponents of the autocratic European order, they vocally supported German and Hungarian liberals in the revolutions of 1848, although they offered {{little in the way}} of aid. A perceived insult from the French minister Guillaume Tell <b>Poussin</b> nearly led to a break in diplomatic relations until <b>Poussin</b> was replaced, and a reparation dispute with Portugal resulted in harsh words from the Taylor administration. In a more positive effort, the administration arranged for two ships to assist in the United Kingdom's search for a team of British explorers, led by John Franklin, who had gotten lost in the Arctic. While previous Whig administrations had emphasized Pacific trade as an economic imperative, the Taylor administration took no major initiative in the Far East.|$|E

5|$|Miles {{purchased}} the art collection of Richard Hart Davis and others. The mansion eventually housed {{a collection of}} over a hundred paintings representing many Old Masters – Domenichino (including the St John the Evangelist sold in 2009 for £9.2 million), Titian, <b>Poussin,</b> Michelangelo, Raphael, Rubens, Claude Lorrain (including the Altieri Claudes) and Van Dyke, as well as numerous family portraits, however {{the majority of the}} more famous paintings were sold between 1884 and 1898. In the middle of the 19th century it was possible to visit the house to view the art collection on Thursday afternoons upon application to the Miles family's business offices at 61 Queen Square, Bristol (formerly the house of Philip John Miles's father, William Miles).|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} Scottish landscape painting {{are in the}} tradition of Scottish house decoration for burgesses, lairds and lords, that arose after the Reformation in the sixteenth century, partly {{as a response to the}} loss of religious patronage. Most were of heraldry, classical myths and allegory, but there were a number of painted landscape scenes. These included the landscapes of four seasons in the Skelmorlie Aisle (1638) in the memorial chapel of the Montgomery family in Largs undertaken by James Stalker (fl. 1632–38). They indicate an awareness of contemporaneous Dutch landscape painting. The Flemish artist Alexander Keirincx (1600–52) was active in England and Scotland where he undertook commissions for Charles I, mainly of royal castles in Northern England and Scotland. These included one showing Seton House (1636–37) in its landscape, which is often said to be the earliest surviving painted landscape created in Scotland. The theme of house decoration with landscapes was taken up in the eighteenth century by James Norie (1684–1757), who worked beside the architect William Adam (1689–1748). Norie, with his sons James (1711–36) and Robert (d. 1766), painted the houses of the peerage with capriccios or pastiches of Italian and Dutch landscapes, bringing to Scotland the influence of French artists such as Claude Lorrain and Nicolas <b>Poussin.</b> The Nories were also important figures in professionalisation of Scottish art and the development of art education.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Poussin's death, his style had a strong influence on French art, thanks in particular to Charles LeBrun, who had studied briefly with <b>Poussin</b> in Rome, and who, like <b>Poussin,</b> became a court painter for the King and later {{the head of the}} French Academy in Rome. Poussin's work had an important influence on the 17th-century paintings of Jacques Stella and Sébastien Bourdon, the Italian painter Pier Francesco Mola, and the Dutch painter Gerard de Lairesse.|$|E

25|$|Each one of Poussin's {{paintings}} told a story. Though he {{had little}} formal education, <b>Poussin</b> became very knowledgeable in the nuances of religious history, mythology and classical literature, and, usually after consulting with his clients, took his subjects from these topics. Many of his paintings combined several different incidents, occurring at different times, into the same painting, in order to tell the story, and the affetti, or facial expressions of the participants, showed their different reactions. Aside from his self-portraits, <b>Poussin</b> never painted contemporary subjects.|$|E

25|$|His early {{sketches}} gained him a {{place in}} the studios of established painters. He worked for three months in the studio of the Flemish painter Ferdinand Elle, who painted almost exclusively portraits, a genre that was of little interest to <b>Poussin.</b> He moved next to the studio of Georges Lallemand, but Lallemand's inattention to precise drawing and the articulation of his figures apparently displeased <b>Poussin.</b> However, <b>Poussin</b> did not fit well into the studio system, where several painters worked on the same painting. Thereafter he preferred to work very slowly and alone. Little is known of his life in Paris at this time. Court records show that he ran up considerable debts, which he was unable to pay. He studied anatomy and perspective, but the most important event of his first residence in Paris was his discovery of the royal art collections, thanks to his friendship with Alexandre Courtois, the valet de chambre of Marie de Medicis. There he saw for the first time engravings of the works of Giulio Romano and especially of Raphael, whose work had an enormous influence on his future style.|$|E

25|$|The {{middle of}} the eighteenth century saw a turn to Neoclassicism in France, that is to say a {{conscious}} use of Greek and Roman forms and iconography. This movement was promoted by intellectuals like Diderot, in reaction to the artificiality and the decorative essence of the rocaille style. In painting, the greatest representative of this style is Jacques-Louis David, who, mirroring the profiles of Greek vases, emphasized the use of the profile. His subject matter often involved classical history such as the death of Socrates and Brutus. The dignity and subject matter of his paintings were greatly inspired by Nicolas <b>Poussin</b> in the seventeenth century. <b>Poussin</b> and David were in turn major influences on Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres. Other important neoclassical painters of the period are Jean-Baptiste Greuze and Joseph-Marie Vien. Neoclassicism also penetrated decorative arts and architecture.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, some art critics {{suggested}} that the analytic Cubist experiments of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque were also founded upon Poussin's example.

40|$|Abstract: We studied energy {{expenditure}} in adult Black-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa tridoctyla) with doubly labeled water to measure energy costs of chick rearing. We removed eggs from randomly selected nests and compared energy expen-diture {{late in the}} chick-rearing period between adults raising chicks and adults whose eggs had been removed. Adults raising chicks expended energy at a rate 21 % higher than adults from manipulated nests, apparently owing to differ-ences in activity patterns while away from the colony. No sex-specific differences were detected in energy costs of chick rearing or {{energy expenditure}}, although statistical power for these analyses was fairly low. Among the unmanipulated group, energy expenditure tended to be positively related to natural brood size. An ancillary goal of our study was to test hypotheses that describe how population-level field metabolic rates (FMRs) vary during chick rearing. We compared FMRs among kittiwakes raising chicks at a colony in Alaska (61 ° 09 ¢ N) with those reported for a colony in Norway (76 ° 30 ¢ N). FMRs of adults raising chicks were nearly identical at the two colonies, suggesting that adults may have preferred levels of energy expenditure during chick rearing that are relatively invariant with environmental conditions, and that are not adjusted according to adult survival probabilities.

6000|$|... § XXXVIII. I {{have not}} written in vain if I have {{heretofore}} done anything towards diminishing {{the reputation of}} the Renaissance landscape painting. But the harm which has been done by Claude and the <b>Poussins</b> is as nothing when compared to the mischief effected by Palladio, Scamozzi, and Sansovino. Claude and the <b>Poussins</b> were weak men, and have had no serious influence on the general mind. There is little harm in their works being purchased at high prices: their real influence is very slight, and they may be left without grave indignation to their poor mission of furnishing drawing-rooms and assisting stranded conversation. Not so the Renaissance architecture. Raised at once into all the magnificence of which it was capable by Michael Angelo, then taken up by men of real intellect and imagination, such as Scamozzi, Sansovino, Inigo Jones, and Wren, it is impossible to estimate the extent of its influence on the European mind; and that the more, because few persons are concerned with painting, and, of those few, the larger number regard it with slight attention; but all men are concerned with architecture, and have at some time of their lives serious business with it. It does not much matter that an individual loses two or three hundred pounds in buying a bad picture, but it is to be regretted that a nation should lose two or three hundred thousand in raising a ridiculous building. Nor is it merely wasted wealth or distempered conception which we have to regret in this Renaissance architecture: but we shall find in it partly the root, partly the expression, of certain dominant evils of modern times--over-sophistication and ignorant classicalism; the one destroying the healthfulness of general society, the other rendering our schools and universities useless to a large number of the men who pass through them.|$|R
25|$|During the French Revolution, Poussin's {{style was}} championed by Jacques-Louis David {{in part because}} the leaders of the Revolution looked to replace the frivolity of French court art with Republican {{severity}} and civic-mindedness. The influence of <b>Poussin</b> was evident in paintings such as Brutus and Death of Marat. Benjamin West, an American painter of the 18th century who worked in Britain, found inspiration for his canvas of The Death of General Wolfe in Poussin's The Death of Germanicus.|$|E
25|$|Art {{from this}} period shows {{influences}} from both the north of Europe, namely the Dutch and Flemish schools, and from Roman painters of the Counter-Reformation. Artists in France frequently debated the contrasting merits of Peter Paul Rubens with his the Flemish baroque, voluptuous lines and colors to Nicolas <b>Poussin</b> with his rational control, proportion, Roman classicism. Another proponent of classicism working in Rome was Claude Gellée, known as Le Lorrain, who defined the form of classical landscape.|$|E
25|$|In 1609, Annibale {{died and}} was buried, {{according}} to his wish, near Raphael in the Pantheon of Rome. It {{is a measure of}} his achievement that artists as diverse as Bernini, <b>Poussin,</b> and Rubens praised his work. Many of his assistants or pupils in projects at the Palazzo Farnese and Herrera Chapel would become among the pre-eminent artists of the next decades, including Domenichino, Francesco Albani, Giovanni Lanfranco, Domenico Viola, Guido Reni, Sisto Badalocchio, and others.|$|E
5000|$|In 1963, George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 5th Duke of Sutherland, his {{distant cousin}} 'Geordie', died, leaving no {{immediate}} male heir. Egerton succeeded to the dukedom, {{but did not}} inherit the Sutherland estates or Dunrobin Castle, which went to Elizabeth Janson, Geordie's niece, who became the Countess of Sutherland. [...] Estate duty forced the Duke to sell many pieces from the family's renowned collection of paintings and drawings. The family's wealth had shifted from landholdings to an estimated £120m collection of paintings which included Raphaels, Titians, Tintorettos, <b>Poussins,</b> and {{a large part of}} the famous Orléans collection from the Palais Royal in Paris. The wealth had come from the acquisitions of the first Duke of Bridgewater, who built the famous canal and passed on his mining riches, and from intermarriage. Benjamin Disraeli once paid tribute to the family's [...] "talent for absorbing heiresses".|$|R
5000|$|He liked small {{pictures}} and {{was reported to}} have said that [...] "A man did not deserve a good picture that would not carry it home himself". As a result, he spent less on his collection than other collectors who preferred bigger, more expensive paintings. For example, he did not buy on a par with his grandson, Charles, the 4th Duke of Rutland, friend and patron of Sir Joshua Reynolds. Nevertheless, he was a serious collector whose eye and temperament led him to buy smaller works of all the major European painters including Raphael, Titian, Bassano, Veronese, Guido Reni, and the Italianate northerners, especially Claude and the two <b>Poussins.</b> He is known to have spent some £3,210 for paintings but this figure must be taken as approximate and open to revision if new records come to light. By way of comparison, the building of his London townhouse in the same period, cost some £4,432.|$|R
60|$|Of which shortcomings, {{the chief}} is the want of {{reference}} to {{the landscape of the}} <b>Poussins</b> and Salvator; my original intention having been to give various examples of their mountain-drawing, that it might be compared with Turner's. But the ten years intervening between the commencement of this work and its continuation have taught me, among other things, that Life is shorter and less availably divisible than I had supposed: and I think now that its hours may be better employed than in making facsimiles of bad work. It would have required the greatest care, and prolonged labor, to give uncaricatured representations of Salvator's painting, or of any other work depending on the free dashes of the brush, so as neither to mend nor mar it. Perhaps in the next volume I may give one or two examples associated with vegetation; but in general, I shall be content with directing the reader's attention to the facts in nature, and in Turner; leaving him to carry out for himself whatever comparisons he may judge expedient.|$|R
