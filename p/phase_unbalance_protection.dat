The first part represents a theoretical introduction to points at issue. In the first part, the reader will get conceived with the communication standard IEC 61850 and its typical architecture for MV switchgear, and also with data model based on this standard. Second part discusses the PROFIBUS communication protocol. In this part, the reader can acquire information about transmit technology and communication protocol for PROFIBUS. Last part of this theoretical chapter contains an overview on the MODBUS communication. The second part {{deals with the}} description of protection relays, which {{were used for the}} purposes of this thesis. In the first subchapter, the reader can learn about the REM 620 from ABB Company, its configuration and cooperation with IEC 61850 standard. Second subchapter describes the HMS Anybus communication converter. The reader will get further knowledge about description of this device and how to configure the communication protocols. In last subchapter, a description of protection relay SIPROTEC 7 SJ 64 produced by Siemens company is explained. With the third part starts the practical work within this thesis with protection relays. This chapter is divided into two parts; each describes different system with using the protection relays. First system contains ABB REM 620 relay and HMS Anybus converter. By converting MODBUS protocol with the Anybus converter, the REM 620 can be connected to PROFIBUS network. This part includes the configuration of REM 620 and Anybus converter, the engineering of MODBUS and PROFIBUS protocols and testing various signals in those networks. The second system contains Siemens SIPROTEC 7 SJ 64 and ethernet switch. This subchapter deals with the preparation of configuration for SIPROTEC 7 SJ 64 and the engineering for IEC 61850 communication. This part finishes with the comparing of both systems on the engineering bases. The last part of this thesis is about working with the LabVIEW instrument. Within this part, the software emulation of protection relay was made. The program offers to the user the possibility of setting input parameters as the effective values of current and voltage, the frequency and the current phase shift. Also the user can set the thresholds for protection functions, such as the Overcurrent, the Voltage and the Frequency protection. As last one, the <b>Phase</b> <b>unbalance</b> <b>protection</b> for the current phases is present...|$|E
50|$|A unique {{feature of}} the station was its {{relatively}} high tolerance for <b>phase</b> <b>unbalance</b> situations, necessary due {{to the use of}} two-phase furnaces in the zinc smelter conflicting with the power plant's generation of three-phase alternating current. The plant was originally intended to house two 55 MW generators, but larger generators capable of handling a higher degree of <b>phase</b> <b>unbalance</b> were deemed necessary. The final solution was to install 65 MW generators on the originally planned 55 MW turbines. Switches were later installed in the power plant's control room that gave operators the ability to remotely trip the smelter's furnaces during severe <b>phase</b> <b>unbalances</b> in order to prevent damage to the generators or the plant's auxiliary equipment.|$|R

The VSS can effectively eliminate and control the <b>phase</b> voltage <b>unbalance,</b> which is caused by phase-to-ground capacity unbalance. The system enables to automatically maintain phase-to-ground capacity unbalance of the network in the range of assigned parameters, and thus provides the network with symmetrical phase voltage in the assigned range as well. In particular cases, the VSS can be used for artificial increase in <b>phase</b> voltage <b>unbalance</b> of the network, mostly for a short-time period during earth-fault localization in the network.|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} battery storage systems {{includes}} technology {{choices for the}} batteries and for the inverter. The impact of the inverter design on the optimal design and operation of the storage system has not been analysed before. Therefore four inverter designs are compared with this research. The most basic inverter model assumes only symmetric active power exchange; the most advanced inverter model allows interphase active power transfer and reactive power control. A multi-objective optimisation method is used, to visualise the trade-offs between two technical objective functions for cycling control – voltage regulation and peak power reduction – for a given annual cost. The method is applied to a real-world scenario, based on an existing feeder in a residential part of a city in Flanders, Belgium. Internal losses and losses in the grid are quantified for the different designs. Modelling a battery storage system purely as a finite source/sink of active power in a low-voltage grid, strongly underestimates the potential because of the existing <b>phase</b> <b>unbalance.</b> Counteracting <b>phase</b> <b>unbalance</b> through an inter-phase power transfer capable inverter, {{even more so than}} adding reactive power control, improves the performance of battery storage systems. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{heuristic}} backtracking search {{algorithm is}} proposed to adjust the phasing arrangement of primary feeders and laterals for phase balancing of distribution systems. The <b>phase</b> <b>unbalance</b> index of distribution feeders {{is calculated based on}} the phasing current magnitude of each line segment and branch, which has been solved by a 3 -phase load flow program. The database of an outage management system (OMS) is used to retrieve the component attributes and the topology process is executed to determine the electrical network configuration and the customers served by each distribution transformer. By using the monthly energy consumption of customers in customer information system (CIS) and the typical daily load patterns of customer classes, the hourly loading profiles of distribution transformers and service zones can be derived to solve the individual phase loadings of each primary feeder and lateral. The phase balancing of distribution systems is enhanced by heuristic rule-based searching process to minimize the <b>phase</b> <b>unbalance</b> index. To demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed methodology, a practical distribution feeder with 2754 customers is selected for computer simulation to enhance three-phase balancing of distribution systems. It is concluded that three-phase balancing of distribution systems can be obtained by considering customer load characteristics...|$|R

Several possible issues that might arise from the described smart grid developments are already recognised, these include frequent peak loads that reduce headway, voltage drops and <b>phase</b> <b>unbalance.</b> Due {{to the complexity of}} human societies, any predictions on the uptake of EVs and photovoltaics (PVs) comes with large uncertainties.

A relative, multiplexable measurement of electric field by comparison of the <b>phase</b> <b>unbalance</b> between linear modes on and off resonance is proposed, yielding static resolutions of 24 V and 18 mV respectively in unpoled (dc Kerr effect) and poled (Pockels effect) fibres...|$|R
40|$|Capítulos en librosHigh-speed {{trains are}} more and more widely used around the world. They are {{commonly}} installed in interconnected power systems by connecting each traction substation directly in different nodes among the network. The single-phase loads of high-speed railway systems do not produce excessive dangerous <b>phase</b> to <b>phase</b> <b>unbalances</b> in these robust networks. However, if high-speed trains are to be used in small isolated power systems, such as islands or non-interconnected power systems, problems of unacceptable <b>phase</b> to <b>phase</b> <b>unbalances</b> may appear. This is due to the small size of the system and its relatively weak network, that lead to a low short-circuit power in their nodes. This paper studies the impact of high-speed trains in small isolated power systems. Two different connections proposed by the infrastructure manager are analyzed. These connections try to reduce the impact of the railway network in power system network unbalances. Both connection schemes have been tested in a real small isolated power system in which a high-speed railway system is expected to be installed by the year 2018. Representative peak and valley scenarios for this year have been used in the analysis. The results obtained evidence that small isolated power systems are very sensitive to the incorporation of high-speed trains in their weak networks since high unbalances are obtained. Moreover, the results allow the selection of the connection that is more capable of reducing power system unbalances. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

Instantaneous reactive power theory shows that DC-bus capacitor power will fluctuate at twice mains frequency during any unbalanced operation.

Based on finite element (FE) method, the rotor system attached with two disks and pin shape stators are simulated by Timoshenko beam. The circular stator is simulated by a lumped mass model, and the rotor and stator are connected {{by one or more}} point point contact elements to establish the dynamic model of the rotor stator coupling system. Assuming that the rubbing is caused by the sudden impact excitation and sudden unbalance excitation under two loading conditions (condition 1 : in <b>phase</b> <b>unbalances</b> of two disks at the first critical speed, condition 2 : out of <b>phase</b> <b>unbalances</b> of two disks at the second critical speed), the system dynamic characteristics are analyzed by the time domain waveform, rotor orbit, normal contact/rubbing force and stator acceleration. The results show that the rubbing caused by the sudden impact under the loading condition 2 will always exist and the rubbing will excite quasi periodic motion of the rotor system; combination frequency components about the rotating frequency (1 ×) and the first lateral natural frequency of the rotor stator coupling system (f_n 1) can be viewed as the most distinguishable characteristic. Full annular rubbing may appear due to the sudden unbalance excitation under the loading condition 1, the four point rubbing can restrain the subsynchronous vibration and mainly excites odd multiple frequency components, such as 3 × and 5 ×...|$|R

Its detection performance is shown to outperform traditional detectors that rely on changes in only a subset of positive, negative and zero sequence voltages. Unbalance detection is formulated as a hypothesis test under a framework of detection theory and solved by applying a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT).

In [5], the major technical impacts of small PV installations were discussed. This included excessive reverse power flow, overvoltages along distribution feeders, increased difficulty of voltage control, increased power losses (caused by reverse power flow) and severe <b>phase</b> <b>unbalance.</b>|$|R
