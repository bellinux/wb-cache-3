Good economic conditions and high demand for nickels for use in coin-operated devices caused the piece to circulate throughout the nation by 1900. That year, Mint Director George E. Roberts called on Congress to quintuple the Mint's appropriation to purchase base metals for striking into nickels and cents. At the time, statutory restrictions <b>permitted</b> <b>production</b> of cents and nickels only at Philadelphia; Roberts' request that Congress allow striking at the other mints was granted in 1906.

50|$|By contrast, the British {{economy at}} the time of the Industrial Revolution was much smaller and less {{efficient}} than China's. Local shortages could not be readily alleviated by internal trade; besides being far smaller than China, Britain lacked an efficient internal water-based trade network, which prompted the development of the steam engine and railroads. The early paucity of arable farmland in Britain encouraged technical refinements to improve crop yields at an early date, whereas the vast size of China <b>permitted</b> <b>production</b> to be increased simply by cultivating more land until late in the imperial period. Although overseas colonies provided cheap labor during the Industrial Revolution, local labor in Britain itself was more expensive than in China, providing the capitalist class an incentive to improve worker efficiency.|$|E

Train loading operations at the mine are done with a batch weigh bin system that is coupled to a [...] "weigh-in-motion" [...] track scale system. Silo capacity at the mine's rail loop, which can accommodate up to 5 unit trains, is 46,000 tons.

5000|$|In 1901, Prohibition in Canada began {{through a}} provincial {{legislation}} in Prince Edward Island. In 1916, prohibition was instituted in Ontario as well, affecting all 64 breweries in the province. Although some provinces totally banned alcohol manufacture, some <b>permitted</b> <b>production</b> for export to the United States. Labatt survived by producing full strength beer for export {{south of the}} border and by introducing two [...] "temperance ales" [...] with less than two per cent alcohol for sale in Ontario. However, the Canadian beer industry suffered a second blow when Prohibition in the United States began in 1919. When Prohibition was repealed in Ontario in 1926, just 15 breweries remained and only Labatt retained its original management. This resulted in a strengthened industry position. In 1945, Labatt became a publicly traded company with the issuance of 900,000 shares.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the oil and}} gas industry, it {{took into}} account {{production}} in other states, in effect bringing total available supply, (including imports, which were small) within the principle of prorationing to market demand. Allowable oilfield production was calculated as follows: estimated market demand, minus uncontrolled additions to supply, gave the Texas total; this was then prorated among fields and wells in a manner calculated to preserve equity among producers, and to prevent any well from producing beyond its Maximum Efficient Rate (MER). Scheduled allowables are expressed in numbers of calendar days of <b>permitted</b> <b>production</b> per month at MER. In the Spring of 2013, new hydraulic fracturing water recycling rules were adopted in the state of Texas by the Railroad Commission of Texas. The Water Recycling Rules are intended to encourage Texas hydraulic fracturing operators to conserve water used in the hydraulic fracturing process for oil and gas wells.|$|E

We explore the effects of production smoothing on several system performance metrics. ...|$|R
25|$|Pharmaceutical {{residues}} {{may reach}} the environment {{by a number}} of different routes. It is generally assumed (albeit hardly verified) that the production of pharmaceuticals in industrialised countries is well controlled and unharmful to the environment, due to the local legal restrictions usually required to <b>permit</b> <b>production.</b> However, a substantial fraction of the global production of pharmaceuticals takes place in low-cost production countries like India and China. Recent reports from India demonstrate that such production sites may emit very large quantities of e.g. antibiotics, yielding levels of the drugs in local surface waters higher than those found in the blood of patients under treatment.|$|R

50|$|Glass art was {{a medium}} in which Art Nouveau found new and varied ways of expression. Intense amount of {{experimentation}} went on, particularly in France, {{to find new}} effects of transparency and opacity: in engraving win cameo, double layers, and acid engraving, a technique which <b>permitted</b> <b>production</b> in series. The city of Nancy became an important center for the French glass industry, and the workshops of Emile Gallé and the Daum studio, led by Auguste and Antonin Daum, were located there. They worked with many notable designers, including Ernest Bussière, Henri Bergé, and Amalric Walter. They developed a new method of incrusting glass by pressing fragments of different color glass into the unfinished piece. They often collaborated with the furniture designer Louis Majorelle, whose home and workshops were in Nancy. Another feature of Art Nouveau {{was the use of}} stained glass windows with that style of floral themes in residential salons, particularly in the Art Nouveau houses in Nancy. Many were the work of Jacques Gruber, who made windows for the Villa Majorelle and other houses.|$|E
5000|$|One {{of these}} powers was {{establishing}} licenses for growers of Port wine grapes and dictating limits or [...] "quotas" [...] {{for what could}} be harvested. These quotas (known as the beneficio) would change with each vintage depending {{on the quality of}} the vintage and on the current conditions of the wine market. These measures were enacted to ensure that the market wasn't flooded with Port and that the wines that were available were of high quality and not something that could tarnish the reputation of the Douro. Over the years the system of licensing growers turned into a rating classification operated by the IVDP. The system only pertains the production of Port. A quinta that is growing grapes for both Port and table wines, can do whatever they like with the grapes destined for table wine production regardless of its classification rating. Each year the IVDP classifies and rates the vineyards on an A-F scale with A being the highest level. A quinta's rating will dictate the <b>permitted</b> <b>production</b> level of the vineyard and what price the grower can receive for the wine they produce from the grapes.|$|E

Chimeras encoding the EntP signal peptide (SP(entP)) fused to mature EntA (entA), with or without its immunity gene (entiA), were cloned into the expression vector pMG 36 c to generate the recombinant plasmids, pMPA 15 (SP(entP) :entA) and pMPA 10 i (SP(entP) :entA + entiA). Transformation of competent L. lactis subsp. lactis IL 1403 and L. lactis subsp. cremoris NZ 9000 with the recombinant plasmids <b>permitted</b> <b>production</b> of EntA by the transformed cells, and the co-production of nisin A and EntA by the L. lactis subsp. lactis DPC 5598 transformants. Mature EntA fused to SP(EntP) is the minimum requirement for synthesis, processing and secretion of biologically active EntA in L. lactis. The production of EntA by most recombinant L. lactis hosts was larger than in the E. faecium control strains. All L. lactis derivatives showed antimicrobial activity against Listeria spp., and L. lactis (pMPA 15) displayed the highest antilisterial effect...|$|E
