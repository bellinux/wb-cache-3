40|$|Aims: The {{study of}} {{production}} and morphological characteristics of seeds allows identifying the different seeds mixed with cultivated plant; it also allows knowing the various species of weeds in fields. So such studies help to develop different strategies to control weeds. Methodology: The work on the identification starts by collecting seeds from fields then study it thoroughly in the laboratory where researchers often observe it by naked eyes, {{in addition to the}} reliance on references and researches concerning describing seeds to make the study effective and successful it must be conducted carefully with continual vigilance because of the smallness of some seeds so we use magnifying glass, the optical microscope and <b>pocket</b> <b>lamp</b> to see the different external parts of seeds. Results: Generally, members of the species Brassicaceae have small seeds with mostly less than 4 mm long. Seeds can have appendages or not. The seed shape among the investigated species showed wide range of variations. Most of the seeds vary from globose to oblong or oval. The largest seed size is 2. 8 - 3. 5 x 0. 7 - 1. 1 mm in oval and globose seeds. Seed surface may be smooth, glabrous, or rough that can be useful for identifying species. The seed colour varies from dark reddish,brown to golden red-brown, reddish-brown to dark brown,yellow dark to brown,yellow,shiny brown,Brown dark to black,range-rown, red-brown, grey, black. The production of seeds varies depending on the culture in which the weed grows. Seed production was determined for 10 weed species of Brassicaceae. Studies on seed production potential in Capsella bursa-pastoris, Conringia orientalis, Diplotaxis erucoides and Diplotaxis virgata showed that each plant produces an average of 2500 ± 480, 7800 ± 627, 2200 ± 308 and 3600 ± 48 seeds respectively. Hirschfeldia incana produces 14000 ± 279 seeds /plant whereas Neslia paniculata produces 1540 ± 526 seeds/Plant. One isolated Sinapis arvensis plant can produce over 1200 ± 398 seeds. Thus Rapistrum rugosum produced 280 ± 17 seeds per plant. Conclusion: Seeds morphological description is related to external description of seed, weeds seeds show very big differences as well as seeds of the same species which also can show many morphological differences. The ability to produce seeds with different degrees of dormancy is, most probably, a mechanism by which species of Brassicaceae as other weed species adapts to new environmental situations and ensures its survival by facilitating the dispersal of its seeds in time and space...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} develop a simple and rapid test {{that can be used}} to {{diagnose}} Buruli ulcer under field conditions, we modified the conventional LAMP assay by using a disposable pocket warmer as a heating device for generating a constant temperature for the test reaction and employed the use of crude sample preparations consisting of boiled and unboiled extracts of the clinical specimen instead of using purified DNA as the diagnostic specimen. Thirty clinical specimens from suspected Buruli ulcer patients were investigated by the modified <b>LAMP</b> (or <b>pocket</b> warmer <b>LAMP)</b> and the conventional LAMP, as well as IS 2404 PCR, a reference method for the detection of Mycobacterium ulcerans. There was no significant difference in the detection rate (63 – 70 %) in all of the methods when purified samples were used for the tests. On the other hand the use of crude specimen preparation resulted in a drop in detection rate (30 – 40 %). This study demonstrates that the LAMP test can be used for rapid detection of M. ulcerans when purified DNA preparations are used. With further improvements in the sample reaction, as well as in specimen purification, the <b>pocket</b> warmer <b>LAMP</b> may provide a simple and rapid diagnostic test for Buruli ulcer...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Seed {{characters}} are very helpful for {{identification of a}} large number of species or genera. In many cases, morphological characteristics, germination and production of seeds, can be used to distinguish species and varieties. Methodology: Study it thoroughly in the laboratory where researchers often observe it by naked eyes, in addition to the reliance on references and researches concerning describing seeds to make the study effective and successful it must be conducted carefully with continual vigilance because of the smallness of some seeds so we use magnifying glass, the optical microscope and <b>pocket</b> <b>lamp</b> to see the different external parts of seeds. Germination of seeds was carried out in laboratory under different temperature (5 °C, 10 °C, 15 °C, 20 °C, 25 °C, 30 °C). Production of abundant small seeds is a common adaptation that ensures a high probability of dispersal and re-infestation. Eight characteristics were used to identify eight species of seeds which belong to Poaceae family. The morphological characteristics in which the study was based on are: shape, color, size (length, breadth), solidity, brightness, surface, appendages, weight per 100 seeds. Considerable differences were noticed between the various species of weeds seeds. Results: The seeds of the family have great variation in their seed mass and size, considered one of the important factors affecting germination percentage and production rate. Germination percentages ranged from 80 % to 100 %, depending on the species and temperature. The highest germination percentages were reached at alternating temperatures (05 °C/ 30 °C). Studies on seed production potential in Bromus sterilis, Bromus rubens, Bromus lanceolatus and Bromus madritensis showed that each plant produces an average of 3700 ± 637, 5000 ± 592, 3000 ± 380 and 4500 ± 426 seeds respectively. Lolium rigidum produces 950 ± 304 seeds /plant whereas Lolium multiflorum produces 900 ± 258 seeds/Plant. One isolated Avena sterilis plant can produce over 235 ± 14 seeds. Thus Avena alba produced 64 ± 15 seeds per plant. Each weeds species shows morphological characteristics different from the plant or other species, these morphological characteristics are not restricted to the external form of the plant only but it can be on level of different other parts of plant like fruit and seed. Conclusion: The study showed that the seeds morphological characteristics can be helpful in identification of species. The ability to produce seeds with big capacity of germination is, most probably, a mechanism by which species of Poaceae as other weed species adapts to new environmental situations and ensures its survival by facilitating the dispersal of its seeds in time and space...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Buruli ulcer (BU) {{caused by}} Mycobacterium ulcerans (M. ulcerans) {{has emerged as}} an {{important}} public health problem in several rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are important in preventing disfiguring complications associated with late stages of the disease progression. Presently there is no simple and rapid test that is appropriate for early diagnosis and use in the low-resource settings where M. ulcerans is most prevalent. METHODOLOGY: We compared conventional and pocket warmer loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) methods (using a heat block and a pocket warmer respectively as heat source for amplification reaction) {{for the detection of}} M. ulcerans in clinical specimens. The effect of purified and crude DNA preparations on the detection rate of the LAMP assays were also investigated and compared with that of IS 2404 PCR, a reference assay for the detection of M. ulcerans. Thirty clinical specimens from suspected BU cases were examined by LAMP and IS 2404 PCR. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The lower detection limit of both LAMP methods at 60 °C was 300 copies of IS 2404 and 30 copies of IS 2404 for the conventional LAMP at 65 °C. When purified DNA extracts were used, both the conventional LAMP and IS 2404 PCR concordantly detected 21 positive cases, while the <b>pocket</b> warmer <b>LAMP</b> detected 19 cases. Nine of 30 samples were positive by both the LAMP assays as well as IS 2404 PCR when crude extracts of clinical specimens were used. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The LAMP method {{can be used as a}} simple and rapid test for the detection of M. ulcerans in clinical specimens. However, obtaining purified DNA, as well as generating isothermal conditions, remains a major challenge for the use of the LAMP method under field conditions. With further improvement in DNA extraction and amplification conditions, the pwLAMP could be used as a point of care diagnostic test for BU...|$|R
