5|$|Responding to the book's publication, the Association of the British <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>Industry</b> {{issued a}} {{statement}} in 2012 arguing that the examples the book offers were historical, that the concerns had been addressed, that the industry {{is among the most}} regulated in the world, and that it discloses all data in accordance with international standards.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, some {{amino acids}} {{derivatives}} {{are used in}} <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>industry.</b> They include 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) used for experimental treatment of depression, L-DOPA (L-dihydroxyphenylalanine) for Parkinson's treatment, and eflornithine drug that inhibits ornithine decarboxylase and used {{in the treatment of}} sleeping sickness.|$|E
5|$|Such {{reactions}} {{are believed to}} go via an imidoyl chloride; in certain cases where it is stable, the imidoyl chloride is the final product. For example, pyridones and pyrimidones {{can be converted to}} chloro- derivatives of pyridines and pyrimidines, which are important intermediates in the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E

5|$|Commercially, {{thallium}} {{is produced}} not from potassium ores, {{but as a}} byproduct from refining of heavy metal sulfide ores. Approximately 60–70% of thallium production {{is used in the}} electronics industry, and the remainder is used in the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>industry</b> and in glass manufacturing. It is also used in infrared detectors. The radioisotope thallium-201 (as the soluble chloride TlCl) is used in small, nontoxic amounts as an agent in a nuclear medicine scan, during one type of nuclear cardiac stress test.|$|E

5|$|The <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>industry</b> has {{roots in}} the apothecary shops of Europe in the 1800s, where pharmacists {{provided}} local traditional medicines to customers, which included extracts like morphine, quinine, and strychnine. Therapeutically important drugs like camptothecin (from Camptotheca acuminata, used in traditional Chinese medicine) and taxol (from the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia) were derived from medicinal plants. The Vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, used as anti-cancer drugs, were discovered in the 1950s from the Madagascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the post-communist period, the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>industry</b> has mainly been an {{obstacle}} to reform. Aiming to explore the vast market of the former USSR, they used the situation to make professionals and services totally dependent on their financial sustenance, turned the major attention to the availability of medicines rather than that of psycho-social rehabilitation services, and stimulated corruption within the mental health sector very much.|$|E
5|$|When a {{compound}} has limited {{solubility in water}} it is common practice (in the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>industry,</b> for example) to determine pKa values in a solvent mixture such as water/dioxane or water/methanol, in which the compound is more soluble. In the example shown at the right, the pKa value rises steeply with increasing percentage of dioxane as the dielectric constant of the mixture is decreasing.|$|E

5|$|In {{material}} sciences, many complicated inorganic and organometallic {{systems have}} been analyzed using single-crystal methods, such as fullerenes, metalloporphyrins, and other complicated compounds. Single-crystal diffraction is also used in the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>industry,</b> due to recent problems with polymorphs. The major factors affecting the quality of single-crystal structures are the crystal's size and regularity; recrystallization is a commonly used technique to improve these factors in small-molecule crystals. The Cambridge Structural Database contains over 800,000 structures as of September 2016; over 99% of these structures were determined by X-ray diffraction.|$|E
5|$|Lilly's {{greatest}} {{contributions to}} the industry were his standardized and methodical production of drugs, his dedication to research and development, and the therapeutic value of the drugs he created. As {{a pioneer in the}} modern <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>industry,</b> many of his innovations later became standard practice. Lilly's ethical reforms, in a trade that was marked by outlandish claims of miracle medicines, began a period of rapid advancement in the development of medicinal drugs. During his lifetime, Lilly had advocated for federal regulation on medicines; his son, Josiah, continued that advocacy following his father's death.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Lilly was an {{advocate}} of federal regulation of the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>industry,</b> {{and many of his}} suggested reforms were enacted into law in 1906, resulting {{in the creation of the}} Food and Drug Administration. He was also among the pioneers of the concept of prescriptions, and helped form what became the common practice of giving addictive or dangerous medicines only to people who had first seen a physician. The company he founded has since grown into one of the largest and most influential pharmaceutical corporations in the world, and the largest corporation in Indiana. Using the wealth generated by the company, his son, J. K., and grandsons, Eli Jr. and Josiah Jr. (Joe), established the Lilly Endowment in 1937; it remains as one of the largest charitable benefactors in the world and continues the Lilly legacy of philanthropy.|$|E

5|$|In 1915, Conant {{entered into}} a {{business}} partnership with two other Harvard chemistry graduates, Stanley Pennock and Chauncey Loomis, to form the LPC Laboratories. They opened a plant in a one-story building in Queens, New York, where they manufactured chemicals used by the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>industry</b> like benzoic acid that were selling at high prices {{on account of the}} interruption of imports from Germany due to World War I. In 1916, the departure of organic chemist Roger Adams created a vacancy at Harvard that was offered to Conant. Since he aspired to an academic career, Conant accepted the offer and returned to Harvard. On November 27, 1916, there was an explosion at the plant. Pennock and two other workers were killed and the plant was completely destroyed. One of the contributing causes was Conant's faulty test procedures.|$|E
5|$|Further {{support for}} the {{association}} between autism and thiomersal appeared in an article by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. in the magazines Rolling Stone and Salon.com alleging a government conspiracy at a CDC meeting to conceal the dangers of thiomersal to protect the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>industry,</b> and a book written by David Kirby, Evidence of Harm, dramatizing the lives of parents of autistic children, with both authors participating in media interviews to promote their work and the controversy. Although the allegations by Kennedy were denied and a US Senate committee investigation later found no evidence to substantiate the most serious allegations, the story had already been well publicized by leveraging Kennedy's celebrity. Salon magazine subsequently amended Kennedy's article five times due to factual errors and later retracted it completely on January 16, 2011, stating that the works of critics of the article and evidence of the flaws in the science connecting autism and vaccines undermined {{the value of the}} article to the editors.|$|E
5|$|Indiana became {{politically}} {{influential and}} {{played an important}} role in the Union during the American Civil War. Indiana was the first western state to mobilize for the war, and its soldiers participated in almost every engagement during the war. Following the Civil War, Indiana remained politically important as it became a critical swing state in U.S. Presidential elections. It helped decide control of the presidency for three decades. During the Indiana Gas Boom of the late 19thcentury, industry began to develop rapidly in the state. The state's Golden Age of Literature began in the same time period, increasing its cultural influence. By the early 20th century, Indiana developed into a strong manufacturing state and attracted numerous immigrants and internal migrants to its industries. It experienced setbacks during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Construction of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, expansion of the auto industry, urban development, and two wars contributed to the state's industrial growth. During the second half of the 20thcentury, Indiana became a leader in the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>industry</b> due to the innovations of companies such as Eli Lilly.|$|E
