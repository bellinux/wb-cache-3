5|$|He {{recognised}} German {{skill in}} constructing trench parapets: by {{making use of}} an irregular top and face to the <b>parapet,</b> and constructing it from material of varying composition, {{the presence of a}} sniper or an observer poking his head up became much less conspicuous. In contrast, British trench practice had been to give a military-straight neat edge to the <b>parapet</b> top, making any movement or protrusion immediately obvious.|$|E
5|$|At Cape Town's Castle of Good Hope, {{the flag}} was flown from the castle {{alongside}} the Union Jack, {{flag of the}} Netherlands and the current flag of South Africa to display the powers that ruled South Africa through history. In 1994 {{it was agreed that}} they would remain on the castle <b>parapet</b> as historical reference. In 2012 following complaints from the ANC member of parliament Nomfunelo Mabedla, all the flags were removed from the <b>parapet</b> apart from the current flag of South Africa and the removed flags were placed in the castle's museum.|$|E

40|$|Photograph of {{the home}} of Wiltcie B. Ames, a Mission Revival {{architecture}} building, 2433 Flower Street, Los Angeles, 1880 - 1920. The two-story building features Spanish tiled roofs, multicurved <b>parapets,</b> and an arcade walkway. The adjacent walls {{at the corner of}} the building both have multicurved <b>parapets.</b> The windows beneath the <b>parapets</b> have window wells with plants in them. To the right is an arcade walkway. Several other multicurved <b>parapets</b> are visible at right. At left, a set of stairs leads to another arcade walkway where above it is a balcony. Other houses are visible in the background...|$|R
50|$|Improvements to {{the bridge}} <b>parapets</b> to bring them up to modern {{standards}} were carried out by Hertfordshire Council from July to September 2008. The work included installing 'high containment' <b>parapets</b> above the railway.|$|R
50|$|Symmetrically {{arranged}} {{the building is}} rectangular in plan with central projecting bays on the west and east elevation. Decorative <b>parapeted</b> gables form {{the facade of the}} projecting bays. The <b>parapets</b> conceal the gabled roof which abuts them.|$|R

5|$|The column or trunk is {{generally}} {{more or less}} cylindrical and may be plain and smooth or may bear specialist structures; these include solid papillae (fleshy protuberances), adhesive papillae, cinclides (slits) and small protruding vesicles. In some species the part immediately below the oral disc is constricted and {{is known as the}} capitulum. When the animal contracts, the oral disc, tentacles and capitulum fold inside the pharynx and are held in place by a strong sphincter muscle part way up the column. There may be a fold in the body wall, known as a <b>parapet,</b> at this point, and this <b>parapet</b> covers and protects the anemone when it is retracted.|$|E
5|$|The most {{noticeable}} {{feature of the}} fort is the circular keep. This was modeled on the reduit de surete of the Lunette d'Arçon, and it also bears similarities to the tour-reduits built in Malta in the early 18th century (the only surviving example is Vendôme Tower). It had two rows of musketry loopholes, and its roof contained a <b>parapet</b> with four embrasures. The latter was replaced with a sloping <b>parapet</b> to mount a single gun in the 1860s. The keep also contains the main gate, above which is a commemorative plaque.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} frontage to College Road {{has three}} double-storeyed projecting bays with <b>parapeted</b> gables and corner buttresses to the Great Hall and end classrooms. The {{eastern and western}} frontages have single, central double-storeyed projecting bays, also with corner buttresses and <b>parapeted</b> gables.|$|R
50|$|The {{pavilion}} is rectangular in {{plan with}} central projecting bays {{on the east}} and west elevation. Decorative <b>parapeted</b> gables form the facade of the projecting bays. The <b>parapets</b> conceal the gabled roofs which abut them. The north and south wings of the building are hipped roofed.|$|R
50|$|Although {{regarded}} as a pioneering work, several aspects of its construction lacked durability, such as the absence of bridge deck waterproofing, low concrete cover and poor drainage. In 1975 and 1976 it was extensively repaired, the <b>parapets</b> were modified, and waterproofing was added. However, by 1991, deterioration had continued, with the <b>parapets</b> becoming unsafe. The waterproofing and drainage were replaced and amended, {{and most of the}} existing concrete surface removed and replaced by shotcrete. The <b>parapets</b> were completely rebuilt. Completed in 1998, this repair work cost 1.3 million US dollars.|$|R
5|$|The south (front) face of {{the eastern}} wing has seven bays, with a balustraded <b>parapet</b> at eaves level. The central bay is set forward to form a stone centrepiece around the arched main {{entrance}}, which is flanked by fluted Ionic columns. Immediately above the entrance are doubled tapering pilasters flanking a three-light window, all surmounted by a large cartouche decorated with strapwork. On {{the first floor of}} the central bay is a triple-mullion window, and above the <b>parapet</b> is a coat of arms. Flanking the centrepiece are two bays with diapered brickwork and single-mullion windows. The two ends of the south face are also set forward; they have canted, triple-mullion bay windows and are surmounted above the <b>parapet</b> by shaped gables with attic windows. All the main windows of this face are double transomed.|$|E
5|$|The west façade of {{the castle}} has square towers {{flanking}} the central bay, with others at the south west and north west, all topped with octagonal, machicolated turrets. The north and south façades are relatively simple. The east façade has a central projection in the centre rising a storey above the <b>parapet,</b> to form a tower. The tower's south angle is splayed to accommodate the main staircase and only the corbels of its <b>parapet</b> survive. The screen closing off the east entrance has a three-bay cusped arcade {{on the ground floor}} and three ogee arches on the shafts above.|$|E

5|$|The <b>parapet</b> {{has three}} {{horizontal}} rows of inscriptions; {{on the upper}} and lower rows is smaller lettering that is often not visible in reproductions. In places, the Greek characters are unclear and have been subject to much speculation by art historians, not least due to vanEyck's sometimes erratic spelling and unusual spacing.|$|E
5|$|The tower, {{which was}} built around 1475, has three stages {{supported}} by diagonal buttresses. Its top is surmounted by a paneled <b>parapet</b> and an ornate crown with an elaborate spirelet over the stair turret, with two tiers of arcading.|$|E

5|$|Bath Abbey was a Norman church {{built on}} earlier foundations. The present {{building}} {{dates from the}} early 16th century and shows a late Perpendicular style with flying buttresses and crocketed pinnacles decorating a crenellated and pierced <b>parapet.</b> The choir and transepts have a fan vault by Robert and William Vertue. A matching vault {{was added to the}} nave in the 19th century. The building is lit by 52 windows.|$|E
5|$|In 1739, the War of Jenkins' Ear {{broke out}} between Britain and Spain, and the {{decision}} was taken to improve the defences at Cromwell Castle. Abraham Tovey, the Master Gunner at the nearby fortification known as the Garrison, constructed a large gun-platform for a battery of six guns on the south-west side of the tower, possibly on top of any pre-existing 16th-century platform. A <b>parapet</b> protected the guns, a new entrance was cut into the main tower and other adjustments made.|$|E
5|$|In 1813, {{during the}} Napoleonic Wars, work {{was carried out}} to alter {{the design of the}} <b>parapet.</b> The Crimean War sparked a fresh {{invasion}} scare and in 1855 the south coast of England was refortified. Yarmouth Castle underwent considerable repairs that year; four naval guns and traversing rails were installed on the castle platform, and a regular county army unit was put in place to garrison the fort. In 1881 a proposal was put forward to modernise the entire fortification, but this was rejected and in 1885 the garrison and the guns were withdrawn.|$|E
