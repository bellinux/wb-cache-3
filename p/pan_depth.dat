40|$|Ergonomics (also called {{human factors}} engineering) {{is the study}} of human {{characteristics}} for the appropriate design of the living and work environment. It is applied in various industrial areas which includes transportation. Tricycle being {{one of the most common}} means of public transportation in Lipa City has various adaptations to suit the culture, and environment. The purpose of this study is to analyze the variability in design of the tricycles in Lipa City, Philippines and propose a standard ergonomically designed tricycle sidecar seat for a greater population. The study was conducted at 26 tricycle terminals with 232 tricycle samples within Lipa City proper including the public market area where 400 commuters were given questionnaires to determine the risk factors associated with the existing tricycle sidecar seat design. Anthropometric measurements of 100 males and 100 female commuters were obtained together with the sidecar dimensions of 232 tricycles to substantiate the observed variations in design. Using the design for the average and design for the extremes, it was found out that most of the tricycles in Lipa City, Philippines have inappropriate inclined seat and lowered sidecar seat pan height which can result to leg and abdominal pain; narrowed seat <b>pan</b> <b>depth</b> which caused pressure on buttocks and legs; narrowed backrest width which can cause upper and low back pain; low backrest height that can pose upper back pain; which can also result to abdominal pain; inclined backrest and limited vertical clearance which can cause upper back pain and neck pain. The researcher proposed a sidecar seat design standard which can be used by the Land Transportation Office, and Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board to provide ease, comfort, and convenience to the passengers...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMusculoskeletal {{disorders}} (MSDs) {{have been}} common complaints among workers involved in static work or tasks requiring the repetitive {{motion of the}} upper limbs and prolonged computer work. Call center workers are the one group which may impact on chronic musculoskeletal health problems. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to assess ergonomics risk for MSDs in work environment among call center workers. This was a survey study conducted among 216 call center workers in Khon Kaen province, Thailand. Call center workers who had experience jobs more than 6 months, working time at least 32 hours per week with computer at least 4 hours per days. Data were collected by the Rapid Office Strain Assessment (ROSA) which measured the sitting posture, workstation (chair height, <b>pan</b> <b>depth,</b> armrests, and back support), computer (monitor, mouse and keyboard), telephone and duration of spending time for each posture or activity. From ROSA, there were 4 levels of ergonomics risk classification (low, medium, high, very high). The results of this study showed that the call center workers were only at 2 level of risk (high and medium). The majority of the call center workers were at high risk level (score 5 - 7 points) for 52. 3 % (mean score 5. 3, 95 %CI: 5. 2 - 5. 4). The medium risk level (score 3 - 4 points) was 47. 7 % (mean score 3. 6, 95 %CI: 3. 5 - 3. 7). The top three highest frequencies of score of ergonomics risk were 5 points, followed by 4 points and 3 points which were at 37. 5 %, 28. 2 % and 19. 4 %, respectively. The mean score of that risk was 4. 5 (95 % CI: 4. 4 - 4. 6). By using the ROSA, this study showed that most of the call center workers were exposed to the high ergonomics risk for MSDs development. For prevention of MSDs, there should be ergonomics training for workers to be aware of ergonomics factors in the office. The personal working behaviors and the design of the workstations should be improved based on the ergonomics principles...|$|E

40|$|The development, construction, and {{operation}} of the Colonie Landfill Leachate Management System (LLMS) was first conceived as a two-year project in 1987, but took {{more than six years}} to reach the final reporting stage, during which time substantial regulatory hurdles were encountered and overcome. During the summer of 1987, a work plan for the project was developed. It was determined that a pilot leachate-spraying study should be undertaken to provide additional information on the potential environmental impacts due to surface runoff and moisture front penetration through the landfill cap. To achieve this, a { 1 / 4 }-acre (100 ` x 100 `) test area was prepared and equipped with a single leachate spray head, a collection point for runoff, a rain gage, and four <b>pan</b> lysimeters (at <b>depths</b> of 6 inch, 12 inch, 18 inch, and 24 inch) to measure moisture advancement through the cap.

40|$|Introduction: Different {{models of}} {{tractors}} have been imported from foreign countries or assembled in Iran for many years. Consistency of foreign manufactured products with native specifications and {{the improvement of}} locally manufactured tractors are important problems that must be considered. Moreover, tractor dimensions, sitting space and some other important {{factors such as the}} ability of Iranian users to operate them must be taken into consideration. In this study, we surveyed the proper proportion of tractors dimension, location of control tools and driver’s work space, with Iranian users’ anthropometric data of drivers from five provinces. Human factors are of paramount importance in developing farm machinery given that these machines will often be operated by persons with minimum skills. Therefore, farm machinery should be made simple to operate and as free from hazards as possible. Materials and methods: Firstly, the anthropometric data for 250 users 20 - 60 years old was calculated. The drivers were selected randomly. Then the specifications of 4 tractors including: Ferguson 285, Ferguson 399, Valtra and New Holland were compared with the anthropometric data of user in 5 th and 95 th percentile value and their adaptation was studied. Anthropometric Data of subjects consisted of: standing height, full hand length, popliteal length, seat pan width, seat <b>pan</b> <b>depth,</b> elbow height, seat back support height, hand pan width, hand grip and full-leg length. Getting on the tractor is the first contact of an operator with a tractor. In assessing the suitability of the provision made for getting on the tractor, an experiment was arranged in which operators tried to get on 3 tractors. The mode of getting on the tractors, the agony on the operator’s face, the muscular reactions and individual opinion on the difficulties or comfort while undertaking the task were observed and recorded. The specifications of tractors compared with Anthropometric Data were measured, whiles the tractors were positioned on a level ground for measurements after the tires had been ganged. These specifications were tractor height, steering wheel height, footrest height, foot set height; tractor seat geometry as seat pan width, seat <b>pan</b> <b>depth</b> and seat pan support height; steering geometry as distance of steering wheel from seat reference point, steering wheel radius, steering wheel thickness, steering wheel inclination to the horizontal and seat reach adjustment; levers and pedals distance from seat reference point as gear lever, parking brake lever, hydraulic control lever, clutch pedal, accelerator pedal, brake pedal, front panel, workspace width and workspace length. Results and Discussion: The experiment that was conducted with operators attempting to get on the tractors indicated that tractor steps heights were higher than the desirable limit. Therefore, based on the ideas of the researcher and tractors drivers, getting on all tractors is difficult. With {{an increase in the number}} of steps or a decrease in their heights, the desirable condition can be created. Seat depth of new Holland and Valtra tractors were great for drivers in the 5 th percentile value. A variable thickness pad can solve this problem. Results of studies indicated that Seat depth of Massey Ferguson 285 and 399 was shorter than driver’s leg length of 95 th percentile value. To solve the problem an increase of 10 centimeters to pad height of these tractors was suggested. Seat pad of tractors were short for drivers in the 95 th percentile value. Distance of steering wheel from seat reference point (SRP) in Massey Ferguson 285 and Valtra was further than drivers hand length in the 5 th percentile value. Therefore, the drivers hand is short for driver’s good operation. Surveys indicated that drivers had problems for gear lever access in Massey Ferguson 399. Therefore, for good access on gear lever we must increase seat stroke range by 5 - 10 centimeters. The record available from Meteorological Organization indicated that air temperature and rain throughout the year in the study area is between 20 to 40 degrees Celsius and 100 to 300 mm change. Valtra and New Holland tractors having a driver cabs with heating and cooling equipment have the ideal space for the performance of their driver. Massey Ferguson 285 tractor does not have any driver cab and Roll Over Protection Structure (ROPS). Conclusions: This research was conducted in five provinces of Iran to assess ergonomics of some commonly and new used tractors in Iran containing Ferguson 285, Ferguson 399, Valtra and New Holland. As there was no data base with required details, data was collected directly by personal contact with tractor users. A questionnaire was filled out for each person and anthropometric data was calculated in all provinces for 250 users 20 - 60 year old that were selected at random. Then relevant specifications of 4 tractors were measured and compared with the relevant anthropometric data of users in the 5 th and 95 th percentile value and their adaptation was studied. The results indicated that tractor steps, Seat depth, distance of steering wheel and distance of some levers and pedals from seat reference point should be amended...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Prolonged sitting {{has been}} {{associated}} with musculoskeletal dysfunction. For desk workers, workstation modifications frequently address the work surface and chair. Chairs which can prevent abnormal strain of the neuromuscular system may aid in preventing musculo-skeletal pain and discomfort. Anecdotally, adjustability of the seat height and the seat <b>pan</b> <b>depth</b> to match the anthropometrics of the user is the most commonly recommended intervention. Within the constraints of the current economic climate, employers demand evidence for the benefits attributed to an investment in altering workstations, however this evidence-base is currently unclear both in terms of the strength of the evidence {{and the nature of the}} chair features. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of chair interventions in reducing workplace musculoskeletal symptoms. Methods Pubmed, Cinahl, Pedro, ProQuest, SCOPUS and PhysioFocus were searched. ‘Ergonomic intervention’, ‘chair’, ‘musculoskeletal symptoms’, ‘ergonomics’, ‘seated work’ were used in all the databases. Articles were included if they investigated the influence of chair modifications as an intervention; participants were in predominantly seated occupations; employed a pre/post design (with or without control or randomising) and if the outcome measure included neuro-musculoskeletal comfort and/or postural alignment. The risk of bias was assessed using a tool based on The Cochrane Handbook. Results Five studies were included in the review. The number of participants varied from 4 to 293 participants. Three of the five studies were Randomised Controlled Trials, one pre and post-test study was conducted and one single case, multiple baselines (ABAB) study was done. Three studies were conducted in a garment factory, one in an office environment and one with university students. All five studies found a reduction in self-reported musculoskeletal pain immediately after the intervention. Bias was introduced due to poor randomization procedures and lack of concealed allocation. Meta-analysis was not possible due to the heterogeneity of the data (differing population, intervention and outcomes across studies). Conclusion The findings of this review indicate a consistent trend that supports the role of a chair intervention to reduce musculoskeletal symptoms among workers who are required to sit for prolonged periods. However the amount, level and quality of the evidence are only moderate therefore we cannot make strong recommendations until further trials are conducted. The review also highlights gaps: for example in showing whether the effectiveness of a chair intervention has long-term impact, particularly with respect to musculoskeletal symptoms, as well as the recurrence of symptoms and the consequent cost of care. </p...|$|E

40|$|This work {{evaluated}} {{two different}} digital soil mapping methods for mapping {{the presence of}} iron pans in South-West France. The presence of iron <b>pans</b> limit rooting <b>depth,</b> thereby affecting available water content for plants and increasing vulnerability of trees to storms. In some cases, it may also limit the water infiltration rate and cause anaerobic conditions limiting rooting depth, biological activity and plant growth. This work evaluates the potential of a road-side survey sampling and subsequent digital soil mapping techniques to map the probability of iron pan presence in a French region. We tested 1) indicator kriging without taking into account ancillary covariates and compared the mapped probability with 2) logistic regression kriging which did account for ancillary covariates. The probability of iron pan occurrence was mapped at a regional level with a reasonable precision but adding ancillary co-variates to the model gave more realistic predictions. Likely, the goodness of the prediction is still hampered by {{the resolution of the}} employed DEM and by the spatial distribution of the observation points. Furthermore, we made some suggestions of the possible usage of the iron pan map; probability maps could help regional planning for forestry, agriculture and geotechnical projects...|$|R
40|$|Usually {{large numbers}} of {{measurements}} are required to describe spatial variability of soil resistance but GIS technology with interpolations methods {{make it possible to}} estimate data from unsampled locations. In this paper cone index (CI) measurements were made in two occasions in 2. 88 ha field in central Croatia to present soil condition. A commonly used tillage operation consists of ploughing (about 30 cm depth) and disc harrowing (12 - 15 cm), and they are practiced on annual basis. Measurements (240) were taken according sample grid in 48 different 24 x 25 m 2 fields. Cone index (CI) data were interpolated using geostatistical techniques (ordinary kriging) to produce the maps of soil resistance. These maps combined with expert knowledge can provide good direction for applying appropriate soil management. Our results demonstrate that the investigated layers had variable spatial structures in terms of their linear trends. This suggests that each layer has a unique spatial structure possibly as consequence of pedogenetic processes, tillage operations and changes influenced by drainage and leveling operations. The results presented here describe spatial variability of soil resistance of a drained Pseudogley of Central Croatia, measured as CI in a field conditions. Tillage practices caused the formation of a plow <b>pan</b> at a <b>depth</b> 30 – 40 cm where the maximum CI values were obtained. According to the values of penetration resistance the tillage practices should be changed if we consider improved conditions for plant roots development...|$|R
40|$|The Maresha, the {{traditional}} Ethiopian plow, requires repeated cross-plowing which causes increased surface runoff, less infiltration and hence lower water availability to crops. The {{main reasons for}} increased surface runoff and reduced infiltration are plowing along the slope {{and the formation of}} a plow <b>pan</b> at shallow <b>depths.</b> Conservation tillage is seen as a way to alleviate these problems. The widely advocated zero-tillage, however, is not feasible for smallholder farmers in semi-arid regions of Ethiopia because of difficulties in maintaining adequate soil cover, the practice of communal grazing, and high costs of herbicides. Strip tillage systems, on the other hand, may offer a solution. This study was initiated to test strip tillage systems and to evaluate the impacts of new tillage systems on the water balance and grain yields of maize. Experiments have been conducted in a semi-arid area called Melkawoba in the central Rift Valley of Ethiopia during 2003 - 2005. Strip tillage systems involved cultivation along planting lines at a spacing of 0. 75 m using the Maresha plow followed by subsoiling along the same lines (STS) or without subsoiling (ST). Results have been compared with traditional tillage involving 3 to 4 overpasses with the Maresha plow (CONV). Soil moisture has been monitored to a depth of 1. 8 m using a Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) while surface runoff has been measured using a specially designed rectangular trough installed at the bottom of each plot. STS resulted in the least surface runoff (Qs= 18 mm-season- 1) and the highest grain yields (Y= 2130 kg-ha- 1) followed by ST (Qs= 26 mm-season- 1, Y= 1840 kg-ha- 1) and CONV (Qs= 43 mm-season- 1, Y= 1720 kg-ha- 1) provided sowing was carried out within a week after subsoiling. Thus, STS resulted in the highest water productivity, WP= 0. 60 kg-m- 3, followed by ST (WP= 0. 52 kg-m- 3) and CONV (WP= 0. 48 kg-m- 3). The main conclusion of the paper is that even in dry areas reasonable yields can be obtained provided moisture conservation in the root zone is guaranteed. In this regard subsoiling is essential. Moreover, it is concluded that the time between subsoiling and planting is a key factor and should not exceed one wee...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of low-input farming systems requires {{knowledge of the}} extent to which management characteristics influence the soil as a habitat for micro-organisms and a medium for plant growth. This paper presents a study of long-term effects of organically and conventionally cultivated systems on a range of soil physical, chemical and biological characteristics in Denmark. Seven soils were included, falling into three groups (I¯III). Each group consists of an organically managed soil (Org) referenced by one or two conventionally managed soils (Conv) with the same soil type (sandy loam) and pedological history. All organically managed soils were dairy farm soils (H), which had been organically managed for 46, 47 and 40 years, respectively. They had forage crop rotations and received animal manure. The conventional soils were either dairy farm soils or soils grown to annual cash crops (P). Undisturbed core samples were used for assessing dry bulk density and water retention. Undisturbed cubic samples were used for assessing wet stability of macro-aggregates, clay dispersibility, microbial biomass C, -glucosidase activity, ergosterol, and the abundance of different groups of fungi. Penetration resistance and ease of soil fragmentation were measured in the field. The quantifying methods were supplemented by a visual inspection of soil structure of the top 30 cm soil in the field. Irrespective of agricultural system, the use of tractors and heavy machinery had caused compaction of the subsoil in the form of a dense <b>pan</b> below ploughing <b>depth.</b> In group I, the H-soils were heavily trafficked and this overshadowed the long-term effects of the diversified crop rotations and animal manure applications on the physical parameters. Generally, the results highlight the paramount influence of soil tillage and traffic in agriculture. Further, the results confirm the positive effects of organic manures and diversified crop rotations on soil quality aspects. Microbial biomass C was found to be higher in organically than in conventionally managed dairy farm soils, and appeared to correlate linearly to the volume of 0. 2 ¯ 3. 0 m pores (`protective' pore space). The simple model did, however, not explain a lower microbial biomass for two soils dressed only with synthetic fertilisers. The results further indicated that the contribution of the different biotic mechanisms responsible for macro-aggregation varied from soil to soil. The results revealed promising correlations between quantitative scientific laboratory methods and descriptive methods in the field...|$|R
