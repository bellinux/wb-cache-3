2500|$|Arnold {{made another}} {{watch for the}} King around 1768, which was a gold and enamel pair cased watch with a {{movement}} that had every refinement, including minute repetition and centre seconds motion. In addition, Arnold fitted bi-metallic temperature compensation, and not only was every <b>pivot</b> <b>hole</b> jewelled but the escapement also had a stone cylinder made of ruby or sapphire. Arnold designated this watch [...] "Number 1", {{as he did with}} all watches he made that he regarded as significant, these numbering twenty in all.|$|E
50|$|A {{jewel bearing}} is a plain bearing {{in which a}} metal spindle turns in a jewel-lined <b>pivot</b> <b>hole.</b> The hole is {{typically}} shaped like a torus and is slightly larger than the shaft diameter. The jewel material is usually synthetic sapphire or ruby (corundum). Jewel bearings are used in precision instruments where low friction, long life, and dimensional accuracy are important. Their largest use is in mechanical watches.|$|E

50|$|The castle itself sits on an {{off-shore}} rock. The rock rises 40 {{feet above}} sea level and there is a gap of 20 feet between the rock and the mainland. The gap was once spanned by a walled bridge with arches 6 feet apart. This stone walled bridge then led onto a drawbridge, the <b>pivot</b> <b>holes</b> for which are still visible on the far side. Once {{on the other side of}} the drawbridge a door opened to a flight of stairs which was also sided by two walls. The flight of stairs led up to the castle.|$|R
5000|$|The milecastle {{measures}} 78 ft long {{north to}} south and 67 ft east to west with walls approximately 10 ft wide. The north gateway survives in the front garden of Dene House and consists of twelve foundation slabs with three stone blocks lying on top. One of the blocks is marked with an asterix, two of them contain <b>pivot</b> <b>holes</b> for a gate and one shows signs of a lewis-hole. [...] The {{southern part of the}} milecastle is visible only as a 0.4m high mound in a field and part of the ditch is also visible.|$|R
5000|$|Watch {{movements}} are very standardized, and the wheel trains of most watches {{have the same}} parts. The wheel trains of clocks {{are a little more}} varied, with different numbers of wheels {{depending on the type of}} clock and how many hours the clock runs between windings (the [...] "going"). [...] However, the wheel trains of clocks and watches share the same terminology, and are similar enough that they can be described together. The large gears in timepieces are generally called wheels, the smaller gears they mesh with (large to small, large to small) are called pinions, and the shafts that the wheels and pinions are mounted on are called arbors. [...] The wheels are mounted between the plates of the movement, with the <b>pivots</b> rotating in <b>holes</b> in the plates. The <b>pivot</b> <b>holes</b> have semicircular depressions around them, called oil cups, to hold the oil in contact with the shaft by capillary action. There are several wheel trains in a typical clock or watch.|$|R
50|$|Turret 34A (Grindon West) {{exists as}} a {{consolidated}} structure, and {{is located in}} the expected position, just to the east of Sewingshields farm. It is constructed with narrow walls (approximately 0.95 m thick) having a mortar core. Like some milecastles, it has unusually short wing walls (0.9 m long and 0.6 m deep), suggesting it was constructed late in the scheme. The cores of both the wall (at this point), and the turret's wing walls are of large whinstone blocks. There is a suggestion of a platform in the southwest corner, and the door is at {{the east side of the}} south wall. it is 1.15 m in width, with a surviving (though worn and cracked) threshold stone, showing visible seating for stone jambs and <b>pivot</b> <b>hole.</b> The turret's internal dimensions are 3.9 m east/west by 2.3 m. Outside the turret, a path consisting of small stones and amphora fragments was discovered leading to the door.|$|E
50|$|The last of {{the four}} watches, 1484, does not now possess an échappement naturel but a double-wheel Robin {{escapement}}, a hybrid of the lever escapement and the chronometer escapement. Work started on the watch prior to September 1803. Sagedieu worked on an unspecified escapement between 10 February and 27 July 1804. Not much happened to the watch for six months except some jewel holes from Hooker, Breguet’s jewel specialist brought from London. Lapieur then worked on an échappement naturel {{between the end of}} January and early May 1806. From the position of the original <b>pivot</b> <b>hole</b> for the second escape wheel, the two escape wheels appear to have had a 2:1 ratio of their size. The most likely tooth counts appear to be 8:4, the same as Lapieur made earlier for watch 1085 above. The watch was cased by Tavernier in June and Herault completed the repassage in August. In November 1806, Bernaudat was paid 300 Francs for 'ouvrage et visitage'. This considerable sum could have been for the removal of the échappement naturel and the construction of its current coaxial double-wheel Robin escapement. Nothing much happened again until mid-October 1808 when Bernaudat was paid another 60 Fr for changes to the escapement. At some stage the stop-work was replaced in a new sink in the barrel cap with a standard Geneva variety rather than Breguet’s own design. No more work was done on the watch and another year and a half passed before it was sold to General Labadie on 28 Mar 1810 for the price of 1800 Francs.|$|E
40|$|A {{relatively}} simple, {{manually operated}} tool enables precise bending (typically, within 1 / 2 of the specified bend angle) of a metal tube {{located in a}} confined space, {{with a minimum of}} flattening of the tube and without significant gouging of the tube surface. The tool is designed for use in {{a situation in which the}} tube cannot be removed from the confined space for placement in a conventional benchmounted tube bender. The tool is also designed for use in a situation in which previously available hand-held tube benders do not afford the required precision, do not support the tube wall sufficiently to prevent flattening or gouging, and/or do not fit within the confined space. The tool is designed and fabricated for the specific outer diameter and bend radius of the tube to be bent. The tool (see figure) includes a clamping/radius block and a top clamping block that contain mating straight channels of semicircular cross section that fit snugly around the tube. The mating portions of the clamping/radius block and the top clamping block are clamped around a length of the tube that is adjacent to the bend and that is intended to remain straight. The clamping/radius block is so named because beyond the straight clamping section, its semicircular channel extends to a non-clamping section that is curved at the specified bend radius. A <b>pivot</b> <b>hole</b> is located in the clamping/radius block at the center of the bend circle. The tool includes a bending block that, like the other blocks, contains a straight semicircular channel that fits around the outside of the tube. The bending block contains a <b>pivot</b> <b>hole</b> to be aligned with the <b>pivot</b> <b>hole</b> in the clamping/radius block. Once the tube has been clamped between the clamping/ radius and top clamping blocks, the bending block is placed around the tube, the pivot holes are aligned, and a pivot pin is inserted through the pivot holes...|$|E
25|$|According to Spink, the {{construction}} {{activity at the}} incomplete Ajanta Caves was abandoned by wealthy patrons in about 480 CE, {{a few years after}} the death of Harishena. However, states Spink, the caves appear to have been in use {{for a period of time}} as evidenced by the wear of the <b>pivot</b> <b>holes</b> of caves constructed close to 480 CE. According to Richard Cohen, 7th-century Chinese traveler Xuanzang's reports about the caves, and the scattered graffiti from the medieval centuries uncovered at the site suggests that the Ajanta Caves were known and probably in use, but without a stable or steady Buddhist community presence at the site. The Ajanta caves are mentioned in the 17th-century text Ain-i-Akbari by Abu al-Fazl, as twenty four rock-cut cave temples each with remarkable idols.|$|R
50|$|The {{expander}} system {{consists of}} patented {{products that are}} intended {{to take the place}} of conventional pivot pins in heavy machinery and equipment. Conventional pivot pins may wear in a way that requires a costly repair process for <b>pivot</b> lug <b>holes,</b> called line boring. The expander system uses expansion sleeves that can eliminate this wear problem.|$|R
40|$|Pocket-sized {{terrestrial}} globe mounted in mahogany stand. This sphere {{consists of two}} hemispheres of paper mache joined at the equator with a wooden rod within aligned with the polar axis. The orb was then coated with plaster to which 12 gores are fixed. There are two polar calottes at latitude 70 degrees. Gores are copper engraved, hand-colored and varnished with <b>pivot</b> <b>holes</b> at both poles. The North Pole and South Poles are labeled and extensive trade winds are noted in ocean areas. Northwest Canada and America are labelled Unknown Parts but California is no longer shown as an island. Alaska is indicated with a long slender island. Australia is labelled 'New Holland' and 'Lewin' [i. e. {{in the region of}} Perth] according to Dutch discoveries but the eastern coastline is still ill defined with Diemans Land [i. e. Tasmania] joined to the mainland. Note that the unexplored east coast is represented in the typical fashion of this period as joined to New Guinea by an extended land mass labelled Carpentaria. N. Zeeland is also shown.

5000|$|As {{shown in}} the {{disassembly}} photo, the switch actuator <b>pivots</b> in two <b>holes</b> in {{the sides of the}} plastic switch body. An actuator bar slides in two grooves inside the actuator, pressed down by a compression spring into a notch in the common contact bar. The common contact bar is free to rock on a small diameter rod, welded to the common terminal. However, because of the pressure applied by the compression spring, the common contact bar will always be held against one of the two contacts.|$|R
5000|$|Cap jewels {{are always}} paired with hole jewels, and always with a conically shaped pivot. The cap jewels are so called because they [...] "cap" [...] the hole jewels {{and control the}} axial {{movement}} of the arbor, preventing {{the shoulder of the}} <b>pivot</b> contacting the <b>hole</b> jewel. For a properly designed hole and cap jewel system, the arbor pivot bears on the cap jewel as a pin point on a thin film of oil. Thus, a hole and cap jewel offer lower friction and better performance across different positions compared with simply a hole jewel.|$|R
