This continued an electronics tradition pioneered when relatively unreliable short-lived vacuum tubes had been used as active components, prior to the advance to more modern, highly reliable solid-state transistors which the Monorobot XI exploited. (Unlike vacuum tubes, which were always plugged into sockets, discrete transistors were almost always permanently soldered into place.) ...|$|E

DisplayLink USB graphics technology {{is designed to}} connect computers and displays using USB, Ethernet, and WiFi. It also allows multiple displays {{to be connected to}} a single computer. DisplayLink's primary customers are notebook OEMs (HP, Dell, Toshiba, Lenovo, Acer, Asus), LCD monitor manufacturers (AOC, ASUS) and PC accessory vendors (Startech.com, Targus, Belkin, Kensington, <b>Plugable),</b> supporting the Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Android, ChromeOS and Linux operating systems.|$|E

Group may contains one or many servers {{as well as}} physical server can contain multiple elliptics groups (replicas) stored on different backends. Groups can live in different physical locations thus allowing to server clients requests when other locations are not accessible. A peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol can be used to access data directly from storage servers without proxying. Elliptics supports server-side scripting in C++, JavaScript, Python, based on the Cocaine technology, SLRU cache and multiple <b>plugable</b> backends (eblob is the fastest for medium and large data and the most popular one).|$|E

It {{is also known}} as the Phoenix connector from one of the manufacturers, Phoenix Contact, a German company whose US operations were established in 1981 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; though there are many manufacturers who make compatible products. [...] It {{is also known as}} [...] "Combicon", which might be a Phoenix brand name; or more generically as a [...] "pluggable terminal block" [...] or a [...] "two piece terminal block".|$|E
50|$|The {{compiler}} supports <b>plugable</b> back-ends. First amongst {{these is}} LECC (Lazily Evaluating CAL Compiler). This back-end generates Java classes and byte codes directly, emitting methods according to compiler schemes that {{take account of}} context metadata derived in the compiler, such as strictness of function arguments. LECC can package generated code {{in a number of}} ways, including as a CAL Archive (CAR), or a Java JAR. At runtime, a class loader can load an entire corpus of functions, or the Quark Framework loader can load closely connected functions according to prior dependency analysis. This latter feature is important to minimise start up times, whereby only the functions actually required by an application incur loading overhead.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J 2 EE) is {{presented}} as a framework for the development of integrated, flexible and adaptive enterprise information systems. However, the J 2 EE is only a technological basis for the development of such systems. Its use is no guarantee to obtain a performant and extensible system based on integrated Business Components. In this paper we present guidelines for building enterprise information systems based on self-contained, <b>plugable</b> Business Components on top of J 2 EE. These guidelines allow also unexperienced developers to create J 2 EE-based applications that allow an easy integration of other Business Components and subsystems. Our experiences result form developing the J 2 EE-based information system CROFT...|$|E

Due to rapid advancement of Hardware as well as Software technology most of the electronic Gadgets and Gizmos are coming as USB port compatible plug and Play. As it is inconvenient to carry a computer for all the business meetings or other visits hence the USB compatable devices such as Flash Drive etc are used widely. But this USB <b>plugable</b> devices are susceptible to get damaged by a faulty USB port in a Laptop or a PC.

40|$|Various {{open-source}} toolkits {{exist for}} speech recognition and speech processing. These toolkits {{have brought a}} great benefit to the research community, i. e. speeding up research. Yet, no such freely available toolkit exists for automatic affect recognition from speech. We herein introduce a novel open-source affect and emotion recognition engine, which integrates all necessary components in one highly efficient software package. The components include audio recording and audio file reading, state-of-the-art paralinguistic feature extraction and <b>plugable</b> classification modules. In this paper we introduce the engine and extensive baseline results. Pre-trained models for four affect recognition tasks {{are included in the}} openEAR distribution. The engine is tailored for multi-threaded, incremental on-line processing of live input in real-time, however it can also be used for batch processing of databases. 1...|$|E
40|$|For {{many years}} Apache Hadoop {{has been used}} as a synonym for {{processing}} data in the MapReduce fashion. However, due to the complexity of developing MapReduce applications, adoption of this paradigm in genetics has been limited. To alleviate some of the issues, we have previously developed Cloudflow - a high-level pipeline framework that allows users to create sophisticated biomedical pipelines using predefined code blocks while the framework automatically translates those into the MapReduce execution model. With the introduction of the YARN resource management layer, new computational processing models such as Apache Spark are now <b>plugable</b> into the Hadoop ecosystem. In this paper we describe the extension of Cloudflow to support Apache Spark without any adaptions to already implemented pipelines. The described performance evaluation demonstrates that Spark can bring an additional boost for analysing next generation sequencing (NGS) data to the field of genetics. The Cloudflow framework is open source and freely available at [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Motivation: Tandem mass {{spectrometry}} {{has become a}} standard tool for identifying post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins. Algorithmic searches for PTMs from tandem mass spectrum data (MS/MS) tend to be hampered by noisy data {{as well as by}} a combinatorial explosion of search space. This leads to high uncertainty and long search-execution times. Results: To address this issue, we present PTMTreeSearch, a new algorithm that uses a large database of known PTMs to identify PTMs from MS/MS data. For a given peptide sequence, PTMTreeSearch builds a computational tree wherein each path from the root to the leaves is labeled with the amino acids of a peptide sequence. Branches then represent PTMs. Various empirical tree pruning rules have been designed to decrease the search-execution time by eliminating biologically unlikely solutions. PTMTreeSearch first identifies a relatively small set of high confidence PTM types, and in a second stage, performs a more exhaustive search on this restricted set using relaxed search parameter settings. An analysis of experimental data shows that using the same criteria for false discovery, PTMTreeSearch annotates more peptides than the current state-of-the-art methods and PTM identification algorithms, and achieves this at roughly the same execution time. PTMTreeSearch is implemented as a <b>plugable</b> scoring function in the X!Tandem search engine...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe OpenAlea {{platform}} (Pradal et al., 2008) {{was designed}} to facilitate the integration and inter-operability of heterogeneous models to get comprehensive FSPMs. It relies on Python gluing capabilities, that allow non intrusive integration of programs written in various languages (Fortran, C, C++, R, L-system); and on the dataflow computing paradigm, that promotes decomposition of applications into independent components that can be recombined dynamically into customized workflows. Still, a <b>plugable</b> collection of components is not by itself {{a solution to the}} modularity problem in FSPM modeling. First, heterogeneities between components inputs and outputs can lead to exponential needs for specific adaptors and converters to get functional assemblies. Second, several ways exist to decompose models into independent components. This can lead to incompatibilities or difficulties for re-assembly into comprehensive models. Last, users of the platform may find difficult to build applications, without some knowledge on how a simulation has to be reasoned within the data-flow computing paradigm. Here, we propose a modeling strategy to help for building coherent, yet modular FSPM under OpenAlea. We first define the key concepts of this strategy, illustrate how they can be used under Visualea and how it lead to a first set of reusable components resulting from various ecophysiological studies...|$|E
