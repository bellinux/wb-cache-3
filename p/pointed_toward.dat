5|$|Like most of Saturn's larger satellites, Enceladus rotates {{synchronously}} {{with its}} orbital period, keeping one face <b>pointed</b> <b>toward</b> Saturn. Unlike Earth's Moon, Enceladus {{does not appear}} to librate more than 1.5° about its spin axis. However, analysis of the shape of Enceladus suggests that at some point it was in a 1:4 forced secondary spin–orbit libration. This libration could have provided Enceladus with an additional heat source.|$|E
5|$|Some Augustan historians {{argue that}} {{indications}} <b>pointed</b> <b>toward</b> his sister's son Marcellus, {{who had been}} quickly married to Augustus' daughter Julia the Elder. Other historians dispute this due to Augustus' will read aloud to the Senate while he was seriously ill in 23BC, instead indicating a preference for Marcus Agrippa, who was Augustus' second in charge and arguably {{the only one of}} his associates who could have controlled the legions and held the Empire together.|$|E
5|$|To {{steer the}} canoe in mid-ocean on a {{consistent}} course, the navigator selects a star and keeps the canoe <b>pointed</b> <b>toward</b> it. Should it become cloud-blocked, or rise too high in the sky, he selects another star but offsets his reference to remain true to the first, or steers at the same relative angle to the swell as when steering toward the star.|$|E

5|$|Voyager 1 was {{constructed}} by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It has 16 hydrazine thrusters, three-axis stabilization gyroscopes, and referencing instruments to keep the probe's radio antenna <b>pointed</b> <b>toward</b> Earth. Collectively, these instruments {{are part of the}} Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS), along with redundant units of most instruments and 8 backup thrusters. The spacecraft also included 11 scientific instruments to study celestial objects such as planets as it travels through space.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} Galilean {{satellites}} and the Moon, Io rotates synchronously with its orbital period, keeping one face nearly <b>pointed</b> <b>toward</b> Jupiter. This synchronicity provides the definition for Io's longitude system. Io's prime meridian intersects the equator at the sub-Jovian point. The side of Io that always faces Jupiter {{is known as}} the subjovian hemisphere, whereas the side that always faces away {{is known as the}} antijovian hemisphere. The side of Io that always faces in the direction that Io travels in its orbit is known as the leading hemisphere, whereas the side that always faces in the opposite direction is known as the trailing hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mating}} season, rutting males move about {{in search of}} females in oestrus. Males become {{aggressive}} and fight among themselves for dominance. These fights are characterised by displays of the enlarged chest, the throat patch and the beard while holding the head upright; and threatening the opponent by running with the horns <b>pointed</b> <b>toward</b> him and circling him. The victorious bull would protect {{the vicinity of the}} targeted female from other males. The courtship typically lasts for 45 minutes. The male, stiff and composed, approaches the receptive female, who keeps her head low to the ground and may slowly walk forward. The male licks her genitalia, upon which the female holds her tail to a side and the male gives out a flehmen response. Finally, the male pushes his chest against her rump, and mounts her.|$|E

25|$|Although Color Field is {{associated}} with Clement Greenberg, Greenberg actually preferred {{to use the term}} Post-Painterly Abstraction. In 1964, Clement Greenberg curated an influential exhibition that traveled the country called Post-painterly abstraction. The exhibition expanded the definition of color field painting. Color Field painting clearly <b>pointed</b> <b>toward</b> a new direction in American painting, away from abstract expressionism. In 2007 curator Karen Wilkin curated an exhibition called Color As Field:American Painting 1950-1975 that traveled to several museums throughout the United States. The exhibition showcased several artists representing two generations of Color Field painters.|$|E

VIIs of another Jasta and Sopwith Camels, and shot one of the Camels down. The D.VII {{remained}} his mount {{for the remainder of the}} war. His had the front three-quarters of the fuselage painted black; the rear quarter was white. Emblazoned on the side was a white running stag with gold antlers and hooves, its head <b>pointed</b> <b>toward</b> the propeller.|$|E

25|$|As more {{information}} about the signal became available, its purpose as a radar signal became increasingly obvious. In particular, its signal contained a clearly recognizable structure in each pulse, which was eventually identified as a 31-bit pseudo-random binary sequence, with a bit-width of 100 μs resulting in a 3.1 ms pulse. This sequence is usable for a 100μs chirped pulse amplification system, giving a resolution of 15km (10mi) (the distance light travels in 50μs). When a second Woodpecker appeared, this one located in eastern Russia but also <b>pointed</b> <b>toward</b> the US and covering blank spots in the first system's pattern, this conclusion became inescapable.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the San Martinian Society {{requested}} to fence the monument {{after it was}} repeatedly vandalized. The request was dismissed by the city council, that considered that it would affect the aesthetics of the monument. In 2012, the municipal government of Neuquén made renewals on the monument. The Public Buildings and Transit Secretariat replaced the quicklime tiles of the roundabout for porphyr ones, that formed a sun-and-star shape. The National University of Comahue {{was in charge of}} the new illumination of the monument. On each of the twelve pointers of the star, metal cilynders were built to house lights that <b>pointed</b> <b>toward</b> the pedestal. Additional reflectors were placed on the top of the base to illuminate the statue.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 Pauling {{discovered}} that many proteins included helical (see alpha helix) shapes. Pauling had deduced this structure from X-ray patterns and from attempts to physically model the structures. (Pauling was also later to suggest an incorrect three chain helical DNA structure based on Astbury's data.) Even {{in the initial}} diffraction data from DNA by Maurice Wilkins, {{it was evident that}} the structure involved helices. But this insight was only a beginning. There remained the questions of how many strands came together, whether this number was the same for every helix, whether the bases <b>pointed</b> <b>toward</b> the helical axis or away, and ultimately what were the explicit angles and coordinates of all the bonds and atoms. Such questions motivated the modeling efforts of Watson and Crick.|$|E

25|$|Gilmour {{transferred}} the Royal Flying Corps in December 1915, and {{was awarded the}} Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate No. 2888 after soloing in a Maurice Farman biplane at the military flying school at Farnborough on 17 March 1916. He was assigned to No. 27 Squadron. They were the sole squadron equipped with the Martinsyde G.100, commonly called the Elephant. This aircraft was nicknamed for being large and ungainly. A single seater, it was too big, slow, and manoeuvrable {{to be a successful}} fighter, and without a rear gunner, too defenceless to survive well in a ground attack or bombing role. It was equipped with a Lewis machine gun mounted on the upper wing firing over the propeller, and a second one on the fuselage <b>pointed</b> <b>toward</b> the rear.|$|E
25|$|The closest {{approach}} of the New Horizons spacecraft to Pluto occurred at 11:49 UTC on July 14, 2015 at a range of 7,750 miles (12,472km) from the surface and 8,487 miles (13,658km) {{from the center of}} Pluto. Telemetry data confirming a successful flyby and a healthy spacecraft were received on Earth from the vicinity of the Pluto system on July 15, 2015, 00:52:37 UTC, after 22 hours of planned radio silence due to the spacecraft being <b>pointed</b> <b>toward</b> the Pluto system. Mission managers estimated a one in 10,000 chance that debris could have destroyed it during the flyby, preventing it from sending science data to Earth. The first details of the encounter were received the next day, but the download of the complete data set took just over 15 months, and analysis of the data will take longer.|$|E
25|$|The {{so-called}} long-duration gamma-ray bursts {{produce a}} total energy output of about 1044 joules (as much energy as our Sun will produce in its entire life-time) {{but in a}} period of only 20 to 40 seconds. Gamma rays are approximately 50% of the total energy output. The leading hypotheses for the mechanism of production of these highest-known intensity beams of radiation, are inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron radiation from high-energy charged particles. These processes occur as relativistic charged particles leave the region of the event horizon of a newly formed black hole created during supernova explosion. The beam of particles moving at relativistic speeds are focused for a few tens of seconds by the magnetic field of the exploding hypernova. The fusion explosion of the hypernova drives the energetics of the process. If the narrowly directed beam happens to be <b>pointed</b> <b>toward</b> the Earth, it shines at gamma ray frequencies with such intensity, that it can be detected even at distances of up to 10 billion light years, which is close {{to the edge of the}} visible universe.|$|E
