40|$|KEY WORDS {{community}} ecology; <b>primate</b> evolution; biogeography; community conservation ABSTRACT An {{understanding of}} the fundamental causes {{of the structure of}} <b>primate</b> communities is impor-tant for studies of <b>primate</b> evolutionary history, <b>primate</b> behavioral ecology, and development of conservation strategies. Research into these structuring factors has benefited from new perspectives such as consideration of <b>primate</b> phylogenetic history, metacommunities, and in-teractions with predators and nonprimate competitors. This review presents the underlying factors of <b>primate</b> community structure within the biogeographic regions of Madagascar, the Neotropics, Africa, and Asia. One of the major differences among these locations likely resulted from the initial <b>primate</b> taxa that colonized each region (...|$|R

5|$|Additional traits {{shared with}} other {{prosimian}} <b>primates</b> (strepsirrhine <b>primates</b> and tarsiers) include a bicornuate (two-horned) uterus and epitheliochorial placentation. Because their thumbs are only pseudo-opposable, making their movement less {{independent of the}} other fingers, their hands are less than perfect at grasping and manipulating objects. On their feet, they have a widely abducted hallux (first toe) which facilitates the grasping of tree limbs. A common misconception is that lemurs have a prehensile tail, a trait found only in New World monkeys, particularly atelids, among <b>primates.</b> Lemurs also rely heavily on their sense of smell, a trait shared with most other mammals and early <b>primates,</b> {{but not with the}} visually oriented higher <b>primates.</b> This sense of smell is important in terms of marking territory as well as provide an indication of whether or not another lemur is a viable breeding partner.|$|E
5|$|In lemuriform <b>primates,</b> the toothcomb {{has been}} used by {{scientists}} in the interpretation of the evolution of lemurs and their kin. They are thought to have evolved from early adapiform <b>primates</b> around the Eocene or earlier. One popular hypothesis is that they evolved from European adapids, but the fossil record suggests that they evolved from an older lineage that migrated to Africa during the Paleocene (66 to 55mya) and might have evolved from early cercamoniines from Asia. Fossil <b>primates</b> such as Djebelemur, 'Anchomomys' milleri, and Plesiopithecus may have been their closest relatives. The lack of a distinct toothcomb in the fossil record prior to 40mya has created a conflict with molecular clock studies that suggest an older divergence between lemurs and lorisoids, and the existence of a ghost lineage of lemuriform <b>primates</b> in Africa.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that some behaviours might be homologous, based either on sharing across related taxa or on common origins of the behaviour in an individual's development, though this remains controversial. For example, D. W. Rajecki and Randall C. Flanery, using data on humans and on nonhuman <b>primates,</b> argue that patterns of behaviour in dominance hierarchies are homologous across the <b>primates.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lemurs {{and humans}} are both <b>primates.</b> Ancestral <b>primates</b> had brown eyes, as most <b>primates</b> do today. The genetic basis of blue eyes in humans {{has been studied}} in detail and much is known about it. It {{is not the case}} that one gene locus is responsible, say with brown {{dominant}} to blue eye color. However, a single locus is responsible for about 80% of the variation. In lemurs, the difference(s) between blue and brown eyes are not completely known, but the same gene locus is not involved.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs are <b>primates</b> {{belonging}} to the suborder Strepsirrhini. Like other strepsirrhine <b>primates,</b> such as lorises, pottos, and galagos, they share ancestral (or plesiomorphic) traits with early <b>primates.</b> In this regard, lemurs are popularly confused with ancestral primates; however, lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and apes (simians). Instead, they evolved independently in isolation on Madagascar. All modern strepsirrhines including lemurs are traditionally thought to have evolved from early <b>primates</b> known as adapiforms during the Eocene (56 to 34mya) or Paleocene (66 to 56mya). Adapiforms, however, lack a specialized arrangement of teeth, known as a toothcomb, which nearly all living strepsirrhines possess. A more recent hypothesis is that lemurs descended from lorisoids (loris-like) <b>primates.</b> This is supported by comparative studies of the cytochromeb gene {{and the presence of}} the strepsirrhine toothcomb in both groups. Instead of being the direct ancestors of lemurs, the adapiforms may have given rise to both the lemurs and lorisoids, a split that would be supported by molecular phylogenetic studies. The later split between lemurs and lorises is thought to have occurred approximately 62 to 65mya according to molecular studies, although other genetic tests and the fossil record in Africa suggest more conservative estimates of 50 to 55mya for this divergence. However, the oldest lemur fossils on Madagascar are actually subfossils dating to the Late Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs are unusual among <b>primates</b> {{for their}} rapid dental development, {{particularly}} among the largest species. For example, indriids have relatively slow body growth but extremely fast tooth formation and eruption. By contrast, anthropoid <b>primates</b> exhibit slower dental development with increased size and slower morphological development. Lemurs are also dentally precocious at birth, and have their full permanent dentition at weaning.|$|E

40|$|Interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) {{proteins}} are potent antiviral factors {{shown to}} restrict the infection of many enveloped viruses, including HIV. Here we report cloning and characterization of a panel of nonhuman <b>primate</b> IFITMs. We show that, similar to human IFITM, nonhuman <b>primate</b> IFITM proteins inhibit HIV and other <b>primate</b> lentiviruses. While some nonhuman <b>primate</b> IFITM proteins are more potent than human counterparts to inhibit HIV- 1, they are generally not effective against HIV- 2 {{similar to that of}} human IFITMs. Notably, depending on SIV strains and also IFITM species tested, nonhuman <b>primate</b> IFITM proteins exhibit distinct activities against SIVs; no correlation was found to support the notion that IFITM proteins are most active in non-natural <b>primate</b> hosts. Consistent with our recent findings for human IFITMs, nonhuman <b>primate</b> IFITM proteins interact with HIV- 1 Env and strongly act in viral producer cells to impair viral infectivity and block cell-to-cell transmission. Accordingly, knockdown of <b>primate</b> IFITM 3 increases HIV- 1 replication in nohuman <b>primate</b> cells. Interestingly, analysis of DNA sequences of human and nonhuman <b>primate</b> IFITMs suggest that IFITM proteins have been undergoing purifying selection, rather than positive selection typical for cellular restriction factors. Overall, our study reveals some new and unexpected features of IFITMs in restricting <b>primate</b> lentiviruses, which enhances our understanding of virus-host interaction and AIDS pathogenesis...|$|R
5|$|The {{brains of}} humans and other <b>primates</b> contain the same {{structures}} as the brains of other mammals, but are generally larger in proportion to body size. The encephalization quotient (EQ) is used to compare brain sizes across species. It {{takes into account the}} nonlinearity of the brain-to-body relationship. Humans have an average EQ in the 7-to-8 range, while most other <b>primates</b> have an EQ in the 2-to-3 range. Dolphins have values higher than those of <b>primates</b> other than humans, but nearly all other mammals have EQ values that are substantially lower.|$|E
5|$|The {{first true}} <b>primates</b> (euprimates) {{do not appear}} in the fossil record until the early Eocene (~55mya), at which point they {{radiated}} across the Northern Hemisphere during a brief period of rapid global warming known as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. These first <b>primates</b> included Cantius, Donrussellia, Altanius, and Teilhardina on the northern continents, as well as the more questionable (and fragmentary) fossil Altiatlasius from Paleocene Africa. These earliest fossil <b>primates</b> are often divided into two groups, adapiforms (sometimes called adapids, or adapoids) and omomyiforms (or omomyids—suspected relatives of tarsiers). Both appeared suddenly in the fossil record without transitional forms to indicate ancestry, and both groups were rich in diversity and were widespread throughout the Eocene. Although few fossils of extant primate groups—lemuriforms, tarsiers, or simians—are known from the Early to Middle Eocene, evidence from genetics and newer fossil finds suggest they may have been present during this early adaptive radiation. The divergence between strepsirrhines, simians, and tarsiers likely followed almost immediately after <b>primates</b> first evolved.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the {{earliest}} <b>primates,</b> from which both the strepsirrhines and haplorhines (simians and tarsiers) evolved, is a mystery. Both their place of origin and the group from which they evolved are uncertain. Although the fossil record demonstrating their initial radiation across the Northern Hemisphere is very detailed, the fossil record from the tropics—where <b>primates</b> most likely evolved—is very poor, particularly around the time that <b>primates</b> and other major clades (groups consisting of an ancestor and all its descendants) of eutherian mammals were first appearing. Consequently, geneticists and primatologists have used genetic analyses to determine the relatedness between primate lineages {{and the amount of}} time since they diverged. Using this molecular clock, divergence dates for the major primate lineages have suggested that <b>primates</b> evolved more than 80–90mya, nearly 40million years before the first examples of which appear in the fossil record.|$|E

All <b>primates</b> have a plica sublingualis, and the fimbria linguae (plica fimbriata) found under the tongue of apes may be a vestigial version, although that is still disputed. The structure and appearance of the sublingua, frenal lamella, lingual frenulum, and other sublingual tissue vary greatly between <b>primates,</b> and as a result, their terminology is often confused.|$|E
