5|$|Some psychologists {{believe that}} 'while object <b>permanence</b> alone may not predict {{communicative}} achievement, object <b>permanence</b> {{along with several}} other sensorimotor milestones, plays a critical role in, and interacts with, the communicative development of children with severe disabilities'. This was observed in 2006, in a study recognizing where the full mastery of object <b>permanence</b> {{is one of the}} milestones that ties into a child's ability to engage in mental representation. Along with the relationship with language acquisition, object <b>permanence</b> is also related to the achievement of self-recognition. This same study also focused specifically on the effects that Down syndrome has on object <b>permanence.</b> They found that the reason why the children that participated were so successful in acquiring object <b>permanence,</b> was due to their social strength in imitation. Along with imitation being a potential factor in the success, another factor that could impact children with Down syndrome could also be the willingness of the child to cooperate.|$|E
5|$|Object <b>permanence</b> is the {{understanding}} that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be observed (seen, heard, touched, smelled or sensed in any way). This is a fundamental concept studied {{in the field of}} developmental psychology, the subfield of psychology that addresses the development of young children's social and mental capacities. There is not yet scientific consensus on when {{the understanding}} of object <b>permanence</b> emerges in human development.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the areas}} of focus on object <b>permanence</b> has been how {{physical}} disabilities (blindness, cerebral palsy and deafness) and intellectual disabilities (Down syndrome, etc.) affect the development of object <b>permanence.</b> In a study that was performed in 1975-76, {{the results showed that}} the only area where children with intellectual disabilities performed more weakly than children without disabilities was along the lines of social interaction. Other tasks, such as imitation and causality tasks, were performed more weakly by the children without disabilities. However, object <b>permanence</b> was still acquired similarly because it was not related to social interaction.|$|E
5|$|Other, {{more recent}} {{studies suggest that}} the idea of object <b>permanence</b> may not be an innate {{function}} of young children. While, in reference to Piaget's theory, it has been established that young children develop object <b>permanence</b> as they age, the question arises: does this occur because of a particular perception that already existed within the minds of these young children? Is object <b>permanence</b> really an inbred response to the neural pathways developing in young minds? Studies suggest that a multitude of variables may be responsible for the development of object <b>permanence</b> rather than a natural talent of infants. Evidence suggests that infants use a variety of cues while studying an object and their perception of the object's <b>permanence</b> can be tested without physically hiding the object. Rather, the object is occluded, slightly obstructed, from the infants view and they are left only other visual cues, such as examining the object from different trajectories. It was also found that the longer an infant focuses on an object may be due to detected discontinuities in their visual field, or the flow of events, with which the infant has become familiar.|$|E
5|$|Piaget {{concluded}} that some infants {{are too young}} to understand object <b>permanence,</b> which explains why they do not cry when their mothers are gone ("out of sight, out of mind"). A lack of object <b>permanence</b> can lead to A-not-B errors, where children reach for a thing at a place where it should not be. Older infants are less likely to make the A-not-B error because they are able to understand the concept of object <b>permanence</b> more than younger infants. However, researchers have found that A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently. They {{concluded that}} this type of error might be due to a failure in memory or the fact that infants usually tend to repeat a previous motor behavior.|$|E
5|$|Due to the <b>permanence</b> of the stent {{and small}} but {{definite}} risk of complications, most experts will recommend {{that patients with}} IIH must have papilloedema and have failed medical therapy or are intolerant to medication before stenting is undertaken.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} years, the {{original}} Piagetian object <b>permanence</b> account {{has been challenged}} {{by a series of}} infant studies suggesting that much younger infants do have a clear sense that objects exist even when out of sight. Bower showed object <b>permanence</b> in 3-month-olds. This goes against Piaget's coordination of secondary circular reactions stage because infants aren't supposed to understand that a completely hidden object still exists until they are eight to twelve months old. The two studies below demonstrate this idea.|$|E

5|$|The {{overwhelming}} {{pressure of}} mechanization {{evident in the}} newspaper and the magazine, {{has led to the}} creation of vast monopolies of communication.

5|$|Agrippa was {{extremely}} influential—as a sigil for the artistic community {{to appreciate the}} potential of electronic media—for {{the extent to which}} it entered public consciousness. It caused a fierce controversy in the art world, among museums and among libraries. It challenged established notions of <b>permanence</b> of art and literature, and, as Ashbaugh intended, raised significant problems for archivists seeking to preserve it for the benefit of future generations. Agrippa was also used as the key of a book cipher in the Cicada 3301 mystery.|$|E
5|$|The Hindu {{religion}} regards Hell {{not as a}} {{place of}} lasting <b>permanence,</b> but as an alternate domain from which an individual can return to the present world after crimes in the previous life have been compensated for. These crimes are eventually nullified through an equal punishment in the next life. The concept of Hell has provided many different opportunities for the Hindu religion including narrative, social and economic functions.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{create a}} visual {{impact in the}} same way as do other {{landscape}} features and give a sense of maturity and <b>permanence</b> to park and garden. They are grown for the beauty of their forms, their foliage, flowers, fruit and bark and their siting is of major importance in creating a landscape. They can be grouped informally, often surrounded by plantings of bulbs, laid out in stately avenues or used as specimen trees. As living things, their appearance changes with the season and from year to year.|$|E
5|$|Monson {{initiated}} French-speaking proselytizing {{efforts in}} Quebec. He directed increased missionary work to {{immigrants from the}} Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Italy, Soviet Union and Hungary. Jacob de Jager, a future LDS general authority, was among the immigrant converts. Monson encouraged members to remain in eastern Canada, instead of migrating to Utah or Alberta as many members had done before, to help build the church's presence. To help encourage members to stay in Canada, increase the perception of <b>permanence,</b> and better reach potential converts, he started a major construction program for new meetinghouses. Until then, most branches had used rented halls.|$|E
5|$|The University of Wisconsin {{faculty and}} regents voted {{to end the}} Experimental College in May 1932. There was a {{farewell}} banquet for 250 guests in June 1932. Meiklejohn did not judge the college's success by its <b>permanence,</b> {{which he did not}} expect—he said he attempted the college as a test. Meiklejohn asked Sellery to give his graduate student advisers university assistantships, but was denied. Meiklejohn began to work on adult education in the University of Wisconsin Extension Division in July 1932, where some of the Experimental College's ideas took hold. He later moved to Berkeley. Advisers who stayed after the program's end—such as classicist Walter Agard, philosopher Carl Bögholt, and political scientist John Gaus—were known as popular and innovative, and Agard became the Classics department chair.|$|E
5|$|The {{stone in}} the Capitoline Temple was {{believed}} to have been among the altars located on the Capitoline Hill before the Temple was built under Tarquinius Priscus (traditional reign 616579 BC) or Tarquinius Superbus (535510 BC). When the augurs took the auspices to discover whether the god or goddess of each altar was content for it to be moved, Terminus refused permission, either alone or along with Juventas the goddess of youth. The stone was therefore included within the Capitoline Temple, and its immovability was regarded as a good omen for the <b>permanence</b> of the city's boundaries.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the epic}} poem Mahabharata, Krishna becomes Arjuna's charioteer for the Kurukshetra War, {{but on the}} {{condition}} that he personally will not raise any weapon. Upon arrival at the battlefield, and seeing that the enemies are his family, his grandfather, and his cousins and loved ones, Arjuna is moved and says his heart will not allow him to fight and kill others. He would rather renounce the kingdom and put down his Gandiv (Arjuna's bow). Krishna then advises him about the nature of life, ethics, and morality when one is faced with a war between good and evil, the impermanence of matter, the <b>permanence</b> of the soul and the good, duties and responsibilities, the nature of true peace and bliss and the different types of yoga to reach this state of bliss and inner liberation. This conversation between Krishna and Arjuna is presented as a discourse called the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E

25|$|<b>Permanence</b> in links is {{desirable}} when content items {{are likely to}} be linked to, from, or cited by a source outside the originating organization. Before the advent of large-scale dynamic websites built on database-backed content management systems, it was more common for URLs of specific pieces of content to be static and human readable, as URL structure and naming were dictated by the entity creating that content. Increased volume of content and difficulty of management led to the rise of database-driven systems, and the resulting unwieldy and often-changing URLs necessitated deliberate policies with regard to URL design and link <b>permanence.</b>|$|E

25|$|Islamic texts {{refer to}} several levels of Heaven: Firdaus or Paradise, 'Adn (Eden), Jannatun-Na'iim (heaven of delight), Ma'wa (refuge), Darussalaam (home of peace), Daarul-Muqaamah (home of <b>permanence),</b> Al-Muqqamul Amin (the secure place) & Jannattul-Khuld (heaven of immortality).|$|E
25|$|For {{industrial}} applications, {{as well as}} in the arts, <b>permanence</b> {{and stability}} are desirable properties. Pigments that are not permanent are called fugitive. Fugitive pigments fade over time, or with exposure to light, while some eventually blacken.|$|E
25|$|Turco-Persian {{tradition}} was {{a variant of}} Islamic culture. It was Islamic in that Islamic notions of virtue, <b>permanence,</b> and excellence infused discourse about public issues {{as well as the}} religious affairs of the Muslims, who were the presiding elite.|$|E
25|$|In J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, {{the protagonist}} Holden Caulfield {{at one point}} finds himself heading towards the museum, {{reflecting}} on past visits and remarking that what he likes is the <b>permanence</b> of the exhibits there.|$|E
25|$|Man is a soul, not an institution; {{his inner}} reforms alone can lend <b>permanence</b> to outer ones. By stress on spiritual values, self-realization, a colony exemplifying world brotherhood is {{empowered}} to send inspiring vibrations far beyond its locale.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 5th century, the Roman Empire {{could no longer}} defend itself against either {{internal}} rebellion or the external threat posed by expanding Germanic tribes in Northern Europe.

25|$|George C. Williams in his {{influential}} book Adaptation and Natural Selection {{was one of}} {{the first}} to present a gene-centered view of evolution with the gene as the unit of selection, arguing that a unit of selection should exhibit a high degree of <b>permanence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since 1954, it {{has been}} known that DNA is the main {{physical}} substrate to genetic information, and {{it is capable of}} high-fidelity replication through many generations. So, a particular sequence of DNA can have a high <b>permanence</b> and a low rate of endogenous change.|$|E
25|$|As Piaget {{believed}} {{development was}} a universal process, his initial sample sizes were inadequate, {{particularly in the}} formulation of his theory of infant development. Piaget’s theories of infant development were based on his observations of his own three children. While this clearly presents problems with the sample size, Piaget also probably introduced confounding variables and social desirability into his observations and his conclusions based on his observations. It is entirely possible Piaget conditioned his children to respond in a desirable manner, so, rather than having an understanding of object <b>permanence,</b> his children might have learned to behave in a manner that indicated they understood object <b>permanence.</b> The sample was also very homogenous, as all three children had a similar genetic heritage and environment. Piaget did, however, have larger sample sizes during his later years.|$|E
25|$|Bhava-taṇhā (craving for being): craving to be something, {{to unite}} with an experience. This is ego-related, states Harvey, the seeking of certain {{identity}} and desire for {{certain type of}} rebirth eternally. Other scholars explain {{that this type of}} craving is driven by the wrong view of eternalism (eternal life) and about <b>permanence.</b>|$|E
25|$|After al-Mu'tasim's death, his {{successor}} al-Wathiq (r. 842–847) remained in Samarra. His {{decision to stay}} convinced {{the residents of the}} new city's <b>permanence,</b> and a fresh round of construction began during his reign. Al-Wathiq himself built a new palace, the Haruni (al-Wathiq's given name was Harun) {{on the bank of the}} Tigris, which became his new residence.|$|E
25|$|From {{eight months}} to twelve months old. During this stage {{they can do}} things intentionally. They can now combine and {{recombine}} schemata and try to reach a goal (ex.: use a stick to reach something). They also understand object <b>permanence</b> during this stage. That is, they understand that objects continue to exist even when they can't see them.|$|E
25|$|This {{ideas about}} change and <b>permanence,</b> or {{becoming}} and Being, was {{the influence that}} led Plato to formulate his theory of forms. According to it, there {{is a world of}} perfect, eternal and changeless forms, the realm of Being, and an imperfect sensible world of becoming that partakes the qualities of the forms, and is its instantiation in the sensible world.|$|E
25|$|Pudgala or Matter - Matter is solid, liquid, gas, energy, fine karmic {{materials}} and extra-fine matter or ultimate particles. Paramānu or ultimate particles {{are the basic}} building block of matter. One quality of paramānu and pudgala is <b>permanence</b> and indestructibility. It combines and changes its modes but its qualities remain the same. According to Jainism, it cannot be created nor destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Romans {{used one}} of them, {{possibly}} conichalcite, as a green pigment. The Paris green paint used by the Impressionists {{is said to have}} been composed of relatively coarse particles. Later, the chemical was produced with increasingly small grinds and without carefully removing impurities; its <b>permanence</b> suffered. It is likely that it was ground more finely for use in watercolors and inks, too.|$|E
25|$|Developmental {{theories}} are sometimes presented not as shifts between qualitatively different stages, but as gradual increments on separate dimensions. Development of epistemological beliefs (beliefs about knowledge) {{have been described}} in terms of gradual changes in people's belief in: certainty and <b>permanence</b> of knowledge, fixedness of ability, and credibility of authorities such as teachers and experts. People develop more sophisticated beliefs about knowledge as they gain in education and maturity.|$|E
