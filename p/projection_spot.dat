40|$|International audienceRobust image {{analysis}} of spots in microarrays (quality control + spot segmentation + quantification) {{is a requirement}} for automated software which is of fundamental importance for a high-throughput analysis of genomics microarray-based data. This paper deals {{with the development of}} model-based image processing algorithms for qualifying/segmenting/quantifying adaptively each spot according to its morphology. A series of morphologicalmodels for spot intensities are introduced. The spot typologies representmost of the possible qualitative cases identified from a large database (different routines, techniques, etc.). Then, based on these spot models, a classification framework has been developed. The spot feature extraction and classification (without segmenting) is based on converting the spot image to polar coordinates and, after computing the radial/angular projections, the calculation of granulometric curves and derived parameters from these <b>projections.</b> <b>Spot</b> contour segmentation can also be solved by working in polar coordinates, calculating the up/downminimal path, which is easily obtained with the generalized distance function. With this model-based technique, the segmentation can be regularised by controlling different elements of the algorithm. According to the spot typology (e. g., doughnut-like or egg-like spots), several minimal paths can be computed to obtain a multi-region segmentation. Moreover, this segmentation is more robust and sensible to weak spots, improving the previous approaches...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—DNA {{microarray}} {{technology is}} widely used by geneticists to diagnose or treat diseases through gene expression. This technology {{is based on the}} hybridization of a tissue’s DNA sequence into a substrate and the further analysis of the image formed by the thousands of genes in the DNA as green, red or yellow spots. The process of DNA microarray image analysis involves finding the location of the spots and the quantification of the expression level of these. In this paper, a tool to perform DNA microarray image analysis is presented, including a spot addressing method based on the image <b>projections,</b> the <b>spot</b> segmentation through contour based segmentation and the extraction of relevant information due to gene expression.

40|$|Minimum {{variance}} hedged portfolios using futures {{are formed}} {{by taking the}} linear <b>projection</b> of <b>spot</b> price changes onto futures price movements as the hedge ratio. This unwittingly assumes that the underlying spot-futures price movements follow a cointegrated process, given that the spot and the futures prices are integrated processes. If the spot-futures prices are not cointegrated, the hedged portfolio suffers from the risk of potentially large changes in its value. Empirical findings using the Nikkei stock index and the Nikkei 225 futures show this deviation in intraday trading prices. The basis movements which have often been used by intraday traders to predict future price changes, are tested to be mostly unit root processes. This is shown to be due largely to non-cointegration of the spot-futures prices, and suggests why it is profitable to trade futures using basis knowledge only if trading is done on a continual basis...|$|R

The working principle of this device employs the multiple laser beam triangulation method to determine object position {{in addition to}} its ability to recognize them. The multiwavelength sensor employs five different identically polarized and overlapped laser light beams that are sequentially pulsed and launched through a custom-made curved optical cavity to generate multiple laser spots for each laser. The intensities of the reflected light beams from the different spots are detected by a high-speed area scan image sensor. The discrimination between five different objects, namely, brick, cement sheet, roof tile, cotton, and leather is accomplished by calculating the slopes of the objects’ reflectance spectra at the employed wavelengths. The object position (coordinates) are determined using the triangulation method, which is based on the <b>projection</b> of laser <b>spots</b> along determined angles on the objects and the measurements of the objects’ reflectance spectra using an image sensor.

40|$|Currently, most sensor {{placement}} methodologies {{are focused}} on maximizing the control-lability and observability of the monitored structure. Recently {{there have been several}} sensor placement techniques proposed for damage detection. The work herein provides an integrated sensor placement and reduced order health assessment approach that can be applied to both linear and nonlinear structures. The method uses the idea that often the damageable regions (hot spots) of the system are known in advance and therefore the modes that are sensitive to changes in these hot spots should be the ones exploited for damage detection. Generally,the sensors are placed near the hot spots. However if that is not possible, or if additional sensors are being used, then a generalized eective independence distribution vector method is ap-plied for the remaining sensors. The partial eigenvector information is expanded to the full space using the knowledge that damage is limited to the hot spots of the system. Modal based damage detection methods such as minimum rank perturbation theory (MRPT) can then be used to solve for the damage in a linear system. Also, an alternative damage identication by hot <b>spot</b> <b>projection</b> (DIHSP) method is a novel additional option for the damage detection presented herein.

We have examined the effect of photospheric star spots on multicolour microlensing lightcurves and investigated the detectability of such spots in different wavebands {{as a function of}} spot temperature, position, radius and lens trajectories. We include the effect of limb darkening and <b>spot</b> <b>projection</b> as a function of position on the stellar disc. In particular we apply the updated, state-of-the-art NEXTGEN stellar atmosphere models of Hauschildt et al which predict very strong limb darkening and which are likely to be applicable to the source stars considered here. Our results indicate that star spots generally give a clear signature for transit events. Moreover, this signature is strongly suppressed by limb darkening for spots close to the limb, although the spots may still be clearly detected for favourable lens trajectories. It is also clear that intensive temporal sampling throughout the duration of the transit is necessary in order for such events to be effective as a tool for imaging stellar photospheres. Nonetheless, with sufficiently well sampled light curves of good photometric precision, microlensing can indeed place useful constraints on the presence or otherwise of photospheric starspots.

50|$|Dark Adaptation Threshold (DAT) is {{a vision}} test that {{measures}} the adjustment {{of the eye}} occurring under low levels of illumination. When light enters the eye, it ultimately reaches the rods and cones, which {{are two types of}} cells in the retina. Rods handle vision in low light conditions and cones handle color vision and detail. The rods and cones each react differently during the DAT test, and are measured on a graph. The test determines the threshold, or minimum light intensity required to produce a visual sensation in the child's eye. In order to perform this test, the child is asked to sit in the dark for a half-hour. This allows the eyes to be most sensitive for the test. Once the eyes have fully adapted, the child stands in front of a black <b>projection</b> screen. Dim <b>spots</b> of light are projected onto the screen, one at a time, on either the right or the left side. The spots get dimmer as the test goes on. The child is asked to point to the spots until he or she can no longer distinguish them. In order to keep the child's attention on the screen, sometimes the doctor will wave a brighter light on the screen to hold the child's interest when the test becomes harder to see. When an infant is being tested, an observer with a night vision camera records the head and eye movements of the child as they look at the spots. Once the patient can no longer see the spots, the dark adapted threshold is determined. The DAT test lasts for about 10 to 15 minutes.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{substantial}} research {{efforts have been}} dedicated towards the development of advanced laser scanning systems for discrimination in perimeter security, defence, agriculture, transportation, surveying and geosciences. Military forces, in particular, have already started employing laser scanning technologies for projectile guidance, surveillance, satellite and missile tracking; and target discrimination and recognition. However, laser scanning is relatively a new security technology. It has previously been utilized {{for a wide variety}} of civil and military applications. Terrestrial laser scanning has found new use as an active optical sensor for indoors and outdoors perimeter security. A laser scanning technique with moving parts was tested in the British Home Office - Police Scientific Development Branch (PSDB) in 2004. It was found that laser scanning has the capability to detect humans in 30 m range and vehicles in 80 m range with low false alarm rates. However, laser scanning with moving parts is much more sensitive to vibrations than a multi-beam stationary optic approach. Mirror device scanners are slow, bulky and expensive and being inherently mechanical they wear out as a result of acceleration, cause deflection errors and require regular calibration. Multi-wavelength laser scanning represent a potential evolution from object detection to object identification and classification, where detailed features of objects and materials are discriminated by measuring their reflectance characteristics at specific wavelengths and matching them with their spectral reflectance curves. With the recent advances in the development of high-speed sensors and high-speed data processors, the implementation of multi-wavelength laser scanners for object identification has now become feasible. A two-wavelength photonic-based sensor for object discrimination has recently been reported, based on the use of an optical cavity for generating a laser spot array and maintaining adequate overlapping between tapped collimated laser beams of different wavelengths over a long optical path. While this approach is capable of discriminating between objects of different colours, its main drawback is the limited number of security-related objects that can be discriminated. This thesis proposes and demonstrates the concept of a novel photonic based multi-wavelength sensor for object identification and position finding. The sensor employs a laser combination module for input wavelength signal multiplexing and beam overlapping, a custom-made curved optical cavity for multi-beam spot generation through internal beam reflection and transmission and a high-speed imager for scattered reflectance spectral measurements. Experimental results show that five different laser wavelengths, namely 473 nm, 532 nm, 635 nm, 670 nm and 785 nm, are necessary for discriminating various intruding objects of interest through spectral reflectance and slope measurements. Various objects were selected to demonstrate the proof of concept. We also demonstrate that the object position (coordinates) is determined using the triangulation method, which is based on the <b>projection</b> of laser <b>spots</b> along determined angles onto intruding objects and the measurement of their reflectance spectra using an image sensor. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of the multi-wavelength spectral reflectance sensor to simultaneously discriminate between different objects and predict their positions over a 6 m range with an accuracy exceeding 92 %. A novel optical design is used to provide additional transverse laser beam scanning for the identification of camouflage materials. A camouflage material is chosen to illustrate the discrimination capability of the sensor, which has complex patterns within a single sample, and is successfully detected and discriminated from other objects over a 6 m range by scanning the laser beam spots along the transverse direction. By using more wavelengths at optimised points in the spectrum where different objects show different optical characteristics, better discrimination can be accomplished...|$|R
40|$|Statement of the problem: Currently, {{there are}} no studies that {{presented}} patient centered outcomes for a CAD/CAM 2 -visit digital denture. Purpose: To study: 1) if a 2 -visit CAD/CAM denture was satisfactory to patients who evaluated 12 specific clinical outcomes. 2) If there are any patient reported differences between various clinical outcomes, when evaluated at baseline (within 1 month of insertion) and at a 12 month follow-up since insertion. 3) If there are any adverse clinical and patient-satisfaction outcomes related to CAD-CAM complete denture prostheses. Materials and methods: A total of 20 subjects who presented with an existing set of maxillary and mandibular complete dentures were selected {{to take part in}} the study. Each set of complete dentures were duplicated in a clear acrylic resin. These duplicate dentures were then used as the custom tray, in which the patients went through border molding movements followed by a final impression. Jaw Relation Records was taken in centric relation at the appropriate occlusal vertical dimension and the correct incisal edge position. The mold and shade of the teeth were then selected. The duplicated dentures with occlusal rims and impression were then shipped to AvaDent. A digital preview was reviewed. If corrections were required, it was communicated with AvaDent through email or phone calls. Upon approval of the digital preview, the CAD-CAM monolithic dentures were milled. Standard denture protocols were followed for the insertion visit and subsequent post-insertion visits. The patients evaluated 12 clinical variables using the Visual Analogue Scale at 0 -months (baseline) and at 12 -months following insertion. The following variables were used: Retention (“Tightness”), Stability (“Absence of rockiness”), Support/Absence of food underneath the denture, Esthetics/Cosmetics, Finish/Appearance, Occlusion/Bite and chewing ability, Speech sounds/Ability to speak normally, Extensions/Bulkiness, Tissue health/Absence of discomfort or sore <b>spots,</b> <b>Projection</b> of the upper lip, Treatment time, and Overall evaluation/ “Overall prosthesis satisfaction” The collected data were then statistically analyzed. Results: Of the 20 subjects, 14 patients were evaluated at the 12 month follow up. Three subjects self-withdrew due to patient dissatisfaction. Another 3 patients were lost to follow up. All 14 patients rated the studied clinical outcomes as good to excellent at baseline and at 1 -year recall. Improvements in ratings were seen from baseline to 12 months in the following outcomes: extensions/bulkiness, occlusion/bite or chewing ability, Tissue health/Absence of discomfort or sore spots, finish/appearance, speech sounds, treatment time, and overall evaluation. Conclusions: Within the limitations of this study, the patient-centered outcomes for CAD-CAM dentures fabricated using a 2 -visit protocol in patients with existing complete dentures was evaluated as good to excellent by patients, using a visual analog scale. The patient evaluations showed minimal differences from baseline and at 1 -year evaluation. However, speech, absence of sore spots, and total treatment time showed a statistically significant improvement in VAS ratings. Finally, patients classified as philosophical by House Classification provided the most favorable ratings in patient satisfaction for CAD-CAM dentures. Though the 2 -visit complete denture is a viable treatment option, clinicians should recognize the need for careful patient selection, learning curve in the clinical steps as well as the laboratory aspect of designing the CAD-CAM denture. Furthermore, the additional time and effort, spent off-chairside by clinicians to analyze and approve digital previews, should be weighed against chair-side time spent on the esthetic try-in procedure, which requires an additional visit...|$|R
