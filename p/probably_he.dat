5|$|Ealdred had {{returned}} to England by 1055, and brought with him {{a copy of the}} Pontificale Romano-Germanicum, a set of liturgies, with him. An extant copy of this work, currently manuscript Cotton Vitellus E xii, has been identified as a copy owned by Ealdred. It appears likely that the Rule of Chrodegang, a continental set of ordinances for the communal life of secular canons, was introduced into England by Ealdred sometime before 1059. <b>Probably</b> <b>he</b> brought it back from Germany, possibly in concert with Harold.|$|E
5|$|The exact date of Gubazes's {{accession}} is unknown, but it {{must not}} have been much earlier than 541, when he is first attested as king of the Lazi. It is very likely that before his accession he had lived for several years at the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, for he is recorded {{to have been a}} silentiarius, an influential position at the imperial palace; alternatively, but less <b>probably,</b> <b>he</b> may have been given the title as an honorary appointment after his accession.|$|E
25|$|The last {{information}} about Skaryna is mentioned {{only in the}} archives of 1534. He moved from Vilnius to Prague. <b>Probably</b> <b>he</b> served in the royal garden in Prague until his death. According to some theories, Skaryna taught as {{a professor at the}} Charles University in Prague. It is possible however it is not a fact. Presumably he died in 1551 or 1552.|$|E

25|$|Artashumara {{followed}} his father Shuttarna II on the throne, but {{was murdered by}} a certain UD-hi, or Uthi. It is uncertain what intrigues that followed, but UD-hi then placed Tushratta, another son of Shuttarna, on the throne. <b>Probably,</b> <b>he</b> was quite young {{at the time and}} was intended to serve as a figurehead only. However, he managed to dispose of the murderer, possibly {{with the help of his}} Egyptian father-in-law, but this is sheer speculation.|$|E
25|$|Polyaenus {{says that}} Xerxes praised her gallantry. He {{also in the}} eighth book of his work Stratagems, {{mentions}} that when Artemisia (he may have referred to Artemisia I, but most <b>probably</b> <b>he</b> referred to Artemisia II) wanted to conquer Latmus, she placed soldiers in ambush near the city and she, with women, eunuchs and musicians, celebrated a sacrifice at the grove of the Mother of the Gods, which was about seven stades distant from the city. When the inhabitants of Latmus came out to see the magnificent procession, the soldiers entered the city and took possession of it.|$|E
25|$|The Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple, {{located in}} Melkote built on rocky hills is a square {{building}} of large dimensions but very plain, dedicated to Lord Cheluva-Narayana Swamy or Tirunarayana. Mysore Archaeological Department states, {{on the strength}} of epigraphic evidence, that the presiding deity of this temple was already a well known idol of worship before Sri Ramanujacharya, the Srivaishnava saint worshipped at the shrine in December 1098 and even before he came to the Mysore region and that very <b>probably</b> <b>he</b> used his influence to rebuild or renovate the temple. The temple is richly endowed, having been under the special patronage of the Mysore Wodeyars, and has a most valuable collection of jewels.|$|E

25|$|Peychinovich {{was born}} in the large Polog village of Tearce (Теарце) in present-day Republic of Macedonia (then part of the Ottoman Empire). His secular name is unknown. According to his tombstone, he {{received}} his primary education in the village of Lešok (Лешок). <b>Probably</b> <b>he</b> later studied at the Monastery of St. John Bigorski near Debar. Kiril's father, Peychin, sold his property in Tearce and, together with his brother and his son, moved to the monastery of Hilandar in Mount Athos where the three became monks. Peychin accepted the name Pimen, his brother— Dalmant, and his son— Kiril (Cyril). Later Kiril returned to Tetovo from there set out for the Kičevo Monastery of the Holy Immaculate Theotokos, where he became a hieromonk.|$|E
25|$|The carving {{seems to}} have been {{completed}} by December 1658, for Symon White (who is evidently a superior workman, receiving 22d. a day, the highest wage paid to anyone, and who was the master carver) is no longer employed. No other carvers are mentioned, and as there is not a great deal of ornament, he may have done all the work himself, with the aid perhaps of his apprentices. Very <b>probably</b> <b>he</b> designed it also, and was, no doubt, trained in the new school of classic design, after the manner of Nicholas Stone, {{or any of the other}} carvers of that date, whose work could then be seen on St. Mary's Church porch, or elsewhere. Whether for temperance' sake or for other reasons bevers are now abated, and after this date John Jackson is not paid as overseer.|$|E
25|$|The {{quest for}} relics {{seems to have}} played an {{important}} part in the abbey's effort to maintain itself {{in the face of such}} competition. Abbot Adam, Robert's successor, is known to have visited Canterbury, probably with this aim, and it was <b>probably</b> <b>he</b> who brought back an entire rochet that had belonged to Becket, part of another which was stained with the blood of his martyrdom, another cloth stained with his blood and brains, and various items of his clothing, including his hair shirt, collar, girdle, cowl, shirt and glove. A document prepared in the reign of Henry II lists these relics along with those of many other saints. Second only to the relics of Winifred were those of St Elerius, St Winifred's spiritual director, then wrongly considered the author of a life of Winifred that is now thought to date from about 1100.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{uncertain}} when the castle was built, {{although it was}} probably in the late 11thcentury. In {{the aftermath of the}} Norman Conquest, the manor of Portchester was granted to William Maudit, an associate of William the Conqueror and a powerful magnate, and it was <b>probably</b> <b>he</b> who built Portchester Castle.|$|E
2500|$|The theologian Joseph Barber Lightfoot (Apostolic Fathers, 1885, II, p.84) {{noted on}} this passage: [...] "Clement may {{possibly}} be referring to some known, but hardly accessible land, lying without {{the pillars of}} Hercules.

2500|$|The {{manuscript}} {{once belonged}} to Thomas Howard (1585–1646), 2nd earl of Arundel, 4th earl of Surrey, and 1st earl of Norfolk, art collector and politician; <b>probably</b> <b>he</b> acquired the manuscript by his agents Petty or Thomas Roe in 1626. Then it belonged to Henry Howard (1628–1684), 6th duke of Norfolk, who presented the manuscript to the [...] "Royal Society" [...] in London in 1667 (along with Minuscule 476 and Lectionary 187). It was later purchased by the British Museum from the Royal Society along with more than 500 other Arundel manuscripts in 1831. Since 1973 it is housed in the British Library.|$|E
2500|$|Strategically, and tactically, Charles {{probably}} {{made the best}} decision he could in waiting until his enemies least expected him to intervene, and then marching by stealth to catch them by surprise at a battlefield of his choosing. <b>Probably</b> <b>he</b> and his own men did not realize {{the seriousness of the}} battle they had fought, as Matthew Bennett and his co-authors, in Fighting Techniques of the Medieval World (2005) says: [...] "few battles are remembered 1,000 years after they are fought [...] but the Battle of Tours is an exception [...] Charles Martel turned back a Muslim raid that had it been allowed to continue, might have conquered Gaul." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mieszko died on 25 May 992. Sources give no {{reasons to}} believe that his death {{occurred}} from causes other than natural. According to Thietmar the Polish ruler died in an old age, overcame with fever. <b>Probably</b> <b>he</b> {{was buried in the}} Poznań Cathedral. The remains of the first historical ruler of Poland have never been found and the place of his burial is not known with certainty. In 1836–1837 a cenotaph was built for Mieszko I and his successor Bolesław I the Brave in the Golden Chapel (...) at the Poznań Cathedral, where the damaged remains found in the 14th century tomb of Bolesław were placed.|$|E
2500|$|Although Charles Hitchen was married, he was {{an active}} homosexual. His hefty figure [...] "with a long peruke and sword" [...] was not an {{unfamiliar}} sight in Moorfields, strolling down the [...] "sodomite walk". In early 1727, he took one Richard Williamson to the Talbot Inn on the Strand, where he frequently took soldiers from Savoy barracks. Williamson told his relative about the intercourse, and the two returned to the same tavern a week later to catch Hitchen with some other person. They got the cook of the tavern to fetch a watchman and had the marshal arrested. It is considered unlikely that Williamson and his relative spied on Hitchen on their own, as the regular constabulary was firmly under Hitchen's control. Most <b>probably,</b> <b>he</b> had long become an object of disgust for Reforming constables from the same Society, hence their readiness or involvement in Hitchen's prosecution.|$|E
2500|$|Within the {{premises}} of the Dhakeswari there are temples of two types of architecture. The ancient one is of the Poncharotna Goddess Durga's which lost its actual look after the renovation work. Bradly Bird wrote this {{at the beginning of}} this century. The present temple is two hundred years old which was built by an agent of East India Company. Most <b>probably</b> <b>he</b> had renovated the temple. Other than this there are four Shib Temples. According to hearsay, in the 16th century King Mansing built these temples by laying four Shib Lingas there. But this information seems to be unreliable. The fusion of Bangla chowchala and shikor temple is notice in the architecture of Dhakeshawri. Ratan Lal Chakraborti in an article mentioned that [...] " [...] the structure and architecture of it is like a Buddhist Pagoda". From this he assumed that the temple was probably built in the 10th century.|$|E
