40|$|Driven by {{the ever}} {{increasing}} {{need for the}} high-speed high-accuracy machining of freeform surfaces, the interpolators for <b>parametric</b> <b>curves</b> become highly desirable, as they can eliminate the feedrate and acceleration fluctuation due to the discontinuity in the first derivatives along the linear tool path. The interpolation for <b>parametric</b> <b>curves</b> is essentially an optimization problem, and {{it is extremely difficult}} to get the time-optimal solution. This paper presents a novel real-time interpolator for <b>parametric</b> <b>curves</b> (RTIPC), which provides a near time-optimal solution. It limits the machine dynamics (axial velocities, axial accelerations and jerk) and contour error through feedrate lookahead and acceleration lookahead operations, meanwhile, the feedrate is maintained as high as possible with minimum fluctuation. The lookahead length is dynamically adjusted to minimize the computation load. And the numerical integration error is considered during the lookahead calculation. Two typical <b>parametric</b> <b>curves</b> are selected for both numerical simulation and experimental validation, a cubic phase plate freeform surface is also machined. The numerical simulation is performed using the software (open access information is in the Acknowledgment section) that implements the proposed RTIPC, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the RTIPC. The real-time performance of the RTIPC is tested on the in-house developed controller, which shows satisfactory efficiency. Finally, machining trials are carried out in comparison with the industrial standard linear interpolator and the state-of-the-art Position-Velocity-Time (PVT) interpolator, the results show the significant advantages of the RTIPC in coding, productivity and motion smoothness...|$|R
40|$|<b>Parametric</b> <b>curves</b> and {{surfaces}} are powerful and popular modelling tools in Computer Graphics and Computer Aided Design. Ray-tracing is a versatile and popular rendering technique. There istherefore astrong incentive in developing fast, accurate and reliable algorithms to intersect rays and <b>parametric</b> <b>curves</b> and surfaces. We propose and demonstrate {{the use of}} Chebyshev basis functions {{to speed up the}} computation of the intersections between rays and <b>parametric</b> <b>curves</b> or surfaces. The properties of Chebyshev polynomials result in the computation of better and tighter enclosing boxes. For surfaces they provide a better termination criterion to decide on the limits of subdivision, and allow the use of bilinear surfaces for the computation of the intersection when needed. The efficiency of the techniques used depends on the relative magnitude of the coefficients of the Chebyshev basis functions. We show from a statistical analysis of the characteristics of several thousands surfaces of different origin that these techniques will result most of the time in significant improvement in speed and accuracy over other other boxing and subdivision techniques...|$|R
