500|$|The Act first {{identifies}} the occupier. Section 1(2) {{identifies the}} occupier {{as the person}} occupying or {{in control of the}} premises, not necessarily the owner, with the underlying premise being that the <b>person</b> <b>liable</b> should be the person most likely {{to have been able to}} prevent the harm; the person occupying the premises, not necessarily the owner of those premises. The Act does not define occupier, but provides that the person to be treated as the occupier is the person who would be considered an occupier under common law rules. In Wheat v E Lacon & Co Ltd [...] 1 All ER 582 it was established that more than one person can be an occupier. In Harris v Birkenhead Corporation [...] it was held that it was possible to be an occupier without having physical possession of the house if the [...] "occupier" [...] has legal control of the property. Section 1(3) extends the standards set by the Act not only to land but to any fixed or movable structure, which includes ships and aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|The magister militum in the Diocese of Africa {{declared}} for the East {{and stopped}} the supply of grain to Rome. Italy had not fed itself for centuries and could not do so now. In 398, Stilicho sent his last reserves, a few thousand men, to re-take the Diocese of Africa, and he strengthened his position further when he married his daughter Maria to Honorius. Throughout this period Stilicho, and all other generals, were desperately short of recruits and supplies for them. In 400, Stilicho was charged to press into service any [...] "laetus, Alamannus, Sarmatian, vagrant, son of a veteran" [...] or any other <b>person</b> <b>liable</b> to serve. He had reached {{the bottom of his}} recruitment pool. Though personally not corrupt, he was very active in confiscating assets; the financial and administrative machine was not producing enough support for the army.|$|E
60|$|Consequently, {{claims of}} all kinds--bills, duns, remonstrances and threats, poured in not only upon the son but also upon the father. The latter, it is true, {{was not in}} his own <b>person</b> <b>liable</b> for one penny of them, nor could he well, on his own score, {{be said to be}} an embarrassed man; but he was not the less uneasy. He had {{determined}} if possible to extricate his son once more, and as a preliminary step had himself already raised a large sum of money which it would much trouble him to pay; and he moreover, as he frequently said to Lord Kilcullen, would not and could not pay another penny for the same purpose, until he saw a tolerably sure prospect of being repaid out of his ward's fortune.|$|E

6000|$|I think I may say without vanity, and the {{statement}} {{will not be}} contradicted by those who sat with me, that I made a good impression upon the House {{from the first day}} I entered its doors. Doubtless its members had expected to find in me a rabid <b>person</b> <b>liable</b> to burst into a foam of violence at the word [...] "vaccination," [...] and were agreeably surprised to find that I was much as other men are, only rather quieter than most of them. I did not attempt to force myself upon the notice of the House, but once or twice during the dinner hour I made a few remarks upon subjects connected with public health which were received without impatience, and, in the interval, I tried to master its forms, and {{to get in touch with}} its temper.|$|E
6000|$|I pride {{myself on}} not {{being one of}} these susceptible: If you study the {{electric}} light with which I supply you in that Bumbledonian public capacity of mine over which you make merry from time to time, {{you will find that}} your house contains a great quantity of highly susceptible copper wire which gorges itself with electricity and gives you no light whatever. But here and there occurs a scrap of intensely insusceptible, intensely resistant material; and that stubborn scrap grapples with the current and will not let it through until it has made itself useful to you as those two vital qualities of literature, light and heat. Now if I am to be no mere copper wire amateur but a luminous author, I must also be a most intensely refractory <b>person,</b> <b>liable</b> to go out and to go wrong at inconvenient moments, and with incendiary possibilities. These are the faults of my qualities; and I assure you that I sometimes dislike myself so much that when some irritable reviewer chances at that moment to pitch into me with zest, I feel unspeakably relieved and obliged. But I never dream of reforming, knowing that I must take myself as I am and get what work I can out of myself. All this you will understand; for there is community of material between us: we are both critics of life as well as of art; and you have perhaps said to yourself when I have passed your windows, [...] "There, {{but for the grace of}} God, go I."

6000|$|Thus Maggie was {{introduced}} {{for the first}} time to the young lady's life, and knew what it was to get up in the morning without any imperative reason for doing one thing more than another. This new sense of leisure and unchecked enjoyment amidst the soft-breathing airs and garden-scents of advancing spring--amidst the new abundance of music, and lingering strolls in the sunshine, and the delicious dreaminess of gliding on the river--could hardly be without some intoxicating effect on her, after her years of privation; and even in the first week Maggie began to be less haunted by her sad memories and anticipations. Life was certainly very pleasant just now; it was becoming very pleasant to dress in the evening, and to feel that she was one of the beautiful things of this spring-time. And there were admiring eyes always awaiting her now; she was no longer an unheeded <b>person,</b> <b>liable</b> to be chid, from whom attention was continually claimed, and on whom no one felt bound to confer any. It was pleasant, too, when Stephen and Lucy were gone out riding, to sit down at the piano alone, and find that the old fitness between her fingers and the keys remained, and revived, like a sympathetic kinship not to be worn out by separation; to get the tunes she had heard the evening before, and repeat them again and again until she had found out a way of producing them so as to make them a more pregnant, passionate language to her. The mere concord of octaves was a delight to Maggie, and she would often take up a book of studies rather than any melody, that she might taste more keenly by abstraction the more primitive sensation of intervals. Not that her enjoyment of music was of the kind that indicates a great specific talent; it was rather that her sensibility to the supreme excitement of music was only one form of that passionate sensibility which belonged to her whole nature, and made her faults and virtues all merge in each other; made her affections sometimes an impatient demand, but also prevented her vanity from taking the form of mere feminine coquetry and device, and gave it the poetry of ambition. But you have known Maggie a long while, and need to be told, not her characteristics, but her history, which is a thing hardly to be predicted even from the completest knowledge of characteristics. For the tragedy of our lives is not created entirely from within. [...] "Character," [...] says Novalis, in one of his questionable aphorisms,--"character is destiny." [...] But not the whole of our destiny. Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, was speculative and irresolute, and we have a great tragedy in consequence. But if his father had lived to a good old age, and his uncle had died an early death, we can conceive Hamlet's having married Ophelia, and got through life with a reputation of sanity, notwithstanding many soliloquies, and some moody sarcasms toward the fair daughter of Polonius, to say nothing of the frankest incivility to his father-in-law.|$|E
