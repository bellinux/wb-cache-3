5|$|The Gila monster {{is found}} in the Southwestern United States and Mexico, a range {{including}} Sonora, Arizona, parts of California, Nevada, Utah, and New Mexico (potentially including Baja California). They inhabit scrubland, succulent desert, and oak woodland, seeking shelter in burrows, thickets, and under rocks in locations with ready access to moisture. In fact, Gila monsters seem to like water and can be observed immersing themselves in <b>puddles</b> <b>of</b> water after a summer rain. They avoid living in open areas such as flats and farmland.|$|E
5|$|The copious {{amounts of}} blood spilled {{in the fight}} scenes came from bags of fake blood {{strapped}} to the performers' bodies. Animal blood gathered from slaughterhouses was poured onto the floor to simulate <b>puddles</b> <b>of</b> human blood. Most of the times trick swords made from fiberglass were used when the scene called for a killing blow. Designed by Allder, these swords could also retract their blades, and several sprayed blood from their tips. Although the swords were intended to be safer alternatives to metal weapons, they could still be dangerous: {{in one of the}} fights, Bergman sparred with an extra who failed to follow the choreography and sliced open her finger.|$|E
25|$|A common subtype of the {{fortification}} agate is the parallel-banded, onyx-fortification or water-level agate. Perfectly straight, parallel bands occur over {{all or part}} of these stones. The straight bands were produced by <b>puddles</b> <b>of</b> quartz-rich solutions that crystallized inside the gas pocket under very low fluid pressure. The parallel nature of the bands also indicates the agate's position inside the lava flow.|$|E

Also {{in the band}} was Brad Stewart formerly of Shinedown who now plays in Fuel. In 2010, following the departure of bassist Doug Ardito, he joined <b>Puddle</b> <b>of</b> Mudd.|$|R

25|$|The {{land where}} the homes were being built {{was not part}} of the {{agreement}} between the school board and Hooker; thus, none of these residents knew the canal's history. There was no monitoring or evaluating of the chemical wastes stored under the ground. Additionally, the clay cover of the canal which was supposed to be impermeable began to crack. The subsequent construction of the LaSalle Expressway restricted groundwater from flowing to the Niagara River. After the exceptionally wet winter and spring of 1962, the elevated expressway turned the breached canal into an overflowing pool. People reported having <b>puddles</b> <b>of</b> oil or colored liquid in yards or basements. There were 410 children in the school in 1978.|$|E
25|$|The four-game homestand {{concluded}} with a Sunday afternoon national TV game against arch-rivals New York Red Bulls. Despite a pre-game shower during warm-ups and with inclement weather approaching, the teams kicked off on time, but the game was stopped just shy of the 8:00 mark, because a powerful storm was about to settle over RFK. After the torrential rains eased somewhat, grounds-crew tried to {{remove some of the}} bigger <b>puddles</b> <b>of</b> water and play resumed after a delay of {{about an hour and a}} quarter. Despite epically sloppy conditions, United was able to create some excellent chances to score, but their finishing was not up to the task. NYRB punished the home team's mistakes when Bradley Wright-Phillips finished off a play that opened up when Franklin whiffed on an attempted clearance due to poor footing. The visitors extended their lead in the second half on a shot by Felipe. As the team had done 2 weeks earlier, a desperate United team was able to rally to gain a home draw. First, Marcelo Sarvas scored on a penalty kick, earned by Lloyd Sam, who was playing against his old team for the first time. The tying goal was scored on a header by Patrick Mullins after Birnbaum headed a long corner kick back into the box. With a mid-week trip to Montreal looming, United were clinging to the final post-season slot, holding a tiebreaker edge over Orlando City SC.|$|E
500|$|A push by the sport's {{organizers}} {{to adopt}} an increasingly professional attitude dominated the post-war period: poor field conditions, previously accepted {{as part of the}} game, resulted in numerous complaints against the CRU following the 1949 and 1950 Grey Cups. Field conditions at Toronto's Varsity Stadium were so poor in 1950 that the game has since gained infamy as the [...] "Mud Bowl". Deep ruts in the field and poor weather {{in the days leading up}} to the game resulted in a sloppy field covered in large <b>puddles</b> <b>of</b> water. The game also gained notoriety for the near drowning of Winnipeg's Buddy Tinsley, who was found face down in a large puddle, apparently unconscious. Tinsley later said that he had not lost consciousness, but his leg had gone numb from a hard hit to a preexisting injury. [...] Toronto won the game 13–0, the last time a team has been shut out in a Grey Cup game.|$|E

500|$|Whereas many {{role-playing}} {{video games}} limit {{the usage of}} their forms of magic to battles as offensive and defensive measures, Psynergy spells are also heavily used in puzzles and exploration. Some types of Psynergy can only be used in combat; conversely, some spells are only used in the game's overworld and in non-battle scenarios. Still other Psynergy {{can be used for}} both situations; for example, the “Frost” spell can be used to damage enemies in battle, or to transform <b>puddles</b> <b>of</b> water into elongated pillars of ice as part of a puzzle. The player gains more and more Psynergy spells as the game progresses, either through levelling up or acquiring and equipping, or using, special items, and with each [...] "utility" [...] Psynergy spell the party gains access to more locations and secrets hidden within the game world. Players will be required to return to previous locations in the game to finish off puzzles which they could not solve earlier {{because of the lack of}} specific Psynergy spells.|$|E

2500|$|Each {{track is}} {{different}} and range from standard ovals to tracks with many twists and turns. The game includes many obstacles, such as oil slicks that send players spinning, <b>puddles</b> <b>of</b> water that cause players to slide out of control, sand traps and [...] "slow cones" [...] that slow players down, large cones that bring players to a complete halt, and walls of tires that players bounce off. If a player hits an oil slick and then hits a wall while spinning, the player's car is temporarily destroyed, which loses time. The tracks also has items that help players along the way: [...] "zippers" [...] (a series of chevrons on the track) give players a speed boost, roll cages allow players to hit walls without being destroyed {{and allow them to}} crash opponents by forcing them into walls, and missiles and bombs temporarily destroy opponents' cars. Also on the track are spare parts which help improve performancetires improve traction, batteries increase acceleration, and engines improve speed.|$|E

60|$|The saloon had an air {{of cheap}} crime and a floor covered with clotted sawdust. The bar was a slab of dark-brown wood, so worn that semicircles of slivers were showing. The nasty gutter was still filled with cigar-ends and <b>puddles</b> <b>of</b> beer and bits of free-lunch cheese.|$|E

60|$|If {{you add to}} {{all that}} that {{he came up to}} the judge's house one night and found a poet reciting verses to Zena, you will {{understand}} the suicide at once. It was one of those regular poets with a solemn jackass face, and lank parted hair and eyes like <b>puddles</b> <b>of</b> molasses. I don't know how he came there--up from the city, probably--but there he was on the Pepperleighs' verandah that August evening. He was reciting poetry--either Tennyson's or Shelley's, or his own, you couldn't tell--and about him sat Zena with her hands clasped and Nora Gallagher looking at the sky and Jocelyn Drone gazing into infinity, and a little tubby woman looking at the poet with her head falling over sideways--in fact, there was a whole group of them.|$|E

The garden had roses in it and several sorts of late summer flowers, as well as ripe cherries, currants, grapes, and a Virginia-creeper red with autumn, all harmoniously contemporaneous, as they might easily be in a climate where no one of the seasons can very well know itself from the others. It had not been raining for half an hour, and the sun was scalding hot, so that the shelter of their roof was very grateful, and the <b>puddles</b> <b>of</b> the paths were drying up with the haste which puddles have to make in Germany, between rains, if they are ever going to dry up at all.|$|E
