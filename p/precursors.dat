In general, the complex molecules that make up cellular structures are constructed step-by-step from small and simple <b>precursors.</b> Anabolism involves three basic stages. First, the production of <b>precursors</b> such as amino acids, monosaccharides, isoprenoids and nucleotides, secondly, their activation into reactive forms using energy from ATP, and thirdly, the assembly of these <b>precursors</b> into complex molecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and nucleic acids.|$|E

40|$|The β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> {{protein is}} the <b>precursor</b> {{of the main}} {{component}} of senile plaques (the β-amyloid peptide or β/A 4) found in the brain of aged humans and, in higher amounts, in the brain of Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome subjects. Four different forms of β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> protein messenger RNAs have been described in humans and rodents: β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> protein 695, β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> protein 714, β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> protein 751 and β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> protein 770 messenger RNAs (numbers corresponding to the number of encoded amino acids). The two latter forms are characterized by containing in their sequence a region with high homology to the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors. We have used oligonucleotide probes to study the distribution of the different messenger RNAs encoding each of the four β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> proteins by in situ hybridization histochemistry in human, rat and mouse brain. We found that β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> protein 695, β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> protein 714 and β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> protein 751 messenger RNAs were widely distributed in the human, rat and mouse brain and that their distribution was roughly similar in most brain areas in these three species. The distribution of β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> protein 770 messenger RNA was not so wide and differed among the three species studied. β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> protein 751 and 770 messenger RNAs were the only forms present at significant levels in rodent choroid plexus and meninges, while β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> protein messenger RNA isoforms containing and lacking the Kunitz domain were detected in the human choroid plexus. We also observed that the relative levels of β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> protein 751 and 770 messenger RNAs in the rat cerebral white matter {{as well as in the}} mouse and human striatum were higher than those of the β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> protein messenger RNAs lacking the Kunitz domain. While the most abundant β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> protein messenger RNAs in the brain of all three species under study were, in descending order, β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> protein 695 and β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> protein 751 messenger RNAs, the least abundant form was not the same for all species: in human it was β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> protein 714 messenger RNA and in rat and mouse brain it was β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> protein 770 messenger RNA. Our results show differences both inter- and intraspecies of the relative abundance and distribution of four β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> protein messenger RNAs in rat, mouse and human brain. The non-coincidence of the distribution of β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> protein messenger RNA isoforms suggests different physiological functions for the β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> proteins. Interspecies differences should be considered when comparing results from animal and human studies.

30|$|If {{the fluid}} is {{perfectly}} wetting, {{we have seen}} that van der Waals forces lead to the formation of a <b>precursor</b> film in front of the contact line (de Gennes 1985). Wang (2003) in his thesis claimed the surface feature, particularly micro-structure or roughness, promotes the formation and development of thin <b>precursor</b> film, they claimed that the <b>precursor</b> film spreads much faster than the movement of the apparent contact line (ACL) on a rough solid surface. Amit Sah (2014) studied <b>precursor</b> film with glass capillaries and cover slips.

Yuan and Zhao (2010) using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the atomic details and the transport properties of the <b>precursor</b> film in dynamic wetting. Their results showed that the molecules which finally formed the <b>precursor</b> film came almost from the surface in the initial state of the droplet. The fast propagation of the <b>precursor</b> film is owing to continuous and very fast diffusing of the surface water molecules that have the highest self-diffusion coefficient {{to the front of the}} <b>precursor</b> film allows for fast propagation of the <b>precursor</b> film. <b>Precursor</b> film propagates fast with low energy dissipation.|$|R

5|$|Terpenes and isoprenoids, {{including}} the carotenoids, {{are made by}} the assembly and modification of isoprene units donated from the reactive <b>precursors</b> isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate.

One important reaction that uses these activated isoprene donors is steroid biosynthesis. Here, the isoprene units are joined together to make squalene and then folded up and formed into a set of rings to make lanosterol. Lanosterol can then be converted into other steroids such as cholesterol and ergosterol.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{potential}} of the common biosynthetic <b>precursor</b> of neurophysin and neuropeptide hormones to self-associate has been assessed by quantitative affinity chromatographic analysis.

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanism}} of import-competent <b>precursor</b> protein-induced inactivation of a 50 -pS anion channel of the chloroplast envelope is investigated using single-channel recordings. The inactivation by <b>precursor</b> protein {{is the result}} of the induction of a long-lived closed state of the channel. The mean duration of this state does not depend on <b>precursor</b> concentration. From this it can be concluded that the protein import related anion channel enters the inactive state less frequently when the <b>precursor</b> concentration is lowered, but that the time spent in this state remains the same. Furthermore, it was found that the presence of <b>precursor</b> protein also decreases the mean durations of preexisting open and closed states of the channel. This decrease is found to be dependent on the <b>precursor</b> concentration. From this it is concluded that there is a direct interaction between the <b>precursor</b> protein and a protein complex of which the channel is a constituent. The mean duration of the precursor-induced long-lived closed state does not depend on the length of the translocation-competent <b>precursor.</b> This suggests that the duration of import is independent of <b>precursor</b> length...|$|R
