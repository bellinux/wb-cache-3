30|$|The {{utilization}} of microbial resources by human has experienced two stages, from naturally mixed <b>culture</b> to <b>pure</b> <b>culture.</b> Human beings have used microbial metabolites for centuries, such as bread, wine, cheese, pickles, and other fermented materials, being provided by fermentation using bacteria and fungi. The bioprocesses {{were carried out}} with naturally mixed culture (Sabra and Zeng 2014), which is microbial fermentation by different specified/unspecified microorganisms. In order to avoid contamination of the fermentation process and the product with pathogenic microbes, mixed culture was gradually replaced by <b>pure</b> <b>culture.</b> Without the complicated situation of coexistence of multiple microbes, microbial <b>pure</b> <b>culture</b> allows researchers to be undisturbed for a single strain, {{and to have a}} deeper understanding about morphological, physiological, biochemical, and genetic characteristics of microorganisms. <b>Pure</b> <b>culture</b> has built up a milestone for biochemical engineering and modern biotechnology. To date, many bulk biotechnological products such as amino acids, organic acids, antibiotics, and enzymes are almost produced by <b>pure</b> <b>cultures</b> of microorganisms (Sabra et al. 2010). However, about 90 – 99.8 % of the microbes in natural environment cannot be cultured with currently available technologies, and hence cannot be exploited further for biotechnology with <b>pure</b> <b>culture</b> (Streit et al. 2004). The typical problems for biofuels and bio-based chemicals production with <b>pure</b> <b>cultures</b> are the high costs of substrates and product purification, high energy demand for fermentation operation, and high concentrations of by-products in the form of organic acids or alcohols which are toxic to cell growth (Xiu and Zeng 2008; Zeng and Sabra 2011).|$|R

The <b>pure</b> <b>culture</b> of S. aciditrophicus produced approximately 0. 5 mol of cyclohexane carboxylate and 1. 5 mol of acetate per mol of benzoate, while a coculture of S. aciditrophicus with the hydrogen-using methanogen Methanospirillum hungatei produced 3 mol of acetate and 0. 75 mol of methane per mol of benzoate. The growth yield of the S. aciditrophicus <b>pure</b> <b>culture</b> was 6. 9 g (dry weight) per mol of benzoate metabolized, whereas the growth yield of the S. aciditrophicus-M. hungatei coculture was 11. 8 g (dry weight) per mol of benzoate. Cyclohexane carboxylate was metabolized by S. aciditrophicus only in a coculture with a hydrogen user and was not metabolized by S. aciditrophicus <b>pure</b> <b>cultures.</b> Cyclohex- 1 -ene carboxylate was incompletely degraded by S. aciditrophicus <b>pure</b> <b>cultures</b> until a free energy change (ΔG′) of − 9. 2 kJ/mol was reached (− 4. 7 kJ/mol for the hydrogen-producing reaction).

However, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) showed that accumulation of Cd in the form of CdS occurred in biofilms exposed to Cd while back-scattered electron imaging of sections indicated that the accumulation of Cd was localized in a superficial layer of the biofilm. The mechanism of uptake, therefore, appeared to be entrapment and/or precipitation of CdS at the biofilm surface. The relatively low Cd uptake by the <b>pure</b> <b>culture</b> biofilm was attributed to its less efficient growth and polysaccharide production.

Northern blot analysis indicated that only the mcr gene, which encodes methyl coenzyme M reductase I (MRI), catalyzing the final step of methanogenesis, was expressed in the coculture, whereas mcr and mrt, which encodes methyl coenzyme M reductase II (MRII), the isofunctional enzyme of MRI, were expressed at the early to late stage {{of growth in the}} <b>pure</b> <b>culture.</b> In contrast to these two genes, two isofunctional genes (mtd and mth) for N 5,N 10 -methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the fourth step of methanogenesis, and two hydrogenase genes (frh and mvh) were expressed both in a <b>pure</b> <b>culture</b> and in a coculture at the early and late stages of growth.
