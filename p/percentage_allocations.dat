40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{document}} and explain the allocation of takeover purchase price to identifiable intangible assets (IIAs), purchased goodwill, and/or target net tangible assets in an accounting environment unconstrained with respect to IIA accounting policy choice. Using a sample of Australian acquisitions during the unconstrained accounting environment from 1988 to 2004, we find the <b>percentage</b> <b>allocation</b> of purchase price to IIAs averaged 19. 09 %. The <b>percentage</b> <b>allocation</b> to IIAs is significantly positively related to return on assets and insignificantly related to leverage, contrary to opportunism. Efficiency suggests an explanation: profitable firms acquire and capitalise a higher percentage of IIAs in acquisitions. The target's investment opportunity set is significantly positively related to the <b>percentage</b> <b>allocation</b> to IIAs, consistent with information-signalling. The paper contributes to the accounting policy choice literature by showing how Australian firms make the one-off accounting policy choice in regards allocation of takeover purchase price (which is often a substantial dollar amount to) in an environment where accounting for IIAs was unconstrained. ...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{is one of}} the main system resources that has to be optimally allocated, due to its impact on the amount of generated interference and the battery life for multimedia communication. In this paper, we concentrate on the time-division duplexing (TDD) option and how to efficiently allocate energy on both uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) channels that share the same bandwidth but over different time intervals. One of the main advantages of TDD is the possibility for load compensation between UL and DL, by allocating a larger percentage of time for the operation in DL if the system is congested in DL, and vice versa. While this allocation can be done on each cell independently, the result is that adjacent cells would have a different compensation value, thus generating cross interference, which decreases the system performance, mainly on the cell-edge users.

The preferred alternative would implement a catch sharing plan for the charter and commercial sectors in these areas to resolve conservation and allocation concerns that have resulted from increased harvests in the charter halibut fishery in both areas, and decreased catch limits in the commercial setline fisheries in Area 2 C. The plan would (1) replace the current guideline harvest levels (GHLs); (2) set initial allocations for each sector; (3) implement management measures to limit charter harvests to the allocations; and (4) allow charter halibut limited entry permit (LEP) holders to lease halibut individual fishing quota from commercial quota share holders, to increase their seasonal allocations for use by their clients. The plan would require pre-season notice of upcoming management measures to allow an uninterrupted charter season. The North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) intends that the allocations to both sectors vary with halibut abundance; hence, its preferred alternative includes a fixed <b>percentage</b> <b>allocation.</b> The initial charter sector allocation would be 17. 3 percent of the Area 2 C combined commercial and charter catch limit when it {{is determined by the}} IPHC to be less than 5 Mlb; the allocation would be 15. 1 percent when the combined catch limit is 5 Mlb or more.

40|$|Following the {{classical}} portfolio theory all an investor {{has to do}} for an optimal investment is to determine his risk attitude. This allows him to find his point on the capital market line by combining a risk-free asset with the market portfolio. We investigate the following research questions in an experimental set-up: Do private investors see a relationship between risk attitude and the amount invested risky at all and do they adjust their investments if provided with different risk levels of the risky asset? To answer these questions we ask subjects in a between subject design to allocate a certain amount between a risky and a risk-free asset. Risky assets differ between conditions, but can be transformed into each other by combining them with the risk-free asset. We find that mainly investors risk attitude, but also their risk perception, and the investment horizon are strong predictors for risk taking. Indeed, investors {{do not appear to}} be naïve, but they do something sensitive. Nevertheless, we observe a strong framing effect: investors choose almost the same allocation to the risky asset independently of changes in its risk-return profile thus ending up with significantly different volatilities. Feedback does not mitigate the framing effect. The effect is somewhat smaller for investors with a high financial literacy. Overall, people seem to use two mental accounts, one for the risk-free and one for the risky investment with the risk attitude determining the <b>percentage</b> <b>allocation</b> to the risky asset and not the chosen portfolio volatility. ...|$|R

40|$|Ever {{since the}} 1990 s, when the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) was {{developed}} {{as the primary}} method for delivering major public-sector capital projects in the UK, it has been severely criticised {{for the lack of}} design quality in the buildings that it produced. The main driver for this thesis was to redress that situation. The development of an Architectural Design Quality Evaluation Tool was based on a live project with a metropolitan council in the North East of England. The aim was to improve the design quality of schemes that had been submitted through a PFI to replace the council’s entire sheltered housing stock. The Tool has two functions. It was a substantial part of the assessment process, which selected the preferred bidding consortium from the original six bidders, through a series of stages. However, it was also directed at improving the quality of all submitted designs through an iterative process. While existing tools provide useful benchmarks, and some offer means of structuring an evaluation, none are totally applicable in the context of PFI competitive bidding processes. Moreover, the existing tools are good for evaluating performance attributes of buildings, and these are important, but do not substantially tackle the less tangible amenity attributes that are vital to engendering the feeling of home. This Tool emphasises the amenity attributes without neglecting performance, thus generating a design quality hierarchy. The criteria for assessment are derived from academic publications. In order to reflect the hierarchy, each criterion was weighted {{on a scale of one}} to five, in accordance with multivariable utility theory. The <b>percentage</b> <b>allocation</b> to each main heading of the Tool was determined by the local authority Project Team. A User Guide was developed to assist the evaluation of schemes. The Tool itself was appraised at the final stage, assisting the selection of the preferred bidder. The designs were evaluated in three reviews, thus providing 156 results. The Tool and its development have been published, and the Tool and the User Guide accepted by the Homes and Communities Agency as an example of good practice. Both currently appear on its website.
