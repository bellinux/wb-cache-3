40|$|Metaphor is a {{critical}} component of being an architect: it mediates the various stages involved in architectural design, motivates {{a large part of the}} jargon used in the discipline, and is consistently used as a rhetorical strategy in many of the genres articulating architectural communication. Given its importance in architectural practice and discourse, the teaching of metaphor should be included in the syllabi of English for Specific Purposes (ESP) courses taught at polytechnic schools. The purpose of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, I describe how various metaphors inform architects ’ practice – from the first design phase to the <b>post-construction</b> <b>assessment</b> distributed in one of the most popular genres in the community; that is, the architectural review. Drawing insights from cognitive and genre research into the role of metaphor in the discipline, I then suggest ways in which metaphorical competence can be fostered in ESP courses aiming at facilitating the students ’ gradual enculturation process into their future community of practice...|$|E
40|$|As {{attentive}} {{as we were}} in {{gathering information}} {{for the design of}} our knowledge/learning/information commons, {{it is important that we}} subsequently assess how these spaces are being used. During the 2008 ARL Library Assessment Conference, 12 easy-to-use techniques were identified to help libraries gather information which could inform design. This program examines how extensively these techniques were used and how successfully they have been applied in post-construction assessments. This workshop will review the results of a survey of approximately 100 libraries with recently completed projects. The survey gathered information on: Which of the 12 techniques, if any, were used in the design phase and/or in <b>post-construction</b> <b>assessment?</b> Which techniques have been easier to implement? *Which techniques yielded useful information for design and for assessment? What barriers, if any, were experienced in these pre- and post-construction data collection efforts? What plans, if any, have been made to disseminate the results of these assessments...|$|E
40|$|Human {{activities}} today often cause landscape habitat {{fragmentation and}} blockage of wildlife movements across landscapes and ecosystems. North American and European Union initiatives {{such as the}} Transportation Equity Act and COST- 341 program have heightened the importance of mitigating {{the negative effects of}} roads, such as animal-vehicle collisions and barrier effects. Wildlife crossing structures are being incorporated into some road construction and improvement projects in an attempt to reduce negative effects on wildlife populations. Transportation and resource agencies are becoming increasingly accountable and therefore concerned as to whether highway mitigation measures are functional and perform to expected standards. However, there are presently gaps in our knowledge regarding the effectiveness of wildlife crossings structure applications. One reason for the lack of available information is that relatively few mitigation projects implement rigid monitoring programs with sufficient experimental design. Thus, results obtained from most studies remain anecdotal or descriptive at best. With sufficient lead-time, experimental study designs can provide rigorous assessments of highway impacts and wildlife crossing structure performance pre- versus post-construction. Alternative methods of <b>post-construction</b> <b>assessment</b> can be used if time does not permit for data collection during the pre-construction period. We review past and current methods used to evaluate wildlife crossing structures and examine criteria to consider when evaluating wildlife passage effectiveness. We focus on methods to monitor mammals and summarize representative studies published international journals and conference proceedings. We examine pre- and post-mitigation study designs versus evaluations that base effectiveness solely on post-mitigation monitoring. We make suggestions for conducting quality scientific evaluations that will allow transportation agencies to address the question, “Do wildlife crossing structures work?...|$|E
40|$|Conventional field {{compaction}} control {{methods are}} effective {{at the time}} of placement. However, the discrete nature of these measurements and a limited depth of investigation can render them unsuitable for <b>post-construction</b> compaction quality <b>assessments</b> of deeper fills or larger surface areas. In this situation, classical destructive geotechnical surveys (i. e. boreholes, cone penetration tests) are sought to evaluate the current fill conditions. Nevertheless, these methods often do not provide the required level of information because only certain locations are tested and they have tremendous implications in terms of cost. The use of available non-destructive methodologies, such as shear wave velocity surveys (i. e. SASW, spectral analysis of surface waves or HVSR, horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio) together with electrical resistivity tomography surveys (e. g. evaluation of water content), offers a valuable alternative to efficiently control compaction over large areas during post-construction stages and locate areas within the existing formations where the soil was not sufficiently compacted. This study explores the performance of a cost effective method for evaluating the characteristics of compacted fills by measuring the shear wave velocity and matric suction to evaluate the void ratio or dry density of compacted soil. Laboratory studies of compacted specimens were used to evaluate this method and their performance under different isotropic confining pressures. The results showed that the shear wave velocity and matric suction can effectively predict how the soil is compacted, but its success requires field measurements of both shear wave velocity and matric suction. The application of this relationship would enable practitioners to efficiently control compaction over large areas during post-construction stages, and locate areas within the existing formations where the soil was not sufficiently compacted...|$|R
40|$|Bird and bat {{fatalities}} {{from wind}} energy projects are an environmental and public concern, with post-construction fatalities sometimes differing from predictions. Siting facilities {{in this context}} can be a challenge. In March 2012 the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) released Land-based Wind Energy Guidelines to assess collision fatalities and other potential impacts to species of concern and their habitats to aid in siting and management. The Guidelines recommend a tiered approach for assessing risk to wildlife, including a preliminary site evaluation that may evaluate alternative sites, a site characterization, field studies to document wildlife and habitat and to predict project impacts, post construction studies to estimate impacts, and other post construction studies. We applied the tiered assessment framework to a case study site, the Mount Storm Wind Energy Facility in Grant County, West Virginia, USA, to demonstrate {{the use of the}} USFWS assessment approach, to indicate how the use of a tiered assessment framework might have altered outputs of wildlife assessments previously undertaken for the case study site, and to assess benefits of a tiered ecological assessment framework for siting wind energy facilities. The conclusions of this tiered assessment for birds {{are similar to those of}} previous environmental assessments for Mount Storm. This assessment found risk to individual migratory tree-roosting bats that was not emphasized in previous preconstruction assessments. Differences compared to previous environmental assessments are more related to knowledge accrued in the past 10 years rather than to the tiered structure of the Guidelines. Benefits of the tiered assessment framework include good communication among stakeholders, clear decision points, a standard assessment trajectory, narrowing the list of species of concern, improving study protocols, promoting consideration of population-level effects, promoting adaptive management through <b>post-construction</b> <b>assessment</b> and mitigation, and sharing information that can be used in other assessments...|$|E
40|$|Progress {{has been}} made in eradicating the backlog in sanitation. This is {{reflected}} by the 2011 Census results that reflect a 21 percent increase in the provision of sanitation between the 2001 Census and the 2011 Census. In the rural areas of O. R. Tambo District Municipality, the eradication of sanitation backlogs is done through the provision of VIPs for sanitation. Even with this progress, there are still challenges resulting from the previously constructed sanitation facilities. Some of the challenges relate to the poor quality of these facilities. Community members – via the IDP road shows have voiced their unhappiness with regard to some of the sustainability factors of these structures. Community members feel they were not involved in decisions related to the sanitation projects. It has also been observed that the municipality and its agents do not conduct environmental management studies; and some pits of these structures were not lined, and the health and hygiene training, together with <b>post-construction</b> <b>assessment</b> was not done. In this study, an assessment of the provision of sanitation facilities, in order to identify some of the key factors that are critical to the sustainability of rural sanitation facilities, was done. The research findings should be helpful in assisting local government to improve the provision of sanitation facilities, with the aim of ensuring sustainability, improving community satisfaction, and improving {{the quality of life for}} the people living in these villages. For the purpose of the study, a quantitative research approach was used. A research questionnaire was used to collect the data; and it was distributed through email to a sample of respondents that understood sanitation issues. The data were collected from municipal officials, consultants working on sanitation projects, as well as other stakeholders with influence and an interest in sanitation. The results were analysed to establish the findings and to propose recommendations, in order to improve the sustainability of rural sanitation facilities. From the research findings, the recommendations highlighted the need for an improved participatory approach in implementing sanitation projects. To ensure sustainability, the following issues are key: monitoring and supervision; community participation and adherence to design guidelines; a review of the sanitation provision policy; as well as the promotion of health and hygien...|$|E
