25|$|Following {{the work}} of Jimi Hendrix in the late 1960s, black funk artists such as Sly and the Family Stone pioneered a style known as {{psychedelic}} funk by borrowing techniques from psychedelic rock music, including wah <b>pedals,</b> fuzz <b>boxes,</b> echo chambers, and vocal distorters, as well as blues rock and jazz. In the following years, groups such as George Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic continued this sensibility, employing synthesizers and rock-oriented guitar work.|$|R

50|$|The W152's {{mechanicals}} {{are from}} a Jaguar XJ from 1968-1986. There are three different engine options in a W152, the Jaguar XK6, AJ6 or V12. Any appropriate gearbox can be used but normally a suitable manual gearbox from a Jaguar is used. The W152 uses the independent rear suspension (IRS) unit and front wishbones from the Jaguar donor car but instead of using the standard springs and shock absorbers, it utilises modern coil over shocks. The steering rack is sourced from an MGB and uses extenders to the track-rod ends to suit the wider track of the car. The car uses the standard Jaguar brake calipers and discs but uses a different, split system <b>pedal</b> <b>box,</b> remote fluid reservoirs and twin servos. Most cars up until about 2011 used a custom built <b>pedal</b> <b>box</b> but they now use an OBP <b>pedal</b> <b>box.</b> The front suspension arms and steering arm and track rod end extensions are usually nickel-plated.|$|E

For an engine, the Porsche 934-derived Type-935 2.8L flat-6 was used with air cooling and a single Kühnle, Kopp und Kausch AG K36 turbocharger instead of the twin K27 turbochargers of the Group C 956, as twin-turbo systems were not allowed in IMSA's GTP class at the time.|$|E

5000|$|Following {{the late}} 1960s work of Jimi Hendrix, psychedelia {{began to have}} a {{widespread}} impact on African American musicians. [...] Black funk artists such as Sly and the Family Stone borrowed techniques from psychedelic rock music, including wah <b>pedals,</b> fuzz <b>boxes,</b> echo chambers, and vocal distorters, as well as elements of blues rock and jazz. In the following years, groups such as Parliament-Funkadelic continued this sensibility, employing synthesizers and rock-oriented guitar work into open-ended funk jams. Producer Norman Whitfield would draw on this sound on popular Motown recordings such as The Temptations' [...] "Cloud Nine" [...] and Marvin Gaye's [...] "I Heard It Through the Grapevine."Subsequent artists would {{be influenced by the}} style including Prince. In the early 1970s, jazz artists such as Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock combined elements of psychedelic funk with urban jazz to pioneer jazz fusion. Influenced by George Clinton, new wave band Talking Heads explored psychedelic funk in collaboration with producer Brian Eno on a trilogy of acclaimed albums in the late 1970s. [...] In recent years, examples of psychedelic funk from world music scenes have been collected on compilations issued on the World Psychedelic Funk Classics label.|$|R
5000|$|Keith Whitham of The Living Tradition, {{comparing}} the album to their previous album A Whisky Kiss, said [...] "in those four years essentially very little has changed. They've unquestionably become more experimental, Solar Shears is a quantum jump in production terms for the group." [...] The album continues the band's self-coined [...] "acid croft" [...] sound, featuring a blend between Scottish Celtic music, various other world styles and contemporary genres such as techno and ambient. Several critics pointed out an Eastern music influence, and another bluegrass, whilst The Chicago Tribune {{called it a}} [...] "trippy blend of tradition, psychedelia and instrumental hip-hop." [...] The band made liberal use of distortion <b>pedals</b> and effects <b>boxes</b> in addition to pillaging DJ techniques, working in all types of looped beats, scratching, electro-atmospherics and sampled 'discovered sounds' from industrial clanks and rumbles to snatches of telephone conversation and recorded pelican crossing announcements.|$|R
5000|$|Citroën's {{advanced}} high-pressure LHM hydraulics {{were adopted}} {{to operate the}} ventilated disc brakes on the main circuit, and on an auxiliary circuit the <b>pedal</b> <b>box</b> brake, foot-throttle, the driver's seat adjustments, and the retractable headlights. Wheels were 7.5 x 15 inch Campagnolo light alloy rims with distinctive removable polished stainless steel hubcaps in the earlier automobiles, and tyres were Michelin XWX 205x70 front and rear, however these early cars exhibited problems with [...] "tramlining" [...] at speed. To solve this problem Maserati fitted later cars with 215x70 Michelins'.|$|E
50|$|Standing 1138 mm high, {{perhaps the}} most {{distinctive}} details were the brushed stainless steel roof and windscreen pillars. Inside, the bucket seats, dash, door trim, centre console and rear bulkhead were trimmed in leather, electric windows having been standard, most cars also getting air conditioners. The steering column was manually adjustable for rake and reach, whereas the LHM aux. circuit controls adjusted the driver's seat vertically, the <b>pedal</b> <b>box</b> of the brake, clutch and throttle pedals horizontally forwards and backwards by around three inches (76 mm)--a first such application {{in the world for}} a production car, and also to raise and lower the concealed headlights in the front fenders.|$|E

50|$|The Series 2 1750 GTV of 1970 {{introduced}} other mechanical changes, {{including a}} dual circuit braking system (split front and rear, with separate servos). The brake and clutch pedals on {{left hand drive}} cars were also of an improved pendant design, instead of the earlier floor-hinged type. On right hand drive cars the floor-hinged pedals were retained, as there was no space for the <b>pedal</b> <b>box</b> behind the carburettors. Externally, the series 2 1750 GTV is identified by new, slimmer bumpers with front and rear overriders. The combined front indicator and sidelight units were now mounted to the front panel instead of the front bumper, except again on the 1971-72 US/Canadian market cars. The interior was slightly modified, with the seats retaining the same basic outline but following a simpler design.|$|E
50|$|In Australia, {{a unique}} {{variant of the}} CJ5/CJ6 was {{produced}} in limited numbers. In 1965, when the CJ was given the all-new Buick V6, Jeep saw the need for something similar in Australia. As such, they began to fit Falcon 6-cylinder engines to them at their Rocklea factory in Queensland. The jeep was fitted with an engine, <b>pedal</b> <b>box</b> and clutch/brake system corresponding to the equivalent Falcon at the time; i.e. a 1965 CJ5 would be fitted with 1965 Falcon engine/clutch components. When the Falcon received a hydraulic clutch system, so too did the Jeep. Combat 6 jeeps were also fitted with Australian Borg Warner differentials, and Borg Warner brand gearboxes. There is very little documentation about these Jeeps, and often {{the only way to}} conclusively identify them is by owner history.|$|E
5000|$|While a {{model may}} be said to use an MLB {{platform}}, {{it is not so much}} a platform per se, but rather a system for introducing rationality across disparate platforms that share engine orientation [...] - [...] regardless of model, vehicle size or brand. Thus, MLB uses a core [...] "matrix" [...] of components across a wide variety of platforms [...] - [...] for example, sharing a common engine-mounting core for all drivetrains (e.g., gasoline, diesel, natural gas, hybrid and purely electric). The only things that are non-variable are the <b>pedal</b> <b>box,</b> firewall, and front wheel placement, as well as the windscreen angle; other than this, the vehicle can be stretched and shaped to fit any body style, size range, or drivetrain required.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is the design and {{implementation}} of the <b>pedal</b> <b>box</b> for the 2007 MIT Formula SAE car. Formula SAE is a collegiate competition in which groups of degree seeking students design and manufacture small formula style race cars to compete on design, cost, marketing, and performance. The <b>pedal</b> <b>box</b> {{is an integral part of}} the vehicle as the driver directly interacts with it making ergonomic considerations integral to the success of the design. The 2007 <b>pedal</b> <b>box</b> design emphasizes design for manufacture, adjustability, ergonomics and weight savings. An innovative design decreases the amount of space needed for the <b>pedal</b> <b>box</b> through the use of vertically mounted master cylinders while allowing for the d. river to adjust front to rear brake bias, brake pedal ratio, and location in the car. The design also causes a significant reduction in complexity and weight through a decrease in the number of components needed for manufacture. by Brad W. Schiller. Thesis (S. B.)
