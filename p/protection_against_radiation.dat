40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the spectral transmittance of some commonly dispensed ophthalmic lenses in Malaysia. The efficiency of these lenses in providing ocular <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> ultraviolet <b>radiation</b> was also examined. Eight lenses that are currently marketed in Malaysia as lenses with “UV-coating” were randomly selected for the testing. These lenses (Hoya, Essilor Orma, Optron, Sola, Igel, Zeiss, Vista Optics and American Optical) were obtained from a few optometric practices in Kuala Lumpur. They were marketed as lenses with "UV blocking" properties by virtue of the UV coat on them. A Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV- 160 A) was used to determine the spectral transmittance of these lenses. It was found that Hoya, Essilor, Optron, Sola and Igel lenses provided good <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> ultraviolet B <b>radiation.</b> However, there was transmission (10 to 15 %) of ultraviolet C radiation. It was also found that these lenses transmitted some ultraviolet A radiation, averaging at about 28 % for all 5 lenses. Zeiss, Vista Optics and American Optical lenses were all found to be capable of blocking ultraviolet C radiation. However, Zeiss lens transmitted some ultraviolet A and Vista Optics lens transmitted some ultraviolet A and B radiations as well. The American Optical lens was the only lens that blocked the transmission of all of ultraviolet radiations A, B and C. This study shows that UV-coated American Optical lenses as marketed in Malaysia provide sufficient <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> ultraviolet <b>radiation...</b>|$|R
5000|$|When motivations to go {{into space}} are realized, work on {{mitigating}} the most serious threats can begin. One of the biggest threats to astronaut safety in space is sudden radiation events from solar flares. The violent solar storm of August 1972, which occurred between the Apollo 16 and Apollo 17 missions, could have produced fatal consequences had astronauts been caught exposed on the lunar surface. [...] The best known <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>radiation</b> in space is shielding; an especially effective shield is water contained in large tanks surrounding the astronauts. [...] Unfortunately water has a mass of 1000 kilograms per cubic meter. A more practical approach would be to construct solar [...] "storm shelters" [...] that spacefarers can retreat to during peak events. [...] For this to work, however, there {{would need to be}} a space weather broadcasting system in place to warn astronauts of upcoming storms, much like a tsunami warning system warns coastal inhabitants of impending danger. Perhaps one day a fleet of robotic spacecraft will orbit close to the Sun, monitoring solar activity and sending precious minutes of warning before waves of dangerous particles arrive at inhabited regions of space.|$|E

40|$|Exposure to {{ultraviolet}} {{radiation from the}} sun is known to create a significant global disease burden. The most serious long-term consequences are malignant melanomas, squamous cell carcinomas and basal cell carcinomas. Sunburn is the best-known acute effect of excessive UV radiation while chronic exposures induce degenerative changes in {{the cells of the}} skin that lead to premature aging, photo-dermatoses, and actinic keratosis. Baldness is a common aging phenomenon for older men while younger men often choose to remove their head hair for aesthetic and social reasons. The reduction of hair on the head may, therefore, increase the risk of skin cancer. To investigate the UV protection offered by human hair, a series of controlled laboratory tests was carried out to measure the penetration characteristics through various thickness layers of human hair. The results show that human hair can provide excellent <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> UV <b>radiation.</b> A full set of hair can block UV radiation by 99 % providing good <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> UV <b>radiation</b> exposure thus reducing the risk of future skin cancer on the head...|$|R
