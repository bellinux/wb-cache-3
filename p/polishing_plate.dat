40|$|Abstract. A new {{composite}} <b>polishing</b> <b>plate</b> for polishing of CVD diamond films {{has been}} designed. The displacement and stress distributions {{of the high}} speed rotation <b>polishing</b> <b>plate</b> have been investigated due to centrifugal forces, and the polishing mechanism of super-high polishing has been analyzed by using X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy. The {{results showed that the}} displacements both in axial and radial increase with the increasing of the rotational speed. When the rotation speed reached to 1200 rad/s, the von Mises equivalent stress is about 242 MPa, which is safe for the composite <b>polishing</b> <b>plate.</b> Additional, the polishing mechanism is mainly the chemical reaction between carbon and titanium during the super-high speed polishing. At elevated temperature, the chemical reaction between oxygen and titanium, oxygen and carbon can also occur...|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} a physical model for polishing. It {{makes it possible}} to determine physico-chemical processes occurring at contactless chemo-mechanical polishing (CMP) of crystal surfaces. A balance equation for diffusion, convection and chemical flows is used to describe processes that are proceeding in the stationary case. The analytical expressions are obtained that relate polishing rate and surface form for processed material to the physical parameters of the proceeding processes. It was found that macrorelief of the processed surface depends not only on the velocity of <b>polishing</b> <b>plate</b> motion but also on the gap between the processed wafer and <b>polishing</b> <b>plate,</b> as well as active component diffusion in the etching solution. One would expect that, at processing conditions discussed, the surface form is the same for different materials, whatever the active component concentration and chemical reaction constant. The polishing rate substantially depends on the concentration of the etchant active component, chemical reaction, physical properties of sample material and etching liquid. It is shown that the inverse rate of dissolution is the sum of inverse limiting rates of chemical, diffusion and convection stages of the process. The expressions are obtained that make it possible to optimize technological modes of polishing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} obtain ultra-smooth and damage free {{substrate}} surfaces for MgO single-crystal substrate with high polishing efficiency, an experimental investigation based on systemically designed polishing experiments are presented and discussed. Considering the structural characteristics and chemical properties of the MgO single crystal, the experiments use a polishing slurry containing SiO 2 abrasives so that the process is performed under a combination of mechanical and chemical actions. The effects of the polishing process parameters, such as polishing pressure, rotational speed of <b>polishing</b> <b>plate,</b> and the flow rate and concentration of the polishing slurry, on the surface roughness and material removal rate (MRR) are analyzed. Finally, a recommendation is made for selecting the appropriate polishing parameters for MgO single crystal substrate, based on which a surface roughness of 0. 3 nm can be achieved on the MgO substrate in 20 min of polishing time...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Polishing with Flotative Abrasive Balls(FABs) {{is a kind}} of soft contact {{polishing}} means， and {{the conventional}} <b>polishing</b> <b>plate</b> and pad are not needed in this case. The pressure of polishing is the flotage which is the upward force that a fluid exerts on the FABs, but the movement of work piece is similar to that in conventional polishing, the removal rate and quality of polishing is influenced by FAB and its flotage. An experiment device is built up and two kinds of FAB are designed and produced. Some primary experiments are carried out in order to investigate the influences of the size of FABs on the removal rate and surface roughness in polishing with FABs. It is found from the experiments that the grain size and the layers of FAB may have great influence on the removal rate of polishing; the surface roughness is mainly decided by the ball diameter and the layers of FAB. The results of experiments are discussed and analyzed, it indicates that the efficiency and quality depend on flotage and the number of active grains when the velocity of workpiece is assigned...|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} dissertation was to develop numerical and analytical mechanics models accounting for nano-/micro-scale solid surface interaction. This was accomplished by developing finite element models of an asperity in adhesive sliding contact with a homogenous half-space and asperity micro-fracture due to normal and sliding contact of homogenous or layered half-spaces, and analytical models of nanoscale surface polishing and nanoparticle embedment on rough surfaces using a probabilistic approach. Adhesive interaction of a rigid asperity moving over a homogeneous elastic-plastic half-space was modeled by nonlinear springs obeying a constitutive law derived from the Lennard-Jones potential. The evolution of the normal and friction forces, subsurface stresses, and plastic deformation at steady-state sliding was examined {{in terms of the}} work of adhesion, interaction distance (interfacial gap), Maugis parameter, and plasticity parameter, using the finite element method (FEM). The deformation behavior of homogeneous elastic-perfectly plastic (EPP) and elastic-linear kinematic hardening plastic (ELKP) half-spaces subjected to repeated adhesive sliding contacts was also the objective of this analysis. Numerical results provided insight into the effects of the aforementioned parameters on the friction and normal forces, stress-strain response, and evolution of subsurface plasticity with the accumulation of sliding cycles. The steady-state mode of deformation due to repeated adhesive sliding contacts was examined for both EPP and ELKP material behavior. Subsurface cracking in a layered medium consisting of an elastic hard layer and an elastic-plastic substrate due to adhesive sliding against a rigid asperity was analyzed using linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) and FEM model. The dominance of shear and tensile mode of crack propagation was examined in terms of the interaction depth, layer thickness, crack location, crack length, work of adhesion, and mechanical properties of the thin layer and substrate materials. The effect of adhesion on asperity failure due to normal contact was also studied. The crack growth direction, dominant fracture mode, and crack growth rate were predicted as functions of the initial crack position, asperity interaction distance, interfacial properties, and mechanical properties. FEM results showed the occurrence of different crack mechanisms, such as of crack-face opening, slip, and stick. The evolution of the surface topography during nanoscale surface polishing was studied with a three-dimensional stochastic model that accounts for a multi-scale (fractal) surface roughness and elastic, elastic-plastic, and fully-plastic deformation of the asperities on the polished surface caused by hard abrasive nanoparticles embedded in the soft surface layer of a rigid polishing countersurface. Numerical results of the steady-state roughness of the polished surface, material removal rate, and wear coefficient were determined in terms of the apparent contact pressure, polishing speed, original topography and mechanical properties of the polished surface, average size and density of the nanoparticles, and surface roughness of the <b>polishing</b> <b>plate.</b> The density of hard abrasive nanoparticles embedded in the soft countersurface was predicted by a probabilistic-hydrodynamic model in terms of the surface topographies, particle size distribution, applied forces, macroscopic geometry of the moving surfaces, surface kinematics, and fluid properties. The findings of this dissertation yield new insight into the deformation behavior of adhesive contacts involving homogeneous and layered half-spaces, from the single asperity level to surfaces with multi-asperity topographies. The significance of the interfacial properties and material properties on adhesive asperity sliding contact, the effects of interfacial adhesion and crack properties on asperity cracking and subsurface cracking, and the dependence of the surface topography evolution during nanoscale polishing on the surface topographies, material properties, and abrasive nanoparticle size were examined in the context of numerical and analytical results. The results of this thesis elucidate the mechanical aspects of surface contact interaction in nano/microscale engineering components and surfacing processes, such as hard-disk drives, micro-electro-mechanical systems, and nanoscale surface polishing, and provide insight into the underlying reasons leading to mechanical failure of homogeneous and layered half-spaces subjected to surface tractions. Solutions and FEM results for single-asperity contacts obtained in this work can be integrated into probabilistic analyses of contacting rough surfaces to advance the current state of contact mechanics of surfaces exhibiting multi-asperity topographies...|$|E
