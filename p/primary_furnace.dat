40|$|Casting is a final {{metallurgical}} {{operation in}} steel metallurgy. After the melting in <b>primary</b> <b>furnace</b> (BOF,EAF), steel is tapped in steel ladle, treated on secondary furnace (ladle furnace) and finally sent for ingot casting. After cooling, casting products (ingots) are treated in forge plant or rolling mill. The final result of ingot casting {{is to make}} simple geometrical shapes aimed for further plastic deformation. The modern approach for ingot casting implicates an application of secondary metallurgy, steel degassing and casting. For this concept application {{it is necessary to}} have appropriate devices and equipment and to lead the process as per exact technological instructions. In this elaborate the modern concept of ingot casting with main characteristic is given, but focus will be on the equipment and devices necessary for casting technology...|$|E
40|$|Batch {{combustion}} {{of fixed}} beds of coal, bagasse and blends thereof {{took place in}} a pre-heated two-stage electric laboratory furnace, under high-heating rates. The average input fuel/air equivalence ratios were similar for all fuels. The primary and secondary furnace temperatures were varied from 800 degrees C to 1000 degrees C. The effects of fuel blending, combustion staging, and operating furnace temperatures on the emissions from the two fuels were assessed. Furnace effluents were analyzed for carbon dioxide and for products of incomplete combustion (PIC) including CO, volatile and semi-volatile hydrocarbons, as well as particulate matter. Results showed that whereas CO 2 was generated during both the observed sequential volatile matter and char combustion phases of the fuels, PICs were only generated during the volatile matter combustion phase. CO 2 emissions were the highest from coal, whereas CO and other PIC emissions were the highest from bagasse. Under this particular combustion configuration, combustion of the volatile matter of the blends resulted in lower yields of PIC, than combustion of the volatiles of the neat fuels. Though CO and unburned hydrocarbons from coal {{as well as from the}} blends did not exhibit a clear trend with furnace temperature, such emissions from bagasse clearly increased with temperature. The presence of the secondary furnace (afterburner) typically reduced PIC, by promoting further oxidation of the <b>primary</b> <b>furnace</b> effluents. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The scope of the project was limited to consideration of available technology so that industry-wide application could be achieved by 1985. A search of the literature, coupled with interviews with representatives of major steel producers, served as the means whereby the techniques and technologies indicated for the specific site are extrapolated to the industry as a whole and to the 1985 time frame. The conclusion of the study is that by 1985, a national yearly savings of 1. 9 million barrels of oil could be realized through recovery of waste heat from <b>primary</b> arc <b>furnace</b> fume gases on an industry-wide basis. Economic studies indicate that the proposed system has a plant payback time of approximately 5 years...|$|R
40|$|The {{chain of}} {{production}} of {{glass in the}} Roman to Byzantine period appears to have consisted of two phases. First, raw glass was made from a silica component fluxed by an alkali component in huge glass furnaces, called tank furnaces. These centres of primary glass production were located close to the sources of alkali and/or silica. For the silica component quartz sand was used, while natron {{was used for the}} alkali component. Next, the freshly made primary glass was broken up into chunks and distributed to secondary glass workshops where it was again melted to shape and/or blow it into artefacts. This paper presents an interdisciplinary study based on a combination of archaeological and archaeometrical research. Excavated <b>primary</b> glass <b>furnaces</b> are used to build a 3 D CFD model of the ancient furnaces. Based on CFD calculations we provided further technical insights into the ancient production process such as the duration of the melting process, the amount of energy needed, the evolution of the temperature in the furnaces, etc. We also illustrate that the huge size of the ancient <b>primary</b> glass <b>furnaces</b> could be explained by the existence of economies of scale. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The archaeometric {{study of}} glass from Rocca di Monselice (Italy) focuses on 8 samples characterised {{by the same}} archaeological type, the goblet Isings 111, and a {{well-defined}} date, with the aims of identifying raw materials and production technology used during the 7 th century AD, analogies or differences with early Medieval glass from the Mediterranean area, and possible relationships between chemical composition and archaeological type. These aims were performed by combining chemical analyses carried out by means of X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and electron micro-probe (EMPA), and multivariate statistical treatment of chemical data. Results of chemical analyses show that all the samples are silica-soda-lime in composition, with natron as a flux, {{in accordance with the}} production technology of the period of interest. Multivariate statistical analysis allow us to split the Monselice samples into three compositional groups; two are chemically comparable to literature groups named Levantine 1 (4 samples from Monselice) and Group 2 (2 samples), respectively, and the third shows an intermediate composition between Levantine 1 and Group 2 (2 samples). The preponderance, in Monselice, of glass samples with Levantine 1 composition, as well as their good chemical comparability with those coming from the <b>primary</b> <b>furnaces</b> of the Syro-Palestinian coast, without evidence of recycling, supports the hypothesis of wide diffusion in Mediterranean area of this glass composition, which reaches its circulation peak during 7 th- 8 th centuries AD. In Monselice assemblage, the occurrence of samples with other chemical compositions, but having the same archaeological type and date, demonstrates, as already pointed out in other Italian sites, that there is not direct correlation between archaeological type and chemical composition, at least for very common types, such as the goblet Isings 111...|$|R

40|$|During the Late Roman and Byzantine period, natron {{glass was}} made from its raw {{materials}} in {{a limited number of}} primary production centres in Egypt and Syro-Palestine. For the earlier Hellenistic and Roman period, no <b>primary</b> <b>furnaces</b> have been found and the location of primary production during this era remains unclear. Ancient authors such as Strabo and Pliny the Elder suggest that glassmaking sands were found near the River Belus (Israel), in Egypt, near the mouth of the Volturno River (Italy) and also in Spain and France. However, primary production {{in the western part of}} the Mediterranean is not supported by any direct archaeological evidence and possible sand raw materials from these regions have never been evaluated for their suitability to produce glass. In this study 178 modern beach sands from Spain, France and Italy were analysed for their major and minor elemental compositions. By calculating the composition of the glasses that can be produced with these sediments after the addition of pure natron, and comparison with the composition of typical Roman natron glass, we were able to judge whether or not these sands are suitable for Roman glass production. The results indicate that good glassmaking sands are rather rare. Only a very limited number of the 178 analysed beach sands would produce a glass with major and minor elemental compositions within the ranges of Roman imperial natron glass. The rest of the analysed sands are unsuitable for glass production in their present form due to their insufficient SiO 2, high Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3 and either too low or too high CaO contents. If the sand raw material was too low in CaO, extra lime could be added to the glass batch in the form of shell or limestone. This was taken into account in a second calculation. Overall we were able to define six limited areas where suitable sand raw materials would have been available to the Roman glassmaker. Good glassmaking sands occur in the Basilicata and Puglia regions (SE Italy), and Tuscany (W Italy).

However, primary production {{in the western part of}} the Mediterranean is not supported by any direct archaeological evidence and possible sand raw materials from these regions have never been evaluated for their suitability to produce glass. In this study the possible existence of a Roman primary glass industry in the western Mediterranean is investigated, based on the occurrence of suitable sand raw materials. 178 beach sands from Spain, France and Italy are evaluated for their suitability for glass production by calculating the composition of hypothetical glasses made from these sands and comparing them to Roman natron glass. The results show that good glassmaking sands are far from common. Only a very limited number of the 178 beach sands analysed would produce a glass with major and minor elemental compositions within the ranges of Roman imperial natron glass. The rest of the sands analysed are unsuitable for glass production in their present form due to their insufficient SiO 2, high Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3, and either too low or too high CaO contents.

After the addition of an extra source of lime, sands from the Huelva Province (SW Spain), the Murcia Region (SE Spain) and from the Provence (SE France) would also produce glasses with a typical Roman composition. The suitability of the suggested sands was checked by performing a series of melting experiments, which provide further insights in the way Roman glass makers would have had to prepare their raw materials and the used batch recipes. Because of the complex nature of Roman natron glass, the provenance determination of this material remains one of the most challenging problems in the field of archaeometry. In the past decades, several attempts have been made to determine the provenance of ancient glass based on major, minor and trace elemental compositions, rare earth element patterns and isotopic signatures of O, Pb, Sr and Nd. Unfortunately, the major elemental composition of natron glass is relatively uniform and specific objects can almost never be uniquely assigned to their origin. Although the use of Sr and Nd isotope ratios and trace element signatures as an indication of provenance has proven promising, there are still unknown factors. The bulk of the Sr in natron glass is believed to have been incorporated with the lime bearing material. Where the lime was derived from Holocene seashell, the Sr isotopic composition of the glass would reflect that of modern seawater. Where the lime was derived from geologically aged limestone, the signature would reflect that of seawater at the time the limestone was deposited, possibly modified by diagenesis. However, also other minerals in the sand, such as feldspar and mica, can influence the Sr budget of the glass batch. Nd in natron based glass originates from the non-quartz mineral fraction of the silica raw material, which is most probably sand. It is well known that the &# 949;Nd value of deep-sea sediments in the eastern Mediterranean varies significantly due to the varying sediment influx from the Nile (fluvial), the Sahara (eolian) and the European continent (fluvial) and shows a pronounced E-W gradient from as high as - 1 at the mouth of the River Nile and the coasts of Egypt and Israel, to - 12 south of Sicily. In the western Mediterranean, the distribution of the Nd isotopic composition is less well known. Only very few results for river particulates and deep sea sediments are published and they all show rather low &# 949;Nd value of around - 10. Although it is not possible to directly compare the Nd isotopic signature of glass to sea-floor sediment, such significant differences between the easternmost part of the Mediterranean Sea and the rest of the basin offer a great potential in tracing the origins of sand raw materials used in primary glass production. Trace elements in raw natron glass are related to the accessory minerals in the glassmaking sand. The mineralogy of the heavy mineral fraction of a sand deposit is determined by the composition of the source rocks and is often a good indication of its origin. However, also the other raw materials, such as the natron and the lime, introduce traces of specific elements to the glass batch. Especially the transition metals, such as Mn, Co, Cu, Sb and Pb, are strongly influenced by the addition of colouring or decolouring agents. Recycling of glass cullet, including small quantities of coloured glass, results in elevated concentrations of these elements. In this study, the applicability of Sr and Nd isotopes and trace elemental analysis for provenancing natron glass is evaluated. A database of Sr and Nd isotopic compositions of possible sand raw materials from the western Mediterranean is presented, as a means of comparison for the growing number of isotopic studies on ancient glass. It is shown that the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio in natron glass is significantly influenced by the silicate fraction of the sand used and does not always provide a clear indication of the lime source used. The 143 Nd/ 144 Nd isotope ratio and &# 949;Nd value of sands is a good indicator for their geological (and sometimes geographical) provenance. The variation of the isotopic composition of Nd in beach sands along the Mediterranean coasts of Spain, France and Italy is presented, and the relation between the Nd isotopic signatures and geologically distinct regions is explained. The use of the isotopic signature of Nd as a proxy for the source of silica in glass is, however, not always straightforward because of the possible overlap of signatures from different suppliers. However, when used in combination with trace element geochemistry, raw natron glass and sand raw materials from the known production centres in the Levant can be readily distinguished from the suitable glassmaking sands identified in the western part of the Mediterranean. Ti, Cr, Sr, Zr and Ba are shown to be the most useful elements for provenancing natron glass. A comparison between the range of the Nd isotope ratios of suitable glassmaking sands and archaeological natron glass from around the Mediterranean, indicates primary production in both the east and west. Hellenistic and Roman (2 nd century BC to 4 th century AD) natron glasses show a wide range of Nd isotopic compositions. This may suggest raw glass production all around the Mediterranean Sea but can also reflect intense recycling of glass from a few big glass producers scattered around the Mediterranean. During the Late Roman, Byzantine and Early Islamic period (5 th to 7 th century AD) large scale raw glass production appears to be restricted to the eastern Mediterranean. nrpages: 148 status: publishe...|$|R
