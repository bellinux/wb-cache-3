40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of price {{regulation}} and <b>parallel</b> <b>imports</b> in the on-patent pharmaceutical market. In a theory model where the producer price is subject to bargaining between the brand-name producer and a distributor, we show that {{the effects of}} stricter price regulation crucially depend on whether the producer faces competition from <b>parallel</b> <b>imports.</b> While <b>parallel</b> <b>imports</b> improve the bargaining position of the distributor, price regulation counteracts this effect and may even be pro. table for the producer. We test the implications of our model on a unique dataset with information on sales and prices at both producer and retail level for 165 substances over four years (2004 - 7). We show that stricter price regulation reduces competition from <b>parallel</b> <b>imports,</b> and has no (strictly negative) effect on producer profits in the presence (absence) of <b>parallel</b> <b>imports.</b> Our results suggest that price regulation might improve static efficiency without being harmful for dynamic e 2 ciency in the presence of <b>parallel</b> <b>imports...</b>|$|R

40|$|We generalize {{an earlier}} model of {{international}} vertical pricing to explain key features of <b>parallel</b> <b>imports,</b> or unauthorized trade in legitimate goods.

Although <b>parallel</b> <b>imports</b> can be deterred when the manufacturer's wholesale price is sufficiently high, there is a trade-off between improving vertical pricing efficiency and reducing <b>parallel</b> <b>imports.</b> In equilibrium, <b>parallel</b> <b>imports</b> can come from a country with higher retail prices, {{which is consistent with}} some factual data. While countries have varying interests in such a policy, restricting <b>parallel</b> <b>imports</b> tends to increase global welfare when trade cost is high, but may reduce welfare when trade cost is low. This finding suggests that open parallel trading regimes may be most appropriate within regional trade agreements. <b>Parallel</b> <b>imports,</b> vertical price formation, intellectual property rights,...|$|R
