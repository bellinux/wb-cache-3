40|$|Expedition clothes have {{to fulfill}} high requirements, {{especially}} {{in terms of}} resistance, thermal comfort and moisture transport. Thermoactive membrane textile materials are commonly used to satisfy all these needs. To improve visual properties of these textiles, a modification to achieve self-clean superhydrophobic surface (known as “Lotus Effect”) can be used. As an implementation of this idea, glow discharge RF capacitively coupled plasma processing of industry materials with inert as well as <b>polymerizing</b> <b>gases</b> was performed. The self-clean properties were checked empirically with dust and solid particles with good results. To compare different treatment conditions, water contact angle (CA) was measured. In most cases significant increase of the CA in relation to raw materials was observed, with the best values achieving 155 °. Surface analyses by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and SEM-EDX spectroscopy were performed. A thin deposited layer with characteristic globular structure was found at the fiber surface treated by organosilicon plasma. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R

Manifold in vitro studies clearly indicated that FA is genotoxic. FA induced various genotoxic effects in proliferatin cultured mammalian cells. A variety of evidence suggests that the primary DNA alterations after FA exposure are DNA-protein crosslinks. Incomplete repair of DPX can lead to the formation of mutations...|$|R
40|$|Formaldehyde (CH 2 O), {{the most}} simple and {{reactive}} aldehyde, is a colorless, reactive and readily <b>polymerizing</b> <b>gas</b> {{at room temperature}} (National Toxicology Program [NTP]. It has a pungent suffocating odor that is recognized by most human subjects at concentrations below 1 ppm. Aleksandr Butlerov synthesized the chemical in 1859, but it was August Wilhelm von Hofmann who identified it as the product formed from passing methanol and air over a heated platinum spiral in 1867. This method is still {{the basis for the}} industrial production of formaldehyde today, in which methanol is oxidized using a metal catalyst. By the early 20 th century, with the explosion of knowledge in chemistry and physics, coupled with demands for more innovative synthetic products, the scene was set for the birth of a new material–plastics. According to the Report on Carcinogens, formaldehyde ranks 25 th in the overall U. S. chemical production, with more than 5 million tons produced each year. Formaldehyde annual production rises up to 21 million tons worldwide and it has increased in China with 7. 5 million tons produced in 2007. Given its economic importance and widespread use, many people are exposed to formaldehyde environmentally and/or occupationally. Commercially, formaldehyde is manufactured as an aqueous solution called formalin, usually containing 37 % by weight of dissolved formaldehyde. This chemical is present in all regions of the atmosphere arising from the oxidation of biogenic and anthropogenic hydrocarbons. Formaldehyde concentration levels range typically from 2 to 45 ppbV (parts per billion in a given volume) in urban settings that are mainly governed by primary emissions and secondary formation...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} study is performed {{to understand and}} show the potential of high-speed, deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) of silicon using oxygen inhibitor pulses {{as a replacement for}} hydro-fluorocarbons (HFCs). This process might be considered the 'holy grail' in DRIE as the environmental restrictions for the use of HFCs are becoming increasingly stronger. When compared to the usual cryogenic mixed oxygen DRIE and with respect to profile control, the proposed cryogenic pulsed oxygen DRIE is virtually independent of silicon loading, mask material and trench width, and it is less prone to the formation of black silicon (BS). Some indication is found that one of the major causes for the formation of BS is the existence of dust inside the plasma. Dust is created when oxygen and silicon tetra fluoride (SiF 4 being the reaction product of silicon etching) coincide inside the plasma glow. This occurs in mixed oxygen plasma; the silica dust falls onto the wafer where it starts to form BS when directional etching is requested. Dust particles can also form when strong <b>polymerizing</b> <b>gases</b> are fed into the plasma. This is the case for the Bosch process using HFC pulses forming carbonic dust. The particles, and consequently the BS, are observed to be limited when the SiF 4 and O 2 gases are time separated, which forms the basis of the proposed pulsed oxygen DRIE. Another advantage of pulsed oxygen DRIE with respect to Bosch processing is that the protective skin of the sidewall during etching—a kind of native oxide—is believed to be self-terminating. This makes the process insensitive to profile variations caused by parameter fluctuations. It is found that inhibiting oxygen pulses give excellent results with respect to profile control at cryogenic temperatures (between − 120 and − 80 °C) and can still compete with HFC pulses up to intermediate low temperatures (between − 80 and − 40 °C). When selecting the proper DRIE conditions, the oxygen pulsed mode performs with excellent profile verticality and selectivity while keeping the silicon clean. It also shows a high etch rate up to 25 µm min− 1 (< 1 % Si load of a 100 mm wafer). When the temperature is raised further (between − 40 and 0 °C), the strength of the oxygen sidewall protection progressively fails and more oxygen with more bias is needed to keep sufficient profile directionality. The use of stronger oxide-forming agents is suggested in order to enable good performance at the more convenient, higher temperature, low bias conditions...|$|R

40|$|Silica (SiO_ 2) {{thin film}} was {{synthesized}} using organic silane compound by a Low Pressure Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition. Triethyl orthosilicate (TRIES) {{was used as}} source material. Operation conditions: pressure: 1 ～ 100 Torr at outlet of the reactor, temperature: 600 ～ 900 ℃. The experimental {{results showed that the}} high reaction temperature and high source gas concentration lead to higher growth rate of SiO_ 2, and better step coverage on micro scale trenches. We propose a reaction model in which the source <b>gas</b> <b>polymerizes</b> and produces origomers (dimer, trimer, tetramer etc.), the origomers diffuse and condense on the solid surface. The condensed origomers flow into the trenches and then reaction takes place to realize good step coverage films. The chemical species in gas phase at the outlet of reactor tube were analyzed by quadrapole mass spectrometer. The peaks, assigned to be monomer, dimer of source gas and heavier molecules, were observed at 650 ℃ or 700 ℃. At higher temperature (900 ℃), the peaks of heavy molecules disappear, because the almost all of source gas and intermediate (highly polymerized origomer) molecules are oxidized or condensed on colder tube walls...|$|R
40|$|Cyclopentene {{is known}} to undergo {{equilibrium}} polymerization through a metathesisreaction which its bulk and solution polymerizations have been thoroughly inves-tigated. However, {{we have found that}} under specific experimental conditions, this monomer <b>polymerizes</b> in the <b>gas</b> phase. The gas phase polymerization is defined here as the conversion of pure gaseous monomer into polymer in the condensed phase. Pure gaseous cyclopentene is found to polymerize on a glass surface in {{the upper part of the}} ampoule above the liquid phase when the polymerization is initiated with only tungsten hexachloride. Polymerizations are carried out under high vacuum and in the 10 - 60 oC temperature range. In presence of methanol, the colourless formed polymer shrinks slightly, then it can be removed easily from the glass surface and simply dried under vac-uum without any other purification process. From kinetic measurements, an overall acti-vation energy of 63. 47 kJ/mol is obtained for the conversion of one mole of gaseous monomer to one unit of condensed polymer. GPC Chromatograms of polymer samples are compared with chromatograms of polystyrene standards obtained in the same condi-tions in chloroform. All polymer chromatograms show a narrow molar mass distribution. Elution peaks of the polymer correspond to peaks obtained for the standards with high molar mass ranging from 2 × 104 to above 2 × 106 g/mol. 1 H NMR Spectra at 200 MHz show no loss of double bonds in the polymer, nor any presence of tertiary proton. This results indicate that the polymer is linear and branching or cross-linking, if present, can-not be detected. Spectra obtained through 13 C NMR spectrometry at 22. 63 MHz allow the determination of the proportion of cis and trans configurations...|$|R
40|$|A {{partially}} neutralized {{sodium acrylate}} (NaAc) monomer was <b>polymerized</b> in the <b>gas</b> {{phase in the}} presence of ammonium peroxydisulfate [(NH 4) 2 S 2 O 8] as the primary initiator and zinc acetate (ZnAc) as the coinitiator. The effect of the coinitiator on the solution properties of the spray-polymerized product was investigated for the conversion percentage as a function of (1) the primary initiator (NH 4) 2 S 2 O 8 concentration, with the concentration (14. 8 % with respect to the monomer) of the coinitiator kept constant; (2) the coinitiator (ZnAc) concentration, with the primary initiator concentration (4 % with respect to the monomer) kept constant; and (3) the reaction temperature. The viscosity of the product {{as a function of the}} coinitiator concentration was also investigated. The conversion percentage of gas-phase-polymerized NaAc increased by approximately 8 % (i. e., from 91. 6 to 99. 3 %) with an increasing (NH 4) 2 S 2 O 8 concentration (0. 5 - 5 % with respect to the monomer). The conversion percentage as a function of the coinitiator concentration (0 - 15 % with respect to the monomer) increased by 25 % (from 75 to 100 %). When the concentrations of the initiators (NH 4) 2 S 2 O 8 and ZnAc were kept constant at 4 and 14. 8 % (with respect to the monomer), respectively, the conversion increased from 48 to 83 % when the reaction temperature was increased from 100 to 140 °C. The viscosity (at 20 °C) of sodium polyacrylate decreased with an increasing coinitiator concentration. The relative rate of polymerization, as a function of the pH of the polymer, showed a minimum at pH ≈ 6 and subsequently increased steeply, reaching a plateau at pH ≈ 11; it then decreased again very sharply. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
