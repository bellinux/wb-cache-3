[...] The <b>plea</b> <b>agreements</b> implicate all four men, Peace, Phillips, Taylor and Vick in both dog fighting and the killing of dogs.

5|$|In August 2011, Meir Abergil {{returned}} to Israel after a California court had approved a <b>plea</b> <b>agreement</b> setting him free. In May 2012, Itzhak Abergil was sentenced by a Los Angeles {{federal court to}} 10 years in prison with credit for time served, after pleading guilty to {{being part of a}} racketeering enterprise that distributed Ecstasy and whose members killed a man for stealing a large drug shipment.

Under the terms of the agreement, she was required to undergo psychological counseling and treatment for drug and alcohol abuse for a two-year period in order to avoid a prison sentence.

40|$|A {{sentencing}} appellate waiver is {{a criminal}} defendant’s promise not to appeal her sentence. These provisions routinely appear in federal defendants’ <b>plea</b> <b>agreements.</b> With a few narrow exceptions, a knowing and voluntary sentencing appellate waiver bars a defendant from appealing all issues within the waiver’s scope. Using models of judicial behavior and empirical studies, this Article argues that the inclusion of sentencing appellate waivers in <b>plea</b> <b>agreements</b> creates bargaining inefficiencies and removes important incentives from the sentencing process. As a solution, the Article proposes that sentencing appellate waivers should {{take the form of}} separate post-sentencing agreements...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} negotiated <b>plea</b> <b>agreements</b> {{introduced by the}} Attorney General in 2009 for cases of serious or complex fraud, {{and the degree to}} which these differ from <b>plea</b> <b>agreements</b> reached through informal plea bargaining in other types of criminal case. It first considers whether the formally negotiated agreements are a result of coercion being brought to bear on defendants, or of defendants ‘playing the system’ (the two most common criticisms of ordinary plea bargains). It is then argued that an alternative conceptualisation may be more appropriate in serious fraud cases. To this end, approaches to plea bargaining more commonly applied in the United States (consensual, concessions, and contractual models) are considered in light of the current context. It is submitted that whilst these approaches have only limited application to defendants in ordinary criminal cases, they may help explain the dynamic of <b>plea</b> <b>agreements</b> in serious fraud cases. This in turn provides a basis upon which to assess the fairness of negotiated pleas in serious fraud cases, and highlights issues which lie at the core of the plea bargaining debate...|$|R

5|$|In 2000, Governor Ryan {{placed a}} {{moratorium}} on executions in Illinois after courts exonerated and freed 13 death row inmates who had been wrongfully convicted. Ryan also promised to review the cases of all Illinois death row inmates. Given {{the number of cases}} of alleged brutality to be investigated, inmates who claimed to have been abused and gave coerced confessions were offered reduced sentences in exchange for dropping charges. A <b>plea</b> <b>agreement</b> was reached with one convicted victim. Illinois State's Attorney Devine made a broader offer to several inmates. Aaron Patterson rejected the plea deal.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{in early}} 1973, Agnew was {{investigated}} by the United States Attorney for the District of Maryland on suspicion of conspiracy, bribery, extortion and tax fraud. Agnew had accepted payments from contractors during his time as a Maryland official, and the payments had continued into his time as vice president. After denying his guilt for months, Agnew negotiated a <b>plea</b> <b>agreement</b> that would involve his resignation from office.

50|$|Santobello v.

50|$|By August 20, all the {{defendants}} {{on the initial}} federal charges including Vick had agreed to guilty pleas under <b>plea</b> bargain <b>agreements,</b> apparently avoiding facing the possibility of additional and more serious charges under the powerful Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. U.S. District Court Judge Henry E. Hudson, who is not bound by sentencing recommendations in <b>plea</b> <b>agreements,</b> had previously advised two of {{the defendants}} that the aggravated circumstances involving executing the dogs warranted an upward revision of the sentencing guidelines. The single felony charges carry a maximum sentence of five years.|$|R

5|$|In August 2011, Meir Abergil {{was freed}} and {{returned}} to Israel after having served about {{three years in prison}} first in Israel and then in the United States. Charged with blackmailing U.S. businessmen to whom the brothers had lent money, he allegedly had played a relatively minor role in the crimes and is thought to have been involved mainly in the extortion of Asi Vaknin, who was arrested in Mexico and brought to the United States in April 2011, but refuses to testify against the Abergils. As a result, U.S. authorities reportedly were not able to build a case against Meir Abergil, leading to a <b>plea</b> <b>agreement</b> approved by a California court in which Abergil confessed to extortion of over a million dollars from another mob figure. In Israel, he faces criminal charges pending against him in the district court in Petah Tikva over allegations regarding his involvement in an Internet gambling business set up about 10 years ago which operated in many locations in Israel, including Internet cafes, convenience stores, soccer lottery outlets and nightclubs functioning as casinos. According to his lawyer, Abergil′s involvement in the alleged activities was marginal.|$|E
5|$|The FBI raid {{led to the}} {{formation}} of Colorado's first special grand jury, the juried testimony of 110 witnesses, reviews of 2,000 exhibits and ultimately a 1992 <b>plea</b> <b>agreement</b> in which Rockwell admitted to 10 federal environmental crimes and agreed to pay $18.5 million in fines out of its own funds. This amount was less than the company had been paid in bonuses for running the plant as determined by the GAO, and yet was also by far the highest hazardous-waste fine ever; four times larger than the previous record. Due to DOE indemnification of its contractors, without some form of settlement being arrived at between the U.S. Justice Department and Rockwell the cost of paying any civil penalties would ultimately have been borne by U.S. taxpayers. While any criminal penalties allotted to Rockwell would not have been covered by U.S. taxpayers, Rockwell claimed that the Department of Energy had specifically exempted them from most environmental laws, including hazardous waste.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Taylor {{started having}} {{troubles}} {{in his personal}} life again. On November 8, {{he was arrested in}} Miami-Dade County, Florida for leaving the scene of an accident after striking another vehicle with his Cadillac Escalade. He had already committed the same offense in 1996 when he totaled his Lexus in a one-car accident and left the scene, saying he did not think the law required the reporting of a single driver incident. He was released on a $500 bond, and the other driver later sued him, seeking $15,000. He was arrested six months later for having sex with a 16-year-old girl at a Holiday Inn located in Montebello, New York. He was charged with felony third-degree statutory rape, for allegedly engaging in sexual intercourse with someone under 17. He was also charged with third-degree patronization for allegedly paying the underage girl $300 to have sex with him. The girl was represented by celebrity attorney Gloria Allred when Taylor pleaded guilty on March 22, 2011 and was sentenced to six years probation as part of a <b>plea</b> <b>agreement,</b> in which he pleaded guilty to the misdemeanors of sexual misconduct and patronizing a prostitute. He will also have to register as a low-risk level one sex offender. On October 26, 2012, a court rejected the victim's claims that Taylor assaulted her.|$|E
