This {{particular}} flat has many memories {{for me and}} {{is a very interesting}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> history. In what would have been John's 70th year, I am grateful to you all for commemorating John and this particular part of his London life, one which spawned so much of his great music and great art.|$|E
5|$|Senator McCarthy's zeal {{to uncover}} {{subversion}} and espionage led to disturbing excesses. His browbeating tactics destroyed careers {{of people who}} were not involved in the infiltration of our government. His freewheeling style caused both the Senate and the Subcommittee to revise the rules governing future investigations, and prompted the courts to act to protect the Constitutional rights of witnesses at Congressional hearings.... These hearings are a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> national past that we can neither afford to forget nor permit to reoccur.|$|E
5|$|Hume also {{suggested}} that, {{as we have}} no abstract idea of existence (apart from as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> ideas of other objects), we cannot claim {{that the idea of}} God implies his existence. He suggested that any conception of God we may have, we can conceive either of existing or of not existing. He believed that existence is not a quality (or perfection), so a completely perfect being need not exist. Thus, he claimed {{that it is not a}} contradiction to deny God's existence. Although this criticism is directed against a cosmological argument, similar to that of Samuel Clarke in his first Boyle Lecture, it has been applied to ontological arguments as well.|$|E

5|$|I {{think that}} the band went on... maybe not a tangent, {{but we had a}} goal in mind, {{and at the end of}} the {{recording}} process, we were so proud of how artistic we were. And I think we showed too much. I think maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, and I {{think that the}} lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But I think that it's all <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E
5|$|The {{team was}} {{generally}} very well received outside London, {{and especially in}} north, where rugby was dominated by the working-class. Reaction to the team in the south, where the public school establishment controlled the game, was less positive, and the sportsmanship of the team was criticised. Despite this, Ellison clearly enjoyed the experience of touring with the team, and in 1902 he wroteâ€”"I shall never forget the trip, notwithstanding the extremely heavy programme of fixtures {{we had to go}} through. Perhaps the most delightful <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> experiences was tasted not so much on the field of play as off it".|$|E
5|$|Obama's {{inaugural address}} {{received}} mixed reviews, with some describing {{the tone of}} the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the speech as low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about {{the tone of the}} speech, saying that the speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the speech as one that emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> American heritage.|$|E

5|$|Thus {{our actions}} are predetermined, and are causally {{related to the}} {{overarching}} network of fate, but nevertheless the moral responsibility of how we respond to impressions remains our own. The one all-determining power is active everywhere, working in each particular being according to its nature, whether in rational or irrational creatures or in inorganic objects. Every action is {{brought about by the}} co-operation of causes depending on the nature of things and the character of the agent. Our actions would only be involuntary if they were produced by external causes alone, without any co-operation, on the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> wills, with external causes. Virtue and vice are set down as things in our power, for which, consequently, we are responsible. Moral responsibility depends only on freedom of the will, and what emanates from our will is our own, no matter whether it is possible for us to act differently or not. This rather subtle position which attempts to reconcile determinism with human responsibility is known as soft-determinism, or compatibilism.|$|E

60|$|In {{the next}} place let us consider, what {{influence}} these received maxims have upon the other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> knowledge. The rules {{established in the}} schools, that all reasonings are EX PRAECOGNITIS ET PRAECONCESSIS, seem to lay the foundation of all other knowledge in these maxims, and to suppose them to be PRAECOGNITA. Whereby, I think, are meant these two things: first, that these axioms are those truths that are first known to the mind; and, secondly, that upon them the other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> knowledge depend.|$|R

But when we read a story, not only do the language <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> brains light up, but any other <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the brain that we would use if we were actually experiencing what we're reading about becomes activated as well.

25|$|Logicism is {{the thesis}} that {{mathematics}} is reducible to logic, and hence nothing but a part of logic.

In this view, logic is the proper foundation of mathematics, and all mathematical statements are necessary logical truths.|$|E
25|$|Naples {{has played}} an {{important}} and vibrant role over the centuries {{not just in the}} music of Italy, but in the general history of western European musical traditions.

The vitality of Neapolitan popular music from the late 19th century has made such songs as O Sole mio and FuniculÃ¬ FuniculÃ  a permanent <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> musical consciousness.|$|E
