5|$|Experiments {{confirming}} {{the role of}} kin selection in worker policing demonstrate the effects of multiple matings, {{which can lead to}} lower average relatedness between workers. Queens of the social wasp Dolichovespula saxonica mate singly or multiply. Researchers who study these wasps have observed a strong <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> worker relatedness and male production. After controlling for the absolute number of eggs laid, these scientists conclude that the queen's multiple matings favor mutual worker policing.|$|E

Extraverts have more blood flow in the anterior cingulate gyrus, temporal lobes, and posterior thalamus, which are involved in sensory and emotional experience. This study and other research indicates that introversion-extraversion is related to individual differences in brain function. A study on regional brain volume found a <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> introversion and grey matter volume in the right prefrontal cortex and right temporoparietal junction, {{as well as a}} <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> introversion and total white matter volume.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{financial}} crisis {{has resulted in}} the global economic depression. It is merely cultural industry that acts in a diametrically opposite way so businesses related to cultural industry are still growing. For this reason, this study tends to explore the innovation activities in cultural parks in Taiwan, from the aspect of cultural value. Nevertheless, research on cultural parks in Taiwan still focuses on architecture design and reuse of space; studies on Service Innovation are rather few. This study therefore aims to discuss Service Innovation in cultural parks themselves. With questionnaire survey, the data are further analyzed and discussed. The research findings show 1. significantly <b>positive</b> <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> Service Innovation and Product Price in Customer Satisfaction, 2. partially <b>positive</b> <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> Service Innovation and Service Efficiency in Customer Satisfaction, 3. remarkably <b>positive</b> <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> Service Innovation and Perceived Value in Customer Satisfaction, and 4. notable effects of Customer Characteristics on the <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> Service Innovation and Customer Satisfaction.

Respiratory chemical damaged veterans have many different psychiatric problems and low health-related quality of life. In this study, we evaluated the relations of spirometry parameters and health- related quality of life with mental health. Material and methods: This was a descriptive- co relational study done on 41 respiratory chemical veterans (Iran-Iraq war) selected with randomized available sampling in Tehran City. We used Spirometry test, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) & General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) for assessing the patients and Pearson's correlation matrix for analyzing the data. Results: There were significant negative <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> the total score of GHQ and depression subscale with FVC & FEV 1.

30|$|When we {{analysed}} {{the relationships}} between SWBQb and PWBS factors to assess the convergent validity of the SWBQb, we found 20 <b>positive</b> <b>correlations</b> out of 24 relationships that were tested, although they were weak (<[*]. 40). Previous international studies have reported <b>positive</b> <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> spiritual well-being and psychological well-being among English samples (Fisher, 2011; Rowold, 2011). A validation study of SWBQp, conducted in Portugal (Mangia, 2015) using the same instruments as in this study found evidence for the convergent validity of the SWBQp and also obtained a very similar number of <b>positive</b> <b>correlations</b> (19 correlations). The correlations reported by Mangia (2015) were similar in magnitude to those we observed, although slightly higher. The pattern of correlations was very similar in the two studies: <b>positive</b> <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> the SWBQ personal factor and all PWBS factors. Both studies also found <b>positive</b> <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> SWBQ-communal and PWBS-environmental mastery, PWBS-personal development, PWBS-positive relationships, PWBS-purpose in life and PWBS-self-acceptance. SWBQ-transcendental was not correlated with PWBS-personal development in either study. We found no <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> SWBQb-transcendental and PWBS-autonomy, but Mangia (2015) did find a very weak <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> these two factors in the Portuguese versions of the instruments. Finally, SWBQb-environment {{was positively correlated with}} all the PWBS factors except positive relationships. These results provide evidence of the convergent validity of the SWBQb and corroborate studies that have observed <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> spiritual well-being and psychological well-being in other countries (Fisher, 2011; Mangia, 2015; Rowold, 2011).|$|R

The foraging speed decreased as the workers aged and the time a worker spent in the nest between foraging trips increased as they got older.

25|$|Furthermore, the neuroendocrine {{system in}} adult males, which {{controls}} their mating behavior, must be stimulated before they will mate with a female. Protein {{in the male}} diet is not necessarily needed for this stimulation, but higher percentages of females were successfully inseminated by male specimens which had been fed either dung or beef liver versus specimens with a diet of only sugar. Protein is not generally necessary for spermatogenesis in male flies, but it is paramount for accessory reproductive gland development, higher rates of copulation, and the capability of impregnating females. An additional study found a <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> male head size {{and the size of}} the aedeagi (the external reproductive organs), which has been suggested as a possible reason for lower percentages of insemination between small males and large females within this species.|$|E
25|$|Some spiders, such as Pholcus phalangioides, will prey {{on their}} own kind when food is scarce. Also, females of Phidippus johnsoni have been {{observed}} carrying dead males in their fangs. This behavior may be triggered by aggression, where females carry over hostility from their juvenile state and consume males just as they would prey. Sih and Johnson surmise that non-reproductive cannibalism can occur due to a remnant of an aggression trait in juvenile females. Known as the “aggressive spillover hypothesis,” this tendency unselectively to attack anything that moves is cultivated by a <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> hostility, foraging capability, and fecundity. Aggression {{at a young age}} leads to an increase in prey consumption and as such, a larger adult size. This behavior “spills over” into adulthood, and shows up as a nonadaptive trait that manifests itself through adult females preying on males of their same species.|$|E

Income status, diet, and education all construct a higher burden for low income minorities, to be conscious about their health. Research conducted by medical departments at universities in San diego, Miami, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina suggested that minorities in regions where lower socioeconomic status is common, there was a direct relationship with unhealthy diets and greater distance of supermarkets. Therefore, in areas where supermarkets are less accessible (food deserts) to impoverished areas, the more likely these groups are to purchase inexpensive fast food or just follow an unhealthy diet. As a result, because food deserts are more prevalent in low income communities, minorities that reside in these areas are more prone obesity, {{which can lead to}} diseases such as chronic kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes.|$|E
