Tacking is defined as [...] "The joining of consecutive periods of possession by different persons to treat the periods as one continuous period; esp., the adding of one's own period of land possession to that of a prior possessor to establish continuous adverse possession for the statutory period." [...] There are three types of Privity: Privity of Contract; Privity of Possession; and <b>Privity</b> <b>of</b> <b>Estate.</b> [...] One of the three types of privity is required in order for one adverse possessor to [...] "tack" [...] their time onto another adverse possessor in order to complete the statutory time period. One way tacking occurs is when the conveyance of the property from one adverse possessor to another is founded upon a written document (usually an erroneous deed), indicating [...] "color of title." [...] A lawful owner may also restart the clock at zero by giving temporary permission for the occupation of the property, thus defeating the necessary [...] "continuous and hostile" [...] element. Evidence that a squatter paid rent to the owner would defeat adverse possession for that period.|$|E

40|$|<b>Privity</b> <b>of</b> {{contract}} {{has lately}} been criticized in several European jurisdictions, particu-larly {{due to the}} onerous consequences it gives rise to in arrangements typical for the modern exchange such as chains <b>of</b> contracts. <b>Privity</b> <b>of</b> contract is a classical premise of contract law, which prohibits a third party to acquire or enforce rights under a contract to which {{he is not a}} party. Such a premise is usually seen to be manifested in the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> contract developed under common law, however, the jurisdictions of continental Europe do recognize a corresponding starting point in contract law. One of the traditional industry sectors affected by this premise is the construction industry. A typical large construction project includes a contractual chain comprised of an employer, a main contractor and a subcontractor. The employer is usually dependent on the subcontractor's performance, however, no contractual nexus exists between the two. Accordingly, the employer might want to circumvent the <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> contract in order to reach the subcontractor and to mitigate any risks imposed by such a chain of contracts. From this starting point, the study endeavors to examine the concept <b>of</b> <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> con-tract in European jurisdictions and particularly the methods used to circumvent the rule in the construction industry practice. For this purpose, the study employs both a com-parative and a legal dogmatic method. The principal aim is to discover general principles not just from a theoretical perspective, but from a practical angle as well. Consequently, a considerable amount of legal praxis as well as international industry forms have been used as references. The most important include inter alia the model forms produced by FIDIC as well as Olli Norros' doctoral thesis "Vastuu sopimusketjussa". According to the conclusions of this study, the four principal ways to circumvent <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> contract in European construction projects include liability in a chain of contracts, collateral contracts, assignment of rights as well as security instruments. The contempo-rary European jurisdictions recognize these concepts and the references suggest that they {{are an integral part of}} the current market practice. Despite the fact that such means <b>of</b> circumventing <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> contract raise a number of legal questions and affect the risk position of particularly a subcontractor considerably, it seems that the impairment of the premise <b>of</b> <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> contract is an increasing trend in the construction industry...|$|R

50|$|To {{circumvent}} <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> <b>estate</b> {{which is}} the general principle flowing from privity of contract, laws exist in several jurisdictions to bind subtenants {{to some of the}} restrictive covenants (terms) of the headlease, for instance in England and Wales those which have been held by courts to touch and concern the land.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to this case, for {{covenants}} to run, {{the original}} agreement {{had to be}} made by a landlord and tenant at the time that they entered into the lease, that is, there had to be <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> <b>estate,</b> also called [...] "vertical privity."

50|$|No, {{said the}} Court of Appeals. The {{provision}} {{does not include}} a third party {{who does not have}} <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> contract with the seller if no negligence is implied. If there is no <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> contract between third persons and the seller of food, there can be no implied warranty. The benefit of warranty (either express or implied) does not run with the chattel on its resale (and thus is unlike a covenant running with land, which does give a subsequent purchaser a right of action on a warranty).|$|R
50|$|Lord Cottenham LC {{found in}} favour of the {{plaintiff}} and granted an injunction to restrain the defendant from violating the covenant. The Court noted that if the agreement had been a contract instead of a covenant, {{it would have been}} enforceable. Therefore the covenant was enforceable at equity, that is, when the plaintiff seeks an injunction as opposed to damages. The case stands for the proposition that vertical privity (<b>privity</b> <b>of</b> <b>estate)</b> is not required for the burden of a covenant to run at equity.|$|E
50|$|At common law, {{the burden}} of a {{restrictive}} covenant does not run except where strict <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> <b>estate</b> (a landlord/tenant relationship) exists. The burden can be enforced at law in limited circumstances under the benefit/burden test - that is, whoever takes the benefit must also shoulder the burden. In Halsall v Brizell 1957 Ch 169, a covenant requiring the upkeep of roads was found to bind the successor in title to the original covenantor because he had elected to take the benefit. A positive burden can run in law, but not in equity.|$|E
5000|$|Vertical privity {{characterizes the}} {{relationship}} between the original party to the covenant and the subsequent owner. To be bound by the covenant, the successor must hold the entire estate in land held by the original party (strict vertical <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> <b>estate).</b> Note that because strict vertical privity is required for a burden to run, a lessee could not have a burden enforced against them. However, a benefited party could sue the owner of the reversion of the estate, and the owner could possibly sue the lessee for waste.|$|E

In certain jurisdictions a policy against such encumbrances is so strongly felt that except as to covenants in leases the obligations of all covenants are in general unenforceable except against the original covenantors.
