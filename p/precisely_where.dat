5|$|For {{the human}} ear, {{it is often}} {{difficult}} to tell <b>precisely</b> <b>where</b> a cicada song originates. The pitch is nearly constant, the sound is continuous to the human ear, and cicadas sing in scattered groups. In addition to the mating song, many species have a distinct distress call, usually a broken and erratic sound emitted by the insect when seized or panicked. Some species also have courtship songs, generally quieter, and produced after a female has been drawn to the calling song. Males also produce encounter calls, whether in courtship or to maintain personal space within choruses.|$|E
5|$|Beagle was {{not allowed}} to land at Tenerife through fears that those aboard would bring cholera, but the ship {{proceeded}} to Cape Verde, Fernando de Noronha and Rio de Janeiro. She then spent some time surveying the coast of South America south from Rio de Janeiro, around Tierra del Fuego, the coast of Chile and as far north as Peru. Fitz-Roy finally detached Beagle from South America in August 1835. The Admiralty had not precisely specified his itinerary across the Pacific since they could not be sure how far north {{he would be able to}} survey in the time available, and hence <b>precisely</b> <b>where</b> he would be leaving from. But they did specify that he should stop at Tahiti, a point of previously well-determined longitude. The Admiralty also required that, like the journey across the Atlantic, it should be done in small stages to frequently rate the chronometers. Fitz-Roy chose to go via the Galápagos Islands. Subsequently Beagle visited Tahiti, New Zealand, Australia and Mauritius.|$|E

25|$|A major {{question}} {{considered in}} mathematical Platonism is: <b>Precisely</b> <b>where</b> {{and how do}} the mathematical entities exist, {{and how do we}} know about them? Is there a world, completely separate from our physical one, that is occupied by the mathematical entities? How can we gain access to this separate world and discover truths about the entities? One proposed answer is the Ultimate Ensemble, a theory that postulates that all structures that exist mathematically also exist physically in their own universe.|$|E
25|$|The {{assessed}} {{risk of a}} dive would {{generally be}} considered unacceptable if the diver {{is not expected to}} cope with any single reasonably foreseeable incident with a significant probability of occurrence during that dive. <b>Precisely</b> <b>where</b> the line is drawn depends on circumstances. Professional diving operations tend to be less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, who are less constrained by occupational health and safety legislation and codes of practice. This is one of the factors driving the use of surface supplied equipment where reasonably practicable for professional work.|$|E

25|$|In {{connection}} with healthcare philosophy, {{the theory of}} natural rights becomes a rather pertinent subject. After birth, man is effectively endowed {{with a series of}} natural rights that cannot be banished under any circumstances. One major proponent of natural rights theory was seventeenth-century English political philosopher John Locke. With regard to the natural rights of man, Locke states, Although partially informed by his religious understanding of the world, Locke's statement can essentially be viewed as an affirmation of the right to preserve one's life at all costs. This point is <b>precisely</b> <b>where</b> healthcare as a human right becomes relevant.|$|E
25|$|Between December 22 and December 29, 1978, 27 {{bodies were}} {{recovered}} from Gacy's property, 26 {{of which were}} found buried in his crawl space, with one additional victim, John Butkovitch, being found buried beneath the concrete floor of his garage <b>precisely</b> <b>where</b> Gacy had marked the youth's grave with a can of spray paint. Following a temporary postponement of the excavations imposed in January 1979 because of a severe winter snowfall in Chicago, excavations of the property resumed in March—despite Gacy's insistence to investigators that all the victims' bodies buried upon his property had been found.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} turmoil of Germany's troubled interwar years greatly affected the School's development. Its thinkers were particularly {{influenced by the}} failure of the communist revolution in Western Europe (<b>precisely</b> <b>where</b> Marx had predicted that a communist revolution would take place) and by the rise of Nazism in such an economically and technologically advanced nation as Germany. This led many of them to take up the task of choosing what parts of Marx's thought might serve to clarify contemporary social conditions that Marx himself had never seen. Another key influence also came from the publication in the 1930s of Marx's Economic-Philosophical Manuscripts and The German Ideology, which showed the continuity with Hegelianism that underlay Marx's thought.|$|E

Most of these victims, Fred claimed, had been hitchhikers or girls he had picked up at bus stops whom he had murdered in the 1970s. Initially, Fred claimed these six victims had been killed when they had threatened to inform Rose of his infidelity with women, {{and that he had}} transported their bodies to Cromwell Street to abuse, dismember, and then bury in shallow graves. The actual dismemberment, Fred claimed, had made it easier to bury the remains in shallow, cubicle graves, and he agreed to return to Cromwell Street to indicate <b>precisely</b> <b>where</b> he had buried each victim.|$|E

500|$|Bertrand Russell, {{during his}} early Hegelian phase, {{accepted}} the argument; he once exclaimed: [...] "Great God in Boots!—the ontological argument is sound!" [...] However, he later criticized the argument, asserting that [...] "the argument does not, {{to a modern}} mind, seem very convincing, but {{it is easier to}} feel convinced that it must be fallacious than it is to find out <b>precisely</b> <b>where</b> the fallacy lies."

A press conference held in Leicester on 24 August announced the start of the work. Archaeologist Richard Buckley admitted the project was a long shot: [...] "We don't know <b>precisely</b> <b>where</b> the church is, let alone where the burial site is."
