An on-site calibration procedure is proposed that calibrates the combined electromechanical model without requiring specific loading conditions on the inner piezoelectric actuators.

40|$|The use {{of metal}} cutting {{operations}} to manufacture shining surfaces, {{is an important}} area of high-precision engineering. Consequently, the machines used in such operations are required to meet increasingly exacting requirements. The effects of non-linearity {{can no longer be}} ignored. In the field of precision turning, vibration problems may occur which cannot be evaluated using standard algorithms. The dynamic displacement between workpiece and tool can contain signal elements with a non-linear character. Until now, the degree of modelling which has taken place on the basis of nonlinear methods and approaches, has been insufficiently high. Non-linear algorithms permitting real-time compensation for dynamic disturbances are, therefore, presented here. A modified <b>Piezo</b> <b>unit</b> will be used, in order to ensure resistance to the high machining forces which can occur in steel-machining operations. Machine tests show that the surface quality can be increased considerably when non-linear algorith ms are applied. The work presented here, is funded by the Volkswagen Foundation and the German Federal Department of Science, Education, Research and Technology (reference Number 13 N 3187) ...|$|E
40|$|High voltage RTM Piezo Driver {{has been}} {{developed}} to support special diagnostic applications foreseen for XFEL facility. The RTM is capable of driving 4 piezo actuators with voltages up to ± 80 V. The solid-state power amplifiers are driven using 18 -bit DACs and sampling rates of 1 MSPS. The bandwidth of the driver is remotely tunable using programmable low pass filters. The 4 -channel <b>Piezo</b> Driver <b>unit</b> provides the information of piezo output voltage and current. Three independent test setups have been built to test 4 -channel Piezo Driver performance. In the paper we are presenting EOD laser lock to 1. 3 GHz FLASH master oscillator using bipolar piezo stretcher (fine tuning). The piezo motor based course tuning has been applied {{for the long term}} laser stability measurements. The unipolar piezo actuator operation has been demonstrated for the Origami Onefive laser locked to 1. 3 GHz LAB MO. The preliminary results of active stabilization of 3 km fiber link laboratory setup are shown...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - For {{the preservation of}} samples (1) by freezing, liquid samples are formed by a droplet generator (10) using a generator unit (12) and a dropper (11), as a pipette or a <b>piezo</b> electric <b>unit</b> or as a bubble jet. The droplets are frozen in a cooling station (20) with a cold zone (21) using a gas or vapor cooling medium (22), until at least the sample surfaces are frozen. The frozen samples are gathered at a collecting station (40) into separate compartments. The sample droplets pass down through the cooling station by gravity. USE - The system is used for freezing biological samples for preservation e. g. cells, cell groups or cell components, for use in biotechnology, medicine and pharmacology. ADVANTAGE - The samples are frozen without damage, for storage and preservation, with selective sorting and individual handling...|$|R
