5000|$|The Ruckus nearly failed {{even before}} it had played a game. Six weeks before the 1995 season, Chase {{experienced}} financial difficulties and failed to post the required $100,000 letter of credit with the league by the March 1 deadline. The league nearly revoked the franchise, but, South African businessman Johnny Imerman quickly stepped in and bought the team. The Ruckus, under former U.S. national team coach Lothar Osiander, began its competitive existence on May 5, 1995 when it defeated the Vancouver Whitecaps {{in the first game}} of the newly renamed A-League. The Ruckus experienced a mid-season loss of form, but the addition of several new players, including Justin Fashanu, led to a resurgence. Atlanta made it to the championship series, only to lose to the Seattle Sounders in three games. After losing nearly $600,000 in 1995 and continuing to lose money in 1996, Imerman arranged for the league to take over team operations in June 1996. [...] In August 1996, Vincent Lu purchased the franchise. In June 1998, the league suspended the team after Lu refused to sign a renewed franchise agreement with the league. [...] The A-League continued to operate the team, now known as the A-League Atlanta. At the time Umbro had a promotional contract with the A-League and it contacted a local Atlanta law firm, Alston & Bird, about the possibility of litigation against the league and Lu. However, this contact resulted in Alston & Bird lawyer John Latham purchasing the team along with his friend Bobby Glustrom. [...] In September 1998, Latham and Glustrom hired Mike Balson as general manager. Balson then hired 1996 USISL Coach of the Year Nuno <b>Piteira</b> as head coach.|$|E
40|$|International audienceNew fluid {{inclusion}} analyses using a {{range of}} analytical techniques including quadropole mass spectrometric analyses coupled with gemmological investigations were conducted on rough and gem-quality faceted emeralds from the <b>Piteiras</b> Mine, Minas Gerais, Brazil. These data complement those of Rondeau et al. (2003) who also presented analyses of the <b>Piteiras</b> emeralds. Emeralds are found typically as euhedral-to-anhedral crystals disseminated in biotite-phlogopite schist and range from 0. 5 to 50 mm long. Emerald mineralization is associated closely with alkaline metasomatized pegmatite bodies, quartz boudin and veins, and talc-chlorite bands. Four types of fluid inclusions are recognized in the emeralds. These include aqueous brine and aqueous carbonic varieties containing one or two liquid phases, along with gas bubbles and/or solid crystals (e. g. carbonates). Primary fluid inclusions in emeralds record salinities of similar to 4 - 24 eq. wt. % NaCl and minimum trapping temperatures from similar to 350 to 480 degrees C. Combined microthermometry, Raman spectroscopy and crush-leach gas analyses indicate that the mineralizing fluid was an aqueous carbonic brine enriched in reduced volatile species such as CH 4, N- 2, H 2 S and alkanes. With respect to their optical properties (RI epsilon = 1. 573 - 1. 580; RI omega = 1. 580 - 1. 588; birefringence = 0. 006 - 0. 008) and specific gravity (2. 65 - 2. 78), the <b>Piteiras</b> emeralds fall within the expected range for metasomatic, schist-hosted emeralds...|$|R

40|$|From {{the work}} of three {{contemporary}} artists; Cristina Ataíde (Viseu, 1951), Susana <b>Piteira</b> (Lisbon, 1963) and Catarina Leitão (Stuttgart, 1970),a study on the drawing of sculptors, as an intrinsic process from sculptural creative act, is elaborated. In terms of methodology, we have chosen the chronological order at {{the presentation of the}} work from the three sculptors, integrating it in the four parts into wich the dissertation is divided, a path that we want from general to particular. The first part deals with the creative process of the sculptor having the drawing as a vehicle between mind and matter. It will be address some theories about the stages of the creative process from the place of subjectivity, of intention, of matter, production and percepcion. Based on several studies on the creation, will be highlighted fot this analysis phases corresponding to the Preparation, Incubation, Ilumination, Evaluation and Development. Authors like Alberto Carneiro (Minho, 1937), Marcel Duchamp (França, 1887 – 1968), José Gil (Mozambique, 1939) and Fayga Ostrower (Poland, 1920 – Brazil, 2001), whose theories are articulated with the creative process, despite their different practices, will be referred. The second part aims to expose how the expression of sculpture and drawing of the three sculptors, gives the body a vital energy that emanates from the inside, something that is always before what is given to see, but artists in question, make visible. In each, from their specific work, can be found specific elements of the language of sculpture, but on these cases, are also drawing, as space, time, scale, portability, shape, volume, line, shadow and texture. The third part focuses the studio as the place of time prior to finalization and exhibition of the works and as a medium between {{the beginning and end of}} each work, such as much of the drawing happens. The three sculptors will cross the spatial context that accompanying them during, before and after the creative process, the house. Inside will be seen sketches, projects, finish or not, materials, and from those, the ordinary matter common to them all, the paper. More specifically, because each of the artists relate differently with the workplace, will appear Cristina Ataíde travel book, the extended ateliê and the artist residency with Susana <b>Piteira</b> and the portable ateliê from Catarina Leitão. The fourth part is the equidistant point where other processes are addressed. The creative process, sculpture, drawing and Artist Book arise as a whole, despite the characteristics underlying the media. The book as an object that opens, closes, expands, or retracts, summarizes narratives and intentions, with the same autonomy of expression that gave rise to it, sculpture and drawing. The closed book appears in {{the work of}} the three artists as a process in which the viewer is unable to open, or, having this hypothesis turns out to be always in a situation where he have to overcome the lock object. Lists from Cristina Ataíde are understood within the concept of Artist Book as the most obvious travel books, clouds books and sketchbooks. Susana <b>Piteira</b> cross stone, paper and lines from a night gown. Catarina Leitão remains closest to the page, but released from it, by an architecture that does not contain but is contained, which makes and breaks itself, as one changes the perspective when walking around a sculpture. Because it is a contemporary subject and existing a certain closeness to sculptors in which the work is based, interviews will be conducted, valuing the testimony of artists, verbalizing ideas that often remain outside the exhibitions and catalogs. The main sources used are the testimonies of the artists themselves, their texts and reflections. In the case of Cristina Ataide, an important feature is the interview conducted by Emilia Ferreira (Lisbon, 1963) concerning the exebithion of Casa da Cerca and from José Gil about several works of the sculptor. In Susana <b>Piteira</b> will be substantial the contribution of the own interview conducted during this work. The Catarina Leitão texts will be the best source for an understanding of her work, for they will also be a constant presence in this dissertation. The texts published in exhibition catalogs of Cristina Ataide, Susana <b>Piteira</b> and Catarina Leitão and from other sculptors working with drawing, will also be an important bibliographical source for this dissertation, like other theses working the theme of drawing and creation. Although the study of drawing has, at present, a crucial importance in the theory of art and in the interdisciplinary, by crossing many of the means used by artists, that does not happen in its relation to sculpture. The way contemporary drawers and sculptors use both languages, in the whole formed by their work, requires a reflexion based mainly on testimonys of the artists themselves about their work processes, which, in a way, enriches this thesis and is presented as testimony of the strong relationship between the two disciplines, merging them into a whole and thus freeing up of an apparent dualit...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In the Itabira-Nova Era Emerald District, {{southeast}} Brazil, gemological emerald {{is extracted}} from underground mines found in schist-type deposits at the contact {{zone of the}} Archean Metavolcanosedimentary Sequence of the Guanhães Complex and Paleoproterozoic anorogenic granites of the Borrachudos Suite. Schist-type deposits are commonly generated by reactions enhanced by deformation and heat during regional metamorphism. The age of the mineralization in the region has {{been a matter of}} debate for decades: Ages ranging from the Archean to the Neoproterozoic are mentioned in the literature. In the mineralized zone from the <b>Piteiras</b> mine fluorine-aluminum-bearing titanite is found in metamafic rocks. The fluorine content was probably derived from the Borrachudos granites and pegmatites like the beryllium for emerald, thus both minerals could have been generated during the same event. U-Pb titanite geochronology via laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) was performed on a thin section of a phlogopite-plagioclase-hornblende schist from the <b>Piteiras</b> mine. The determined age of 576 ± 7 Ma is also the probable age for emerald generation during the Brasiliano cycle, which was the only tectonometamorphic event postdating the intrusion of the granites. This event provided heat and fluids necessary for reactions between the Be- and the Cr-bearing rocks, thus enabling the formation of emeralds...|$|R
