Traditionally within Western thought, biology and technology have been separated into two distinct categories: bios and technê. In 2002, MEART: The Semi-living Artist was created as a collaborative art and science project between SymbioticA at the University of Western Australia in Perth, and the Potter Lab at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, to question the relationship between biology and technology. MEART consisted of rat cortical neurons grown in vitro on an MEA in Atlanta, a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>robot</b> arm capable of drawing with pens on paper in Perth, and software to govern communications between the two. Signals from the neurons were relayed in a closed-loop between Perth and Atlanta as the MEA stimulated the pneumatic arm.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new design {{procedure}} of a fixed-structure robust controller {{for the joint}} space control of a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>robot</b> arm. The proposed technique {{is based on the}} concept of H ∞ loop shaping which is a sensible method for robust controller design. However, in conventional H ∞ loop shaping, the order of the controller is much higher than that of the plant. It is not easy to implement this controller in practical applications. To overcome this problem, in this paper, H ∞ loop shaping control under a structure-specified controller for a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>robot</b> is proposed. The performance and robust stability conditions of the designed system satisfying the H ∞ loop shaping are formulated as the objective function in the optimization problem. Genetic algorithm (GA) is adopted to solve this problem and to achieve the control parameters of the proposed controller. Additionally, in the proposed technique, the performance weighting function, which is normally difficult to obtain, is determined by using GA. The optimal stability margin is used as an objective in GA for selecting the optimal weighting parameters; the requirements in terms of performance specifications are utilized as additional constraints in order to get more practical parameters. The designed controller contains simple structure with lower order and still retains the robustness and performance specification. Simulation results show that the robustness and performance of the proposed controller are almost identical to those of the controller designed by H ∞ loop shaping method. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique. Index Terms—H ∞ loop shaping control, robust control, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>robot,</b> pneumatic actuator. I...|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>robot</b> arm driven by pneumatic actuators as a versatile end effector for material handling systems. The arm {{consists of a}} pneumatic hand and pneumatic wrist. The hand can grasp various objects without force sensors or feedback control. Therefore, this study aims to control the wrist motions to expand the hand motion’s space. The hand mimics the human hand shape and can grasp objects that have different shapes and mechanical characteristics. The wrist has redundant degrees of freedom. This is useful when the robot moves to avoid obstacles. However, the drive mechanism of the wrist has nonlinearity from a mechanical viewpoint. Also, the pneumatic actuators used as the drive source have hysteresis characteristics. These features make the wrist motions difficult to control. Because the wrist is used in material handling systems, its motions need to be freely controlled. Therefore, in this research, experimental models of the drive system of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>robot</b> wrist have been constructed. With the constructed models, the control systems were designed through simulations. After that, we attempted to control the wrist motions with the constructed controllers. As a result, the wrist models are coincident with wrist motions. Finally, experimental results were obtained that match the simulation results...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a finite-input {{receding}} horizon controller (FIRHC) {{is proposed}} as {{motivated by the}} need to use solenoid valves to control the motion of a <b>pneumatic</b> hoping <b>robot.</b> The controller aims to the application on switching control systems in which only a finite number of control inputs are available. The controller utilizes a model to predict system behavior along a finite forward horizon, and establishes an optimization problem, and then finds an optimal control sequence that gives the optimal cost and ultimately only the first element of the sequence is applied at each time step. The stability issue of the controller is discussed as a terminal equality constraint is added. Since only finite discrete inputs exist, the analytical solution is usually not possible to achieve, and exhaustive search was generally the approach to get the optimal control input. As is known, the exhaustive search becomes computationally prohibitive with an increasingly long horizon. An efficient modified depth first search algorithm is proposed, namely, sorted depth first search (sDFS). It preserves the completeness of exhaustive search, while significantly reducing time and space complexity. The whole approach is applied to a <b>pneumatic</b> hopping <b>robot</b> system where the motion control is re-formulated as an explicit energy regulation problem. The control goal is to maintain the system energy at a desired level. An additional example on a three tank control system is used to further illustrate the efficiency of sDFS method on the system with possession of a relatively large amount of modes. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years {{researchers}} have developed prototype robots that are capable of administering physiotherapy, however, these devices tend to be complex and expensive. The use of modem pneumatic servo systems as actuators would make such devices simpler and cheaper. This thesis assesses the feasibility of a pneumatically actuated robotic physiotherapy device through the implementation of force and position control strategies. Traditional pneumatic servo systems consist of a pneumatic cylinder prone to stiction effects and a single spool valve. Here the performance of modem pneumatic servo system, consisting of a low friction pneumatic cylinder and two electropneumatic proportional valves has been evaluated. The increased linearity of the modem pneumatic system enabled a self-tuning pole-placement controller to be implemented that would be unsuitable for conventional pneumatic systems. The selftuning pole-placement controller enabled consistent and accurate position control. Other researchers have achieved force control of pneumatic systems, however their force models are not applicable on this modem configuration. Accurate control of the servo system force output, while the position of the cylinder piston is fixed, has been achieved through an open-loop force controller, however applications for fixed position force control are limited. The servo system force output, during motion, {{has been found to be}} a function of the piston velocity and input control signal. A <b>pneumatic</b> <b>robot</b> has been designed and fabricated with a position workspace that enables the average male to perform upper limb reach and retrieve exercises when attached to the robot. The pneumatically actuated robot, combined with a simple three degree-of-freedom force sensor, form a device capable of administering upper-limb robotic physiotherapy. Impedance control has been identified as the most suitable force and position control strategy for implementing physiotherapy. Applying the impedance control strategy, to a single link of the robot, resulted in accurate implementation of the desired force and position relationship. Extending the controller to two and three degrees of freedom has resulted in degradation of the controller performance due to limitations of the three degree-offreedom force sensor. The controller performance is also found to be dependent upon selection of the impedance characteristics. Low stiffness and high damping, along with high stiffness and high damping have been identified as particular low points in controller performance due to the requirement for the system to provide large forces with little resulting motion. It was concluded that the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>robot</b> and impedance control strategy have the potential to administer physiotherapy. However, further work incorporating a force sensor with greater accuracy that is robust to torque inputs and a rigorous stability analysis would be required before the device could be clinically evaluated...|$|E
