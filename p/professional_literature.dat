2500|$|The term stećak is {{uncommon}} in regional dialects and without etiological value, and semantically incorrect and contradicting as it {{derives from the}} verb [...] "to stand", while the chest-type to which it refers predominantly is laid down, while another sub-type of pillars and crosses is the one predominantly upright; this upright or standing sub-type does not amount even 5% of {{the overall number of}} stećci; in the original stećci inscriptions they are most often called as kami (meaning [...] "stone" [...] regardless of the form), thus some scholars proposed the term kamik (pl. kamici) for all forms of headstones, while stećak would mean only the upright sub-type. The term kamik is more close to the original meaning and sometime is used instead of stećak in <b>professional</b> <b>literature.</b>|$|E

40|$|A feminist content {{analysis}} examines how the popular and health <b>professional</b> <b>literatures</b> discuss infant feeding practises from the 1960 's to 1996. Three research questions were constructed to address women's role(s) and obligations as mothers {{with respect to}} infant feeding. The first research question examined {{the advantages and disadvantages}} associated with particular methods of infant feeding. The second research question examined how (if at all) a woman's time, energy, and bodily fluids are appropriated, and how the development of self-actualisation might be connected to infant feeding practise. The third research question examined how the popular and health <b>professional</b> <b>literatures</b> discussed the various support systems available to the mother in order to analyse {{the way in which the}} mother is situated culturally and socially. The results of the three were theorized and operationalized using the concepts of alienation, appropriation of women, self-actualisation, and diversity. These various concepts were found within socialist and materialist feminism and social psychology...|$|R
2500|$|Application of {{recovery}} models to psychiatric disorders is comparatively recent. The concept {{of recovery}} {{can be traced}} back as far as 1840, when John Perceval, son of one of Britain's prime ministers, wrote of his personal recovery from the psychosis that he experienced from 1830 until 1832, a recovery that he obtained despite the [...] "treatment" [...] he received from the [...] "lunatic" [...] doctors who attended him. But by consensus the main impetus for the development came from the within the consumer/survivor/ex-patient movement, a grassroots self-help and advocacy initiative, particularly within the United States during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The <b>professional</b> <b>literature,</b> starting with the psychiatric rehabilitation movement in particular, began to incorporate the concept from the early 1990s in the United States, followed by New Zealand and more recently across nearly all countries within the [...] "First World". Similar approaches developed around the same time, without necessarily using the term recovery, in Italy, the Netherlands and the UK.|$|E
2500|$|Various ex-gay {{organizations}} have working definitions of change. Prior to disbanding and renouncing {{the idea of}} a cure, Exodus International described change as, [...] "attaining abstinence from homosexual behaviors, lessening of homosexual temptations, strengthening their sense of masculine or feminine identity, correcting distorted styles of relating with members of the same and opposite gender." [...] People Can Change defines change as, [...] "any degree of change toward greater peace, satisfaction and fulfillment, and less shame, depression and darkness", and emphasizes that for most people, heterosexuality is not the ultimate goal. When the term ex-gay was introduced to <b>professional</b> <b>literature</b> in 1980, E. Mansell Pattison defined it as describing a person who had [...] "experienced a basic change in sexual orientation". Some ex-gays advocate entering (or remaining) in a heterosexual marriage as part of the process. Some in mixed-orientation marriages acknowledge that their sexual attractions remain primarily homosexual, but seek to make their marriages work anyway.|$|E
2500|$|Kahn {{was pleased}} with this {{development}} because it allowed him to design the museum with galleries that resembled the ancient Roman vaults he had always admired. [...] The thin, curved shells needed for the roof were challenging to build, however, so Kahn called in a leading authority on concrete construction, August Komendant, {{with whom he had}} worked before (and who, like Kahn, was born in Estonia). [...] Kahn generally referred to the museum's roof form as a vault, but Komendant explained that it was actually a shell playing the role of a beam. [...] More precisely, as professor Steven Fleming points out, the shells that form the gallery roofs are [...] "post-tensioned curved concrete beams, spanning an incredible 100 feet" [...] (30.5 m), which [...] "happened to have been the maximum distance that concrete walls or vaults could be produced without requiring expansion control joints." [...] Both terms, vault and shell, are used in <b>professional</b> <b>literature</b> describing the museum.|$|E

6000|$|It {{would be}} hard to find in Pope such {{compression}} of meaning as in the first, or such penetrative sarcasm as in the second of the passages I have underscored. Dryden's satire is still quoted for its comprehensiveness of application, Pope's rather for the elegance of its finish and the point of its phrase than for any deeper qualities.[82] I do not remember that Dryden ever makes poverty a reproach.[83] He was above it, alike by generosity of birth and mind. Pope is always the parvenu, always giving himself the airs of a fine gentleman, and, like Horace Walpole and Byron, affecting superiority to <b>professional</b> <b>literature.</b> Dryden, like Lessing, was a hack-writer, and was proud, as an honest man has a right to be, of being able to get his bread by his brains. He lived in Grub Street all his life, and never dreamed that where a man of genius lived was not the best quarter of the town.

60|$|What you say of the {{two parts}} in Kidnapped was felt by no one more painfully than by myself. I began it partly as a lark, partly as a pot-boiler; and {{suddenly}} it moved, David and Alan stepped out from the canvas, and I found I was in another world. But there was the cursed beginning, and a cursed end must be appended; and our old friend Byles the butcher was plainly audible tapping at the back door. So it {{had to go into}} the world, one part (as it does seem to me) alive, one part merely galvanised: no work, only an essay. For a man of tentative method, and weak health, and a scarcity of private means, and not too much of that frugality which is the artist's proper virtue, the days of sinecures and patrons look very golden: the days of <b>professional</b> <b>literature</b> very hard. Yet I do not so far deceive myself as to think I should change my character by changing my epoch; the sum of virtue in our books is in a relation of equality to the sum of virtues in ourselves; and my Kidnapped was doomed, while still in the womb and while I was yet in the cradle, to be the thing it is.|$|E
60|$|The {{rewards of}} {{literature}} might be achieved immediately. Such was his idea. But {{he had another}} idea,--perhaps as erroneous,--that this career would not become a gentleman who intended to be Squire of Buston. He had seen two or three men, decidedly Bohemian in their modes of life, to whom he {{did not wish to}} assimilate himself. There was Quaverdale, whom he had known intimately at St. John's, and who was on the Press. Quaverdale had quarrelled absolutely with his father, who was also a clergyman, and having been thrown altogether on his own resources, had come out as a writer for The Coming Hour. He made his five or six hundred a year in a rattling, loose, uncertain sort of fashion, and was,--so thought Harry Annesley,--the dirtiest man of his acquaintance. He did not believe in the six hundred a year, or Quaverdale would certainly have changed his shirt more frequently, and would sometimes have had a new pair of trousers. He was very amusing, very happy, very thoughtless, and as a rule altogether impecunious. Annesley had never known him without the means of getting a good dinner, but those means did not rise to the purchase of a new hat. Putting Quaverdale before him as an example, Annesley could not bring himself to choose literature as a profession. Thinking of all this when he received his mother's letter, he assured himself that Florence would not like <b>professional</b> <b>literature.</b>|$|E

Without this clarity, it is very difficult for users of financial reports to judge if the quality of financial reporting in Australia has improved since the introduction of IFRS, thus undermining a key argument for adoption. 47 page(s...|$|R
