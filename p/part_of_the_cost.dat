5|$|The Blathwayt {{family owned}} the house until 1956, when the {{government}} acquired it, but during the Second World War it was used for child evacuees while rented by Lady Anne Islington, the wife of John Dickson-Poynder, 1st Baron Islington, who redecorated many of the rooms. The National Trust acquired it in 1961. In 2015 major renovation work, costing £3.8 million, included replacing the roof. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> was met from a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of £85,000. While the repairs were in progress, visitors could view the house from a rooftop walkway.|$|E
5|$|In May 1995, several Texas sports teams, {{including}} the Houston Rockets, proposed {{legislation that would}} dedicate state tax revenue to build new arenas. Although the bill was failed in the Texas House of Representatives, Rockets owner Leslie Alexander announced {{he would continue to}} study the possibility of constructing a new arena in downtown Houston, saying the 20-year-old Summit arena was too outdated to be profitable. Although the Summit's management said they could renovate the building for a small <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of a new arena, the Rockets began talks with the city of Houston on a possible location for an arena, They also negotiated with Houston Aeros and Summit owner, Chuck Watson, to release them from their contract with the Summit, which ran until 2003.|$|E
5|$|President Obama {{signed the}} Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) on 23 March 2010. As of 1 August 2011, female {{contraception}} {{was added to}} a list of preventive services covered by the ACA that would be provided without patient co-payment. The federal mandate applied to all new health insurance plans in all states from 1 August 2012. Grandfathered plans did not have to comply unless they changed substantially. To be grandfathered, a group plan must have existed or an individual plan must have been sold before President Obama signed the law; otherwise they were required to comply with the new law. The Guttmacher Institute noted that even before the federal mandate was implemented, twenty-eight states had their own mandates that required health insurance to cover the prescription contraceptives, but the federal mandate innovated by forbidding insurance companies from charging <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> to the patient.|$|E

5|$|Whilst {{working on}} the Midland Railway's main line, Barlow {{established}} that the replacement of sleepers was a larger <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of track maintenance than the replacement of rails because the sleepers decayed more quickly than the rails wore-out and needed renewal more often. To remove the cost of providing and replacing sleepers, he developed and patented his own rail design in 1849. It had a wide flanged profile which could be laid directly on to track ballast {{without the need for}} sleepers, with just periodic tie-bars to maintain the correct gauge. Known as the Barlow rail, it was widely used, especially by the Great Western Railway.|$|E
25|$|In November 1883, Parthia {{made her}} 119th and final {{crossing}} for Cunard. After returning to Liverpool, Parthia was laid up. As part of Cunard's larger plans, Parthia {{was sold to}} John Elder & Co. in 1884 to help cover <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of the new greyhounds Umbria and Etruria along with covering <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> for purchasing the ex-Guion Line greyhound Oregon. With the larger Umbria, Etruria and Oregon fulfilling Cunard's new ambitions, Sir William Pierce MP, the owner of John Elder & Co. had a new future in store for the old Parthia. Pierce planned on transferring the Parthia to his other company, the aforementioned Guion Line, for passenger/livestock service from Glasgow to Canada.|$|E

25|$|The first {{practical}} {{attempt to}} build the canal began in 1799, when an engineer named Ralph Dodd published a pamphlet and began to solicit investment for the scheme. Dodd's plan was for a six-mile canal with locks and basins, taking two years to build and costing £24,576, <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> to be defrayed by selling the excavated chalk as agricultural lime. Dodd was confident that the canal {{would be useful to}} the government but would also attract commercial vessels.|$|E

25|$|The {{scale and}} {{the cost to the}} {{taxpayer}} of the funeral, inaccurately estimated before the event at up to £10million in total, was also criticised by public figures including the Bishop of Grantham, Lord Prescott and George Galloway. Thatcher's family agreed to meet <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of the funeral, unspecified but thought to cover transport, flowers and the cremation. The government would fund the remaining costs, including security. After the event, it was reported by 10 Downing Street that in fact the total public spending on the funeral was £3.6million, of which £3.1million (86 per cent) had been the costs of police and security.|$|E

25|$|Post office murals were {{produced}} from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. The murals {{were intended to}} boost {{the morale of the}} American people from the effects of the Depression by depicting uplifting subjects. The murals were funded as a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of the construction or renovation with 1% of the cost set aside for artistic enhancements. In 1939, artist Harry Sternberg completed the mural, The Family, Industry and Architecture for the towns post office. The artist and his family are the main figures in the painting.|$|E
25|$|Just {{less than}} 9% of the {{population}} purchases individual health care insurance. Insurance payments are a form of cost-sharing and risk management where each individual or their employer pays predictable monthly premiums. This cost-spreading mechanism often picks up much {{of the cost of}} health care, but individuals must often pay up-front a minimum part of the total cost (a deductible), or a small <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of every procedure (a copayment). Private insurance accounts for 35% of total health spending in the United States, by far the largest share among OECD countries. Beside the United States, Canada and France are the two other OECD countries where private insurance represents more than 10% of total health spending.|$|E
25|$|The writer firmly {{believes}} in the theory that interest on capital invested should be charged to the proper expense accounts before ascertaining the actual profit from manufacturing or trading.There is a large difference in risk between capital invested in stocks, bonds and real estate and capital invested in manufacturing or other commercial undertakings; {{and it is not}} to be disputed that capital invested in commercial enterprises is liable to far greater risk than that of capital invested in securities. It is only fair that the capital invested in commercial enterprises should have credit for at least the same return as that in securities before a trading profit is shown.The two articles in the April number of The Journal by Wm. Morse Cole and A. Hamilton Church give such logical reasons for the inclusion of interest as a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost...</b>|$|E

25|$|The ride {{itself is}} fully catered. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are {{provided}} from lunchtime {{on the first}} Saturday until breakfast on the final Sunday as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of the ride. Breakfast and dinner are served from the 'Café de Canvas', with several hundred seats and tables provided both in the open and under a large under-canvas eating and entertainment area.

Riders can also take extra supplies at mealtimes, such as fruit, to carry with them as snacks on the ride. The ride organisers additionally run a licensed café as part of the Café de Canvas, and a separate licensed bar, the 'Spokes Bar', sells alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Portable water and toilet facilities are also provided at each designated rest area.|$|E
25|$|Part A's {{inpatient}} admitted {{hospital and}} skilled nursing coverage is largely funded by revenue from a 2.9% payroll tax levied on employers and workers (each pay 1.45%). Until December 31, 1993, the law provided a {{maximum amount of}} compensation on which the Medicare tax could be imposed each year, {{in the same way}} that the Social Security tax works in the United States. Beginning January 1, 1994, the compensation limit was removed. Self-employed individuals must pay the entire 2.9% tax on self-employed net earnings (because they are both employee and employer), but may deduct half of the tax from the income in calculating income tax. Beginning in 2013, the rate of Part A tax on earned income exceeding US$200,000 for individuals (US$250,000 for married couples filing jointly) rose to 3.8%, in order to pay <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of the subsidies mandated by the PPACA.|$|E
25|$|The cost of {{breathing}} gas containing a high fraction of helium {{is a significant}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of deep diving operations, and can be reduced by recovering the breathing gas for recycling. A reclaim helmet is provided with a return line in the diver's umbilical, and exhaled gas is discharged to this hose through a reclaim regulator, which ensures that gas pressure in the helmet cannot fall below the ambient pressure. The gas is processed at the surface in the helium reclaim system by filtering, scrubbing and boosting into storage cylinders until needed. The oxygen content may be adjusted when appropriate. The same principle is used in built-in breathing systems used to vent oxygen-rich treatment gases from a hyperbaric chamber, though those gases are generally not reclaimed. A diverter valve is provided to allow the diver to manually switch to open circuit if the reclaim valve malfunctions, and an underpressure flood valve allows water to enter the helmet to avoid a squeeze if the reclaim valve fails suddenly, allowing the diver time to switch to open circuit without injury.|$|E
