40|$|The {{morphology}} {{and composition}} of anodically formed alumina films on pure aluminium are well characterised, but their structure is not well known due to the long range order. Two systems have been looked at in this study; {{the nature of the}} structure of tungsten incorporated from tungstate electrolyte during polarisation of aluminium at 100 V, and the other system is the thin passivating layers formed anodically on aluminium surface by polarisation within the range - 2. 2 - + 2. 5 V in aqueous solutions at various pH's. Even though other techniques, such as, electron microscopy and XPS have been used to confirm the presence of anion species in alumina films only EXAFS can yield direct information about the structure of incorporated species. In this study, EXAFS has been used {{for the first time to}} resolve the structure of tungsten incorporated into anodic alumina. Accurate determination of structural parameters require the establishment of reliable phase shift. By fitting the EXAFS of tungsten foil and <b>potassium</b> <b>tungstate,</b> the reliability of the calculated phase shifts for oxygen and tungsten was established. Based on phase shift transferability, the phase shifts calculated for 0 and W were used in the fitting of fluorescence EXAFS of tungsten in alumina oxide films formed on aluminium in tungstate solution at 100 V. The experimental EXAFS function was fitted to a single oxygen shell with four atoms at a distance of 1. 79 ± 0. 01 A. From the structural parameters for incorporated tungsten it is clear that it is in a W 04 2 - even though this can not be the entity which is outwardly mobile. It is suggested that the tungstate may be linked in some way to the alumina and that because aluminium cations are outwardly mobile so tungstate is dragged along. The other kind of anodic films on aluminium are those produced by polarising aluminium in aqueous solutions at various pH's to various voltages within the range - 2. 2 - + 2. 5 V. In some instances, passivating films grow on aluminium causing aluminium protection against corrosion. The structure of these films is not defined and because of their existence on aluminium, and their small thickness, so their structure is not easy to be studied. Electron microscope and XPS techniques have been used to determine their morphology and composition. Some work on indirectly extracting the structure of these films from XPS data was reported and it was claimed that these films have a pseudoboehmite like structure. XPS results of these films reported in this study have confirmed that under open circuit conditions an oxide film forms, but to provide good corrosion protection aluminium is polarised at different potentials. The oxide film which forms in these conditions has been found to have both 4 and 6 coordiation. The Al K-edge EXAFS of these oxide films was fitted in the same way as those for the incorporated tungsten. In this case, the EXAFS of aluminium foil and alpha alumina was fitted by the use of phase shifts calculated in EXCURV 92 for aluminium and oxygen. The oxygen and aluminium phase shifts calculated in EXCURV 92 were reliable, so they were used to fit the EXAFS of the passivating films on aluminium of unknown structure. The EXAFS results in this study have confirmed that these oxides do not have a single phase crystalline structure like boehmite or any others. Their structure is of a short range order and it is characterised in terms of co-ordination number and shell distances. All of the results reported in the EXAFS section of this work indicate that these oxide films are relatively thin and that is indicated by a metallic aluminium signal present most of the time. The sampling depth of the x-ray photons is much greater than the thickness of the oxide film and for this reason a metallic signal was recorded. By comparing the bond length value to the relation between the bond length and co-ordination number, it is obvious that these oxides films have a mixture of 4 and 6 co-ordination. In some cases, like aluminium polarised to + 0. 9 V in pH 10, most of the co-ordination of the oxide is 6 except a little of it in the 4 co-ordination. XANES spectra for the model compounds and those for oxide films on aluminium and their derivative have agreed with the EXAFS results about the structure of thin films formed on aluminium. Also these findings were complemented by the XPS data where the Al 2 p of pseudoboehmite has a binding energy of 80. 0 eV whilst that of the oxide films in general were - 74 eV. So, it is clear that the oxide films structure is not a psuedoboehmite, but it is a local one with different values for the bond length and as a consequence a mixture of different (4 and 6) co-ordination...|$|E
40|$|This {{work has}} focused on {{exploring}} the synthesis and characterization of new alkali oxides and oxynitrides of molybdenum and tungsten. In particular, the synthetic approach via the azide/nitrate route, which was developed recently, should be evaluated and extended to the oxides of the heavy group VI elements. For characterization, the crystal structures have been determined by using X-ray diffraction data by means of single crystal or powder methods, and TGA/DTA, DSC and specific heat measurements, IR/Raman spectroscopy, and measurements of the magnetic and conducting behavior were performed. In general, the following results can be depicted from this work: - The azide/nitrate route has been {{turned out to be}} a very seminal and promising technique for the preparation of oxomolybdates and oxotungstates. - This synthetic method provides an access to oxynitrides of molybdenum and tungsten, besides nitrogen free oxides. Nitrogen does not only serve as a volatile reaction product, but it can also be installed as a part of the solid state product at the applied reaction conditions. - Several modifications of azide-nitrate route have been performed to obtain the desired product in the pure form. - The usual oxidation state adopted by the transition metals involved here is + 6. The oxidation potential of the reaction mixture is strong enough to oxidize molybdenum and tungsten to the highest possible state even when starting with the dioxide or the elemental metal. The following compounds have been discovered and characterized in the course of this work. 1. Na 3 MoO 3 N The new molybdenum oxynitride, Na 3 MoO 3 N, was prepared via the azide route from stoichiometric mixtures of MoO 3 and NaN 3 at 650 °C. Its crystal structure was solved and refined from X-ray powder data (orthorhombic, Pmn 21, a = 7. 2463 (1) Å, b = 6. 2498 (1) Å, c = 5. 6386 (1) Å, Z = 2, Rp: 0. 0904; Rwp: 0. 0983). The structure consists of isolated [MoO 3 N]^ 3 - tetrahedra which are separated by Na^+ cations, also in a tetrahedral co-ordination. It is isostructural to Na 3 WO 3 N which is a lower symmetry derivative of the Cu 3 AsS 4 structure type. Due to the small difference in the scattering lengths of nitrogen and oxygen, it was impossible to decide between the borderline cases of completely ordered or disordered anions or a partial ordering. However, from the positive SHG responses, we can deduce the acentric space group being the correct one and based on the lattice energy calculations, we have been able to identify the position most probably being occupied by nitrogen. 2. Na 5 MoO 4 N The new oxynitride, Na 5 MoO 4 N, was prepared from stoichiometric mixtures of the starting materials MoO 2, Na 2 O 2 and NaN 3 which were heated in a special regime up to 500 °C, and cooled down slowly. Its crystal structure was solved and refined from single crystal data (orthorhombic, Cmcm, a = 9. 911 (2) Å, b = 5. 743 (1) Å, c = 10. 677 (2) Å, Z = 4, R 1 = 0. 0153, wR 2 = 0. 0427). The structure consists of isolated &# 61531;MoO 4 N&# 61533;^ 5 - rectangular pyramids which are separated by Na^+ cations. This compound is structurally related to Na 5 WO 4 N which crystallizes acentrically in space group Cmc 21. 3. K 3 Na(WO 4) 2 The new quaternary tungstate, K 3 Na(WO 4) 2, was synthesized by heating the stoichiometric mixture of the corresponding alkali tungstates, anhydrous sodium tungstate and anhydrous <b>potassium</b> <b>tungstate.</b> The colorless oxide obtained was found to be stable till 1000 °C. K 3 Na(WO 4) 2 is isostructural to the naturally occurring mineral glaserite, K 3 Na(SO 4) 2. Similar to some glaserite type compounds, K 3 Na(WO 4) 2 shows a phase transition which was observed from the HT-X-ray measurements. The room temperature phase was found to be monoclinic (space group: C 2 /c) with the lattice constants: a = 10. 4928 (1) Å, b = 6. 0693 (1) Å, c = 15. 2921 (1) Å, Z = 8 and Beta = 90. 087 (2) ° and, at the temperature above 250 °C, a hexagonal cell of space group P m 1 with a = 6. 1305 (1) Å and c = 7. 6944 (1) Å was observed. The main building units of the crystal structure are WO 4 tetrahedra, which are linked by sodium and potassium cations. The main structural difference between the monoclinic and the trigonal structure is the tilting of the WO 4 tetrahedra and also the coordination of the potassium ions. The coordination number of potassium was found to be 10 and 12 for the HT-phase and, 9 and 10 for the RT-phase. 4. K 6 Mo 10 O 33 The new potassium molybdenum oxide, K 6 Mo 10 O 33, was synthesized by the solid state reaction from the appropriate quantities of the pre-dried metal oxide and potassium molybdate fired at around 650 °C for 2 days. The crystal structure of K 6 Mo 10 O 33 has been solved by using single crystal X-ray diffraction data, the structural refinement was performed by the full-matrix least squares calculation method. The compound adopts the space group P 1 with the lattice constants a = 7. 7100 (5) Å, b = 11. 9659 (8) Å, c = 17. 1321 (1) Å, Z = 2 with Alpha = 86. 42 °,Beta= 77. 18 ° and Gamma= 74. 14 °. The compound is diamagnetic and decomposes at around 950 °C. The structure consists of infinite chains of edge-sharing MoO 6 octahedra which are linked in the second dimension by Mo 4 O 17 groups via common vertices. The structure of this compound is related to Na 6 Mo 10 O 33 and Ag 6 Mo 10 O 33. 5. Cubic Alkali Oxynitrides of Molybdenum, Tungsten and Niobium, A 3 MO 4 -nNn A group of cubic molybdates and tungstates of the formula A 6 M 2 O 9 with A = Na, K, Rb or Cs, M = Mo or W, is known for about 25 years, but the crystal structures have not been solved. After our attempts of syntheses and elemental analyses, it turned out that these compounds contain nitrogen and have to be regarded as oxynitrides. A number of these phases of molybdenum and tungsten and, for comparison, of niobium of the general formula A 3 MO 4 -nNn (A = Na, K, Rb; for n = 1 : M = Mo, W; for n = 0 : M = Nb) were synthesized by using the azide-nitrate/nitrite route, in detail there are - Na 3 MoO 3 N - K 3 MoO 3 N - Rb 3 MoO 3 N - K 3 WO 3 N - K 3 NbO 4. All the compounds are isostructural and crystallize in an F-centered cubic lattice. Single crystals for K 3 MoO 3 N and Na 3 MoO 3 N, were successfully grown. According to crystal structure determinations in space group Fm- 3 m (K 3 MoO 3 N: a = 8. 612 (1) Å, Z = 4, R 1 = 0. 058, wR 2 = 0. 2066), the cations are ordered, but the tetrahedral MoO 3 N anions are rotationally disordered in a way that an octahedral surrounding of the transition metal is pretended. Also different positions of oxygen and nitrogen have not been observed. This phenomenon of rotational disorder remembers to the behavior of other compounds with the general formula A 3 MO 4, e. g. the good ionic conductor Na 3 PO 4 and other phosphates. All the phases obtained here are insulators. The cubic Na 3 MoO 3 N has obviously the same composition as the orthorhombic phase presented in chapter 1. However, no way to transform one phase into the other has been found. The incurring of the cubic Na 3 MoO 3 N is restricted to the presence of another nitrogen-containing compound such as NaNO 3 or (NH 4) 2 Mo 2 O 7 in the reaction mixture besides the presence of azide. In dieser Arbeit wurde besonderes Gewicht auf Synthese und Charakterisierung neuer Alkalioxide und -oxynitride von Molybdän und Wolfram gelegt. Insbesondere der kürzlich entwickelte Ansatz zur Synthese über die Azid-Nitrat-Route sollte untersucht und gegebenenfalls auf die Oxide der schweren Elemente der Gruppe VI angewendet werden. Zur Charakterisierung der erhaltenen, neuen Verbindungen wurden die Kristallstrukturen anhand von Röntgendaten mittels Einkristall- oder Pulvermethoden bestimmt, weiterhin wurden DTA/TG- und DSC-Messungen, Messungen der spezifischen Wärme, IR- und Ramanspektroskopie sowie Messungen der magnetischen Eigenschaften und der Leitfähigkeit durchgeführt. Als allgemeine Ergebnisse dieser Arbeit können folgende Punkte festgehalten werden: - Die Azid-Nitrat-Route hat sich als sehr fruchtbare und vielversprechende Methode zur Präparation von Oxomolybdaten und -wolframaten erwiesen. - Die Synthesemethode bietet, außer zu reinen Oxiden, zusätzlich einen Zugang zu Oxynitriden von Molybdän und Wolfram. Stickstoff übernimmt hier nicht ausschließlich die Rolle eines flüchtigen Reaktionsproduktes, sondern kann unter den herrschenden Reaktionsbedingungen außerdem in den als Feststoff vorliegenden Teil der Produkte eingebaut sein. - Um die gewünschten produkte in Reinform zu erhalten, wurden Modifizierungen der Azid-Nitrat-Route vorgenommen. - Die beteiligten Übergangsmetalle liegen in den Reaktionsprodukten durchweg in der Oxidationsstufe + 6 vor. Das Oxidationspotential der Reaktionsmischung reicht aus, um Molybdän und Wolfram, auch bei Verwendung der Dioxide oder der Metalle als Ausgangsverbindung, in den höchstmöglichen Zustand zu oxidieren. Die nachfolgenden Verbindungen wurden im Rahmen dieser Arbeit erstmals dargestellt und charakterisiert. 1. Na 3 MoO 3 N Natriummolybdänoxynitrid, Na 3 MoO 3 N, wurde über die Azid-Nitrat-Route aus einer Mischung aus MoO 3 und NaN 3 bei 650 °C dargestellt. Die Kristallstruktur wurde aus Röntgenpulverdaten gelöst und verfeinert (orthorhombisch, Pmn 21, a = 7. 2463 (1), b = 6. 2498 (1), c = 5. 6386 (1) Å, Z = 2, Rp = 0. 0904, Rwp = 0. 0983). Die Kristallstruktur besteht aus isolierten [MoO 3 N]^ 3 - -Tetraedern, welche von in ebenfalls tetraedrischer Umgebung befindlichen Na^+ -Kationen separiert werden. Na 3 MoO 3 N ist isostrukturell zu Na 3 WO 3 N, einem niedersymmetrischen Verwandten des Cu 3 AsS 4 -Strukurtyps. Aufgrund der geringen Unterschiede des Streuvermögens von Sauerstoff und Stickstoff läßt sich nicht entscheiden, ob einer der Grenzfälle vollständig ausgeordneter oder vollständig ungeordneter Anionen vorliegt, oder aber eine teilweise Ordnung. Durch Messungen des SHG-Effektes läßt sich jedoch eindeutig auf eine azentrische Raumgruppe schließen, und anhand von Berechnungen der Gitterenergie kann die am wahrscheinlichsten von Stickstoff besetzte Position bestimmt werden. 2. Na 5 MoO 4 N Ein weiteres neues Molybdänoxynitrid, Na 5 MoO 4 N, wurde aus stöchiometrischen Mischungen von MoO 2, Na 2 O 2 und NaN 3 synthetisiert, die nach einem speziellen Temperaturprogramm auf 500 °C erhitzt und anschließend langsam abgekühlt wurden. Die Kristallstruktur wurde anhand von Einkristalldaten gelöst und verfeinert (orthorhombisch, Cmcm, a = 9. 911 (2) Å, b = 5. 743 (1) Å, c = 10. 677 (2) Å, Z = 4, R 1 = 0. 0153, wR 2 = 0. 0427). Die Kristallstruktur setzt sich aus quadratischen [MoO 4 N]^ 5 - -Pyramiden und Na^+ -Kationen zusammen. Die Anionen sind in diesem Fall ausgeordnet, das Stickstoffatom bildet die Spitze der [MoO 4 N]^ 5 - -Pyramide. Die Verbindung ist nahe verwandt mit Na 5 WO 4 N, das azentrisch in der Raumgruppe Cmc 21 kristallisiert. 3. K 3 Na(WO 4) 2 Ein neues quaternäres Wolframat, K 3 Na(WO 4) 2, wurde durch Erhitzen stöchiometrischer Mischungen der entsprechenden entwässerten ternären Alkaliwolframate, Na 2 WO 4 und K 2 WO 4, dargestellt. Das erhaltene farblose Oxid ist bis 1000 °C stabil. K 3 Na(WO 4) 2 ist isostrukturell zum natürlich vorkommenden Mineral Glaserit, K 3 NaSO 4. Wie einige weitere, im Glaserittyp kristallisierende Verbindungen durchläuft K 3 Na(WO 4) 2 einen Phasenübergang, der bei HT-Röntgenbeugungsmessungen beobachtet werden konnte. Die Raumtemperaturmodifikation kristallisiert monoklin mit a = 10. 4928 (1) Å, b = 6. 0693 (1) Å, c = 15. 2921 (1) Å, Z = 8 und Beta = 90. 087 (2) °, bei 250 °C wird ein hexagonales Gitter mit a = 6. 1305 (1) und c = 7. 6944 (1) Å beobachtet. Die wichtigsten Baugruppen der Kristallstruktur sind WO 4 -Tetraeder, die durch Kalium- und Natriumkationen verbunden werden. Der Hauptunterschied zwischen der monoklinen und der hexagonalen Phase besteht in der Neigung der WO 4 -Tetraeder sowie in der Umgebung der Kaliumionen. Die Koordinationszahl von Kalium ist 10 und 12 in der HT- bzw. 9 und 10 in der RT-Phase. 4. K 6 Mo 10 O 33 K 6 Mo 10 O 33 wurde aus geeigneten Mengen des vorgetrockneten Molybdänoxids und Kaliummolybdats durch zweitägiges Erhitzen bei 650 °C präpariert. Die Kristallstruktur von K 6 Mo 10 O 33 wurde anhand von Einkristalldaten unter Verwendung des Verfahrens der kleinsten Fehlerquadrate bestimmt (P 1, a = 7. 7100 (5), b = 11. 9659 (8), c = 17. 1321 (1) Å, Z = 2, Alpha = 86. 42 °, Beta = 77. 18 °, Gamma = 74. 14 °). Die Verbindung ist diamagnetisch und zersetzt sich bei ungefähr 950 °C. Die Kristallstruktur wird aus unendlichen Ketten von kantenverknüpften MoO 6 -Oktaedern gebildet, die von Mo 4 O 17 -Einheiten über gemeinsame Ecken zu Schichten verbunden werden. Die Struktur weist Ähnlichkeiten zu denen von Na 6 Mo 10 O 33 und Ag 6 Mo 10 O 33 auf. 5. Kubische Alkalioxynitride von Molybdän, Wolfram und Niob, A 3 MO 4 -nNn Eine Reihe kubischer Molybdate und Wolframnate der Zusammensetzung A 6 M 2 O 9 mit A = Na, K, Rb or Cs, M = Mo, W, ist seit etwa 25 Jahren bekannt, allerdings gelang es bisher nicht, deren Kristallstrukturen zu bestimmen. Nach unseren Syntheseversuchen und nach Elementaranalysen stellte sich heraus, daß diese Verbindungen Stickstoff enthalten und daher als Oxynitride angesehen werden müssen. Einige dieser molybdän-, wolfram- und, zum Vergleich, niobhaltigen Phasen der allgemeinen Zusammensetzung A 3 MO 4 -nNn (A = Na, K, Rb; für n = 1 : M = Mo, W; für n = 0 : M = Nb) wurden über die Azid-Nitrat/Nitrit-Route dargestellt, im einzelnen sind dies - Na 3 MoO 3 N - K 3 MoO 3 N - Rb 3 MoO 3 N - K 3 WO 3 N - K 3 NbO 4. Sämtliche Verbindungen sind isostrukturell und kristallisieren kubisch flächenzentriert. Von K 3 MoO 3 N and Na 3 MoO 3 N gelang die Zucht von Einkristallen, anhand derer die Kristallstruktur bestimmt werden konnte (K 3 MoO 3 N: Fm- 3 m, a = 8. 612 (1) Å, Z = 4, R 1 = 0. 058, wR 2 = 0. 2066) Während die Kationen ausgeordnet sind, können die Anionen nicht unterschiedlichen Positionen zugeordnet werden und sind fehlgeordnet. Zudem sind die [MoO 3 N] 3 -Anionen auf solche Weise rotationsfehlgeordnet, daß eine oktaedrische Umgebung des Übergangsmetallatoms vorgetäuscht wird. Das Auftreten von Rotationsfehlordnung tetraedrischer Baugruppen erinnert stark an das ähnlicher Verbindungen der allgemeinen Formel A 3 MO 4, darunter der gute Ionenleiter Na 3 PO 4 sowie weitere Phosphate. Alle hier erhaltenen Phasen sind Isolatoren. Das hier erwähnte kubische Na 3 MoO 3 N hat die gleiche Zusammensetzung wie die orthorhombische Phase, die in Kapitel 1 dieser Arbeit vorgestellt wurde. Allerdings wurde keine Möglichkeit gefunden, die beiden Modifikationen ineinander zu überführen. Der Erhalt des kubischen Na 3 MoO 3 N ist an die Anwesenheit einer weiteren stickstoffhaltigen Komponente in der Reaktionsmischung neben dem Azid, d. h. NaNO 3 oder (NH 4) 2 Mo 2 O 7, gebunden...|$|E

The scope of {{the research}} work includes the investigation of spectroscopic and optical gain properties in epitaxy layers with concentration of trivalent ytterbium (Yb 3 +) up to 76 at. %, which is equivalent to Yb 3 + density of ~ 5 × 1021 cm- 3. Spectroscopic properties of the high ytterbium concentration epitaxy layers, such as luminescence lifetime, transition cross-sections, and their temperature dependence, are examined carefully and in detail. A novel confocal measurement setup is proposed to mitigate the radiation trapping effect which elongates the measured lifetime. It is confirmed that concentration dependent lifetime quenching on high Yb 3 + concentration <b>potassium</b> double <b>tungstate</b> epitaxial layers is rather weak. Further analysis on the power dependent luminescence decay curves reveals the presence of energy transfer upconversion (ETU) process. The cross-section spectra of the high ytterbium concentration <b>potassium</b> double <b>tungstate</b> epitaxy layers {{are similar to those}} of bulk crystals. It is observed that the cross-section spectra change drastically with the increase of temperature due to two reasons: the fractional population at the starting Stark level and the linewidth of the respective transition at the given temperature. The material gain in thin film configuration are investigated via experimental and numerical approaches. Net gain value of 2. 62 dB (817 dB/cm) is achieved in 32 μm thick epitaxial layer without any thermal management using pump wavelength of 932 nm and signal wavelength of 981 nm. In overall, the work described in this thesis provide advances in understanding the characteristics of high Yb 3 + concentration <b>potassium</b> double <b>tungstate</b> waveguide layers. The experimental results show that favorable spectroscopic properties are retained in the epitaxial layers. Nevertheless, additional effects such as ETU process, quenched ions, and localized heating within the pumped region have also been discovered and analyzed. Particularly, elevated temperature on the gain medium would severely affect the absorption and emission behavior. The investigation of optical gain and luminescence spectra shows that the thermal effects play a role in high active ion concentration and intensely pumped amplifier...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concentrates}} on improving {{the performance of}} low-index-contrast waveguides in terms of reducing the bend losses and increasing the index contrast of waveguides by heterogeneous adhesive bonding and thinning. In {{the first part of}} this thesis, we have demonstrated that introducing a thin metallic layer underneath a tight bent polymer waveguide considerably reduces the bend losses, especially for transverse-electric polarization. For proof-of-concept demonstration, the proposed design is implemented on optical waveguides made of epoxy-based negative photoresist, SU- 8. Alternatively, the same concept can be applied to various optical waveguide platforms that suffer from high bend losses due to a low refractive index contrast between core and cladding. The wavelength of interest in this study is 1. 55 µm. The numerical study carried out in this work indicates that the introduction of a thin gold layer underneath the polymer channel blocks the radiation of the mode and pushes the confined mode back towards the core. The numerical studies and experimental realizations of such low-loss SU- 8 based sharp bent waveguides, including fabrication and characterization, is covered in detail in the thesis. The second optical architecture is the on-chip, small-footprint high-index-contrast undoped/doped <b>potassium</b> double <b>tungstate,</b> KY(WO 4) 2, waveguides enabled by a novel fabrication technique. Up until now, the fabrication of rare-earth ion doped optical devices in <b>potassium</b> double <b>tungstate</b> material are based on growing a doped layer by liquid phase epitaxy on a bulk undoped KY(WO 4) 2 substrate. The resulting waveguide architecture has a low index contrast between the active layer and the undoped substrate, which leads to large dimensional cross-sections and a large pump power requirement to fully invert the amplifier core. In this thesis, a heterogeneous integration technique was proposed for the development of high-index-contrast waveguides amplifiers that can be potentially integrated on passive integration platforms. A novel fabrication procedures based on heterogeneous adhesive bonding and thinning is realized.
