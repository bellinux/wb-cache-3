Within the Weber Delta area there has existed a continual decline in the <b>piezometric</b> <b>surface</b> of the deep confined aquifer over the last 40 years. This decline ranges from approximately 20 feet along {{the eastern shore of}} the Great Salt Lake to 50 feet along in the vicinity of Hill Air Force Base. Declines in the <b>piezometric</b> <b>surface</b> are undesirable because of the increased well installation costs, increased pumping costs, decreased aquifer storage, increased risk of salt water intrusion, and the possibility of land subsidence. Declines in the <b>piezometric</b> <b>surface</b> can be prevented or reduced by utilizing artificial groundwater recharge. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop and operate a basin groundwater model with stochastic recharge inputs to determine the feasibility of utilizing available Weber River water for the improvement of the groundwater availability. This was accomplished by preparing auxiliary computer models which generated statistically similar river flows from which river water rights were subtracted. The feasibility of utilizing this type of recharge input was examined by comparing the economic benefit gained by reducing area wide pumping lifts through artificial recharge with the costs of the recharge operations. Institutions for implementing a recharge program were examined. Through this process a greater understanding of the geohydrologic conditions of the area was obtained. <b>Piezometric</b> <b>surface</b> contour maps, geologic profiles, calibrated values for geologic and hydrologic variables, as well as system response to change were quantified...|$|E

40|$|Prediction of <b>piezometric</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{and drain}} spacing for {{horizontal}} drain design Abstract Horizontal drains, used independently or {{as part of}} a more complex remediation scheme, are frequently installed to mitigate the effects of increased groundwater in slope stabilization projects. Due to a general trial and error approach to their design, the need for improved design practices has been recognized. The procedures established by Crenshaw and Santi in 2004 made some advances in this direction, but did not account for slopes with drains that were not horizontal or for sloping low-permeability layers underneath the slide mass. Furthermore, the method out-lined by Crenshaw and Santi is time-consuming and requires some trial and error calculations to achieve convergence. Therefore, the method has been modified to account for nonhorizontal elements, and a horizontal drain spreadsheet has been developed to stream-line the design for projects where horizontal drains will be in-stalled. The horizontal drain spreadsheet may be used to: (1) predict a conservative piezometric profile in a drained slope for use in slope stability analyses, (2) predict piezometric heads in any single piezometer in a drainage field, and (3) predict drain spacing for design purposes. This document explains the revisions to Crenshaw and Santi’s procedures and provides instructions for applying the method. The instructions may be used for hand calculations, but are specifically intended for use with the hori-zontal drain spreadsheet.

Velocity analysis of CMP and VRP surveys provided a four-layered velocity model. This model was verified by comparison between the depths of englacial reflectors and water channels seen in borehole video, and {{from the depths of}} boreholes drilled to the bed. In the absence of sediment within the glacier ice, radar velocity is inversely proportional to water content. Using mixture models developed by Paren and Looyenga, the variation of water content with depth was determined from the radar velocity profile. At the glacier surface the calculated water content is 0. 23 − 0. 34 % (velocity 0. 166 m ns− 1), which rises sharply to 3. 0 − 4. 1 % (velocity 0. 149 m ns− 1) at 28 m depth, interpreted to be the level of the <b>piezometric</b> <b>surface.</b> Below the <b>piezometric</b> <b>surface</b> the water content drops slowly to 2. 4 − 3. 3 % (velocity 0. 152 m ns− 1) until ∼ 102 m depth where it falls to 0. 09 − 0. 14 % (velocity 0. 167 m ns− 1).

40|$|Management of {{groundwater}} systems requires realistic conceptual hydrogeological models {{as a framework}} for numerical simulation modelling, but also for system understanding and communicating this to stakeholders and the broader community. To help overcome these challenges we developed GVS (Groundwater Visualisation System), a stand-alone desktop software package that uses interactive 3 D visualisation and animation techniques. The goal was a user-friendly groundwater management tool that could support a range of existing real-world and pre-processed data, both surface and subsurface, including geology and various types of temporal hydrological information. GVS allows these data to be integrated into a single conceptual hydrogeological model. In addition, 3 D geological models produced externally using other software packages, can readily be imported into GVS models, as can outputs of simulations (e. g. <b>piezometric</b> <b>surfaces)</b> produced by software such as MODFLOW or FEFLOW. Boreholes can be integrated, showing any down-hole data and properties, including screen information, intersected geology, water level data and water chemistry. Animation is used to display spatial and temporal changes, with time-series data such as rainfall, standing water levels and electrical conductivity, displaying dynamic processes. Time and space variations can be presented using a range of contouring and colour mapping techniques, in addition to interactive plots of time-series parameters. Other types of data, for example, demographics and cultural information, can also be readily incorporated. The GVS software can execute on a standard Windows or Linux-based PC with a minimum of 2 GB RAM, and the model output is easy and inexpensive to distribute, by download or via USB/DVD/CD. Example models are described here for three groundwater systems in Queensland, northeastern Australia: two unconfined alluvial groundwater systems with intensive irrigation, the Lockyer Valley and the upper Condamine Valley, and the Surat Basin, a large sedimentary basin of confined artesian aquifers. This latter example required more detail in the hydrostratigraphy, correlation of formations with drillholes and visualisation of simulation <b>piezometric</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Both alluvial system GVS models were developed during drought conditions to support government strategies to implement groundwater management. The Surat Basin model was industry sponsored research, for coal seam gas groundwater management and community information and consultation. The “virtual” groundwater systems in these 3 D GVS models can be interactively interrogated by standard functions, plus production of 2 D cross-sections, data selection from the 3 D scene, rear end database and plot displays. A unique feature is that GVS allows investigation of time-series data across different display modes, both 2 D and 3 D. GVS has been used successfully as a tool to enhance community/stakeholder understanding and knowledge {{of groundwater}} systems and is of value for training and educational purposes. Projects completed confirm that GVS provides a powerful support to management and decision making, and as a tool for interpretation of groundwater system hydrological processes. A highly effective visualisation output is the production of short videos (e. g. 2 – 5 min) based on sequences of camera ‘fly-throughs’ and screen images. Further work involves developing support for multi-screen displays and touch-screen technologies, distributed rendering, gestural interaction systems.

40|$|A patterned, partially-treed, fen in the mid-boreal {{region of}} central Saskatchewan {{was the site}} of renewed {{hydrological}} research from 2002 to 2004. Hydraulic conductivity, transmissivity, and storativity were determined through use of a surface loading test, pumping tests, and an enclosed field drainage test. None of these field tests have been previously described in the literature as having been used in peat environments. The combined results of field and laboratory drainage tests were used to obtain a general storativity with water table depth relationship in the upper peat layer. The hydraulic conductivity, measured with slug tests, the loading test, and pumping tests, is high near the surface, declining greatly with depth. These previously untested field methods have the advantage of representing volumes of peat from tenths of a meter to cubic meters. Characterization of the hydrology of the peatland involved year round observations of water table, <b>piezometric</b> head, peat <b>surface</b> elevations, frost depth and peat temperatures. Fluctuations of the water table, and soil moisture changes produce changes in effective stress that lead to volume change in the highly compressible peat. This is particularly important for sites with thick peat deposits. Independent compressibility estimates were as high as 10 - 5 N/m 2 in the upper peat. At three fen sites, changes in peat thickness were estimated from monthly estimates of effective stress change, using year round hydrological observations, and compared to measured annual peat thickness changes.

40|$|Bibliography: pages [86]- 91. The {{long-term}} hydrogeologic {{effects of}} underground mining and mine-induced fracturing and subsidence were {{studied at the}} town of Muddy, in Saline County, Illinois. Muddy is underlain by two mines, operated by the Sahara Coal Company, which from 1904 to 1940 mined the Harrisburg # 5 Coal of the Pennsylvanian Carbondale Formation, at depths of 300 and 400 feet. The Pennsylvanian rocks include several minor sandstone aquifers and are overlain by glacial lake deposits (sand, silt, clay), some water-bearing. The Cottage Grove Fault (throw: 110 feet) separates the mines. It is generally thought that the strata fracturing associated with roof collapse, bed sagging and land subsidence can increase permeability and create interaquifer connections. In this study, subsidence features were located and water levels in wells were measured in 1985 - 1986. Although the water table, like the topography, is almost flat, the bedrock <b>piezometric</b> <b>surface</b> shows anomalies due to the mine (e. g., lows coincident with subsidence features). Possibly, mine-induced fractures connected aquifers and allowed ground- water to enter the mine conduit. However, transmissivities estimated from pumping tests (65 - 165 ft²/day for glacial wells and 110 - 548 ft day for bedrock wells) showed no relation to subsidence features. It is suggested that the mine is absorbing the regional upward discharge of groundwater, creating a depression in the <b>piezometric</b> <b>surface.</b> Mixing zones between glacial and bedrock aquifers were seen to occur as leakage occurred through mine-induced fractures and through leaky well casings. Water samples were analyzed for major ions. They show the glacial wells to have no dominant ion, but the Pennsylvanian bedrock wells {{to be dominated by}} Na+ and HC 0 g~. This is thought to be indirect evidence for the upwelling of mineralized water. Mixing is shown to occur between glacial and bedrock wells in relation to mine-induced fracturing and subsidence. Though little studied, the hydrogeological impacts of the abandoned underground mines in the Illinois Basin have considerable significance for the movement of naturally poor quality and contaminated groundwaters and for resources in the rural communities.

40|$|Industrialization in {{the eastern}} part of the Catania plain has caused an {{intensive}} exploitation of groundwater, with negative consequences on its hydrodynamic equilibrium and water quality degradation. Lithological characteristics from boreholes and resistivity data have permitted the reconstruction of the geometrical relations within the deposit and its thickness varations.

Less frequently it corresponds to a breakdown of karst void ceiling (i. e. collapse sinkhole). This hazard can cause significant engineering challenges. Therefore decision-makers require the elaboration of methodologies for reliable predictions of such hazards (e. g., karst subsidence susceptibility and hazards maps, early-warning monitoring systems). A methodological framework was developed to evaluate relevant conditioning factors favouring subsidence (Perrin et al. submitted) and then to combine these factors to produce karst subsidence susceptibility maps. This approach was applied to a mantled karst area south of Paris (Val d'Orléans). Results show the significant roles of the overburden lithology (presence/absence of low-permeability layer) and of the karst aquifer <b>piezometric</b> <b>surface</b> position within the overburden. In parallel, an experimental site has been setup to improve the understanding of key processes leading to subsidence/collapse and includes piezometers for measurements of water levels and physico-chemical parameters in both the alluvial and karst aquifers as well as surface deformation monitoring. Results should help in designing monitoring systems to anticipate occurrence of subsidence/collaps...|$|E
40|$|As human {{population}} increases, demand for water supplies will cause {{an increase in}} pumping rates from confined aquifers which may become unconfined after long-term pumping. Such an unconfined-confined conversion problem has not been fully investigated before and {{is the focus of}} this thesis. The objective of this thesis is to use both analytical and numerical modeling to investigate groundwater flow in an unconfined-confined aquifer including the no-flow lateral boundary effect and the regional flow influence. This study has used Girinskii?s Potential in combination with MATLAB to depict how changes in aquifer dimensions, hydraulic properties, regional flow rates, and pumping rates affect {{the size and shape of}} the unconfined-confined boundary. This study finds that the unconfined-confined conversion is quite sensitive to the distance between the <b>piezometric</b> <b>surface</b> and the upper confining bed when that distance is small, and the sensitivity lessens as that distance increases. The study shows that pumping rate is the dominating factor for controlling the size of the unconfined-confined boundary in comparison to the regional flow. It also shows that the presence of a no-flow boundary alters the normally elliptical shape of the unconfined-confined boundary...|$|E
40|$|The chronological {{evolution}} of the <b>piezometric</b> <b>surface</b> of the Saïss basin shallow aquifer is completed by observing its fluctuation at several piezometers. This evolution puts in evidence the continued decline of groundwater level. This decrease {{is due to the}} combined effects of reduced water supplies (precipitation) which has reduced the natural recharge of groundwater, and increased pumping intended primarily for irrigation. This situation generates an imbalance between the exploitation of the shallow water and its recharge. The drawdown of groundwater level has affected the flow of some sources issued from this aquifer such as the source of Ain Amer (X = 536. 68, Y = 377. 7) where this decline is very pronounced; from 90 l/s in 1984, a few l/s in 1997 to almost dry today. The diagnostic of the vulnerability to pollution of this shallow aquifer, according to DRASTIC method, reveals that this vulnerability is present with different degrees. The highest degree has been observed in the Northern zone of the aquifer, which corresponds to the urban area of the Fez city. This vulnerability is facilitated by the shallowness of the aquifer in this area and also by the permeability of formations hosting the studied aquifer...|$|E
40|$|Stream-aquifer {{interaction}} due to groundwater extraction {{has been}} analyized. Streamflow depletion in alluvial plain area at Sonhuajiang river valley, China, {{can be determined}} {{as a result of}} groundwater withdrawal. Three - dimensional transient numerical model technique based on hydrologic and hydrogeologic parameters was used to understand and quantify stream-aquifer interaction. Numerical model was setup based on the constructed conceptual model of the study area. The alluvial aquifer is shown to be of high transmissivity with the pumping stresses having a larger radius of influence, impacting both the aquifer water levels and the streamflow in the nearby Songhuajiang River, Jilin Province, China. Drawdown and recharge boundary effects were observed in all observation wells in the area. The alluvial aquifer exhibited a <b>piezometric</b> <b>surface</b> behavior and responded as semi-confined aquifer. A semi-confining clay layer less than 3 m thick and an additional recharge source from a nearby stream-alluvial system were the probable causes of the observed phenomena. Induced infiltration, reduced baseflow, river gaining, river losing, and the effect of riverbed conductance on river leakage were performed using visual MODFLOW model in the lower reach of the Songhuajiang River valley...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} wells {{penetrating}} the Floridan aquifer in eastern Clay County {{were found to}} be losing water to permeable zones above this aquifer. A differential in artesian pressure was observed in closely spaced wells of similar depth. Further investigation. revealed that the pressure differential in the wells was due to the design of the wells, of which there were four principal types. A comparison of the four types of wells in relation to the subsurface geology showed that three types of wells were open to the permeable zones above the Floridan aquifer. In such wells water of relatively high head from the Floridan aquifer moves up through the well bore and out into zones of relatively low head. The estimated water loss from poorly designed wells ranged from 32 to 180 gpm (gallons per minute). The artesian head loss in leaky wells ranged from 3 to 15 feet. A total loss of water of 39 mgd (million gallons per day) was estimated from all the leaky wells in the area. A significant decline of the <b>piezometric</b> <b>surface</b> of the Floridan aquifer was observed in eastern Clay County. Some of this decline {{can be attributed to the}} loss of water from the Floridan aquifer through these poorly designed wells. (Document has 16 pages. ...|$|E
40|$|The prime {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to identify and map the water-logged areas within Moyna basin, India, and to explore their contemporary economic significances. The Landsat 5 TM, ASTER data, and topographical sheets have been taken into consideration with field observations. Maps on relief, slope, canal density, embankments, a supervised classification of the study area and then NDVI, NDWI, and modified NDWI or NDMI have been prepared here. At Moyna, the <b>piezometric</b> <b>surface</b> ranges from five to ten metres below the ground level. The percentage of clay particles is high throughout the surface soil. The total rainfall is nearly 1400 [*]mm and most of it happened during the monsoon period. Two well-marked depressions are observed there within the basin and the nearly central one is wide and is clearly identified from the relief map also. Problem of drainage congestion there accelerates the onset of water-logged situation. In general, water-logged areas are not suitable for humans. People once were worried about the water-logged environment due to underwater scenario of low-lying agricultural fields for a certain period, but today local people are taking this environmental condition as an opportunity for fishing activity and thus they are becoming economically benefitted as well...|$|E
40|$|THE {{long-term}} {{availability of}} adequate groundwater for sustainable irrigated agricultural production {{can be assured}} by causing the evolution and maintenance of an appropriate potentiometric (<b>piezometric)</b> <b>surface</b> in utilized aquifers. By providing adequate saturated thickness and hydraulic gradients and heads. such a surface affords some protection {{from the effects of}} drought. economic: hardship, and environmental or legal complications. Procedures for determining desirable or optimal regional steady-state groundwater potentiometric surfaces have been reported by several researchers. An existing polcmiometric surface can be forced to evolve into a desirable 2 ̆ 7 target 2 ̆ 7 surface if it is subjected through time to the proper combination of recharges and discharges. Depending on the difference between initial and target surfaces, steady pumping strategies may require extended periods to complete the evolutionary process. The evolutionary period may be significantly shortened by using a time-varying pumping strategy. Such a strategy may be calculated by combining goal programming and simulation. The presented technique maximizes attainment of target potentiometric surface elevations within a predetermined planning period. It is a valuable tool for a management agency that is seeking to determine how to most rapidly achieve desirable groundwater conditions in either an undeveloped region or a region that has an existing pattern of groundwater pumping...|$|E
