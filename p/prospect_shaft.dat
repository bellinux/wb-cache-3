50|$|The west {{shore of}} the island {{was the site of}} {{exploratory}} uranium mining. The site was originally staked and surveyed by Eldorado Mining and Refining between 1946 and 1947 (referred to as BEAVER Claim No. 4). In 1953 the claim was purchased by Meta Uranium Mines Ltd and in 1954 a <b>prospect</b> <b>shaft</b> to a depth of 115 m was constructed. Mining operations were suspended in November 1955, however remnants of the mine site still remain on the island.|$|E
50|$|When {{gold was}} found drift mining began. Miners would tunnel {{horizontally}} {{from the bottom}} of their <b>prospect</b> <b>shaft</b> to follow the gold along the surface of the bedrock. The tunnels did not cave in because the ground was frozen. Miners discovered old underground beach and river gravels rich with gold. Around 1900 the population of Nome was more than twenty thousand, many of them drift miners. Nome's gold fields, appearing untouched from the surface, are honeycombed with tunnels left by the gold rush drift miners. Today's miners, prospecting with modern drilling equipment, sometimes hit old drifts; this was, and is, a technique copied from the Welsh coal miners of south Wales and is much more effective than using bell pits.|$|E
50|$|In 1906-1907 copper {{averaged}} £87 a ton on the London market, {{the highest}} price for thirty years, and the Cloncurry field grew. The Great Northern railway was extended west of Richmond in 1905-1906 by the Queensland Government and mines were floated on the Melbourne Stock Exchange. At Mount Elliott a <b>prospecting</b> <b>shaft</b> had been sunk and on 1 August 1906 a Cornish boiler and winding plant were installed on the site.|$|R
50|$|In 1937 {{the north}} {{workings}} were prospected and broken stopes retimbered; 29 tons of wolfram and 81 tons of tin were obtained. In the spa lode behind the boiler shed a winze and shaft were sunk for 10 tons of good ore in 1938. A new shaft to 15 m {{on the eastern}} lode in 1940 and <b>prospecting</b> <b>shafts</b> were put in; 215 tons of old dumps were treated for 2.6 tons of concentrates. £961 tons of tin were obtained in 1942.|$|R
50|$|Coal {{was found}} in the Ellisras Basin in 1920, but for many years little was done to explore the resource.

25|$|It is {{not known}} when the Golden Gate No.10 mine on the {{northern}} edge of the Golden Gate reef commenced operations, but it is marked on Rands' 1896 map. At the northern end of the line of reef, at varying distances from Golden Gate Creek, a number of <b>prospecting</b> <b>shafts</b> were sunk to try and find a continuation of the reef, which had proved so productive further south. No.10 North was at the northern end of the field and here the reef became well defined, although there was a convergence of faults. Mining operations were conducted on a large scale in exploring the reef up to 1906.|$|R
40|$|Izat-kuli {{is located}} 21 km to the {{southwest}} of the modern settlement Madau (Kizyl-Etrek region, Turkmenistan). Izat-kuli settlement is limited from all sides by banks of ancient canals, beyond which is takyr. In the <b>prospecting</b> <b>shaft</b> number 1, nine stratigraphical horizons, two building periods and three periods of occupation are revealed. The thickness of cultural layers measures up 8, 75 m. Pottery assemblages of the 1 st and 2 nd occupation periods of Izat-kuli should be referred to the Early Iron Age I of Iran, i. e. 1300 / 1250 - 1000 B. C. since the vessels of these complexes find parallels in the Sumbar culture, Sialk A, Kaitariya, Khurvin, Marlik-tepe. The 3 rd occupation period’s ceramic assemblage of Izat-kuli finds direct analogies in the complexes of Early Iron Age II of Iran – Sialk B, Tyureng-tepe dated from 1000 - 800 / 750 B. C. In the <b>prospecting</b> <b>shaft</b> number 2, which thickness of archaeological layers is 3 m, building remains are not found. The <b>prospecting</b> <b>shaft</b> number 3 archaeological layers’ thickness reaches 4, 95 m. In its upper layers there is revealed a building period applying to the top building horizon of settlement which corresponds to the excavated living and economic complexes. The received results of stratigraphical explorations allow to judge dynamics of development of Izat-kuli settlement and its long existence. Stratigraphical researches on Madaudepe, the settlements of Benguvan oasis, Tilkidepe, Chyglykdepe, Tangsikylja, Izat-kuli have established that the archaeological layers containing pottery of Archaic Dakhistan culture lay directly on the ancient delta deposits of Sumbar and Atrek rivers. No saline delta deposits were apparently an ancient surface on which people settled {{down at the end}} of the II millennium B. C. A dense irrigation system promoted development of agriculture. On the investigated plain there is a large massif of the ancient irrigated lands testifying to the high level of development of the ancient farming cultureИзат-кули находится в 21 км к юго-западу от современного селения Мадау (Кизыл-Этрекский район, Туркменистан). Для определения динамики роста поселения Изат-кули было заложено три стратиграфических шурфа - № 1, № 2 и № 3. Во всех трёх шурфах на материковом слое (речной аллювий) лежат культурные слои, относящиеся к культуре архаического Дахистана и свидетельствующие о единовременности заселения поселения Изат-кули. Керамических комплексы I и II периодов обживания Изат-кули следует относить к ЖВ I Ирана, т. е. 1300 / 1250 – 1000 гг. до н. э.

50|$|Diamonds {{were first}} {{discovered}} on the Koffiefontein farm in 1870. Mining {{started in the}} form of small claims that were later amalgamated into Koffiefontein Mine Limited. De Beers acquired control of Koffiefontein Mine Limited in 1911. Mining operations were then continuous until the advent of the Great Depression in 1932 when work was suspended. Between 1950 and 1953, a <b>prospecting</b> <b>shaft</b> was sunk which was followed by limited production. The mine was reopened in 1970 and preparations for increased production were completed in August 1971. Immediately after completing the preparations, production from the open pit commenced and proceeded to a depth of 270 metres. Underground development started in 1974 through a sampling programme. Underground production briefly took place in 1982 but ceased soon thereafter due to the 1981 slump in the diamond market. These operations were resumed in March 1987. During the period 1972 to the end of 2004, approximately 69.5 million tonnes of kimberlite ore were mined and 6.1 million carats of diamonds were recovered. In February 2006, De Beers ceased mining when the old order mining right for Koffiefontein expired and in July of that year Petra Diamonds commenced operating the mine under care and maintenance conditions. The acquisition of the mine was completed in July 2007 and Petra Diamonds was subsequently able to commence diamond recoveries by starting to process the stockpile through the plant.|$|R
60|$|From this point, turning {{abruptly}} {{from north}} to west, we took the steep narrow path which climbs the Akankon ridge, rising 78 feet above the river. A few paces led us to the <b>prospecting</b> <b>shaft,</b> a native pit squared and timbered by Mr. Cornish. He was assisted by Mr. James B. Ross, 'practical miner, working manager, and mine-owner for {{the last twenty years}} in Queensland, Australia.' He thus describes himself in the very able report which he sent to his company; and I am glad to hear that he has returned to the Gold Coast. The shaft, 40 feet from 'the outcrop,' and 50 from the hill-base, is bottomed at the depth of 52 feet. Unfortunately it is only box-timbered, and much of the woodwork was shaken down by the blasts. The sinking through stiff clay, stained with iron, cobalt, manganese, and cinnabar, was reported easy. But where the hanging and foot walls should have been, fragments of clay, iron, and mica-slate showed that the former lie still deeper. My companion proposed a descent into the shaft by bucket and windlass. I declined, greatly distrusting such deserted pits, especially in this region, where they appear unusually liable to foul. Two days afterwards a Kruboy went down and was brought to grass almost insensible from the choke-damp; his hands clenched the rope so tightly that their grip was hard to loose.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the evening}} we walked {{about half a}} mile to the {{south-west}} of the village, and <b>prospected</b> the central <b>shaft,</b> whence the measurements were made. Here it is sunk in a western reef, palpably running parallel with the eastern, which we first inspected. And this visit gave us a fair idea of the property. It consists of at least three ridges of clay running from north to south, and each containing one or more meridional walls of quartz. Some of the latter {{may turn out to be}} 'master lodes.' ...|$|R
40|$|The Mount Dore and Merlin deposit, {{discovered}} in 2008 by Chinova Resources (previously Ivanhoe Australia), is the world's highest grade Mo-Re deposit. The deposit {{is located in}} the Cloncurry District of the Mount Isa Inlier, Australia; a region renowned for its IOCG type mineralization. In the same year the Lanham's <b>Shaft</b> <b>prospect,</b> another Mo-rich occurrence was found 50 km {{to the north of the}} Merlin deposit. These discoveries have created a new exploration paradigm, and this thesis represents the first in-depth study of this new mineralization type. This work integrates detail core logging, petrography, geochronology, and trace element and isotope geochemistry. The Mount Dore and Merlin deposit is hosted by the Proterozoic Kuridala Formation metasedimentary package, which is composed of interbedded phyllites and carbonaceous slates above calc-silicate rocks, and silicified siltstones at the footwall. The Mount Dore granite is thrust above the metasedimentary rocks and overlies the bulk of the mineralization. The mineralization consists of a Cu-polymetallic stage (chalcopyrite ± sphalerite ±± galena) (Mount Dore) mainly hosted by the carbonaceous slates in angular clast-supported carbonate breccias, and Mo-Re mineralization (Merlin) that locally cuts the Cu-polymetallic mineralization, mainly along or near rheologic boundaries between the carbonaceous slates and the calc-silicate rocks. The bulk of the Mo-Re appears as infill of matrix-supported breccias with rounded clasts. The hydrothermal alteration is highly complex, consisting of three main stages, from oldest to youngest: Na-(Ca), Cu-polymetallic, and Mo-Re. These stages were dated using UPb in titanite and Re-Os in molybdenite at the Mount Dore and Merlin deposit and at the Lanham's <b>Shaft</b> <b>prospect.</b> The Na-(Ca) alteration (1557 ± 18 Ma) is similar to a regional Na-(Ca) alteration event with formation of albite + amphibole ± quartz ± titanite ± apatite ± carbonates. The alteration fluids are interpreted to be bittern brine(s) and the widespread regional Na-(Ca) alteration is thought of having been responsible for the release of potassium, iron, barium, and possibly copper and carbonate from the regional metasedimentary rocks. The Cu-polymetallic mineralization is accompanied by K-feldspar + tourmaline + carbonates ± quartz. This alteration stage is also interpreted to have formed by a bittern brine fluid that reacted with the metasedimentary host rocks. This reaction resulted in a strong decrease in the ƒO 2 of the fluid, due to the minor graphite contained in the carbonaceous slates that host the Cu-polymetallic mineralization. The ƒO₂ drop is proposed as the main chemical mechanism responsible for the sulfide precipitation, and the sulfur was sourced from both the bittern brine and the metasedimentary host rocks. Zinc, and at least part of the Pb and Ag, was possibly sourced from the carbonaceous slates. The third hydrothermal stage can be subdivided into three events, with the first and main event being responsible for the bulk of the Mo-Re mineralization and the last two events being remobilizations of the first event. The main Mo-Re event occurred at 1535 Ma and formed the strongly mineralized breccias that were accompanied by K-feldspar ± chlorite alteration. Fluid derived from a Williams-Naraku type felsic intrusive is proposed as the source of the mineralization with ore mineral precipitation triggered by a strong to moderate ƒO₂ drop during fluid reaction with the metasedimentary host rocks. Again, the sulfur is thought to be derived from both the mineralizing fluid and the host rocks. The second, relatively minor, Mo-Re event occurred at 1521 Ma and formed veins and disseminations that extend from the Mo-Re breccias into the calc-silicate rocks for several metres. This event is inferred to have developed from the previously formed Mo-Re mineralization by remobilization, due to the emplacement of the Mount Dore granite (1517 Ma), with formation of K-feldspar + chlorite ± apatite ± rutile ±± monazite. A ƒO₂ drop was again the ore precipitation mechanism, but the ƒO₂ decrease was not as strong in this mineralization, due to the relatively oxidized nature of the calc-silicate host rocks compared to the proximity (partly hosting) of the bulk of the Mo-Re mineralization to the carbonaceous slates. The sulfur was sourced from the previously formed molybdenite and therefore both mineralization styles have similar δ³⁴S signatures. A very minor Mo-Re event occurred at 1500 Ma and consists of millimetric Mo-Re veins in carbonate ± chlorite veins. This event was likely formed in response to the thrust of the Mount Dore granite over the metasedimentary host rocks, which is possibly responsible for the formation of the molybdenite stylolitic veins, which are a common feature in the deposit. The Lanham's <b>Shaft</b> <b>prospect</b> displays a similar hydrothermal alteration evolution, except that significant remobilization of the Mo-rich mineralization did not occur at this location. However, the absolute timing of the Na-(Ca) alteration (1575 Ma) and Mo-rich mineralization (1560 Ma) is earlier than at the Mount Dore and Merlin deposit. These older ages indicate the existence of hydrothermal activity with mineralizing capability during a time period that has previously been regarded as unprospective for ore deposit formation. The mineralization at the prospect is less abundant in grade and tonnage than the deposit, consisting of mineralized veins. The bulk of the Cu-rich and Mo-rich veins are a few metres from the carbonaceous slates, hosted in calc-silicate rocks. The distance of the mineralization to the graphitic rocks resulted in a weaker ƒO₂ drop in both stages. The mineralizing fluids are interpreted as also felsic igneous sourced and mixing of sulfur between the fluids and the metasedimentary rocks also occurred. The Merlin and Mount Dore and Lanham's Shaft mineralization have clear spatial and temporal affinities with IOCG mineralization in the Cloncurry District. Broad genetic relationships between these mineralization styles are also likely, so a denomination for this this new mineralization style is proposed as Mo-rich IOCG type deposits. The key criteria and ingredients for such deposits are: 1. Mo-rich felsic igneous source(s) and; 2. Suitable tectonic trap(s) contained within, or at close proximity to, reduced host rocks (e. g. carbonaceous or graphitic metasedimentary rocks) ...|$|R
