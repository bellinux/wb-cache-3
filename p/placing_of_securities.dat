60|$|This was {{no sooner}} said than done; Wycherly <b>placing</b> the bags <b>of</b> gold on the floor, until some other <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> could be provided.|$|R
60|$|As he spoke, a fresh roar of {{the fire}} up the hatch-way {{attracted}} attention. Gathering strength, it burst up in a bright flame, showing that the quarter-deck could not long remain a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security.</b>|$|R
60|$|Having put Miss Tippet and Emma in a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security,</b> the {{policeman}} {{was about to}} make a desperate attempt to reach the upper floor by rushing through the flames, when the escape came up and rendered it unnecessary.|$|R
50|$|Eilean Ruairidh Mòr {{was planted}} with pines in about 1815. There are {{remains of a}} {{subterranean}} circular structure, similar to a Scandinavian dùn or burgh. The ancestors of the Mackenzies of Gairloch held it as a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> from the attacks of the Macleods.|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, once a dog gets {{used to a}} crate, {{they can}} {{see it as a}} <b>place</b> <b>of</b> comfort and safety. The Humane Society of America {{recommends}} crate training to create a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> and comfort for a dog, while cautioning {{that it is not the}} best solution to animal behavior problems.|$|R
6000|$|... [32]They perish {{in sight}} <b>of</b> a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> which they cannot reach; they perish with the bitter remorse of having despised and {{rejected}} {{the means of}} escape, like the rich man in hell, whose torment was grievously augmented {{by the sight of}} Lazarus, afar off, in the bosom of Abraham.--Ed.|$|R
50|$|The {{whole of}} the Captain's papers and effects are sealed up, and will be kept in a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> until proper persons are {{appointed}} to examine them. Meanwhile, Madam, I beg leave to assure you of my readiness to give you any information, or render you any service in my power.|$|R
60|$|No further spur was needed. Miss Pritty {{scrambled}} {{up into the}} tree and crept towards her friend with such reckless haste {{that one of her}} feet slipped off the branch, and her leg passing through the foliage, appeared in the regions below. Recovering herself, she reached what she deemed a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security.</b>|$|R
6000|$|They had scarce {{got into}} the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> when the knight {{proceeded}} with his description.--"The petard being formed, as I tell you, is secured with a thick and strong piece of plank, termed the madrier, and the whole being suspended, or rather secured against the gate to be forced--But thou mindest me not?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Where {{there is}} no such instruction, the {{execution}} creditor or his attorney, after receiving notification of the attachment, may instruct the sheriff in writing either to remove the property to a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> or leave it upon the premises in the charge and custody of the debtor or another person acting on the sheriff’s behalf.|$|R

"Should Mr. Dodge {{consent to}} this arrangement, he will render himself liable {{to the charge}} of aristocracy," [...] said Mr. Sharp; for as all felt {{relieved}} by finding themselves in a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security,</b> so all felt disposed to join in the pleasantry. [...] "I dare say his modesty would prevent his consenting to the plan." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the study of sociological, social and {{psychological}} as well as individual and typological personality characteristics and essential professional qualities <b>of</b> the <b>security</b> officers specializing in various fields. The relevance of the research is entailed by the insufficient elaboration and representation of distinctive features, the correlation between the requirements of the specialized individual working <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> officers and personality characteristics as well as the essential professional qualities <b>of</b> <b>security</b> officers <b>of</b> Private <b>Security</b> Agencies (PSA) in sociology, social psychology, psychology of labour and psychogiagnosis...|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile Joe Crackenthorp, availing {{himself of}} the hasty {{permission}} attained from Redgauntlet, proceeded to assemble in one apartment those whose safe custody had been thought necessary; and, without much considering the propriety of the matter, he selected for the common <b>place</b> <b>of</b> confinement, the room which Lilias had, since her brother's departure, occupied alone. It had a strong lock, and was double-hinged, which probably led to the preference assigned to it, as a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fortunately, The first shocks were slight, {{which gave}} {{time for people}} {{to run out of}} the houses to <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> {{accounting}} for lesser loss of life. The quake also happened on a Sunday, the public and private establishments being closed, permitted the families to be collected. Had the earthquake happened at night with the majority using lamp with kerosene oil, nothing could have stopped a fallen lamp from spreading fire to a fallen building.|$|R
6000|$|... "Enough, {{my dearest}} lady," [...] said Rose;---"yet not so. Permit me one word more. Since you are {{determined}} not to avail yourself of your freedom, even when the fatal period of your engagement is expired, why suffer this young man to share our solitude?--He is surely well enough to be removed to some other <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security.</b> Let us resume our former sequestered mode of life, until Providence send us some better or more certain prospects." ...|$|R
60|$|The latter end of July {{the king}} {{received}} advice that the Imperialists {{had formed a}} magazine for provision at a town called Freynstat, twenty miles from Nuremberg. Hither all the booty and contributions raised in the Upper Palatinate, and parts adjacent, was brought and laid up as in a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security,</b> a garrison <b>of</b> 600 men being placed to defend it; and when a quantity of provisions was got together, convoys were appointed to fetch it off.|$|R
60|$|He {{sat down}} and wrote a few lines to Miss Dows stating that, in view of some {{threatened}} disturbances in the town, he thought it advisable to keep the negroes in their quarters, whither he was himself going. He sent her his housekeeper and the child, as they had both better remain in a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> until he returned to town. He gave the note to Zoe, bidding her hasten by the back garden across the fields. Then he turned to Cato.|$|R
40|$|Housing is many things: a basic {{survival}} need; {{an expression}} of how we see ourselves and our status in society; and a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security,</b> domesticity and privacy. Each of these meanings of housing implicates an individual or social need that is a proper concern for federal policy. Indeed, the central goal of our nation 2 ̆ 7 s housing policy has long been to provide 2 ̆ 2 a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family. 2 ̆ 22 ̆...|$|R

50|$|It was a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> minimal <b>security</b> risk until around 1999-2000. After September 11 {{attacks and}} the Indian {{parliament}} attack in 2001, the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> {{the area was}} increased, and all type of leisure activities surrounding the area were stopped.|$|R
60|$|It is {{impossible}} to reinforce you for your present emergency. If we had a million of men, We could not get them to you in time. We have not the men to send. If you are {{not strong enough to}} face the enemy, you must find a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security,</b> and wait, rest, and repair. Maintain your ground if you can, but save the army at all events, even if you fall back to Fort Monroe. We still have strength enough in the country, and will bring it out.|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{the prince}} had {{often said that}} all his kindred were dead, the captain had no {{conscientious}} scruples in retaining the gift. He locked it away in his cabin. When the voyage was finished--at Calcutta--the men were paid off. The captain then be-thought him <b>of</b> <b>placing</b> his treasure in some <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> in the city. He went to his chest {{and took out the}} box--it was light--he opened it hastily--the contents were gone! Nothing was left to him of that splendid gift save the ring, which he had placed on his finger soon after receiving it, and had worn ever since.|$|R
6000|$|... "His {{safety is}} cared for," [...] said Seyton; [...] "he must not remain here, {{but will be}} privately {{conducted}} to a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> greater <b>security.</b> But I would your Grace were in the saddle.--To horse! to horse!" ...|$|R
2500|$|On December 10, Houston privately tasked Colonel Thomas I. Smith and Captain Eli Chandler with {{moving the}} nation's {{archives}} to Washington-on-the-Brazos. Houston wrote that [...] "The importance of removing the public archives and government stores from their present dangerous {{situation at the}} City of Austin to a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security,</b> is becoming daily more and more imperative. While they remain where they are, {{no one knows the}} hour when they may be utterly destroyed." [...] The men were encouraged to raise a small troop on the premise of conducting an excursion against the native tribes, then quickly secure the archives and transport them.|$|R
50|$|Cloyne {{appears to}} have been his {{earliest}} settlement. The cathedral and round tower are situated on a limestone eminence {{in the midst of the}} valley, surrounded by rich meadows. In the rock is the cave extending in various branches underground to a great distance, from which the town derives its name. Here it is supposed Colman took up his abode as a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> and the remains of his primitive oratory, known as Colman's Chapel were still to be seen in 1813. Colmán is also believed to have founded a monastery at what would become Killagha Abbey in County Kerry.|$|R

60|$|And Lord Kilcullen, {{though he}} had spoken so coolly on the subject, and had snubbed his father, was equally in a hurry. He also {{received}} letters, and threats, and warnings, and understood, even better than his father did, the perils which awaited him. He knew that he couldn't remain at Grey Abbey another week; that {{in a day or}} two it wouldn't be safe for him to leave the house; and that his only chance was at once to obtain the promise of his cousin's hand, and then betake himself to some <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security,</b> till he could make her fortune available.|$|R
60|$|At {{starting}} on this overland route they buried some provisions, and {{putting in a}} <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> their canoe and such stores as they did not require or could not carry, they set out, each man laden with a burden varying from forty-five to ninety pounds weight, besides arms and ammunition. They were led by an Indian guide with several of his relations, and followed by their dog Wolf. This guide was deemed necessary, {{not so much to}} show the way as to introduce them to the various tribes through whose territory they should have to pass.|$|R
60|$|The {{policy which}} Fabius {{resolved}} to adopt was, {{not to give}} Hannibal battle, but to watch him, and wear his army out by fatigue and delays. He kept, therefore, near him, but always posted his army on advantageous ground, which all the defiance and provocations of Hannibal could not induce him to leave. When Hannibal moved, which he was soon compelled to do to procure provisions, Fabius would move too, but only to post and intrench himself in some <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> as before. Hannibal did every thing {{in his power to}} bring Fabius to battle, but all his efforts were unavailing.|$|R
5000|$|Now Vespasian {{was very}} desirous of {{demolishing}} Jotapata, {{for he had}} gotten intelligence that the greatest part of the enemy had retired thither, and that it was, on other accounts, a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> great <b>security</b> to them. Flavius Josephus ...|$|R
50|$|On 27 July 1761, Since {{our last}} {{a man has}} been apprehended on {{suspicion}} of the murder and robbery of Mr. Roach last Saturday se'en night in the evening; he says he formerly belonged to the regiment of Royal Gloucestershire Hussars Y. Buffs, (Royal Gloucestershire Hussars) but, having a rupture, was discharged, and that he supported himself by travelling about the country, his account of supporting himself, however was so lame, he is committed to a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> at Devices for further examination. This {{could have been the}} former Roundway Hospital near Devizes, Wiltshire. Roundway wasn't opened until 1845 so maybe he was taken to a Village lock-up near there.|$|R
5000|$|The idea of America's {{backyard}} - a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> and tranquility, unlike {{lines of}} conflict elsewhere - {{has been used}} in reference to middle America. For example, after the Oklahoma City bombing, Americans were outspoken with their shock that this attack took place in a [...] "Middle-American" [...] town rather than one of America's well-known political or economical cities or abroad. Many expressed surprise that such terrorism could happen in {{the very center of the}} United States, [...] "deep in America's heartland." [...] Furthermore, [...] "America's Backyard" [...] has appeared interchangeably with [...] "heartland" [...] in the writings of a variety of journalists, authors, war veterans and bloggers.|$|R
60|$|In {{the mean}} time, while these works and {{performances}} were going on, the soldiers gave themselves up to indulgences of every kind. Great stores of wine {{were found in}} the place, which were bestowed upon the troops, and the streets, day and night, were filled with riotous revelings. The commanders themselves--the knights and barons--and all the other men of rank that pertained to the army, fell into the same way, and they were very unwilling that the time should come when they were to leave such a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> and indulgence, and take the field again for a march in pursuit of Saladin.|$|R
60|$|Being very strong, and the {{neighbourhood}} being {{mostly of}} the Roundhead mind, his castle {{had been used}} as a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> by many <b>of</b> the gentry of the Parliamentary party while the Royal forces were near, and they had not yet entirely dispersed, so that the place overflowed with guests; and when Harry and Eustace came down to supper, they found the hall full of company. Lord Walwyn was received as if he were simply a guest. While he was being presented to the hostess on coming down to supper, there was a low cry, then a confusion among the ladies, round some one who had fainted.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{just what}} I want, Chingatok," [...] said the Captain with a joyful look, [...] "only aid me in this matter, and I will reward you well. I've already told you that my ship is wrecked, and that the crew, except those you see here, have left me; but I have saved all the cargo and buried it in a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> with the {{exception}} of those things which I need for my expedition. One half of these things are on this sledge,--the other half on a sledge left behind and ready packed near the wreck. Now, I want you to send men to fetch that sledge here." ...|$|R
