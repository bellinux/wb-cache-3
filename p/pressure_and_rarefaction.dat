40|$|In {{this paper}} {{examples}} of the shock-induced defects produced during shock compression which correlate with microstructure/mechanical property changes induced in materials due to shock prestraining are discussed. The characteristics of the shock impulse(peak shock <b>pressure,</b> pulse duration, <b>and</b> <b>rarefaction</b> rate) imparted to the material under investigation and the shock-induced defects produced in numerous metals and alloys are compared with their deformation behavior at ordinary rates of deformation. Examples {{of the range of}} defects observed in shock-recovered metals and alloys, include: dislocations, deformation twins, point defects, and residual metastable remnants from pressure-induced phase transformations. Results concerning the influence of interstitial content on the propensity of {omega}-phase formation and its structure in high-purity and A- 7 O Ti are presented. The influence of shock-wave deformation on the phase stability and substructure evolution of high-purity (low-interstitial) titanium and A- 7 O (3, 700 ppm oxygen) titanium were probed utilizing real-time velocity interferometry (VISAR) and soft shock-recovery techniques. Suppression of the {alpha}-{omega} pressure-induced phase transformation in A- 70 Ti, containing a high interstitial oxygen content, is seen to simultaneously correspond with the suppression of deformation twinning...|$|R

Although initially the jet is kinematically dominated, we have considered axial, toroidal, and helical magnetic fields to investigate the effects of different magnetic-field topologies and strengths on the recollimation structures. We find that an axial field introduces a larger effective gas <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> leads to stronger recollimation shocks <b>and</b> <b>rarefactions,</b> resulting in larger flow variations. The jet boost grows quadratically with the initial magnetic field. On the other hand, a toroidal field leads to weaker recollimation shocks <b>and</b> <b>rarefactions,</b> significantly modifying the jet structure after the first recollimation <b>rarefaction</b> <b>and</b> shock. The jet boost decreases systematically. For a helical field, instead, the behavior depends on the magnetic pitch, with a phenomenology that ranges between the one seen for axial and toroidal magnetic fields, respectively. In general, however, a helical magnetic field yields a more complex shock <b>and</b> <b>rarefaction</b> substructure close to the inlet that significantly modifies the jet structure. The differences in shock structure resulting from different field configurations and strengths may have observable consequences for disturbances propagating through a stationary recollimation shock.

50|$|Note {{that since}} {{dissipation}} solely {{relies on the}} resistive element it is independent of frequency. In practice however the resistive element varies with frequency. For instance, vibrations of most materials change their physical structure and so their physical properties; {{the result is a}} change in the 'resistance' equivalence. Additionally, the cycle of compression <b>and</b> <b>rarefaction</b> exhibits hysteresis of pressure waves in most materials which is a function of frequency, so for every compression there is a <b>rarefaction,</b> <b>and</b> the total amount of energy dissipated due to hysteresis changes with frequency. Furthermore, some materials behave in a non-Newtonian way, which causes their viscosity to change with the rate of shear strain experienced during compression and rarefaction; again, this varies with frequency. Gasses and liquids generally exhibit less hysteresis than solid materials (e.g., sound waves cause adiabatic compression <b>and</b> <b>rarefaction)</b> <b>and</b> behave in a, mostly, Newtonian way.|$|R

To consider compressibility <b>and</b> <b>rarefaction</b> effects, two relaxation time models related to Knudsen number Kn and local density are used. Diffuse-scattering boundary condition (DSBC) and {{a combination of}} bounce back and specular boundary conditions are used to obtain slip velocity at the wall.

The nonlinear <b>pressure</b> drop <b>and</b> the velocity distribution along the streamwise direction in the micro-channel flow are obtained and compared with available data, which resulted in good agreement.

The scheme combines the Lagrangian method with the MMPDE moving mesh method and adaptively moves the mesh to better resolve shock {{and other types of}} waves while preventing the mesh from crossing and tangling. It {{can be viewed as a}} direct arbitrarily Lagrangian-Eulerian method but can also be degenerated to a purely Lagrangian scheme. It treats the relative velocity of the fluid with respect to the mesh as constant in time between time steps, which allows high-order approximation of free boundaries. A time dependent scaling is used in the monitor function to avoid possible sudden movement of the mesh points due to the creation or diminishing of shock <b>and</b> <b>rarefaction</b> waves or the steepening of those waves. A two-rarefaction Riemann solver with elastic waves is employed to compute the Godunov values of the density, <b>pressure,</b> velocity, <b>and</b> deviatoric stress at cell interfaces.

The third-order convergence of the scheme and its ability to concentrate mesh points around shock <b>and</b> elastic <b>rarefaction</b> waves are demonstrated.

The concept of “δ-entropy ” solutions (a“δ-entropy test”) and others are developed for distinguishing shock <b>and</b> <b>rarefaction</b> waves by using stable smooth δ-deformations of discontinuous solutions. These are analogous to entropy solutions for scalar conservation laws such as ut + uux = 0, developed by Oleinik and Kruzhkov (in R N) in the 1950 - 60 s. The Rosenau–Hyman K(2, 2) (compacton) equation ut = (uux) xx + 4 uux, which has a special importance for applications, is studied.
