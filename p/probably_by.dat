5|$|A Roman {{colonnade}} {{was built}} in the third century, <b>probably</b> <b>by</b> emperor Septimius Severus, and a Roman Villa showed a period of renewed relative importance for the city during the late period of Phoenicia under Roman rule. Furthermore, within the original Phoenician temple site the Romans added the processional stairway, the basins for ablutions and a nymphaeum with pictorial mosaics, that are still largely intact. Worn statuettes of three nymphs stand in the niches of a Roman fountain.|$|E
5|$|Although {{its origins}} are obscure, {{the site of}} the present ancient church has been used for Christian worship since it was settled in the early sixth century, <b>probably</b> <b>by</b> Saint Padarn, after whom it was named. Much of the early history of the church must remain {{speculative}} rather than definitive, due the absence of documentary or archaeological evidence. However, there are certain elements which are reasonably clear.|$|E
5|$|Auxiliary regiments {{were now}} {{led by a}} praefectus (prefect), who could be either a native nobleman, who would {{probably}} be granted Roman citizenship for the purpose (e.g. the famous German war leader Arminius gained Roman citizenship <b>probably</b> <b>by</b> serving as an auxiliary prefect before turning against Rome); or a Roman, either of knightly rank, or a senior centurion.|$|E

5|$|From {{the start}} of the liturgical year on the first Sunday in Advent, Bach {{composed}} prolifically. He wrote works for three consecutive Sundays in Advent, prompted <b>probably</b> <b>by</b> the death of the Kapellmeister Johann Samuel Drese on 1 December 1716. When Bach's hope to become Drese's successor was not realized, he ceased to compose cantatas for the Weimar court.|$|E
5|$|Green {{the color}} most {{commonly}} associated in Europe and the U.S. with youth. It also often {{is used to}} describe anyone young, inexperienced, <b>probably</b> <b>by</b> the analogy to immature and unripe fruit. Examples include green cheese, a term for a fresh, unaged cheese, and greenhorn, an inexperienced person.|$|E
5|$|He {{was buried}} in the family {{mausoleum}} at Kinross Kirk. The ruins of the church still stand beside Kinross House, the mausoleum remains intact in the churchyard. Dating from 1675 it is <b>probably</b> <b>by</b> William Bruce in design, initially to house his parents.|$|E
30|$|Higher {{emissions}} of tebuconazole in the TS- 2 experiment were <b>probably</b> caused <b>by</b> the higher {{amount of water}} per unit surface area, whereas slightly higher {{emissions of}} copper in OECD 313 experiments were <b>probably</b> caused <b>by</b> higher DOC concentrations in the eluates from this test.|$|R
50|$|The {{wound on}} his {{forehead}} was <b>probably</b> caused <b>by</b> a Hyksos axe and his neck wound was <b>probably</b> caused <b>by</b> a dagger while he was prone. There are no wounds on his arms or hands, which suggests {{he was not able}} to defend himself.|$|R

5|$|In 907 Chester was refortified {{against the}} threat from the Vikings, and shortly {{afterwards}} the minster was founded or refounded, and Werburgh's remains were transferred there from Hanbury, <b>probably</b> <b>by</b> Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians. The collegiate church, as it was then, was restored in 1057 by Leofric, Earl of Mercia and Lady Godiva. This church was razed to the ground around 1090, with the secular canons evicted, and no known trace of it remains.|$|E
5|$|In {{his fourth}} year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, Bach {{performed}} 18 cantatas composed by his relative Johann Ludwig Bach, a court musician in Meiningen. He then set {{some of the}} texts himself, including this cantata, written <b>probably</b> <b>by</b> Ernst Ludwig, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. They follow a pattern: seven movements are divided in two parts, both beginning with biblical quotations, Part I from the Old Testament, Part II from the New Testament.|$|E
5|$|Pest {{control is}} at least as old as agriculture, as {{there has always been a}} need to keep crops free from pests. As long ago as 3000 BC in Egypt, cats were used to control pests of grain stores such as rodents. Ferrets were domesticated by 500 AD in Europe for use as mousers. Mongooses were {{introduced}} into homes to control rodents and snakes, <b>probably</b> <b>by</b> the ancient Egyptians.|$|E

5|$|Shortly afterwards, around 5 p.m., Wick's Bf 109 E-4 (Werknummer 5344 — factory number) {{was shot}} down, <b>probably</b> <b>by</b> twelve–victory ace Flight Lieutenant John Dundas of No. 609 Squadron, {{though it is}} also {{possible}} that Wick fell victim to Pilot Officer Eric Marrs; Polish pilot Zygmunt Klein of 234 Squadron may have also scored hits on Wick's aircraft; he was also shot down and killed during the battle.|$|E
5|$|The Exeter Domesday Book records that, at {{the death}} of Edward the Confessor in 1066, the site was held (<b>probably</b> <b>by</b> lease from the Abbey) by one Uluert, and by Roger de Corcella {{at the time of}} the survey in 1086. When Roger de Corcella died, {{sometime}} before or around 1100, the land passed to the Malets, a prominent Norman family whose name was added to that of the settlement (and another of their holdings, Curi– now Curry Mallet).|$|E
5|$|The {{battle at}} Catraeth {{has been seen}} as an attempt to resist the advance of the Angles, who had <b>probably</b> <b>by</b> then {{occupied}} the former Votadini lands of Bryneich in modern north-eastern England and made it their kingdom of Bernicia. At some time after the battle, the Angles absorbed the Gododdin kingdom, possibly after the fall of their capital Din Eidyn in 638, and incorporated it into the kingdom of Northumbria.|$|E

5|$|The castle was redeveloped in {{the second}} half of the 16th century, <b>probably</b> <b>by</b> the Praters: the windows were {{enlarged}} to let in more light; a grand staircase was built in one of the towers; a Catholic altar was installed, and a revetment, or terrace, was built around the inside of the moat, leaving it 25 feet (7.6 m) wide.|$|E
5|$|The hill fort was {{constructed}} during the Iron Age, <b>probably</b> <b>by</b> the local Dobunni tribe, however {{the details are}} not fully known. The discovery of a bronze spear or axe head at the site indicates use before the Iron Age. The Bronze Age spearhead is in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton.|$|E
5|$|There is a Vita sancti Oswaldi auctore anonymo (Anonymous Life of Saint Oswald), written {{soon after}} Oswald's death (<b>probably</b> <b>by</b> Byrhtferth) that {{did much to}} spread his cult {{throughout}} England. Later, Eadmer wrote Vita sancti Oswaldi (Life of Saint Oswald) and Miracula sancti Oswaldi (Miracles of Saint Oswald) {{at the request of}} the chapter of Worcester. There is also a life written by Senatus, prior of Worcester, and important biographical information in the Historia Rameseiensis.|$|E

5|$|Through his {{critical}} writings, published {{under his}} own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards {{the end of his}} life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, <b>probably</b> <b>by</b> his own hand.|$|E

Around the central scene small figures of the twelve Apostles carrying their identifying attributes emerge from the foliage border of oak leaves and tendrils; the uppermost heads on each side are replacements, <b>probably</b> <b>by</b> Weininger in the 1860s.|$|E
5|$|Verdi had {{intended}} to return to Italy in early 1848, but was prevented by work and illness, as well as, most <b>probably,</b> <b>by</b> his increasing attachment to Strepponi. Verdi and Strepponi left Paris in July 1849, the immediate cause being an outbreak of cholera, and Verdi went directly to Busseto to continue work on completing his latest opera, Luisa Miller, for a production in Naples later in the year.|$|E
