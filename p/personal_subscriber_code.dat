50|$|As {{codes are}} being exhausted, a new range, 09x is made {{available}} for assignment.

50|$|In October 1947, {{the final}} plan was adopted; Kansas' two area codes had been radically altered from the {{original}} plan. Southern Kansas (Wichita, Dodge City, Emporia, Garden City) received 316, while the northern half (Kansas City, Topeka, Lawrence, Salina, Hays) got 913. Long-distance dialing by <b>subscribers</b> using area <b>codes</b> would not be implemented until late 1951 in New Jersey.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Mobile devices like {{smartphones}} and tablets {{are commonly}} used for personal and business purpose. Enterprises are more concerns about security of mobile devices compared to <b>personal</b> mobile <b>subscribers.</b> The challenges an enterprise may face include unlimited access to corporate resources, lack of encryption on corporate data, unwillingness to backup data, etc. Many of these issues have been resolved by auditing and enforcing security policies in enterprise networks. However, {{it is difficult to}} audit and enforce security policies on mobile devices. A substantial discrepancy exists between enterprise security policy administration and security policy enforcement. So in this paper we will study different security policies...|$|R
50|$|In {{industry}} jargon, these area {{codes and}} prefixes {{are referred to}} as NDC codes (National Dialing Codes). This is the term used by ComReg and technical documents, as they include non-geographic codes. Historically, like the UK, the term STD <b>code</b> (<b>Subscriber</b> Trunk Dialling) was used.However, the terminology is archaic and is no longer universally understood and should not be used to avoid confusion.|$|R

5000|$|Shaw Direct invokes simsubs {{according}} to a <b>subscriber's</b> postal <b>code,</b> and is implemented by the receiver's firmware; this method enforces simsubs only in areas where they are legally needed. Beginning in February 2012, however, Shaw Direct began implementing simsubs for the Global network's HD feed (channel 256) for all of their high-definition subscribers, which affects ABC East HD (WXYZ-TV), CBS East HD (WWJ-TV), Fox East HD (WUHF) and NBC East HD (WDIV-TV). It is speculated that {{this is due to}} the 2010 purchase of the Global Television Network by Shaw Communications. At first, no other channels were simsubbed, but Shaw Direct later began implementing simsubs for City, but still does not do so for CTV, its main competitor.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005 a Dutch {{court ordered}} ISPs in the Netherlands to not divulge {{subscriber}} information {{because of the}} way the Dutch content industry group had collected the IP addresses (Foundation v. UPC Netherlands). According to Dutch law ISPs can only be ordered to provide <b>personal</b> <b>subscriber</b> data if it is plausible that an unlawful act occurred, and if it is shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the subscriber information will identify the person who committed the infringing act. In Germany court specifically considered the right to privacy and in March 2008 the German Federal Constitutional Court ruled that ISPs could only give out IP address subscription information in case of a [...] "serious criminal investigation". The court furthermore ruled that copyright infringement did not qualify as a serious enough offense. Subsequently, in April 2008, the Bundestag (German parliament) approved a new law requiring ISPs to divulge the identity of suspected infringers who infringe on a commercial scale. In Spain the Spanish Supreme Court recently ruled that personal data associated with an IP address could only be disclosed in the course of a criminal investigation or for public safety reasons (Productores de Música de España v. Telefónica de España SAU). In Italy courts established that criminally liability does not extend to file sharing copyrighted material, as long as it is not done for commercial gain. Ruling on a case involving a copyright holder employed a third party to collect IP addresses of suspected copyright infringers, the Italian Data Protection Authority ruled in February 2008 that the systematic monitoring of peer-to-peer activities for the purpose of detecting copyright infringers and suing them is not allowed.|$|R
50|$|For {{landline}} <b>subscribers,</b> {{the area}} <b>code,</b> prefixed by the digit '2', {{was incorporated into}} the subscriber's number. For mobile subscribers, formerly seven (to call another subscriber using the same operator) or eleven (to call any mobile subscriber) digits were used. For special number ranges, formerly ten digits were used, but the initial '0' was dropped. These changes made that nine digits were used for all calls after 1999.|$|R
50|$|As step offices became rarer, <b>Subscriber</b> Trunk Dialing <b>Codes</b> {{no longer}} {{followed}} the original rules, and were significantly revised in the mid-1990s, with further changes as wider use of mobile phones and non-BT competition {{came into the}} UK market. There are now some 70000 local exchange codes in use in the UK. The largest trunk carrier, British Telecom, connects the local network through some 60 transit (tandem) switches.|$|R

Similarly, in Sweden, a controversial file sharing bill is awaiting the Riksdag’s approval. The law, which would enter into effect on 1 April 2009, would allow copyright holders to request the IP addresses and names of copyright infringement suspects in order to take legal action against them. The copyright holders, though, should present sufficient evidence of harm to justify the release of information regarding the Internet subscribers. In Italy, the courts established that criminal liability does not extend to file sharing copyrighted material, as long as it is not done for commercial gain. Ruling on a case involving a copyright holder who employed a third party to collect IP addresses of suspected copyright infringers, the Italian Data Protection Authority ruled in February 2008 that the systematic monitoring peer-to-peer activities for the purpose of detecting copyright infringers and suing them is prohibited.|$|R
5000|$|Prodigy's initial {{business}} model relied more on advertising and online shopping for cash flow than monthly subscriptions. Subscribers were charged a flat monthly fee that provided unlimited access. Initially, a monthly rate was charged for an unlimited usage time and 30 <b>personal</b> messages. <b>Subscribers</b> could purchase additional messages for a fee. Later, Prodigy would divide its service into [...] "Core" [...] and [...] "Plus" [...] sections. Core section usage remained unlimited, but Plus sections were limited by usage time. Subscribers {{were given a}} monthly allotment of Plus time and if that time was exceeded, the subscriber would incur additional charges based on usage time. Subscribers could easily tell what type of section they were in by looking at a blue indicator in the bottom-right corner of the screen.|$|R
