This study evaluated whether Korean <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> free fatty acids (FFA) and triglycerides (TG) work as an appetite suppressant. Korean <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> FFA were evaluated in STC- 1 cell culture for their ability to increase cholecystokinin (CCK- 8) secretion vs. several other dietary fatty acids from Italian stone <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> fatty acids, oleic acid, linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, and capric acid used as a control. At 50 μM concentration, Korean <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> FFA produced the greatest amount of CCK- 8 release (493 pg/ml) relative to the other fatty acids and control (46 pg/ml). A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over trial including 18 overweight post-menopausal women was performed. Subjects received capsules with 3 g Korean <b>pine</b> (Pinus koraiensis) <b>nut</b> FFA, 3 g <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> TG or 3 g placebo (olive oil) in combination with a light breakfast. At 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 minutes the gut hormones cholecystokinin (CCK- 8), glucagon like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1), peptide YY (PYY) and ghrelin, and appetite sensations were measured. A wash-out period of one week separated each intervention day. CCK- 8 was higher 30 min after <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> FFA and 60 min after <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> TG when compared to placebo (p < 0. 01). GLP- 1 was higher 60 min after <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> FFA compared to placebo (p < 0. 01). Over a period of 4 hours the total amount of plasma CCK- 8 was 60 % higher after <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> FFA and 22 % higher after <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> TG than after placebo (p < 0. 01). For GLP- 1 this difference was 25 % after <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> FFA (P < 0. 05). Ghrelin and PYY levels were not different between groups. The appetite sensation "prospective food intake" was 36 % lower after <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> FFA relative to placebo (P < 0. 05). This study suggests that Korean <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> may work as an appetite suppressant through an increasing effect on satiety hormones and a reduced prospective food intake. © 2008 Pasman et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
