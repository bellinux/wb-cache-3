Firstly, we consider asymmetry among coun- tries, dividing them in two types: developed countries that have a considerable environmental awareness and developing ones that pay a less attention to environmental preservation. Sec- ondly, we introduce a positive externality in the cooperation where countries coordinate their R&D activities sharing the investments in order to avoid duplication of green activities. Other- wise, the non-cooperators support completely their R&D investments for clean technologies. These two aspects encourage the formation of stable coalitions till to determine conditions for which also the grand coalition is stable...|$|E

40|$|China's air {{pollution}} issue, {{a byproduct of}} recent phenomenal economic growth, has received increasing attention in light of its local and large-scale impacts. I investigated the emissions, transport, and evolution of pollutants from China using measurements near some source regions in northern China in 2005. Surface pollution near Beijing in March was overall heavy but changed dramatically, as passing mid-latitude cyclones led to fast transitions between polluted prefrontal and clean postfrontal conditions. Large differences found between measurements and inventories suggest substantial uncertainties in emission estimates. Small, coal-fired boilers are shown unlikely to be {{the major source of}} inventory error; experiments measuring traffic emissions are called for. Ground-level aerosols absorb light and are from both wind-blown dust and anthropogenic emissions. Their effects on climate are to be further studied. Pollutants at higher altitudes {{are more likely to have}} large-scale impact than pollutants that remain near the surface. The aircraft campaign in April was among the first efforts to measure the vertical distribution of pollutants over inland China. The largest pollutant levels observed in the free troposphere during the campaign were related to dry convective lofting over an industrial region. This differs from earlier experiments over the Pacific, which recognized the warm conveyor belt (WCB) as the main lofting mechanism. Dry convection over the continent may be followed by WCB lifting as the systems move out over the ocean. Their relative roles are yet to be determined. Analyses of meteorological and satellite cloud data reveal the importance of in-cloud processing in oxidizing SO 2 transported behind cold fronts. Through integration of satellite sensors, in-situ measurements, trajectory and chemical transport models, I tracked a pollution plume as it traveled away from source region. The decay of SO 2 in the plume over three days was quantified, suggesting an SO 2 lifetime of 1 - 4 d. Formation of sulfate and loss of dust together changed the aerosol loading of the plume. This analysis showcases the potential for employing satellites to trace transport events and <b>pollutant</b> <b>evolution,</b> and highlights the main uncertainties in quantitative application of satellite data...|$|E

The aquifer was in hydraulic equilibrium with an artificial canal whose water level was highly variable (up to 5 m). These variations propagated into the aquifer, causing changes in the groundwater flow direction; a transient numerical model of flow and solute transport showed that they correlate with the concentration variations because the changes in the flow direction resulted in the contaminant plume shifting.

40|$|International audienceAbstractTo understand, {{evaluate}} and finely predict the spatiotemporal <b>pollutants</b> <b>evolution</b> in environments, under natural attenuation or remediation (by bio- or chemical treatment), {{it is necessary}} to resort to: i) geophysical, physico-chemical and biological measurements on site, ii) laboratory treatability experiments, and iii) numerical models. In practice, that results in the use of parameters and/or empirical models for modeling on the scale of an actual site. This use permits to reproduce the controlled tests in laboratory or on site, which are used then as validation tests. However, their use for predictive calculations is problematic for the tests, where it is impossible to sweep the whole of conditions and couplings met in the system of interest. Within the framework of a predictive model, the improvement or invalidation of the empirical parameters/models must thus be done on the basis of comprehension of the subjacent mechanisms and their mutual interactions. With this purpose, {{it is necessary to}} have recourse to mechanistic and multi-scale approaches with uncertainties estimate, which makes it possible to choose in a reasoned way the dominating mechanisms and their simplified exemplification. MULTISCALEXPER project has as a principal objective to develop actions of multi-scale experimentation, utilizing numerical modeling on all the levels (from dimensioning to the interpretation of the results). These actions will be carried out using numerical tools and multi-scale pilots. More particularly, {{it is a question of}} defining a dimensioning methodology for multi-scale experiments, based on numerical approaches. This project aims at reinforcing the depollution techniques on: i) the small scales in order to be able to interact with academic laboratories, working at increasingly smaller scale, and especially ii) the great scales in order to be able to interact with depollution firms, directed in the reverse way of increasingly large scale as fast as possible. The first deliverable of the project was the critical analysis of about 15 BRGM collaborative projects, carried out in the depollution domain both of organic and inorganic pollutants. The projects were evaluated on the basis of a grid of techno-economic criteria and compared to the scale imitated, according to two approaches: 1) multi-scale experimentation (from a molecular scale to that of an actual site), in batch, column, plurimetric pilot, in situ demonstration, partial or total depollution of a site and 2) multi-scale numerical modeling. The advantages, disadvantages, redundancies and failures concerning each approach and scale were highlighted. It results very rich issues from it, showing that only scientific and technical knowledge were not enough to solve complex problems. In a way much more pragmatic, it is shown that it is necessary to innovate in approaches and scales. In particular, in porous media, the feasibility of an integrated approach on a precise depollution subject depends on the pollutant behavior characterization and treatability on a large scale. The work, in different media and contexts, will have to be organized to cover all the stages allowing pollutants treatability by controlled, reasoned and pragmatic implementation of the methods and scales.

In this context, the deployment and observation of enhanced fluorescent particles is studied in [Tauro et al., 2012] to non- intrusively estimate surface flow velocities and travel times. Such insoluble and buoyant fluorescent particles are not affected by adsorption issues, thus requiring minimal amounts of tracing material to be released in the environment, and are detected through commercially available inexpensive digital cameras. In this paper, we complement previously developed unsupervised particle detection tools with Large Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV) analysis for surface flow estimations in natural settings. Specifically, we conduct several proof of concept experiments by deploying few grams of fluorescent particles in a natural brook and analyzing acquired videos with both unsupervised image analysis tools and LSPIV. Results from both methodologies suggest their complementary use for enhanced surface flow monitoring. In addition, the use of environmentally friendly highly visible fluorescent particles would sensibly improve the joint performance of such non-intrusive sensing systems...|$|R

40|$|During {{operation}} on road {{and due to}} gradual ageing of a vehicle, the formation of gaseous <b>pollutants</b> undergoes certain <b>evolution.</b> At {{the start of the}} vehicle life the evolution is influenced mostly by the run-in period of the driving mechanism. Motor vehicle manufacturers state that the vehicle run-in period ends after the vehicle has run from 3, 000 - 15, 000 kilometers depending on the engine type and transmission mechanism. During the run-in period the fuel consumption decreases and the production of emissions slightly changes, which consequently influences the emission factor. (The emission factor is understood as the ratio between the pollutant produced and the amount of consumed fuel). A theoretical value of the difference in the fuel consumption between the new and run-in vehicle is about 8 % in favor of the run-in vehicle. The European legislation does not specify after how many kilometers the vehicle stops to be considered new. This can lead to disputes when testing emissions from the new vehicle and those from the vehicle having the control software already installed. The contribution outlines a possibility of determining the coefficient for calculation of emissions and fuel consumption for the first tested vehicle and for the one that has covered from 60 to 300 kilometres. It may contribute to the optimization of the control software installed in the vehicle...|$|R

A number of factors are known to influence the initiation and subsequent rate of corrosion in metallic bridges, including climatic parameters such as relative humidity and temperature, atmospheric pollutants (e. g. SO 2) and high airborne salinity. These factors and their interactions may have a detrimental influence on the rate of corrosion. Alterations of the exposure conditions, for instance due to climate change or/and adoption of government policies related to the levels of atmospheric pollutants, are likely to influence the long-term corrosion rates in metallic bridges. This paper presents a methodology, based on reliability analysis, for the time-dependent risk assessment of corroding metallic railway bridges, considering the impact of long-term changes in climatic and atmospheric <b>pollutant</b> variables. The <b>evolution</b> of variables related to the deterioration process (e. g. climatic parameters, atmospheric pollutants, etc) and bridge resistance variables are treated as random using suitable distributions. The time evolution of the probability of failure of the bridge is quantified through Monte Carlo simulation and this is then extended into risk by considering the consequences of bridge failure.

Although it possesses much functionality, large bandgap and massive charge carrier recombination limits its wide utility under natural solar light. These drawbacks were overcome through nitrogen doping in titania matrix (N-TiO 2), which alters the surface-bulk structure for visible light absorption with high quantum efficiency. In this review, we highlight the recent progress of N-TiO 2 towards <b>pollutant</b> degradation, hydrogen <b>evolution</b> and its use in organic synthesis under ambient conditions. The preparation of N-TiO 2 via different methods (physical and chemical methods) with diverse morphologies, nature of chemical dopants, induced defects and fundamental reaction parameters governing efficient photoinduced reactions are explored in this review. Further improvements in the photoefficiency of N-TiO 2 were achieved through co-doping with foreign ions, heterostructuring with other semiconductors, metal deposition and the tuning of N-TiO 2 with reactive exposed facets. The resultant improvement {{from each of the}} modification is discussed in the light of charge carrier generation-separation-transfer-recombination dynamics together with pollutant adsorption and their reactions with reactive oxygenated species in the liquid or gaseous regime. This review attempts to give an overview of the research highlights concerned with N-TiO 2. Although it is impossible to cover all of the research articles in the literature, several milestones in the pathway towards highly applicable N-TiO 2 are explored.

Both countries have focused their polar research more in the Antarctic than in the Arctic. Portugal and Spain should encourage research groups to continue increasing their collaborations with other countries and develop multi-disciplinary research projects, as well as to maintain highly activememberships within major organizations, such as the Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research (SCAR), the International Arctic Science Council (IASC) and the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS), and in international research projects. The work was supported by the Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (Portugal), including its Ciência program, by the Portuguese Polar Program PROPOLAR and by several grants, including the projects PTDC/MAR/ 099366 / 2008 and Pest-OE/MAR/UI 0331 / 2011.

40|$|Because of its {{sensitivity}} to unfavorable weather patterns, air pollution {{is sensitive to}} climate change so that, in the future, a climate penalty could jeopardize the expected efficiency of air pollution mitigation measures. A common method {{to assess the impact}} of climate on air quality consists in implementing chemistry-transport models forced by climate projections. However, the computing cost of such methods requires optimizing ensemble exploration techniques. By using a training data set from a deterministic projection of climate and air quality over Europe, we identified the main meteorological drivers of air quality for eight regions in Europe and developed statistical models that could be used to predict air <b>pollutant</b> concentrations. The <b>evolution</b> of the key climate variables driving either particulate or gaseous pollution allows selecting the members of the EuroCordex ensemble of regional climate projections that should be used in priority for future air quality projections (CanESM 2 /RCA 4; CNRM-CM 5 -LR/RCA 4 and CSIRO-Mk 3 - 6 - 0 /RCA 4 and MPI-ESM-LR/CCLM following the EuroCordex terminology). After having tested the validity of the statistical model in predictive mode, we can provide ranges of uncertainty attributed to the spread of the regional climate projection ensemble by the end of the century (2071 – 2100) for the RCP 8. 5. In the three regions where the statistical model of the impact of climate change on PM 2. 5 offers satisfactory performances, we find a climate benefit (a decrease of PM 2. 5 concentrations under future climate) of − 1. 08 (± 0. 21), − 1. 03 (± 0. 32), − 0. 83 (± 0. 14) µg m − 3, for respectively Eastern Europe, Mid-Europe and Northern Italy. In the British-Irish Isles, Scandinavia, France, the Iberian Peninsula and the Mediterranean, the statistical model is not considered skillful enough to draw any conclusion for PM 2. 5. In Eastern Europe, France, the Iberian Peninsula, Mid-Europe and Northern Italy, the statistical model of the impact of climate change on ozone was considered satisfactory and it confirms the climate penalty bearing upon ozone of 10. 51 (± 3. 06), 11. 70 (± 3. 63), 11. 53 (± 1. 55), 9. 86 (± 4. 41), 4. 82 (± 1. 79) µg m − 3, respectively. In the British-Irish Isles, Scandinavia and the Mediterranean, the skill of the statistical model was not considered robust enough to draw any conclusion for ozone pollution...|$|R
40|$|While not a high {{priority}} issue for most people, the public has long recognized the general importance of wetlands. Since President George H. W. Bush 2 ̆ 7 s campaign in 1988, successive administration have pledged to ensure there would be 2 ̆ 2 no net loss 2 ̆ 2 of wetlands. Despite these continuous presidential pledges to protect wetlands, in recent decades, {{as more and more}} people have moved to coastal and waterside properties, the economic benefits from developing wetlands (and political pressures on obstacles to development) have significantly increased. Seeking to mediate the conflict between no net loss of wetlands and development pressures, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) have employed a range of policy instruments to slow and reverse wetlands conversion. Through the 1970 s and 1980 s, the EPA and the Corps relied on prescriptive regulation that discouraged development of wetlands and, even if a permit for wetland filling were granted, required on-site mitigation of destroyed wetlands to ensure no net loss. To defuse the growing political pressure for substantial change to this 2 ̆ 2404 Permit 2 ̆ 2 process for developing wetlands, however, since the 1990 s the agencies and state governments have promoted a market mechanism that seeks to ensure wetlands conservation at minimum economic and political cost. This instrument is known as wetlands mitigation banking (WMB). In WMB, a 2 ̆ 2 bank 2 ̆ 2 of wetlands habitat is created, restored, or preserved and then made available to developers of wetlands habitat who must 2 ̆ 2 buy 2 ̆ 2 habitat mitigation as a condition of government approval for development. This mechanism has also provided a model for endangered species protection and {{is in the process of}} being extended to other settings including watershed protection. Given the shift in emphasis from prescriptive regulation to trading, the government 2 ̆ 7 s longstanding pursuit of no net loss of wetlands provides a particularly useful case study for comparing the use of regulatory and market instruments for environmental protection. Indeed, WMB provides a rare example of robust trading outside the air pollution context and the trading habitat-based goods raises very different concerns than seen in trading mobile <b>pollutants.</b> Examining the <b>evolution</b> of WMB also forces us to think carefully over how to assess the 2 ̆ 2 success 2 ̆ 2 of a trading program. The traditional measure would likely be efficiency. But one must also consider effectiveness. In this regards, WMB poses two different types of failures - failure of instrument design (a 2 ̆ 2 front-end 2 ̆ 2 problem) and failure of implementation through monitoring and enforcement (a 2 ̆ 2 back-end 2 ̆ 2 problem). As many of the case studies in this book illustrate, performance of WMB depends critically both on institutional design and implementation. Another important measure of success concerns distributional equity. Who wins and who loses from banking? Such concerns are far more difficult to assess as good or bad policy in habitat trading than the traditional 2 ̆ 2 hot spots 2 ̆ 2 of pollutant trading programs. The chapter ends by drawing out key lessons for market-based approaches to watershed protection...|$|R
