5000|$|Although {{the concept}} {{can also be}} {{executed}} through mail-order subscriptions, benefit events, and other methods, it is now often performed via Internet-mediated registries. This modern crowdfunding model is generally based on three types of actors: the <b>project</b> <b>initiator</b> who proposes the idea and/or project to be funded, individuals or groups who support the idea, and a moderating organization (the [...] "platform") that brings the parties together to launch the idea.|$|E

50|$|The {{consortium}} {{has been}} involved actively in initiatives that pioneer and advance new and usually untested technology. The consortium's main aim is to keep up a strategic role as a pilot <b>project</b> <b>initiator.</b> They usually influence and encourage innovation and driving progress in new areas of operation through grants, market access and other technical assistance. Although the name implies the geographic region of Singapore, the consortium is known to operate beyond its territory. As {{most members of the}} consortium are MNCs operating out of Singapore, CommerceNet Singapore follows its members to new markets regionally. This anomaly occurred as Singapore is known to host the 'operation headquarters' of many MNCs.|$|E
50|$|The JA2-Stracciatella project {{aims for}} cross {{platform}} capabilities for JA2 by porting the vanilla JA2 Wildfire source code to SDL as underlying library. Mac OS, Linux and Android and other source ports were released as result. Also, Stracciatella {{can be seen}} as an unofficial patch project, since the second focus is the fixing of technical errors (like Buffer overflows) and the removal of technical limitations without changing the game's balancing. The last commit of <b>project</b> <b>initiator</b> Tron in the project repository was r7072 from August 2010. In March 2013 the JA2-Stracciatella project was continued by another developer and transferred to a new repository. Support for higher resolutions and additional fixes were introduced.|$|E
5000|$|Jun: The Ministry of Finance {{indicated}} {{that it did not}} support the provision of preferences for project initiators which might affect tendering arrangements. The Ministry proposed a revision to the earlier (December 2011) presidential regulation to remove stipulations that provided preferences to firms which prepared feasibility studies for the bridge. Under the revised arrangements the government itself would finance the feasibility study so there would be no need to provide any special considerations for the <b>project</b> <b>initiator.</b> An editorial in The Jakarta Post noted that 'the finance minister's recommendation that the presidential decree be amended ... could save the project from becoming a potentially huge political and fiscal [...] "time bomb" [...] '.|$|E

40|$|Crowd {{science is}} {{scientific}} research that is {{conducted with the}} participation of volunteers who are not professional scientists. Thanks to the Internet and online platforms, <b>project</b> <b>initiators</b> can draw on a potentially large number of volunteers. This crowd can be involved to support data-rich or labour-intensive projects {{that would otherwise be}} unfeasible. So far, research on crowd science has mainly focused on analysing individual crowd science projects. In our research, we focus on the perspective of <b>project</b> <b>initiators</b> and explore how crowd science projects are set up. Based on multiple case study research, we discuss the objectives of crowd science projects and the strategies of their initiators for accessing volunteers. We also categorise the tasks allocated to volunteers and reflect on the issue of quality assurance as well as feedback mechanisms. With this article, we contribute {{to a better understanding of}} how crowd science projects are set up and how volunteers can contribute to science. We suggest that our findings are of practical relevance for initiators of crowd science projects, for science communication as well as for informed science policy making...|$|R

50|$|<b>Project</b> <b>initiator</b> Brian Paul was a {{graphics}} hobbyist. He {{thought it}} would be fun to implement a simple 3D graphics library using the OpenGL API, which he might then use instead of VOGL (very ordinary GL Like Library). Beginning in 1993, he spent eighteen months of part-time development before he released the software on the Internet. The software was well received, and people began contributing to its development. Mesa started off by rendering all 3D computer graphics on the CPU. Despite this, the internal architecture of Mesa was designed to be open for attaching to graphics processor-accelerated 3D rendering. In this first phase, rendering was done indirectly in the display server, leaving some overhead and noticeable speed lagging behind the theoretical maximum. The Diamond Monster 3D, using the Voodoo Graphics chipset, was one of the first 3D hardware devices supported by Mesa.|$|E
50|$|Ideas of FRUCT {{projects}} can be originated {{by university}} professors and industrial experts. In {{this case the}} <b>project</b> <b>initiator</b> takes obligation to be the project supervisor. Also undergraduate and PhD students can propose topics of new projects. Student proposals are reviewed and commented by FRUCT advisory board. The preference is given to proposals that have large R&D potential and project targeted in development of practical applications and innovative software-hardware solutions. For approved proposals FRUCT appoints supervisors and scientific advisors.Accepted FRUCT projects can apply for support to cover part of direct implementation expenses, e.g., traveling to conferences, books, purchases of hardware, etc. The best students are recommended {{to take part in}} various contests, grant and scholarship programs, etc.The project progress should be presented twice a year at FRUCT conferences. Project progress update consists of a report in form of conference paper, presentation and training or demo when applicable. As a result of each project at least one paper should be published in the proceedings of an international conference or journal. FRUCT conference has its own proceedings and the best papers from them are recommended for IEEE and journals publication. In addition, for papers accepted to publication in the recommended conferences, the main student author can apply for a grant to cover related travel expenses. Such travel grants are provided by FRUCT industrial members, e.g., Nokia Corporation.|$|E

[...] Based on Indonesian Presidential Regulation Number 86, dated 2 December 2011, the Lampung-Banten consortium with PT Bangungraha Sejahtera Mulia was appointed to be the <b>Project</b> <b>Initiator</b> to work on a feasibility study for the Sunda Strait Bridge Project and Strategic Area Development. Following the Presidential Regulation, Banten and Lampung provinces together with PT Bangun Sejahtera Mulia established a Joint Venture company called PT Graha Banten Lampung Sejahtera (GBLS) to conduct the Sunda Strait feasibility study. Based on its pre-feasibility study, Sunda Strait Project construction cost was estimated around US$10 billion and will take around 8 to 10 years to develop.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{influence}} of crowd funding knowledge, applica-tion, platform, and <b>project</b> <b>initiator</b> toward successful crowd funding.

Deployment and data collection take 3 month from October to December 2013. This study found evidence that crowd funding knowledge, crowd funding application, crowd funding platform, and <b>project</b> <b>initiator</b> has positive and significant relationship toward the success of crowd funding.
