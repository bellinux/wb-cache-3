40|$|As {{part of a}} {{collaborative}} research program between NASA Ames Research Center (ARC), NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC), and the US Army Laboratory, a series of experiments is being performed in GRC's 500 HP OH- 58 Transmission Test Rig facility and ARC's AH-I Cobra and OH- 58 c helicopters. The findings reported in this paper were drawn from Phase-I of a two-phase test-rig experiment, and {{are focused on the}} vibration response of an undamaged pinion gear operating in the transmission test rig. To simulate actual flight conditions, the transmission system was run at three torque levels, as well as two mast lifting and two mast bending levels. The test rig was also subjected to disassembly and reassembly of the main <b>pinion</b> <b>housing</b> to simulate the effect of maintenance operations. An analysis of variance based on the total power of the spectral distribution indicates the relative effect of each experimental factor, including Wong interactions with torque. Reinstallation of the main pinion assembly is shown to introduce changes in the vibration signature, suggesting the possibility of a strong effect of maintenance on HUMS design and use. Based on these results, further research will be conducted to compare these vibration responses with actual OH 58 c helicopter transmission vibration patterns...|$|E
50|$|Finally, (as {{described}} {{within the}} abstract for US Patent 5257535), if the mechanical system involves {{a right angle}} gearbox, then the axial reaction force experienced by the inputting shaft/pinion {{can be related to}} the torque experienced by the output shaft(s). The axial input stress must first be calibrated against the output torque. The input stress can be easily measured via strain gauge measurement of the input <b>pinion</b> bearing <b>housing.</b> The output torque is easily measured using a static torque meter.|$|R
50|$|The AAM 9.25 {{solid axle}} was {{developed}} for 3rd generation Dodge Rams (3/4 and 1 Ton). The axle uses a modified Saginaw 9.5 differential, ring and <b>pinion.</b> The differential <b>housing</b> covers are identical. Model year 2010 and later Rams use larger universal joints than the 2003-2009 models.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{right angle}} gear drive design where helical and spiral bevel gears are being used. Because of the high speed ratio (1800 / 18, input/output), three {{reductions}} were applied. Two helical gear sets {{were used in the}} first and second reductions (one each), and a spiral bevel set was used at the final reduction. The gears were mounted on four shafts, with the first and last shafts (output and input shafts) carrying one gear each straddle mounted, and the second and third shafts carrying two gears each, overhung mounted. The design was based on a criterion that was set for every element and was carried out in sequence; i. e. gears, shafts, bearings and housing. The high speed shaft and the bevel pinion shaft were made one piece with the <b>pinions.</b> The <b>housing</b> was made out of three parts: The main housing, which is to house the bevel gear set and to hold the oil; the high speed housing, which is to house the high speed helical gear set and support the high speed bearings; and the rear cover, which is to house the intermediate gear set (second reduction) ...|$|R
60|$|The door opened, and Sanson, {{the public}} executioner, came in. He carried the red smock worn by those convicted of assassination. She showed no dismay; no more, indeed, than a faint {{surprise}} that the time spent with Hauer should have gone so quickly. She begged {{for a few moments}} in which to write a note, and, the request being granted, acquitted herself briskly of that task, then announcing herself ready, she removed her cap that Sanson might cut her luxuriant hair. Yet first, taking his scissors, she herself cut off a lock and gave it to Hauer for remembrance. When Sanson would have bound her hands, she begged that she might be allowed to wear gloves, as her wrists were bruised and cut by the cord with which she had been <b>pinioned</b> in Marat's <b>house.</b> He answered that she might do so if she wished, but that it was unnecessary, as he could bind her without causing pain.|$|R
