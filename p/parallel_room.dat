50|$|An {{important}} aspect of the bunkers of the Siegfried Line was their ability to operate under gas attack. The bunkers could be hermetically sealed and supplied with purified air from outside. Because of their importance, the B-Werke had the most elaborate filter systems designed and built into the facilities. A constant overpressure prevented the penetration of gases in the event of minor leaks and allowed the removal of stale air and exhaust gases from the battle positions. One or more spaces were combined to form gas-tight cells. Pressure relief valves in the rooms or cells regulated the pressure. The air sucked in from outside was passed through a pre-filter, which cleared the air of dust and water vapour. Then it flowed through four, <b>parallel,</b> <b>room</b> filters, which filtered dangerous gasses out using active carbon inserts. If required, the air for heating the bunker could be warmed using a heat exchanger before being blown into the bunker. The capacity of the central fan was 40 m³ / minute. To ensure the ventilation of the plant even in the event of the central fan failing, individual rooms or cells had hand-operated HES ventilators (army unit protection ventilators) with 1.2 m³ or 2.4 m³ capacity per minute. The central fan and its filters was located above the engine room but is no longer in place.|$|E

After examination of sites in the Regio X, Germania Superior, Britannia and Tingitana it appears that the short parallel walls served as the foundation for floors aimed at the rapid storage of products brought in from the river, and, vice versa, for those destined to be loaded on to river boats that took part in the intense trade of the ports of Aquileia in the imperial period...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We develop {{algorithms}} for a stochastic two-machine single-server sequencing {{problem with}} waiting time, idle time and overtime costs. Scheduling surgeries {{for a single}} surgeon operating in two <b>parallel</b> operating <b>rooms</b> (ORs) motivates the work. The basic idea is that staff perform cleanup and setup in one OR while the surgeon is operating in the other. The benefit is less waiting time for the surgeon between surgeries, but may also result in added idle time for staff if cleanup and set-up are completed prior to completion of surgery in the other OR. When surgeries are long relative to cleanup and setup times, parallel OR scheduling is not attractive as significant OR staff idle time will result. The problem we address consists of assigning surgeries to ORs and sequencing them, and is formulated as an integer stochastic program using sample average approximation. A decomposition based solution approach is developed. Computational testing based on real data shows that the proposed methods solve the problems to optimality in acceptable processing times. Using the solution methodology, we further provide insight as to the conditions when <b>parallel</b> operating <b>rooms</b> is cost effective...|$|R

60|$|Parallel {{with the}} gallery, {{on both sides}} of the palace-court, there runs a series of rooms devoted chiefly to pictures, {{although}} statues and bas-reliefs are likewise contained in some of them. I remember an unfinished bas-relief by Michael Angelo of a Holy Family, which I touched with my finger, because it seemed as if he might have been at work upon it only an hour ago. The pictures I did little more than glance at, till I had almost completed again the circuit of the gallery, through this series of <b>parallel</b> <b>rooms,</b> and then I came upon a collection of French and Dutch and Flemish masters, all of which interested me more than the Italian generally. There was a beautiful picture by Claude, almost as good as those in the British National Gallery, and very like in subject; the sun near the horizon, of course, and throwing its line of light over the ripple of water, with ships at the strand, and one or two palaces of stately architecture on the shore. Landscapes by Rembrandt; fat Graces and other plump nudities by Rubens; brass pans and earthen pots and herrings by Terriers and other Dutchmen; none by Gerard Douw, I think, but several by Mieris; all of which were like bread and beef and ale, after having been fed too long on made dishes. This is really a wonderful collection of pictures; and from first, to last--from Giotto to the men of yesterday--they are in admirable condition, and may be appreciated for all the merit that they ever possessed.|$|R

Normally it was one more unused east wing room. However, when viewing it from outside the doorway, characters could see the Collins family members of another world. In that other Collinwood, the room was the private quarters of Angelique, {{who was the first}} wife of Quentin (the lord of the manor in this reality) and mother of Daniel (David). The inhabitants of that other reality were unaware that they were being observed (although Angelique and a few other Parallel Time characters saw into the “normal time” counterpart room occasionally).

40|$|Uvriježeno je mišljenje da je većina kanoničkih kurija na zagrebačkom Kaptolu nastala krajem 17. i tijekom 18. stoljeća, no istraživanjem gradevina, kao i proučavanjem arhivskih izvora moguće je pobliže odrediti ranije faze nastanka pojedinih prostora. Pozornost se pri izgradnji polagala na tlocrtnu zadanost uvjetovanu smještajem temelja podrumskih prostora na parceli. Iako gradene u dva barokna stoljeća, kurije Kaptol 20 i 24 svjedoče o snažnoj srednjovjekovnoj tradiciji. The {{construction}} of the first canonical houses in Kaptol corresponds with {{the foundation of the}} diocese. The earliest data of their construction were recorded in the Kaptol statutes dating back to 1334. At the time, the residences were made of wood, and the recent research has moved the beginnings of the {{construction of}} the first masonry houses back in time (the unveiling of two gothic stone portals of the residence at 26 Kaptol). The majority of the canonical residences were built in the late 17 th and during the 18 th centuries, and some of them contain parts of the earlier-day construction. This phenomenon is best witnessed by the cellars. Although the residences may have been wooden, their cellars were often built of solid materials. The earlier-day construction parts of the residences at 18, 22, and 25 Kaptol can be seen in some underground rooms, which differ {{from the rest of the}} building by the shape of the vaults and thickness of the walls. Two residences stand out from the others because of the layout of their cellars. The residence at Kaptol 20 was built in the 30 s of the 18 th century on the foundations of an older construction — i. e. on a "double" cellar which was mentioned in the 1687 visitations. The cross vault and the unique L-shaped ground plan point to the fact that the cellars are remains of an older construction which was probably destroyed in the 1731 fire. The residence at 24 Kaptol underwent major reconstruction in 1741 so that it would take extensive restoration works in order to display the parts of the original construction. The distinctive features of this cellar are its two <b>parallel</b> <b>rooms,</b> one of them shorter, narrower, and slightly concavely shaped with a barrel vault.

40|$|The post-breakage-integrity of BIPV module {{is the one}} of {{the most}} {{critical}} measurement for the approval of the use of BIPV module in buildings; especially for overhead-glazing application. Up to now, only laminated glass with PVBinterlayer is accepted as laminated safety glass in a regulated building product list. With respect to higher operating temperature and alternative interlayer materials used in PV laminated glass (BIPV-modules), therefore, the mechanical behaviours of PV laminated glass will be changed compared to conventional laminated glass. The aim of this paper is to examine post-breakage-integrity behaviour of eleven BIPV modules with different module configurations; glass types, operating temperatures, interlayer types of EVA and PVB, with- and without solar cells, interlayer thickness and glass thickness. For the test procedure, the PV module was damaged by striking with external mechanical load. The applied load and load duration are 500 N/m² over 24 hours by flexible sand bags. A 2 -side standard-conform line mounting was used. Due to different fracture behaviour of BIPV-laminated glass modules, two identical modules have been investigated in <b>parallel.</b> At <b>room</b> temperature, all specimens pass the test. Even PV module with glass-backsheet configuration is not allowed to be employed in overhead-glazing applications, it also passes the test. The glass configuration of heat-strengthened glass (TVG) has better behaviours compared to tempered safety glass (ESG), which is also in a good agreement with the regulation of DIN 18008. At high temperature, the trend of the results becomes negative compared to those at room temperature. There is no difference between EVA and PVB interlayers in PV modules without solar cell. The solar cells with certain interlayers could have a positive result. PV modules with thinner glass thickness could also pass the test, even though the stiffness of thinner laminated glasses is lower compared to that of thicker laminated glass...|$|R

It was found that diffuse s-layers, which are due to weak lateral correlations of the guest molecules, are not sharp <b>parallel</b> c* at <b>room</b> temperature as assumed previously, but show a broadening of their widths with increasing order. With decreasing temperature the widths of the s-layers decrease and become sharp within the resolution limit at very low temperature, i. e. there is an ordering of the guest molecules along the urea host tunnels. The modulations of the s-layers point towards a lateral correlation of the guest molecules at room temperature which can be described by a box-shaped distribution function. A model is described which explains the existence of (numerous) satellite reflections and satellite s-layers at low temperatures. Some of the satellites are also observable at room temperature in inclusion compounds with guest molecules longer than tetradecane.

40|$|Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) {{emitted from}} uses such as {{refrigerants}} and thermal insulating foam, {{are now the}} fastest growing greenhouse gases (GHGs), with global warming potentials (GWP) thousands of times higher than carbon dioxide (CO 2). Because of the short lifetime of these molecules in the atmosphere, mitigating the amount of these short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) provides a faster path to climate change mitigation than control of CO 2 alone. This has led to proposals from Africa, Europe, India, Island States, and North America to amend the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (Montreal Protocol) to phase-down high-GWP HFCs. Simultaneously, energy efficiency market transformation programs such as standards, labeling and incentive programs are endeavoring to improve the energy efficiency for refrigeration and air conditioning equipment to provide life cycle cost, energy, GHG, and peak load savings. In this paper we provide {{an estimate of the}} magnitude of such GHG and peak electric load savings potential, for room air conditioning, if the refrigerant transition and energy efficiency improvement policies are implemented either separately or in parallel. We find that implementing HFC refrigerant transition and energy efficiency improvement policies in <b>parallel</b> for <b>room</b> air conditioning, roughly doubles the benefit of either policy implemented separately. We estimate that shifting the 2030 world stock of room air conditioners from the low efficiency technology using high-GWP refrigerants to higher efficiency technology and low-GWP refrigerants in parallel would save between 340 - 790 gigawatts (GW) of peak load globally, which is roughly equivalent to avoiding 680 - 1550 peak power plants of 500 MW each. This would save 0. 85 GT/year annually in China equivalent to over 8 Three Gorges dams and over 0. 32 GT/year annually in India equivalent to roughly twice India’s 100 GW solar mission target. While there is some uncertainty associated with emissions and growth projections, moving to efficient room air conditioning (~ 30 % more efficient than current technology) in parallel with low-GWP refrigerants in room air conditioning could avoid up to ~ 25 billion tonnes of CO 2 in 2030, ~ 33 billion in 2040, and ~ 40 billion in 2050, i. e. cumulative savings up to 98 billion tonnes of CO 2 by 2050. Therefore, superefficient room ACs using low-GWP refrigerants merit serious consideration to maximize peak load reduction and GHG savings...|$|R

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{pressure}} exchanger, or wave rotor, in an air-cycle air conditioner is examined {{as an alternative to}} vapor-compression cycles which use chloroflourocarbons (CFC's), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC's) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFC's). In {{a pressure}} exchanger, expansion and normal shock waves are the mechanisms which transfer energy from a high pressure gas, by expanding it, to a low pressure gas, by compressing it. The device consists of a rotor which is divided into cells and a stator end-plate which controls inflow and outflow. A one-dimensional, homentropic unsteady numerical model was developed using the method of characteristics to simulate the flow through one cell. By entering the inlet and outlet pressures, the locations of the high pressure inlet and outlet ports and the low pressure inlet and outlet ports are calculated based on flow conditions. The mass flow rate through the system {{and the size of the}} rotor are also determined. Besides the pressure exchanger, an air-to-air heat exchanger and air compressor are necessary to develop an air conditioning cycle. These components can be arranged into six configurations of which two are superior to the rest. One configuration consists of the pressure exchanger and compressor working in <b>parallel</b> to raise <b>room</b> air to a higher pressure and temperature so that the heat can be transferred outside. In the other configuration, room air is compressed in stages, first by the pressure exchanger and then by the compressor with heat exchangers located after each compression stage. Six configurations of these components can provide cooling. Three involve expanding outside air below atmospheric pressure to absorb heat from the cooled space. These are not practical because of variability due to outside ambient humidity, high outlet temperatures for cool air to prevent frosting, and high volumetric flow rates of air. Of the three systems which compress room air to extract energy, the configuration with the pressure exchanger and compressor operating in parallel exhibited slightly better performance than the two configurations where the pressure exchanger and compressor compress the air in series...|$|R

The secondary outcome measure was overall treatment failure (acute treatment failure and relapse). Randomization was carried out in 390 patients before enrollment was suspended on the advice of the independent data safety monitoring board due to significant differences in both primary and secondary outcome measures in the two arms and the attainment of a priori defined endpoints. Median (95 % confidence interval) fever clearance times were 92 hours (84 - 114 hours) for gatifloxacin recipients and 138 hours (105 - 164 hours) for cefixime-treated patients (Hazard Ratio[95 %CI] = 2. 171 [1. 545 - 3. 051], p< 0. 0001). 19 out of 70 (27 %) patients who completed the 7 day trial had acute clinical failure in the cefixime group as compared to 1 out of 88 patients (1 %) in gatifloxacin group(Odds Ratio [95 %CI] = 0. 031 [0. 004 - 0. 237], p< 0. 001).

HISP 711 final project 2012. The early twentieth century {{was a period of}} rapid growth and social change in America. The daily lives of women in particular were transformed due to increased rights and accessibility to public spaces. Thus, a new type of room developed for the exclusive use of women. Called a ladies’ rest room, these public rooms were originally established {{in the late nineteenth century}} to give women a designated space to rest, care for their children, and socialize with other women, in a town or city setting of mostly male-dominated, public spaces. Although the operation of ladies’ rest rooms continued throughout the 1920 s and early 1930 s, by the late 1930 s the use of these rooms declined and fewer examples are found. As the need for segregated spaces for women declined, the rooms once used as ladies’ rest rooms typically assumed other functions. Consequently, little is known about the existence of these rooms today. The study of ladies’ rest rooms can inform our understanding of the changing dynamics of gender roles during the early twentieth century. Therefore, this paper explores the ladies’ rest room using a systematic approach to understand their development and decline at a time of great social change. To understand the evolution of these spaces, I created a typology based on the room’s location, function, and time period of use. This typology draws on a preliminary survey of ladies’ rest rooms using evidence from various historical newspapers, publications, and other primary sources. The typology forms the basis for an analysis of the ways in which the evolution of the ladies’ rest <b>rooms</b> <b>parallels</b> social changes in American society during the early twentieth century. The paper concludes with an assessment of how ladies’ rest rooms demonstrate that preservationists should look more closely at the evolution of interior spaces...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} {{of the ways in which}} a number of important Russian writers and filmmakers of the 1910 s and 1920 s appropriated domestic interiors as structural, visual and literary metaphors. My focus is on the artistic articulation of the closed space of the Russian domestic interior, in particular as it surfaced in the narratives of the modernist literature and cinema of the time and became an essential metaphor of its age. In my discussion I take issue with two standard ways of understanding domestic space in existing literature. I argue that representations of home spaces in early twentiethcentury Russian culture mount a challenge to the conventional view of the home as a place of safety and stability. I also argue that, at this point, the traditional approach to the room and the domestic space as a fixed closed structure is assailed by representations that see domestic space as kinetic. The importance of the 'room in motion' means that I address cinematic as well as literary representations of domestic space, and show that even literary representation borrow cinematic techniques. My different chapters constitute case studies of various separate, but complementary, aspects of the representation of home space. The first chapter shows how domestic space in reflected in the poetical language of Anna Akhmatova. The second chapter focuses on the <b>parallel</b> exploration of <b>rooms</b> and a child's consciousness in Kotik Letaev by Andrei Belyi. The third chapter discovers the philosophy of a room built by Sigizmund Krzhizhanovskii in his short stories of the 1920 s. The next three chapters focus on interiors of three different cinematic genres. The fourth chapter looks closely at films created by Evgenii Bauer, showing the director's innovative techniques of framing and set-design. The fifth chapter explores the film Tret'ia Meshchanskaia by Abram Room, focusing on the director's employment of the room as a structural device of the film. The last chapter analyses two lyrical comedies by Boris Barnet to show the comic effect produced by the empty room and domestic objects in his films, and also focuses on the image of staircase. In conclusion, I speculate that the representation of interior spaces in the period in question goes beyond genre, medium, and narrative structure and becomes an important and culturally dynamic motif of the time. </p...|$|R
