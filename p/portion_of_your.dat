This drew the attention of Rudyard Kipling, who produced [...] "The Absent-Minded Beggar" [...] on 16 October 1899 and sent the verses to Harmsworth on 22 October with a note that [...] "they are at your service. ... turn [...] over {{to any one of}} the regularly ordained relief-funds, as a <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> contribution. I don't want my name mixed up in the business except as it will help to get money. It's catchpenny verse and I want it to catch just as many pennies as it can. ... It isn't a thing I shall care to reprint; so there is no need of copyrighting it in America. If any one wants to sing it take care that the proceeds go to our men." [...] It was first published in the Daily Mail on 31 October 1899 and was an immediate success. Maud Tree, the wife of actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree, recited it at the Palace Theatre, every night before the show, for fourteen months, and other performers recited it at music halls and elsewhere, giving part of the profits to the fund. The manuscript itself was auctioned for £500, and a Special Edition de Luxe was issued.|$|E

Is the visual system capable of supporting conscious perception at these locations? Experiment One We use a strong flash with dark-adapted subjects, which induces a vivid, long-lasting positive afterimage that appears after a brief delay. Experiment is in complete darkness. Fixation cues are based on texture and proprioceptive cues. 1. Subject fixates straight forward. 2. Strong flash (4 x 2400 W) illuminates a grid stimulus 3. Subject changes fixation to lower point. 4. Afterimage emerges. 5. Subject verbally reports appearance of grid afterimage, including {{the location of the}} lowest visible bar In control trials, fixation does not shift...|$|R

40|$|In {{part one}} of this series on Ajax we looked at Ajax basics. What it is. How it works. Where it executes. We learned that Ajax {{communication}} (in its most basic form) only takes a few lines of JavaScript to work. If Ajax is so easy, what’s all the fuss about Ajax being so hard? Even though Ajax in its purest sense just defines a method for communicating asynchronously with the server, it is relatively useless unless you do something with the information returned from the server. That “something ” usually means {{that you need to}} update <b>portions</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> web page with new HTML. And unlike Ajax communication, updating the page with new HTML after an Ajax callback is far from easy, especially when implemented in generic Ajax framework. In this installment, we’ll look at what it takes to update a page after an Ajax callback and what frameworks like RadAjax and ASP. NET Ajax do to make the process very easy for developers. Document Object Model (DOM) Just as JavaScript and the XMLHttpRequest are critical for Ajax communication, the ability to manipulate the browser’s document object model (or DOM) is critical for Ajax page updates. Most modern browsers support a standard interface to manipulate the browser’s DOM that can be programmed using JavaScript. There is nothing special about the JavaScript written for Ajax DOM updates (vs. any othe...|$|R
