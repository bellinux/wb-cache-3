Both stations are exposed daily for more than one hour and are situated in the <b>polyhaline</b> and the mesohaline zone of the estuary. Average density data of non-selective deposit-feeders > predators > epigrowth-feeders > selective deposit-feeders for both stations are presented in spite of different nematode species composition. No difference between Spring and Autumn nor trend over 7 years could be detected. Higher total nematode densities are found at the <b>polyhaline</b> station (average 3200 ind. 10 cm - 2) in comparison with the mesohaline station (average 2300 ind. 10 cm - 2), a difference mainly due to higher non-selective deposit-feeders and predators densities in the <b>polyhaline</b> station. Each year, heterogeneous variance is found for all feeding types at the mesohaline station, but only for epigrowth-feeders and predators at the <b>polyhaline</b> station. The higher nematode density at the <b>polyhaline</b> station is probably caused by the more stable nematode structure. An unstable nematode temporal pattern at the mesohaline station is suggested to be combined with the detritus food chain system in the mesohaline zone.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{differences in}} the transit times of dissolved substances through salinity zones in the Altamaha and Ogeechee River estuaries under a range of flow conditions. Salinity distributions and transit times were estimated from box models generated using the SqueezeBox modeling framework. The estuaries were compared {{in spite of the}} large difference in their river flow ranges by using flow rates ranging from the 10 th- 90 th percentile within each range. In each case, zone lengths and transit times were calculated for the tidal freshwater, oligo-mesohaline, and <b>polyhaline</b> zones. Although the two estuaries have similar lengths, the slower-flowing Ogeechee grades from a zone of tidal freshwater (except at very low flows) through oligo-mesohaline zones to a <b>polyhaline</b> zone inside the mouth whereas the Altamaha always has a fairly long (> 25 km) extent of tidal freshwater but only a short (or non-existent) <b>polyhaline</b> zone. Transit times through the whole Ogeechee estuary are 3. 3 - 4. 7 times longer than those in the Altamaha, but the lengths of time water spends in the tidal freshwater reaches of the estuaries are comparable whereas there are large {{differences in the}} times spent in oligo-mesohaline and <b>polyhaline</b> reaches.

40|$|Elimination {{kinetics}} of six tetra-, penta- and hexachlorobiphenyls {{were investigated}} in Nereis diversicolor from two {{populations of the}} Weser Estuary by laboratory experiments. Elimination half-lives increased in the order 101, 52, 87, 44, 95, 153 (IUPAC Nos.) indicating the importance of PCB structure. At appropriate salinities, 10 ppt and 25 ppt, ragworms from the possibly more contaminated mesohaline site eliminated these components considerably faster than those from the <b>polyhaline</b> site. Worms from the mesohaline site also had considerably more polar transformation products of No. 52, which had been applied super(14) C-labelled. This indicates that the faster PCB elimination in this population was generally due to increased biotransformation.

40|$|Nitrogen (N) {{removal from}} {{estuaries}} is driven {{in part by}} sedimentary microbial processes. The processes of denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) remove N from estuaries by producing di-nitrogen gas, and each can be coupled to N recycling pathways such as nitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). Environmental conditions in estuaries influence sedimentary N cycling processes; therefore, seawater intrusion may affect the coupling of N cycling processes in the freshwater portions of estuaries. This study investigated the potential effects of seawater intrusion on these process couplings through a comparative modeling approach. We applied environ analysis, a form of ecological network analysis, to two N cycling mass-balance network models constructed at freshwater (oligohaline) and saltwater (<b>polyhaline)</b> sites in the Cape Fear River Estuary, North Carolina. We used a space-for-time substitution to predict the effects of seawater intrusion on the sedimentary N cycle. Further, we conducted an uncertainty analysis using linear inverse modeling to evaluate the effects of parameterization uncertainty on model results. Nitrification coupled to both denitrification and anammox was 2. 5 times greater in the oligohaline model, while DNRA coupled to anammox was 2. 7 times greater in the <b>polyhaline</b> model. However, {{the total amount of}} N 2 gas produced relative to the nitrogen inputs to each network was 4. 7 % and 4. 6 % at the oligohaline and <b>polyhaline</b> sites, respectively.

40|$|The {{economic}} value of flounder from shore angling around Ireland was assessed. Flounder catches from shore angling tournaments around Ireland {{were related to}} domestic and overseas shore angling expenditure {{in order to determine}} an {{economic value}} for the species. Temporal trends in flounder angling catches, and specimen (trophy) flounder reports were also investigated. Flounder was found to be the most caught shore angling species in competitions around Ireland constituting roughly one third of the shore angling competition catch although this did vary by area. The total value of flounder from shore angling tourism was estimated to be of the order of € 8. 4 million. No significant temporal trends in flounder angling catches and specimen reports were found. Thus there is no evidence from the current study for any decline in flounder stocks. The population dynamics of 0 -group flounder during the early benthic stage was investigated at estuarine sites in Galway Bay, west of Ireland. Information was analysed from the March to June sampling period over five years (2002 to 2006). Spatial and temporal variations in settlement and population length structure were analysed between beach and river habitats and sites. Settlement of flounder began from late March to early May of each year, most commonly in April. Peak settlement was usually in April or early May. Settlement was recorded earlier than elsewhere, although most commonly was similar to {{the southern part of the}} UK and northern France. Settlement was generally later in tidal rivers than on sandy beaches. Abundance of 0 -group flounder in Galway Bay did not exhibit significant inter -annual variability. 0 -group flounder were observed in dense aggregations of up to 105 m' 2, which were patchy in distribution. Highest densities of 0 -group flounder were recorded in limnetic and oligohaline areas as compared with the lower densities in <b>polyhaline</b> and to a lesser extent mesohaline areas. Measurements to of salinity allowed the classification of beaches, and tidal river sections near the mouth, into a salinity based scheme for length comparisons. Beaches were classified as polyhaline,the lower section of rivers as mesohaline, and the middle and upper sections as oligohaline. Over the March to June sampling period 0 -group flounder utilised different sections at different length ranges and were significantly larger in more upstream sections. During initial settlement in April, 0 -group flounder of 8 - 10 mm (standard length, SL) were present in abundance on <b>polyhaline</b> sandy beaches. By about 10 mm (SL), flounder were present in all <b>polyhaline,</b> mesohaline and (oligohaline) sections. 0 -group flounder became absent or in insignificant numbers in <b>polyhaline</b> and mesohaline sections in a matter of weeks after first appearance. From April to June, 0 -group flounder of 12 - 30 mm (SL) were found in more upstream locations in the oligohaline sections. About one month (May or June) after initial settlement, 0 -group flounder became absent from the oligohaline sections. Concurrently, flounder start to reappear in mesohaline and <b>polyhaline</b> areas at approximately 30 mm (SL) in June. The results indicate 0 -group flounder in the early benthic stage are associated with low salinity areas, but as they grow, this association diminishes.

In this broad-scale study, a large data set (3112 samples) of the Schelde estuary allowed a thorough analysis of these gradients, and to relate macrobenthic species distributions and community structure to salinity, depth, current velocities and sediment characteristics. Univariate analyses clearly revealed distinct gradients in diversity, abundance, and biomass along the vertical and longitudinal gradients. In general, highest diversity and biomass were observed in the intertidal, <b>polyhaline</b> zone and decreased with decreasing salinity. Abundance did not show clear trends and varied between spring and autumn. In all regions, very low values for all measures were observed in the subtidal depth strata. Abundance in all regions was dominated by both surface deposit feeders and sub-surface deposit feeders. In contrast, the biomass of the different feeding guilds showed clear gradients in the intertidal zone.

P. australis populations were selected along the salinity gradient in the estuary, including limnetic (salinity 0. 05 %), oligohaline (0. 4 %) and <b>polyhaline</b> sections (2. 5 %). The ratio of Total-P/Total-N of river water showed high values in the oligohaline section and the above ground biomass, population height and culm diameter of P. australis showed maximum values in this section. Sufficient phosphorus supply could sustain the high productivity of the community in the oligohaline section, irrespective of the salinity of inun-dated water. The seed production of P. australis was lowest in the <b>polyhaline</b> section.

It is the first mangrove forest in the world which has been brought under scientific management since 1982, thereafter no apparent forest harvest and catastrophic disturbance have occurred. As recently as 200  years ago the Sundarbans extended across most of southwestern Bangladesh (Islam 2001).

Chaffey et al. (1985) divided the Sundarbans mangrove forest into three ecological zones viz. fresh water (Oligohaline), moderately saline water (Mesohaline) and salt water (<b>Polyhaline)</b> zones.

The spatial {{occurrence of the}} benthic macrofauna along the salinity gradient, including the freshwater tidal area was emphasized. Both estuaries appeared {{to have a very}} similar species composition, especially at genus level. The higher number of species observed in the Schelde estuary was probably due to a greater habitat diversity. In both estuaries species diversity decreased with distance upstream. The total density did not vary along the estuarine gradient, whereas biomass is highest in the <b>polyhaline</b> zone. In both estuaries distinct intertidal benthic communities were observed along the salinity gradient: a marine community in the <b>polyhaline</b> zone, a brackish community in the mesohaline zone, and a third community in the oligohaline and freshwater tidal zones of the estuary. These three communities were very similar between both estuaries. Their main characteristics were discussed together with the occurrence and distribution of the dominant species. For the Schelde estuary {{and to a lesser extent}} also for the Ems estuary, there was evidence that anthropogenic stress had a negative effect on the intertidal macrobenthic communities of the oligohaline/freshwater tidal zone. Only Oligochaeta were dominating, whereas the very euryhaline and/or true limnetic species were missing. In the mesohaline zone, the Schelde estuary was dominated by large numbers of short-living, opportunistic species, whereas in the Ems estuary relatively more stable macrobenthic communities were observed.

Morphology of all larval (4 zoeae, 1 megalopa) {{and the first}} two juvenile stages was studied microscopically and described in detail. These results were compared with an available (but much less detailed) morphological description of larval E. limosum from the North Atlantic (KURATA et al. 1981), {{in order to find}} possibly existing geographical variation and to provide additional details. Conspicuous morphological differences were found in the spinulation of the antennal exopods (zoea II), in the setation of maxillipeds 1 and 2 (zoea III), and in setation of the carapace (zoea IV). Cultivation experiments were conducted at four different salinities (15, 20, 25, 32 S) and a constant temperature (25 °C). Conditions with <b>polyhaline</b> water (25 S) were optimum, resulting in maximum survival. Lower salinities (* 20 S) and seawater (32 S) were also tolerated quite well by all four zoeal stages. In contrast, the megalopa showed a less euryhaline response, with clearly highest survival at 25 S. While salinity exerted in general strong effects on larval survi-val rate, development duration showed only exceptionally a conspicuous response: 15 S caused statistically significant delays in the zoea I and III stages, and the zoea II developed significantly faster at 25 S than in all other salinities tested.

Total biomass of the protozoans studied, integrated over the upper 4 cm of the sediment, ranged from 41 to 597 mg C m - 2 {{and was in the}} same order of magnitude at the <b>polyhaline</b> and the freshwater intertidal site. Nanoheterotrophs were the dominant protozoans, in terms of both abundance and biomass. Ciliate abundances appeared to be largely determined by physical constraints, namely, the amount of interstitial space and hydrodynamic disturbances.

Salinity differences were clearly reflected in the protozoan community composition. The dominant role of sessile ciliates is a unique feature of sediments in the freshwater tidal reaches, which {{can be attributed to the}} dynamic nature of sedimentation and resuspension processes associated with the maximum turbidity zone.

Specific objectives were to identify the frequency, magnitude, and nature of differences in assessment of Chesapeake Bay sites as ‘degraded ’ or ‘undegraded ’ by the indices. A dataset of 275 subtidal samples taken in 2003 from Chesapeake Bay were used in this comparison.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Monthly {{samples of}} nutrients, {{phytoplankton}} and zooplankton {{were taken in}} the Columbia River estuary {{over a period of}} 16 months in order to determine distribution with season and salinity, and interrelationships between plankton and nutrients. Nitrate and phosphate levels in the river water entering the estuary are high in the winter and show depletion during the summer. Silicate levels are high in the river water at all seasons. Nitrate and phosphate levels are high in the entering ocean water during summer offshore upwelling. The nutrient levels in the estuary generally show a linear relationship with salinity, resulting from the levels of nutrients in the entering river and ocean water. Superimposed upon this linear relationship is a tendency for the nutrients to be enriched in the bottom waters of {{the central part of the}} estuary. The estuary phytoplankton are primarily composed of freshwater forms, and probably represent a downstream extension of the river flora.

The environmental factors salinity and the particle size reflect an estuarine gradient. The Nematode and macrobenthos densities and assemblages composition change along the gradient, establishing homogenous sections: (i) the tidal and oligohaline sections are characterised by the presence of freshwater nematodes, the total densities and diversity reach the minimum values; macrobenthos is dominated by Gammarus, Chironomidae and Corbicula fluminae;(ii) in the mesohaline sections the nematode densities is lower and the diversity is poor, the dominant genera are Terschellingia and Sabatieira, Daptonema and Anoplostoma; macrobenthos is dominated by Corophium orientale, Leptocheirus pilosus and Ciathura carinata; (iii) in the <b>polyhaline</b> and euhaline sections the total densities and the diversity are higher, and the Nematode dominant genera are Paracomesoma and Synonchiella; the macrobenthic Heteromastus filiformes, C. orientale and Hediste diversicole are present in the <b>polyhaline</b> section While in the euhaline section the species Nephtys hombergii and Maldanidae are exclusive...|$|E
40|$|Halophilic mycobiota was {{isolated}} from Mandovi estuary {{and it was}} dominated by Aspergillus and Penicillium species. Cladosporium and Eurotium were found in lesser numbers while obligate halophiles were found only amongst the aspergilla {{and they were all}} identified as Aspergillus penicillioides. Some aspergilli and all the isolates of Penicillium, Cladosporium and Eurotium were facultative halophiles. There were significant differences in growth of each isolate at different salt concentrations. Most of the isolates were euryhaline, having a wide range of salt tolerance; a few were stenohaline, with a narrow range of halotolerance. The isolates were mainly moderate halophiles, with a very few slight halophiles. Isolation of obligate halophilic fungi from <b>polyhaline</b> environment of an estuary is hereby reported for the first time...|$|E
40|$|The Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (B-IBI) was {{developed}} and is currently employed for environmental assessment in Chesapeake Bay. The index consists {{of a variety of}} benthic community metrics (e. g. abundance, biomass, diversity, stress tolerance groups, etc.) scored by thresholds applied to seven benthic community habitats (tidal freshwater, oligohaline, low mesohaline, high mesohaline mud, high mesohaline sand, <b>polyhaline</b> mud, and <b>polyhaline</b> sand) This index was verified as being a sensitive and robust tool for summarizing the status of benthic communities. In our study we tested the classification efficiency of the index using new benthic data by characterizing each sample a priori as degraded or undegraded using criteria of sediment contaminant levels, bioassays and bottom dissolved oxygen levels. A primary objective of our study was to test the classification efficiency of the B-IBI in small water bodies connected to larger water bodies of the mainstems of the large rivers of Chesapeake Bay, as well as the efficiency of the index over time (1990 through 2009). The B-IBI was affected {{by the size of the}} water body, e. g., index accuracy was higher for water bodies in small watersheds in lower salinity habitats, whereas large water bodies of the mainstem of rivers were better classified by the B-IBI in habitats with higher salinities. Across the seven benthic habitat types overall correct classification was moderate to low and lower for correctly classifying undegraded sites. In general the index metrics showed some deficiencies that suggest improvements could be made by recalibrating existing metric thresholds or selecting new suitable metrics.

40|$|Aspergillus penicillioides {{is a true}} halophile, {{present in}} diverse econiches – from the hypersaline athalassohaline and thalassohaline environments, to <b>polyhaline</b> systems, and in {{different}} geographical locations. Twenty seven isolates from these environments, were seen to be moderate halophiles, euryhaline in nature. They had an obligate need of a low aw and were unable to grow on a regular defined medium such as Czapek Dox Agar, {{as well as on}} varied nutrient rich agar media such as Malt Extract, Potato Dextrose and Sabouraud Agar; however, growth was obtained on all these media when amended with 10 % solar salt. In absence of added salt, the conidia either did not germinate, or when germinated, distortions and lysis were seen in the short mycelial forms; on media with salt, the mycelia and vesicles appeared normal...|$|E
40|$|A {{stratified}} {{study of}} microhabitat use by grey mullet {{on the island}} of Minorca (Balearic archipelago, western Mediterranean) showed that the distribution of all the species was dramatically affected by salinity. Sites with a salinity level under 15 were positively selected in spring and summer by those species whose growth performance was the best in oligomesohaline water (Liza ramado and Mugil cephalus) but also by a species whose growth was not affected by salinity (Chelon labrosus). Liza aurata concentrated in <b>polyhaline</b> and euhaline sites, where growth was improved, a pattern also exhibited by Liza saliens. Both species avoided fresh water sites all year round. As a consequence, community structure was correlated with salinity. The above reported electivity patterns often disappeared in autumn, when most grey mullets migrate off-shore...|$|E
30|$|Water {{temperature}} and salinity were measured using a T-S meter (Model 30, YSI, Yellow Springs, OH, USA) {{from the surface}} to the bottom at 1 -m intervals. To measure the Chl a concentration, 1, 000 ml of seawater was collected from the surface layer once during each sampling. Chl a was extracted by grinding the filter paper {{in a dark room}} and placing it in 90 % acetone, as recommended by SCOR-UNESCO (1980). The extracted sample was centrifuged, and the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 750, 664, 647, and 630 nm using a spectrophotometer (UNICAM Helios Alpha, Gloucester, UK). Water column conditions for each sample were designated as oligohaline (0 to 5 practical salinity unit (psu)), mesohaline (5 to 18 psu), and <b>polyhaline</b> (> 18 psu) on the basis of Ekman's classification system (Day et al. 1989).|$|E

30|$|This is {{the first}} report of net primary {{productivity}} of the Sundarbans Mangrove forest, Bangladesh. The present stand had above-ground biomass of 154.8  Mg∙ha− 1 ∙yr− 1, and above-ground net primary production {{during the study period}} was estimated to be 17.2  Mg∙ha− 1 ∙yr− 1. Those values were lower to those of AGB (159  Mg∙ha− 1 ∙yr− 1) and AGNPP (27  Mg∙ha− 1 ∙yr− 1) for R. apiculata dominated mangrove forest at Southern Thailand (Christensen 1978). Our estimates of AGNPP (17.2  Mg∙ha− 1 ∙yr− 1) were near {{the high end of the}} range of values reported in mangrove forests at Florida, USA (8.1 – 26.1  Mg∙ha− 1 ∙yr− 1; Ross et al. 2001). The present value of NPP was higher than those reported for R. apiculata dominated forest at Matang mangrove forest, Malaysia (17.7  Mg∙ha− 1 ∙yr− 1; Putz and Chan 1986). The study area is located in the oligohaline zone of the Sundarbans mangrove forest and the area is flushed frequently by tides that may cause higher NPP of this mangroves. Similar findings were observed by Day et al. (1989), who reported that mangrove forest flushed frequently by tides and exposed to high nutrient concentrations have higher net primary production. There are three ecological zones in the Sundarbans such as oligohaline, mesohaline, and <b>polyhaline</b> zone based on the degree of salinity and floristic composition. The floristics composition of Sundarbans is defined by the distribution of three species: H. fomes, E. agallocha, and C. decandra. All three species occur throughout the Sundarbans but in different proportions depending on salinity. H. fomes is the characteristics of the oligohaline zone, E. agallocha of the mesohaline zone, and C. decandra of the <b>polyhaline</b> zone (Rahman and Islam 2015). Depending on the site of mangroves along the salinity gradient of an estuary and with distance inland from the shore, the properties of mangrove communities vary within an environmental setting (Chen and Twilley 1999). So in the present study, mangrove communities in the oligohaline zone may have higher productivity and turnover than other ecological zones of Sundarbans, Bangladesh.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we studied some {{ecological}} factors and the floral composition of phytoplankton (micro plankton) during the 1953 - 1954 period. We measured successively: the temperature, the pH, the alkaline, the chlorine, the dissolved oxygen, {{the concentration of}} phosphates and nitrates. The water of the Ostend port passes the scale a-mesohaline to <b>polyhaline.</b> The sampling of the phytoplankton has been worked out one time or several times in a month. The Bacillariophyceae play an important role, the Dinophyceae are relatively rare, as the Chryosophyceae, and the Chlorophyceae are meeting during the whole year, {{with the exception of}} January, February and April, in little quantities, except for November. Dominant species are: Coscinodiscus continues, Biddulphia alternans, Coscinodiscus subtilis, Biddulphia regia, Asterionella japonica, Rhizosolenia setigaria, Biddulphia regia, Actinoptychus undulatus, Biddulphia Favus, Melosira Borreri.
