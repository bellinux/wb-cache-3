50|$|The {{negative}} effects from FOD {{can be reduced}} or entirely eliminated by introducing compressive residual stresses in critical fatigue areas into the part during the manufacturing process. These beneficial stresses are induced into the part through cold working the part with <b>peening</b> processes: shot <b>peening,</b> or laser <b>peening.</b> The deeper the compressive residual stress the more significant the fatigue life and damage tolerance improvement. Shot <b>peening</b> typically induces compressive stresses a few thousandths of an inch deep, laser <b>peening</b> typically imparts compressive residual stresses 0.040 to 0.100 inches deep. Laser <b>peen</b> induced compressive stresses are also more resistant to heat exposure.|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{within the}} {{aviation}} industry {{there has been}} a large focus on enhancing the fatigue life of thin-walled aircraft structures, such as the fuselage. In the past decades, shot <b>peening</b> was seen to aid in accomplishing this goal. In more modern and recent times, laser shock <b>peening</b> techniques were said to provide a more substantial improvement to the treated material, in comparison to shot <b>peening.</b> Laser shock <b>peening</b> relies on a more focused and precise <b>peening</b> process, whereas shot <b>peening</b> utilised a multitude of shots (small spherical metal/plastic/glass beads) which are projected towards a material surface (via a high pressure), which randomly impacts the material surface to create compressive residual stresses and thus improve fatigue life. Samples of AA 6056 -T 4 Aluminium alloy used for integral structures, with a thickness of 3. 2 mm were used to represent a thin-walled component. These were used for comparative testing of material properties after Laser Shock <b>Peening</b> and Shot <b>peening</b> had been executed on the test pieces. The material properties investigated were material deflection, surface roughness, micro-hardness and residual stresses at various laser intensities and shot <b>peening</b> pressures. Laser shock <b>peening</b> had shown the best results, with higher deflections between 2. 12 to 3 times higher than shot <b>peening,</b> a smoother surface finish (roughness values 2 - 2. 5 times less than shot <b>peening),</b> deeper hardness penetration and deeper residual stress into the aluminum alloy test pieces...|$|R

50|$|Unlike the European blades, typical American style blades {{are made}} of harder, more brittle steel and are not usually <b>peened,</b> or cannot be <b>peened</b> at all, without cracking. The harder blade holds an edge longer and {{requires}} less frequent honing in the field but after heavy use or damage the edge must be reshaped by grinding, which subtracts metal, rather than reforming the more malleable edge by peening. Some examples have a laminated construction with a hard, brittle, core providing the edge and softer sides providing strength.|$|E
50|$|Plastic {{deformation}} from peening induces {{a residual}} compressive stress in a <b>peened</b> surface, along with tensile {{stress in the}} interior. This stress state resembles the one seen in toughened glass, and is useful for similar reasons.|$|E
50|$|Increases in {{fatigue life}} and {{strength}} are proportionally {{related to the}} depth of the compressive residual stresses imparted by surface enhancement processes such as shot <b>peening</b> but particularly by laser <b>peening.</b> Shot <b>peening</b> imparts compressive residual stresses approximately 0.005 inches deep, laser <b>peening</b> imparts compressive residual stresses from 0.040 to 0.100 inches deep, or deeper. Laser <b>peening</b> provide significant fatigue life extension through shock wave mechanics which plastically deform the surface of the metal component changing the material properties.
