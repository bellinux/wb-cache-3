Although plug-top coil systems would later offer this same advantage, they were not available for another 30 years.

5000|$|The {{other part}} of road {{infrastructure}} Jankomir {{is well known for}} is the Jankomir highway interchange on the Zagreb bypass. The motorways at Jankomir are maintained by Hrvatske autoceste (HAC). The interchange connects A2 and A3 highways with Ljubljanska Avenue. Because of the unusual layout of the modified cloverleaf interchange, as it is formally described, motorists on the A3 have to take an exit to continue straight. This layout is in use due to the A3 formerly serving {{as a part of the}} Highway [...] "Brotherhood and Unity" [...] until the Croatian War of Independence. The interchange is a structure of utmost importance. With over 110,000 cars using the interchange daily, Jankomir interchange is the third-busiest interchange in Zagreb (with Ivanja Reka and Lučko interchange surpassing its traffic levels). A3 west of the interchange uses a faux collector - distributor road scheme (the traffic flows don't converge back to A3 before the Jankomir interchange in the east) until the Rakitje/Ježdovec exit for the Lučko Airport. On this stretch, the highway has 5 lanes going westbound and 4 lanes eastbound. Together with another collector - <b>distributor</b> <b>system</b> inside the interchange adding to this one, the interchange is often complex to navigate, some turns requiring the motorist to take up to 4 exit ramps to reach their destination, although the interchange makes up for this in extensive signage. Due to the collector - <b>distributor</b> <b>systems</b> gaining more total lanes in the interchange, jams on the exit ramps are extremely rare.|$|R
