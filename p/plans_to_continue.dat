5|$|By 1943, Japanese expansionary {{moves in}} the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) had ceased. Their advance in Papua New Guinea had been halted the {{previous}} year by the blocking action that Australian forces had fought along the Kokoda Track. Subsequent defeats at Milne Bay, Buna–Gona, Wau and on Guadalcanal had forced the Japanese on to the back foot. As {{a result of these}} victories, the Allies were able to seize the initiative in the region in mid-1943 and began making <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> to push the Japanese back in New Guinea.|$|E

Dreiberg and Jupiter return to New York with <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> fighting crime. Later, an editor of the New Frontiersman tells a young employee that, as the world is at peace, there is nothing to report on. The editor gives the employee permission to print the contents of a collection of crank mailings, among which is Rorschach's journal.|$|E

For the second rating question: “Do you <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> formally practice mindfulness?” the average score was 8.7 (SD[*]=[*] 1.5), indicating that the majority of those people who rated the program <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> formally <b>continue</b> this practice (e.g. body scan, sitting meditation, mindful stretching/yoga). For the third question: “Do you <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> informally practice mindfulness?” the average rating was 8.9 (SD[*]=[*] 1.5), indicating {{that the majority of the}} participants <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> engage in mindfulness on an informal basis (e.g., SOBER breathing space, mindful eating, walking, daily activities, etc.).|$|R

5|$|When {{development}} {{began in}} December 2007, the studio had employed five full-time team members. Development took eight weeks, though {{creation of the}} Velociraptor and jeep models had already been started before development began. Other staff {{were working on the}} title before then, but two key members were involved in the Independent Games Festival. A teaser trailer was released on January 18, 2008; quickly garnering interest from gaming blogs such as Kotaku and Destructoid. In an interview the developers hinted that a non-free downloadable version with extra content may be produced, or that advertisements may be introduced to the site. The company also revealed <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> developing free games with a development time of four to eight weeks. The most popular of these games will be further developed and released on platforms such as WiiWare, PlayStation Network or Xbox Live Arcade.|$|E
5|$|Bushnell and Dabney {{began to}} design custom {{hardware}} {{to run the}} game's functions, and they soon discovered that the cost to build the whole game's computing systems would be much lower. As a result, they would not need to have multiple instances of the game running on the same machine {{in order to be}} profitable. On the other hand, however, the custom hardware was not as powerful as the more expensive Nova computer, which meant that the pair needed to make gameplay modifications. Spacewar was a two-player game featuring dogfights around the gravitational field of a central star; neither of these features could be run on the dedicated circuits the pair were making, so the game was cut down to a single-player game wherein the player would fight against two computer-controlled spaceships in open space. By January 1971, the pair had built some basic hardware which could connect to a monitor, with <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> expanding it to make a game now named Cosmic Combat, but they were still far away from turning what was then a dot moving on a screen into a full Spacewar-like game cabinet.|$|E
