2500|$|Canon 36 states, [...] "It {{has seemed}} good that images {{should not be}} in churches so that what is venerated and worshiped not be painted on the walls." [...] It {{allegedly}} forbids pictures in churches (compare the Iconoclastic Controversy in the East); according to Philip Schaff this canon [...] "has often been quoted by Protestants as an argument against image worship as idolatrous; while Roman Catholic writers explain it either as a prohibition of representations of the deity only, or as a <b>prudential</b> <b>measure</b> against heathen desecration of holy things". Canon 36 was the first official statement on art by the Christian Church and so of special interest in the history of Early Christian and medieval art, even if it represents Church policy only within the limits of the synod's jurisdiction of Spain. [...] Recent scholarship argues that, rather than read the canon as a simple prohibition against the use of Christian art as idolatrous as has traditionally been done, its purpose was to counter a disturbing culture of apostasy and loss of communal identity that had arisen in the Spanish Church through the strong integration of the Christian subculture within the dominant pagan culture (the result of a peaceful period of social integration followed by an unusually bloody persecution). [...] In this, Canon 36 was a compromise solution in its silence on the subject of private Christian art. [...] Never adopted outside of Spain (although many other canons of the Synod of Elvira were), Canon 36 is tacit evidence of a significant point of transition {{in the development of a}} distinctly Christian artistic culture, one that was leaving the venerable Judaic precedent of the Second Commandment behind as the Church cautiously accepted its increasingly mainstream status and the powerful socio-political dynamic that was a part of this.|$|E
40|$|This article {{proposes to}} insert a bank capital channel (BCC) in the {{theoretical}} framework proposed by Bernanke et al.

This premium is lastly passed on to firms? credit conditions. Simulations confirm that shocks are more amplified than in the BGG model, and confirm the importance of the financial context for macroeconomic volatility.

Sharp increase in house prices in Hong Kong SAR in 2009 - 2010 has led to concerns of an emerging real estate bubble. According to our measure of price deviation from fundamentals, which should be taken as an early warning indicator of market exuberance, the current level of house prices in Hong Kong SAR {{does not seem to be}} significantly higher than would be justified by underlying fundamentals. Moreover, unlike advanced economies before 2007 - 8, deviation from fundamentals has not been persistent in Hong Kong. Going forward, low interest rate and improving growth prospects, as well as a tight supply, particularly in the mass market, means that house price growth will continue to be strong. This is the period in which vulnerability may be accumulating, and tight prudential standards and fiscal measures will be required to tame price inflation.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{includes four}} studies broadly {{connected to the}} causes and consequences of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007 - 8 from a political economy perspective. Following the intro-duction, Chapter 2 analyzes the political roots of massive foreign reserves accumulation, which {{has contributed to the}} American credit boom before the financial crisis. The study shows that elections tend to explain why democracies have acquired less foreign reserves than authoritarian regimes. Basel III was a regulatory consequence of the Global Financial Crisis, which is scheduled to impose liquidity requirements as a <b>prudential</b> <b>measure</b> for commercial banks. Chapter 3 examines whether these liquidity requirements could have an unintended negative effect on monetary stability. Based on a new dataset of reserve and liquidity requirements, the results show that inflation is more robust to changes in the velocity of money if reserve and liquidity requirements are low. Increases in the velocity of money are associated with higher inflation rates if reserve and liquidity requirements are high. The ability of partisan politics to shape economic policies according to ideological goals has been regularly questioned in an era of globalization and austerity. Chapter 4 suggests that government ideology still has a pronounced impact on economic policy-making based on a sample of OECD and new EU member states. Chapter 5 analyzes why major business leaders in France and Germany have publicly supported the euro in the weeks before a bailout program got enacted by the European Council in July 2011. The study shows that direct corporate interest did not appear to matter. Instead, business leaders appeared to be more likely to join the campaign if they were well-connected in business and political networks. The findings suggest that managers disregarded their short-term economic interest to improve their long-term ties with political decision-makers...|$|E

40|$|Mediterranean {{red coral}} (Corallium rubrum, L 1758) is a colonial anthozoan endemic to the Mediterranean Sea. Due {{to the high}} {{economic}} value of its carbonate axial skeleton this species has been harvested and traded since ancient times. In {{the last two decades}} a reduction of the overall fishing yield by 2 / 3 has been recorded. Data on shallow populations suggest that several coastal shallow-water populations have been depleted and colony size reduced due to the over-harvesting these populations faced. These populations need therefore conservation and restoration actions. To this aim management approaches based on a detailed knowledge of specific population demographic features are the key to ensure long-term exploitation sustainability. At the present long-term studies on Mediterranean red coral demography are scarce due to its slow growth and longevity. Aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the demography of two different populations of Corallium rubrum located in Portofino (Ligurian Coast, Italy) and Cap de Creus (Costa Brava, Spain). Both populations dwell within two Marine Protected Areas in which Corallium rubrum management is different. Harvesting is regulated at Cap de Creus while banned at Portofino since 1999. Moreover, illegal harvesting also occurs in the Spanish area, seriously affecting the local Mediterranean red coral population. To determine the age of the colonies of Corallium rubrum in the two areas a sclerochronological approach has been applied. The estimated colony growth rates of the two populations (0. 22 and 0. 24 at Portofino and Cap de Creus respectively) are similar to those observed in other populations and CaCO 3 deposition rate (measured as circular crown area) is constant overtime. These results suggest a similar growth pattern of C. rubrum over different geographic areas. The decrease in diameter growth with age suggests that this colony descriptor may not be the most reliable descriptor of colony growth mostly for larger / older colonies. Others, such as weight or branching pattern, should be taken into account to assess the growth rate of the red coral. Differences in the life-span of the two populations indicate a recovery trend in Portofino from the previous exploitation occurred till the 1970 s. On the contrary the population of Cap de Creus, still object of both legal and illegal harvesting, shows a shorter life span by about 25 % and a population structure dominated by young colonies. Data on 1) colony density; 2) population size/age structure, 3) reproduction; 4) survival have been merged in two “static life – history tables” – one for each population - in order to describe population – specific structure. Lower densities, shorter life - span, lower larval output and higher mortality emerged for the harvested population of Cap de Creus than Portofino, despite the two populations present the same sex ratio and the same average fecundity. The minimum size for commercial harvest of C. rubrum in Cap de Creus is 7 mm. These findings underline that such measure could represent a conservative limit allowing adult colonies to reproduce about 25 times during their life-span. Despite this, it is worth to note that colonies bigger than 7 mm in diameter are very scarce in Cap the Creus (only 4 on 163 colonies collected on whole, and not considered in population age determination because of morphological limitation). It is necessary for a sustainable fishery management, to maximise the yield ensuring an adequate number of sexually mature individuals: 7 mm in diameter could be a <b>prudential</b> <b>measure,</b> whatever respected. The “static life – history tables” here reported will be the base to set out demographic models that will allow to project population trends over time. This approach, applied to populations with different life-histories, will allow to compare their demographic structures and trends and to set out conservation and management strategies suitable for specific local populations...|$|E

For developing countries, in addition to some general considerations on policy design and implementation, a range of issues may warrant special attention. These include the balance between financial stability and financial development objectives, selection and calibration of policy instruments according to national circumstances and taking into account data limitations and capacity constraints as well as other practical challenges, and continued efforts to improve supervisory independence, supervisory powers and analytical capacity and to ensure adequate resources in order to perform the required tasks.

40|$|Brazil has a {{long history}} of {{dependence}} on external savings to foster its economic growth, thus a strong experience in monitoring foreign capital flows. In this context, the register of any transaction that implies an exchange between foreign and domestic currencies should be done in an on line system which allows for the identification of the nature of the capital flow. This register is also needed because transactions in foreign currency in the domestic economy are legally forbidden. These registers provide statistics on different categories of capital inflows and outflows, allowing analysts and policy makers to interpret the current scenario as well as to adopt measures to stimulate and/or restrict the flows. These statistics also allow the evaluation of the effectiveness of the measures implemented. This article presents the system of collection of capital flows statistics and its recent improvements.

Under this context that can be understood the implementation of capital account regulation (CAR) after 2009, which was complemented with another kind of regulation, the so-called FX Derivatives Regulation (FXDR). This paper shows that only when Brazilian government adopted these two kinds of regulations simultaneously, the policy effectiveness increased in terms of protecting the Brazilian currency from upward pressures.

Dollarization of credit and deposit of commercial banks - across all sectors and maturities - has declined, with larger declines for commercial credit and time and saving deposits. The analysis {{presented in this paper}} confirms that de-dollarization has been driven by macroeconomic stability, introduction of prudential policies to better reflect currency risk (such as the management of reserve requirements), and the development of the capital market in soles. Further de-dollarization efforts could focus on these three fronts.

40|$|Sudden capital {{outflows}} {{were at the}} heart of the 1997 - 98 Asian crisis. Ten years later, capital flows are back on the policy agenda, but in a very different context. The countries of East Asia are now getting more inflows than they can effectively absorb and the upward pressure on exchange rates is unwelcome. These capital inflows reflect an ongoing structural disequilibrium: foreign capital will be attracted by the higher returns and the prospect of currency appreciation. In this environment, the exchange rate will be poorly anchored by fundamentals, which threatens the stability of the financial system. There is a range of possible policy responses. 'Sand in the wheels,' hedging, fiscal surpluses, current account surpluses, intervention using foreign exchange reserves, domestic taxes (both on foreign income and on capital gains), taxes on inflows (unremunerated reserve requirements), better bankruptcy arrangements, and stronger <b>prudential</b> <b>measures</b> may make some contribution, but each will be limited by institutional constraints and administrative capabilities...|$|R
