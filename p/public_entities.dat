25|$|The OO {{principle}} {{is that all}} of the functions (and only the functions) that access the internal representation of a type should be encapsulated within the type definition. C++ supports this (via member functions and friend functions), but does not enforce it: the programmer can declare parts or all of the representation of a type to be public, and is allowed to make <b>public</b> <b>entities</b> that {{are not part of the}} representation of the type. Therefore, C++ supports not just OO programming, but other decomposition paradigms, like modular programming.|$|E

25|$|One major hurdle to {{entrance}} into firefighting for women {{was the lack}} of facilities. The immediate problem of sleeping quarters and bathing areas had to be solved before women could participate fully in firefighting as an occupation and as a culture. Communal showers and open bunk halls were designed for men only. Today fire stations, as <b>public</b> <b>entities,</b> must either follow gender equity law or face judicial injunctions, they are now designed to accommodate firefighters of both genders, some female firefighters still face issues related to their gender.|$|E
25|$|Laws against {{adultery}} {{have been}} named as invasive and incompatible with principles of limited government (see Dennis J. Baker, The Right Not to be Criminalized: Demarcating Criminal Law's Authority (Ashgate) chapter 2). Much of the criticism comes from libertarianism, the consensus among whose adherents is that government must not intrude into daily personal lives and that such disputes are to be settled privately rather than prosecuted and penalized by <b>public</b> <b>entities.</b> It is also argued that adultery laws are rooted in religious doctrines; which {{should not be the}} case for laws in a secular state.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, Peru's {{international}} currency reserves were built up from nearly zero at the end of García's term to almost US$10 billion. Fujimori also left a smaller state bureaucracy and reduced government expenses (in contrast to the historical pattern of bureaucratic expansion), a technically minded (but widely perceived as politicized) administration of <b>public</b> <b>entities</b> like SUNAT (the tax collection agency), a large number of new schools (not only in Lima but in Peru's small towns), more roads and highways, and new and upgraded communications infrastructure. These improvement led to the revival of tourism, agroexport, industries and fisheries.|$|E

25|$|In September 2006, SENER {{launched}} the Energy Plus (Energía Plus) {{program with the}} objective of increasing generation capacity and meeting the rising demand for electricity. The program applies for consumption levels above those for 2005. CAMMESA requires all large users (above 300kW) to contract the difference between their current demand and their demand in the year 2005 in the Energy Plus market. In this new de-regulated market, only energy produced from new generation plants will be traded. The aim of the program is twofold. In one hand, it seeks to guarantee supply to residential consumers, <b>public</b> <b>entities,</b> and small and medium enterprises. On the other hand, it aims at encouraging self-generation by the industrial sector and electricity cogeneration.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{technique}} for authorities, either <b>public</b> <b>entities</b> such as law enforcement or private organizations like companies, seizing a computer (usually a laptop) {{that they believe}} is being used improperly is to first physically separate the suspect user from the computer enough {{that he or she}} cannot touch it, to prevent them from closing its lid, unplugging it or typing a command. Once they have done so, they often install a device in the USB port that spoofs minor actions of a mouse, touchpad or keyboard, preventing the computer from going into sleep mode, from which it would usually return to a lock screen which would require a password. One program commonly used for this purpose is Mouse Jiggler.|$|E
25|$|According to the 2009 Human Rights Report {{prepared}} by the US State Department, although the judiciary is independent, weaknesses in the system, particularly in jurisdictions where reforms have not been implemented, make court decisions susceptible to improper influence by both private and <b>public</b> <b>entities,</b> particularly {{at the state and}} local level. Civil society organizations reported that corruption, inefficiency, and a lack of transparency continued to be major problems in the judiciary. NGO representatives reported that the country's conviction rate was only between 1 and 2 percent, citing a general indifference and ineffectiveness of the justice system. A poll conducted by Grupo Reforma and published in a Mexico City daily in August found that 68 percent of respondents had no or little trust in the judiciary.|$|E
