This study discusses filtration stability and hydrophilic property of four types of <b>polyethersulfone</b> hollow <b>fiber</b> membrane prepared with and without polymeric additives. The effect of membrane treatment (soaked in hot water and hypochlorite solution) on the filtration performance and hydrophilic property was investigated.

When tested with human whole blood in vitro, the FcMBL hemoadsorption filter (FcMBL-HF) produced efficient (90 &# 8211; 99 %) removal of Gram negative (Escherichia coli) and positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria, fungi (Candida albicans) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -endotoxin. When tested in rats, extracorporeal therapy with the FcMBL-HF device reduced circulating pathogen and endotoxin levels by more than 99 %, and prevented pathogen engraftment and inflammatory cell recruitment in the spleen, lung, liver and kidney when compared to controls. Studies in rats revealed that treatment with bacteriocidal antibiotics resulted in a major increase in the release of microbial fragments or ‘pathogen-associated molecular patterns’ (PAMPs) in vivo, and that these PAMPs were efficiently removed from blood within 2 h using the FcMBL-HF; in contrast, they remained at high levels in animals treated with antibiotics alone. Importantly, cleansing of PAMPs from the blood of antibiotic-treated animals with the FcMBL-hemoadsorbent device resulted in reduced organ pathogen and endotoxin loads, suppressed inflammatory responses, and resulted in more stable vital signs compared to treatment with antibiotics alone. As PAMPs trigger the cytokine cascades that lead to development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and contribute to septic shock and death, co-administration of FcMBL-hemoadsorption with antibiotics could offer a more effective approach to sepsis therapy. ope...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the effects of dope extrusion rate (DER) on <b>polyethersulfone</b> hollow <b>fiber</b> ultrafiltration membrane performance and morphology. The hollow fiber ultrafiltration membranes were produced by using a simple dry/wet spinning process with forced convection in the dry air gap. A newly developed dope solution consists of 20. 6 wt. % polyethersulfone (PES), 63. 6 wt. % 1 - methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP), 9. 3 wt. % polyethylene glycol (PEG) and a mixture of potassium acetate and water (20 / 80 wt. %) was used as a bore fluid in this study. This newly developed dope solution was designed to be very close to its cloud point (binodal line) in order to speed up the coagulation process so that the relaxation effect on molecular orientation can be reduced. The dope extrusion rate was varied from 2. 0 to 4. 0 cm 3 /min with 0. 5 cm 3 /min increments in order to study the effect of DER on fiber performance and morphology. The experimental results showed that the flux of the hollow fiber ultrafiltration membranes decreases while the separation performance for particular solute increases with an increase in dope extrusion rate. This suggests that the outer skin layer of the membranes becomes apparently thicker and denser with increasing dope extrusion rate. Once the separation performance reaches maximum (critical point), the rejection decreases with increasing dope extrusion rate, observed possibly due to formation of less tighten outer skin structure at high dope extrusion rate. Plane-polarized Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that membrane spun at dope extrusion rate of 3. 5 cm 3 /min showed largest spectrum difference suggesting that higher molecular orientation is responsible for an enhanced separation performance.

The membrane was prepared by coating commercial <b>polyethersulfone</b> (PES) hollow <b>fibers</b> with a layer of sulfonated polyether ether ketone (SPEEK). The SPEEK coated membrane was significantly more oleophobic than the support PES membrane, possibly due to a non-porous surface, higher hydrophilicity, and more negatively charged SPEEK surface. The SPEEK coated membrane could achieve complete oil rejection without any observable membrane fouling and considerably higher salt, turbidity, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) rejection than the support PES membrane. An initial increase in water flux was observed with the SPEEK coated membrane. The flux increase observed here could be attributed to the incorporation of SDS molecules into SPEEK polymeric network and subsequent electrostatic interaction amongst charged functional groups leading to conformational changes of the SPEEK layer. Dynamic adsorption and desorption experiments illustrated the interaction between SDS and SPEEK.

Further, SEM and confocal laser microscopy studies showed the significantly high HEK- 293 cells attachment and proliferation on GTP HFMs which was corroborated by results of glucose consumption analysis and MTT cell proliferation assay. High ultrafiltration coefficient (110 3 mL/m(2) /h/mmHg), and albumin solute rejection (94. 87 +/- 0. 5 %) were also measured for GTP HFMs. Thus, these results clearly indicated that the synergistic effect of additives improved the biocompatibility and ultrafiltration in GTP HFMs. The developed GTP HFMs can potentially be used for simultaneous/sequential cells attachment and proliferation, and ultrafiltration applications such as the bioartificial kidney.

Among the parameters that were studied in this work are air gap distance, dope extrusion rate, bore fluid flow rate, and the take-up speed. The contact angle was measured to determine the hydrophilicity of the fibers. Membrane with sufficient hydrophilicity properties is desired for hemodialysis application to avoid fouling and increase its biocompatibility. The influences of the hollow fiber's morphology (i. e., diameter and wall thickness) on the performance of the membranes were evaluated by pure water flux and BSA rejection. The experimental results showed that the dope extrusion rate to bore fluid flow rate ratio should be maintained at 1 : 1 ratio to produce a perfectly rounded asymmetric hollow fiber membrane. Moreover, the flux of the hollow fiber spun at higher air gap distance had better flux than the one spun at lower air gap distance. Furthermore, spinning asymmetric hollow fiber membranes at high air gap distance helps to produce a thin and porous skin layer, leading to a better flux but a relatively low percentage of rejection for BSA separation. Findings from this study would serve as primary data which will be a useful guide for fabricating a high performance hemodialysis hollow fiber membrane...|$|R
40|$|This study {{highlights}} the design strategy of highly asymmetric hollow fiber membranes that possess both characteristics of high flux and {{high mechanical strength}} to effectively reap the osmotic energy from seawater brine with an ultrahigh power density. An advanced co-extrusion technology was employed to fabricate the <b>polyethersulfone</b> (PES) hollow <b>fiber</b> supports with diversified structures from macrovoid to sponge-like. The microstructure of the supports is found critical for the stability and water permeability of the thin film composite (TFC) membranes. A high porosity in the porous layer is needed to reduce internal concentration polarization, while a thick and relatively dense skin layer underneath the TFC layer is required to maintain good mechanical stability and stress dissipation. The pore size of the supporting layer underneath the TFC layer must be small with a narrow pore size distribution to ensure {{the formation of a}} less-defective, highly permeable and mechanically stable TFC layer. The newly developed hollow fiber comprising high asymmetry, high porosity, and a thick skin layer with a small and narrow pore size distribution underneath the TFC layer produces a maximum power density of 24. 3 W/m 2 at 20. 0 bar by using 1 M NaCl as the concentrated brine and deionized (DI) water as the feed. The proposed design strategy for ultrahigh power density membranes clearly advances the osmotic energy production close to commercialization with a quite cost-effective and practicable approach. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|In this work, <b>polyethersulfone</b> (PES) hollow <b>fiber</b> {{membranes}} incorporated with modified {{silicon dioxide}} (SiO 2) nanoparticles were prepared and characterized for a water treatment process. Prior to doping preparation, commercial SiO 2 nanoparticles were first modified using a {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS) solution to minimize their agglomeration in the dope solution. The surface-modified nanoparticles were analysed by TEM, BET and zeta potential to determine the particle size, surface area and surface charge, respectively. The effect of modified SiO 2 loadings ranging from zero to 4 wt% on the properties of PES-based membranes was examined with respect to thermal stability, hydrophilicity, mechanical strength, pure water flux and protein rejection. The {{results showed that the}} modified nanoparticles have reduced agglomeration and greater negative surface charge in comparison to the unmodified nanoparticles. SEM-EDX and FTIR analyses confirmed the presence of modified SiO 2 in the PES membrane matrix. It is also found that the thermal stability and hydrophilicity of the composite membranes were improved upon the addition of modified SiO 2. The pure water flux and protein rejection of the composite membranes were significantly higher than the control PES membrane. At optimum nanoparticle loading (2 wt%), the composite membrane demonstrated 87. 23 L m(- 2) h(- 1) water flux and 93. 6 % protein rejection in comparison to 44. 2 L m(- 2) h(- 1) and 80. 8 % shown by the control PES membrane. The results suggested that the modified SiO 2 nanoparticles have great potential to improve membrane water flux without compromising its rejection capability...|$|R
40|$|The limited {{removal of}} {{metabolic}} waste products in dialyzed kidney patients leads to high morbidity and mortality. One powerful solution {{for a more}} complete removal of those metabolites might be offered by a bioartificial kidney device (BAK), which contains a hybrid "living membrane" with functional proximal tubule epithelial cells (PTEC). These cells are supported by an artificial functionalized hollow fiber membrane (HFM) {{and are able to}} actively remove the waste products. In our earlier studies, conditionally immortalized human PTEC (ciPTEC) showed to express functional organic cationic transporter 2 (OCT 2) when seeded on small size flat or hollow <b>fiber</b> <b>polyethersulfone</b> (PES) membranes. Here, an upscaled "living membrane" is presented. We developed and assessed the functionality of modules containing three commercially available MicroPES HFM supporting ciPTEC. The HFM were optimally coated with L-Dopa and collagen IV to support a uniform and tight monolayer formation of matured ciPTEC under static culturing conditions. Both abundant expression of zonula occludens- 1 (ZO- 1) protein and limited diffusion of FITC-inulin confirm a clear barrier function of the monolayer. Furthermore, the uptake of 4 -(4 -(dimethylamino) styryl) -N-methylpyridinium iodide (ASP+), a fluorescent OCT 2 substrate, was studied in absence and presence of known OCT inhibitors, such as cimetidine and a cationic uremic solutes mixture. The ASP+ uptake by the living upscaled membrane was decreased by 60 % in the presence of either inhibitor, proving the active function of OCT 2. In conclusion, this study presents a successful upscaling of a living membrane with active organic cation transport as a support for BAK device...|$|R
40|$|A {{limiting}} factor {{of the long-term}} function of bioartificial organs is oxygen delivery to the encapsulated tissue. This study determined whether incorporation of endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF) into the alginate core of a hollow fiber bioartificial organ will induce neovascularization around the hollow <b>fiber.</b> <b>Polyethersulfone</b> (PES) and polyvinylidine difluoride (PVDF) hollow fibers were examined. Endothelial cell growth factor was incorporated into sodium alginate, extruded into the lumen of hollow fibers, and cured in calcium chloride. Samples without ECGF were fabricated and used as controls. Hollow fibers were implanted into 16 rats. For each rat, two implants were placed subcutaneously and two intraperitoneally, one with and one without ECGF at each site. Implants were placed {{on opposite sides of}} each animal. Implants were removed 65 days later and examined using immunohistochemical methods and light microscopy {{to determine the extent of}} neovascularization. A total of 64 implants were used. Most intraperitoneal implants were found free floating but were encased within a 100 -microm thick avascular fibrotic reaction. This finding was independent from the presence of ECGF. Hollow fibers without ECGF, implanted subcutaneously, also had an avascular fibrotic reaction surrounding each implant. Subcutaneous implants with incorporation of ECGF within the alginate core had marked neovascularization within the fibrotic overgrowth that surrounded these implants. This was most prevalent in hollow fibers, with the thin separation layer facing the fiber lumen irrespective of limiting pore size. Potent angiogenic factors, such as ECGF, incorporated into diffusion chamber bioartificial organs can promote neovascularization around the subcutaneously implanted hollow fiber and may improve oxygen delivery to the tissue encapsulated within devices based on this technology...|$|R
40|$|The {{preparation}} of <b>polyethersulfone</b> (PES) hollow <b>fiber</b> membranes {{has been studied}} using N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) as solvent, polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) as weak nonsolvent and water as strong nonsolvent. When PEG 400 is used as polymeric additive to the spinning dope the viscosity of the PES solution is strongly enhanced. Furthermore, {{it was observed that}} PEG 400 could be added to the solution in large amounts without causing phase separation (NMP/PEG ratio 1 : 9, PES concentration approximately 11 wt. %). Membranes prepared from a solution containing a NMP/PEG ratio of 1 : 1 results in higher fluxes than when a ratio of 1 : 4 is used. Similar fluxes were obtained for PES concentrations of 16 and 20 wt. %. Looking at the fiber cross-section it became clear that macrovoid formation could not be suppressed by the addition of PEG 400 alone, not even at concentrations as high as 38 wt. %. Only when relatively large amounts of water were added to the dope solution macrovoids disappeared and nice spongy structures were obtained. Variation of the bore liquid composition using the components NMP, PEG 400 and water showed to be a powerful method to control the pore size of the bore surface. Pores of 5 – 28 nm were obtained in combination with high pure water fluxes; e. g. a membrane with pores of 7 nm had a pure water flux of 940 l/(m 2 h bar) and showed 100 % BSA retention. When an air gap larger than 10 mm was applied the shell surface contained relatively large pores. Spinning directly in water (airgap= 0) resulted in shell side pores of 8 – 10 nm, while an air gap of 10 mm resulted in pore sizes of 40 – 54 nm...|$|R
