40|$|Abstract—In {{the context}} of data {{warehousing}} and business intelligence, data quality is of utmost importance. However, many mid-size data warehouse (DWH) <b>projects</b> do <b>not</b> <b>implement</b> a proper data quality process due to huge up-front investments. However, assessing and monitoring data quality is necessary to establish confidence in the DWH data. In this paper, we describe a data quality monitoring system developed collaboratively at HS Hannover and SHS Viveon: The “Data Checking Engine” (DCE). The goal {{of the system is}} to provide DWH projects with an easy and quickly deployable solution to assess data quality while still providing highest flexibility in the definition of the assessment rules. It allows to express complex quality rules and implements a template mechanism to facilitate the deployment of large numbers of similar rules...|$|R

In 1945, Spratling was asked by two friends, Alaska's Territorial Governor, Ernest Gruening, and the Director of the Indian Arts and Crafts Board, Rene d'Harnoncourt, to replicate his success in Alaska. Spratling recommended the establishment of workshop and exhibit centers in various regions of Alaska organized into a Federation of Alaska Native Arts. Each center's unique production would be born out of the traditions in iconography, materials, and techniques belonging to that specific region. [...] In 1948, Alaskan World War II veterans were sent to Taxco for instruction in silversmithing. Spratling also produced 200 prototypes as future inspiration for the newly trained Alaskans in their workshop centers.

Because of this, it will require replacing expensive hardware and software for further development and monitoring of smart city infrastructure and applications [11].|$|R

The agreed protocol, OpenFlow, suggests securing the southbound communication with Transport Layer Security (TLS).

From the telecommunication providers’ perspective, one of the major SDN consumers besides data centers, the data plane becomes much more complicated with the addition of wireless data plane as it involves numerous wireless technologies. Therefore, the complicated resource management along with the security of such a data plane can hinder the migration to SDN. In this paper, we propose securing the distributed SDN communication with a multidomain capable Identity-Based Cryptography (IBC) protocol, particularly for the southbound and wireless data plane communication.
