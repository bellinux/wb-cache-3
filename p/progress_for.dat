5|$|The {{legacy of}} PedroII of Brazil began to become {{apparent}} {{soon after his}} death. Emperor PedroII was the second and last monarch of the Empire of Brazil, whose long 58-year reign (1831–1889) represented a time of remarkable prosperity and <b>progress</b> <b>for</b> his country.

5|$|Due to the fog, {{visibility}} {{was low and}} the {{two main}} forces failed to notice Oxford's victory over Hastings. As such, {{the collapse of the}} Yorkist left wing had little (if any) effect on morale of either side. The fighting between Montagu's and Edward's groups was evenly matched and intense. The Lancastrian left wing, however, was suffering treatment similar to that Oxford had inflicted on its counterpart; Gloucester exploited the misaligned forces and beat Exeter back. <b>Progress</b> <b>for</b> Edward's brother was slow because his group was fighting up a slight slope. Nonetheless, the pressure he exerted on the Lancastrian left wing rotated the entire battle line. Warwick, seeing the shift, ordered most of his reserves to help ease the pressure on Exeter, and took the rest into fighting at the centre. Gradually, the battle line settled to an orientation that slanted north-east to south-west.|$|E
5|$|Following {{an effort}} from the International Maple Syrup Institute (IMSI) and many maple syrup {{producer}} associations, both Canada and the United States have altered their laws regarding {{the classification of}} maple syrup to be uniform.

5|$|Harald's reign {{was marked}} by his {{background}} as a military commander, as he often solved disputes with harsh force. One of his skalds even boasted about how Harald broke settlements he had made, in his battles in the Mediterranean. While the sagas largely focus on Harald's war with Sweyn and the invasion of England, little is said about his domestic policies. Modern historians have taken this as a sign that, despite his absolutism, his reign was one of peace and <b>progress</b> <b>for</b> Norway. Harald is considered to have instituted good economic policies, as he developed a Norwegian currency and a viable coin economy, which in turn allowed Norway to participate in international trade. He initiated trade with Kievan Rus' and the Byzantine Empire through his connections, {{as well as with}} Scotland and Ireland. According to the later sagas, Harald founded Oslo, where he spent much time.|$|E

Controllers also planned for a failure of Mirs power system, which would have resulted in the deorbit being delayed one day, with all guidance and control functions being handled by the Progress spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 Christopher Tolkien {{published}} {{a collection of}} more fragmentary material, under the title Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth. In subsequent years (1983–1996) he {{published a}} large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called The History of Middle-earth. They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in <b>progress</b> <b>for</b> Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing The Hobbit for a third edition, that he would have preferred to completely rewrite the book because of the style of its prose.|$|E

5|$|In {{its third}} year in London, the 2015 show had 15,000 visitors. The fourth London show in October 2016 was {{three times the size}} of the {{original}} exhibition, and had expanded from a wing of the Somerset House to the rest of the building and its courtyard, where Zak Ové installed a site-specific work that was purchased for a sculpture park in Berkshire. The 2016 fair featured 130 artists, including the fair's first artists representing Egypt, Ethiopia, and Ghana. Koyo Kouoh's forum series returned to the event as well. Of the 40 exhibitors from 18 countries, 40 percent were from Africa and 17 galleries debuted at the show.

5|$|Polyaenus's {{accounts}} {{have led}} some modern historians to tentatively propose the following {{synthesis of the}} battle. After the general engagement had been in <b>progress</b> <b>for</b> some time, Philip had his army perform a wheeling manoeuver, with the right wing withdrawing, and the whole line pivoting around its centre. At the same time, wheeling forward, the Macedonian left wing attacked the Thebans on the Greek right and punched {{a hole in the}} Greek line. On the Greek left, the Athenians followed Philip, their line becoming stretched and disordered; the Macedonians then turned, attacked and routed the tired and inexperienced Athenians. The Greek right wing, under the assault of the Macedonian troops under Alexander's command, then also routed, ending the battle.|$|E

Despite heavy opposition, the two transports were bombed, and men and equipment on the beach were strafed. Five Vildebeests were lost in the attack, including the commanding officer of No. 100 Squadron, while one Ki-27 was shot down.|$|E

5|$|The protagonist, Samus Aran, {{must travel}} through the world of Tallon IV searching for twelve Chozo Artifacts that will open {{the path to the}} Phazon meteor impact crater, while {{collecting}} power-ups that enable the player to reach previously inaccessible areas. The Varia Suit, for example, protects Samus' armor against dangerously high temperatures, allowing her to enter volcanic regions. Some of the items are obtained after boss and mini-boss fights, which are encountered in all regions except Magmoor Caverns. Items must be collected in a specific order so that the player may <b>progress.</b> <b>For</b> example, players cannot access certain areas until they find a certain Beam to open doors, or discover new ordnance with which to beat bosses. Like the rest of the series, players are incentivized to explore the open world to find upgrades such as ammunition packs and extra health.|$|E
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome are numbness, tingling, and pain, {{alone or in}} combination. This is followed by weakness of the legs and arms that affects both sides equally and worsens over time. The weakness can take half a day to over two weeks to reach maximum severity, and then becomes steady. In one in five people, the weakness continues to <b>progress</b> <b>for</b> as long as four weeks. The muscles of the neck may also be affected, and about half experience involvement of the cranial nerves which supply the head and face; this may lead to weakness of {{the muscles of the}} face, swallowing difficulties and sometimes weakness of the eye muscles. In 8%, the weakness affects only the legs (paraplegia or paraparesis). Involvement of the muscles that control the bladder and anus is unusual. In total, about a third of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome continue to be able to walk. Once the weakness has stopped progressing, it persists at a stable level ("plateau phase") before improvement occurs. The plateau phase can take between two days and six months, but the most common duration is a week. Pain-related symptoms affect more than half, and include back pain, painful tingling, muscle pain and pain {{in the head and neck}} relating to irritation of the lining of the brain.|$|E
5|$|The normal <b>progress</b> <b>for</b> an able Magister {{was to go}} on {{to further}} study in one of the four faculties at Leuven: Theology, Medicine, Canon Law and Roman Law. Gisbert might have hoped that Mercator would go further in {{theology}} and train for the priesthood but Mercator did not: like many twenty year old young men he was having his first serious doubts. The problem was the contradiction between the authority of Aristotle and his own biblical study and scientific observations, particularly in relation to the creation and description of the world. Such doubt was heresy at the University and {{it is quite possible that}} he had already said enough in classroom disputations to come to the notice of the authorities: fortunately he did not put his sentiments into print. He left Leuven for Antwerp, there to devote his time to contemplation of philosophy. This period of his life is clouded in uncertainty. He certainly read widely but only succeeded in uncovering more contradictions between the world of the Bible and the world of geography, a hiatus which would occupy him for the rest of his life. He certainly could not effect a reconciliation between his studies and the world of Aristotle.|$|E
