25|$|As World War I approached, the {{question}} was hotly discussed in Italy as to which side to be on. Officially, Italy was still in an alliance with Germany and Austria–Hungary. However, in the Tirol, {{an integral part of}} Austria which was mostly German-speaking, the southern part, the <b>province</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trento,</b> was exclusively Italian-speaking. The clergy of Bologna was not totally free from nationalistic fervor either. Therefore, in his capacity as Archbishop, on the outbreak of World War I, della Chiesa made a speech on the Church's position and duties, emphasizing the need for neutrality, promoting peace and the easing of suffering.|$|E
500|$|In the Piedmontese {{valleys and}} some Ligurian {{communities}} of northwestern Italy, the music preserves the strong influence of ancient Occitania. The lyrics of the Occitanic troubadours {{are some of}} the oldest preserved samples of vernacular song, and modern bands like Gai Saber and Lou Dalfin preserve and contemporize Occitan music. The Occitanian culture retains characteristics of the ancient Celtic influence, through the use of six- or seven-hole flutes (fifre) or the bagpipes (piva). The music of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, in northeastern Italy, shares much more in common with Austria and Slovenia including variants of the waltz and the polka. Much of northern Italy shares with areas of Europe further to the north an interest in ballad singing (called canto epico lirico in Italian) and choral singing.

The ancestry of the breed is not clear: {{it has been suggested that}} it derives from the Lamon breed, but this is disputed. It is one of the forty-two autochthonous local sheep breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia, the Italian national association of sheep-breeders.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed at {{exploring}} if and on what extent on-farm mortality, which is regularly notified in national cattle databases in the EU, {{could be used to}} design an early warning system for emerging diseases in cattle. The statistical analysis of mortality rates recorded in Italy in 2008 showed a clear influence by transport, age, sex and season. Through spatial and spatio-clustering methods several geographic area with exceptionally high mortality rates were detected. A more in-dept analysis of individual causes of mortality in the <b>Provinces</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trento</b> and Bolzano showed that on-farm mortality was greatly influenced by management practices and economic conditions. In order to control some of the influencing management factors a model was created to compare for a given population the actual and expected mortality rates. A conclusion of the study was that on-farm mortality regularly notified in national livestock databases could represent an important indicator for evaluating herd management practices. Further analysis and refinement of the applied models would be needed in order to establish a robust method for the detection of anomalous events with respect to the outbreak of animal diseasesJRC.
