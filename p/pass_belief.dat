"The fact is," [...] {{continued}} Bob, [...] "that {{since our}} cook married, and Alice went to California, {{there seems to}} be no possibility of putting our domestic cabinet upon any permanent basis. The number of female persons that have been through our house, and the ravages they have wrought on it for the last six months, <b>pass</b> <b>belief.</b> I had yesterday a bill of sixty dollars' plumbing to pay for damages of various kinds which had had to be repaired in our very convenient water-works; and the blame of each particular one had been bandied like a shuttlecock among our three household divinities. Biddy privately assured my wife that Kate was in the habit of emptying dustpans of rubbish into the main drain from the chambers, and washing any little extra bits down through the bowls; and, in fact, when one of the bathing-room bowls had overflowed so as to damage the frescoes below, my wife, with great delicacy and precaution, interrogated Kate as to whether she had followed her instructions in the care of the water-pipes. Of course she protested the most immaculate care and circumspection. 'Sure, and she knew how careful one ought to be, and wasn't of the likes of thim as wouldn't mind what throuble they made,--like Biddy, who would throw trash and hair in the pipes, and niver listen to her tellin'; sure, and hadn't she broken the pipes in the kitchen, and lost the stoppers, as it was a shame to see in a Christian house?' Ann, the third girl, being privately questioned, blamed Biddy on Monday, and Kate on Tuesday; on Wednesday, however, she exonerated both; but on Thursday, being in a high quarrel with both, she departed, accusing them severally, not only of all the evil practices aforesaid, but of lying and stealing, and all other miscellaneous wickednesses that came to hand. Whereat the two thus accused rushed in, bewailing themselves and cursing Ann in alternate strophes, averring that she had given the baby laudanum, and, taking it out riding, had stopped for hours with it in a filthy lane where the scarlet fever was said to be rife,--in short, made so fearful a picture that Marianne gave up the child's life at once, and has taken to her bed. I have endeavored all I could to quiet her, by telling her that the scarlet fever story was probably an extemporaneous work of fiction, got up to gratify the Hibernian anger at Ann; and that it wasn't in the least worth while to believe one thing more than another from the fact that any of the tribe said it. But she refuses to be comforted, and is so Utopian as to lie there crying, 'Oh, if I only could get one that I could trust,--one that would really speak the truth to me,--one that I might know really went where she said she went, and really did as she said she did!' To have to live so, she says, and bring up little children with those she can't trust out of her sight, whose word is good for nothing,--to feel that her beautiful house and her lovely things are all going to rack and ruin, and she can't take care of them, and can't see where or when or how the mischief is done,--in short, the poor child talks as women do who are violently attacked with housekeeping fever tending to congestion of the brain. She actually yesterday told me that she wished, on the whole, she never had got married, which I take to be the most positive indication of mental alienation." ...|$|E
40|$|Almost {{midway between}} the two {{greatest}} oceans of the world, its eastern boundary marked by the rapid flowing Missouri, the westernmost counties shadowed by the towering ranges of the Rockies, with {{the land of the}} Dakotas to the north and the great agricultural state of Kansas to the south, lies the garden spot of that vast and shadowy country (which but a few short years since was only known as The Great American Desert). Today it is the State of Nebraska, the happy home of one million and a half of thrifty, industrious and prosperous people. In {{less than a third of}} a century—only a moment in the life of a nation—the rolling prairies, the well watered valleys and the undulating slopes of Nebraska hare been reclaimed from the dominion of the Indian and the stampedes of the buffalo. The early explorers who traversed the continent seem to have been blind to the possibility of a civilization between the Missouri River and the Golden Shores beyond the Rockies. Later on the gold seekers crossed the plains with their bull-trains and heeded not the unbroken land that asked only to be tickled with hoe to smile a harvest. Later again a few pioneers ventured to this unknown country and, notwithstanding privations that now seem impossible to endure, they sent such glowing accounts of Nebraska, as an agricultural paradise, that the greatest wave of immigration known in the history of America set in from east to west, and the Great American Desert became only a name and a tradition. The virgin soil of Nebraska proved from the beginning especially suitable for corn, and the early settler had a crop harvested in such a short time that the bounty of nature seemed to him to <b>pass</b> <b>belief</b> when he saw the marvelous result of his first labor. What one man did, so did another. Corn was crowned king of Nebraska, and in 1891 there were no less than four million six hundred thousand acres devoted to his service in the State. The corn crop of Nebraska may well be deemed a guarantee given by nature to the pioneers, insuring them a living while they were settling the State, for those who were to follow them, and making ready the land to produce a wealth and variety of crops the bare enumeration of which almost taxes belief. Before dealing with the unequalled resources of Nebraska in detail, it may be well to say that the life of the State has developed with marvelous rapidity. It has been no mushroom growth, but a rational, logical advance in all things that go to make up a free and liberal commonwealth. Railroads gridiron eighty-one of its ninety counties. Cities have been born and have grown with healthy vigor. Education is amply provided for in schools whi 9 ch dot every township. Churches of all denominations rear their spires and cupolas to the clear sky. The city and county governments are enlightened and progressive. Even the advantage of climtate is added, and no clearer air can be breathed, no such regularly diversified seasons, each with its own importance to the State, can be enjoyed as in this, the most generously blessed of all the States—Nebraska. It is the purpose of this pamphlet to show very briefly, and without the wearying addition of statistics some of the advantages and resources of Nebraska. The State extends a hearty welcome to all who make it their home, relying upon the co-operation of every immigrant to make Nebraska the model State of the West...|$|E

Here, in Part II, we discuss the specializations of BiG-AMP to the problems of matrix completion, robust PCA, and dictionary learning, and present the results of an extensive em-pirical study comparing BiG-AMP to state-of-the-art algorithms on each problem.

40|$|Abstract—Algorithms for {{discrete}} energy minimization are {{of fundamental}} importance in computer vision. In this paper, {{we focus on}} the recent technique proposed by Wainwright et al. [33]—tree-reweighted max-product message passing (TRW). It was inspired by the problem of maximizing a lower bound on the energy. However, the algorithm is not guaranteed to increase this bound—it may actually go down. In addition, TRW does not always converge. We develop a modification of this algorithm which we call sequential tree-reweighted message passing. Its main property is that the bound is guaranteed not to decrease. We also give a weak tree agreement condition which characterizes local maxima of the bound with respect to TRW algorithms. We prove that our algorithm has a limit point that achieves weak tree agreement. Finally, we show that, our algorithm requires half as much memory as traditional message passing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that on certain synthetic and real problems, our algorithm outperforms both the ordinary belief propagation and tree-reweighted algorithm in [33]. In addition, on stereo problems with Potts interactions, we obtain a lower energy than graph cuts.
