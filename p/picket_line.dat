5|$|In April 1989, {{after the}} miners had worked 14 months without benefits, UMWA {{president}} Richard Trumka declared a strike against the Pittston Coal Company. Around 2,000 UMWA members {{who worked for}} Pittston {{walked out of the}} mines and reported to the <b>picket</b> <b>line.</b> Pittston responded to the strike by hiring replacement workers. To ensure that production would continue, Pittston also had help from the state police to escort the replacement miners and coal trucks across the <b>picket</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1983, Greyhound {{operated}} {{a fleet of}} 3,800 buses and carried about 60 percent of the United States' bus-travel market. Starting November 2, 1983, Greyhound suffered a major and bitter drivers' strike with one fatality in Zanesville, Ohio, when a company bus ran over a worker at a <b>picket</b> <b>line.</b> A new contract was ratified December 19, and drivers returned to work the next day.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the union dispute, many club patrons no longer visited the night spot. Those who were {{performers}} were informed of the possibility of fines and suspensions by their respective unions for crossing the Stork Club <b>picket</b> <b>line</b> as the issue continued. Many of Billingsley's friendships, including those of Walter Winchell and J. Edgar Hoover, were over as {{a result of}} the union problems. He began firing staff without good cause. As the dispute dragged on, there was also no longer a live band in the dining room for music; members of the Musicians' Union had crossed the <b>picket</b> <b>line</b> to perform for some time. Previously, the club had no need for advertising; it was mentioned frequently in print and word of mouth without it. In 1963, the club offered a hamburger and French fries for $1.99 in a New York Times advertisement; when those in the know about the club saw it, they realized the Stork Club's days were coming to an end. In the last few months of its operation, at times there were only three customers for the entire evening. On a good day in the mid-1940s, some 2,500 people visited the club.|$|E
5|$|At first, St. Leger {{tried to}} intimidate the fort's {{occupants}} by parading his troops—including the Indians in their war dress—in {{front of the}} fort. When this failed he sent a truce flag bearing a proclamation authored by General Burgoyne; Gansevoort refused to respond. St. Leger then began siege operations, encamping the regulars and artillery on a low rise north of the fort, {{and most of the}} Indians and Loyalists to its south, with a <b>picket</b> <b>line</b> of Indian encampments along the Mohawk River.|$|E
50|$|The {{wildcat strike}} {{which took place}} on the May 29, 2006, was not {{initiated}} by joint action of all the unionized workers in the TTC. <b>Picket</b> <b>lines</b> were assembled by {{a relatively small number of}} mechanical and janitorial workers (approximately 800) across many of the TTC’s yards and garages; locations that housed buses, streetcars, and subway trains. Many operators who showed up for their morning shift joined their co-workers in a sign of , and the remainder were asked by the TTC not to cross the <b>picket</b> <b>lines.</b> Without the operators passing through the <b>picket</b> <b>lines,</b> transit service was halted.|$|R
2500|$|After the 1980 steel strike, many hauliers blacklisted {{drivers who}} refused to cross <b>picket</b> <b>lines</b> to prevent them obtaining work, and so more drivers crossed <b>picket</b> <b>lines</b> in 1984–85 than in {{previous}} disputes. [...] Picketing failed to have the widespread impact of earlier stoppages that led to blackouts and power cuts in the 1970s and electricity companies maintained supplies throughout the winter, the time of biggest demand.|$|R

5|$|Rick Neuheisel {{came off}} the bench to lead the Chargers to three second-half scores. Partly based on this performance, the Buccaneers later signed Neuheisel as a backup quarterback. Although many veteran NFL players crossed the <b>picket</b> <b>line</b> during the week, the Buccaneers were one of only six teams to have no players cross. More than 1,000 area union members joined the Buccaneers regulars in {{picketing}} the game, with some fans tearing up their tickets and joining them.|$|E
5|$|With the news, the English ships {{waited and}} raided the villages on Corvo for supplies. For {{the month of}} July the English ships formed a <b>picket</b> <b>line</b> spaced about six miles apart along a north/south axis. From the {{southern}} flank near Flores Island, the order of ships was Dainty, Golden Dragon, Roebuck, Tiger, Sampson, Prudence and Foresight. The Spanish fleet, which had been sighted briefly, seemed no longer a threat; Alvaro de Bazan had made a major miscalculation: he disobeyed orders and headed further west, allowing the English to first reach the area of interception.|$|E
5|$|After {{directing}} {{and writing}} for the stage in New York, Rossen moved to Hollywood in 1937. There {{he worked as a}} screenwriter for Warner Bros. until 1941, and then interrupted his career to serve until 1944 as the chairman of the Hollywood Writers Mobilization, a body to organize writers for the effort in World War II. In 1945 he joined a <b>picket</b> <b>line</b> against Warner Bros. After making one film for Hal Wallis's newly formed production company, Rossen made one for Columbia Pictures, another for Wallis and most of his later films for his own companies, usually in collaboration with Columbia.|$|E

5|$|Considered the fourth-best {{prospect}} {{in baseball}} by Baseball America {{heading into the}} 1995 season, the Yankees projected Jeter as their starting shortstop. He suffered mild inflammation in his right shoulder in the Arizona Fall League after {{the conclusion of the}} 1994 regular season. As a precaution, the Yankees signed Tony Fernández to a two-year contract. With Fernández the starting shortstop, the Yankees assigned Jeter to Class AAA. During the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, Gene Michael, the Yankees' general manager, offered Jeter the opportunity to work out for the MLB team with replacement players in spring training before the 1995 season. Jeter denied receiving the offer, and did not cross the <b>picket</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Rossen {{joined a}} <b>picket</b> <b>line</b> against Warner Bros, making {{an enemy of}} Jack Warner. Rossen signed a {{contract}} with an independent production company formed by Hal Wallis, who had previously been Warner Bros.' head of production. However Rossen wrote only two full scripts for this company, The Strange Love of Martha Ivers in 1946 and Desert Fury in 1947. In The Strange Love of Martha Ivers Rossen used a short story by John Patrick to introduce the main plot, which was set fifteen years later and which Rossen wrote himself. The relationship between Rossen and Wallis broke down when Rossen received offers from other production companies.|$|E
5|$|Patton was {{regarded}} as more moderate than most coal operators in his relationship to labor unions. Most of his mine workers were not unionized, {{and those who were}} generally belonged to the Southern Labor Union rather than the more confrontational United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). Members of the UMWA local at Shelby Gap maintained that Patton was arrested for clipping a striking miner on a <b>picket</b> <b>line</b> with his pickup truck in the late 1970s. Local law enforcement officials claim no recollection of the incident, and there is no record of an arrest warrant against Patton or an actual arrest.|$|E

5|$|The local nurses' {{union for}} the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital is on strike. Jeff, {{the husband of}} Deb (Chad Morgan), one of the nurses, collapses while walking the <b>picket</b> <b>line.</b> At the {{emergency}} room, House suspects Jeff's extreme niceness and inability to get angry is a major symptom of an underlying condition. After various tests, the team suspects his niceness is a personality change resulting from syphilis. Kutner (Kal Penn) asks the couple if either of them had an affair, {{which could lead to}} syphilis. Deb denies it, stating that it is just the way her husband behaves and that it is impossible for her to not love him.|$|E
5|$|Implementation of Care Not Cash {{began on}} July 1, 2004. As {{part of his}} Care Not Cash initiative, 5,000 more {{homeless}} people were given permanent shelter in the city. As of October 21, 2007, about 2,000 people have been placed into permanent housing with support. Other programs initiated by Newsom to end chronic homelessness include the San Francisco Homeless Outreach Team (SF HOT), and Project Homeless Connect (PHC). On October 27, 2004, during a strike by hotel workers on a dozen San Francisco hotels, Newsom joined UNITE HERE union members on a <b>picket</b> <b>line</b> {{in front of the}} Westin St. Francis Hotel. He vowed that the city would boycott the hotels by not sponsoring city events in any until the hotels agreed to a contract with workers. The contract dispute was settled in September 2006.|$|E
5|$|Much of Livingstone's {{first two}} years were devoted to setting up the Mayoral system and administration. He also devoted much time to battling New Labour's plans to upgrade the London Underground system through a public–private {{partnership}} (PPP) program, believing it to be too expensive and tantamount to the privatisation of a state-owned service. He furthermore had strong concerns about safety; PPP would divide {{different parts of the}} Underground among various companies, something that he argued threatened a holistic safety and maintenance program. These concerns were shared by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) trade union, who went on strike over the issue, being joined on the <b>picket</b> <b>line</b> by Livingstone. Appointing Bob Kiley as transport commissioner, the duo argued that the upgrade should be carried out in state hands through a public bond issue, as had been done {{in the case of the}} New York City Subway. They launched court cases against the government over PPP in 2001–02, but were ultimately unsuccessful, and the project went ahead, with the Underground being privatised in January 2003.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, the Jets {{won their}} first two games. NFL players then staged a strike; a team {{composed}} mostly of replacement players lost two of the next three games. The locker room was divided after the strike due to the decision of a few players, led by Gastineau, to cross the <b>picket</b> <b>line.</b> The Jets remained in contention in a mediocre AFC East {{through much of the}} season, but dropped all four games in December to finish 6–9, in last place. In 1988, the Sack Exchange era ended as Joe Klecko failed his offseason physical and was waived, linebacker Lance Mehl announced his retirement during training camp, and Mark Gastineau retired midseason, citing personal reasons. In spite of these departures, the Jets finished with an 8–7–1 record. They secured a winning record by ending the season with a victory over the Giants, which cost their in-state rivals a playoff berth. The team performed badly in 1989, finishing 4–12. On December 18, 1989, the Jets hired executive Dick Steinberg from the New England Patriots to take over as general manager. Three days after New York's final game of the season, a 37–0 loss to the Bills at Giants Stadium, Steinberg fired Walton and began to search for the team's 10th coach. The disastrous 1989 campaign cost Walton the chance to be the first Jets coach to complete his career with a winning record, a statistic he later admitted he cared about deeply.|$|E
5|$|In response, unions {{across the}} United States {{prepared}} {{a general strike}} {{in support of the}} event. On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the <b>picket</b> <b>line,</b> and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd. The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square. A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer. In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other. Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed. Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer. The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the Haymarket affair, and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight-hour day was made. The event also had the secondary purpose of memorialising workers killed {{as a result of the}} Haymarket affair. Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of International Workers' Day on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.|$|E
25|$|In March 2010 the Welsh Labour Party twice {{refused to}} cross the PCS union <b>picket</b> <b>line,</b> Carwyn Jones citing that it was {{ingrained}} in Labour's thinking not to cross a <b>picket</b> <b>line.</b> This led to strong criticism of the government for not crossing the <b>picket</b> <b>line</b> from the Welsh Conservative Party and the Welsh Liberal Democrats.|$|E
