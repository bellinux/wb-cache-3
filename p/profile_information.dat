5|$|Desperately {{trying to}} figure out a {{connection}} between the murdered families, Graham realizes that someone must have seen their home movies. He and Crawford deduce where the films were processed. They identify the lab in St. Louis and fly there immediately. Dollarhyde has been casing the victims' homes through home movies, enabling him to prepare for the break-ins in extreme detail. Graham determines which employees that match their <b>profile</b> <b>information</b> have seen these films and obtains Dollarhyde's home address, to which he and Crawford travel with a police escort. At Dollarhyde's home, Reba is terrified as he contemplates what to do with her. As he struggles to kill Reba with a piece of broken mirror glass, police teams assemble around the house. Seeing that Dollarhyde has someone inside with him, Graham lunges through a window. He is quickly subdued by Dollarhyde, who retrieves a shotgun and uses it to wound Crawford and kill two police officers. Wounded in the firefight, Dollarhyde returns to the kitchen to shoot Graham, but misses because of his injuries and is killed himself when Graham returns fire. Graham, Reba, and Crawford are tended to by paramedics before Graham returns home and retires permanently.|$|E

It allows computing clients to verify the identity of an end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server, as well as to obtain the basic <b>profile</b> <b>information</b> about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner. In technical terms, OpenID Connect specifies a RESTful HTTP API, using JSON as a data format. OpenID Connect allows a range of organizations, including web-based, mobile and JavaScript clients, to request and receive information about authenticated sessions and end-users. The OpenID Connect specification is extensible, supporting optional features such as encryption of identity data, discovery of OpenID providers, and session management.|$|E

Additional indexes, such as the unidentified human remain index, the missing persons index, and the biological relatives of missing persons index, are used to assist in identifying missing persons. Specialty indexes also exist for other specimens that don't fall into the other categories. These indexes include the staff index, for profiles of employees who work with the samples, and the multi-allelic offender index, for single-source samples that have three or more alleles at two or more loci.|$|E

500|$|As {{early as}} 1957, it was {{recognized}} that an increasing {{trend in the}} number of tropical cyclones each season in the Atlantic Basin was at least partially tied to increasing observations and better records. [...] By analyzing the density of ship tracks over time, {{it has been estimated that}} between 1900 and 1966, an average of two storms per year are missing from HURDAT. [...] This is mainly due to a lack of satellite imagery and lack of reconnaissance aircraft prior to 1943. [...] An additional storm per year is likely missing prior to the advent of new technologies. [...] These technologies include satellite-derived Quikscat winds, satellite-derived temperature <b>profile</b> <b>information,</b> and Robert Hart's cyclone phase space diagrams, which have led to a recent increase in tropical cyclone detection. [...] Quikscat was launched in 1999, and has been credited with allowing Chantal to be named during the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season.

In addition to basic and performance-based information about researchers necessary to generate <b>profiling</b> <b>information,</b> we introduce researcher performance index models for researcher analysis service. The models can that measure qualitative and quantitative performance, researcher influence, and growth potential, which are necessary to analyze the skills of a researcher from multiple perspectives. We measure the qualitative performance index of researchers by using the citation index of the papers they have published. The quantitative performance index can be measured based on a researcher’s published papers. The Influence index measures the social influence of researchers according to their academic work. The growth potential index measures {{the speed at which}} a researcher improves research performance. We expect to develop a researcher analysis service that can evaluate a researcher’s performance and enhance his or her research abilities...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{top-down}} methodology aimed at evaluating the scalability of Spiking Neural Network (SNN) simulations on massively many-core and densely interconnected platforms. Spiking neural networks mimic brain activity by emulating spikes sent among neurons populations. Many-core platforms are emerging computing targets to achieve real-time simulation SNN. Neurons are mapped to parallel cores and spikes are sent over the on-chip and off-chip network. However, due to the heterogeneity and complexity of neuron population activity, achieving an efficient exploitation of platforms resources is a challenging problem, often impacting simulation reliability and limiting the biological network size. To address this challenge, the proposed methodology, based on customized SNN configurations, extracts detailed <b>profiling</b> <b>information</b> about network usage of on-chip and off-chip resources. We first show {{the results of the}} application of our methodology to the SpiNNaker neuromorphic many-core platform. Then, we demonstrate how the <b>profiling</b> <b>information</b> can be used to improve the reliability of biologically plausible SNN simulation...|$|R
