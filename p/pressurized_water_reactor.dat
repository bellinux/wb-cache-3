The Ikata Nuclear Power Plant has two Mitsubishi 538 MWe <b>Pressurized</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Reactor</b> units with the Two Reactor Coolant Loop design (similar to the {{original}} Westinghouse design at Prairie Island, Kewaunee, and Point Beach plants) and one Mitsubishi <b>Pressurized</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Reactor</b> unit with the Three Reactor Coolant Loop design (similar to the Westinghouse Surry, North Anna, and Robinson plants). Units 1 and 2 started up on September 30, 1977 and March 19, 1981 respectively. Unit 3 is a three loop PWR rated at 846 MWe that started up on December 15, 1994.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{success of}} the <b>pressurized</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactor,</b> he wrote, was due less to any superior characteristics of water, but rather to the decision to power the prototype of the Mark I submarine thermal reactor with a pressurized version of the Materials Testing Reactor at Oak Ridge. Once pressurized water was established, other possibilities became too expensive to pursue, but Weinberg remained interested in other possibilities. According to Freeman Dyson, {{he was the only}} nuclear pioneer who supported the wide universe of reactor designs.|$|E
5|$|The Three Mile Island {{power station}} is near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in the United States.

Unit 2's <b>pressurized</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactor</b> was of 900 MWe capacity. The scope and complexity of this reactor accident became clear {{over the course of}} five days, as a number of agencies at the local, state and federal levels tried to solve the problem and decide whether the ongoing accident required an emergency evacuation, and to what extent.|$|E

5|$|This {{exothermic}} reaction is very slow below 100°C, but at temperature above 900°C {{the reaction is}} rapid. Most metals undergo similar reactions. The redox reaction is relevant to the instability of fuel assemblies at high temperatures. This reaction was responsible for a small hydrogen explosion first observed inside the reactor building of Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in 1979, but at that time, the containment building was not damaged. The same reaction occurred in the reactors 1, 2 and 3 of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant (Japan) after the reactor cooling was interrupted by the earthquake and tsunami disaster of March 11, 2011 leading to the Fukushima I nuclear accidents. After venting the hydrogen in the maintenance hall of those three reactors, the mixture of hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen exploded, severely damaging the installations {{and at least one}} of the containment buildings. To avoid explosion, the direct venting of hydrogen to the open atmosphere would have been a preferred design option. Now, to prevent the risk of explosion in many <b>pressurized</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactor</b> (PWR) containment buildings, a catalyst-based recombinator is installed that converts hydrogen and oxygen into water at room temperature before the hazard arises.|$|E

25|$|The {{water level}} in the steam {{generator}} and nuclear reactor is controlled using the feedwater system.

25|$|In {{the case}} of a <b>pressurized</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactor,</b> the steam turbine is {{separated}} from the nuclear system. To detect a leak in the steam generator and thus the passage of radioactive water at an early stage, an activity meter is mounted to track the outlet steam of the steam generator. In contrast, boiling water reactors pass radioactive water through the steam turbine, so the turbine is kept as part of the radiologically controlled area of the nuclear power station.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the approach, {{these effects}} may be {{higher or lower}} than typical fission {{reactors}} like the <b>pressurized</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactor</b> (PWR). One estimate put the radiation at 100 times the (PWR). Materials need to be selected or developed that can withstand these basic conditions.

There is also a need for materials whose primary components and impurities do not result in long-lived radioactive wastes.|$|E
25|$|These {{reactors}} use {{a pressure}} vessel {{to contain the}} nuclear fuel, control rods, moderator, and coolant. They are cooled and moderated by high-pressure liquid water. The hot radioactive water that leaves the pressure vessel is looped through a steam generator, which in turn heats a secondary (non-radioactive) loop of water to steam that can run turbines. They are the majority of current reactors.
