40|$|Hip {{fracture}} is {{a common}} and potentially serious problem for the elderly. At least 90 % of hip injuries (especially fractures) in older people are caused by falls resulting in direct impact to the hip area. 1 - 3 Hip <b>protectors</b> are devices worn over the hip and upper thigh {{that are designed to}} reduce the risk for hip injury by reducing impact forces on the hip. Two different types of hip <b>protectors</b> are available: hard hip <b>protectors</b> that shunt impact forces into the surrounding tissues, and soft hip <b>protectors</b> that absorb the energy of impacts. 2 Biomechanical models suggest soft hip <b>protectors</b> may offer greater force attenuation than hard shell varieties. 4, 5 Systematic reviews combining data on the different types of hip <b>protectors</b> suggest that especially in institutions (e. g., nursing homes), the use of hip <b>protectors</b> reduces the risk of fracture by 20 % to 60 %; 6 - 8 however, hip <b>protectors</b> have not been found universally effective in all trials, 9, 10 particularly among people living at home. Also, these reviews did not make comparisons between individual types of hip <b>protectors</b> (e. g., hard versus soft, or between specific brands).

To determine acceptability {{and compliance}} with hip <b>protectors</b> in women {{at high risk of}} hip fracture who are living independently in the community. Methods. Women aged 65 yr and over referred for open access bone densitometry who had femoral neck osteoporosis and a high risk of falling were asked to wear hip <b>protectors.</b> Results. Eighty five women fulfilled the inclusion criteria of whom 32 (38 %) found the hip <b>protectors</b> acceptable and agreed to participate. Reasons given by the remaining 53 (62 %) for not finding the hip <b>protectors</b> acceptable included discomfort on wearing, dislike of their personal appearance with the hip <b>protectors</b> on, and disagreement about their fracture risk. Participants {{were more likely to have}} a family history of osteoporosis (47 vs 26 %, respectively) and hip fracture (16 vs 8 %) compared with non-participants. At 12 months only about half of the subjects were wearing hip <b>protectors</b> daily. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that only a minority of community-dwelling women at high risk of hip fracture will wear hip <b>protectors</b> to reduce fracture risk. Their use should be restricted to highly motivated women who should be carefully identified...|$|R

Previous researches on hip <b>protectors</b> focus on its functionality. Various materials, such as foam pads, plastic shields, or a combination of materials, are used to enhance its protective properties. Nevertheless, limited attention is paid on the comfort level and convenience, which are the major concerns of the wearers. This contributes to low acceptance of hip <b>protectors.</b> This consequently shows a need for developing hip <b>protectors</b> those fulfilling needs or wearers from fitting, comfort and aesthetics. To addressing the challenges, this study aims to study hip <b>protectors</b> with a design approach to halve existing problems of current hip <b>protectors.</b> After investigating several types of protective materials based on their performance and comfort level, 3 D spacer fabrics are utilized for developing hip <b>protectors</b> due to its relatively superior physical properties. Then, various apparel technologies, including cutting, edge finishing and sewing, are adopted to optimize the comfort and the appearance of the hip <b>protectors.</b> Both subjective and objective testing is carried out to evaluate the new developed hip <b>protectors.</b> Eventually, a collection of hip <b>protectors</b> is designed with a well balance on its functionality and comfort level. It is expected that the development of this hip <b>protectors</b> will bring countless benefits to people who are at high risk of falls. In addition, the design approach used can be extended to other potential protective apparel applications, and it also may arouse researchers' or product developers' awareness towards the aesthetics needs.

40|$|Hip {{fractures}} {{among older}} adults living in long-term care (LTC) are debilitating and costly, and are nearly always caused by falls. If worn {{at the time}} of falling, specific types of hip <b>protectors</b> reduce fracture risk by 80 %. However, the clinical value of hip <b>protectors</b> is compromised by poor user adherence in the wearing of these devices. My thesis provides insight into the factors governing adherence with hip <b>protectors</b> in LTC. In my first study, I conducted a systematic review of extant literature. A total of 1086 articles were identified, and of these, 28 met our inclusion criteria. Barriers and facilitators were grouped into four taxonomies: (i) system-related; (ii) caregiver-related; (iii) resident-related; (iv) hip protector-related. My second study involved the development and validation of the C-HiP index to measure commitment to hip <b>protectors</b> amongst paid care providers in LTC. Exploratory factor analysis yielded a factor structure consisting of two lower-order factors and a single higher-order factor. Expert evaluation by LTC clinicians provided evidence of content validity. Internal consistency was high (Cronbach’s alpha= 0. 96). My third study identified social ecological determinants of commitment to hip <b>protectors</b> by means of a cross-sectional survey (n= 529). Mean (SD) commitment was 4. 15 (0. 71) out of 5. 00. Commitment was associated with race/ethnicity, occupation, organizational tenure, awareness of a padded hip fracture, familiarity of hip <b>protectors,</b> perceptions of transformational leadership, communication, resident-provider relationship quality, and the existence of a champion of hip <b>protectors</b> within the home. Finally, I conducted a 12 -month retrospective cohort study in fourteen publically subsidized LTC homes to identify factors governing adherence with hip <b>protectors,</b> and to examine the clinical value of hip <b>protectors</b> to prevent hip fractures. The percentage of residents who wore hip <b>protectors</b> during at least one fall was negatively correlated with regional socioeconomic deprivation (ρ=- 0. 630) and the percentage of residents with depression (ρ=- 0. 538), and was positively correlated with the percentage of residents paying for care privately (ρ= 0. 539) and who fractured their hip in the past 180 days (ρ= 0. 677). The relative risk of hip fracture was 0. 36 (95 % CI 0. 14 – 0. 90) in falls with hip <b>protectors</b> compared to falls without hip <b>protectors...</b>|$|R
