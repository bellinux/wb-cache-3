The {{aim of this}} study is to describe causes of single injury incidents among pedestrians and bicyclists and to identify <b>preventive</b> <b>strategies.</b> The study is based on data from the injury registration database at the University Hospital in Umeå and from a complementary questionnaire containing questions regarding the causes of injury and <b>preventive</b> <b>strategies.</b> The questionnaire was distributed to all pedestrians and bicyclists injured in single incidents in a city in northern Sweden and who had visited the hospital in 2009 because of those injuries. The data set is comprised of medical data for all 367 patients (244 pedestrian and 123 bicyclists) who responded to the questionnaire. The results from this study show that the pedestrians and bicyclists differ in their reports regarding causes of their injuries and the differences seem to be related to injury severity. The pedestrians mainly referred to environmental factors as causes to their injuries, while the bicyclists referred to environmental factors, product factors, and human factors as causes of the injury incident.

40|$|Musculoskeletal {{disorders}} (MSD) at {{the workplace}} cost a lot. These MSD, {{low back pain}} in particular, {{can be caused by}} exposure to whole body vibration (WBV). <b>Preventive</b> <b>strategies</b> to reduce vibration exposure may contribute to a decrease in MSD. Therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} explore which evidence-based <b>preventive</b> <b>strategies</b> reduce vibration exposure on drivers. A systematic literature search was performed using the following key words and synonyms: Whole body vibration, occupational, and prevention. Preliminary, inclusion and selection criteria were defined. 37 studies were included: 15 laboratory studies, 17 field studies, 4 laboratory/field studies and I intervention study. Only one, the intervention study, described an intervention strategy to reduce WBV exposure in the workplace. All other studies only presented factors that have effects on vibration exposure. These factors are categorized into two different categories: (1) design considerations and (2) skills and behavior. Most studies focus on factors within category (1) while factors within category (2) may be promising as well, as these factors are often less expensive and more easy to implement. Factors from both categories should be combined in <b>preventive</b> <b>strategies</b> as there is a lack of evidence of effective <b>preventive</b> <b>strategies</b> to reduce vibration exposure on drivers. This might lead to a decrease in the incidence of low back pain due to exposure to whole body vibration. Relevance to industry This review provides employers, occupational health physicians and interested research groups with an overview of successful factors to reduce vibration exposure to drivers. The <b>preventive</b> <b>strategies,</b> which are needed to reduce low back pain problems due to WBV, should be based on these factors when developed in the near future. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} how often surgeons use strategies {{to prevent the}} transmission of bloodborne diseases and what factors {{are associated with the}} use of these strategies. DESIGN: Cross-sectional mail survey. SETTING: Secondary and tertiary care teaching hospitals affiliated with the University of Toronto. PARTICIPANTS: Of 539 active surgical staff and residents who were eligible, 503 (93. 3 %) responded. OUTCOME MEASURES: Current preventive practices, attitudes toward transmission of bloodborne diseases, perceived risk of infection and willingness to adopt <b>preventive</b> <b>strategies.</b> RESULTS: On average, surgeons reported using double- or triple-gloving in 32. 2 % of procedures, facial protection (including regular corrective eyewear) in 74. 2 % and goggles or face shields in 19. 4 %. Use of strategies to prevent sharp injuries, in addition to barrier precautions, was reported by 259 (51. 5 %) of the respondents. Factors associated with greater use of <b>preventive</b> <b>strategies</b> included resident position, subspecialty, greater number of years in surgical practice and a high perceived risk. Most of the respondents thought that patients should be routinely screened for HIV antibodies before surgery (68. 2 % [343 / 503]), that there was too little research into ways to reduce the risk of transmission of bloodborne diseases (55. 3 % [278 / 503]) and that there was too little effort on the part of organizations to reduce the risk of transmission (58. 8 % [296 / 503]). The perceived lifetime risk was reported to be moderate or high by 191 (38. 0 %) of the respondents and low or insignificant by 308 (61. 2 %). In all, 463 (92. 0 %) indicated a willingness to change the way they performed surgery to prevent transmission of bloodborne diseases. CONCLUSION: Surgeons expressed varying degrees of concern about the transmission of bloodborne diseases and reported infrequent use of <b>preventive</b> <b>strategies.</b> Efforts to reduce the risk of transmission between patients and surgeons will need to include informing surgeons of their personal risk and the availability of <b>preventive</b> <b>strategies,</b> improving the comfort of barrier precautions and minimizing how <b>preventive</b> <b>strategies</b> interfere with surgery...|$|R

Aim: Determine optimal use of erythropoietin and ribavirin, compare ribavirin concentrations with those of HCV patients having normal renal function and evaluate SVR in a prospective observatory of ESRD candidates for renal transplantation. Methods: Thirty-two naïve patients were treated with Peg-IFN-α 2 a and ribavirin. Two different schedules of ribavirin and EPO administration were used: starting ribavirin at 600 mg per week and adapting EPO when hemoglobin fell below 10 g/dL (adaptive strategy), or starting ribavirin at 1, 000 mg per week while increasing EPO {{from the start of}} treatment (<b>preventive</b> <b>strategy).</b> Results: Patients treated with the adaptive strategy had lower median hemoglobin levels (9. 6 vs. 10. 9 g/dL, p= 0. 02) and more frequently median Hb levels below 10 g/dL (58 vs. 5 %, p= 0. 0007) despite lower median ribavirin doses (105 vs. 142 mg/day, p< 0. 0001) than patients treated with the <b>preventive</b> <b>strategy.</b> There was a trend for more frequent transfusion in patients treated with the adaptive strategy than in patients treated with <b>preventive</b> <b>strategy</b> (50 vs. 20 %, p= 0. 08). Compared to patients with normal renal function, ESRD patients had lower ribavirin concentrations during the first month (0. 81 vs. 1. 7 mg/l, p= 0. 007) and similar concentrations thereafter. SVR was reached in 50 %. Conclusions: Peg-IFN and an adapted schedule of ribavirin are effective in ESRD patients. Increasing EPO from the start of treatment provides better hematological tolerance.
