50|$|Various {{types of}} <b>drafting</b> <b>machine</b> may be {{attached}} to the board surface to assist the draftsperson or artist. Parallel rules often span the entire width of the board and are so named because they remain parallel to the top edge of the board as they are moved up and down. <b>Drafting</b> <b>machines</b> use pre-calibrated scales and built in protractors to allow accurate drawing measurement.|$|R
50|$|A <b>drafting</b> <b>machine</b> is {{a device}} which is mounted {{to the drawing}} board. It has rulers whose angles can be {{precisely}} adjusted with a controlling mechanism.|$|R
50|$|With the {{development}} of computer-aided design (CAD), the use of <b>drafting</b> <b>machines,</b> especially in the professional sector, has drastically declined, supplanted first by pen plotters, and then by large-format inkjet printers.|$|R

50|$|With the <b>drafting</b> <b>machine</b> one {{can perform}} {{a series of}} drawing {{operations}} that otherwise could only be achieved with a much more complex use of the classic ruler square and protractor, as, for example, drawing parallel lines, orthogonal lines, inclined lines according to a preset angle, measurement of angles, etc.|$|R
50|$|A <b>drafting</b> <b>machine</b> allows easy {{drawing of}} {{parallel}} lines over the paper. The adjustable angle between the rulers allows the lines {{to be drawn}} in varying accurate angles. Rulers may {{also be used as}} a support for separate special rulers and letter templates. The rules are replaceable and they can be for example scale-rules.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, steel {{detailing}} {{was accomplished}} via manual drafting methods, using pencils, paper, and drafting {{tools such as}} a parallel bar or <b>drafting</b> <b>machine,</b> triangles, templates of circles and other useful shapes, and mathematical tables, such as tables of logarithms and other useful calculational aids. Eventually, hand held calculators were incorporated into the traditional practice.|$|R

40|$|The {{existing}} Caad systems limit designers creativity by constraining them to {{work with}} prototypes provided by the system's knowledge base. Most think of computers as <b>drafting</b> <b>machines</b> and consider CAAD models as merely proposals for future buildings. But this kind of thinking (computers as simple <b>drafting</b> <b>machines)</b> {{seems to be a}} way without future. New media demands new process and new process demands new media. We have to give some thougt to impact of CAAD on the design process and in which part of it CAAD can add new value. In this paper there will be considered two ways of using of computers. First - creation of architectural form in an architect's mind and projects visualisation with using renderings, animation and virtual reality. In the second part - computer techniques are investigated as a medium of creation. Unlike a conventional drawing the design object within computer has a life of its own. In computer space design and the final product are one. Computer creates environments for new kind of design activities. In fact, many dimensions of meaning in cyberspace have led to a cyberreal architecture that is sure to have dramatic consequences for the profession...|$|R
50|$|Digigraphics {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{graphical}} computer aided design systems to go on sale. Originally developed at Itek on the PDP-1 as EDM (Electronic <b>Drafting</b> <b>Machine),</b> the efforts were purchased by Control Data Corporation and ported to their machines, along with a new graphics terminal to support it. Systems cost almost $500,000 and supported only a few users at a time, so in spite of a number of advantages it was not cost competitive with traditional manual methods and only a few systems were sold.|$|R
50|$|The {{mold cavity}} of a casting {{does not reflect}} the exact {{dimensions}} of the finished part due to a number of reasons. These modifications to the mold cavity are known as allowances and account for patternmaker's shrinkage, <b>draft,</b> <b>machining,</b> and distortion. In non-expendable processes, these allowances are imparted directly into the permanent mold, but in expendable mold processes they are imparted into the patterns, which later form the mold cavity. Note that for non-expendable molds an allowance is required for the dimensional change of the mold due to heating to operating temperatures.|$|R

Initially rubylith was manually separated according to the engineers design parameters, and later automated via diamond-tip equipped x-y <b>drafting</b> <b>machines</b> driven by NC tape systems or direct computer output at {{the initial stages of}} the CAD revolution. Subsequently the artwork was photographically reduced. A similar process was used for early integrated circuits.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of apparatus: an arm-type {{parallelogram}} apparatus based on a hinged arm; and a track-type apparatus which moves on a rail mounted {{to the top of}} the drawing board. The accuracy of the arm type apparatus is better in the middle of the board, decreasing towards the edges, whereas a track machine has a constant accuracy over the whole board. The drawing head of a track-type <b>drafting</b> <b>machine</b> slides on bearings in a vertical rail, which in turn is moved along a horizontal, top-mounted rail. Both apparatus types have an adjustable drawing-head with rules attached to a protractor scale so that the angle of the rules may be adjusted.|$|R
5000|$|... "Parallel lines" [...] can {{be drawn}} simply by moving the T-square and running a pencil or {{technical}} pen along the T-square's edge. The T-square is used to hold other devices such as set squares or triangles. In this case, the drafter places one or more triangles of known angles on the T-square—which is itself {{at right angles to}} the edge of the table—and can then draw lines at any chosen angle to others on the page. Modern drafting tables come equipped with a <b>drafting</b> <b>machine</b> that is supported on both sides of the table to slide over a large piece of paper. Because it is secured on both sides, lines drawn along the edge are guaranteed to be parallel.|$|R

50|$|A T-square is a {{straightedge}} {{which uses}} {{the edge of}} the drawing board as a support. It is used with the drafting board to draw horizontal lines and to align other drawing instruments. Wooden, metal, or plastic triangles with 30° and 60° angles or with two 45° angles are used to speed drawing of lines at these commonly used angles. A continuously adjustable 0-90° protractor is also in use. An alternative to the T-square is the parallel bar which is permanently attached to the drawing board. It has a set of cables and pulleys to allow it to be positioned anywhere on the drawing surface while still remaining parallel {{to the bottom of the}} board. The <b>drafting</b> <b>machine</b> replaces the T-square and triangles.|$|R
50|$|In 1971 Hanratty founded Manufacturing and Consulting Services (MCS), {{applying}} what he {{had learned}} at ICS. All the software was written in Fortran and it ran on almost any computer. His product was named Automated <b>Drafting</b> and <b>Machining</b> (ADAM), later AD-2000, and still later Anvil-4000. This package was very successful.|$|R
5000|$|Some of {{the tools}} of manual {{drafting}} include pencils, pens and their ink, straightedges, T-squares, French curves, triangles, rulers, protractors, dividers, compasses, scales, erasers, and tacks or push pins. (Slide rules used to number among the supplies, too, but nowadays even manual drafting, when it occurs, benefits from a pocket calculator or its onscreen equivalent.) And of course the tools also include drawing boards (drafting boards) or tables. The English idiom [...] "to {{go back to the}} drawing board", which is a figurative phrase meaning to rethink something altogether, was inspired by the literal act of discovering design errors during production and returning to a drawing board to revise the engineering drawing. <b>Drafting</b> <b>machines</b> are devices that aid manual drafting by combining drawing boards, straightedges, pantographs, and other tools into one integrated drawing environment. CAD provides their virtual equivalents.|$|R
