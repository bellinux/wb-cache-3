40|$|Arthrobacter oxydans P 52 {{isolated}} from soil samples {{was found to}} degrade the phenylcarbamate herbicides <b>phenmedipham</b> and desmedipham cometabolically by hydrolyzing their central carbamate linkages. The phenylcarbamate hydrolase (<b>phenmedipham</b> hydrolase) responsible for the degradative reaction was purified to homogeneity. The enzyme was {{shown to be a}} monomer with a molecular weight of 55, 000. A 41 -kb wild-type plasmid (pHP 52) was identified in A. oxydans P 52, but not in a derivative of this strain that had spontaneously lost the ability to hydrolyze phenylcarbamates, indicating that the gene for phenylcarbamate degradation (pcd) is plasmid encoded. Determination of two partial amino acid sequences allowed the localization of the coding sequence of the pcd gene on a 3. 3 -kb PstI restriction fragment within pHP 52 DNA by hybridization with synthetic oligonucleotides. The phenylcarbamate hydrolase was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli under control of the lacZ promoter after the 3. 3 -kb PstI fragment was subcloned into the vector pUC 19. A stretch of 1, 864 bases within the cloned Pst fragment was sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1, 479 bases containing the amino acid partial sequences determined for the purified enzyme. Sequence comparisons revealed significant homology between the pcd gene product and the amino acid sequences of esterases of eukaryotic origin.

40|$|Abstract Background, Aims, and Scope The springtail Folsomia candida is a {{commonly}} used model species in ecotoxicological soil testing. The species reproduces parthenogenetically and, thus, laboratories use different clonal lineages. In this study, we investigated if genetic divergence between F. candida strains impacts {{the reaction to}} chemical stress and may thus affect the outcome of toxicity tests. Methods In two exposure assays (life-cycle reproduction test and avoidance behaviour test), three laboratory strains of F. candida from Portugal (PTG), Spain (SPN) and Denmark (DNK) were exposed to different concentrations of the reference chemical <b>phenmedipham.</b> Genetic divergence among strains was estimated based on mitochondrial COI sequence data. Results No significant differences between tolerance towards <b>phenmedipham</b> exposure were observed in a reproduction test. In contrast, one strain (SPN) showed a decreased susceptibility to <b>phenmedipham</b> {{compared to the other}} strains (PTG and DNK) in the avoidance assay. Discussion A phylogenetic tree based on mitochondrial COI sequences revealed clear genetic differentiation between both ‘reaction types’. Thus, we found a potential lineage dependent stress reaction in avoidance behaviour towards the pesticide. Conclusions Our findings have implications for the comparability of test results among laboratories. Reproduction tests seem to be more robust towards interclonal genetic differentiation than avoidance tests. Recommendations and Perspectives We recommend the use of molecular tools for simple and cost effective genetic characterization of F. candida strains used in chemical avoidance tests. Closer investigations concerning the relation between genetic relatedness and chemical response will provide a more detailed and comprehensive picture on the role of intraspecific genetic differentiation in stress tolerance.

40|$|Enchytraeus albidus are {{important}} organisms {{of the soil}} biocenosis, used as standard test species in environmental risk assessment. The inhibition of cholinesterases (ChE) activity of several species has been widely {{used to assess the}} exposure and effects of anti-cholinesterase environmental contaminants. Several studies have shown the association between ChE activity inhibition and adverse effects on behaviour and survival. Extensive studies addressing survival and behavioural endpoints, as well as other biomarkers, have been done in E. albidus with different types of soil contaminants. The main objectives of this study were: (1) to characterize biochemically the ChE present in the soluble post-mitochondrial fraction of E. albidus whole body homogenates, using different substrates and selective inhibitors; (2) to assess the in vivo effects of copper, <b>phenmedipham</b> and different soil properties (pH, organic matter, clay) on the ChE activity; (3) to assess the in vitro effects of copper and <b>phenmedipham</b> on the ChE activity. The results suggest the presence of one ChE in the soluble post-mitochondrial fraction of E. albidus whole body homogenates, which displays properties of both acetylcholinesterase and pseudocholinesterase considering the typical mammalian enzymes. It is also shown that ChE activity is not inhibited by exposure to different soil properties and that copper and <b>phenmedipham</b> inhibited ChE activity both in in vivo and in in vitro conditions and therefore ChE inhibition seems to be a robust biomarker for this herbicide and this heavy metal. This study showed that ChE activity in E. albidus might be correlated to previously determined higher level effects like survival and reproduction, as well as avoidance behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The main {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the toxicity of two reference chemicals, Carbendazim and <b>Phenmedipham,</b> for the compostworm Eisenia andrei (effects of Carbendazim) and the potworm Enchytraeus crypticus (effects of <b>Phenmedipham)</b> in 12 Mediterranean soils with contrasting soil properties. The observed toxicity was also compared to that obtained for OECD standard soil, used as a control. Materials and methods The soils were selected to be representative for the Mediterranean region and to cover a broad range of soil properties. The evaluated endpoints were avoidance behavior and reproduction. Soils were also assembled in two groups according to their pedological properties. Results and discussion Toxicity benchmarks (AC 50 s) obtained for E. andrei avoidance behavior in carbendazim-contaminated soils were generally higher for sandy soils with low pH. The toxic effects on the reproduction of the compostworms were similar in the six tested soils, indicating a low influence of soil properties. The avoidance response of E. crypticus towards <b>Phenmedipham</b> was generally highly variable in all tested soils. Even though, a higher toxicity was observed for more acidic soils. The EC 50 s for reproduction of the latter species varied by a factor of 9 and <b>Phenmedipham</b> toxicity also tended to be increasing in soils with lower pH, except for the soils with extreme organic matter content (0. 6 and 5. 8 %). Conclusions A soil effect on chemical toxicity was clearly confirmed, highlighting the influence that test soils can have in site-specific ecological risk assessment. Despite some relationships between soil properties and toxicity were outlined, a clear and statistically significant prediction of chemical toxicity could not be established. The range of soil properties was probably narrow to give clearer and more consistent insights on their influence. For the four groups of tests, the toxicity observed for OECD soil was either similar, lower, or generally higher if compared with Mediterranean soils. Moreover, it did represent neither the organic matter content found in Mediterranean soils nor their textural classes.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} pre-spraying growing conditions on herbicide efficacy, two years of experimentation were conducted in which Persicaria maculosa plants were exposed to different light intensities for 1 ¿ 4 days before metribuzin treatment. Specific leaf area, rather than plant growth rate or plant size, was the only parameter that correlated well with herbicide efficacy in both years of experimentation. The negative relationship between the ED 50 and the specific leaf area indicates that leaf characteristics might be an important determinant of herbicide efficacy, for instance through an effect on herbicide uptake. In {{the third year of}} experimentation this hypothesis was further investigated by raising six cohorts of weed plants at a 1 -week interval and thus exposing them to a range of weather conditions. Clear relationships between uptake and herbicide efficacy were found for a combination of four plant species (Solanum nigrum, Senecio vulgaris, Chenopodium album and Brassica napus) and two herbicides (<b>phenmedipham</b> and bentazone). For <b>phenmedipham,</b> uptake was negatively correlated with global radiation and positively correlated with relative humidity. For the herbicide bentazone the opposite was found. These results were not species-specific. This study shows the importance of the sensitivity of herbicide × species combinations and indicates that pre-spraying weather information is relevant for the development of reduced dose rate recommendations...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{a higher}} {{proportion}} of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in sugar beet rotations, volunteer oilseed rape can occur in increased numbers in subsequent crops. The sulfonylurea triflusulfuron is widely used for broad-leaved weed control in sugar beet, but may no longer be effective to control imidazolinone-tolerant volunteers when imidazolinone-tolerant oilseed rape is grown, which is due to a cross-tolerance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides. Aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate six different herbicide strategies for the control of tolerant volunteer oilseed rape. As a result, imidazolinone-tolerant oilseed rape showed a distinctive cross-resistance to triflusulfuron in the field. Mean herbicide efficacy was 14 % and was only slightly increased by combination with metamitron. Imidazolinone-susceptible and -tolerant oilseed rape varieties showed different response to the herbicide treatments. A significantly higher reduction of plant fresh mass (shoot) > 90 % was caused by herbicide treatments that included the active ingredients desmedipham, <b>phenmedipham,</b> ethofumesate, chloridazon and quinmerac. The results showed that triflusulfuron is no longer suitable to control volunteers if they are derived from imidazolinone-tolerance expressing varieties. However, alternative herbicides are available. Generally, increased attention has to be paid to volunteer management within the whole crop rotation if imidazolinonetolerant oilseed rape is grown. Appropriate tillage strategies after oilseed rape harvest have to be followed by effective herbicide treatments in the subsequent sugar beet, for example a mixture of metamitron, <b>phenmedipham,</b> desmedipham, ethofumesat and lenaciel...|$|E

Treatments included untreated control and several rates of desmedipham + <b>phenmedipham</b> + ethofumesate, chloridazon and clopyralid on Portulaca oleracea, Solanum nigrum, Amaranthus retroflexus and Chenopodium album. A completely randomized layout with three replications was used for each herbicide. Three weeks after spraying (WAS), plants were harvested and measured their dry weight. These herbicides were more effective to control Portulaca oleracea than other weeds, thereupon minimum dose required for a satisfactory efficacy of 90 % {{reduction of}} Portulaca oleracea aboveground dry matter (ED 90) were 299. 22, 1138. 31 and 129. 44 g a. i ha- 1 of desmedipham + <b>phenmedipham</b> + ethofumesate, chloridazon and clopyralid, respectively. Solanum nigrum was more affected by clopyralid application (132. 40 g a. i ha- 1), and did not make significant difference in Portulaca oleracea. Chloridazon had lower effect for control of Chenopodium album due to existence of powdery covering on abaxial side of the leaves. Biomass ED 50 or ED 90, based on log-logistic dose–response curves, for Chenopodium album was considerably higher than other species.

For the control of classical weed societies farmers can fall back on a limited number of active ingredients. Generally, <b>Phenmedipham</b> (PMP), Desmedipham (DMP) and Ethofumesate are the basis of a spray sequence. They are complemented with other active ingredients depending on the specific weed situation. The newly formulated BELVEDERE® Extra combines the three mentioned active ingredients in an optimal ratio.

40|$|Soil {{ecotoxicology}} {{studies are}} usually performed in standard soils such as Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development artificial soil or LUFA ST. 2. 2, a natural soil. When assessing the toxic {{effects in the}} environment, soil properties are often different from those in standard soils, which {{might lead to a}} different exposure situation for the test species and therefore to misleading conclusions. Selected to cover a broad range of properties and based on the Euro-Soils concept, 17 different soils were studied regarding their suitability to two test species: Folsomia candida and Hypogastrura assimilis (Collembola). In reproduction tests, the test species reacted differently to the soils. F. candida was less affected by soil properties: 500 to 1200 juveniles/vessel were found in untreated soils (i. e., controls). These differences can be attributed to normal interindividual variability. H. assimilis showed a significant correlation with maximum water-holding capacity and also a tendency to lower the reproductive output in soils with a low pH (< 4). Therefore, some soils were revealed to be inappropriate for tests with H. assimilis. In the main tests, the effect of the reference test substance <b>Phenmedipham</b> (formulation Betosyp) was studied in those soils where sufficient reproduction was determined beforehand. Clearly, the chronic end point was more sensitive than survival when testing <b>Phenmedipham.</b> In H. assimilis, because of high variability and low effects in the tested dosages, no conclusions could be drawn. In F. candida, different soils caused different toxic effects: Juveniles preferred soils with high C-to-N ratios. Higher microbial activity might support a quicker metabolization of the test substance. In general, the toxic response is caused by a synergistic action of several soil properties with each of them exerting an effect too small to be clarified with the available set of data.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{the results of}} over fifteen years of {{experimentation}} are summarized, concerning the possibility of use of herbicides included in several chemical classes and with various mechanisms of action on poplar clones of different species, European and North American. The active ingredients were tested mainly singly or in commercial mixtures as well, applied before emergence (interpreted here as sprout of poplar cuttings not yet occurred and before weed infestation) or after emergence (interpreted here as cuttings with sprouts 20 - 25 cm long and after weed colonisation). Almost 50 % of the 43 tested formulations {{has proved to be}} unserviceable in poplar nursery because of the hard damage induced on plantlets, i. e. dicotyledonicides and those with a wide action range, especially applied after emergence. It was the case of acetolactate synthase inhibitors and synthetic auxins. About 25 % of formulations has proved to be utilizable with limited risks and 20 % without risk. After emergence, the lowest damage was caused by graminicide compounds included in the class of acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitors (e. g. diclofop-methyl, cycloxydim); before emergence, very good applicative opportunities were showed by microtubule assembly inhibitors, especially propyzamide, and the cellulose synthesis inhibitor isoxaben. Among the herbicides utilizable with some risk after emergence, the photosynthesis inhibitors pyridate and <b>phenmedipham</b> (singly or in mixture) were interesting since they are the only ones that allow the control of broad-leaved weeds in the presence of herbaceous poplar shoots. Before emergence, flufenacet and isoxaflutole were remarkable as well, the latter being active versus hardly limited weeds.

The parameters measured in E. albidus whole body were: lipid peroxidation (LPO), total glutathione (TG), as well as the enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione S-transferase (GST). The results showed that biomarker responses in E. albidus were significantly affected by the soil type (GST CAT, GPx, GR and LPO) and the duration of exposure in OECD artificial soil (GST, GPx, GR, CAT and LPO) but not in LUFA 2. 2 natural soil. For the abiotic factors studied, after 2 days, low pH decreased significantly the TG levels and the activities of CAT and GR,and low OM also significantly decreased CAT and GR activities. After 3 weeks, differences in soil properties caused a decrease in GR and GPx activities, whereas increased M activity was observed due to low organic matter and pH. Copper significantly increased the activities of CAT, GPx and GR, and decreased the activity of GST after 2 days as well as inscreasing LPO levels after 3 weeks. <b>Phenmedipham</b> increased LPO levels, associated with increased levels of TG as well as increased activities of CAT and GPx and decreased GST activity after 3 weeks exposure. This study shows that both abiotic and chemical stresses could be followed through biomarker analysis and that some of these determinations are potential endpoints in a quick soil contamination assessment procedure.

The main aim of this study was the development of a DNA microarray for Enchytraeus albidus, a common soil worm species. Further, this microarray was tested using worms exposed to Cu, <b>phenmedipham,</b> and different soil types. Hybridization onto the developed microarray revealed several genes with homology to known sequences. Genes of interest were confirmed through real-time polymerase chain reaction. It was possible to discriminate between natural and chemical stressors and chemical concentrations. Gene responses were detected under conditions known to have effects in the reproduction of individuals. It was confirmed that the integration of different endpoints improves the assessment process and enhances the understanding of the modes of action of stressors. The chemical stress-induced genes were related to factors such as immune response, stress response, metabolic processes, and/or signal transduction. The present study represents the first step of a gene-level study in the ecologically relevant and standard test species E. albidus.

Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were carried out against two broad of weeds to describe how the Kautsky curve and its parameters were affected by herbicides.

40|$|Enchytraeids (Enchytraeus albidus) {{directly}} {{improve the}} pore {{structure of the}} soil and are indirectly involved in regulating the degradation of organic matter. Due to their behavior {{they are able to}} avoid unfavorable environmental conditions. Avoidance tests allow a first assessment of toxicity of a contaminated or spiked soil within 48 h, by using the reaction of the enchytraeids as measurement endpoint. In this period, the organisms can choose between the control soil and the test soil. In the tests reported here, enchytraeids were exposed to LUFA 2. 2 soil spiked with the following set of toxic substances: copper chloride, zinc chloride, cadmium chloride, <b>phenmedipham,</b> benomyl, carbendazim, dimethoate, atrazine, pentachlorophenol, chlorpyriphos, lindane, TBTO, Linear Alkylbenzene Sulfonates (LAS) and boric acid. Different chemical concentrations were tested. EC(50) s ranged from 8 mg/kg (Carbendazim) to > 1000 mg/kg (e. g. LAS). While the tested heavy metals showed clear dose-response relationships, the effect pattern differed considerably in the tests with organic chemicals, e. g. no avoidance behaviour was observed in LAS, even at very high doses.

40|$|Purpose: Soil {{properties}} {{are the main}} explanation to the different toxicities obtained in different soils, due to their influence on chemical bioavailability and the test species performance itself. However, most prediction studies are centred on a few soil properties influencing bioavailability, while their direct effects on test species performance are usually neglected. In our study we develop prediction models for the toxicity values obtained {{in a set of}} soils taking into account both the chemical concentration and their soil properties. Materials and methods: The effects on the avoidance behaviour and on reproduction of the herbicide <b>phenmedipham</b> to the collembolan Folsomia candida is assessed in twelve natural soils and the OECD artificial soil. The toxicity outcomes in the different soils are compared and explanatory models are constructed by Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) using phenm edipham concentrations and soil properties. Results and discussion: At identical phenmedip ham concentrations, the effects on reproduction and the avoidance response observed in the OECD soil were similar to those observed in natural soils, while effects on survival were clearly lower in this soil. The organic matter and silt content explained differences in the avoidance behavior in different soils; for reproduction, there was a more complex. Conclusions: Our results highlight the need for approaches taking into account all the soil properties as a whole, as a necessary step to improve the prediction of the toxicity of particular chemicals to any particular soil pattern involving several soil properties...|$|E
40|$|Enchytraeids are {{important}} inhabitants {{of a wide}} variety of soil types and suitable test organisms for environmental risk assessment through the determination of effects on survival and reproduction. In this study, the effect of pesticides with different modes of action is assessed in the standard test species Enchytraeus albidus. Main goals were: (a) to test the toxicity of a range of pesticides to E. albidus in a natural soil (LUFA 2. 2), (b) to assess whether avoidance gave a prediction of effects on the survival and reproduction, and (c) to investigate if the organisms' response to different toxics can be grouped into the respective chemical classes. Pesticides selected were the: (1) herbicides: <b>phenmedipham</b> and atrazine; (2) fungicides: carbendazim and pentachlorophenol: and (3) insecticides: dimethoate and lindane. All tested pesticides caused effects in the survival and reproduction of E. albidus and the compounds that showed a higher toxicity were carbendazim, dimethoate and atrazine. The effect concentrations were not chemical class dependent. In general, survival and reproduction showed similar response patterns. Avoidance behaviour showed trends of response similar to these other measured endpoints, but was less sensitive and more variable (data from a previous study). It was not possible to establish a clear correlation between survival, reproduction and avoidance endpoints. From an ecological point of view, avoidance tests are relevant but due to lower sensitivity and higher variability it is recommended that the enchytraeid avoidance test should not be used for risk assessment purposes.

40|$|Enchytraeids {{are typical}} {{inhabitants}} of many soils, contributing to vital processes of this environmental compartment. Indirectly {{they are involved}} in regulating the degradation of organic matter, as well as improving the pore structure of the soil. Due to their behaviour, they are able to avoid unfavourable environmental conditions. Avoidance tests with enchytraeids, initially developed with earthworms by several authors, are quick and easy to perform. With these tests a first assessment of the toxicity of a (contaminated or spiked) soil is possible in just 4 8 h by using the reaction of the enchytraeids as measurement endpoint. In this period of time the organisms can choose between the control soil and the other soil (a contaminated or spiked or another soil with different physico-chemical properties). In the tests reported h ere, the enchytraeids were exposed to control soils spiked with the fungicides Benomyl and Carbendazim and the herbicide <b>Phenmedipham.</b> Several chemical. concentrations were tested in order to evaluate the avoidance behaviour to toxic substances. In fact, often these short-term screening tests gave results showing avoidance at concentrations in a range similar to the acute test results but, higher than in chronic tests. Further tests are needed to decide whether the results gained in this study can be extrapolated to other chemicals.

The droplet size spectra were measured for these 15 spray mixtures using a Malvern Particle Sizer and characterised by the Volume Median Diameter (VMD) {{and the percentage of}} liquid contained in droplets less than 100 m (% < 100 m). Horizontal ground drift was measured in a wind tunnel, on glass fibre collectors using a fluorescent tracer dye technique. The relative drift of each spray mixture was characterised by the Drifted Part (DP) which is the part of the sprayed volume drifted between 2 and 6 metres. Although the nozzle type was the predominating parameter regarding to the droplet size spectra and the DP, differences were observed due to the liquids characteristics. The EC formulation produced a smaller droplet size and a greater DP than the SC formulation whatever the tank mix adjuvant used. For the different spray mixtures, the DP was poorly correlated to the VMD or the % < 100 m. However, correlations between the VMD, the % < 100 m and the DP of the flat-fan nozzle and of the hollow cone nozzle were significant. This suggests that a reference nozzle could be used to estimate the drift potential of other nozzle with a similar liquid sheet break-up mechanism. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{side-effects}} {{of various}} pesticides on collembolan species covering different life forms (Isotoma anglicana, Lepidocyrtus violaceus, Folsomia fimetaria, Heteromurus nitidus and Onychiurus armatus) {{were examined in}} laboratory and field experiments. The principal aim {{of the study was}} to develop choice experiments with Collembola for the quantitative assessment of avoidance behaviour. Avoidance can potentially lead to population declines due to inhibited immigration or escape from contaminated areas. One herbicide (Betanal, active ingredient <b>phenmedipham)</b> and five insecticides were tested. These included two synthetic pyrethroids (Karate, a. i. lambda-cyhalothrin and Cymbush, a. i. cypermethrin), two carbamates (Croneton, a. i. ethiofencarb and Curaterr, a. i. carbofuran) and the neem seed-kernel extract formulation NeemAzal T/S (active ingredient azadirachtin A). To determine the influence of the six pesticides on springtail mortality and mobility, acute toxicity tests over 24 hours and seven days were carried out. All pesticides except NeemAzal T/S caused inactivation of the springtails after 24 hours. Whereas the acute toxicity of Karate, Croneton, Curaterr and NeemAzal T/S could be attributed to the active ingredients, these were non-toxic in the case of Betanal and Cymbush. It is concluded that the formulations of Betanal and Cymbush contain toxic adjuvants. Effects on reproduction were assessed with F. candida. Cymbush had no adverse effect on reproduction after 28 days. All other pesticides affected reproduction with EC 50 -values below those of acute toxicity. Repellency could be stated for all six pesticides by means of choice experiments. For Betanal, Karate and Cymbush the endpoint avoidance behaviour proved to be more sensitive than reproduction. By means of the choice test behavioural reactions can be detected that could lead to an emigration of springtails out of contaminated areas and thereby affect the community structure of the biocoenosis and soil fertility. Furthermore, it provides additional, ecologically important information about side effects of pesticides on non-target organisms. Avoidance induced by vapours of the test substances was quantified using an innovative design for testing collembolan olfaction, in which O. armatus was able to detect Betanal, Croneton, Curaterr and NeemAzal T/S without direct contact. Finally, the results of the choice experiments with Betanal and Cymbush were compared with investigations in the field. For this purpose, the colonization of Betanal- and Cymbush-contaminated litterbags and -boxes by springtails was investigated. The experiments showed no significant differences between the colonization of contaminated areas and controls...|$|E

Treatments that included two or three applications of glyphosate, regardless of rate, or glyphosate applied once in combination with BAS 656 07 H or ethofumesate, resulted in 83 to 100 percent redroot pigweed, common lambsquarters and hairy nightshade control. Redroot pigweed and barnyardgrass control was lower when glyphosate was applied to cotyledon sugarbeets, with sequential applications one and two weeks later, than when glyphosate was applied to two to four leaf sugarbeets. Sugarbeet yield with glyphosate treatments was {{greater than or equal}} to the standard herbicide program used in sugarbeets. Glufosinate applied earlypostemergence or mid-postemergence resulted in 78 to 100 percent redroot pigweed, common lambsquarters, and hairy nightshade control. Glufosinate following ethofumesate applied preplant incorporated or ethofumesate applied postemergence in combination with glufosinate provided weed control similar to the standard herbicide program. Barnyardgrass control was lowest with glufosinate applied postemergence in combination with ethofumesate. Glufosinate treatments that were applied in combination with ethofumesate postemergence resulted in lower sugarbeet yields. Slight sugarbeet injury was observed early in the growing season when ethofumesate was applied postemergence. However, weed control was the main factor that affected sugarbeet yield. Treatments did not affect sugarbeet sucrose content. Field dodder control, with glyphosate, ranged from 98 to 100 percent, 42 days after treatment. Glyphosate treatments reduced dodder dry weight compared to a conventional, herbicide program of the commercial premix of desmedipham and <b>phenmedipham,</b> tank mixed with triflusulfuron, and clopyralid. Sugarbeet dry weight was greater, and dodder dry weight was lower with the conventional program compared to the untreated control and a single application of glufosinate. Three applications of glufosinate, at 0. 40 and 0. 80 kg ai/ha with 3. 4 kg ai/ha of AMS resulted in a lower dodder dry weight than three applications of glufosinate at 0. 30 kg/ha with AMS and the untreated control. Glyphosate reduced dodder growth in some cases when applied before dodder attachment to glyphosate-resistant sugarbeets. Glufosinate applied before attachment to glufosinate-resistant sugarbeets had no effect on dodder growth. Dipping a single leaf from a dodder infested sugarbeet in a glyphosate solution reduced the growth of dodder that was attached to other sugarbeet leaves on the same plant. Since glyphosate was not in contact with dodder surface, the glyphosate that caused the dodder growth reduction translocated from the treated leaf to the leaves in which dodder was attached...|$|E
