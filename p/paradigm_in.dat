5|$|Many {{language}} studies, {{particularly in}} fMRI, use the subtraction <b>paradigm,</b> <b>in</b> which brain activation in a task thought to involve {{some aspect of}} language processing is compared against activation in a baseline task thought to involve similar non-linguistic processes but not to involve the linguistic process. For example, activations while participants read words may be compared to baseline activations while participants read strings of random letters (in attempt to isolate activation related to lexical processingthe processing of real words), or activations while participants read syntactically complex sentences may be compared to baseline activations while participants read simpler sentences.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{extensively}} studied cerebellar learning tasks is the eyeblink conditioning <b>paradigm,</b> <b>in</b> which a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) such as a tone or a light is repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US), such as an air puff, that elicits a blink response. After such repeated presentations of the CS and US, the CS will eventually elicit a blink before the US, a conditioned response or CR. Experiments showed that lesions localized either to a specific part of the interposed nucleus (one of the deep cerebellar nuclei) or to a few specific points in the cerebellar cortex would abolish learning of a conditionally timed blink response. If cerebellar outputs are pharmacologically inactivated while leaving the inputs and intracellular circuits intact, learning takes place even while the animal fails to show any response, whereas, if intracerebellar circuits are disrupted, no learning takes place—these facts taken together make a strong case that the learning, indeed, occurs inside the cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{is a type}} of computation {{in which}} many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has been employed for many years, mainly in high-performance computing, but interest in it has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the dominant <b>paradigm</b> <b>in</b> computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.|$|E

40|$|In Social Work, {{the term}} {{paradigm}} {{is used to}} express a specific perspective on the discipline. There are multiple <b>paradigms</b> <b>in</b> Social Work. They {{are not in a}} hierarchical relationship to each other, rather they coexist as alternatives. In contrast, the term paradigm as introduced by Thomas Khun and used in science, assumes the existence and superiority of one the newest paradigm.

25|$|The Tübingen {{paradigm}} was formulated {{and thoroughly}} defended {{for the first}} time by Hans Joachim Krämer. He published the results of his research in a 1959 monograph that was a revised version of a 1957 dissertation written under the supervision of Wolfgang Schadewaldt. In 1963, Konrad Gaiser, who was also a student of Schadewaldt, qualified as a professor with his comprehensive monograph on the unwritten doctrines. In the following decades both these scholars expanded on and defended the new <b>paradigm</b> <b>in</b> a series of publications while teaching at Tübingen University.|$|E
25|$|Social network {{analysis}} {{is an example}} of a new <b>paradigm</b> <b>in</b> the positivist tradition.

There is also a minor revival of a more independent, empirical sociology in the spirit of C. Wright Mills, and his studies of the Power Elite in the United States of America, according to Stanley Aronowitz.|$|E

The negative effects of these socioeconomic conditions contrasted with the changes to {{the economy of the}} United States, which reflected a post-industrial, knowledge-based <b>paradigm</b> <b>in</b> which mental skills and education were more important to advancement than manual skills.|$|E

25|$|An {{algorithm}} may {{be viewed}} as controlled logical deduction. This notion may be expressed as: Algorithm = logic + control. The logic component expresses the axioms that may be used in the computation and the control component determines the way in which deduction is applied to the axioms. This is the basis for the logic programming <b>paradigm.</b> <b>In</b> pure logic programming languages the control component is fixed and algorithms are specified by supplying only the logic component. The appeal of this approach is the elegant semantics: a change in the axioms has a well-defined change in the algorithm.|$|E

This theory became the dominant <b>paradigm</b> <b>in</b> American linguistics from the 1960s through the 1980s, while linguistic relativity became the object of ridicule.|$|E
