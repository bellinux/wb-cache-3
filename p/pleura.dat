5|$|The lung is {{surrounded}} by a serous membrane of visceral <b>pleura,</b> which has an underlying layer of loose connective tissue attached to the substance of the lung.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen is {{the section}} behind the metathorax, {{made up of}} a series of rings, each with a hole for {{breathing}} and respiration, called a spiracle, composing three different segmented sclerites: the tergum, <b>pleura,</b> and the sternum. The tergum in almost all species is membranous, or usually soft and concealed by the wings and elytra when not in flight. The <b>pleura</b> are usually small or hidden in some species, with each pleuron having a single spiracle. The sternum is the most widely visible part of the abdomen, being a more or less sclerotized segment. The abdomen itself does not have any appendages, but some (for example, Mordellidae) have articulating sternal lobes.|$|E
5|$|Asbestos {{can cause}} a variety of lung diseases, {{including}} lung cancer. Tobacco smoking and asbestos have a synergistic effect on the formation of lung cancer. In smokers who work with asbestos, the risk of lung cancer is increased 45-fold compared to the general population. Asbestos can also cause cancer of the <b>pleura,</b> called mesothelioma (which is different from lung cancer).|$|E
50|$|The costal and {{cervical}} portions and {{the periphery}} of the diaphragmatic portion of the parietal <b>pleurae</b> are innervated by the intercostal nerves. The mediastinal and central portions of the diaphragmatic <b>pleurae</b> are innervated by the phrenic nerves. The visceral <b>pleurae</b> covering the lung itself receive their innervation from the autonomic nervous system and have no sensory innervation. Only the parietal <b>pleurae</b> are sensitive to pain.|$|R
50|$|Pleurisy is a {{condition}} of inflamed <b>pleurae.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Thorax has 8 {{segments}} and {{a slightly}} raised middle lobe between the outer <b>pleurae</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Bronchial {{injuries}} {{are divided into}} those that are accompanied by a disruption of the <b>pleura</b> {{and those that are}} not; in the former, air can leak from the hole in the airway and a pneumothorax can form. The latter type is associated with more minor signs; pneumothorax is small if it occurs at all, and although function is lost in the part of the lung supplied by the injured bronchus, unaffected parts of the lungs may be able to compensate.|$|E
5|$|The {{thoracic}} cavity is the space inside the chest {{that contains the}} lungs, heart, and numerous major blood vessels. On {{each side of the}} cavity, a pleural membrane covers the surface of lung (visceral <b>pleura)</b> and also lines the inside of the chest wall (parietal <b>pleura).</b> Normally, the two layers are separated by a small amount of lubricating serous fluid. The lungs are fully inflated within the cavity because the pressure inside the airways is higher than the pressure inside the pleural space. Despite the low pressure in the pleural space, air does not enter it because there are no natural connections to an air-containing passage, and the pressure of gases in the bloodstream is too low for them to be forced into the pleural space. Therefore, a pneumothorax can only develop if air is allowed to enter, through damage to the chest wall or damage to the lung itself, or occasionally because microorganisms in the pleural space produce gas.|$|E
5|$|Pleurodesis is a {{procedure}} that permanently eliminates the pleural space and attaches the lung to the chest wall. No long-term study (20 years or more) has been performed on its consequences. Good results {{in the short term}} are achieved with a thoracotomy (surgical opening of the chest) with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion (scraping of the <b>pleura)</b> of the inner layer. During the healing process, the lung adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the pleural space. Recurrence rates are approximately 1%. Post-thoracotomy pain is relatively common.|$|E
50|$|The lateral {{borders of}} the free cheeks (or librigenae) of bear {{indentations}} that fit {{the tips of the}} <b>pleurae</b> of the thorax and the first pair of pygidial <b>pleurae</b> and these could effectively lock the uncalcified underside of the animal during enrollment. This mechanism is comparable the situation in Pliomera. Remains of the alimentary tract containing coarse sediment, and of a multisegmented antenna have been found in Placoparia.|$|R
50|$|Each segment {{consists}} of the central axial ring and the outer <b>pleurae,</b> which protected the limbs and gills. The <b>pleurae</b> are sometimes abbreviated or extended to form long spines. Apodemes are bulbous projections on the ventral surface of the exoskeleton to which most leg muscles attached, although some leg muscles attached directly to the exoskeleton. Determining a junction between thorax and pygidium can be difficult and many segment counts suffer from this problem.|$|R

5|$|A small {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax will typically resolve without treatment and requires only monitoring. This approach {{may be most}} appropriate in {{people who have no}} underlying lung disease. In a larger pneumothorax, or if there is shortness of breath, the air may be removed with a syringe or a chest tube connected to a one-way valve system. Occasionally, surgery may be required if tube drainage is unsuccessful, or as a preventive measure, if there have been repeated episodes. The surgical treatments usually involve pleurodesis (in which the layers of <b>pleura</b> are induced to stick together) or pleurectomy (the surgical removal of pleural membranes). About 17–23 cases of pneumothorax occur per 100,000 people per year. They are more common in men than women.|$|E
5|$|Beetles are {{generally}} {{characterized by a}} particularly hard exoskeleton and hard forewings (elytra) not usable for flying. Almost all beetles have mandibulate mouthparts with the mandibles mobile in a horizontal plane. The mouthparts are rarely suctorial and are sometimes reduced and the maxillae always bear palps. The antennae usually have 11 or fewer segments except in some groups like the Rhipiceridae and Cerambycidae. The coxae of the legs are usually located recessed within a coxal cavity. The genitalic structures are telescoped into the last abdominal segment in all extant beetles. Unlike the adults, beetle larvae can often be confused with larvae of other endopterygote groups. The beetle's exoskeleton {{is made up of}} numerous plates, called sclerites, separated by thin sutures. This design provides armored defenses while maintaining flexibility. The general anatomy of a beetle is quite uniform, although specific organs and appendages vary greatly in appearance and function between the many families in the order. Like all insects, beetles' bodies are divided into three sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. Because there are so many species, identification is quite difficult, and relies on attributes including the shape of the antennae, the tarsal formulae and shapes of these small segments on the legs, the mouthparts, and the ventral plates (sterna, <b>pleura,</b> coxae). In many species accurate identification can only be made by examination of the unique male genitalic structures.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen is {{the largest}} tagma of the insect, which {{typically}} consists of 11–12 segments and is less strongly sclerotized than the head or thorax. Each segment of the abdomen is represented by a sclerotized tergum and sternum. Terga are separated {{from each other and}} from the adjacent sterna or <b>pleura</b> by membranes. Spiracles are located in the pleural area. Variation of this ground plan includes the fusion of terga or terga and sterna to form continuous dorsal or ventral shields or a conical tube. Some insects bear a sclerite in the pleural area called a laterotergite. Ventral sclerites are sometimes called laterosternites. During the embryonic stage of many insects and the postembryonic stage of primitive insects, 11 abdominal segments are present. In modern insects there is a tendency toward {{reduction in the number of}} the abdominal segments, but the primitive number of 11 is maintained during embryogenesis. Variation in abdominal segment number is considerable. If the Apterygota are considered to be indicative of the ground plan for pterygotes, confusion reigns: adult Protura have 12 segments, Collembola have 6. The orthopteran family Acrididae has 11 segments, and a fossil specimen of Zoraptera has a 10-segmented abdomen.|$|E
50|$|The {{articulate}} midpart of the exoskeleton (or thorax) {{consists of}} 19-21 segments. The axis {{is about as}} wide as each of the ribs (or <b>pleurae)</b> to its sides, not counting the spines at their tips, which gradually arch further back while slightly increasing in length, while the spines on the rear thoracic segment are much longer, about {{twice as long as}} the associated <b>pleurae,</b> are directly entirely backwards, and extend convincingly beyond the pygidium.|$|R
50|$|Pleurodesis is {{a medical}} {{procedure}} in which the pleural space is artificially obliterated. It involves the adhesion of the two <b>pleurae.</b>|$|R
50|$|Size: Up to 1.5 in (4 cm) long. It had up to 15 {{thoracic}} segments, with {{a narrow}} axis and wide <b>pleurae.</b>|$|R
5|$|The thorax is a tagma {{composed}} of three sections, the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax. The anterior segment, {{closest to the}} head, is the prothorax, with the major features being the first pair of legs and the pronotum. The middle segment is the mesothorax, with the major features being the second pair of legs and the anterior wings. The third and most posterior segment, abutting the abdomen, is the metathorax, which features the third pair of legs and the posterior wings. Each segment is dilineated by an intersegmental suture. Each segment has four basic regions. The dorsal surface is called the tergum (or notum) to distinguish it from the abdominal terga. The two lateral regions are called the <b>pleura</b> (singular: pleuron) and the ventral aspect is called the sternum. In turn, the notum of the prothorax is called the pronotum, the notum for the mesothorax is called the mesonotum and the notum for the metathorax is called the metanotum. Continuing with this logic, the mesopleura and metapleura, {{as well as the}} mesosternum and metasternum, are used.|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} metallic colour is green, but {{can vary}} by region, ranging from metallic green to purple. In the Flinders Ranges of South Australia and Alice Springs, the colour of the ants shifts from the typical green {{to a dark}} purple colour. In areas with more rainfall such as the New South Wales tablelands and Victorian savannahs, green-head ants are mostly green with purplish tints seen {{on the sides of}} the mesosoma. In the northern regions of New South Wales and Queensland, the alitrunk is reddish-violet, which shades into golden around the lower portions of the <b>pleura.</b> The green colour is either limited or completely absent in this case. Most populations have a bright green gaster, except for those living in the central desert. In some areas examined near Brisbane, two different colour forms were discovered within a single colony. One possibility is that the two colour forms may represent two sibling species, but this cannot be confirmed because of lack of evidence. In far north Queensland, populations appear to be dull green and distinct to those living in the south, but it is unknown how the ants in the far north and south hook up at the western and southern regions of the Atherton Tableland. With this said, it is unknown if the far north populations are actually a different species. In addition to colour variation, there are morphological differences among populations. For example, the size and shape of the head and petiole, the length of the appendages, and other sculptural details of the body may all vary.|$|E
5|$|While TBI may {{be managed}} without surgery, {{surgical}} repair of the tear is considered {{standard in the}} treatment of most TBI. It is required if a tear interferes with ventilation; if mediastinitis (inflammation of the tissues in the mid-chest) occurs; or if subcutaneous or mediastinal emphysema progresses rapidly; or if air leak or large pneumothorax is persistent despite chest tube placement. Other indications for surgery are a tear more than one third the circumference of the airway, tears with loss of tissue, and a need for positive pressure ventilation. Damaged tissue around a rupture (e.g. torn or scarred tissue) may be removed in order to obtain clean edges that can be surgically repaired. Debridement of damaged tissue can shorten the trachea by as much as 50%. Repair of extensive tears can include sewing a flap of tissue taken from the membranes surrounding the heart or lungs (the pericardium and <b>pleura,</b> respectively) over the sutures to protect them. When lung tissue is destroyed as a result of TBI complications, pneumonectomy or lobectomy (removal of a lung or of one lobe, respectively) may be required. Pneumonectomy is avoided whenever possible due to the high rate of death associated with the procedure. Surgery to repair a tear in the tracheobronchial tree can be successful even when it is performed months after the trauma, as can occur if the diagnosis of TBI is delayed. When airway stenosis results after delayed diagnosis, surgery is similar to that performed after early diagnosis: the stenotic section is removed and the cut airway is repaired.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{value of}} {{ultrasound}} techniques in {{examination of the}} <b>pleurae</b> and lungs has been underestimated over recent decades. One explanation {{for this is the}} assumption that the ventilated lungs and the bones of the rib cage constitute impermeable obstacles to ultrasound. However, a variety of pathologies of the chest wall, <b>pleurae</b> and lungs result in altered tissue composition, providing substantially increased access and visibility for ultrasound examination. It is a great benefit that the <b>pleurae</b> and lungs can be non-invasively imaged repeatedly without discomfort or radiation exposure for the patient. Ultrasound is thus particularly valuable in follow-up of disease, differential diagnosis and detection of complications. Diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in patients with pathologic pleural and pulmonary findings can tolerably be performed under real-time ultrasound guidance. In this article, an updated overview is given presenting not only the benefits and indications, but also the limitations of pleural and pulmonary ultrasound...|$|R

5000|$|Placoparia is a genus of trilobites {{of average}} size (up to 6 cm) that lived {{during the late}} Lower to the early Upper Ordovician on the paleocontinents Gondwana, Avalonia and Laurentia, now the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Morocco, Portugal, Spain and Wales. Its headshield (or cephalon) is {{semi-circular}} to rectangular with rounded frontal corners. It lacks eyes, but eye ridges are present. The fact that the facial sutures are [...] opisthoparian (with sutures in Pliomera gonatoparian) is an exception in the otherwise proparian Cheirurina. The thorax has 11 or 12 segments, with the axis slightly wider than the ribs (or <b>pleurae)</b> to its sides. The tips of the <b>pleurae</b> are free, which associates with an old-fashion radiatior of the central heating. The axis in the small tailshield (or pygidium) consists of four rings and a minute endpiece. The four <b>pleurae</b> end in spatulate spines that fit to corresponding indentations in the cephalon.|$|R
50|$|The visceral and parietal <b>pleurae</b> both {{derive from}} the lateral plate {{mesoderm}} which splits into two layers the somatopleuric mesoderm forming the parietal membrane and the splanchnopleuric mesoderm of the visceral membrane.|$|R
50|$|The cephalon has {{a rather}} narrow frontal area, and the {{anterior}} {{sections of the}} facial sutures run close to frontal lobe anteriorly. The large mosaic (schizochroal) eyes reach far backward. The main body (or thorax) is composed of eleven segments. The side lobes (<b>pleurae)</b> of the thorax curve stronger backward closer to the tail shield (or pygidium), their pointed tips longer than those of anterior <b>pleurae.</b> The pygidium is elongate subtriangular with the axis narrowly triangular reaching {{the back of the}} pygidium and consisting of about 10 rings. The pleural fields have 3 or 4 ribs.|$|R
25|$|The ventral view or sternum {{follows the}} same convention, with the {{prosternum}} under the prothorax, the mesosternum under the mesothorax and the metasternum under the metathorax. The notum, <b>pleura,</b> and sternum of each segment {{have a variety}} of different sclerites and sutures, varying greatly from order to order, and they will not be discussed in detail in this section.|$|E
25|$|Pulmonary {{pathology}} is a subspecialty of anatomic (and especially surgical) pathology {{that deals}} with diagnosis and characterization of neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases of the lungs and thoracic <b>pleura.</b> Diagnostic specimens are often obtained via bronchoscopic transbronchial biopsy, CT-guided percutaneous biopsy, or video-assisted thoracic surgery. These tests can be necessary to diagnose between infection, inflammation, or fibrotic conditions.|$|E
25|$|The diaphragmatic {{surface of}} the spleen (or phrenic surface) is convex, smooth, and is {{directed}} upward, backward, and to the left, except at its upper end, where it is directed slightly to the middle. The spleen lies beneath the left diaphragm, beneath the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs. The diaphragm separates the spleen from the <b>pleura</b> and base of the left lung.|$|E
50|$|Bathyuriscus is an extinct genus of Cambrian trilobite. It was a nektobenthic predatory carnivore. The genus Bathyuriscus is {{endemic to}} the shallow seas that {{surrounded}} Laurentia. Its major characteristics {{are a large}} forward-reaching glabella, pointed <b>pleurae</b> or <b>pleurae</b> with very short spines, and a medium pygidium with well-impressed furrows. Complete specimens have never reached the size of 7 cm predicted by the largest pygidium found. Bathyuriscus is often found with the free cheeks shed, indicating a moulted exoskeleton. An average specimen will in addition have a furrowed glabella, crescent-shaped eyes, be semi-circular in overall body shape, have 7 to 9 thoracic segments, and a length of about 1.5 inches.|$|R
50|$|Like all burlingiids, Burlingia {{is small}} (less than 1 cm long), has an overall ovate shape, proparian facial sutures, and raised {{anterior}} {{borders of the}} <b>pleurae.</b> Burlingia has between 10 and 15 thorax segments, while Schmalenseeia has between 7 and 9. It is however difficult to determine where the thorax meets the pygidium, particularly because uniquely, in Burlingia the <b>pleurae</b> of the pygidium are not fused. Burlingia differs further from most Schmalenseeia-species {{with the exception of}} S. acutangula in having a parallel-sided glabella that is abruptly rounded at front, and there is no ridge connecting the front of the glabella with the anterior border (the so-called plectrum).|$|R
50|$|They are {{at first}} {{situated}} between the <b>pleurae</b> and the Intercostales interni, and then between the Intercostales interni and innermost. They supply the intercostal muscles and, by branches which perforate the Intercostales externi, the Pectoral muscles and the mamma.|$|R
