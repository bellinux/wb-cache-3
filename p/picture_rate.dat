The video {{signal from the}} Nipkow disc scanner was amplified and connected to the cutting stylus of the turntable.

Unlike Baird's other experiments (including stereoscopy, colour and infra-red night-vision), {{there is no evidence of}} a public demonstration of playback of pictures. The results were considered a failure at the time, and Baird moved on leaving behind several discs in the hands of museums and favoured company members.|$|E
40|$|Occlusion {{detection}} is {{an essential}} ingredient in high quality <b>picture</b> <b>rate</b> up-conversion and view interpolation applications. Many integrated approaches to occlusion detection and classification have been proposed, particularly in the stereo literature. However, due to their high complexity and 1 -dimensional nature (baseline stereo), few of them are suitable for real-time use in <b>picture</b> <b>rate</b> up-conversion. This paper reviews fast, deterministic methods for occlusion detection and proposes a new method, suitable for real-time use in motion compensated <b>picture</b> <b>rate</b> up-conversion...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{continuous}} pressure {{to lower the}} implementation complexity and {{improve the quality of}} motion-compensated <b>picture</b> <b>rate</b> conversion methods. Since the concept of hierarchy can be advantageously applied to many motion estimation methods, we have extended and improved the current state-of-the-art motion estimation method in this field, 3 -Dimensional Recursive Search (3 DRS), with this concept. We have explored the extensive parameter space and present an analysis of the importance and influence of the various parameters for the application of <b>picture</b> <b>rate</b> conversion. Since wellperforming motion estimation methods for <b>picture</b> <b>rate</b> conversion show a trade-off between prediction accuracy and spatial motion field consistency, determining the optimal trade-off {{is an important part of}} the analysis.

But at bound-aries of moving objects, where either covering or uncover-ing of background occurs (occlusion areas), wrong values are likely in the motion vectors, and in the up-converted pic-tures.

40|$|The {{quality of}} the {{interpolated}} images in <b>picture</b> <b>rate</b> upconversion is predominantly dependent on {{the accuracy of the}} motion vector fields. Block based MEs typically yield incorrect vectors in occlusion areas, which leads to an annoying halo in the upconverted video sequences. In the past we have developed a cost-effective block based motion estimator, the 3 D Recursive Search ME, and an improved accuracy version for tackling occlusion, the tritemporal ME. In this article we describe how the vector field from this tritemporal ME is further improved by a retimer, using information from a foreground/background detector. More accurate motion vector fields are of importance to other applications also (e. g. video compression, 3 D, scene analysis [...] .) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new block-based motion {{estimation}} strategy, which aims at correctly finding {{the velocity of}} picture blocks, even for background blocks in occlusion areas. This tritemporal ME calculates the motion between two pictures, switching the ME reference plane dependent on an occlu. sion detector. also introduce a retimer, which can transform, locally in the picture, motion vectors valid for one time instant to another time instant. The retimer uses a foreground/background detector, of which we describe three varieties. Occlusion {{is a problem that}} plagues all block based motion estimation methods, and hence we see a utility of our method for applications like e. g. <b>picture</b> <b>rate</b> conversion, video compression, 3 D matching or image sequence object extraction.
