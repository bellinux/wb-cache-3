30|$|Since microparticles {{addition}} dampens {{the natural}} convection considerably, convection dominated melting becomes slow. However, {{there is significant}} difference between nanoparticles composites and microparticles composites as shown in Fig.  8 b. First notable difference lies {{in the form of}} heat transfer enhancement period. Overall, microparticles of any fraction enhance the heat transfer rate for shorter period in comparison with its nano-counterpart. However, the gap narrows down with increase in <b>particle</b> <b>fraction.</b> Due to higher thermal conductivity, microparticles PCMs are supposed to exhibit higher heat transfer rate for longer period as compared to nanoparticles PCMs. However, due to particle migration in the liquid PCM, <b>particle</b> <b>fraction</b> adjacent to heat transfer surface becomes less and keeps reducing as time progresses. Hence, effective thermal conductivity may not be considerably high so that the reduction in heat transfer owing to dampened natural convection could be compensated. As seen earlier, particle migration is not significant when <b>particle</b> <b>fraction</b> is higher and thus, higher <b>particle</b> <b>fraction</b> composites could exhibit higher heat transfer rate for longer period. Because of same reason, during enhanced heat transfer period, there is not much difference between the heat transfer rates of nano and microcomposites of lower particle fractions. The difference widens as the <b>particle</b> <b>fraction</b> increases. Nevertheless, relatively higher heat transfer rates are observed with microparticles PCMs of any fraction in comparison with nanoparticles composites of same volume fraction.|$|E

30|$|Although the {{above-mentioned}} trend is observed for all values of particle fractions, the variation along the radius becomes less as the <b>particle</b> <b>fraction</b> increases.

The observed particle migration in this work is consistent with the results of Phillips et al. [18]. As the melting progresses, natural convection becomes stronger and hence, the particle migration would be on increasing mode. As a result, steeper particle concentration profiles are observed at later stages of melting.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The present {{composite}} structure models assume that reinforcement particles {{are located in}} a repeated arrayed order through metal matrix. This study investigates the effect of both random particle distribution and <b>particle</b> volume <b>fraction</b> on the indentation behavior of Al 1080 /SiC particle reinforced metalmatrix composites under a spherical indenter. The ceramic particles were distributed randomly in a certain <b>particle</b> volume <b>fraction</b> through aluminum matrix {{in order to achieve}} a similar structure to a real particulate {{composite structure}} as possible. The <b>particle</b> volume <b>fraction</b> strongly affects permanent indentation surface profiles and indentation depths. The indentation profile becomes smoother, and the peak indentation depth increases as the <b>particle</b> volume <b>fraction</b> decreases. The random particle distribution has a small effect on the peak indentation depth but affects strongly the permanent indentation profiles as well as the residual stress and strain fields in the indentation region. A small increase appears in the local particle concentration in the indentation region and is affected considerably by the random particle distribution.

30|$|As it is {{discussed}} in the later part of this section, the composite PCMs suffer from uneven distribution of particles due to particle migration from one region to other regions. The non-uniform distribution of particles calls for definition of thermal properties as functions of the variable, i.e. <b>particle</b> <b>fraction.</b> However, the CFD code used in this work permits only definition of thermal conductivity as a variable and the specific heat and latent heat values are to be defined as constants. This limitation results in some difference between numerical and experimental results. Since the particle migration {{is found to be}} prevailing only during melting process, the definition of constant specific heat and latent heat could not affect the solidification results. Similarly, the effect of particle migration is stronger in composites of lower <b>particle</b> <b>fraction</b> and thus, the deviation of numerical results from experimental measurements is more pronounced in case of composites with 0.1 <b>particle</b> <b>fraction.</b> In general, the deviation increases as the time progresses due to stronger particle migration at later stages of melting.|$|E

40|$|Subject of {{this project}} was to {{determine}} new emission factors and the actual emission load of particulate matter from combustion appliances for solid and liquid fuels used by households and the small consumer sector in Germany. A difference for the emissions of particles was made between the total quantity of emitted particles and the <b>particle</b> <b>fractions</b> PM_ 1, PM_ 2 _,_ 5, and PM_ 1 _ 0. For the investigation, particle measurements were taken at commercial stoves, boilers and applicances on the test rig and at installed appliances of the small consumer sector. As a supplement, previously carried-out in-house investigations were utilised and data from literature evaluated. Additionally the emission behaviour and the emissions of particulate matter from boilers with oil burners were investigated on the test rig {{for the use of}} light fuel oils with differing sulphur contents and applying a ferrocene-containing additive. In the investigations, both the filterable and the condensable <b>particle</b> <b>fractions</b> of the emissions were ascertained for the substances concerned. It was the case for instance with combustion appliances for solid fuels when the exhausts contained higher concentrations of organic compounds. In the same way, the measurements at the oil-fired appliances besides the filtrable particles comprised the condensable emission fraction in the form of sulphuric acid. The emission load of particles in the year 2000 for the household and small consumer section is substantially determined by the combustion of solid fuels in combustion appliances within the scope of the 1 "s"t BImSchV (Ordinance on Small Furnaces). About 94 % of the calculated particle matter load originate from these firing systems. In the case of oil burners, the <b>particle</b> <b>fractions</b> PM_ 1 and PM_ 1 _ 0 amount to between 88 and 100 % of the total particulate matter emission. For solid fuels, the <b>particle</b> <b>fractions</b> PM_ 1 and PM_ 1 _ 0 range between 64 and 99 %. In the case of stoves the amount of the <b>particle</b> <b>fractions</b> depend on the utilised fuel above all and only little on the combustion conditions and the appliance construction. The percentrages of the <b>particle</b> <b>fractions</b> for oil-fired appliances depend on the sulphur content of the fuel and hence the sulphuric acid concentration in the exhaust gas, which also has a substantial impact on the total particule emission level. In the case of manually and mechanically charged wood-fired boilers not only the fuel but also the heat output and the exhaust gas cleaning installations (e. g. fabric filter) affect the particle distribution. By installing a fabric filter in a modern underfeed firing system operating with waste wood a particle reduction of more than 90 % could be achieved. The reduction of the sulphur content to 0. 1 % by mass in light fuel oil results in a reduced emission of particles in the order of magnitude of 30 % through lower sulphuric acid concentrations in the exhaust gas.

For samples with volumetric percentages of fragments more than 20 % (coral <b>particle</b> <b>fraction</b> of 31 %), the shear strength obtained from the CU-bar tests was significantly overestimated because of the unrealistically large negative excess pore pressure in the field corresponding to significant dilation.

30|$|Unlike solidification, {{the flow}} of liquid PCM cannot be ignored during melting due to the {{existence}} of natural convection. Hence, to examine the particle distribution at various times during melting, the concentration profiles are plotted along the radial direction (Fig.  7 d–f). Since composites of various <b>particle</b> <b>fractions</b> melt at different rates, in view of comparison, the presented profiles are the one those correspond to melt fractions 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75.|$|R
40|$|Purpose The role of fine lactose in the {{dispersion}} of salmeterol xinafoate (SX) from lactose mixtures was studied by modifying the fine lactose concentration {{on the surface}} of the lactose carriers using wet decantation. Methods Fine lactose was removed from lactose carriers by wet decantation using ethanol saturated with lactose. Particle sizing was achieved by laser diffraction. Fine <b>particle</b> <b>fractions</b> (FPFs) were determined by Twin Stage Impinger using a 2. 5...|$|R
