40|$|The {{concept of}} {{inclusive}} innovation and inclusive development {{has become a}} widely used concept recently in international organisations such as the World Bank and United Nations. These concepts also increasingly appear in documents produced by <b>donor</b> <b>organisations</b> such as IDRC (Canada), Sida (Sweden), Danida (Denmark) and Norida (Norway). In this Thematic Report we discuss the conceps. But the major purpose is to spell out some basic principles for public policy and development strategies {{on the one hand}} and <b>donor</b> <b>organisations</b> and international advisory bodies on the other hand...|$|R

40|$|The Millennium Development Goals {{have placed}} poverty {{reduction}} {{at the top}} of donor organisations' list of priorities. Failure to achieve the MDGs will no doubt place the spotlight on their financial commitments to poverty reduction, but effective poverty reduction relies as much on knowledge of poverty and poverty reduction and the kinds of knowledge that emerge from, and inform, the activities of <b>donor</b> <b>organisations.</b> The paper considers this issue in the context of Indonesia. It examines the main parameters of knowledge generation for poverty reduction in the country office of a <b>donor</b> <b>organisation.</b> It finds that organisational, environmental, intellectual and experiential factors have significance in this context...|$|R

40|$|New {{forms of}} aid, {{including}} “philanthrocapitalism” such as The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, are rapidly altering the international aid architecture for health. These organisations have financial power, actively shape agendas and influence policy. The rise of non-traditional <b>donor</b> <b>organisations</b> creates opportunities and {{has implications for}} Australia as it scales-up its aid program. AusAID could collaborate, complement, compete with, or copy these organisations. Arguably the biggest strategic implication is that they expand AusAID’s programming choices. This increased flexibility {{could be used to}} leverage and accelerate further reforms in the UN and elsewhere. But choice is a two way street. Developing countries may prefer large, grant financing from non-traditional aid organisations and choose to bypass traditional multilateral and bilateral development agencies.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{international}} development assistance was often marked by overlaps, {{duplication of efforts}} and rivalry between multitudes of <b>donor</b> <b>organisations.</b> In order to translate {{the principles of the}} Paris Declaration into practice in the field of Local Governance and Decentralisation (LGD), different <b>donor</b> <b>organisations</b> have joined forces on headquarter level and formed a working group, the Development Partners Working Group for Local Governance and Decentralisation (DPWG-LGD), which is operating since 2006. InWEnt is hosting the secretariat of the group since 2008 and assigned Wageningen International to organise two lead donor workshops. The workshop drew a cross section of delegates who comprised development partners, consultants, academicians, members of parliament and local governance practitioners.

40|$|Donor {{funds are}} {{available}} for treatment of many diseases such as HIV. However, privacy constraints {{make it hard for}} <b>donor</b> <b>organisations</b> to verify that they have not sponsored the same patient twice — or sponsored a patient whose treatment was also sponsored by another donor. This paper presents a protocol based on digital cash that enables <b>donor</b> <b>organisations</b> to obtain a proof (in the form of an e-coin) from healthcare providers for patients such a provider claims to have treated. These coins are distributed to patients {{at the beginning of a}} funding cycle. The major challenge is to issue a unique coin to a patient — even if the coin is reissued. This is achieved without giving anyone access to a national database of identities; all databases contain effectively concealed information. Reissued coins will be identical to previous coins with a probability that can be decided beforehand...|$|R

40|$|Worldwide Community-based Tourism (CBT) {{projects}} became in {{the past}} years extremely popular among the international <b>donor</b> <b>organisations.</b> Quite often tourism projects like ecolodges have been implemented in cooperation with local communities without giving the people a clear picture about the threats and problems which can arise by running a tourism project in their village. Furthermore the participants of such a project, often farmers or fishers with poor education and without experiences of being a tourist abroad, have not been sufficient trained in workshops on issues like administration, marketing, service, language skills and interpretation. Additionally the <b>donor</b> <b>organisations</b> quite often support these projects financially without carrying out a market analysis on the regional, national and international level. But another important aspect {{is the lack of}} creativity. Most of these CBT-Projects just construct an ecolodge that has the same design and architecture like lodges in their area; or they just copy the tour program of other organisations without keeping in mind that eac...|$|R

50|$|Outcome mapping is {{a project}} {{progress}} measurement system that was designed by the grant-making organisation International Development Research Centre (IDRC).

50|$|Burma's {{government}} {{spends the}} least percentage of its GDP {{on health care}} of {{any country in the}} world, and international <b>donor</b> <b>organisations</b> give less to Burma, per capita, than any other country except India. Unsafe medical practices, like the reuse of unsterilised equipment, as well as insufficient blood screening, has also been a source of infection. Also, the relative lack of accessible health care in conflict areas along the Burmese border make it difficult for AIDS patients to seek medical help. Interruptions in supply and delivery of ART lead to drug resistance and could lead to new strains of HIV.|$|R

Finally, community-based approaches have served to shift the focus away from wider - often more politically sensitive - factors impacting vulnerability, which supersede community-level control and responsibility.
