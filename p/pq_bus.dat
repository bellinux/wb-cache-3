Generally, in a <b>PQ</b> <b>bus,</b> the generated real and reactive power will be assumed to be zero. However, power will be flowing out, thus, {{the real power}} and reactive power will be both negative. The Load Bus will be used to find the bus voltage and angle.|$|E

The SG excitation regulations include the constant power factor regulation and the automatic voltage regulation (AVR), which are modeled as <b>PQ</b> <b>bus</b> and PV bus respectively. The PV-PQ bus type switching strategy [24] should be implemented if the reactive power injection of PV bus violates the limits.|$|E

The {{difference}} between schedule power flow and online power flow {{is that the}} former has no corresponding physical power flow, while the latter is the reappearance of existing physical power flow. Owing to the different premise, the selection of power flow calculation’s known quantities can be different. A schedule power flow schedules physical power flow for power system, so the selection of known quantities has strict requirements, such as active power and reactive power regulation capability. Since the physical power flow exists, the selection of online power flow calculation’s known quantities can be more flexible. For example, we can choose load bus as slack bus or replace <b>PQ</b> <b>bus</b> with PV bus. The example demonstrated that we could locate the stealing electricity buses by choosing load bus as slack bus. Considering that voltage amplitude measurement accuracy is higher than reactive power measurement accuracy, we can replace <b>PQ</b> <b>bus</b> with PV bus and make the power flow calculation results more consistent with the physical power flow. Finally, the examples show that online power flow calculation’s known quantities can be selected flexibly according to the actual situation rather than strictly following the classical power flow calculation requirements...|$|E
30|$|For many decades, {{energy was}} {{produced}} in bulk by large power stations, and then carried through transmission lines to passive distribution systems. Highly efficient models of traditional power systems in both normal [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and faulted conditions [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] have been developed. However, {{in the last two}} decades, power systems have faced a shift from traditional to current systems in which, besides the bulk production, energy is produced by smaller energy resources connected to distribution systems. At first, distributed energy resources (DERs) were based on the same technology as traditional AC, synchronous and induction, machines for bulk production, but with much smaller size. Therefore, modeling of these systems, at that time, was not a serious challenge, as models for traditional AC machines have been well developed, standardized and widely used in power industry for decades [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. In the normal operational state, these machines can be set to inject constant real and reactive power or to inject constant real power and to keep constant voltage magnitude. Therefore, they have been modeled with single-phase <b>PQ</b> and PV <b>bus</b> types [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In the faulted system conditions, traditional AC machines completely lose their control, and the response of which depends on their physical characteristics. The fault currents of the machines can be as high as 30 times the rated currents. And they have been modeled as voltage sources behind sub-transient, transient, or steady state impedances [6, 7, 8].|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} vector-controlled {{distributed}} generator (DG) {{model for a}} power flow based on a three-phase current injection method (TCIM). In order to represent the DG models in the power flow, steady-state phase current output equations are formulated. Using these equations, the TCIM power flow formulation is modified to include the DG models. In the proposed power flow, a DG-connected bus is modeled as either a load bus (<b>PQ</b> <b>bus)</b> or a voltage-controlled bus (PV bus), depending on the control mode of the reactive power. However, unlike conventional bus models, {{the values of the}} DG-connected bus models are represented by three-phase quantities: three-phase active and reactive power output for a <b>PQ</b> <b>bus,</b> and three-phase active power and positive-sequence voltage for a PV bus. In addition, a method is proposed for representing the reactive power limit of a voltage-control-mode DG by using the q-axis current limit. Utilizing a modified IEEE 13 -bus test system, the accuracy of the proposed method is verified by comparison to the power systems computer aided design (PSCAD) model. Furthermore, the effect of the number of DGs on the convergence rate is analyzed, using the IEEE 123 -bus test system...|$|E

Due to the priority scheduling for wind power, the wind farm connects {{to a system}} as a negative load and is treated as <b>PQ</b> <b>bus</b> in power flow calculation. With the minimum power generation cost objective function, power balance equations and system safe operation constraints, OPF can make the priority scheduling of renewable power generation resources and the lowest levels for energy consumption goal come true (Appendix C and Appendix D) [28].|$|E
30|$|PΣQΣ: {{traditional}} three-phase AC machines {{as well as}} IBDERs and DFIMs can {{be represented}} with this bus type. In accordance with [89], the control strategy of the DER connected to this bus type consists of specifying the injected three-phase real and reactive powers control. Due to the unsymmetrical system state, the real and reactive powers at the PCC of DER are not equally distributed per phase. Therefore, representing this control strategy with the traditional single-phase <b>PQ</b> <b>bus</b> type, per each phase, would introduce calculation errors. The shortcoming could be omitted by using the PΣQΣ bus type. For the three-phase real and reactive powers are known variables, while the three sequence components of phase voltages are unknown state variables.|$|E
30|$|Reference [102] {{introduces}} the second variant of three-phase slack bus— 3 θV, and the three-phase load bus— 3 PQ. They {{are shown in}} Table  3. These buses are derived from traditional single-phase buses—θV (single-phase slack bus) and PQ. The 3 θV bus type is used in a case when a weak distribution grid {{is connected to the}} strong (sub)transmission grid with specified unsymmetrical voltages (infinite three-phase bus). The 3 <b>PQ</b> <b>bus</b> type is a three-phase bus, where three (unbalanced) single-phase traditional load buses, as described in Section  2.1, are connected to the distribution grid. The electronically coupled loads, including prosumers and DG-ES, are considered by the other bus types listed in Table  3, depending on the implemented control strategy.|$|E
40|$|Development of Distributed generations (DGs) {{has changed}} the nature of power {{networks}} from passive to active. In order to specify a proper model for DG units, function and connection style of DGs to the network (direct or indirect) must be clarified. In this paper, operation of DGs in an unbalanced condition (due to unbalanced loads) will be studied. A three-phase power flow model is used to confirm the certainty of the proposed model. Generally DG modelling, depend on its type and controlling circuit, is like either PV or <b>PQ</b> <b>bus.</b> In this paper a three-phase unbalanced power flow model using Newton-Raphson method over a 4 buses power system is implemented. Based on the type of bus (PV or PQ), Simulation results show that the DGs can improve voltage profile (NEME and IEEE unbalance factor) and reduce network losses...|$|E
30|$|In {{comparison}} with PDNSE, the major issue for active distribution network state estimation (ADNSE) {{lies in the}} modeling of DGs. A single-phase SE for distributed networks integrated with DGs was performed in [14]. In [15], the DG units were modeled as <b>PQ</b> <b>bus</b> injection, without any detailed models of DGs. In [16], sequence-based models for different types of DGs were proposed. Pseudo- measurements for the DG three-phase total outputs, obtained from historical database or weather forecast, were set for unmonitored DGs in [16, 17]. Moreover, the phase outputs of DGs were determined with phase-based averaging. However, this phase-based averaging approach degrades the SE accuracy because the phase outputs of DGs largely depend on the unbalanced operating conditions [18, 19]. It is often assumed that the three-phase output powers of DGs are balanced. However, that {{is not always the}} case in light of the unbalanced interfacing conditions. To conclude, the asymmetric characteristics of distribution networks or DG three-phase outputs have not been well considered.|$|E
40|$|Ahsrracr-This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} static stability in electric power systems. The study {{is based on a}} model consisting of the classical swing equation characterization for generators and constant admittance, PV bus and/or <b>PQ</b> <b>bus</b> load representations which, in general, leads to a semi-explicit (or constrained) system of differential equations. A precise definition of static stability is given and basic concepts of static bifurcation theory are used to show that this definition does include conventional notions of steady-state stability and voltage collapse, but it provides a basis for rigorous analysis. Static bifurcations of the load flow equations are analyzed using the Liapunov-Schmidt reduction and Taylor series expansion of the resulting reduced bifurcation equation. These procedures have been implemented using symbolic computation (in MASYMA). It is shown that static bifurcations of the load flow equations are associated with either divergence-type instability or loss of causality. Causality issues are found to be an important factor in understanding voltage collapse and {{play a central role in}} organizing global power system dynamics when loads other than constant admittance are present.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an enhanced genetic algorithm (EGA) for {{the solution of}} the optimal power flow (OPF) with both continuous and discrete control variables. The continuous control variables modeled are unit active power outputs and generator-bus voltage magnitudes, while the discrete ones are transformer-tap settings and switchable shunt devices. A number of functional operating constraints, such as branch flow limits, load bus voltage magnitude limits, and generator reactive capa-bilities, are included as penalties in the GA fitness function (FF). Advanced and problem-specific operators are introduced in order to enhance the algorithm’s efficiency and accuracy. Numerical results on two test systems are presented and compared with results of other approaches. Index Terms—Genetic algorithms (GAs), optimal power flow (OPF).

30|$|The optimal {{sitting and}} sizing of DERs {{are two major}} {{concerns}} when planning DERs for voltage stability of distribution networks. In [9], the most sensitive bus to voltage collapse {{was selected as the}} priority location to place the DER for the voltage stability and power transfer capacity improvement. Then, the group of candidate buses were further analyzed by modal analysis in critical situations to decide the final installation locations of the DERs [10]. In [11], the load variations and voltage stability margin enhancements were considered to study their correlations with DER optimal planning in distribution networks, with an improved imperialistic competitive algorithm to solve the proposed model under each loading level. These papers have studied the reactive power support ability of a specific DER type, with no considerations of various DER types and their distinct reactive power contributions to distribution network operations. The existing classifications of DER types are demonstrated in [12, 13, 14]. Based on the generation technology, they are classified into photovoltaic, wind-turbine, fuel cell, micro-gas turbine, distributed small hydropower, etc. Based on the grid interface technology, they are classified into asynchronous interface, synchronous interface and power electronic interfaces. Based on the adopted bus types in a power flow calculation, they are classified into PV bus, <b>PQ</b> <b>bus,</b> PI bus and PQ(V) bus. However, for voltage stability in a distribution network, classifications based on the reactive power characteristics (RPC) of each DER type should be considered.|$|E
40|$|The high {{penetration}} {{level of}} Distributed Generation (DG) {{is one of}} the most attractive features of the smart grid aside from being automatic, modern, reliable and efficient. However, high penetration comes with more challenges to deal with such as the voltage and reactive power (Volt/Var) control and increased power loss. To address the issues in incorporating DGs in the power distribution system, this thesis provides a closer look at the Volt/Var control and power loss concerns caused by the random behavior of DGs. Modifying conventional control techniques by moving to a smart technique is a core requirement to mitigate these issues. Voltage control is hard if it is solely handled by on load tap changer (OLTC) transformer and switched shunt capacitors (SC) due to the high penetration and unpredictable behaviors of DGs. The ability to inject the reactive power of the DGs with the proper coordination of SC and OLTC can contribute to control Volt/Var besides minimizing the power loss. Centralized or distributed control of the Volt/Var control device integrated with heuristic based control scheme can be a promising solution to this problem. The distributed control scheme based on the automated agent technology is the first solution to the Volt/Var control problem presented in this thesis.. This is also known as the multi‐agent based system. Each device, i. e. OLTC, DG unit, SC and loads have their own intelligent agents which are capable of optimizing their operations via local measurements and communications with other control agents. Assuming the existence of proper communication medium and protocols, each agent without the knowledge of the whole system, can contribute to control Volt/Var. While doing so, none of the agents are going to violate their own requirements while attaining the global objective of Volt/Var control and reducing total system loss. The proposed control scheme for Volt/Var control is tested and simulated using the 8 bus distribution system in Matlab/Simulink. Fuzzy logic controller for each agent is used based on predefined rules. It was found that the voltage profile is improved after coordinating all the control devices with DGs. The number of tap operations for OLTC is also reduced after the coordination resulting to its increased lifetime. In the second part of this thesis centralized genetic algorithm based control mechanism is introduced in the system. In this section OLTC and SC are treated as controllers and DGs are treated as <b>PQ</b> <b>bus.</b> To get optimum voltage and realize reactive power control, the second part shows 24 hours lead time coordination among the OLTC, SC and DGs. This coordination takes place utilizing genetic algorithm. The optimal number of switching during the 24 -hour period for both SCs and OLTCs is determined with the goal to control reactive power flow or minimize the power loss, and above all to keep the voltage profiles within acceptable levels. The functionality of the proposed technique is tested through the simulation of a 30 -bus system in Matlab. Findings from the simulation results showed that the DG operation no longer imposes a significant effect on the voltage fluctuations and power loss profile in the distribution system if the OLTC and SC are switched based on a 24 -hour forecasted data of the DGs. The adaptive control technique which updates switching time and number every 6 hours of the day gives a better loss profile since the forecasted data becomes more accurate with time. This approach is simple, straightforward and efficient...|$|E
