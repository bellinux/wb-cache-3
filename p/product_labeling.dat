25|$|In the United States, {{where food}} <b>product</b> <b>labeling</b> {{requires}} language {{approval by the}} FDA, probiotic manufacturers have received warning letters of impending legal actions for using exaggerated claims of health benefits not supported by clinical evidence of efficacy. The Federal Trade Commission has taken punitive actions, including a US$21 million fine coordinated across 39 state governments against a major probiotic manufacturer, for deceptive advertising and exaggerated claims of health benefits for a yogurt and probiotic dairy drink.|$|E
25|$|The final {{government}} regulation towards increased demand is recycled <b>product</b> <b>labeling.</b> When producers {{are required to}} label their packaging with amount of recycled material in the product (including the packaging), consumers {{are better able to}} make educated choices. Consumers with sufficient buying power can then choose more environmentally conscious options, prompt producers {{to increase the amount of}} recycled material in their products, and indirectly increase demand. Standardized recycling labeling can also have a positive effect on supply of recyclates if the labeling includes information on how and where the product can be recycled.|$|E

25|$|Lactose {{is also a}} {{commercial}} food additive used for its texture, flavor, and adhesive qualities. It is found in additives labelled as casein, caseinate, whey, lactoserum, milk solids, modified milk ingredients, etc. As such lactose is found in foods such as processed meats (sausages/hot dogs, sliced meats, pâtés), gravy stock powder, margarines, sliced breads, breakfast cereals, potato chips, processed foods, medications, prepared meals, meal replacements (powders and bars), protein supplements (powders and bars), and even beers in the milk stout style. Some barbecue sauces and liquid cheeses used in fast-food restaurants may also contain lactose. Lactose is often used as the primary filler (main ingredient) in most prescription and non-prescription solid pill form medications, though <b>product</b> <b>labeling</b> seldom mentions the presence of 'lactose' or 'milk', and neither do product monograms provided to pharmacists, and most pharmacists are unaware of the very wide scale yet common use of lactose in such medications until they contact the supplier or manufacturer for verification.|$|E
500|$|Other {{consumer}} advocacy groups, {{notably the}} National Consumers League, expressed dismay at the popular reaction against the product, {{and especially the}} plant closures [...] "because of business the company has lost to very serious misinformation, widely disseminated by the media, about its product, lean finely textured beef (LFTB)". Similarly, the Consumer Federation of America said the plant closures were [...] "unfortunate" [...] and {{expressed concern that the}} product might be replaced in ground beef with [...] "something that has not been processed to assure the same level of safety". U.S. consumers have expressed concerns that ground beef which contains the product is not labeled as such, and that consumers are currently unable to make informed purchasing decisions due to this lack of <b>product</b> <b>labeling.</b> Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey called upon the USDA to institute mandatory labeling guidelines for ground beef sold in supermarkets, so consumers can make informed purchasing decisions.|$|E

2500|$|Following a {{shortage}} that led {{a court to}} delay an execution in California, a company spokesman for Hospira, the sole American manufacturer of the drug, objected {{to the use of}} thiopental in lethal injection.

2500|$|On February 12, 2007, {{after an}} {{advisory}} committee discussion and vote in December 2006, the FDA announced a revision to the labeling of Ketek. The changes included the removal {{of two of the}} three previously approved indications: acute bacterial sinusitis and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. The agency determined that the balance of benefits and risks no longer supported approval of the drug for these indications. Ketek remained on the market for the treatment of community acquired bacterial pneumonia of mild to moderate severity (acquired outside of hospitals or long-term care facilities). In addition, the FDA worked with the manufacturer to update the <b>product</b> <b>labeling</b> with a [...] "black box warning," [...] their strongest form of warning. Ketek's warning states that it should not be used in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease that causes muscle weakness.
