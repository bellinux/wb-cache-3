50|$|By {{the time}} Reauthorization passed, after 23 {{short-term}} extensions, the Parties were already {{two years into}} a new three-year contract negotiated in 2009. The new law provides for mediation and binding interest arbitration in the event the parties do not reach agreement in future contract negotiations, ensuring that there are never <b>unilaterally</b> <b>imposed</b> terms and conditions of employment ever again.|$|R

Two hundred photographers and writers from Mojo and Bauer's other music magazines, Kerrang! and Q, were reported as refusing to work under the new terms.|$|R

[...] Anthony Brown, a practice squad player for the Washington Redskins during the strike, challenged the teams' decision to <b>unilaterally</b> <b>impose</b> a $1,000 weekly maximum for practice players. This time, the NFL won, as the justices ruled 8-1 that groups of employers, as well as single employers, could implement a contract provision they had offered in good faith during an impasse.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the beginning of}} a study on the management of Jerusalem entry permits by foreign consulates during the post Intifada period (2004 - 2013). Since they are regularly welcoming into their offices Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza, foreign consulates do apply recurrently for Jerusalem entry permits to the Israeli COGAT. Through this analysis, I wish to assess the role of these foreign institutions in maintaining the borders <b>unilaterally</b> <b>imposed</b> by Israel around the city...|$|R

5000|$|A dispute {{emerged in}} 1998 when Nicaragua forbade the transit of Costa Rican policemen in the river, which Nicaragua {{claims to be}} a breach of sovereignty, and <b>unilaterally</b> <b>imposed</b> a [...] tax for any Costa Rican {{tourists}} who enter the San Juan river, as persons are not objects of trade but subjects of trade and are, therefore, not covered by the treaty. This and other subjects were the subjects of a case in the International Court of Justice.|$|R

40|$|Baseball {{remains the}} only {{professional}} sport exempt from anti-trust scrutiny. Because of this unique status, baseball players have not pursued anti-trust lines of attack. Some now say that baseball players {{no longer need to}} depend on the anti-trust laws to effectuate modifications in their reserve system. Such commentators say that because of the equal bargaining strength of the parties, the labor exemption would operate to shelter from scrutiny even a term that was <b>unilaterally</b> <b>imposed</b> by the owners. In Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore, Inc. v. National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, the Supreme Court held that the baseball industry was not amenable to anti-trust attack because it was purely an intrastate activity; Toolson v. New York Yankees, Inc. reaffirmed this holding. The Court failed to extend this exemption to other professional sports. The Court should overrule the exemption or alternatively, Congress should place the baseball industry in the same position as other professional sports with respect to anti-trust laws via legislative acts. Usage of the labor exemption to shelter <b>unilaterally</b> <b>imposed</b> terms, such as a reserve system, turns labor 2 ̆ 7 s shield into the employer 2 ̆ 7 s sword...|$|R

40|$|Debt Overhang is a {{controversial}} {{issue in the}} eurozone countries and is considered {{as one of the}} factors which created the current economic crisis. How to deal with sovereign debt has been debated both at the theoretical and policy making level. This paper looks at the Greek debt and four options are discussed: (a) unilateral default (b) <b>unilaterally</b> <b>imposed</b> austerity measures (c) restructuring through negotiating and (d) a tax on wealth to pay for the debt. Optimal options depend on the borrowing rate, debt maturity and debt haircut...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} two-country general {{equilibrium}} model of endogenous growth and trade between two regions, North and South, with different environmental standards. Pollution is a by-product of consumption {{and in order to}} abate it the northern region <b>unilaterally</b> <b>imposes</b> a green tax on consumption. As the tax affects domestic demand of consumer goods according to their pollution intensities, regardless of where those goods are produced, the model shows that such a unilateral environmental policy can increase the speed of technological change and pollution abatement in both regions. Trade, environment, consumption externality, technological change...|$|R
50|$|In 1990, the new {{constitution}} institutionalised ethnic Fijian domination of the political system. The Group Against Racial Discrimination (GARD) was formed to oppose the <b>unilaterally</b> <b>imposed</b> constitution and to restore the 1970 constitution. In 1992 Sitiveni Rabuka, the Lieutenant Colonel who had carried out the 1987 coup, became Prime Minister following elections held under the {{new constitution}}. Three years later, Rabuka established the Constitutional Review Commission, which in 1997 wrote a new constitution which was supported by most leaders of the indigenous Fijian and Indo-Fijian communities. Fiji was re-admitted to the Commonwealth of Nations.|$|R
50|$|On June 28, 2010, Alcon's Independent Director Committee {{announced}} that a recommendation by the Committee was an indispensable first step before {{the board of the}} company can decide on the merger proposal of Novartis AG, refuted Novartis’ public implications that it would be able to <b>unilaterally</b> <b>impose</b> the merger irrespective of the Independent Director Committee’s position once Novartis became Alcon’s majority shareholder. On July 8, 2010, Alcon's independent director committee (IDC) had set up a $50 million litigation trust to ensure company's minority shareholders get the best deal from bidder Novartis AG.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTrading in FX {{markets is}} {{dominated}} by two microstructures: exchanges with market makers and OTC-markets without market makers. Using laboratory experiments we test whether {{the impact of a}} Tobin tax is different in these two market microstructures. We find that (i) in markets without market makers an <b>unilaterally</b> <b>imposed</b> Tobin tax (i. e. a tax haven exists) increases volatility. (ii) In contrast, in markets with market makers we observe a decrease in volatility in unilaterally taxed markets. (iii) An encompassing Tobin tax has no impact on volatility in either setting.

40|$|This paper {{builds a}} Ricardian-Chamberlinian two-country model with {{heterogeneous}} firms in a monopolistically competitive sector {{in which every}} new entrant faces increasing fixed costs of production. There are efficiency gaps between countries in marginal and fixed costs and a country <b>unilaterally</b> <b>imposes</b> an import tariff. It is shown that an increase in tariff increases the number of firms of the tariff imposing country while decreases the number of firms of the tariff-imposed country, possibly reverting the position of net exporter of varieties. A tariff is detrimental to the tariff-imposed country. A small tariff may be beneficial to the tariff-imposing country. ...|$|R
5000|$|The Progressive Conservatives won a {{majority}} {{government in the}} 1995 election, and Snobelen was appointed as Minister of Education and Training in Mike Harris's government on June 26, 1995. Shortly after his appointment, Snobelen was filmed arguing that the PC government needs to [...] "bankrupt" [...] {{and to create a}} [...] "useful crisis" [...] in the education system so as to initiate significant reforms. This controversy provoked several calls for his resignation, and further unsettled the relationship {{between the government and the}} teaching community, which were already tense after the previous NDP administration <b>unilaterally</b> <b>imposed</b> a Social Contract.|$|R
5000|$|The {{treaty was}} {{violated}} when gold {{was discovered in}} Montana in 1874. However, the Sioux did not face intruders until Brevet Major General George Armstrong Custer and his army entered the Black Hills in 1874 and publicly announced their discovery of gold. By 1875 the announcement led {{to the establishment of}} large mining towns, such as Deadwood, Central City and Lead within the Black Hills. [...] Accordingly, the United States <b>unilaterally</b> <b>imposed</b> the Manypenny Agreement, claimed the land, and officially removed the Black Hills from the Sioux Reservation by passing the Congressional Act of February 28, 1877.

2500|$|In 1971 {{more and}} more dollars were being printed in Washington, then being pumped overseas, to pay for {{government}} expenditure on the military and social programs.

Unusually, this decision was made without consulting members of the international monetary system or even his own State Department, and was soon dubbed the Nixon Shock.|$|R
50|$|Critics of {{this system}} argue that {{it makes for a}} flawed democracy, as it does not {{necessarily}} elect the candidate who received the most votes. Another of its perceived disadvantages is {{that in the case of}} Chile, it consistently benefits one of the two political blocs, the Alianza, which consistently gets around 40% of votes and receives nearly 50% of the seats. Furthermore, it effectively excludes the smaller political forces that are not a part of either of the two big electoral alliances. Finally, it is considered greatly responsible for the fact that the Chilean Constitution, originally written and enforced by an authoritarian military dictatorship, has not been changed significantly even though it was <b>unilaterally</b> <b>imposed</b> by the regime.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{will argue}} that the round table model is the ideal {{constitution}} making process. This is primarily because it gives clarity to the respective powers of the institutions involved in the process, and may prevent a dominant group or individual from <b>unilaterally</b> <b>imposing</b> a constitution. In building my argument, I outline the theory of constituent power and its corollaries of unlimited constitution making power and popular participation. I endeavour to portray the shortcomings of the theory itself, and, the dangers of its practical manifestation. Following this, I introduce the round table model as a preferable alternative, both theoretically and practically. To buttress my argument, I examine the Bolivian, Venezuelan, Russian and South African constitution making episodes...|$|R
50|$|While {{forced labor}} is widely {{considered}} to be the most serious trafficking problem in Myanmar, authorities reported that most trafficking cases investigated and prosecuted involved women and girls subjected to forced marriage or intended to be subjected to forced marriage. The Myanmar regime rules arbitrarily through its <b>unilaterally</b> <b>imposed</b> laws, but rule of law is absent, as is an independent judiciary that would respect trafficking victims’ rights. The State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), Myanmar’s military government, has not acknowledged the prevalence of human rights issues within their country, specifically human trafficking. No one has been held accountable for the serious crimes committed by government security forces. These crimes include forced labor, child soldiers, and sexual violence.|$|R
50|$|On October 15, 2014, Life Partners Inc. <b>unilaterally</b> <b>imposes</b> New Fees on Investors without advance warning, dialog or recourse. As such investors {{received}} unexpected {{letters and}} bills {{for thousands of}} dollars. When phoned, customer service representatives explained that administering contracts was too expensive from them to continue without charging excessive new fees. They explained that monitoring contracts, having a web site, and manning the phones had not been built into their fees on the initial contracts (their business shortcoming or mistake) and that now investors had to pay these new fees in order for LPI to provide basic business services. They claim that this service was provided for free for the last so many years.|$|R

40|$|According to the {{principle}} nemini res sua servit iure servitutis, the owner is traditionally not allowed to <b>unilaterally</b> <b>impose</b> a servitude between own property. This impossibility {{has led to a}} harmful limitation to the pecuniary interests of the owner. Some legislations have introduced exceptions to that principle, thereby creating the “servitudes of the owner”. To allow the owners to constitute servitudes without meeting the requirement that dominant and servant lands must belong to different owners, doctrinaires have reinterpreted the current norm. Therefore, a rereading of the “apparent charge” of articles 881 and 938 of the Chilean and Colombian Civil Codes, respectively is done, which entails the formal destination of the owner, solving the problem through “destination made by the family father”...|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{forms of}} {{constitution}}-making {{in which a}} constitution is <b>unilaterally</b> <b>imposed</b> by a sovereign lawmaker, the constituent assembly creates a constitution through [...] "internally imposed" [...] actions, in {{that members of the}} constituent assembly are themselves citizens, but not necessary the rulers, of the country for which they are creating a constitution. [...] As described by Columbia University Social Sciences Professor Jon Elster:Constitutions arise {{in a number of different}} ways. At the non-democratic extreme of the spectrum, we may imagine a sovereign lawgiver laying down the constitution for all later generations. At the democratic extreme, we may imagine a constituent assembly elected by universal suffrage for the sole task of writing a new constitution. And there are all sorts of intermediate arrangements.|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, {{several of}} the city's {{contracts}} expired with their unionized staff: inside workers, outside workers, part-time parks and recreation staff, paramedics and library staff. The first union to settle was the outside workers, represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) Local 416. Negotiations with the outside workers went to the deadline and a deal was made averting a strike or lockout. One major change was the controversial [...] "jobs for life" [...] clause in the bargaining agreement which stated that all permanent employees with 10 years of service or more were guaranteed a job of equal pay for equal value if theirs was contracted out. CUPE accepted a change to 15 years of service under the same provision. During the 2012 bargaining sessions, Holyday threatened to <b>unilaterally</b> <b>impose</b> the city's offer.|$|R

Bibas published an Op-Ed in the EU Observer countering the fact-less decision. He notoriously challenged this decision citing that [...] "Not only is it an affront to the city of Modi’in. It is also an insulting and dangerous imposition on the sovereignty of the State of Israel, by seeking to <b>unilaterally</b> <b>impose</b> the limits of Israeli authority. Ours is a country which dreams of peace and will continue to strive for co-existence with our neighbours. Yet, the European Union’s decision, taken without real knowledge or understanding of our municipality and our region, is in danger of extending the boundaries of the conflict." ...|$|R
5000|$|On May 22, 1848, another elected {{assembly}} sat for {{the first}} time in Berlin. They were elected under the law of April 8, 1848, which allowed for universal suffrage and a two-stage voting system. Most of the deputies elected to the Berlin Assembly, called the Prussian National Assembly, were members of the burghers or liberal bureaucracy. They set about the task of writing a constitution [...] "by agreement with the Crown." [...] King Frederick William IV of Prussia <b>unilaterally</b> <b>imposed</b> a monarchist constitution to undercut the democratic forces. This constitution took effect on December 5, 1848. On December 5, 1848, the Berlin Assembly was dissolved and replaced with the bicameral legislature allowed under the monarchist Constitution. This legislature was composed of a Herrenhaus and a Landtag. Otto von Bismarck was elected to the first Landtag elected under the new monarchical constitution.|$|R
50|$|Although {{membership}} {{increased from}} 300 in 1915 to well over 1000 by 1920 {{this did not}} herald {{a new era of}} radicalism among the rank-and-file. Widespread unemployment heralded declines in attendance at Football League matches {{at a time when many}} clubs had, once again, committed themselves to expensive ground improvement programmes in the expectation that the post-war spectator boom would continue indefinitely. Inevitably, this caused financial difficulties at many clubs. Clubs believed their problems were due to players' excessive wages rather than over-expansion. In the spring of 1922, they persuaded the League authorities to arbitrarily impose a £1 cut to the maximum wage (£9 a week at that time) and force clubs to reduce the wages of players who were on less than the maximum. Legal proceedings backed by the Players' Union this time established that clubs could not <b>unilaterally</b> <b>impose</b> a cut in players' contracted wages.|$|R
