When the driver wishes to make a brake application, he operates the driver’s brake valve which releases some air from the train pipe, so operating the triple valves. When the driver wishes to release the brakes, his operation of the driver’s brake valve returns compressed air (stored in a cylinder near the driving position) into the train pipe and this moves the triple valve so as to release the air in the brake cylinders to atmosphere, allowing the brake blocks to move clear of the wheels. Although, in multiple-unit operation, the air reservoirs on the vehicles can be relatively quickly charged, the restoration of pressure to the train pipe takes some time as air has to travel physically {{down the length of the}} train.|$|E

40|$|This {{study focused}} on {{analysis}} of the new radiation shield design, verification and dose distribution calculations for three irradiation facilities: The analysis of the new radiation design concrete shield for the Citrusdal facility, and shield verification calculations (radiological safety assessment) for the already constructed Stellenbosch and HEPRO irradiation facilities. Additionally, as a subordinate objective, the study reports on dose distributions in the irradiated insect containers of the Citrusdal irradiation facility, and sample product boxes of the HEPRO irradiation facility. In 2006 a private company, Citrus Research International (CRI), began the engineering design of a new insect sterilization facility in Citrusdal in the Western Cape region of South Africa, which was then constructed from ordinary concrete density (3 ¸ 2. 35 g/cm) in the year 2007. This facility employs a very successful ionising radiation based method, the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), for drastically reducing or controlling insect population, which poses a serious pest problem in the Citrusdal agricultural area. The SIT uses the radionuclide 60 Co {{as the source of}} ionising radiation. The design-base activity of the 60 Co source for the Citrusdal facility was 740 TBq (20 kCi). Therefore, the new radiation shield design was done for this source strength. Analysis of the shield design has been carried-out using the integrated point-kernel (QAD-CGGP and the MathCAD worksheet) and confirmed with a Monte Carlo (MCNPX) radiation transport computer codes. This was done by considering the concrete shielding walls, the roof as well as the entrance/exit labyrinth at critical points for radiological protection purposes. However, only MCNPX was used to ascertain whether the labyrinth entrance/exit was radiologically safe because the point-kernel uses a semi-analytical, approximate methodology that is not able to account for radiation streaming through labyrinth. Satisfactory agreement was found between the three computational methods. Stellenbosch irradiation facility is being operated by the Agricultural Research Council as insect sterilization facility at Nietvoorbij, that is situated approximately 70 km from Cape Town. This facility uses a radiation based Sterile Insect technique; using 60 Co as the source of ionising radiation. The facility is designed chiefly for sterilization of fruit flies which presents a major problem in the agricultural area in South Africa. The facility was designed for a 5 kCi (0. 185 PBq) 60 Co source, but is now operated with a 10 kCi (0. 37 PBq) 60 Co source (reference source strength in the year 1999). The source activity was 3. 32 kCi (0. 12 PBq) in October 2007, i. e., shield verification calculations was performed for this activity. This was carried out using QAD-CGGP and verified with MCNPX radiation transport computer codes, and where possible, validated with measurements. Dose rates were measured with a calibrated gamma-ray monitor, GRAETZ X 5 C. The spatial distribution of dose rates around the shielding concrete walls, on top of the roof and in various positions along the maze were considered. The dose rates at the closest distance (at 10 cm) from the exterior of the concrete shielding walls were slightly higher. However, good agreement was found between measured and simulated (calculated) values. HEPRO is a commercial irradiation facility situated in Ferrule Avenue, Montagu Gardens, Milnerton, City of Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa. The HEPRO facility is mainly used for food irradiation and sterilization of medical instruments. This facility was originally designed to operate with a maximum '!Co source strength of 1 MCi (37 PBq). However, to increase the product throughput rate, the source strength had to be increased to a nominal 1. 5 MCi (55. 5 PBq) in 2005 / 6. Nevertheless a radiological safety assessment was performed for a source strength of 2 MCi (2 37 PBq 74 PBq) 60 Co, because any radiation safety system such as radiation shielding must have a “safety factor”. Again the point-kernel method was used for radiological safety assessment and verified with MCNPX radiation transport computer code. Observation of critical spots and where possible the spatial distribution of dose rates were measured using a calibrated gamma-ray monitor, GRAETZ X 5 C, to provide additional confirmation of results. The spatial distribution of dose rates around the shielding concrete along the walls, roof, cable penetration inside the hut on roof, inside irradiation vault, above water pool, hotspot on wall, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pipe</b> penetrations, sliding plug-door, and ducts of the hoistcable situated {{on the roof of the}} locked hut were considered. The comparison of dose rate values obtained using the aforementioned methods showed a slight deviation such that they were considered satisfactory. The use of Monte Carlo computational tools such as MCNPX in support of the prediction/assessment of the absorbed dose distributions in the irradiated product of the irradiation facilities can prove to be economically effective, representing savings in the utilization of dose meters, among other benefits. The absorbed dose distributions within the insect containers were calculated with the model developed in MCNPX for one hour of exposure. The modelling was carried out for a 60 Co source with a nominal activity of 16. 8 kCi, i. e., 622 TBq. The calculated values were compared to an average value from the preliminary experimental (sterility test) measurements. The sterility test for the insects, False Codling Moths, was done during the onset of the SIT programme at Citrusdal irradiation facility. The variability of the dose distribution inside the insect canisters were within acceptable dose values for adequate sterilising False Codling Moths. A systematic computational calculation methods was used to model/simulate the sample product undergoing irradiation in a 60 Co source for HEPRO industrial irradiator facility. This was carried-out using the Monte Carlo code—MCNPX. The calculation was done for a source-rack containing 4 25 100 60 Co pins, having a total activity of about 1 MCi (37 PBq). Four boxes were stacked around about 50 cm away from the source centerline. Each square box of sample product was rotated by 90 ° around the horizontal axis (perpendicular to the source rack), i. e., three times so that each of the four side of the box faced the source rack once during an irradiation session. A specific Fortran- 90 code uses an algorithm to calculate the absorbed dose distribution for equal-time irradiation was therefore applied. The Fortran- 90 code uses the dose values calculated by MCNPX and sums them in a suitable way in order to reproduce the mentioned rotations. The calculations revealed highest absorbed dose at the edges of the box, and even slightly higher at the four corners. The lowest absorbed dose was noticed at the centre of the sample product...|$|E

This paper {{presents the results of}} flow field, in terms of mean and root mean square (RMS) velocity of dust cloud in a silo during axial feeding using commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code,Fluent. The influence of grid size, modeling approach and discretization schemes were examined using turbulence model namely renormalization group k-ε (RNG) combined with disperse phase model (DPM) which follows Eulerian-Lagrangian (E-L) approach. The E-L approach treats solid particles as moving points in the computational domain and their movement is tracked as they moved through the gas flow. Two-way coupling effect was considered since the continuous phase flow field is impacted by the discrete phase. The profiles of mean and RMS velocity at five different axial locations Z = 750 mm, 1750 mm, 2750 mm, 3750 mm and 4750 mm were examined to recognized the flow pattern inside silo. Predicted mean and RMS velocity using combination of DPM and RNG turbulence model with various discretization and pressure interpolation schemes were plotted and compared against experimental measurement adopted from literature,showing a plausibly good agreement with second order upwind scheme and standard pressure interpolation scheme. It was found that predicted flow field has a great influence to the silo height. Higher mean velocity in downward direction was predicted in the center region closer {{to the top of the}} silo due to gravitational force on the particles. Moreover, it was found that turbulence flow (RMS velocity) is correspondingly increase with increasing the axial positions, indicating that region closer to the feeding inlet favor the initial turbulence formation. This suggests that combination of RNG turbulence model and DPM could be employed in dust cloud formation study...|$|R

40|$|In {{the design}} of a {{drainage}} system, allowable drainage flow quantity (drainage capability) is defined for each pipe diameter in order to prevent seal water from breaking. In Japan, SHASE-S 218 (Heating, Air-Conditioning, and Sanitary Standard) stipulates the evaluation standard for drainage capability. Regardless of {{the presence or absence of}} connection of the traps, there are two types of test criteria.

Air {{drilling}} {{technology has}} been widely used in {{the oil and gas}} exploration, coal, geothermal, geological exploration, nuclear industry and other fields due to its high drilling rate and low cost. However, the design of the pneumatic conveying system for the mineral detritus is still largely based on empiricism. The paper was set in the background of gas drilling, mainly studied the gas-solids two-phase flow characteristics in 90 degree bent annular pipe and backward-facing step of an annular pipe, which are very important parts of air drilling. They refer to the bent part and backward-facing step of an annular channel formed by the drill pipe and the borehole wall. A detailed numerical simulation and experimental studies were carried out for the flow structure and pressure losses of gas-solid two-phase in the annular pipe of gas drilling. Since a unified theory has not been developed for the two-phase flow in annular pipe, a lot of experimental work should be conducted. In the experimental research, the paper independently designed and built an annular <b>pipe</b> <b>pneumatic</b> conveying system with 90 degree bend and backward-facing step, including designing material screw feeder, material receiving hopper, pipeline, control system, data acquisition system, and etc. As known, many parameters, such as gas velocity, diameter and density of the particle, and solids loading ratio, can influence the conveying process.

40|$|Surface {{damage that}} caused by impact of solid {{particles}} is called erosive wear. The phenomenon becomes {{a serious problem}} for bended section of <b>pneumatic</b> transportation <b>pipe,</b> valve, turbine blade and fun, and so on. In order to reach an aim of high safety and low cost, it’s important to develop wear resistant material and to estimate of life service during erosion. Recently, many researches have studied on the variety of alloys, and tempt to develop wear resistant materials. In this study, the multi-component cast irons, which are excellent war resistant materials due to containing strong carbides forming elements, Crystallization of hard eutectic carbides at the solidification and occurring secondary hardening in matrix by heat treatment was paid attention. Therefore, multi-component cast irons with about 3 %C, 10 %, 7. 5 % and 5 %V cast irons with nill, 5 and 9 %Cr and 2 %C and Cr, Mo, W and V, (As an alternative to Nb) of about 5 % with 0, 5 and 10 %Co were prepared as the test materials in this study. This study investigates erosive wear characteristics of multi-component cast irons. In 1 st chapter, I described the research background, previous research and the purpose and significance of this study. In 2 nd chapter I melted the variety of multi-component cast irons and subsequent identification of the eutectic carbides, precipitated carbides and matrix. In 3 rd chapter, I described that I used the Fe-C-Mn-Cr-V-based multi-component cast irons were melted in the second chapter as specimens, promoting the erosive wear test, to reduce of V contents and increasing of Cr contents were investigated whether it’s possible to increasing wear resistance and cost reduction. In 4 th chapter, I used the Fe-C-Cr-Mo-W based multi-component cast irons were melted in the 2 nd chapter as test materials, I investigates erosive wear characteristics of Fe-C-Cr-Mo-W multi-component cast irons containing V, Nb and Co. In 5 th chapter, we used the Fe-C-Cr-Mo-W-based multi-component cast irons, which showed excellent wear resistance in Chapter IV. To promote a high temperature erosion wear test, I revealed that effect of Co addition on high temperature erosive wear characteristics of multi-component cast irons containing Nb or V. In 6 th chapter, summarize {{results of the present}} research. 室蘭工業大学 (Muroran Institute of Technology) 博士（工学...|$|R
