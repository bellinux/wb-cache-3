40|$|In {{this paper}} we report {{a study of}} the effects of {{splenectomy}} on the immunosuppressive action of essential fatty acids (EFA) which is thought to be mediated through prostaglandins (PG) produced in the spleen. Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in normal, splenectomized and sham splenectomized Lewis rats. EFA were administered orally, the animals in the control groups being treated with liquid <b>paraffin.</b> <b>Treatment</b> with EFA significantly suppressed clinical disease in those animals in which EAE was induced by the inoculation of central nervous system material of guinea-pigs or by passive transfer by Con A-stimulated spleen cells. Splenectomy abrogated the suppressive effect of EFA. This observation, together with previous results showing the abrogation of EFA immunosuppression by an inhibitor of the biosynthesis of PG from EFA, led us to postulate a close relationship between EFA, PG and a splenic factor suppressing immunopathological mechanisms in EAE...|$|E

This study were assessed the efficacy of polyethylene Glycol (PEG) and <b>Paraffin</b> in <b>treatment</b> of childhood CFC. Material and Methods: Functional constipation is defined as a non anatomical constipation. A total of 126 functional constipated children aged 1 - 15 years, systematic randomly divided into two therapeutic groups: group 1 (PEG without electrolytes 40 %, 1 cc/kg/d, twice a day) and group 2 (Paraffin, 1 cc/kg, twice daily). Children were divided into three age groups 12 - 23 mon, 24 - 59 mon and over 60 months and then the therapeutic response in each group were assessed separately. In order to evaluation of the drugs effects, we were scored to 5 following main criteria according to the severity of symptoms: stool frequency per week, pain and blood with stools, stool consistency and number of encopresis per month. At the end of one therapeutic month, the score obtained by each drug was compared with each other. Collected dada were analyzed by using SPSS software, mcNemar test, sign test, independent t test and pair-t test. At the end of first therapeutic month, increasing of stool frequency was 34 (70. 8 %) in group 1 and 29 (53. 7 %) in group 2 and improvement of stool consistency in group 1 and 2 were 66. 6 and 50. 90 %, respectively. Pain with stool was decreased 36. 36 % in group 1 and 31. 25 % in group 2.

40|$|On a per-weight basis, {{the brain}} is the organ richest in lipids, {{including}} a remarkable proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of the omega 3 series, namely eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids. The cerebral effects of exogenous DHA likely depend on its degree of incorporation into neuronal phospholipids and on its distribution among the various brain structures, after intake. Hence, because PUFAs are not evenly distributed among the brain phospholipid classes and because the existence of class-specific phospholipases that regulate their turnover, we sought to investigate the incorporation of omega 3 PUFAs in selected brain areas regions and specific phospholipid classes. Rats (n= 7) were administered, by oral gavage, 100 mg/kg/d of a commercially available fish oil (containing similar to 84 % of long-chain omega 3 fatty acids, of which similar to 38 % of DHA and similar to 46 % of EPA). Control rats (n= 7) received liquid <b>paraffin.</b> This <b>treatment</b> was continued for 30 days. Thereafter, we dissected three areas, namely the hippocampus, the striatum, and the cortex. Quantization of individual phospholipid classes and their molecular species was performed by ESI-MS/MS. Principal component {{analysis was used to}} examine the variation of the molecular lipid profiles (as percentage) induced by omega 3 supplementation. Our results show that provision of omega 3 fatty acids to rats results in their incorporation into brain phospholipids, the extent of which is lower in the striatum as compared with cortex and hippocampus. These data might in part explain the mixed therapeutic results obtained in neurological disorders, many of which are likely region-specific. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the effect of thermal pre-treatment in particles of strand type with the effect of variables of production on physical-mechanical properties of OSB panels, aiming to improve their dimensional stability. The experimental design consisted on five treatments with the assessment of two temperatures of thermal treatment on particles (200 and 240 °C) during 60 minutes; the increase of adhesive content, the application of <b>paraffin</b> in different <b>treatments</b> and a control treatment. For each treatment three panels with Phenol-Formaldehyde adhesive were produced. The cycle of pressing panels was: pressure of 3. 5 MPa and temperature 160 °C during 8 minutes.

The increase on adhesive content resulted in a significant improvement of WA 24 h, and the application of paraffin improved the WA 2 h and TS 2 h of panels, however such treatments were not so efficient on keeping the dimensional stability of OSB panels as a thermal treatment applied on particles at 240 °C...|$|R
40|$|Background. Osteopontin (OPN) is a {{multifunctional}} cytokine {{involved in}} cell survival, migration, and adhesion. However, {{its role in}} chemosensitivity in locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in humans {{has not yet been}} investigated. Methods. We enrolled 121 patients with locally advanced stage IVA/B OSCC receiving cisplatin-based IC followed by CCRT from January 1, 2006, through January 1, 2012. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess OPN expression in OSCC patients’ biopsy specimens from <b>paraffin</b> blocks before <b>treatment.</b> In addition, MTT/colony formation assay was used to estimate the influence of OPN in an oral cancer cell line treated with cisplatin. Results. Of the 121 patients, 94 had positive OPN findings and 52 responded to IC followed by CCRT. Positive osteopontin immunostaining also correlated significantly with positive N status/TNM stage/male gender and smoking. Univariate analyses showed that patients whose tumors had a low expression of OPN were more likely to respond to chemotherapy and have a significantly better OS than those whose tumors had a high expression of OPN. Multivariate analysis revealed that prolonged survival was independently predicted for patients with stage IVA disease, negative lymph nodes, and negative expressions of OPN and for those who received chemotherapy with Docetaxel/cisplatin/fluorouracil (TPF). An oral cancer line stimulated with OPN exhibited a dose-dependent resistance to cisplatin treatment. Conversely, endogenous OPN depletion by OPN-mediated shRNA increased sensitivity to cisplatin. Conclusions. A positive expression of OPN predicts a poor response and survival in patients with locally advanced stage IVA/B OSCC treated with cisplatin-based IC followed by CCRT...|$|R

OBJECTIVE: To analyse the effect of infliximab on the immunopathology of rheumatoid nodules in order to provide new insights into the relationship between synovial inflammation and rheumatoid nodules. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nodules were present at baseline in six patients with RA and after infliximab treatment in five patients, including paired nodules before and after treatment in three patients. In one patient, the nodule appeared during <b>treatment.</b> <b>Paraffin</b> sections were used for histological analysis. Frozen sections were stained by immunohistochemistry for cellular markers (CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, CD 16, CD 20, CD 68), blood vessels (CD 146, vWF, alphavbeta 3), and adhesion molecules (E-selectin, VCAM- 1, ICAM- 1). RESULTS: No manifest immunopathological {{differences were found between the}} nodules before and after infliximab treatment. All nodules depicted the classical structure with a central necrotic zone, surrounding the palisade layer, and an outer connective tissue zone. Immunohistochemistry showed the presence of CD 68 + and CD 16 + macrophages in the palisade and the connective tissue zone, as well as a small number of CD 3 +, CD 4 + T lymphocytes in the perivascular areas. Small vessels were seen in the connective tissue and were sometimes positive for the neovascularisation marker alphavbeta 3. They expressed no VCAM- 1, E-selectin weakly, but ICAM- 1 strongly.

40|$|BACKGROUND: CD 4 + T cell {{depletion}} {{and destruction}} and the involution of the lymphoid tissue are hallmarks of HIV infection. Although {{the underlying mechanisms}} are still unclear, apoptosis appears to play a central role. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of antiretroviral therapy on the lymph node tissue, particularly with respect to morphology and apoptosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1997 and 1999, two inguinal lymph nodes were excised from 31 previously untreated individuals who were in an early stage of HIV infection, the first one prior to treatment and the second after 16 to 20 months of <b>treatment.</b> <b>Paraffin</b> sections were investigated for lymph node architecture, distribution of cellular and viral markers, apoptosis, and expression of apoptotic key molecules which indirectly reflect apoptotic processes. RESULTS: After 16 - 20 months of antiretroviral therapy, a significant decrease in highly activated HIV-driven immune response was observed in the lymph node tissue as a marked reduction in follicular hyperplasia, a normalization of the follicular dendritic cell network, a significant increase in the number of CD 4 + T cells, and a significant decrease in the number of CD 8 + T cells. The expression of several proapoptotic (Fas, TRAIL, and active caspase 3) and antiapoptotic (Bcl- 2 and IL- 7 Ralpha) molecules that were reconstituted in the tissues during therapy resembled their expression in lymph nodes of HIV-negative individuals. Limitations of the study are (a) the lack of untreated patients in the late stages, (b) for ethical reasons, the lack of a control group with untreated patients, and (c) for methodological reasons, the restriction of sequential measurements of apotpotic markers to one-third of the patients. CONCLUSION: Antiretroviral therapy initiated in the early stages in HIV infection may halt the irreversible destruction of the lymph node tissue and may partially normalize apoptotic processes...|$|R

Meanwhile caffeine alone showed histological pattern more or less near to normal. On the other hand -rays combined with I. P. injection of caffeine revealed vaculated hepatocytes with dilated blood sinusoids. Histochemical changes were also observed showing significant increase in both acid phosphatase and succinic dehydrogenase enzymes activity after one and three days post exposure while the alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity showed significant decrease after one day and increase after three days of exposure. Administration of caffeine (1, 3, 7 -trimethylzanthine), a major component of coffee (80 mg/Kg body weight), 60 min prior to whole body lethal dose of gamma-irradiation (7 Gy) resulted in improvement of the radiation induced changes in the activity of measured enzymes...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} several biological markers that may predict the response of muscle invasive transitional cell carcinoma TCC of the bladder to radical radiotherapy. The specific markers chosen were tumour angiogenesis (CD 31 &CD 34), tumour cell proliferation (Ki- 67) and apoptosis (bcl- 2), intratumour macrophage infiltration (CD 68) and p 53. Archival formalin fixed <b>paraffin</b> embedded pre <b>treatment</b> bladder biopsies from 101 patients with muscle invasive TCC were obtained. All patients subsequently received radical radiotherapy as their only treatment for the disease. 4 µm sections were graded according to the WHO grading system and staged by the TNM classification. Angiogenesis (CD 31 &CD 34) counts were obtained using a 25 -point Chalkley eyepiece graticule. Bcl- 2 scored as positive and negative, while p 53, Ki- 67 and CD 68 were estimated using an eyepiece graticule. The medical records were examined to assess the response of the tumour at the 3 -month post radiotherapy cystoscopy and the long-term outcome. Patients were classified into two groups in two sections: the first section includes (1) those free of disease (no tumour detected in the bladder at the 3 -month cystoscopy), (2) those with resistant disease (tumour present at 3 months). The second section includes (1) those with persistent or recurrent cancer in the bladder (tumour recurred after an initial 3 months negative check cystoscopy together with patients with resistant disease at 3 months), (2) those free of disease at all subsequent cystoscopies. Detailed statistical analysis revealed that there were no association between any of the markers examined and the response to radiotherapy. MVD using CD 34 was lower in higher stage tumours (p= 0. 050). Females, whilst representing only a small fraction (16) of the total of patients studied showed an inferior response to radiotherapy when compared to that of male patients (p= 0. 048). Higher median haemoglobin levels for the response group (p= 0. 031) was observed as well as a positive significant correlation between p 53 (L 1) expression and MIB- 1 (LI) (r= 0. 332, p= 0. 001). The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis shows that the survival time is significantly better for those who were exposed longer to radiotherapy (> 33 days) (Log Rank, p= 0. 0246). There was a significantly higher survival time for patients who have CD 68 higher than 42. 4 (log rank, p=D. 036). The study concluded that none of the selected markers could be used as prognostic value in determining patients most suitable for radiotherapy as primary treatment with curative intent for their bladder cancer.
