The fire sped up a process by the city of Salamanca, who has considering demolishing the building within two to three months of the fire. Salamanca Mayor Carmen Vecchiarella noted that he had met with members of the Seneca Nation earlier in the month to discuss demolition of the Nation owned structure, which kept the building secure. The Salamanca Police Department noted that the station depot was secure and never been a source of trouble for the patrol team, unlike the one of the former Fancher Furniture Company structure on Rochester Street which burned due to arson in 2010.|$|E
500|$|The 2000 {{season was}} {{considered}} a make-or-break season for Fassel. Like his predecessor, Dan Reeves, Fassel had enjoyed great success in his first year, but disappointment in the following two seasons. The conventional wisdom was that the Giants needed {{to have a strong}} year for Fassel to retain his job. The Giants' big draft acquisition was running back Ron Dayne, Heisman Trophy winner from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Before the draft the team was debating whether to select Dayne or Shaun Alexander. The plan for Dayne was that the <b>power</b> <b>running</b> style he had at Wisconsin would complement Barber's speed and pass-catching ability. The two were dubbed [...] "Thunder and Lightning".|$|E

500|$|In {{their final}} game of the season, Penn State looked to play spoiler and try to prevent Wisconsin from {{achieving}} a 10-win season and BCS Bowl opportunity in coach Gary Andersen's first season with the Badgers, who entered the game with a 9–2 record and were 24-point favorites to win the game. The Badgers entered the game still employing their quintessential offensive philosophy even under their new coach – a <b>power</b> <b>running</b> game behind a physical offensive line led by two of the top rushers in the country, Melvin Gordon and James White, both of whom were on the preseason watchlist for the Doak Walker Award (given to the nation's best running back) and the former of whom was named one of ten semifinalists for the award in mid-November. White, a tough runner {{in the middle of the}} field, had emerged in recent weeks, whereas Gordon, a speedster, led the team in rushing and led the country with an 8.2 yards-per-carry average. Wisconsin's offense also featured a strong passing game, highlighted by quarterback Joel Stave and favorite target Jared Abbrederis, however one game preview asserted that Penn State's defense matched up well against the Badgers' offense. Defensively, Wisconsin entered the game the fifth-best scoring defense in the country, allowing just 13.4 points per game. The [...] "stingy" [...] defense, the preview noted, would likely prove problematic for Penn State.|$|E

2500|$|During the offseason, the Tiger-Cats signed {{running back}} Ron Williams. Williams {{was known for}} <b>power</b> <b>running</b> and was {{described}} as a [...] "210-pound battering ram" [...] by The Hamilton Spectator. The presence of Williams allowed the Tiger-Cats to develop Amerson further as a receiving back, and the team further experimented by designing plays where Amerson lined up as a slotback and using him as a kick returner. He went on to catch 65 passes for 750 yards and five touchdowns in addition to rushing for 703 yards and three touchdowns. Amerson immediately established himself as a viable receiving option in the season opener against Calgary when he caught six passes for 103 yards and two touchdowns. In late July, Amerson caught a short pass and ran 74 yards for a touchdown against the Stampeders. The play was described as [...] "the Ticats' biggest play so far this season". Amerson remained effective on the ground, rushing for 114 yards in an early August game against the Edmonton Eskimos, but he continued to struggle with fumbles throughout the season.|$|E
2500|$|The {{journalist}} David Halberstam {{wrote of}} Stevenson that [...] "he {{had played a}} historic role for his party, twice its presidential candidate, the first time running against impossible odds in 1952, {{at the height of}} the Korean War and McCarthyism, with the [...] party already decaying from the scandals of twenty years in <b>power.</b> <b>Running</b> against the great hero of the era, Dwight Eisenhower, Stevenson had lost, of course, but his voice had seemed special in that moment, a voice of rationality and elegance. In the process of defeat he had helped to salvage the party, giving it a new vitality and bringing to its fold a whole new generation of educated Americans, volunteers now in the political process, some very professional amateurs who would be masterly used by the Kennedys in 1960. If John and Robert Kennedy seemed to symbolize style in politics, much of that was derived directly from Stevenson. He had, at what should have been a particularly low point for the party, managed to keep it vibrant and vital, and to involve a new kind of people in politics." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{received}} three standing ovations {{from the}} record Metrodome crowd of 62,075, producing a Vikings win after four successive losses and 14 of the prior 18 matches with the Packers. However, his production thereafter declined. The {{problem was that the}} Vikings refused to make Heschel Walker the centerpiece of their offense and Walker couldn't use his custom tailored running scheme made by Dallas; which was <b>power</b> <b>running</b> between the tackles from the I-formation with a blocking fullback in front of him, to save the Vikings. Instead of looking at their own schemes, the team questioned his talent and commitment to football. He joined the Bobsled program of the United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation, earning a berth in the 1992 Winter Olympics. Scout.com says, [...] "Walker was never used properly by the coaching brain trust." [...] "Herschel the Turkey", a mock honor given out by the Star Tribune newspaper to inept Minnesota sports personalities, is named for him. Walker played for the Vikings {{for two and a half}} years, never amassing 1,000 rushing yards in a season.|$|E

60|$|He went on now to {{tell her}} of his love for her, in words which bore, even to her {{critical}} senses, the stamp of truth; {{but none of this}} touched her, until, coming to a gate whose hinge was rusty, he heaved it open with his shoulder, still talking and taking no account of his effort. The virility of this deed impressed her; and yet, normally, she attached no value to the power of opening gates. The strength of muscles has nothing to do {{on the face of it}} with the strength of affections; nevertheless, she felt a sudden concern for this <b>power</b> <b>running</b> to waste on her account, which, combined with a desire to keep possession of that strangely attractive masculine power, made her rouse herself from her torpor.|$|E
6000|$|... {{it is very}} {{difficult}} to say which is the principal note. The A in the last bar is slightly dominant, but there is a very equal current of <b>power</b> <b>running</b> through the whole; and such passages rarely weary. And this principle holds through vast scales of arrangement; so that in the grandest compositions, such as Paul Veronese's Marriage in Cana, or Raphaels Disputa, it is not easy to fix at once on the principal figure; and very commonly the figure which is really chief does not catch the eye at first, but is gradually felt to be more and more conspicuous as we gaze. Thus in Titian's grand composition of the Cornaro Family, the figure meant to be principal is a youth of fifteen or sixteen, whose portrait it was evidently the painter's object to make as interesting as possible. But a grand Madonna, and a St. George with a drifting banner, and many figures more, occupy the center of the picture, and first catch the eye; little by little we are led away from them to a gleam of pearly light in the lower corner, and find that, from the head which it shines upon, we can turn our eyes no more.|$|E
60|$|I see {{you are not}} {{tired of}} the candle yet, or I am sure {{you would not be}} {{interested}} in the subject in the way you are. When our candle was burning, we found it produced water exactly like the water we have around us; and by further examination of this water we found in it that curious body, hydrogen--that light substance of which there is some in this jar. We afterwards saw the burning powers of that hydrogen, and that it produced water. And I think I introduced to your notice an apparatus which I very briefly said was an arrangement of chemical force, or power, or energy, so adjusted as to convey its power to us in these wires; and I said I should use that force to pull the water to pieces, to see what else there was in the water besides hydrogen; because, you remember, when we passed the water through the iron tube, we by no means got the weight of water back which we put in, in the form of steam, though we had a very large quantity of gas evolved. We have now to see what is the other substance present. That you may understand the character and use of this instrument, let us make an experiment or two. Let us put together, first of all, some substances, knowing what they are, and then see what that instrument does to them. There is some copper (observe the various changes which it can undergo), and here is some nitric acid, and you will find that this, being a strong chemical agent, will act very powerfully when I add it to the copper. It is now sending forth a beautiful red vapour; but as we do not want that vapour, Mr. Anderson will hold it near the chimney for a short time, that we may have the use and beauty of the experiment without the annoyance. The copper which I have put into the flask will dissolve: it will change the acid and the water into a blue fluid, containing copper and other things; and I propose then shewing you how this voltaic battery deals with it; and in the mean-time we will arrange another kind of experiment for you to see what power it has. This is a substance which is to us like water--that is to say, it contains bodies which we do not know of as yet, as water contains a body which we do not know as yet. Now, this solution of a salt[15] I will put upon paper, and spread about, and apply the power of the battery to it, and observe what will happen. Three or four important things will happen which we shall take advantage of. I place this wetted paper upon a sheet of tinfoil, which is convenient for keeping all clean, and also for the advantageous application of the power; and this solution, you see, is not at all affected by being put upon the paper or tinfoil, nor by anything else I have brought in contact with it yet, and which, therefore, is free to us to use as regards that instrument. But first let us see that our instrument is in order. Here are our wires. Let us see whether it is in the state in which it was last time. We can soon tell. As yet, when I bring them together, we have no power, because the conveyers--what we call the electrodes--the passages or ways for the electricity--are stopped; but now Mr. Anderson by that [referring to a sudden flash at the ends of the wires] has given me a telegram {{to say that it is}} ready. Before I begin our experiment I will get Mr. Anderson to break contact again at the battery behind me, and we will put a platinum-wire across to connect the poles, and then if I find I can ignite a pretty good length of this wire, we shall be safe in our experiment. Now you will see the power. [The connection was established, and the intermediate wire became red-hot.] There is the <b>power</b> <b>running</b> beautifully through the wire, which I have made thin on purpose to shew you that we have those powerful forces; and now, having that power, we will proceed with it to the examination of water.|$|E
