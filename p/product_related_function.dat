40|$|An {{emerging}} trend in defence and aerospace is {{the move from}} manufacturing and selling products to providing {{the availability of a}} product-related function based on long term contractual agreements between the customer and the service provider. Therefore the concern of the manufacturer as a service provider shifts towards all means that are required to ensure the availability of the <b>product</b> <b>related</b> <b>function.</b> This ultimately imposes the adoption of a broader perspective on a complex system of interconnected and interdependent activities undertaken by a diverse network of stakeholders for the achievement of a common purpose. Nonetheless, a consistent and comprehensive way to represent such complex systems is not yet agreed upon in the literature. For the purpose of estimating the costs of a Product Service System (PSS) delivery, a consistent and common representation of products and services is a necessary precondition. The focus {{of this paper is to}} contribute to the debate by proposing the use of knowledge as the underlying foundation for representing products, services and PSS. Building upon inter-disciplinary literature, differing concepts of PSS are discussed, in order to identify recurring aspects and commonalities between product and service. While it could be recognised that technology represents such a common element, it is also recognised that differing definitions of technology do not facilitate the discussion about product, service, and PSS. Instead, evidence is found for the argument that applied knowledge can be seen as the underlying foundation for products, service and PSS. In this sense, knowledge is not considered as a single asset, but rather a composition of different kinds of knowledge. The authors propose the application of knowledge to a process-based approach, which facilitates the representation of products and services by overcoming their distinction in a consistent way. While the composition of knowledge related to each process is a necessary precondition to enable the successful delivery of a PSS, it furthermore requires knowledge about integration of all process inputs, outputs and the processes' dynamics within a given environment. Herewith the focus shifts to the preconditions that enable the successful delivery of a PSS, such as available set of skills and underlying process understanding. Discussing the role knowledge plays in current cost estimation methods it is found that - despite its importance - knowledge is not always clearly defined, and very often it is reduced to repository-based data retrieval systems. The proposed knowledge-based process-orientated approach aims to facilitate investigating products, services, PSS, and the underlying production and delivery systems by representing them in a transparent and consistent way. While this is generally not bound to a particular type of analysis, the motivation originates from estimating the costs of a PSS deliver...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{function}} offers a high potential for thinking and reasoning about designs {{as well as}} providing a common thread for relating together other design information. This paper focuses specifically on the relation between function and risk by presenting a mathematical mapping from product function to risk likelihood. This risk information is composed of design parameters, failure modes, and likelihood values. A spacecraft orientation subsystem, subsystem used to guide science instruments, and a Bell 206 rotorcraft are used to test the mapping which continues research on these <b>products</b> <b>relating</b> <b>function</b> to failure. Finally, a case study is presented in which the risk element likelihood is calculated for a fuel cell which is in the conceptual design phase at NASA JPL...|$|R

Then, if we restrict the approximations to rational numbers of the shape $d^s/N$, we may replace Bundschuh's irrationality exponent $ 7 / 3 $ by $ 2 +\frac{ 1 }{ 3 + 2 \sqrt 3 }= 2. 1547 [...] . $...|$|R
40|$|In 1986, Mosmann and Coffman {{identified}} 2 subsets of activated CD 4 T cells, Th 1 and Th 2 cells, which {{differed from}} each other in their pattern of cytokine production and their functions. Our understanding {{of the importance of the}} distinct differentiated forms of CD 4 T cells and of the mechanisms through which they achieve their differentiated state has greatly expanded over the past 2 decades. Today at least 4 distinct CD 4 T-cell subsets have been shown to exist, Th 1, Th 2, Th 17, and iTreg cells. Here we summarize much of what is known about the 4 subsets, including the history of their discovery, their unique cytokine <b>products</b> and <b>related</b> <b>functions,</b> their distinctive expression of cell surface receptors and their characteristic transcription factors, the regulation of their fate determination, and the consequences of their abnormal activation...|$|R
40|$|The yeast genes RNA 2 -RNA 11 are {{necessary}} for splicing of nuclear intron-containing pre-mRNAs. We investigated the relationships among these genes by asking whether increased expression of one RNA gene leads to suppression of the temperature-sensitive lethality of a mutation in any other RNA gene. The presence of extra plasmid-borne copies of the RNA 3 gene relieves the lethality of temperature-sensitive rna 4 mutations. A region of the yeast genome (SRN 2) is described that suppresses temperature-sensitive rna 2 mutations when it is present on either medium or high-copy number plasmids. Neither suppression occurs via a bypass of RNA gene function since null alleles of rna 2 and rna 4 are not suppressed by elevated dosage of SRN 2 and RNA 3, respectively. These {{results suggest that the}} SRN 2 and RNA 2 gene <b>products</b> have <b>related</b> <b>functions,</b> as do the RNA 3 and RNA 4 gene products...|$|R
40|$|The 2 B 5 {{region on}} the X {{chromosome}} of Drosophila melanogaster forms an early ecdysone puff {{at the end}} of the third larval instar. The region contains a complex genetic locus, the Broad-Complex (BR-C) composed of four groups of fully complementing (br, rbp, l(1) 2 Bc, and l(1) 2 Bd) alleles, and classes of noncomplementing (npr 1) and partially noncomplementing l(1) 2 Bab alleles. BR-C mutants prevent metamorphosis, including the morphogenesis of imaginal discs. Results are presented that indicate that the BR-C contains two major functional domains. One, the br domain is primarily, if not exclusively, involved in the elongation and eversion of appendages by imaginal discs. The second, the l(1) 2 Bc domain, is primarily involved in the fusion of discs to form a continuous adult epidermis. Nonetheless, the two domains may encode <b>products</b> with <b>related</b> <b>functions</b> because in some situations mutants in both domains appear to affect similar developmental processes...|$|R
40|$|Disruption {{of newly}} {{identified}} {{genes in the}} pathogen Candida albicans is a vital step in determination of gene function. Several gene disruption methods described previously employ long regions of homology flanking a selectable marker. Here, we describe disruption of C. albicans genes with PCR products that have 50 to 60 bp of homology to a genomic sequence on each end of a selectable marker. We used the method to disrupt two known genes, ARG 5 and ADE 2, and two sequences newly identified through the Candida genome project, HRM 101 and ENX 3. HRM 101 and ENX 3 are homologous to genes in the conserved RIM 101 (previously called RIM 1) and PacC pathways of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus nidulans. We show that three independent hrm 101 /hrm 101 mutants and two independent enx 3 /enx 3 mutants are defective in filamentation on Spider medium. These observations argue that HRM 101 and ENX 3 sequences are indeed portions of genes and that the respective gene <b>products</b> have <b>related</b> <b>functions...</b>|$|R
40|$|The N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive {{fusion protein}} (NSF) has {{been implicated in}} vesicle {{trafficking}} in perhaps all eukaryotic cells. The Drosophila comatose (comt) gene encodes an NSF homolog, dNSF 1. Our previous work with temperature-sensitive (TS) paralytic alleles of comt has revealed a function for dNSF 1 at synapses, where it appears to prime synaptic vesicles for neurotransmitter release. To further examine the molecular basis of dNSF 1 function and to broaden our analysis of synaptic transmission to other gene products, we have performed a genetic screen for mutations that interact with comt. Here we report the isolation and analysis of four mutations that modify TS paralysis in comt, including two intragenic modifiers (one enhancer and one suppressor) and two extragenic modifiers (both enhancers). The intragenic mutations will contribute to structure-function analysis of dNSF 1 and the extragenic mutations identify gene <b>products</b> with <b>related</b> <b>functions</b> in synaptic transmission. Both extragenic enhancers result in TS behavioral phenotypes when separated from comt, and both map to loci not previously identified in screens for TS mutants. One of these mutations is a TS paralytic allele of the calcium channel alpha 1 -subunit gene, cacophony (cac). Analysis of synaptic function in these mutants alone and in combination will further define the in vivo functions and interactions of specific gene products in synaptic transmission...|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{mechanisms}} {{associated with}} pathophysiological changes in ventricular remodelling due to myocardial infarction (MI) remain poorly understood. We analyzed changes in gene expression by microarray technology in porcine myocardial tissue at 1, 4, and 6 weeks post-MI. MI was induced by coronary artery ligation in 9 female pigs (30 - 40 kg). Animals were randomly sacrificed at 1, 4, or 6 weeks post-MI (n = 3 per group) and 3 healthy animals were also included as control group. Total RNA from myocardial samples was hybridized to GeneChip® Porcine Genome Arrays. Functional analysis was obtained with the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) online tool. Validation of microarray data {{was performed by}} quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). More than 8, 000 different probe sets showed altered expression in the remodelling myocardium at 1, 4, or 6 weeks post-MI. Ninety-seven percent of altered transcripts were detected in the infarct core and 255 probe sets were differentially expressed in the remote myocardium. Functional analysis revealed 28 genes de-regulated in the remote myocardial region {{in at least one}} of the three temporal analyzed stages, including genes associated with heart failure (HF), systemic sclerosis and coronary artery disease. In the infarct core tissue, eight major time-dependent gene expression patterns were recognized among 4, 221 probe sets commonly altered over time. Altered gene expression of ACVR 2 B, BID, BMP 2, BMPR 1 A, LMNA, NFKBIA, SMAD 1, TGFB 3, TNFRSF 1 A, and TP 53 were further validated. The clustering of similar expression patterns for gene <b>products</b> with <b>related</b> <b>function</b> revealed molecular footprints, some of them described for the first time, which elucidate changes in biological processes at different stages after MI...|$|R

40|$|Essential for organization’s {{existence}} {{is to make}} profit by selling its goods and services. This is quite straight forwarded process, though it requires enabling and supporting functions in order to succeed. With these functions are referred to the organization’s business processes and information systems, which in combined enable and support organization’s sales. Organization’s offering is constantly changing and respectively {{the amount of information}} related is increasing. In addition to the changes, the business requirements and ways of working may change as well. This leads to development of business processes and information systems, which has to adapt for the change. Researched company faces challenges with product data, its management and information system renewals, and at the same time, compliance issues with its parent company. Thus, the research objective is to introduce a holistic model for product data management, which includes the known and upcoming information system renewals and as well considers the mentioned compliance issues. To create a holistic model for product data management within given requirements, a two-part research was conducted consisting of theoretical section and the empirical section. Theoretical section is based on scientific literature about research areas and the empirical section is based on qualitative data analysis, in which the analyzed data is received from total of 17 interviews. With theoretical and empirical sections, the holistic model is created. Results showed that the product data is scattered, deficiency of information, lack of documentation and large quantity of tacit knowledge. For information systems, Product Register is obsolete, ERP-system will be replaced and Sinfos has altered requirements. Recommendations include that <b>product</b> data <b>related</b> <b>functions</b> to be revised, documented and trained properly. In addition, segregation of duties should be revised and person in charge should be named. Product Register should be replaced with a system consisting of product master data and linkage to the new ERP-system, and it covers the changed requirements for Sinfos. Upcoming ERP renewal has to be considered when dealt with other renewals and in information systems architecture. For further research, the effect and execution of implemented solutions for depicted challenges should be studied, in contrast to the theoretical literature...|$|R
