Realizing such delay with a PLL technique, we have been developing low-power and high-density pipeline TDC chips for high-rate tracking detectors. The chip, named Time Memory Cell (TMC), has been adopted in several high-rate experiments and is proposed for the muon high-precision tracker of the ATLAS experiment. With this delay element, we also build a simple high-speed <b>parallel-to-serial</b> <b>converter</b> to solve a pin-count problem in trigger chip.

40|$|A {{modulator}} circuit board {{has recently been}} developed {{to be used in}} conjunction with a vector modulator to generate any {{of a large number of}} modulations for bandwidth-efficient radio transmission of digital data signals at rates than can exceed 100 Mb/s. The modulations include quadrature phaseshift keying (QPSK), offset quadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK), Gaussian minimum-shift keying (GMSK), and octonary phase-shift keying (8 PSK) with square-root raised-cosine pulse shaping. The figure is a greatly simplified block diagram showing the relationship between the modulator board and the rest of the transmitter. The role of the modulator board is to encode the incoming data stream and to shape the resulting pulses, which are fed as inputs to the vector modulator. The combination of encoding and pulse shaping in a given application is chosen to maximize the bandwidth efficiency. The modulator board includes gallium arsenide serial-to-parallel converters at its input end. A complementary metal oxide/semiconductor (CMOS) field-programmable gate array (FPGA) performs the coding and modulation computations and utilizes parallel processing in doing so. The results of the parallel computation are combined and converted to pulse waveforms by use of gallium arsenide <b>parallel-to-serial</b> <b>converters</b> integrated with digital-to-analog converters. Without changing the hardware, one can configure the modulator to produce any of the designed combinations of coding and modulation by loading the appropriate bit configuration file into the FPGA...|$|R
30|$|In Fig.  3, a serial-to-parallel (S/P) {{converter}} is used {{to split}} a binary source of data into two data streams x 1,x 2. Both streams are modulated using QAM, and the resulting symbols are assigned to subcarriers. Afterwards, inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) is performed and data is converted back to a single stream using a <b>parallel-to-serial</b> (P/S) <b>converter,</b> after adding a cyclic prefix (CP). Afterwards, the signal is changed to unipolar by {{using one of the}} O-OFDM schemes. Finally, the data is converted to analog signal s(t) by using a digital-to-analog (D/A) converter along with low pass filter (shaping filter).|$|R

40|$|Implementation of a CMOS {{digital readout}} {{integrated}} circuit (DROIC) based on pixel level digital time delay integration (TDI) for scanning type LWIR focal plane arrays (FPAs) is presented. TDI is implemented on 8 pixels with over sampling rate of 3. Analog signal integrated on integration capacitor {{is converted to}} digital domain in pixel, and digital data is transferred to TDI summation counters, where contributions of 8 pixels are added. Output data is 16 bit, where 8 bits are allocated for most significant bits and 8 bits for least significant bits. Control block of the ROIC, which is responsible of generating timing diagram for switches controlling the pixels and summation counters, is realized with VerilogHDL. Summation counters and <b>parallel-to-serial</b> <b>converter</b> to convert 16 bit parallel output data to single bit output are also realized with Verilog HDL. Synthesized verilog netlists are placed&routed and combined with analog under-pixel part of the design. Quantization noise of analog-to-digital conversion is less than 500 e-. Since analog signal is converted to digital domain in-pixel, inaccuracies due to analog signal routing over large chip area is eliminated.

40|$|The {{serial data}} link has been {{dominant}} in network connections, such as Ethernet, FDDI or ATM, and will find even wider application in the future. This work {{focuses on the}} implementation of some basic building blocks for very high speed serial data communication using CMOS technology. At the transmitter end, a novel <b>parallel-to-serial</b> <b>converter</b> is presented, whose core is a 5 by 4 register matrix which combines the selection and shift schemes for conversion. Using this architecture, a pipelined data loading is applied to multiple data paths running at a sub-multiple of the data rate. This significantly reduces the dynamic power dissipation and eases the system design. The special clock strategy to drive the converter is investigated in this work. SPICE simulations and a chip layout of this method are presented.;At the receiver end, a clock recovery circuit based on a charge pump phase locked loop is proposed. The VCO has an internal feedback loop to adjust the duty cycle at different frequency. A simple conventional phase detector with a limited output swing is used to achieve the high working frequency. A modified symmetrical charge pump circuit improves linearity of the output current versus the input UP and DOWN signal. Some characteristics such as impulse capture range and lock range are estimated from the simulations. All the designs assume 0. 5 um single-poly triple-metal CMOS technology. This work presents an analysis to the system {{as well as individual}} parts and explores the possibility of CMOS solutions for gigabit data communication. It could be used or adopted in future designs in similar applications...|$|E
40|$|In a photon {{counting}} detector array, each pixel in {{the array}} produces an electrical pulse when an incident photon on that pixel is detected. Detection and demodulation of an optical communication signal that modulated {{the intensity of}} the optical signal requires counting the number of photon arrivals over a given interval. As the size of photon counting photodetector arrays increases, parallel processing of all the pixels exceeds the resources available in current application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and gate array (GA) technology; the desire for a high fill factor in avalanche photodiode (APD) detector arrays also precludes this. Through the use of downsampling and windowing portions of the detector array, the processing is distributed between the ASIC and GA. This allows demodulation of the optical communication signal incident on a large photon counting detector array, as well as providing architecture amenable to algorithmic changes. The detector array readout ASIC functions as a <b>parallel-to-serial</b> <b>converter,</b> serializing the photodetector array output for subsequent processing. Additional downsampling functionality for each pixel is added to this ASIC. Due to the large number of pixels in the array, the readout time of the entire photodetector is greater than the time between photon arrivals; therefore, a downsampling pre-processing step is done in order to increase the time allowed for the readout to occur. Each pixel drives a small counter that is incremented at every detected photon arrival or, equivalently, the charge in a storage capacitor is incremented. At the end of a user-configurable counting period (calculated independently from the ASIC), the counters are sampled and cleared. This downsampled photon count information is then sent one counter word at a time to the GA. For a large array, processing even the downsampled pixel counts exceeds the capabilities of the GA. Windowing of the array, whereby several subsets of pixels are designated for processing, is used to further reduce the computational requirements. The grouping of the designated pixel frame as the photon count information is sent one word at a time to the GA, the aggregation of the pixels in a window can be achieved by selecting only the designated pixel counts from the serial stream of photon counts, thereby obviating the need to store the entire frame of pixel count in the gate array. The pixel count se quence from each window can then be processed, forming lower-rate pixel statistics for each window. By having this processing occur in the GA rather than in the ASIC, future changes to the processing algorithm can be readily implemented. The high-bandwidth requirements of a photon counting array combined with the properties of the optical modulation being detected by the array present a unique problem that has not been addressed by current CCD or CMOS sensor array solutions...|$|E
30|$|After {{considering}} all the alternatives, we {{finally decided to}} propose a scheme based on input and output buffers. Such buffers act similarly to two synchronized <b>parallel-to-serial</b> and serial-to-parallel <b>converters.</b> Each set of signals transmitted from an array of IEEE 802.11 p transceivers are stored in a buffer and released at specific time instants, achieving a similar effect as if the parallel transceivers were executed in series. In Table 2, row MIMO 4 × 4, {{it can be seen}} the important resource savings attained by using the time-multiplexing approach, which even consumes 3 % less slices than our old SISO version thanks to some of the previously described optimizations.|$|R

30|$|Since {{the first}} {{introduction}} of quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA), an interesting nanoscale computing paradigm by Lent et al. in 1993 [1], many researchers have embraced its simple concept and {{potential as a}} future processing platform [2 – 6]. In recent years, a group of researchers have presented a generalization of the basic QCA cell, namely the ternary QCA (tQCA) cell [7 – 10], which enables ternary computation. Their principal motivator was the premise that future processing platforms should not disregard the advantages of multi-valued processing [11 – 15]. The group presented the basic ternary building blocks, the inverter, majority gate, wire, corner wire and fan-out, and more recently also, a functionally complete set of ternary logic functions, based on Post Logic, and a memorizing tQCA circuit [16, 17]. Due to the specifics of the tQCA cell, wire crossings seem to be the principal drawback before a more widespread acceptance of tQCA circuitry. Wire crossings {{are one of the most}} used steps in systematic logic design. In the classic, binary QCAs, wires can be crossed either in a coplanar fashion by using rotated QCA cells for one of the wires or in a multilayer fashion where two intermediate layers are used to prevent any possible crosstalk between the two crossing lines [18]. Although the multilayer approach proves to be more robust [19], the majority of designs employ the coplanar one; that is in fact one of the most praised features of classic QCA. Since coplanar crossings tend to be prone to robustness issues, much research has been devoted to its increase, even to the extents of altering the design of QCA logic gates [20 – 22], or as in the case of molecular implementations, through the elimination of crossings by logic gate duplication [23, 24]. Another approach exploits the pipelined nature of QCAs and uses <b>parallel-to-serial</b> <b>converters</b> and a specialized clocking scheme to design a coplanar crossbar network [25]. Coplanar crossings with rotated tQCA cells are not possible, but multilayer crossings are, as it has been reported recently [26]. Here, we go a step further by presenting a wire crossing that is synchronized, i.e., the two wires employ such clocking schemes that the outputs of the two wires have the same effective delay. In addition, the clocking schemes allow for a two-layer design, in other words, removing the requirement for additional layers, whose sole purpose is to prevent possible crosstalk. The article is organized as follows. We first present the overview of a ternary QCA cell, its architecture and inter-cell interaction. We follow by presenting a two-layer design, where we first show the inter-layer interaction followed by presenting the design and clocking scheme of a two-layer synchronized wire crossing.|$|R
