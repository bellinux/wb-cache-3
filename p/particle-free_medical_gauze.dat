50|$|Gauze was {{originally}} made of silk {{and was used}} for clothing. It is now used for many different things, including <b>gauze</b> sponges for <b>medical</b> purposes. When used as a <b>medical</b> dressing, <b>gauze</b> is generally made of cotton. It is especially useful for dressing wounds where other fabrics might stick to the burn or laceration. Many modern <b>medical</b> <b>gauzes</b> are covered with a plastic porous film such as Telfa or a polyblend which prevents direct contact and further minimizes wound adhesion. Also, it can be impregnated with a thick, creamy mixture of zinc oxide and calamine to promote healing, as in Unna's boot.|$|R

50|$|During World War II, Brandon Mill prospered with {{government}} orders for duck cloth, <b>medical</b> <b>gauze,</b> and uniform twill fabric. In December 1946, Abney Mills bought {{the assets of}} Brandon Corporation and began selling the mill village houses. Although textile mills remained reasonably prosperous during the 1950s and '60s, textile manufacturers began offshoring—moving operations outside the United States to countries where labor costs were cheaper. Brandon Mill reduced its workforce in 1969, and the mill closed in 1977.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sets and}} costumes for theater {{productions}} showcased artists’ abilities {{to make something}} out of nothing. Cotton wool was transformed into wigs; <b>medical</b> <b>gauze</b> and fishing nets became lace; bast matting could be made to look like velvet; mess hall stools and canes could be combined to make fine furniture. [...] By a stretch of imagination, artists were able to transform the artifacts of their base conditions into standard scenery, creating for themselves an escape into normalcy.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the thermo-physiological comfort and moisture properties of surgical cotton gauze coated with chitosan (CH). Gauze was coated with CH at mass fractions of 0. 5, 0. 25, 0. 125, 0. 1, 0. 063 wt%. Thermal, moisture management and morphological properties were evaluated. Results indicate that the functionalized <b>medical</b> <b>gauze</b> induces low capilarity, allowing a good degree of moisture and absorption capacity of wound exudates. This biofunctional <b>medical</b> <b>gauze</b> coated with CH 0, 125 wt% demonstrates to deliver an efficient coating and promote the best conditions for maintenance of the wound microenvironment.

40|$|Hemostat {{has been}} a crucial focus since human body is unable to control massive blood loss, and {{collagen}} proves {{to be an effective}} hemostat in previous studies. In this study, collagen was isolated from the mesoglea of jellyfish Rhopilema esculentum Kishinouye and its hemostatic property was studied. The yields of acid-soluble collagen (ASC) and pepsin-soluble (PSC) were 0. 12 % and 0. 28 % respectively. The SDS-PAGE patterns indicated that the collagen extracted from jellyfish mesoglea was type I collagen. The lyophilized jellyfish collagen sponges were cross-linked with EDC and interconnected networks in the sponges were revealed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Collagen sponges exhibited higher water absorption rates than <b>medical</b> <b>gauze</b> and EDC/NHS cross-linking method could improve the stability of the collagen sponges. Compared with <b>medical</b> <b>gauze</b> groups, the blood clotting indexes (BCIs) of collagen sponges were significantly decreased (P < 0. 05) and the concentration of collagen also had an influence on the hemostatic property (P < 0. 05). Collagen sponges had an improved hemostatic ability compared to the gauze control in tail amputation rat models. Hemostatic mechanism studies showed that hemocytes and platelets could adhere and aggregate on the surface of collagen sponge. All properties make jellyfish collagen sponge to be a suitable candidate used as hemostatic material and for wound healing applications...|$|R

50|$|In 2010 when much of Pakistan was {{ravaged by}} severe flooding, the N.A. Sher Foundation {{was quick to}} step in and provide aid. Over 1,000,000 homes were swept away by the raging waters, leaving over twenty million homeless. Many lost {{livestock}} and other possessions in the floods. Surgeon Dr. Sultan Ali, Medical Director for the NASF, led a team of doctors setting up medical camps in five different locations throughout Pakistan. There, they treated over 600 patients afflicted with waterborne, skin, and respiratory diseases free of charge. The N.A. Sher Foundation also set up a tent city, donating 25 tents as temporary housing, and 100 mosquito nets. They also provided 4,000 syringes, 2,000 disposable gloves, <b>medical</b> <b>gauze,</b> and other <b>medical</b> materials.|$|R
40|$|A plasma pad {{that can}} be {{attached}} to human skin was developed for aesthetic and dermatological treatment. A polyimide film {{was used for the}} dielectric layer of the flexible pad, and high-voltage and ground electrodes were placed on the film surface. <b>Medical</b> <b>gauze</b> covered the ground electrodes and was placed facing the skin to act as a spacer; thus, the plasma floated between the gauze and ground electrodes. In vitro and in vivo biocompatibility tests of the pad showed no cytotoxicity to normal cells and no irritation of mouse skin. Antibacterial activity was shown against Staphylococcus aureus and clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Furthermore, skin wound healing with increased hair growth resulting from increased exogenous nitric oxide and capillary tube formation induced by the plasma pad was also confirmed in vivo. The present study suggests that this flexible and wearable plasma pad can be used for biomedical applications such as treatment of wounds and bacterial infections...|$|R
40|$|Objective　To {{study the}} effect of {{polysaccharide}} hemostatic healing sponge in controlling bleeding from femoral artery in miniature swines. Methods　Thirty two miniature pigs were used to reproduce femoral artery hemorrhage model and then divided equally into four groups, and bleeding from femoral artery was treated by Medical Polysaccharide Hemostatic Healing Sponge (MP), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), gelatin sponge (GS) or <b>medical</b> <b>gauze</b> (MG), respectively. Hemostasis time, blood loss and vital signs of these pigs were observed and recorded. Results　There were no group differences in mean arterial pressure. Hemostasis time was earlier and blood loss was less in MP, CMC and GS groups than in MG group, and the hemostatic effect was superior in CMC group to MP and GS groups and similar between the MP and GS groups. Conclusion　MP or CMC dressing could effectively stop femoral artery bleeding, and its hemostatic effect is similar to or slightly better than GS in miniature pigs.

30|$|The animal {{models for}} the femoral head {{necrosis}} with liquid nitrogen freezing method was established after anesthesia with pentobarbital at a dose of 40  mg/kg. Under aseptic conditions, a 2  cm incision was made along the lateral aspect of the hip. Respectively, the superficial fascia, the gluteal muscles and the hip joint capsule was retracted and femoral head exposed. The ligaments were protected with carefully positioned retractors to prevent surrounding soft tissue mostly vessels damage. <b>Medical</b> <b>gauze</b> was used to protect the surrounding tissues from any liquid nitrogen spill. Using a sterile rubber funnel on the femoral head, a medical cotton swabs dipped in liquid nitrogen was applied freezing hip weight-bearing area for 3  min, and then thawing for 30  s. The procedure was repeated three times. Afterwards, tissue layers were sutured. Magnesium rods transfected with BMSCs were implanted into BMSCs group and Magnesium rod group. Postoperatively, animals were injected intramuscularly and eight hourly, Gentamicin at a dosage of 2  mg/kg for three consecutive days. Each animal was placed back in their single cage and allowed for safe recovery. Proper care for wound dressing and hygiene was maintained. Respectively at sixth week and twelfth week, five rabbits in each group were sacrificed under anesthesia (2  % sodium pentobarbital).|$|R
40|$|Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) {{also known}} as V. A. C. (Vacuum-assisted closure), is widely used to manage various type of wounds and {{accelerate}} healing. NPWT {{has so far been}} delivered mainly via opencell polyurethane (PU) foam or <b>medical</b> <b>gauze.</b> In this study an experimental setup of sheep wound model was used to evaluate, under NPWT conditions, the performance of a silicone-coated non-woven polyester (N-WPE) compared with PU foam and cotton hydrophilic gauze, used as reference materials. Animals were anesthetized with spontaneous breathing to create three 3 9 3 cm skin defects bilaterally; each animal received three different samples on each side (n = 6 in each experimental group) and was subjected to negative and continuous 125 mmHg pressure up to 16 days. Wound conditions after 1, 8 and 16 days of treatment with the wound dressings were evaluated based on gross and histological appearances. Skin defects treated with the silicone-coated N-WPE showed a significant decrease in wound size, an increase of re-epithelialization, collagen deposition and wound neovascularisation, and a minimal stickiness to the wound tissue, in comparison with gauze and PU foam. Taken all together these findings indicate that the silicone-coated N-WPE dressing enhances wound healing since stimulates higher granulation tissue formation and causes minor tissue trauma during dressing changes...|$|R
40|$|Quikclot {{has been}} used many years for {{treating}} external hemorrhage in the battle field. In this study, the hemostatic performance of NZG-JY (natural zeolite granules from Jinyun, China) was evaluated and compared with Quikclot in a lethal rabbit model of complex groin injury. Fifty-six anesthetized rabbits were randomized to three different groups: (1) NZG-JY (n = 19); (2) Quikclot (n = 19); and (3) <b>medical</b> <b>gauze</b> (n = 18). Survival was recorded three hours after {{the application of the}} hemostatic agents. The wound healing properties of the survived animals (n = 4 for each group) were observed a week later. The clotting efficiency is 100 % for the animals in the NZG-JY and the Quikclot group, while only 5. 6 % in the gauze group. The mortality in the NZG-JY group (21. 0 %) is significantly less than that in the Quikclot group (52. 6 %) and the gauze group (66. 7 %). A good healing property was achieved in all animals that survived in the NZG-JY group, while three quarters of the animals in the Quikclot group had serious necrotic tissue. NZG-JY significantly decreases the mortality in a lethal rabbit model of complex groin injury and demonstrates good healing properties...|$|R
50|$|Tearfully, Terri {{asks him}} why he is doing this, to which Colin replies that she will see for herself soon. He refuses to tell her their destination. As they pass a police car on the road, Terri flashes her {{headlights}} when she thinks Colin is not looking, hoping to catch their attention. The police car forces them to pull over and a young policeman interrogates them. He requests that Terri {{step out of the}} vehicle, which she does. He asks her if she is all right, to which she is forced to reluctantly agree because Colin is alone with her children in the vehicle. The policeman senses her reluctance, but before he can do anything, Colin steps {{out of the car and}} shoots him dead. He shoves Terri back into the vehicle and they resume their journey. Colin makes Terri drive to a house with the children. This is Alexis' house. She panics when she sees Alexis' dead body in the bedroom. As she tries to find the first-aid kit in the house, the high winds from the storm cause Terri's car alarm to sound off. Worried that the noise will attract attention, Colin binds her hands behind her back and her feet with <b>medical</b> <b>gauze</b> while he goes to check on the car. As Colin exits the house, Alexis' phone rings. Terri manages to free herself from being bound to answer Alexis' ringing phone, and the call turns out to be from Jeffrey (Terri's husband), who is calling Alexis to find out why she hasn't arrived at the hotel yet to meet him. It is only then that Terri realizes that he was not out of town with his father after all and has been having an affair with Alexis. Terri also realizes that the encounter with Colin was not random, and that Colin wants revenge on Jeffrey because of his affair with Alexis. Terri tells her surprised husband the truth and has him call 911. She misleads Colin into thinking that they have escaped and hides her children. When Colin discovers her, she attacks Colin once more, this time grabbing his gun and shooting him until he falls out of a window, dead.|$|R
50|$|In December 2004, medical {{students}} Ravi Menghani, Grant Lee, Willie Siu, and undergraduate Daniel Choi travelled to Nicaragua, {{under the guidance}} of UCLA Pediatric Neurosurgeon Dr. Jorge Lazareff to investigate the high incidence of spina bifida in the region and barriers to healthcare. The initial team visited El Hospital Antonio Lenin Fonseca and observed a significant lack of medical tools, technology, and supplies. They found a need for intervention and presented their work at the 55th annual AMSA Convention in Washington, D.C. Since then Project Nicaragua was founded and has been making yearly visits to Lenin Fonseca, and more recently to La Mascota (children's hospital), to supply the hospitals with important equipment, such as neurosurgical drills, <b>medical</b> textbooks, computers, <b>gauze,</b> gloves, and more. The chapter also established a Scholarship Program at the UNAN, which will fund medical school for three chosen candidates. The scholarship program is designed to resolve boundaries to quality healthcare through a strategic process called capacity building- a process that will empower locals and build a self sustainable social infrastructure that will take a knowledge based approach to effectively eradicate various barriers to healthcare. The team also donated medical supplies, which were provided by Stryker Corporation and UCLA Renew, to the Antonio Lenin Fonseca Hospital in Managua, Nicaragua, where they launched an epidemiology research project, which allowed them to survey 115 patients in the Emergency Room. The team maintained their productivity by continuing their research on Spina Bifida and organizing a health fair at Nandaime, Nicaragua.|$|R
