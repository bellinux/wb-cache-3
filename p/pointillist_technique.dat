25|$|Chevreul {{was perhaps}} the most {{important}} influence on artists at the time; his great contribution was producing a color wheel of primary and intermediary hues. Chevreul was a French chemist who restored tapestries. During his restorations he noticed {{that the only way to}} restore a section properly was to take into account the influence of the colors around the missing wool; he could not produce the right hue unless he recognized the surrounding dyes. Chevreul discovered that two colors juxtaposed, slightly overlapping or very close together, would have the effect of another color when seen from a distance. The discovery of this phenomenon became the basis for the <b>pointillist</b> <b>technique</b> of the Neoimpressionist painters.|$|E
25|$|Le Chahut is a {{conspicuous}} example of Seurat’s <b>pointillist</b> <b>technique.</b> The modulation {{of light and}} shadow throughout the work is obtained by the use of small dots of color juxtaposed side by side while alternating in both intensity and concentrations. The dots are meant to fuse {{in the eye of the}} viewer to create the impression of mixed colors when observed from a distance. While the Impressionists had focused their attention on the harmony of colors based on similar or related hues (only partially separated), the Neo-Impressionists harmony had been based on contrasting hues, pitted one against the other; resulting in a vibrating mélange optique (the optical mixture in the observer's eye).|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} few years, Crnčić spent time {{travelling}} around Croatia, drawing and painting from nature, and exhibiting his work in Zagreb, Opatija and Vienna. In the summer of 1902, he visited the Plitvice Lakes, and at October's exhibition in Opatija, his painting [...] "Blossoming Barberry" [...] was particularly well received. In December of that year, he held a solo exhibit in the E. Artina Salon in Vienna. Following that show, Crnčić received {{a grant from the}} Emperor of 2,000 kruna to create a series of etchings of the Adriatic coast in Primorje and Dalmatia. In the spring 1903 he spent time in Opatija, creating landscapes of Primorje and the Bay of Kvarner characterized by thick impasto brush strokes. Some landscapes of the island of Lošinj were painted in using a <b>pointillist</b> <b>technique.</b> In the summer he was painting the mountainous region of Gorski Kotar.|$|E
50|$|Carl Julius Rudolf Moll (23 April 1861 - 13 April 1945) was a {{prominent}} art nouveau painter active in Vienna {{at the start of}} the 20th century. He was one of the artists of the Vienna Secession who took inspiration from the <b>pointillist</b> <b>techniques</b> of French Impressionists.|$|R
50|$|Moll was a founder-member of the Vienna Secession in 1897 and, in 1903 {{encouraged}} {{the use of}} the Belvedere Gallery to show exhibitions of modern Austrian art. In 1905 he, along with Gustav Klimt, left the Secession, although Moll continued to be involved with the exhibition of art in Vienna including the first exhibition in Vienna of the work of Vincent van Gogh (the second painting above the sideboard in his 1906 self-portrait is Van Gogh's Portrait of the Artist's Mother). His paintings are characterized by the use of <b>pointillist</b> <b>techniques</b> within a strict organization of the surface of the painting.|$|R
5000|$|Angrand's {{implementation}} of <b>Pointillist</b> <b>techniques</b> differed {{from that of}} some of its leading proponents. He painted with a more muted palette than Seurat and Signac, who used bright contrasting colours. As seen in Couple in the street, Angrand used dots of various colours to enhance shadows and provide the proper tone, while avoiding the violent colouration found in many other Neo-Impressionist works. His monochrome conté crayon drawings such as his self-portrait above, which also demonstrate his delicate handling of light and shadow, were assessed by Signac: [...] "... his drawings are masterpieces. It would be impossible to imagine a better use of white and black ... These are the most beautiful drawings, poems of light, of fine composition and execution." ...|$|R
2500|$|After that {{threshold}} was crossed, {{the next}} thirty years became {{a litany of}} amazing experiments. Vincent van Gogh, Dutch born, but living in France, opened the road to expressionism. Georges Seurat, influenced by color theory, devised a <b>pointillist</b> <b>technique</b> that governed the Impressionist experiment and was followed by Paul Signac. Paul Cézanne, a painter's painter, attempted a geometrical exploration of the world, that left many of his peers indifferent. Paul Gauguin, a banker, found symbolism in Brittany [...] along Emile Bernard and then exoticism and primitivism in French Polynesia. Les Nabis, a movement of the 1890s, regrouping painters such as Paul Sérusier, Pierre Bonnard, Édouard Vuillard and Maurice Denis, was influenced by Gauguin's example in Brittany : they explored a decorative art in flat plains with the graphic approach of a Japanese print. They preached that {{a work of art}} is the end product and the visual expression of an artist's synthesis of nature in personal aesthetic metaphors and symbols.|$|E

In this season, he practiced moderate divisionism with elements of <b>pointillist</b> <b>technique.</b> Three paintings of this period that Grabar himself considered seminal (February Glaze, March Snow and Piles of Snow) garnered wide and generally positive critical response. Kazimir Malevich wrote that, {{had it not been for}} linear perspective that Grabar preserved in his March Snow [...] "as a remnant of narrative from the nineteenth century", the whole picture would blend in [...] "a uniform painterly texture" [...] without clearly defined front and middle planes. In 1905 Grabar travelled to Paris to study the new works of French postimpressionists and changed his technique in favor of complete separation of colours. Incidentally, although Grabar appreciated and studied Cézanne, Gauguin and Van Gogh, he himself ranked [...] "the king of painters" [...] Diego Velázquez above them all.|$|E

50|$|Neo-Impressionism {{is a term}} {{coined by}} French art critic Félix Fénéon in 1886 to {{describe}} an art movement founded by Georges Seurat. Seurat’s greatest masterpiece, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, {{marked the beginning of}} this movement when it first made its appearance at an exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants (Salon des Indépendants) in Paris. Around this time, the peak of France’s modern era emerged and many painters were in search of new methods. Followers of Neo-Impressionism, in particular, were drawn to modern urban scenes as well as landscapes and seashores. Science-based interpretation of lines and colors influenced Neo-Impressionists' characterization of their own contemporary art. The <b>Pointillist</b> and Divisionist <b>techniques</b> are often mentioned in this context, because it was the dominant technique {{in the beginning of the}} Neo-impressionist movement.|$|R
40|$|The {{curvature}} of biological membranes at the nanometer scale {{is critically important}} for vesicle trafficking, organelle morphology, and disease propagation. This manuscript reports the development of Polarized Localization Microscopy (PLM), a <b>pointillist</b> optical imaging <b>technique</b> {{for the detection of}} nanoscale membrane curvature in correlation with single-molecule dynamics and molecular sorting. PLM combines polarized total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) and single-molecule localization microscopy to reveal membrane orientation with sub-diffraction-limited resolution without reducing localization precision by point spread function (PSF) manipulation. Further, membrane curvature detection with PLM requires fewer localization events to detect curvature than 3 D single-molecule localization microscopy (e. g., PALM or STORM), which enables curvature detection 10 x faster via PLM than via 3 D single-molecule localizations. With high sensitivity, PLM detects curvature with provides super resolution images with > 10 x signal-to-noise enhancement from diffraction-limited polarized TIRFM. With rotationally confined lipophilic fluorophores and the polarized incident fluorescence excitation, membrane-bending events are revealed with super-resolution. Engineered hemispherical membrane curvature with a radius >= 24 nm was detected with PLM with individual fluorophore have a localization precision of 13 +/- 5 nm. Further, deciphering molecular dynamics as a function of membrane topology was enabled. The diffusion coefficient of individual DiI molecules was 7. 6 x higher in planar supported lipid bilayers than within nanoscale membrane curvature. Comment: 20 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

50|$|Boch {{participated in}} the Neo-Impressionist movement. Her early works used a <b>Pointillist</b> <b>technique,</b> but she {{is best known for}} her Impressionist style which she adopted for most of her career.

50|$|René Francisco's {{studio is}} filled with {{extremely}} interesting paintings. Paint has been layered on canvas with a spatula, using a painstaking, <b>pointillist</b> <b>technique.</b> Most of the paintings have sociological and political themes.

50|$|A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte (Un dimanche après-midi à l'Île de la Grande Jatte) {{painted in}} 1884, {{is one of}} Georges Seurat's most famous works.

5000|$|Hanging in the Impressionist gallery, in the Chrysler Museum of Art, Signac’s 1905 {{painting}} {{is surrounded by}} the likes of Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, and Pierre Renoir. The room is awash with color and movement and amidst it all, The Lagoon is displayed predominantly on the back wall. Next to it hangs Henri-Edmond Cross’s Excursion complementing Signac’s painting. The two works utilize the <b>pointillist</b> <b>technique</b> although they sport notable differences. Cross was a contemporary of Signac’s and the two met at the founding of the Societe des Artistes Independants in 1884; Cross however didn’t practice the theory of divisionism until 1891. Comparing Signac’s painting with Cross’s, both clearly utilize the <b>pointillist</b> <b>technique</b> to the fullest, however The Lagoon is much less delineated in terms of appearance. With The Lagoon, viewers are required to step away from the painting in order to take in the whole image; whereas with Excursion, the entirety of the image can be seen closer to the canvas.|$|E
5000|$|Joseph Urban {{was born}} on May 26, 1872 in Vienna. Urban {{received}} his first architectural commission at age 19 when he was selected to design the new wing of the Abdin Palace in Cairo. He became known {{around the world for}} his innovative use of color, his <b>pointillist</b> <b>technique,</b> and his decorative use of line. He designed buildings throughout the world from Esterhazy Castle in Hungary to the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York.|$|E
50|$|A self-taught artist, Caesar took up {{painting}} {{seriously in}} his early 20s. His early work was influenced by French impressionist artist Georges-Pierre Seurat, {{one of the foremost}} exponents of the <b>pointillist</b> <b>technique.</b> While Seurat built up his compositions from a multitude of tiny coloured spots, Caesar developed his own technique by using simple pens and ink, composing his paintings with thousands of tiny dots. This minutely detailed use of a fountain pen meant that even the smaller works took several months to complete.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{being an}} artist who {{followed}} the established canons dictated by the Salon and the general public, he followed his own inner impulses of artistic creation. Liberated artistic expression, which was called Impressionism, developed {{in the spirit of}} the artists who kept gathering in modernism-oriented marginal galleries in Paris in the 1870s. He knew the spirit of academism and, on the other hand, he felt the spirit of Impressionistic freedom. Having accepted modern principles, Bukovac painted casual pictures, using liberated strokes of the brush, in the <b>pointillist</b> <b>technique.</b>|$|E
50|$|From {{this point}} on, the next thirty years were {{a litany of}} amazing experiments. Vincent van Gogh, Dutch born but living in France, opened the road to expressionism. Georges Seurat, {{influenced}} by color theory, devised a <b>pointillist</b> <b>technique</b> that controlled the Impressionist experiment. Paul Cézanne, a painter's painter, attempted a geometrical exploration of the world (that left many of his peers indifferent). Paul Gauguin, the banker, found symbolism in Brittany and then exoticism and primitivism in French Polynesia. Henri Rousseau, the self-taught dabbler, becomes {{the model for the}} naïve revolution.|$|E
50|$|Her {{early work}} was figurative with a semi-impressionist style. Between 1958 and 1959 her {{work at the}} {{advertising}} agency showed her adoption of a style of painting based on the <b>pointillist</b> <b>technique.</b> Around 1960 she began to develop her signature Op Art style consisting {{of black and white}} geometric patterns that explore the dynamism of sight and produce a disorienting effect on the eye. In the summer of 1960 she toured Italy with mentor Maurice de Sausmarez, and the two visited the Venice Biennale with its large exhibition of Futurist works.|$|E
5000|$|After 1903, his <b>pointillist</b> <b>technique,</b> {{which he}} had used for so many years, became more relaxed and after 1910 he {{abandoned}} it completely. His strokes had become longer and he used more often vivid colours and more intense contrasts, or softened hues. He had become a master in applying light and heat in his paintings. His Olive trees near Nice (1905) {{remind us of the}} technique used by Vincent van Gogh. These longer strokes in red and mauve become prominent in his Bathing ladies under the pine trees at Cavalière (1905) ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{discovered}} the <b>pointillist</b> <b>technique</b> {{when he saw}} Georges Seurat's La Grande Jatte at the eighth impressionist exhibition in Paris in 1886. This shook him up completely. Together with Henry Van de Velde, Georges Lemmen, Xavier Mellery, Willy Schlobach and Alfred William Finch and Anna Boch he [...] "imported" [...] this style to Belgium. Seurat was invited to the next salon of Les XX in Brussels in 1887. But there his La Grande Jatte was heavily criticized by the art critics as [...] "incomprehensible gibberish applied to the noble art of painting".|$|E
5000|$|He later reworks {{his former}} collage and even Polaroid art - series {{with a very}} {{personal}} <b>pointillist</b> <b>technique,</b> {{in which he has}} owned several old and modern aboriginal - techniques. Since the early 1990s, he started with what is still best described as Mosaic or monumental 'tile fragments-Mosaic'. This process also makes a connection with his older monumental photo -collage - work and his more recent pointilistic method. It gives a strong sense of indestructible timelessness.His early video from the 1960s and early 1970s was restored and better protected from the ravages of time by Argos Foundation in Brussels, {{with the support of the}} Flemish Community ...|$|E

50|$|When he was 13, Petitjean {{began his}} art {{studies at the}} Ecole de dessin in Mâcon. The town gave him a grant to {{continue}} at the École des Beaux-Arts where he studied under Alexandre Cabanel and Pierre Puvis de Chavannes. He was later influenced by Georges Seurat whom he met in Paris in 1884. After Seurat encouraged him to join the Neo-Impressionists, he was also influenced by Paul Signac and Camille Pissarro. He adopted the <b>pointillist</b> <b>technique</b> until 1894 {{when he started to}} combine it with more feathery strokes. In 1910, he returned to Neo-Impressionism with a series of decorative watercolours of landscapes and people set off by widely spaced rounded spots of pure colour.|$|E
50|$|Educated at the École des Beaux-Arts, his {{earliest}} passion {{was for the}} great Spanish masters, particularly Jusepe de Ribera. A shift away from his academic style {{took place in the}} late 1880s under the influence of several acquaintances associated with Post-Impressionism and Symbolism. Osbert abandoned naturalistic painting in favour of a <b>Pointillist</b> <b>technique</b> like that employed by Seurat and Signac. Also inspired by Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and the Symbolists, he chose to forsake depiction of real-world subject matter, and developed a poetic visual language of his own. His signature style consists of ghostlike Muses in mysterious landscapes bathed in the unearthly light of a sun or moon, rendered with abundant use of the colour blue. In the 1890s he was associated with Joséphin Péladan and his order of Rosicrucianism.|$|E

5000|$|In {{terms of}} {{technique}} {{his work is}} at times traditional and at times highly original. Alivandi's early paintings, including those from the 1980s, use the now-traditional medium of oil on canvas, yet his aesthetic style, which recalls the stained glass of medieval churches, is highly personal. During the 1990s Alivandi continued to work in oils, but abandoned the traditional canvas, choosing instead to apply his paints directly to newspaper; a method pioneered by the cubists in the early 1900s.Since circa 2000, he increasingly works with the angelique pointillage technique (as seen in {{the image on the}} right), a unique method of painting with extremely small dots of ink which are then covered with a layer of veneer to lock and intensify the colours. This innovative <b>pointillist</b> <b>technique</b> has resulted in the many striking works that demonstrate the beauty of his composition and the power of his vision. According to one critic, his masterful blending of hues has earned him the title [...] "the magician of colours".|$|E

50|$|Gauguin {{returned}} to Paris in June 1885, {{accompanied by his}} six-year-old son Clovis. The other children remained with Mette in Copenhagen, where they {{had the support of}} family and friends while Mette herself was able to get work as a translator and French teacher. Gauguin initially found it difficult to re-enter the art world in Paris and spent his first winter back in real poverty, obliged to take a series of menial jobs. Clovis eventually fell ill and was sent to a boarding school, Gauguin's sister Marie providing the funds. During this first year, he produced very little art. He exhibited nineteen paintings and a wood relief at the eighth (and last) Impressionist exhibition in May 1886. Most of these paintings were earlier work from Rouen or Copenhagen and there was nothing really novel in the few new ones, although his Baigneuses à Dieppe ("Women Bathing") introduced what was to become a recurring motif, the woman in the waves. Nevertheless, Félix Bracquemond did purchase one of his paintings. This exhibition also established Georges Seurat as leader of the avant-garde movement in Paris. Gauguin contemptuously rejected Seurat's Neo-Impressionist <b>Pointillist</b> <b>technique</b> and later in the year broke decisively with Pissarro, who from that point on was rather antagonistic towards Gauguin.|$|E
5000|$|Derain and Matisse worked {{together}} {{through the summer}} of 1905 in the Mediterranean village of Collioure and later that year displayed their highly innovative paintings at the Salon d'Automne. The vivid, unnatural colors led the critic Louis Vauxcelles to derisively dub their works as les Fauves, or [...] "the wild beasts", marking {{the start of the}} Fauvist movement. In March 1906, the noted art dealer Ambroise Vollard sent Derain to London to produce a series of paintings with the city as subject. In 30 paintings (29 of which are still extant), Derain presented a portrait of London that was radically different from anything done by previous painters of the city such as Whistler or Monet. With bold colors and compositions, Derain painted multiple pictures of the Thames and Tower Bridge. These London paintings remain among his most popular work. Art critic T.G Rosenthal: [...] "Not since Monet has anyone made London seem so fresh and yet remain quintessentially English. Some of his views of the Thames use the <b>Pointillist</b> <b>technique</b> of multiple dots, although by this time, because the dots have become much larger, it is rather more simply the separation of colours called Divisionism and it is peculiarly effective in conveying the fragmentation of colour in moving water in sunlight." ...|$|E
