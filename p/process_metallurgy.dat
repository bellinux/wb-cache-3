40|$|Most {{refining}} {{reactions in}} steelmaking involve oxidation of impurity element(s). The product(s) of oxidation either dissolve in the slag or escape as gaseous phase.

40|$|Abstract. Diffusion {{phenomena}} are {{of great}} importance in materials processing wherein atomic, molecular or ionic species are distributed within a phase or among different phases. Though the phenomenological equation describing the diffusion phenomena including the bulk flow arising out of diffusion in fluid and the phenomena of Kirkendall shift in substitutional solids are the same, these processes are often treated independently. Some discussion on this aspect {{is presented in the}} theoretical aspects of diffusion. Owing to the complexity of atomic interactions, prediction of diffusion coefficients in condensed systems from first principles may not be that reliable; Experimental determination of diffusion coefficients is essential. In the second section, some novel experimental techniques developed recently to measure diffusion coefficients in the solid state as well as liquid systems including those in slags are described.

40|$|Central to the {{practice}} of chemical <b>process</b> <b>metallurgy</b> and materials engineering is control of the transfer between and reorganisation of chemical species into different phases. These heterogeneous processes between gas, liquid and solid phases involve reactions occurring across and at interfaces. The driving force for these changes is in all cases the Gibbs free energy change that will occur on moving to a new state, which is a function of temperature, bulk composition of the system and the compositions of the reactant and product phases. The condition for spontaneous change is a decrease in the Gibbs free energy of the Universe. In general we expect that the greater the difference in the initial and final states the faster the reactions will proceed.

As in the case of other mature technologies, the emphasis has shifted from very fundamental studies towards the development of mathematical models that allow both optimisation of the process that may be incorporated into process control. In particular, over the last three decades, thermodynamic models have been developed and used extensively to predict the outcome of reactions and design process conditions. There still significant issues around the predicting the chemical behaviour of slags but a number of advanced models have been developed around the world. Computational fluid dynamics has also been rapidly successfully employed in studying a wide range of pyrometallurgical processes, however, there are still significant challenges associated with coupling these models with chemical and interfacial interactions. In general, no general computational approach to modelling process kinetics has emerged and there important challenges associated with capturing transient chemical and physical behaviour, and area of great interest to the authors who have developed various transient kinetics models.
