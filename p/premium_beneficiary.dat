40|$|The Less Favoured Areas (LFAs) Directive (75 / 268) {{which was}} {{introduced}} in 1975, was the first common European instrument of regional agricultural structural policy. LFAs are areas where agriculture is hampered by permanent natural handicaps. The major objectives were to ensure the continuation of farming, thereby maintaining a minimum population level and preserving scenic landscapes and environmentally valuable habitats. In the Netherlands, the LFA measure is used as an additional payment, to compensate farmers for negative economic effects due to the conservation of these natural handicaps. It was not implemented as a stand alone policy, but is linked to measures aiming at active nature and landscape conservation management. In this paper, the effects will be examined of the regulations aiming at the conservation of natural handicaps on farm businesses within LFAs, when comparing them to farm businesses outside LFAs, where these regulations and handicaps do not exist. The main data source that was used is the Farm Accountancy Data Network. Reference groups of farms were compiled {{with the use of}} the simple and multiple imputation approach in Stars (Statistics for Regional Studies). Both analyses were tested with the use of a parametric and a nonparametric test. When comparing the results of both analyses, it can be concluded that there is no evidence that there is a statistical difference in family farm income corrected for and not corrected for LFA payment between the LFA farm businesses and the reference groups. Based on these findings it can be concluded that the size of the compensatory allowances is small and there is no evidence that it has a significant effect on the family farm income of LFA farm businesses. The main purpose of the Dutch LFA policy is to compensate farm businesses for negative economic effects due to the conservation of natural handicaps. Although this may be true for some individual farms, based on the methods used in this paper, it appears not to be the case for the collectivity of LFA <b>premium</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> as a whole.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In 2006, the federal government spent about $ 59 billion on Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, {{an alternative to the}} original Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) program. Although health plans were originally envisioned in the 1980 s as a potential source of Medicare savings, such plans have generally increased program spending. Payments to MA plans have been estimated to be 12 percent greater than what Medicare would have spent in 2006 had MA beneficiaries been enrolled in Medicare FFS. Some policymakers are concerned about the cost of the MA program and its contribution to overall spending on the Medicare program, which already faces serious long-term financial challenges. MA plans receive a per member per month (PMPM) payment to provide services covered under Medicare FFS. Almost all MA plans receive an additional Medicare payment, known as a rebate. Plans use rebates and sometimes additional <b>beneficiary</b> <b>premiums</b> to fund benefits not covered under Medicare FFS, reduce <b>premiums,</b> or reduce <b>beneficiary</b> cost sharing. This report examines for 2007 (1) MA plans' projected rebate allocations; (2) additional benefits MA plans commonly covered and their costs; (3) MA plans' projected cost sharing; and (4) MA plans' allocation of projected revenues and expenses. GAO analyzed data on MA plans' projected revenues and covered benefits for the most common types of MA plans, accounting for 71 percent of all beneficiaries in MA plans. ...|$|R

25|$|Medicare was {{established}} in 1965 and expanded thereafter. Spending for Medicare during 2016 was $692 billion, versus $634 billion in 2014, an increase of $58 billion or 9%. In 2013, the program covered an estimated 52.3 million persons. It consists of four distinct parts which are funded differently: Hospital Insurance, mainly funded by a dedicated payroll tax of 2.9% of earnings, shared equally between employers and workers; Supplementary Medical Insurance, funded through <b>beneficiary</b> <b>premiums</b> (set at 25% of estimated program costs for the aged) and general revenues (the remaining amount, approximately 75%); Medicare Advantage, a private plan option for beneficiaries, funded through the Hospital Insurance and Supplementary Medical Insurance trust funds; and the Part D prescription drug benefits, for which funding {{is included in the}} Supplementary Medical Insurance trust fund and is financed through <b>beneficiary</b> <b>premiums</b> (about 25%) and general revenues (about 75%). Spending on Medicare and Medicaid is projected to grow dramatically in coming decades. The number of persons enrolled in Medicare is expected to increase from 47 million in 2010 to 80 million by 2030. While the same demographic trends that affect Social Security also affect Medicare, rapidly rising medical prices appear to be a more important cause of projected spending increases. CBO expects Medicare and Medicaid to continue growing, rising from 5.3% GDP in 2009 to 10.0% in 2035 and 19.0% by 2082. CBO has indicated healthcare spending per beneficiary is the primary long-term fiscal challenge. Various reform strategies were proposed for healthcare, and in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted as a means of health care reform. CBO reduced its per capita Medicare spending assumptions by $1,000 for 2014 and $2,300 for 2019, relative to its 2010 estimate for those years. If this trend continues, it will significantly improve the long-term budget outlook.|$|R

40|$|Disabilities Through Quality Benefits Planning Services Vol. 1, Number 1 July, 2003 Medicare is our country's health {{insurance}} program for people age 65 or older, certain peo-ple with disabilities who are under age 65 and people of any age who have permanent kid-ney failure. It provides basic protection against {{the cost of health}} care, but it doesn't cover all medical expenses or the cost of most long-term care. The Medicare program is financed by a portion of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes paid by workers and their employers. It also is financed in part by monthly <b>premiums</b> paid by <b>beneficiaries.</b> The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services or CMS (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration or HCFA) is the federal agency in charge of the Medicare program. However, the Social Security Administration determines who is eligible for Medicare, enrolls people in the program, and disseminates general Medicare information. There are two parts of Medicare. Medicare "Part A " which is also known as Hospital Insurance or HI helps pay for care in a hospital and skilled nursing facility, home health care and hospice care. Medicare "Part B " which is also known as supplemental medical insurance or SMI helps pay for doctors, outpatient hospital care and other medical services.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Social Security Administration (SSA) has been withholding Medicare premiums from beneficiaries' Social Security payments since the Supplementary Medical Insurance (Part B) program was first enacted in 1965. Beginning in 2006, premium withholding became a payment option for the Medicare Advantage program (Part C) and the new program for Prescription Drug Coverage (Part D). These changes were authorized by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). Two federal agencies play critical roles in the premium withholding process: the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and SSA. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) also {{plays an important role}} by disbursing the adjusted Social Security payments to <b>beneficiaries.</b> <b>Premium</b> withholding can make paying premiums easier for both beneficiaries and the insurance plans. However, following implementation of the premium withholding provisions under MMA in 2006, there were numerous reports of beneficiaries not having the correct Parts C and D premiums withheld. Also, about 231, 000 <b>beneficiaries</b> had their <b>premiums</b> refunded erroneously because they were mistakenly identified as having paid excess premiums. As a result, you requested that we review efforts to ensure that the correct Medicare premiums are being withheld from beneficiaries' Social Security payments. Specifically, we sought answers to the following key questions: 1. How do the processes for withholding premiums from Social Security payments compare for the various parts of Medicare? 2. What problems, if any, have been identified with the premium withholding process? 3. What steps have SSA and CMS taken to address these problems?...|$|R
40|$|Medicare {{pays for}} {{at least half of}} the {{hospital}} and medical expenses incurred by America 2 ̆ 7 s elderly and disabled. It is also periodically the object of intense political debate, marked by exaggerated claims about how the sky will fall unless some fundamental change is made in the financing, benefits, or administration of the program. Over the past decade and a half, this political attention has had less and less to do with legitimate concerns about budget deficits and Medicare 2 ̆ 7 s real (if usually overstated) faults. Instead, it has become principally fueled by the alarmist rhetoric of those who ideologically oppose Medicare 2 ̆ 7 s social insurance structure. Most of these critics, mindful of Medicare 2 ̆ 7 s broad popularity, mask their underlying hostility to the program with a veneer of public-minded concern. Unfortunately, their rhetoric of crisis clouds more than it illuminates what is fundamentally at issue in all these disputes. In this Essay, we concentrate on one such confused aspect of the recent debate that is emblematic of the contemporary politics of Medicare: the debate over 2 ̆ 2 means-testing 2 ̆ 2 Part B of Medicare, the medical insurance program. In a significant break with Medicare 2 ̆ 7 s history, the reform legislation of 2003 - the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) - imposes sharply higher <b>premiums</b> on wealthy <b>beneficiaries.</b> The story of how this came to pass has been largely lost in the crowded pages of American journalism. But at least one journalist noted that 2 ̆ 2 House and Senate negotiators, struggling for accord on a plan to redesign Medicare, have agreed in principle that wealthy older Americans should pay more for doctor visits and other outpatient care, reprising an idea that has proved politically explosive. 2 ̆ 2 The income or means-testing dispute was just one small part of the larger struggle over the shape of the prescription drug benefit that President George W. Bush signed into law in early December 2003. Yet the dispute was symbolic of the confusion that surrounds the questions of whether and how Medicare ought to be restructured...|$|R
