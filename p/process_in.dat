5|$|Markov {{processes}} are stochastic processes, traditionally in discrete or continuous time, {{that have the}} Markov property, which means the next value of the Markov process depends on the current value, but it is conditionally independent of the previous values of the stochastic <b>process.</b> <b>In</b> other words, {{the behavior of the}} <b>process</b> <b>in</b> the future is stochastically independent of its behavior in the past, given {{the current state of the}} process.|$|E
5|$|The chewing of cud by {{animals such as}} cows, goats, and giraffes is {{considered}} normal behavior. These animals are known as ruminants. Such behavior, though termed rumination, {{is not related to}} human rumination syndrome, but is ordinary. Involuntary rumination, similar to what is seen in humans, has been described in gorillas and other primates. True merycism, as opposed to the cud-chewing <b>process</b> <b>in</b> ruminants, is also a normal part of the digestive <b>process</b> <b>in</b> some other animals, such as kangaroos.|$|E

They improved their final record from the previous season by one game, and again finished tenth in the Western Conference, three games out of the playoffs. Their attendance declined slightly compared to the previous season, and they finished 15th overall in attendance.|$|E
