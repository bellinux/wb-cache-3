5|$|A new <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> {{has been}} {{constructed}} on college-owned land between Sullivan Arena and privately owned Clarke Farm in Bedford. This <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> {{has replaced the}} former Joan of Arc <b>parking</b> <b>lot,</b> which was located between the Dana Center, Davison Dining Hall, and the Joan of Arc dormitory (JOA). The former <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> was torn down, and a grassy open quadrangle was constructed {{during the summer of}} 2012. A grotto has been built between JOA and Gadbois Hall and was dedicated in late 2014, with the placement of a religious statue. The quadrangle is yet to be named, and has new lights and walkways; the centerpiece is a large granite seal of the college. The project is the first place on campus where electronic gates have been installed. The gates are used to cordon off the roads of the new quad during the regular semester and can be opened for emergency vehicles and during move in/out days.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Recent {{studies of}} public {{underground}} <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> showed {{the influence of}} radon concentration and the probable discomfort caused by parking cars. Materials and Methods Radon concentration was measured in semi-closed public <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> in the six governorates of Kuwait, using Durridge RAD 7 radon detector (USA). Results The peak radon concentration in the <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> of Kuwait governorates was relatively higher during winter (63. 15 Bq/m 3) compared to summer (41. 73 Bq/m 3). Radon in the evaluated <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> revealed a mean annual absorbed dose (DRn: 0. 02 mSv/y) and annual effective dose (HE: 0. 06 mSv/y).   Conclusion This study validated the influence of relative humidity and temperature as the major components of discomfort index (DI). The mean annual absorbed and effective dose  of radon in the evaluated <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> were found below the permissible limits. However, high radon DRn and HE were reported when the assessment included the <b>parking</b> <b>lots,</b> the surrounding residential apartments, and office premises. Furthermore, the time-series analysis indicated significant variations of the seasonal and site-wise distribution of radon concentrations in the indoor evaluated <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> of the six Kuwait governorate...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{feasibility}} of ALPR technology in Canada, a pilot project using the technology was conducted in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada in 2006. As part of this larger pilot project, one unmarked police vehicle equipped with ALPR technology was deployed {{to a number of}} major <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> in Surrey. The purpose of this current {{study was to examine the}} data from this one car to analyze the quantity, quality, and location of „hits‟ to determine whether it was a viable and useful strategy to deploy ALPR-enabled police vehicles to <b>parking</b> <b>lots.</b> Given the proportion of „hits‟ in <b>parking</b> <b>lots,</b> it is recommended that ALPR not be deployed to <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> alone. While there may be a benefit to deploying ALPR-enabled vehicles to <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> between 3 p. m. and 7 p. m., it would appear that the technology might be more useful along high traffic corridors...|$|R
