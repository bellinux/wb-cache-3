25|$|Collocation of a waste {{generator}} with a waste-to-ethanol plant {{can reduce the}} waste producer's operating cost, while creating a more-profitable ethanol production business. This innovative collocation concept is sometimes called holistic systems engineering. Collocation disposal elimination {{may be one of}} the few cost-effective, environmentally sound, biofuel strategies, but its scalability is limited by availability of appropriate waste generation sources. For example, millions of tons of wet Florida-and-California citrus peels cannot supply billions of gallons of biofuels.

First, he analyzes food once more, this time from an ecological perspective, and again claims that most food products are not threatened by human growth. An exception, however, is fish, which continues to be depleted. As a <b>partial</b> <b>solution,</b> Lomborg presents fish farms, which cause a less disruptive impact on the world's oceans. Next, Lomborg looks at forests. He finds no indication of widespread deforestation, and notes that even the Amazon still retains more than 80% of its 1978 tree cover. Lomborg points out that in developing countries, deforestation is linked to poverty and poor economic conditions, so he proposes that economic growth is the best means to tackle the loss of forests.|$|E

TwigStack [2] is a holistic twig join algorithm that solves the problem in two steps: (1) finding potentially useful intermediate path solutions, (2) merging the intermediate solutions. The algorithm is optimal when the twig pattern has only //-edges, in the sense that no useless <b>partial</b> <b>solutions</b> are generated in the first step (thus expediting the second step and boosting the overall performance). However, when /-edges are present, a large set of useless <b>partial</b> <b>solutions</b> may be produced, which directly downgrades the overall performance. Recently, some improved versions of the algorithm (e. g., TwigStackList and iTwigJoin) have been proposed in an attempt {{to reduce the number of}} useless <b>partial</b> <b>solutions</b> when /-edges are involved. However, none of the algorithms can avoid useless <b>partial</b> <b>solutions</b> completely. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, TwigBuffer, that is guaranteed to completely avoid the useless <b>partial</b> <b>solutions.</b> Our algorithm is based on a novel strategy to buffer and manipulate elements in stacks and lists.

Berthold effected a wholesale exchange of Jasta 18 people and aircraft into Jagdstaffel 15 in the wing. Jasta 15 became the wing's Stab Staffel (command squadron). Berthold then departed for Buddecke's funeral in Berlin on 22 March to give a eulogy. He returned to his new assignment two days into the new German offensive, to find that the infantry divisions his wing was supposed to support were complaining about their lack of air cover.

500|$|A {{part of a}} solver {{for full}} nonogram puzzles, [...] used 2-satisfiability to combine {{information}} obtained from several other heuristics. Given a <b>partial</b> <b>solution</b> to the puzzle, they use dynamic programming within each row or column {{to determine whether the}} constraints of that row or column force any of its squares to be white or black, and whether any two squares in the same row or column can be connected by an implication relation. They also transform the nonogram into a digital tomography problem by replacing the sequence of block lengths in each row and column by its sum, and use a maximum flow formulation to determine whether this digital tomography problem combining all of the rows and columns has any squares whose state can be determined or pairs of squares that can be connected by an implication relation. If either of these two heuristics determines the value of one of the squares, it is included in the <b>partial</b> <b>solution</b> and the same calculations are repeated. However, if both heuristics fail to set any squares, the implications found by both of them are combined into a 2-satisfiability problem and a 2-satisfiability solver is used to find squares whose value is fixed by the problem, after which the procedure is again repeated. This procedure may or may not succeed in finding a solution, but it is guaranteed to run in polynomial time. Batenburg and Kosters report that, although most newspaper puzzles do not need its full power, both this procedure and a more powerful but slower procedure which combines this 2-satisfiability approach with the limited backtracking of [...] are significantly more effective than the dynamic programming and flow heuristics without 2-satisfiability when applied to more difficult randomly generated nonograms.|$|E

In one algorithm, {{search is}} performed concurrently on disjoint {{parts of the}} global search space, by agents that constitute these parts. Agents form a hierarchy of groups and each group generates consistent <b>partial</b> <b>solutions.</b> <b>Partial</b> <b>solutions</b> are produced concurrently and are combined into consistent global solutions by agents that are higher in the hierarchy. In another algorithm, concurrent independent backtracking search processes grow partial assignments along a hierarchy of agent groups, with each agent participating in multiple search processes. Stochastic choices for the order of assigning agents are taken after backtracking, securing the growing partial assignments from stalling in local minima. The first part of both algorithms partitions the distributed constraint network into a binary tree of groups.
