40|$|Because of the {{evolution}} of herbicide-resistant weeds, such as barnyardgrass and red rice in rice, {{there is a need for}} alternative herbicide sites of action. Very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) -inhibiting herbicides are not labeled for use in U. S. rice production; however, this site of action (SOA) has been used with success in Asian rice. The VLCFA-inhibiting herbicides <b>pethoxamid,</b> pyroxasulfone, acetochlor, and S-metolachlor were evaluated for rice tolerance and control of commonly problematic weeds in Arkansas rice at various rates and application timings. Pyroxasulfone and S-metolachlor were deemed unfit for use in rice production because of negative effects on rice visual injury, rough rice yield, height, shoot density, and heading. <b>Pethoxamid</b> and acetochlor were used with little detriment to the rice crop when applied no earlier than the 1 -lf growth stage. Along with minimal rice injury, <b>pethoxamid</b> controlled barnyardgrass all season when used in a program with other common rice herbicides such as clomazone, imazethapyr, or quinclorac. Considering the minimal injury observed, <b>pethoxamid</b> and acetochlor should be considered for integration into U. S. rice production to represent a unique herbicide SOA to use in rotation, sequential application, or tank mixtures with other rice herbicides.

40|$|Summary The aim of {{the thesis}} was to find out as much {{information}} available about the smallflowered cranesbill (Geranium pusillum) as possible, which would contribute to the struggle against the poppy plant (Papaver somniferum). These information are: morphology, nutrition requirements, requirements for environment, vegetation period, seed formation, quantity of seed dispersal, germination and dormancy of seeds. Further aim was {{to find out which}} preparation shows effect on cranesbill diminutive and its potential phytotoxicity on poppy with emphasis on the pre-emergence herbicides which were used in the experiment. Five agents were used as separately or as combinations, namely: clomazone, <b>pethoxamid,</b> mesotrione, metezachlor and DMTA - P. Final aim was to determine which product and active agent is able to exterminate smallflowered cranesbill in other crops...|$|E
