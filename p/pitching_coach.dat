40|$|It is a {{commonly}} held perception amongst biomechanists, sports medicine practitioners, baseball coaches and players, {{that an individual}} baseball player's style of throwing or pitching influences their performance and susceptibility to injury. With {{the results of a}} series of focus groups with baseball managers and <b>pitching</b> <b>coaches</b> in mind, the available scientific literature was reviewed regarding the contribution of individual aspects of pitching and throwing mechanics to potential for injury and performance. After a discussion of the limitations of kinematic and kinetic analyses, the individual aspects of pitching mechanics are discussed under arbitrary headings: Foot position at stride foot contact; Elbow flexion; Arm rotation; Arm horizontal abduction; Arm abduction; Lead knee position; Pelvic orientation; Deceleration-phase related issues; Curveballs; and Teaching throwing mechanics. In general, popular opinion of baseball coaching staff was found to be largely in concordance with the scientific investigations of biomechanists with several notable exceptions. Some difficulties are identified with the practical implementation of analyzing throwing mechanics in the field by <b>pitching</b> <b>coaches,</b> and with some unquantified aspects of scientific analyse...|$|R

500|$|Strasburg's {{pitching}} mechanics drew concern {{early in}} his career from scouts and coaches.

Independent scout Paul Reddick compared his mechanics unfavorably with those of pitching legend Greg Maddux, saying Strasburg's motion was inefficient and badly synchronized.|$|R
5|$|In 1901, {{the rival}} American League {{declared}} major league status {{and set about}} raiding National League rosters. Young left St. Louis and joined the American League's Boston Americans for a $3,500 contract ($ today). Young would remain with the Boston team until 1909. In {{his first year in}} the American League, Young was dominant. Pitching to Criger, who had also jumped to Boston, Young led the league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA, thus earning the colloquial AL Triple Crown for pitchers. Young won almost 42% of his team's games in 1901, accounting for 33 of his team's 79 wins. In February 1902, {{before the start of the}} baseball season, Young served as a <b>pitching</b> <b>coach</b> at Harvard University.

5|$|Nashville {{ended the}} 2000 {{season with a}} 63–79 record, {{resulting}} in a last-place finish in the divisional standings.

The Sounds compiled a 64–77 record, leaving them in third-place. On June 30, Tike Redman became the first Sounds player to hit for the cycle. Redman also holds the Sounds franchise record for the most triples (30) during his career with the team. Despite finishing the 2002 season with a 72–71 record under Brown, it was only good enough for a third-place finish, two-and-a-half games out of first place. Chad Hermansen, who played for the Sounds from 1998 to 2002, holds three career franchise records: runs (303), home runs (92), and runs batted in (286).|$|E
5|$|Ruffing {{dropped out}} of school as a child to work in a coal mine in his native Illinois. He played for the mine's company {{baseball}} team as an outfielder and first baseman. After he lost four toes from his left foot in a mining accident, he became unable to run in the field, and switched to pitching. He played in minor league baseball in 1923 and 1924 before making his MLB debut with the Red Sox. After struggling with Boston, pitching to a 36–93 win–loss record, the Red Sox traded Ruffing to the Yankees, where he became successful, pitching as the Yankees' ace through 1946. After one season with the White Sox, Ruffing retired from pitching to work in coaching. He served as a bullpen coach for the White Sox, a <b>pitching</b> <b>coach</b> for the New York Mets, and a scout and minor league instructor for the Cleveland Indians.|$|E

25|$|Another {{major change}} {{that had been}} {{occurring}} during this time was {{the adoption of the}} pitch count. Starting pitchers playing complete games had not been an unusual thing in baseball's history. Now <b>pitching</b> <b>coaches</b> watched to see how many pitches a player had thrown over the game. At anywhere from 100 to 125, pitchers increasingly would be pulled out to preserve their arms. Bullpens began to specialize more, with more pitchers being trained as middle relievers, and a few hurlers, usually possessing high velocity but not much durability, as closers.|$|R
