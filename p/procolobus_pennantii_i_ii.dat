50|$|Pennant's colobus {{was first}} {{described}} in 1838 by George Robert Waterhouse, {{curator at the}} Zoological Society of London's museum, and was named in honour of the naturalist and traveller Thomas Pennant.Three subspecies of this red colobus are traditionally recognized: The Bioko red colobus (<b>Procolobus</b> <b>pennantii</b> pennantii), the Niger Delta red colobus (<b>Procolobus</b> <b>pennantii</b> epieni) and Bouvier's red colobus (<b>Procolobus</b> <b>pennantii</b> bouvieri). However, Groves (2007) raised P. p. epieni, and P. p. bouvieri to Piliocolobus epieni and Piliocolobus bouvieri, respectively (this nomenclature has been followed here). Ting agreed that preliminary genetic evidence supported elevating P. epieni at least.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the time}} it first became known to science (in 1993) until 2007 or 2008, it was {{considered}} a subspecies of the western red colobus (Procolobus badius) and more recently Pennant's colobus (<b>Procolobus</b> <b>pennantii),</b> and its trinomial name was Procolobus badius epieni or <b>Procolobus</b> <b>pennantii</b> epieni. Colin Groves recognized the Niger Delta red colobus as a full species in 2007, although Groves considered all the red colobus monkeys, including the Niger Delta red colobus {{to be in the}} genus Piliocolobus, rather than Procolobus (this nomenclature has been followed here). [...] However, other authors consider Piliocolobus to be a subgenus of Procolobus.|$|R
5000|$|The Ecological Constraint Model {{has been}} found to be {{supported}} in different primate species with a variety of diet, such as, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi), red colobus (<b>Procolobus</b> <b>pennantii),</b> red-tailed guenon (Cercopithecus ascanius), [...] and ursine colobus monkeys (Colobus vellerosus).|$|R
50|$|Bouvier's red colobus {{was first}} {{described}} in 1887 by Alphonse Trémeau de Rochebrune in Faune de Sénégambie. For many {{years it was}} considered a subspecies of Pennant's colobus and named <b>Procolobus</b> <b>pennantii</b> ssp. bouvieri. In 2007, Colin Groves reclassified it as a distinct species. Groves considers Piliocolobus to be a full genus, while other authors {{see it as a}} subgenus of Procolobus, and thus assigned Bouvier's red colobus the scientific name Piliocolobus bouvieri (this nomenclature has been followed here).|$|R
50|$|Pennant's colobus or Pennant's red colobus (<b>Procolobus</b> <b>pennantii)</b> is {{a species}} of tree-dwelling primate in the family Cercopithecidae. It is endemic to {{tropical}} Central Africa. Three subspecies have traditionally been recognised but its distribution is peculiarly disjunct and has been considered a biogeographical puzzle. with one population {{on the island of}} Bioko (Equatorial Guinea), a second in the Niger River Delta in southern Nigeria, and a third in east-central Republic of Congo. It is found in rainforests and marshy forests. It is threatened by habitat loss and hunting for bushmeat. One subspecies, bouvieri, is rated as Critically Endangered; although it was last photographically documented in 2015, it may be on the brink of extinction.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{processes}} of habitat loss and fragmentation {{are probably the}} most important threats to biodiversity. It is critical that we understand the conservation value of fragments, because they may represent opportunities to make important conservation gains, particularly for species whose ranges are not in a protected area. However, our ability to understand the value of fragments for primates is limited by the fact that researchers have conducted many studies in protected areas, which do not represent most fragments, and studies are typically short term. Here we determine the long-term survival probability of red (<b>Procolobus</b> <b>pennantii)</b> and black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza) inhabiting forest fragments outside of Kibale National Park, Uganda. Local communities use the fragments primarily for subsistence agriculture and fuelwood. We surveyed primate populations 3 times ove...|$|R
40|$|A goal of {{conservation}} biology {{is to determine}} which types of species are most susceptible to habitat disturbance and which types of disturbed habitats can support particular species. We studied 20 forest fragments outside of Kibale National Park, Uganda, to address this question. At each patch, we determined the presence of primate species, tree species composition, patch size, and distance to nearest patch. We collected demographic, behavioral, and dietary data for Abyssinian black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza). Black-and-white colobus and red-tailed guenons (Cercopithecus ascanius) were in almost all fragments; Pennant’s red colobus (<b>Procolobus</b> <b>pennantii)</b> and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) were in some fragments; and blue monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis) and gray-cheeked mangabeys (Lophocebus albigena) were absent from all fragments. No species characteristics—home range, body size, group size, or degree of frugivory—predicted the ability of species to live in patches. No characteristics of patches—area, distance to the nearest patch, distance to Kibale, or number of food trees present—predicted {{the presence of a}} particular species in a patch, but distance to Kibale may have influenced presence of red colobus. Black-and-white colobus group size was signifi-cantly smaller in the forest patches than in the continuous forest of Kibale. For a group of black-and-white colobus in one patch, food plant species and home range size were very different from those of a group within Kibale. However, their activity budget and plant parts eaten were quite {{similar to those of the}} Kibale group. The lack of strong predictive variables as well as differences between other studies of fragmentation and our...|$|R
