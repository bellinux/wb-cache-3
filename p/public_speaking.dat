As a result of this opportunity, he received training with the British Army, the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force, which he had, at a point, considered joining. However he missed the age cut-off by six months and was subsequently unable to join the programme. After he lost out on the place, he began teaching courses on <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> and personality development skills in Kolhapur and the satisfaction he gained through teaching, prompted him to pursue a post-graduation in <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> at Kishinchand Chellaram College in Mumbai. During the period, he also won the Indian Championship for <b>Public</b> <b>Speaking</b> and subsequently represented India at the Young Businessmen Conference in Tokyo, Japan in 1992.

40|$|The article emphasises that {{teachers}} {{as part of}} the educational process must have an insight into the definition of public speech performance as well as the knowledge of this field, which can also be the opportunity for their professional development. The definition of public speech performance can originate from the tenets of rhetoric, which considers it a <b>spoken</b> and <b>public</b> discourse. When defining the role of the speaker and the listener in contemporary <b>public</b> monological <b>spoken</b> communication and the purpose of <b>public</b> <b>spoken</b> monological discourses, the tenets of rhetoric have to be complemented by those of linguistics. Knowledge of the public/formal speech context, which is demanded from the teaching profession, is also important.
