40|$|A rapid high {{performance}} liquid chromatography (HPLC) method incorporating {{the use of}} an Aminex HPX- 87 H organic acid column was developed for the separation, identification and quantitative analysis of gluconic acid and other major acids in grape juice and wine. This method was used to investigate the effectiveness of deacidification treatments for removing gluconic acid from high acid grape juice and reduced alcohol wine produced by using a glucose oxidase-catalase (GOD/CAT) juice treatment. Müller Thurgau juice was subjected to a GOD/CAT treatment as a means of reducing the concentration of glucose in the grape juice before fermentation to produce a reduced alcohol wine. The enzyme is an aerobic dehydrogenase which catalyses the oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid. The juice was found to contain ~ 75 g/L gluconic acid, and when a portion of this was fermented to dryness and cold stabilised, the gluconic acid had reduced in concentration to ~ 45 g/L and the reduced alcohol wine contained 8. 3 % alcohol (v/v). The corresponding increase in acidity in both the reduced sugar juice and reduced alcohol wine had to be neutralised to present a palatable product. Three deacidification treatments were investigated in reduced alcohol wines and high acid grape juice and these included: neutralisation with CaCO₃ (calcium carbonate), seeding with gluconate salts and CaCO₃, and anion exchange with an Amberlite IRA- 93 resin. Both the neutralisation and seeding treatments produced disappointing results, with a significant but minimal decrease in gluconic, tartaric and malic acids. Even though the solutions analysed would have been saturated with <b>potassium</b> tartrate and <b>gluconate,</b> there was obviously a stable equilibrium in force, and the addition of seed crystals and chilling to ~ 2 °C had no effect. The anion exchange treatment showed considerable promise though, with reduction in all the three major organic acids. A new technique was investigated, which involved charging the resin with tartaric acid, and then passing the wine/juice through. The weaker gluconic acid in solution exchanged with the stronger tartaric acid. This technique has the potential to selectively remove gluconic acid. A hindrance to this technique is the removal of colour from the wine/juice due to the resin matrix. The effect of resins on colour and flavour warrants further investigation...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{identifies}} and characterizes a novel ATP-dependent bile-salt transport system in isolated canalicular rat liver plasma-membrane (cLPM) vesicles. ATP (1 - 5 mM) stimulated taurocholate uptake into cLPM vesicles between 6 - and 8 -fold above equilibrium uptake values (overshoot) and above values for incubations {{in the absence}} of ATP. The ATP-dependent portion of taurocholate uptake was 2 -fold higher in the presence of equilibrated KNO 3 as compared with <b>potassium</b> <b>gluconate,</b> indicating that the stimulatory effect of ATP was not due to the generation of an intravesicular positive membrane potential. Saturation kinetics revealed a very high affinity (Km approximately 2. 1 microM) of the system for taurocholate. The system could only minimally be stimulated by nucleotides other than ATP. Furthermore, it was preferentially inhibited by conjugated univalent bile salts. Further strong inhibitory effects were observed with valinomycin, oligomycin, 4, 4 '-di-isothiocyano- 2, 2 '-stilbene disulphonate, sulphobromophthalein, leukotriene C 4 and N-ethylmaleimide, whereas nigericin, vanadate, GSH, GSSG and daunomycin exerted only weak inhibitory effects or none at all. These results indicate the presence of a high-affinity primary ATP-dependent bile-salt transport system in cLPM vesicles.

40|$|Abstract: Fruits and {{vegetables}} are known to possess health benefits: indeed, they contain {{a large number of}} bioactive molecules with a positive impact on human health. Dietary proteins possess specific biological properties which make these components potential ingredients of functional or health-promoting foods. Many of these properties are attributed to physiologically-active peptides encrypted in protein molecules. Kissper, a 39 -residue peptide isolated from kiwi fruit (Actinidia deliciosa), derives from the processing of kiwellin, a well-represented novel allergenic protein present in the edible part of the fruit. Kissper has six cysteine residues forming three disulfide bridges. This cysteine pattern is similar, but not identical, to those observed in some plant and animal proteins, including toxins involved in defence mechanisms. We show that kissper forms ion channels in DOPS:DOPE:POPC PLMs in different media, such as KCl, <b>potassium</b> <b>gluconate,</b> potassium citrate and potassium phosphate monobasic. Kissper’s channels show a strong voltage dependence in all media used, and an estimated pore diameter in the range from 1. 9 to 7. 6 Å in KCl medium.

Therefore we propose the kissper as a novel nutraceutical component of kiwi fruit that may have a positive impact on human health due to its channel-like pathways which modulate membrane permeability. The kissper action might promote the adsorption of substances, in particular, within the gastrointestinal tract, helping digestion, preventing constipation and harmful accumulation of metabolites...|$|E

However, Cry 1 E, despite having a toxicity comparable to that of Cry 1 C, formed channels as efficiently as the Cry 1 A toxins at pH 10. 5.

None of the dairy control strains (i. e. L. lactis subsp. cremoris HP, L. lactis subsp. lactis IL 1403 and Lactococcus lactis 303) were able to utilize any of these carbohydrates. The technological potential of the isolates as flavour-producing lactococci was evaluated by analysing their growth in milk and their ability to produce volatile compounds using solid phase micro-extraction of the headspace coupled to gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (SPME GC–MS). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the volatile compounds clearly separated the dairy strains from the plant derived strains, with higher levels of most flavour rich compounds. The flavour compounds produced by the plant isolates among others included; fatty acids such as 2 - and 3 -methylbutanoic acids, and hexanoic acid, several esters (e. g. butyl acetate and ethyl butanoate) and ketones (e. g. acetoin, diacetyl and 2 -heptanone), all of which have been associated with desirable and more mature flavours in cheese.

The recent discovery of Panx 1 expression in the OE raises the question whether Panx 1 mediates ATP release responsible for modulating chemosensory function. In this study, we analyzed pannexin expression in the OE and a possible role of Panx 1 in olfactory function using a Panx 1 -/- mouse line with a global ablation of Panx 1. This mouse model has been previously used to investigate Panx 1 functions in the retina and adult hippocampus. Here, qPCR, in-situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) demonstrated that Panx 1 is expressed in axon bundles deriving from sensory neurons of the OE. The localization, distribution and expression of major olfactory signal transduction proteins were not significantly altered in Panx 1 -/- mice. Further, functional analysis of Panx 1 -/- animals does not reveal any major impairment in odor perception, indicated by electroolfactogram (EOG) measurements and behavioral testing. However, ATP release evoked by <b>potassium</b> <b>gluconate</b> application was reduced in Panx 1 -/- mice. This result is consistent with previous reports on ATP release in isolated erythrocytes and spinal or lumbar cord preparations from Panx 1 -/- mice, suggesting that Panx 1 is one of several alternative pathways to release ATP in the olfactory system...|$|E
40|$|Shilajit, a {{medicine}} herb {{commonly used in}} Ayurveda, {{has been reported to}} contain at least 85 minerals in ionic form that act on a variety of chemical, biological, and physical stressors. The substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons of the trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc) are involved in orofacial nociceptive processing. Shilajit has been reported to be an injury and muscular pain reliever but there have been few functional studies of the effect of Shilajit on the SG neurons of the Vc. Therefore, whole cell and gramicidin-perfotrated patch clamp studies were performed to examine the action mechanism of Shilajit on the SG neurons of Vc from mouse brainstem slices. In the whole cell patch clamp mode, Shilajit induced short-lived and repeatable inward currents under the condition of a high chloride pipette solution on all the SG neurons tested. The Shilajit-induced inward currents were concentration dependent and maintained in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), a voltage gated Na+ channel blocker, CNQX, a non-NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist, and AP 5, an NMDA receptor antagonist. The Shilajit-induced responses were partially suppressed by picrotoxin, a GABAA receptor antagonist, and totally blocked in the presence of strychnine, a glycine receptor antagonist, however not affected by mecamylamine hydrochloride (MCH), a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. Under the <b>potassium</b> <b>gluconate</b> pipette solution at holding potential 0 mV, Shilajit induced repeatable outward current. These results show that Shilajit has inhibitory effects on the SG neurons of Vc through chloride ion channels by activation of the glycine receptor and GABAA receptor, indicating that Shilajit contains sedating ingredients for the central nervous system. These results also suggest that Shilajit may be a potential target for modulating orofacial pain processing...|$|E

The major fatty acids (> 10  %) for PB 1 T are C 16  :  0 (19. 1  %), C 16  :  1 ω 7 cis (44. 6  %) and C 18  :  1 ω 7 cis (16. 2  %). The major polyamines are putrescine [54. 9 µmol (g dry weight) − 1] and 2 -hydroxy putrescine [18. 5 µmol (g dry weight) − 1]. DNA G+C content is 62. 5 mol%. Strain PB 1 T is phylogenetically related to species of the genus Herbaspirillum, with highest 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarities to Herbaspirillum canariense (97. 3  %), Herbaspirillum aurantiacum (97. 2  %), Herbaspirillum soli (97. 2  %) and Herbaspirillum frisingense (97. 0  %).

40|$|AbstractNonesterified {{long-chain}} {{fatty acids}} (myristic, palmitic, oleic and arachidonic), added at low amounts (around 20 nmol/mg protein) to rat liver mitochondria, energized by respiratory substrates and suspended in isotonic solutions of KCl, NaCl, RbCl or CsCl, adjusted to pH 8. 0, induce a large-scale swelling {{followed by a}} spontaneous contraction. Such swelling does not occur in alkaline solutions of choline chloride or <b>potassium</b> <b>gluconate</b> or sucrose. These changes in the matrix volume reflect a net uptake, followed by net extrusion, of KCl (or another alkali metal chloride) and are characterized by the following features: (1) Lowering of medium pH from 8. 0 to 7. 2 results in a disappearance of the swelling-contraction reaction. (2) The contraction phase disappears when the respiration is blocked by antimycin A. (3) Quinine, an inhibitor of the K+/H+ antiporter, does not affect swelling but suppresses the contraction phase. (4) The swelling phase {{is accompanied by a}} decrease of the transmembrane potential and an increase of respiration, whereas the contraction is followed by an increase of the membrane potential and a decrease of oxygen uptake. (5) Nigericin, a catalyst of the K+/H+ exchange, prevents or partly reverses the swelling and partly restores the depressed membrane potential. These results indicate that long-chain fatty acids activate in liver mitochondria suspended in alkaline saline media the uniporter of monovalent alkali metal cations, the K+/H+ antiporter and the inner membrane anion channel. These effects are presumably related to depletion of mitochondrial Mg 2 +, as reported previously [Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 403 (2002) 16], and are responsible for the energy-dissipating K+ cycling. The uniporter and the K+/H+ antiporter are in different ways activated by membrane stretching and/or unfolding, resulting in swelling followed by contraction...|$|E
40|$|CA 1 {{pyramidal}} neurons {{from animals}} that have acquired hippocampal tasks show increased neuronal excitability, {{as evidenced by}} {{a reduction in the}} postburst afterhyperpolarization (AHP). Studies of AHP plasticity require stable long-term recordings, which are affected by the intracellular solutions potassium methylsulphate (KMeth) or <b>potassium</b> <b>gluconate</b> (KGluc). Here we show immediate and gradual effects of these intracellular solutions on measurement of the AHP and basic membrane properties, and on the induction of AHP plasticity in CA 1 pyramidal neurons from rat hippocampal slices. The AHP measured immediately after establishing whole-cell recordings was larger with KMeth than with KGluc. In general, the AHP in KMeth was comparable to the AHP measured in the perforated-patch configuration. However, KMeth induced time-dependent changes in the intrinsic membrane properties of CA 1 pyramidal neurons. Specifically, input resistance progressively increased by 70 % after 50 min; correspondingly, the current required to trigger an action potential and the fast afterdepolarization following action potentials gradually decreased by about 50 %. Conversely, these measures were stable in KGluc. We also demonstrate that activity-dependent plasticity of the AHP occurs with physiologically relevant stimuli in KGluc. AHPs triggered with theta-burst firing every 30 s were progressively reduced, whereas AHPs elicited every 150 s were stable. Blockade of the apamin-sensitive AHP current (IAHP) was insufficient to block AHP plasticity, suggesting that plasticity is manifested through changes in the apamin-insensitive slow AHP current (sIAHP). These changes were observed in the presence of synaptic blockers, and therefore reflect changes in the intrinsic properties of the neurons. However, no AHP plasticity was observed using KMeth. In summary, these data show that KMeth produces time-dependent changes in basic membrane properties and prevents or obscures activity-dependent reduction of the AHP. In whole-cell recordings using KGluc, repetitive theta-burst firing induced AHP plasticity that mimics learning-related reduction in the AHP...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSarcoplasmic {{reticulum}} (SR) K+ channels from canine diaphragm {{were studied}} upon fusion of longitudinal and junctional membrane vesicles into planar lipid bilayers (PLB). The large-conductance cation selective channel (γmax = 250 pS; Km = 33 mM) displays long-lasting open events which {{are much more}} frequent at positive than at negative voltages. A major subconducting state about 45 % of the fully-open state current amplitude was occasionally observed at all voltages. The voltage-dependence of the open probability displays a sigmoid relationship that was fitted by the Boltzmann equation and {{expressed in terms of}} thermodynamic parameters, namely the free energy (ΔGi) and the effective gating charge (Zs) : ΔGi = 0. 27 kcal/mol andZs = − 1. 19 in 250 mM <b>potassium</b> <b>gluconate</b> (K-gluconate). Kinetic analyses also confirmed the voltage-dependent gating behavior of this channel, and indicate the implication of at least two open and three closed states. The diaphragm SR K+ channel shares several biophysical properties with the cardiac isoform: g = 180 pS, ΔGi = 0. 75 kcal/mol, Zs = − 1. 45 in 150 mM K-gluconate, and a similar sigmoid Po/voltage relationship. Little is known about the regulation of the diaphragm and cardiac SR K+ channels. The conductance and gating of these channels were not influenced by physiological concentrations of Ca 2 + (0. 1 μM– 1 mM) or Mg 2 + (0. 25 – 1 mM) as well as by cGMP (25 – 100 μM), lemakalim (1 – 100 μM), glyburide (up to 10 μM) or charybdotoxin (45 – 200 nM), added either to the cis or to the trans chamber. The apparent lack of biochemical or pharmacological modulation of these channels implies that they are not related to any of the well characterized surface membrane K+ channels. On the other hand, their voltage sensitivity strongly suggests that their activity could be modulated by putative changes in SR membrane potential that might occur during calcium fluxes...|$|E
40|$|Significantly more Ca(2 +) influx is {{required}} for eliciting release of neurotransmitter during whole cell patch clamp recording in the Calyx of Held, when gluconate with 3 mm free ATP is used as pipette filling solution, as compared to a methanesulfonate-based solution with excess Mg(2 +). This reduction in efficiency of Ca(2 +) in eliciting release is due to low-affinity Ca(2 +) binding of both gluconate and ATP(2 -) anions. To study these effects we developed a simple fluorimeteric titration procedure, which reports the dissociation constant, KD, of a given Ca(2 +) indicator dye, multiplied by 1 plus the sum of Ca(2 +) binding ratios of any anions, which act as low-affinity Ca(2 +) ligands. For solutions without Ca(2 +) binding anions we find KD values for Fura 2 FF ranging from 11. 5 ± 1. 7 to 15. 6 ± 7. 47 mum depending on the dominant anion used. For Fura 6 F and KCl-based solutions we find KD= 17. 8 ± 1. 3 mum. For solutions with gluconate as the main anion and for solutions that contain nucleotides, such as ATP and GTP, we find much higher values for the product. Assuming that the KD of the indicator dye is {{equal to that of}} KCl-based solutions we calculate the summed Ca(2 +) binding ratios and find a value of 3. 55 for a solution containing 100 mm <b>potassium</b> <b>gluconate</b> and 4 mm ATP. Gluconate contributes a value of 1. 75 to this number, while the contribution of ATP depends strongly on the presence of Mg(2 +) and varies from 0. 8 (with excess Mg(2 +)) to 13. 8 (in the presence of 3 mm free ATP). Methanesulfonate has negligible Ca(2 +) binding capacity. These results explain the reduced efficiency of Ca(2 +) influx in the presence of gluconate or nucleotides, as these anions are expected to intercept Ca(2 +) ions at short distance...|$|E
