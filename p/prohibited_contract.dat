50|$|The airline was {{established}} in March 2002 and started operations in October 2002. It was the launch customer for the Bombardier CRJ-900. The airline was started so that Mesa Air Group could fulfill its contractual obligations to operate the CRJ-900 as America West Express for America West Airlines. Establishing Freedom was necessary as Mesa Airlines was also operating as US Airways Express under a code share agreement for US Airways. US Airways' collective bargaining agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association <b>prohibited</b> <b>contract</b> carrier code share arrangements with regional jet carriers, if that carrier operated aircraft with more than 70 seats. Mesa Airlines, therefore, could not operate as US Airways Express and operate the CRJ-900.|$|E

Summary of Legislative Analyst 2 ̆ 7 s Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact: Unknown impact on {{state and local government}} costs to obtain construction-related services.

50|$|FieldCraft is {{economically}} rationalised, {{meaning that}} material capital expenditure {{is limited to}} existing funds already raised from profits accumulated after the deduction of applicable costs. This policy extends to <b>prohibit</b> <b>contracting</b> of ongoing services whose charges are not strictly activity based. By way of example, PayPal's merchant fees are strictly transaction based, whereas most Australian banks charge a number of fees on merchant accounts {{that have nothing to}} do with account activity - as a result, PayPal provides the merchant facilities for FieldCraft and not the banks. This kind of policy allows a business to idle during quiet times without incurring debt and makes for a very robust business model.|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, the {{district}} court declined to dismiss the suit, ruling that California law <b>prohibits</b> <b>contracts</b> that unfairly exculpate one party from its wrongdoing, such as clauses that do not allow class action lawsuits alleging fraud in consumer adhesion contracts where the individual damages are small. AT&T appealed the case, saying that the Federal Arbitration Act should preempt state law. On October 27, 2009, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court decision. AT&T, represented by Andrew J. Pincus of Mayer Brown, then appealed to the Supreme Court.

2500|$|Businesses {{targeted}} by class actions for inflicting massive aggregate harm have sought {{ways to avoid}} class actions altogether. In the 1990s, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a number of decisions which strengthened the [...] "federal policy favoring arbitration". In response, lawyers have added provisions to consumer contracts of adhesion called [...] "collective action waivers", which prohibit those signing the contracts from bringing class action suits. In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 5–4 decision in AT Mobility v. Concepcion that the Federal Arbitration Act of 1925 preempts state laws that <b>prohibit</b> <b>contracts</b> from disallowing class action lawsuits, which will {{make it more difficult}} for consumers to file class action lawsuits. The dissent pointed to a saving clause in the federal act which allowed states to determine how a contract or its clauses may be revoked.|$|R
50|$|A {{great variety}} of {{statutes}} have been enacted in the various states relating to the labour contract. Among these are laws defining the labour contract, requiring notice of termination of contract, making it a misdemeanour to break a contract of service and thereby endanger human life or expose valuable property to serious injury, or {{to make a contract}} of service and accept transportation or pecuniary advancements with intent to defraud, <b>prohibiting</b> <b>contracts</b> of employment whereby employees waive the right to damages in case of injury, &c. A Federal statute makes it a misdemeanour for any one to prepay the transportation or in any way assist or encourage the importation of aliens under contract to perform labour or service of any kind in the United States, exceptions being made in the case of skilled labour that cannot otherwise be obtained, domestic servants and persons belonging to any of the recognized professions.|$|R

He won his seat easily, becoming, after Arthur Shores (who had been appointed to a vacant seat by Mayor George Siebels in 1968), the second African American {{to serve on the}} council. After two years of quiet service, he introduced an ordinance requiring city departments to formulate hiring plans that included affirmative action goals and to contract business to companies that hired minorities. With opposition in the business community, the latter action failed, but the departmental hiring ordinance made it out of council to be vetoed by Siebels. Revised proposals that established recruitment programs and <b>prohibited</b> <b>contracting</b> with openly discriminatory firms, were later passed. His next major controversy was to push for a formal investigation of the shooting of an African American suspect while he was under police custody. The hearing was inconclusive, but opened the door to a more serious look at police procedure.|$|R

Also that same day, he vetoed SB 906, which would specify that no priest, minister, rabbi, or authorized person of any religious denomination would be required to solemnize a marriage that is contrary to the tenets of his or her faith. The bill would state that any refusal to solemnize a marriage under that provision shall not affect the tax exempt status of any entity.|$|R
