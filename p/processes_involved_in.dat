5|$|A {{primitive}} nervous system, without centralization, coordinates the <b>processes</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> maintaining homeostasis, {{as well as}} biochemical {{and physical}} responses to various stimuli. There are two nerve nets, one in the epidermis {{and one in the}} gastrodermis; these unite at the pharynx, the junctions of the septa with the oral disc and the pedal disc, and across the mesogloea. No specialized sense organs are present but sensory cells include nematocytes and chemoreceptors.|$|E

5|$|Many {{cases of}} {{poliomyelitis}} result in only temporary paralysis. Nerve impulses {{return to the}} formerly paralyzed muscle within a month, and recovery is usually complete in six to eight months. The neurophysiological <b>processes</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> recovery following acute paralytic poliomyelitis are quite effective; muscles are able to retain normal strength even if half the original motor neurons have been lost. Paralysis remaining after one year {{is likely to be}} permanent, although modest recoveries of muscle strength are possible 12 to 18 months after infection.|$|E
5|$|As silk was {{a luxury}} good, {{the market was}} small and easily {{saturated}} by machine produced goods. The next innovation in machine produced textiles came in the cotton industry which had a much wider market and produced more affordable goods. Spinning cotton was a more complex process than silk production. The water frame for spinning cotton was developed by Richard Arkwright and patented in 1769. The machines could spin yarn continuously and replaced skilled workers with unskilled supervisors {{to make sure the}} machines didn't break. Water frames varied in size from 4 to 96spindles. For these reasons, the water frame became popular and widespread. In 1771, Richard Arkwright took a lease on land in Cromford. By 1774, his first mill was operational, and in 1776 he began construction of a second mill at Cromford. During this time, he developed machines for pre-spinning and in 1775 took out his second patent. With spinning mechanised, the other <b>processes</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> producing cotton could not keep up and also required mechanisation. He produced a machine for carding, the process which laid out the cotton fibres parallel, however not all his inventions were successful and cleaning the cotton was performed by hand until the 1790s when an effective machine was invented.|$|E
