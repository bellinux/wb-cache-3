5000|$|Direct {{interaction}} of diseases {{occurs in the}} case of genetic recombination among different pathogens, for instance between Avian sarcoma leukosis virus and Marek's disease virus (MDV) in domestic fowl. Both cancer-causing viruses are known to infect the same <b>poultry</b> <b>flock,</b> the same chicken, and, even the same anatomic cell. In coinfected cells, the retroviral DNA of the avian leukosis virus can integrate into the MDV genome, producing altered biological properties compared to those of the parental MDV.

Through prayer and the help of many friends, he paid the outstanding debt within six years. He repaired and painted the older buildings, fireproofed the roofs, sod the campus with grass, planted gardens and orchards, and built a <b>poultry</b> <b>flock</b> and a dairy herd.

The West Campus Urban Farm was established in 2012 on a 0.5 acre plot, and is gradually expanding its management to include agroforestry practices on adjacent land. The agricultural areas of both teaching farms are stewarded to meet or exceed the standards required for organic certification, though neither farm has been formally certified. Both farms specialize in intensive mixed vegetable production using many of the practices popularized by growers such as Eliot Coleman and Jean-Martin Fortier. Harvests from the farm are sold by students at the Wooster Square Saturday farmers market, to New Haven restaurants, and are used as ingredients for special campus events in partnership with Yale Dining. Both farms feature perennial agroforestry areas, orchards, and honeybee hives.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} global {{concern over the}} newly emergent H 5 N 1 strain of avian influenza that has affected millions of domestic <b>poultry</b> <b>flocks</b> and resulted in 256 human cases and 152 deaths in humans. There has been little analysis of the general assumption that smallholder backyard <b>poultry</b> <b>flocks</b> are inherently at higher risk of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) than confined and commercial scale operations. We utilized data from Thailand, collected in 2004, to test the relative risks of HPAI infection in <b>poultry</b> <b>flocks,</b> by species, type of operation, and geographic location. The results indicate that backyard flocks are at significantly lower risk of HPAI infection compared to commercial scale operations of broiler or layer chickens or quail. These results are plausible {{in terms of the}} opportunities for breach of bio-security in commercial scale operations. Both experimental and observational studies in developed country settings have demonstrated the capacity of microbes to enter and leave these larger operations despite the implementation of standard bio-security measures.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{technical}} possibilities to improve free-range and backyard poultry keeping. Rural households, however, are not adopting these technologies widely. This paper presents a model approach for {{ex ante evaluation}} of interventions in village poultry systems. The dynamic deterministic computer model considers mortality, egg production, reproduction, offtake, and their interrelationships. In the base situation, the model reflects the behaviour of a relatively stable village <b>poultry</b> <b>flock.</b> The model was used to explore how interventions influence the dynamics of a village <b>poultry</b> <b>flock.</b> Over the simulated period of three years, NCD (Newcastle Disease) vaccination, daytime housing, supplementary feeding, and control of broodiness each had {{a positive effect on}} bird offtake, egg production, egg offtake, and flock size. Crossbreeding had a highly negative effect on these key variables. The impact of interventions is also related {{to the use of the}} available resources. Cost¿benefit calculations for the Tigray region in Ethiopia and village poultry research sites in Kenya indicated that NCD vaccinations were economically most effective. Housing and crossbreeding had a highly negative impact on net returns. When applied with situation-specific input data, the model can be used in the first stages of research and development approaches to support decisions on priorities of projects in village poultry production...|$|E
