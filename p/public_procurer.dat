40|$|Scholars' {{criticism}} of transparency in public-private partnerships (PPPs) often focuses on ‘external’ transparency, that is, {{the extent to}} which internal information is visible to the outside world. However, to achieve external transparency, internal transparency - the availability and inferability of information for the <b>public</b> <b>procurer</b> and the private party - is crucial. In this article we analyse input, process, and output transparency from three different perspectives (institutional, cognitive, and strategic) in four PPPs in the Netherlands. We conclude that[*]input transparency is high, but process and output transparency less so. Moreover, output transparency has gained importance in PPPs. Whether this is problematic depends on the PPPs' institutional environment. In some partnerships the desired output is uncontested and predetermined by clear standards in the institutional environment, whereas other PPPs deal with contested output norms, decreasing the partnerships' transparency. These results nuance the current debate on the lack of transparency in PPPs...|$|E
40|$|Public {{procurement}} {{of creative}} services {{is a complex}} area that is highly debated within the industry. Each year public organisations in Sweden procure goods and services worth SEK 600 billion, equal to one fifth of the Swedish GDP (Konkurrensverket, 2014 a: 17). By seeking out and taking advantage of competition in relevant markets, adherents of ‘New Public Management’ (NPM) argue that public funds {{be used in the}} best way. In public procurements, the tenderers are graded on different quality aspects and price. This is done in order for the contracting authority to compare the tenders and to preserve objectivity as required by law. However, when procuring creative services, quality aspects are not as easily quantified as price. This results in a dilemma where the <b>public</b> <b>procurer</b> must judge abstract dimension, such as creativity, and translate the judgement to a score or grade. The scoring based system complicates selecting creative work for the <b>public</b> <b>procurer</b> since the evaluation of creative work is of a subjective nature and might only be described by the ‘gut feeling’ rather than objectively proven. Based on case studies, this thesis explores how the quality of creative services in public procurement can be defined, and how the quality of this work is judged. The case study includes two recent public procurements within design and communication. By interviewing both public procurers and tenderers, this thesis aims to provide {{a better understanding of the}} perceptions of quality and how the quality is judged. This study reveals that in public procurements, the quality of a creative service was found to be defined as a strategy that enables a relevant outcome, which results in an impact in a desired direction for the client. The quality was judge based on the tenderer’s previous work, where both strategy and outcome were considered. Different quality aspects were quantified in order for the judgement to be as objective as possible. However, the quality of a creative service was considered to be immeasurable, 1 thus the judgement relied on subjective preferences. This study sheds light on the unexplored field of quality judgement of creative services in public procurements, and is a contribution to both academia and industry. The thesis can serve as a basis for future research as well as a useful tool when procuring creative services...|$|E

40|$|Since the 2000 s e-auctions {{have been}} {{actively}} used {{in public and}} private procurement in many countries. Although e-auction reduces participation costs of companies as compared with outcry auction, it may also encourage companies to bribe the electronic intermediary in order to intervene in e-auction process and block bids of their competitors. The purpose of our model is to examine how the auction format affects the favoritism and the efficiency of public procurement. Unlike the <b>public</b> <b>procurer,</b> the intermediary does not have the favored company and takes bribes from each company. Therefore, if the intermediary sets rather low bribe, that equalizes chances of getting the public contract for companies with different production costs. As a result, incentives for favoritism depend on the costs efficiency of the favored company. The model shows that if the favored company has high production costs, a corrupt intermediary encourages favoritism. On the contrary, if the favored company has low production costs, favoritism becomes less probable in e-auction, than in outcry auction. Hence, even if the intermediary is corrupt, e-auction may provide lower incentives to favoritism and increase social welfare...|$|E
40|$|The {{infrastructure}} delivery worldwide {{has recently}} shifted {{to a new}} paradigm where the government as the <b>public</b> <b>procurer</b> begins {{to rely on the}} private sectors’ sources in providing assets and services at no cost to the government. This revolution ensues due to the government’s dilemma in handling various globalisation issues of the belt-tightening government’s budget, the escalated world oil prices, pressure in confronting abandoned public projects, intention in reducing government’s financial burdens as well as increased taxpayers’ demand on the quality of infrastructure assets and services. Thus, in facing those problems whilst maintaining the control over the infrastructure, an alternative procurement approach known as Private Finance Initiative (PFI) has been introduced. Nevertheless, history has proven that not all infrastructure assets or services are amenable to PFI, indeed experience in other jurisdictions has suggested that in some circumstances infrastructure provided via PFI can lead to poor public accountability, a reduction in competition as well as the development of monopolies. With the facts that different countries practise distinguished concepts and philosophies of PFI for their infrastructure provision based on the nature of their construction industry as well as different countries necessitate diverse types of infrastructure for their nation’s development of their, the urgency of determining the principles of infrastructure to be provided via PFI is significant. Therefore, this study investigates the features and characteristics of infrastructure that is suitable to be provided via PFI with the particular references to Malaysia’s construction industry as Malaysia’s version of PFI emerges in unique forms e. g. DBFO (Design, Build, Finance, Operate), BOO (Build, Own, Operate), BOOST (Build, Own, Operate, Subsidise, Transfer) and BOL (Build, Operate, Lease). Although the Malaysia’s version of PFI is theoretically claimed as merely prompt in providing selected economic infrastructure for both physical assets and services, this study demonstrates that Malaysia’s PFI is also duly implemented for social infrastructure...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Uganda prescribes {{compulsory}} {{competitive tendering}} (CCT) as the procurement technique (as per PPDA act, 2003) to be utilized by public entities {{and local government}} departments in procuring goods, works and services exceeding a given threshold. Establishing the real impact of this procurement process on socio economic objectives is quite essential. This paper specifically assesses how the current tactical level public procurement processes operate and discloses that stakeholders especially the staff involved in executing the procurement planning, preparation of source selection documents and contracting fail to tie together opportunities available for utilizing public procurement as springboard to enhance the realization of growth of SMEs, environmental protection and Empowerment of women, youth and persons with disabilities (PWDs). It also elucidates {{on a range of}} issues regarding how the <b>public</b> <b>procuring</b> entities in Uganda and other developing countries can innovatively remodel their tactical level procurement systems to transform them into more reliable instruments of policy capable of enhancing attainment of diverse procurement objectives and long term socioeconomic development goals in a transparent, cost effective and competitive manner...|$|R
40|$|Public private {{partnership}} (PPP) {{has emerged}} as a more acceptable and beneficial alternative to privatization. Furthermore, the special mind-sets and specific skill-sets needed for successful PPPs are now impacting on the development of construction industries the world over. While their benefits may seem apparent, and of great promise to developing countries in particular, PPP projects present major challenges which, if not adequately addressed, may undermine their very purpose and also lead to a distortion of public sector priorities when choosing which infrastructure to develop. The paper explores these challenges and the implications for developing countries. It also provides an overview of a framework for a Decision Support System (DSS) designed to address the shortfalls in reliable knowledge about when (under what conditions) and how (in what form) PPPs should be mobilised. The DSS framework is being developed as part of an ongoing R&D project that aims to help <b>public</b> <b>procuring</b> agents achieve ‘value for money’ in PPP projects by (1) assisting in ‘better value’ decisions on the ‘PPP-iability’ of proposed projects and (2) providing a means for the live capture, codification and quick transfer of experiential knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Public {{procurement}} {{is one of}} {{the governmental}} key areas which emphasises on the acquisition of goods and services. Governmental organizations across the world tend to spend between 8 % and 25 % of GDP on goods and services.

Rules on public procurement have been enacted, however compliance by <b>public</b> <b>procuring</b> entities is still a challenge, hence the study seek to establish the underlying factors that leads to public non-compliance to procurement regulations in the public sector. An explanatory research design was utilized in the study, the target population being procurement officers of government parastatals in Kenya.

Results indicate that the competitive dialogue can lead to more innovation when overcoming the reserved attitude and risk avoidance of <b>public</b> <b>procuring</b> authorities. Competition in Dutch procurement increased by use of the dialogue, and although the public-private contact in the procurement procedure leads to increased trust, it is hard to maintain this in an environment driven by competition.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{recommendations}} {{coming from}} the reforms of the Country Procurement Assessment Report (2004) was to establish a procurement cadre in the civil service and restoring professionalism in the procurement function. Since then, public procurement has undergone a series of reforms in most developing countries including Uganda which has shaped the professional way of handling the purchasing activity from merely being operational in nature to becoming a strategic function. The recognition that procurement is a truly professional function that requires trained and qualified staff that constitutes a professional procurement cadre started being embraced in Uganda ever since the reforms were embraced. In that regard, avenues for professional career advancement in the procurement field started being provided {{by a number of}} training institutions of higher learning in Uganda, so as to enable the procurement system to attract and retain qualified and experienced personnel.

40|$|Purpose - Procurement {{of public}} {{infrastructure}} that is {{fit for purpose}} partly depends on the competencies of procurement personnel. In many developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Nigeria, there is a deficit in {{the quantity and quality}} of infrastructure and their procurement is further riddled with deficiencies in the capacity of <b>public</b> <b>procuring</b> entities. It is, however, unclear from the extant literature, what are the critical skills development needs of public personnel involved in the procurement of infrastructure in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach – Based on a quantitative research strategy, this study sought to address the knowledge gap through a survey of public infrastructure procurement personnel (n= 288) in different tiers of government (i. e. state and local government) and geopolitical contexts (north and south) in Nigeria. Findings - Of the 45 procurement skill areas operationalised, there is need for further development in 38 of them including: computing/ICT; problem solving; communication; decision making; health and safety management; quality management; relationship management; team building; project monitoring and evaluation; time management; and procurement planning. Originality/value - A key implication of this study is for policy makers in state and local government to formulate and implement infrastructure procurement capacity development reforms that address the competency gaps of procurement personnel. Such reforms need to take into account the suitable methods for developing procurement competencies. Additionally, the procurement skill areas operationalised in this capacity assessment study could serve as a useful blueprint for studying capacity deficiencies amongst public infrastructure procurement personnel in other developing countries...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to present and {{critically}} analyse the dynamic, ongoing development of a socially responsible (SR) procurement framework, based on the contribution of the triple bottom line of social, environmental and economic factors. The case study was conducted in the city of Thessaloniki, Greece, (approx. 315, 000 population) emerging from a period of economic crisis. Design/methodology/approach – The paper opted for a mixed method approach that enables the collection of rich, contextual information from stakeholders whilst undertaking statistical testing of structured data. Data was collection over a year, with three thematic categories identified utilising content analysis. Findings – The paper provides empirical insights about the reestablishment of the city’s municipal services for a SR society. This research provides a significant contribution to further understanding the relationship between SMEs and SR <b>public</b> <b>procuring</b> at municipal level. Research limitations/implications – Due to the case study approach, i. e. undertaken in a municipal setting of a city council emerging from the economic downturn, the research results may lack generalisability. Practical implications – The paper includes implications for economic recovery in a country with a complex public-procurement system, in which youth unemployment has reached almost 45 %. The SR procurement framework forms a valuable tool to its engaging stakeholders (European Commission, 2016).

Since its launch the UK construction sector has witnessed a momentum build in the awareness and adoption of BIM. The 2014 NBS report indicates {{an increase in the}} awareness and current use of BIM from 13 % in 2010 to 54 % in 2013 with a decrease in neither being aware of BIM nor using from 43 % in 2010 to 5 % in 2013. However, the report also identified that one of the key barriers for wider adoption perceived by the industry is the lack of clients demanding BIM, which is considered in part due to limited/no awareness/understanding of and drive for BIM, i. e. clients being uninformed. This chapter aims to explore the BIM journey so far of a local authority public sector client, Manchester City Council (MCC), and to show the transition from being an uninformed client to becoming an informed client through collaborative engagement with their supply chain on the prestige exemplar Manchester Central Library and Town Hall Extension project. The influences of key decisions during this journey and on behaviours that enhance collaboration and cooperation in understanding of BIM requirements are discussed. Furthermore, the challenges, drivers and enablers as well as the key roles, e. g. a visionary champion are explored.

40|$|Gross {{contracts}} {{appear to}} be the most common contract form for <b>procured</b> <b>public</b> transport in Sweden and elsewhere. This contract form, it has been argued, gives weak incentives for operators to deliver the desired quality level. Therefore many <b>procuring</b> <b>public</b> transport authorities amend contracts with quality incentives. This paper examines how such quality incentives influence quality outcomes with focus on cancelled departures and delays. The main findings are that the introduction of quality incentives are correlated with both increases and decreases of measured quality outcomes. We hypothesise that the results are driven by underlying cost changes for achieving desired quality objectives that exceed the possible revenues from the incentives. In interviews with the Stockholm public transport authority (SL) and some operators, two central observations surface. The first is that there are causes for quality failures that are not solely the responsibility of operators and that these are therefore not fully reached by the incentives, and the second is that the operators believe that they have exhausted what they can do under the current contracts.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Masters in Procurement and Supply Management, 2015. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 45). Sustainable procurement (SP) is procurement {{that is consistent with}} the principles of sustainable development. Sustainable procurement is an approach that takes economic, environmental and social sustainability into account when making any purchasing decision. Public procurement is concerned with how public sector organizations spend tax payers’ money. Public procurement is guided by principles of transparency, accountability, and achieving value for money for citizens and tax payers. Public Works Department (PWD) {{is one of the biggest}} <b>public</b> <b>procuring</b> agencies for government in Bangladesh. The current scenario of sustainable procurement practice in the public sector has been studied through interviews with mid level procurement professionals from Public Works Department (PWD) addressing three aspects of sustainability. The analyses indicate that although there are a few cases where some sustainability issues are in practice, these are not very common as a whole in the public sector. Existing tendering system in public sector in Bangladesh is still based on the lowest price approach and whole life costing approach is rarely considered. Hardly any procuring entity has any provision as such an environmental management system. The study indicates that at present there is virtually no mechanism in our public procurement system to check the environmental performance of contractors/ suppliers. Sustainability criteria should be embedded in the tendering system. Knowledge and awareness at the individual procurement professional level seem important in order to make suitable sustainable procurement choices. The study reveals that the respondents are lacking in such knowledge and they are not trained enough. A clear commitment is necessary from the very top of government and down through the ministries and authorities formulating a sustainable procurement policy and to align the public procurement framework with the policy. Awareness campaign should be arranged focusing on how to take account of nonmonetary benefits of sustainable procurement. Finally, there is scope to further study about the sustainability issues in procurement. Advanced research needs to be conducted in order to get a deeper insight into the sustainability issue in relation to the public procurement. Mohammad Abul Kalam AzadM.

40|$|Theoretical {{literature}} suggests {{a variety of}} reasons why a public-private partnership (PPP) should exhibit higher costs of construction than traditionally <b>procured</b> <b>public</b> infrastructure projects. The bundling of construction and operation contracts in a PPP give the private partner greater incentives to make investments in the construction phase to lower subsequent operation and maintenance costs. Also, the transfer of the construction risk to the private partner should be explicitly priced in a PPP. We use data on ex ante construction costs of road projects in Europe to test the existence and the magnitude of any such difference between PPPs and traditional procurement. We estimate the ex ante cost of a PPP road to be, on average, 24 % more expensive than a traditionally procured road, all other things equal. This estimate corresponds by and large to reported ex post cost overruns in traditionally <b>procured</b> <b>public</b> roads. To the extent that the two measures are representative, this suggests that the largest part of the ex ante construction cost difference originates from the transfer of construction risk. This, in turn, implies that other possible sources of higher PPP construction costs, including bundling, seem to be of second-order importance in the road sector. The analysis does not allow drawing normative conclusions about the desirability of PPP as a procurement method as it focuses only on one cost component in isolation, without being able to quantify its impact on life-cycle costs and benefits.
