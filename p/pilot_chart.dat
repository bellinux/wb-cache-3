50|$|Continuing {{the popular}} musical theme, in 1963 the BBC {{recorded}} a <b>pilot</b> <b>chart</b> show, which Stewart produced. Originally called The Teen and Twenty Record Club, it emerged onto the UK screens as Top of the Pops, which continued {{on the air}} until 2006. Its initial presenters, on a rotational basis, were Jimmy Savile, David Jacobs, Alan Freeman and Pete Murray. Samantha Juste, one of the programme's assistants, sat alongside them and placed the records on a turntable. Stewart remained as producer of the programme until 1973, when he was succeeded by Robin Nash. In 1970, he produced the BBC/ZDF TV show Pop Go The Sixties, broadcast across Europe on 1 January 1970.|$|E
50|$|John McElroy {{was one of}} {{the first}} to attempt this in 1941, using a {{speculative}} magnetic chart for the year 1500 and currents from <b>pilot</b> <b>charts.</b> His vast overrun in distance was corrected by a fudge factor, leaving his endpoint in the vicinity of Watlings Island. This result was substantially confirmed by Doug Peck's sailing voyage of 1991.|$|R
50|$|The {{key issue}} {{here is that the}} {{designer}} is interested in the outcome using a wide range of likely weather conditions, whereas the navigator on board a yacht is just interested in using the latest weather forecast. Initial attempts in this area used the mean wind speed and direction data from sources such as <b>Pilot</b> <b>Charts,</b> but this is not truly representative, and the correct route is to run the weather routing a large number of times from a set of historical weather records, and then carry out a statistical analysis of the results.|$|R
50|$|Examining the <b>Pilot</b> <b>Charts</b> {{for this}} area, however, {{it becomes clear}} that the main concern lies in the changes in winds that occur at about the point at which Cape Bojador is passed in sailing down the coast. It is here that the winds start to blow {{strongly}} from the northeast at all seasons. Together with the half-knot set of current down the coast, these conditions would naturally alarm an ignorant and superstitious Medieval mariner used to sailing close to the land and having no knowledge of what lay ahead. In the end it was discovered that by sailing well out to sea—far out of sight of land—a more favorable wind could be picked up.|$|R

40|$|The current {{research}} investigated how {{the design of}} insulin charts affects user performance. Errors {{in the administration of}} insulin are commonly made and often detrimental to patient outcomes. A new subcutaneous insulin chart, the National <b>Pilot</b> <b>Chart,</b> is currently being piloted at several hospitals. Two experiments investigated whether user performance on this chart could be improved by incremental design changes. The experiments focussed on the task of determining the correct dose to administer to the patient. To do this accurately, the chart-user must take into account the patient’s current blood glucose level and any relevant orders (i. e., prescriptions) for “routine” or “supplemental” insulin recorded on the chart. In each experiment, each participant viewed 80 insulin charts on a computer monitor and calculated the total insulin dose required for each patient. Experiment 1 investigated the effect of a change in the format of the Supplemental Insulin Orders box. Experiment 2 retained the novel Supplemental Insulin Orders box format, and varied the format of the Routine Insulin Orders box. Primarily, these chart design changes involved integrating chart objects so that they shared common dimensions (i. e., rows or columns) with other chart objects. In Experiment 1, participants responded significantly faster and made fewer errors when the Supplemental Insulin Orders box was integrated. In Experiment 2, participants responded significantly faster when the Routine Insulin Orders box was also integrated, although there were no differences in errors between chart designs. The implications for chart design and hospital practice are discussed...|$|E
