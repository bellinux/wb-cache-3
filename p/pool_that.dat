5|$|A {{defining}} and best-known {{feature of the}} Mortal Kombat series is its finishing move system called Fatality. An original idea behind it was to give gamers a free hit {{at the end of}} the fight. The basic Fatalities are finishing moves that allow the victorious characters to end a match in a special way by murdering their defeated, defenseless opponents in a gruesome manner, usually in the predefined ways exclusive for the given character. The only exception from this is Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, which instead features the Kreate-A-Fatality, allowing the players to perform their own Fatalities by conducting a series of violent moves chosen from a <b>pool</b> <b>that</b> is common for all characters.|$|E

5|$|An {{electric}} current, in {{the form}} of either alternating current or direct current from a welding power supply, is used to form an electric arc between the electrode and the metals to be joined. The workpiece and the electrode melts forming a pool of molten metal (weld <b>pool)</b> <b>that</b> cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux coating of the electrode disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.|$|E
5|$|On {{the west}} side of Kenongo Island is another one-storeyed {{circular}} structure that forms another artificial island in the past called Gumuling Well (Sumur Gumuling). These one-storeyed building can only be entered via the underwater tunnel. The building was used as a mosque. A niche in the wall of this building was used as a mihrab. The central area of this building is an elevated platform where four staircases meet, and then from the platform, one staircase reach the first floor. On the ground level of this platform is a small <b>pool</b> <b>that</b> was used for Muslim ritual ablution.|$|E
5|$|Welding is a {{fabrication}} or sculptural {{process that}} joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing fusion, which {{is distinct from}} lower temperature metal-joining techniques such as brazing and soldering, which do not melt the base metal. In addition to melting the base metal, a filler material is typically added to the joint to form a pool of molten material (the weld <b>pool)</b> <b>that</b> cools to form a joint that is usually stronger than the base material. Pressure may also be {{used in conjunction with}} heat, or by itself, to produce a weld. Welding also requires a form of shield to protect the filler metals or melted metals from being contaminated or oxidized.|$|E

5|$|Dating Lindow Man is {{problematic}} as {{samples from the}} body and surrounding peat have produced dates spanning a 900-year period. Although the peat encasing Lindow Man has been radiocarbon dated to about 300BC, Lindow Man himself has a different date. Early tests at different laboratories returned conflicting dates for the body; later tests suggested a date between 2BC and 119AD. There has been a tendency to ascribe the body to the Iron Age period rather than Roman due to the interpretation that Lindow Man's death {{may have been a}} ritual sacrifice or execution. Explanations for why the peat in which he was found is much older have been sought. Archaeologist P.C.Buckland suggests that as the stratigraphy of the peat appears undisturbed, Lindow Man may have been deposited into a <b>pool</b> <b>that</b> was already some 300years old. Geographer K.E.Barber has argued against this hypothesis, saying that pools at Lindow Moss would have been too shallow, and suggests that the peat may have been peeled back to allow the burial and then replaced, leaving the stratigraphy apparently undisturbed.|$|E
