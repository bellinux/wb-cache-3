A study of prawns occurring in <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> catches in Cochin and Karnataka region,and also {{the comparison of}} its size composition has been attempted.

When there was very high catch M. dobsoni formed almost 100 % of the landings. More or less the same ratio of sex distribution as at Cochin was noticed at both Mangalore and Malpe, the female to male ratio being 56 : 44. In comparison to the sizes landed at Cochin during the pre-monsoon period the sizes occurring in the <b>purse</b> <b>seines</b> at Mangalore and Malpe were much higher. The modal sizes of the prawns in the catches of both <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> and trawl net in males as well as females are exactly the same in both centres, although the trawl catches at Maipe shows a much wider range in sizes when compared to the <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> catches.

This paper attempts to present the current condition of small pelagic fishery in the Makassar Strait. Catch and effort (trip) data between 2004 and 2011 from the three landing sites were used to estimate Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) using Schaefer & Fox models. The results showed a decreasing trend in the catch rate, from 30. 83 tons/trip in 2004 to 12. 27 tons/trip in 2011.

40|$|Catch {{regulation}} by slipping {{whole or}} parts of the catch has traditionally been used in NE-Atlantic <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> fisheries for pelagic species if the catches are considered too big or the quality or size of the fish is considered unsatisfactory.

No information is, however, available on the survival rate of herring that is slipped from the <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> or how significant this mortality is in relation to total fishing mortality. The {{aim of this study}} is to quantify mortality of herring crowded to different degrees in the <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> and subsequently slipped.

40|$|Tuna {{fisheries}} {{in the western}} and central Pacific Ocean are important globally for both food and economic security. Yellowfin and bigeye tuna stocks in this region are declining, {{in part due to}} the juvenile bycatch of these species by the <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> fishery using floating objects and fish aggregating devices (FADs). This leads to a conflict between the longline and handline fisheries, which target adult fish, and the <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> fishery, whose bycatch is leading to growth overfishing.
