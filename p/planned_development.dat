The area surrounding the station consists of a mixture of <b>planned</b> <b>development,</b> commercial, and residential areas. Citicorp Plaza, an office building which houses the headquarters of telecommunications provider U.S. Cellular, is located to the south of Cumberland at 8410 W. Bryn Mawr.

Due to the neighborhood's proximity to both Lake Michigan to the east and the Chicago River to the north, many of the buildings are named with aquatic or nautical themes. As of August 2008, 1,500 condominiums have been sold and 1,200 apartments have been completed.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair {{had become}} one of the UK's best-known millionaires, and earned a knighthood, {{on the back of the}} highly {{successful}} Sinclair Research range of home computers in the early 1980s. He hoped to repeat his success in the electric vehicle market, which he saw as ripe for a new approach. The C5 emerged from an earlier project to produce a small electric car called the C1. After a change in the law, prompted by lobbying from bicycle manufacturers, Sinclair developed the C5 as an electrically powered tricycle with a polypropylene body and a chassis designed by Lotus Cars. It was intended to be the first in a series of increasingly ambitious electric vehicles, but in the event the <b>planned</b> <b>development</b> of the follow-up C10 and C15 electric cars never got further than the drawing board.|$|E

On September27, 1911, George Edward Harmison (1863–1916) conducted a public auction of Valley View farm's fields atop Yellow Banks overlooking the South Branch Potomac River. The land was located atop the hill to the west of Valley. Harmison subdivided the fields into lots, and the <b>planned</b> <b>development</b> was known as the Valley View Addition to Romney. Harmison sold 21 of the land lots at the auction, and several lots were sold privately. A free lot was given to J.H. Newhouse, and Harmison set aside two lots on a bluff for the site of a future hospital, which he planned to deed to any entity willing to build one.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s, the old turnpike {{was renamed}} the Midlothian Turnpike and {{became part of}} the new east-west U.S. Route 60.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{developer}} Dennis Maloomian acquired {{a golf course}} near the King of Prussia Mall and planned a mixed-use residential and retail development that would include a town center for King of Prussia. The proposed development needed to be rezoned but Upper Merion Township officials and local residents were opposed to the plans. After several court battles, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in Maloomian's favor in 2003. The <b>planned</b> <b>development</b> {{became known as the}} Village at Valley Forge and would include a suburban downtown, apartments, townhouses, and offices. The retail area would be known as the King of Prussia Town Center. The first part of the town center was completed in 2014 with the opening of a Wegmans grocery store. This was followed by the construction of the downtown area with several stores and restaurants. Offices are being constructed and residential areas are in development.|$|E

In February 2004, the company stated that, in addition to seeking investment, it had been evaluating potential manufacturing sites in Europe and Asia prior to initiating a <b>planned</b> <b>development</b> phase later that year. It was said that feasibility studies and market analysis indicated that there was a global demand for around 250 such aircraft over the next ten years; furthermore, that it was proposing three different versions of the aircraft, each one for a different market segment: A surveillance variant for government agencies, a 12-seat regional airliner configuration aimed at charter operators, and a six-seat layout that was suited to VIP customers. In August 2006, there were claims made that the project was close to being relaunched with backing from firms in Singapore and Abu Dhabi, the latter being contingent upon the Seastar being manufactured in Abu Dhabi.|$|E
25|$|In 1907, Ugyen Wangchuck {{was elected}} as the {{hereditary}} ruler of Bhutan, crowned on December 17, 1907, and installed {{as the head}} of state, the Druk Gyalpo (Dragon King). In 1910, King Ugyen and the British signed the Treaty of Punakha which provided that British India would not interfere {{in the internal affairs of}} Bhutan if the country accepted external advice in its external relations. When Ugyen Wangchuck died in 1926, his son Jigme Wangchuck became ruler, and when India gained independence in 1947, the new Indian Government recognized Bhutan as an independent country. In 1949 India and Bhutan signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship, which provided that India would not interfere in Bhutan's internal affairs, but would guide its foreign policy. Succeeded in 1952 by his son Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, Bhutan began to slowly emerge from its isolation and began a program of <b>planned</b> <b>development.</b> The National Assembly of Bhutan, the Royal Bhutanese Army, and the Royal Court of Justice were established, along with a new code of law.

25|$|Coal mining in India has a {{long history}} of {{commercial}} exploitation starting in 1774 with John Sumner and Suetonius Grant Heatly of the East India Company in the Raniganj Coalfield along the Western bank of Damodar River. Demand for coal remained low until the introduction of steam locomotives in 1853. After this, production rose to an annual average of 1 Mt and India produced 6.12 Mt per year by 1900 and 18 Mt per year by 1920, following increased demand in the First World War, but went through a slump in the early thirties. The production reached a level of 29 Mt by 1942 and 30 Mt by 1946. After independence, the country embarked upon five-year development plans. At the beginning of the 1st Plan, annual production went up to 33 Mt. During the 1st Plan period, the need for increasing coal production efficiently by systematic and scientific development of the coal industry was being felt. Setting up the National Coal Development Corporation (NCDC), a Government of India undertaking, in 1956 with the collieries owned by the railways as its nucleus was the first major step towards <b>planned</b> <b>development</b> of Indian Coal Industry. Along with the Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL) which was already in operation since 1945 and which became a government company under the control of Government of Andhra Pradesh in 1956, India thus had two Government coal companies in the fifties. SCCL is now a joint undertaking of Government of Telangana and Government of India.|$|E
