2500|$|Millennia {{later in}} Dune, the Bene Gesserit base {{of power is}} the Mother School on the planet Wallach IX, whose {{graduates}} are fit mates for Emperors, and whose specially trained Truthsayers can detect falsehood. But beyond the outer virtues of poise, self-control, and diplomacy, Bene Gesserit training includes superior combat skills and precise <b>physiological</b> <b>control</b> that grants them direct control over conception and embryotic sex determination, ageing, and even the ability to render poisons harmless within their bodies. The Bene Gesserit power of Voice allows them to control others by merely modulating their vocal tones. Sisters who survive a ritualized poisoning known as the spice agony achieve increased awareness and abilities through access to Other Memory, and are subsequently known as Reverend Mothers. Every member of the Bene Gesserit is conditioned into singular loyalty to the order and its goals with allegiances to even family being secondary, and no goal is more paramount than the Sisterhood's large-scale breeding program. It aims to create a superbeing that can tap into abilities even the Bene Gesserit cannot, a being whom they can use {{in order to gain}} more direct control over the universe. To this end, the Bene Gesserit have subtly manipulated bloodlines for generations, using breeding sisters to [...] "collect" [...] the genes they require.|$|E

40|$|Biotin {{affects the}} {{abundance}} of mRNA coding for ~ 10 % of genes expressed in human-derived hepatocarcinoma (HepG 2) cells. Here, we determined whether effects of biotin on gene expression are associated with changes in {{the abundance of}} distinct proteins in cell signaling and structure. HepG 2 {{cells were cultured in}} media containing the following concentrations of biotin: 0. 025 nmol/L (denoted “deficient”), 0. 25 nmol/L (“physiological” = control), and 10 nmol/L (“pharmacological”) for 10 d before harvesting. The abundance of 1009 proteins from whole-cell extracts was quantified by using high-throughput immunoblots. The abundance of 44 proteins changed by at least 25 % in biotin-deficient and biotin-supplemented cells compared with <b>physiological</b> <b>controls.</b> One third of these proteins participate in cell signaling. Specifically, proteins associated with receptor tyrosine kinase–mediated signaling were identified as targets of biotin; the abundance of these proteins was greater in biotin-deficient cells than in controls. This was associated with increased DNA-binding activities of the transcription factors Fos and Jun, and increased expression of a reporter gene driven by activator protein (AP) 1 -binding elements in biotin-deficient cells compared with <b>physiological</b> <b>controls.</b> The abundance of selected signaling proteins was not paralleled by the abundance of mRNA, suggesting that biotin affects expression of these genes at a post-transcriptional step. Additional clusters of biotin-responsive proteins were identified that play roles in cytoskeleton homeostasis, nuclear structure and transport, and neuroscience. This study is consistent with the existence of clusters of biotin-responsive proteins in distinct biological processes, including signaling by Fos/Jun; the latter might mediate the proinflammatory and antiapoptotic effects of biotin deficiency...|$|R

Major advances have been made regarding cross talk between metabolic signals and the cognitive/emotional brain that primarily deals with the environment.

40|$|The <b>physiological</b> {{mechanisms}} <b>controlling</b> the growth, lactation {{and reproductive}} cycles of cervids, {{and the control}} of allocation of energy to different organs are discussed. The growth cycle may be secondary to an appetite cycle, regulated by changes in the secretion of prolactin, gonadal steroids, and possibly unknown factors. The reproductive cycle is controlled by changes in the release at the hypothalamic hormone GnRH, and by changes in the feedback effect of gonadal steroids. These cycles {{are probably the result}} of the timing effects of nutrition and changing photoperiod on an endogenous, circannual rhythm. The effect of photopenod is mediated by the pineal hormone melatonin.

In this thesis, the long-lived (+ 100 years) boreal mollusc (Bivalvia) Arctica islandica is shown to be practical for this purpose in the northern North Atlantic Ocean. The evidence, compiled here, demonstrates that the carbonate shell of this species faithfully records the ambient dissolved inorganic carbon`s (DIC) radiocarbon ({Delta}{sup 14 }C) concentration and accurately reflects the ambient temperature in its stable oxygen isotope ({delta}{sup 18 }O) composition.

A balance among the mass transfer processes of ethanol vapour in the package results in ethanol vapour accumulation in the package headspace.

40|$|Dimension and {{structure}} of extracellular matrix surfaces have powerful influences on cell shape, adhesion, and gene expression. Here we show that natural tooth root topographies induce integrin-mediated extracellular matrix signaling cascades in tandem with cell elongation and polarization to generate physiological periodontium-like tissues. In this study we replanted surface topography instructed periodontal progenitors into rat alveolar bone sockets for 8 and 16 weeks, resulting in complete reattachment of tooth roots to the surrounding alveolar bone with a periodontal fiber apparatus closely matching <b>physiological</b> <b>controls</b> along the entire root surface. Displacement studies and biochemical analyses confirmed that progenitor-based engineered periodontal tissues were similar to control teeth and uniquely derived from preimplantation green fluorescent protein (GFP) -labeled progenitors. Together, these studies illustrate the capacity of natural extracellular surface topographies to instruct progenitor cell populations to fully regenerate complex cellular and structural morphologies of tissues once lost to disease. We suggest that our strategy {{could be used for}} the replantation of teeth lost due to trauma or as a novel approach for tooth replacement using tooth-shaped replicas...|$|R
