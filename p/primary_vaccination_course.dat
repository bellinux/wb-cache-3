40|$|Hepatitis A {{is one of}} {{the most}} common vaccine-preventable {{infectious}} diseases in the world. Effective vaccines against hepatitis A have been available since 1992, and they provide long-term immunity against the infection. However, there is no worldwide consensus on how long protection will last or whether there will be a need for hepatitis A virus (HAV) booster vaccinations in the future. In most countries, booster-vaccination policy is guided by manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 recommendations, national authorities, or both. In June, 2002, a panel of international experts met to review the long-term immunogenicity and protection conferred by HAV vaccine in different population groups. Data have shown that after a full <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination</b> <b>course,</b> protective antibody amounts persist beyond 10 years in healthy individuals, and underlying immune memory provides protection far beyond the duration of anti-HAV antibodies. The group concluded that there is no evidence to lend support to HAV booster vaccination after a full <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination</b> <b>course</b> in a healthy individual. However, further investigations are needed before deciding if boosters can be omitted in special patient-groups...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis A and B {{are serious}} vaccine-preventable {{diseases}} with a predominantly overlapping epidemiological distribution. Travelers, a term encompassing {{a range of}} individuals, {{are at risk of}} contracting these diseases if they are unvaccinated. Although the benefits of the <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination</b> <b>course</b> of hepatitis A and B vaccines are clear, the administration of hepatitis A and B boosters varies worldwide. Recommendations on the need for booster vaccinations have recently been published, and the implications of these recommendations for travelers are discussed in this review. Until a greater understanding is reached on the immunogenicity of hepatitis A and B vaccines in certain special groups (e. g., immunocompromised persons), there will be a need to monitor antibody levels to assess whether booster vaccinations are required. However, for the majority of immunocompetent travelers, the full <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination</b> <b>course</b> will provide protection from both hepatitis A and B infection in the long term, without the need for boosters. Hepatitis A and B are serious diseases with a widespread and predominantly overlapping epidemiological distribution (figure 1) [1, 2].

40|$|AbstractCombination {{vaccines}} against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP) {{represent the}} core of childhood vaccination programs. Quinvaxem, a fully-liquid, pentavalent combination vaccine containing inactivated hepatitis B (HepB), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and whole-cell pertussis (wP) antigens, and tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, {{has been shown to}} be suitable for boosting children primed in infancy with another DTwP–HepB–Hib vaccine. This single-blind, randomized, controlled study was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of a <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination</b> <b>course</b> (6 – 10 – 14 week schedule) of Tritanrix HB+Hib (first dose) and Quinvaxem (second/third doses) versus three doses of Quinvaxem with respect to the seroprotection/seroconversion rates for all antigens one month after vaccination course completion. Four hundred healthy subjects eligible for the local Expanded Program on Immunization were enrolled and equally randomized to the two treatment regimens. All subjects achieved seroprotection for tetanus and Hib, all except one for diphtheria, and all except two achieved seroconversion against Bordetella pertussis. Seroprotection against hepatitis B was achieved by 97. 4 % of Tritanrix HB+Hib followed by Quinvaxem and 94. 9 % of Quinvaxem subjects. Therefore, one month after vaccination course completion, seroprotection rates (seroconversion rate for B. pertussis) of Tritanrix HB+Hib followed by Quinvaxem were non-inferior to those elicited by Quinvaxem only, thus meeting the primary objective. Adverse events were comparable between the groups and were in line with the safety profile of the vaccines. The switch of vaccine had no apparent effect on safety endpoints.

40|$|Introduction: Vaccination {{with the}} major surface antigen of {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBsAg) induces anti-HBs antibody production and level of 10 IU/L is considered protective. It {{has been shown that}} the level of anti-HBs antibody does wane after vaccination. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the persistence of anti-HBs antibodies in healthy Iranian children 10 years after <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination.</b> Methods: Blood samples were collected from 146 children, 10 years after completion of <b>primary</b> hepatitis B <b>vaccination</b> <b>course</b> at birth. The sera were tested for anti-HBs, antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) and HBsAg by use of ELISA technique. Results: At 10 years after <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination,</b> 70 (47. 9 %) children had protective levels of antibody (anti-HBs> 10 IU/L) with mean titer of 68. 1 IU/ml. Moreover, 45 (30. 82 %) children were negative for anti-HBs antibody. Distribution of children according to anti-HBs concentration revealed that the proportion of subjects with antibody titer of 0 - 10 IU/L, 10 - 100 IU/L, 100 - 500 IU/L and 500 - 1000 IU/L was 52. 1 %, 24. 6 %, 20. 5 % and 2. 7 %, respectively. All children were negative for HBsAg, although anti-HBc was positive in 11 (7. 5 %) children. There was no difference in the seroprotection rates of males and females. Conclusion: The results of present study show that after 10 years after <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination</b> with recombinant HB vaccine, 47. 9 % of the children had protective levels of anti-HBs antibody. On basis of the HBsAg and anti-HBc results, it seems that effective immunological memory exists in children.

40|$|Due {{to their}} lower rate of adverse events, {{acellular}} pertussis vaccines (diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis; DTaP) replaced whole cell vaccines (diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis; DTwP) in {{many developed countries}} during the 1990 s. DTaP became available in Queensland, Australia, in 1996 and replaced DTwP for publicly funded primary course immunizations delivered at ages 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months in March 1999.

40|$|AbstractDespite {{years of}} {{biannual}} mass vaccination of cattle, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) remains uncontrolled in Anatolian Turkey. To evaluate protection after mass vaccination we measured post-vaccination antibodies in {{a cohort of}} cattle (serotypes O, A and Asia- 1). To obtain results reflecting typical field protection, participants were randomly sampled from across Central and Western Turkey after routine vaccination. Giving two-doses one month apart is recommended when cattle are first vaccinated against FMD. However, due to cost and logistics, this is not routinely performed in Turkey, and elsewhere. Nested within the cohort, we conducted a randomised trial comparing post-vaccination antibodies after a single-dose versus a two-dose <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination</b> <b>course.</b> Four to five months after vaccination, {{only a third of}} single-vaccinated cattle had antibody levels above a threshold associated with protection. A third never reached this threshold, even at peak response one month after vaccination. It was not until animals had received three vaccine doses in their lifetime, vaccinating every six months, that most (64 % to 86 % depending on serotype) maintained antibody levels above this threshold. By this time cattle would be > 20 months old with almost half the population below this age. Consequently, many vaccinated animals will be unprotected for much of the year. Compared to a single-dose, a <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination</b> <b>course</b> of two-doses greatly improved the level and duration of immunity. We concluded that the FMD vaccination programme in Anatolian Turkey did not produce the high levels of immunity required. Higher potency vaccines are now used throughout Turkey, with a two-dose primary course in certain areas. Monitoring post-vaccination serology is an important component of evaluation for FMD vaccination programmes. However, consideration must be given to which antigens are present in the test, the vaccine and the field virus.

40|$|AbstractCanine leishmaniasis, an {{important}} zoonotic disease of dogs, {{is the result}} of an ineffective and inappropriate immune response to infection with Leishmania infantum. It is widely accepted that the appropriate immune response is characterised by a T-helper (Th) 1 -dominated profile in an overall mixed Th 1 /Th 2 response. The absence of a strong Th 1 response is associated with progression to the clinical disease. Thus, {{there is a need for}} an effective vaccine that could modulate the immune response to a more appropriate profile against the parasite. In this study we measured the impact of the LiESP/QA- 21 canine vaccine, recently launched commercially in Europe, on selected humoral and cellular immune markers for one year after a <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination</b> <b>course.</b> The humoral response to vaccination was characterised by a predominantly IgG 2 profile. Vaccinated dogs developed long-lasting cell-mediated immune responses against L. infantum, specifically with a stronger ability of macrophages to reduce intracellular parasite burdens in co-culture with autologous lymphocytes compared to control dogs (p= 0. 0002), which was correlated with induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and production of nitric oxide (NO) derivatives.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective and open clinical study, in which 110 infants were immunized with a three-dose primary vaccination regime at two, four {{and six months}} of age and with a single booster vaccination. Blood samples were drawn immediately before the first dose, {{one month after the}} third dose, {{at the time of the}} booster dose and one month after the booster to assess seropositivity and antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) of antibodies for diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b and for the three pertussis antigens: Pertussis Toxin (PT), Filamentous Hemagglutinin (FHA) and Pertactin (PRN). RESULTS: Among the original 110 infants, 93 completed the study. Seropositivity was 100 % for all seven involved antibodies, after the <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination</b> <b>course.</b> At the time of the booster dose, all antibodies (except diphtheria 33. 7 % and anti-PT 59 %) were seropositive for more than 94 % of subjects. After the booster, seropositivity increased to 100 % for all antibodies. The GMT of these antibodies followed a similar pattern, with a strong increase after the primary course, followed by a second increase after the booster dose. At this time, GMT was 2 - to 7 -fold higher than after the primary course, for all vaccine components.

METHODS: A cohort study with 80 % power, within 95 % confidence limits, to show that 80 % or fewer Asian infants would respond with an anti-PRP antibody concentration > 0. 15 microg/ml. Infants of South Asian origin born in Berkshire were enrolled at two general practices in Reading: 41 Asian families sequentially asked to participate within 2 weeks of birth; 36 infants were enrolled and 34 completed the study. Main outcome measures were: antibody concentration against diphtheria, tetanus, and Hib expressed as geometric mean titres (GMT) and proportion of infants about a threshold protective antibody concentration.

To ensure adequate antigen supply, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals {{has introduced a}} new DTPw antigen source and developed a new DTPw-HBV/Hib combination vaccine containing a reduced amount of Hib polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP). This study was undertaken to compare the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of this new DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccine with a licensed DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccine (Tritanrix ™-HBV/Hib). Methods This was a randomized, partially-blind, multicenter study in three countries in Latin America (Argentina, Chile and Nicaragua). Healthy children received either the new DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccine (1 of 3 lots; n = 439; double-blind) or Tritanrix™-HBV/Hib (n = 146; single-blind) co-administered with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) at 2, 4 and 6 months, with a booster dose at 18 - 24 months. Results One month {{after the end of}} the 3 -dose <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination</b> <b>course,</b> the new DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccine was non-inferior to Tritanrix™-HBV/Hib in terms of seroprotection/vaccine response rates for all component antigens; ≥ 97. 3 % and ≥ 93. 9 % of subjects in the two groups, respectively, had seroprotective levels of antibodies against diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B and Hib and a vaccine response to the pertussis component. Persistence of antibodies against all vaccine antigens was comparable between groups, with marked increases in all antibody concentrations after booster administration in both groups. Both vaccines were generally well-tolerated as primary and booster doses. Conclusions Results confirm the suitability of this new DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccine comprising antigens from a new source and a reduced PRP content for inclusion into routine childhood vaccination programs.

40|$|Vaccine trials with infants {{enrolled}} between 6 and 10 {{weeks of}} age (young infants) and 6 and 8 {{months of age}} (older infants) provided an opportunity to evaluate immunoglobulin G (IgG) isotype distribution and avidity maturation as indicators of antibody function and immunologic memory. Following vaccination with a strain-specific outer membrane vaccine, MeNZB, pre- and postvaccination sera {{were used to determine}} IgG isotype responses and avidity indices (AI) in subsets of vaccinated subjects. Measurements of IgG isotypes involved 100 infants from each trial. AI were measured in 50 infants from the young infant trial who received a fourth vaccine dose and in 40 older infants from whom serum was collected 7 months after the <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination</b> <b>course.</b> IgG 1 and IgG 3 dominated the responses to the vaccine. A modest linear correlation (P < 0. 001) occurred between serum bactericidal antibody (SBAb) titers and the total IgG or the IgG 1 antibody units in older infants. The young infants showed a modest linear correlation between SBAb and total IgG (P = 0. 005) and a weak linear correlation between SBAb and IgG 1 (P = 0. 003). Increased avidity with age was demonstrated in both groups. The AI in the young infants increased from 51. 5 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 47. 7 to 54. 7) postvaccination to 68. 7 % (95 % CI, 65. 5 to 71. 9 %) following the fourth dose of vaccine (P < 0. 001). The mean avidity of the older infants increased significantly (P = 0. 00012) from 42. 4 % (95 % CI, 39. 1 to 45. 3 %) postvaccination to 50. 4 % (95 % CI, 47. 2 to 53. 6 %) 4 months later. A fourth dose of MeNZB is now being given to young infants at 10 months of age...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the response to hepatitis B (HB) revaccination of healthcare workers (HCW) who are negative for antibodies to HB surface antigen (anti-HBs) after a complete vaccination series. METHODS: HCW whose anti-HBs test was performed > 90 days after a HB <b>vaccination</b> <b>course</b> were given a 4 th dose. A post-vaccination test was done within 30 to 90 days. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy HCW were enrolled: 126 (74. 1 %) were anti-HBs-positive after the 4 th dose. CONCLUSIONS: Rechecking anti-HBs after the 4 th HB vaccine dose is a practical approach in case of post-vaccination tests performed > 90 days after the full <b>vaccination</b> <b>course...</b>|$|R
40|$|Vaccination against Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) became {{mandatory}} in Italy for all newborns and 12 years-old {{individuals in the}} 1991. The immunogenicity of HBV vaccine {{and the effectiveness of}} the universal immunization strategy have been widely demonstrated. However the need to assess the antibody concentrations above the well known serological correlate of protection for HBV infection (≥ 10 mIU/mL), established in individuals immunized with a 3 doses vaccination course, is still recommended in subjects exposed to occupational risks in different settings, particularly the healthcare services. This practice has to be performed during the preventive medical examination, before the worker’s exposure to biological hazards, as a fundamental part of Occupational Health Surveillance Programs in several Countries, including Italy: the goal is to assure individual protection, also providing booster doses when needed, after many years following the primary vaccination. During the 2011 - 2013 period, an observational study was performed in Healthcare students (HCSs) trained at a regional university acute-care hospital in North- Western Italy, properly immunized against HBV during infancy or adolescence, in order to evaluate the persistence of seroprotection and to assess the anamnestic response to booster vaccination. Data from 717 subjects undergoing HbsAg Ab and HBc Ab testing during the preventive medical examination, and receiving a booster dose of HBV vaccine when resulting with a non-protective titer (< 10 mIU/mL), were collected and analyzed. Most of the HCSs (74. 6 %) included in the survey, mean age 24. 8 y (± 4. 6 SD), had received the <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination</b> <b>course</b> {{during the first year of}} life (3 - 5 - 11 months). Globally, 507 (70. 7 %) HCSs showed protective antibody titres, and an anamnestic response was observed in more than 95 % subjects receiving the booster dose. Our study demonstrated the long-term persistence of protection of HBV vaccine, more than 20 y following the primary immunization, in HCSs who are exposed to occupational health risk. The anamnestic response observed in non-seroprotected subjects who received the booster further confirms the capability of the HBV vaccine to create a strong immunological memory...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Aim of {{the present}} study was to {{demonstrate}} the relevance of the vaccine strain of a new BVD vaccine, PregSure® BVD, for its use in Europe. Furthermore the vaccine¿s ability to protect from pregnancy losses due to an early infection with BVDV after artificial insemination was determined. Material and methods: The immune sera used in the in-vitro cross neutralisation were collected from 20 heifers three weeks after the completion of the primary vaccination schedule with PregSure® BVD (two vaccinations given 21 days apart). The BVDV cross-neutralising activity of these postvaccinal sera was tested by virus neutralisation employing a panel of different predominantly European BVDV type I and II strains. Furthermore, two fertility studies were carried out, where heifers between 14 and 39 months of age were primovaccinated with PregSure® BVD or left untreated as control, respectively. All animals had their oestrus cycles synchronised and were artificially inseminated. Four days after the initial artificial insemination and again three days later, all animals of experimental group 1 were challenged intranasally with two heterologous noncytopathic BVDV type I strains, whereas animals from group 2 received a type I and a type II BVDV strain. Sixty-nine to 72 days after the challenge, all dams were slaughtered and their foetuses collected. Differences in pregnancy rates between the vaccinated and the control group were assessed and then analysed using Fisher¿s Exact Test. Results: Heifers vaccinated with a novel inactivated BVDV vaccine containing a cytopathic BVDV type I strain 5960, were shown to have serum neutralising antibody titres between 5. 5 to 12. 3 log 2 against all BVDV strains tested, three weeks after the completion of their <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination</b> <b>course.</b> In the first fertility experiment, pregnancy rates assessed 69 - 72 days after a double challenge with two different BVDV type I strains were 95. 5 % in the vaccinated group versus only 40. 9 % in the control group. A level of cross-protection against a severe BVDV type II challenge was shown in the second experiment with pregnancy rates of 47. 6 % in the vaccinated group and only 4. 4 % in the control group. Conclusions and clinical relevance: The broad cross neutralising activity shown in this study demonstrates the relevance of the vaccine strain 5960 for use in Europe. Furthermore as shown with significantly improved pregnancy in the two fertility experiments, PregSure® BVD vaccinated heifers are protected against fertility losses caused by acute BVDV infections...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} immunogenicity and reactogenicity of <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination</b> with reduced-antigen-content diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (dTpa) or dTpa-inactivated poliovirus (dTpa-IPV) vaccine {{compared to}} diphtheria-tetanus-toxoid vaccines (Td) in adults > or = 40 {{years of age}} without diphtheria or tetanus vaccination for 20 years or with an unknown vaccination history. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial. <b>Primary</b> <b>vaccination</b> with either three doses of dTpa, one dose of dTpa-IPV followed by two doses of Td, or three doses of Td vaccine (control) administered in a 0 - 1 - 6 -month schedule. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood samples were collected before commencement and 1 month after each dose. Local and general symptoms were solicited for 15 days after each dose. RESULTS: A total of 460 adults were enrolled, of whom over 48 % did not have protective antibody concentrations against diphtheria and tetanus. One month after dose 3 > 99 % had seroprotective anti-diphtheria and tetanus antibodies. Three doses were required to maximize anti-diphtheria seroprotection rates. A vaccine response to pertussis antigens was observed in > 92 % of dTpa and dTpa-IPV recipients after dose 1. One month after dTpa-IPV, > 98. 4 % had seroprotective anti-polio titres. No statistically significant differences in local or general symptoms between groups were observed. CONCLUSIONS: dTpa and dTpa-IPV can provide <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination</b> of adults. Combinations of dTpa or dTpa-IPV {{can be used to}} replace Td and provide booster vaccination against pertussis and polio simultaneously with diphtheria and tetanus, even in situations where the <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination</b> history is unknown...|$|R
40|$|The {{resurgence}} of pertussis suggests {{the need for}} greater efforts in understanding the long-lasting protective responses induced by vaccination. In this paper we dissect the persistence of humoral and B-cell memory responses induced by <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination</b> with two different acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines, hexavalent Hexavac(®) vaccine (Hexavac) (Sanofi Pasteur MSD) and Infanrix hexa(®) (Infanrix) (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals). We evaluated the specific immune responses {{in the two groups}} of children, 5 years after <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination</b> by measuring the persistence of IgG and antibody secreting cells (ASC) specific for vaccine antigens. Part of the enrolled children received only <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination,</b> while others had the pre-school boost dose. A similar level of antigen-specific IgG and ASC was found in Infanrix and Hexavac vaccinated children. The mean IgG levels were significantly higher in children that received the pre-school boost as compared with children that did not receive the boost dose. A longer persistence after the pre-school boost of IgG-Pertussis Toxin (PT) and IgG-pertactin levels was observed in Infanrix primed children, but it was not statistically significant. More than 80 % of children presented a positive ASC B memory response. Around 50 % of children still presented protective IgG-PT levels which are reduced to 36 % in no-boosted children. The pre-school booster dose restores the percentage of protected children above 50 %. In conclusion our data underline the importance of giving a booster dose 5 years after <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination</b> and suggest the need for a new vaccine able to induce a long lasting protective response.
