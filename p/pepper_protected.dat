The tubeteika is worn {{typically}} by the Turkic ethnic groups of the region. It bears some superficial resemblance to the yurt, another Central Asian cultural icon. The cap is called in Uzbek duppi or kalpoq and is considered an applied art form and {{an important part of the}} traditional folk costume. Black with a flat, square base, The -ka at the end is a Russian diminutive, as with , ushanka and budenovka. In Chust the caps are made with white embrodiery with [...] "four arches which represent impenetrable gates that will keep all enemies at bay; the burning <b>peppers</b> <b>protect</b> against the evil eye; and the almonds or bodom are said to symbolise life and fertility".|$|R

40|$|Abstract Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) {{have the}} {{potential}} to be used as microbial inoculants to reduce disease incidence and severity and to increase crop yield. Some of the PGPR have been reported to be able to enter plant tissues and establish endophytic populations. Here, we demonstrated an approach to screen bacterial endophytes that have the capacity to promote the growth of <b>pepper</b> seedlings and <b>protect</b> <b>pepper</b> plants against a bacterial pathogen. Initially, out of 150 bacterial isolates collected from healthy stems of peppers cultivated in the Chungcheong and Gyeongsang provinces of Korea, 23 putative endophytic isolates that were considered to be predominating and representative of each pepper sample were selected. By phenotypic characterization and partial 16 S rDNA sequence analysis, the isolates were identified as species of Ochrobacterium, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas, Janthinobacterium, Ralstonia, Arthrobacter...|$|R

Our approach combines effective vision algorithms with a novel end-effector design to enable successful harvesting of sweet peppers. Initial field trials in protected cropping environments, with two cultivar, demonstrate the efficacy of this approach achieving a 46 % success rate for unmodified crop, and 58 % for modified crop. Furthermore, for the more favourable cultivar we were also able to detach 90 % of sweet peppers, indicating that improvements in the grasping success rate would result in greatly improved harvesting performance...|$|R

It can detect the suspicious noise {{by adjusting the}} filter window size and adopting the filter algorithm of adaptive texture direction in low density noise area and the filter algorithm of euclidean distance weighted average in high density noise area. Experimental results show that this method has better de-noising and detail-preserving performance...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the lessons learnt during the {{development}} of a new robotic harvester (Harvey) that can autonomously harvest sweet <b>pepper</b> (capsicum) in <b>protected</b> cropping environments. Robotic harvesting offers an attractive potential solution to reducing labour costs while enabling more regular and selective harvesting, optimising crop quality, scheduling and therefore profit. Our approach combines effective vision algorithms with a novel end-effector design to enable successful harvesting of sweet peppers. We demonstrate a simple and effective vision-based algorithm for crop detection, a grasp selection method, and a novel end-effector design for harvesting. To reduce complexity of motion planning and to minimise occlusions we focus on picking sweet <b>peppers</b> in a <b>protected</b> cropping environment where plants are grown on planar trellis structures. Initial field trials in protected cropping environments, with two cultivars, demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. The results show that the robot harvester can successfully detect, grasp, and detach crop from the plant within a real protected cropping system. The novel contributions of this work have resulted in significant and encouraging improvements in sweet pepper picking success rates compared with the state-of-the-art. Future work will look at detecting sweet pepper peduncles and improving the total harvesting cycle time for each sweet pepper. The methods presented in this paper provide steps towards the goal of fully autonomous and reliable crop picking systems that will revolutionise the horticulture industry by reducing labour costs, maximising the quality of produce, and ultimately improving the sustainability of farming enterprises...|$|R

40|$|Root-knot {{nematodes}} (RKNs), [i]Meloidogyne[/i] spp., {{are a major}} disease {{problem in}} solanaceous crops worldwide, including pepper (Capsicum spp.). Genetic control provides an economically and environmentally sustainable protection alternative to soil fumigants. In pepper, resistance to the main RKN species ([i]M. incognita[/i],[i] M. javanica[/i] and [i]M. arenaria[/i]) is conferred by the major genes (R genes) Me 1, Me 3 and N. However, RKNs are able to develop virulence, thus endangering the efficiency of R genes. Quantitative resistance (QR) against [i]Meloidogyne[/i] spp. is expected to provide an alternative to R genes, or to be combined with R genes, to increase the resistance efficiency and durability in pepper. In order to explore the ability of QR to <b>protect</b> <b>pepper</b> against RKNs, five pepper inbred lines, differing in their QR level, were tested directly, or after combination with the Me 1 and Me 3 genes, for their resistance to a panel of[i] M. arenaria, M. javanica[/i] and [i]M. incognita[/i] isolates. The[i] M. arenaria[/i] and [i]M. javanica[/i] isolates showed low pathogenicity to pepper, unlike the [i]M. incognita[/i] isolates. The QR, controlled by the pepper genetic background, displayed a high resistance level with {{a broad spectrum of}} action, <b>protecting</b> <b>pepper</b> against Me 3 -virulent as well as avirulent [i]M. incognita[/i] isolates. The QR was also expressed when combined with the Me 1 and Me 3 genes, but presented additive genetic effects so that heterozygous F- 1 hybrids proved less resistant than homozygous inbred lines. The discovery of this QR is expected to provide promising applications for preserving the efficiency and durability of nematode resistance...|$|R

In the present paper, {{the level of}} local and systemic protection achieved by plants induced with FOL was evaluated by quantifying the pathogen biomass and using real-time PCR. Differences {{in the amount of}} pathogen were found in stems and roots between FOL-treated and untreated plants, while pathogen biomass could not be detected in leaves of induced plants. Five defence-related genes coding for a PR- 1 protein, a β- 1, 3 -glucanase, a chitinase, a peroxidase and a sesquiterpene cyclase were up-regulated 48 h after treatment in all the tissues studied, and maximal mRNAs levels were found in leaves.

40|$|In this study, we {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} fluopicolide to inhibit Phytophthora capsici in vitro, and to control pepper Phytophthora blight in a greenhouse and pepper fields. Fluopicolide was tested on various developmental stages of P. capsici 06 - 143 (a sensitive isolate to metal-axyl) and JHAW 1 - 2 (a resistant isolate to metalaxyl). Mycelial growth and zoosporangium germination of both isolates were completely inhibited at 4. 0 µg/ml of the fungicide in vitro. The EC 50 (effective concentrations reducing 50 %) of P. capsici 06 - 143 against zoospore were 0. 219 µg/ml, while those of JHAW 1 - 2 were 3. 829 µg/ml. When fluopicolide was applied at 100 and 1, 000 µg/ml 7 days before inoculation with P. capsici 06 - 143 in the greenhouse test, the disease was controlled com-pletely until 6 days after inoculation. However, the curative effect of fluopicolide was {{not as much as}} the protective effect. When fluopicolide was applied by both soil drenching and foliar spraying, the treatments strongly <b>protected</b> <b>pepper</b> against the Phytophthora blight disease. Based on these results, fluopicolide can be a promising candidate for a fungicide to control P. capsici in the pepper fields...|$|R

(Just Another Rather Very Intelligent System) was {{introduced}} in the comic books as the program that helps operate Pepper Pottss Rescue suit. When Iron Man has been incapacitated, J.A.R.V.I.S. encourages Pepper to assume the Rescue armor which Pepper does. When Rescue is chasing Iron Man throughout the city, J.A.R.V.I.S. tells Rescue to break off the chase and tells Rescue to remove the boot from Iron Man, which shows Pepper that War Machine isnt dead. When Pepper discusses thoughts about Iron Man keeping everyone on a need-to-know basis with Carson Wyche, the two confront J.A.R.V.I.S. about this. J.A.R.V.I.S. warns the two against asking any more questions and prepares to defend himself. Having captured Pepper and Wyche, J.A.R.V.I.S. declares his diagnostics do not reveal that he is compromised. He is rather in love with Pepper and wants to <b>protect</b> <b>Pepper.</b> Just then, Iron Man breaks through the wall and takes J.A.R.V.I.S. and the Rescue suit out with a source-focused electromagnetic pulse. Pepper shows J.A.R.V.I.S. how he has been sending data to an IP address in China. He seems flustered, confused, Pepper thanks him for what he has given, and powers up the coil, killing J.A.R.V.I.S.

40|$|The {{ability of}} acibenzolar-S-methyl to induce {{resistance}} in pepper plants against Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria {{was investigated in}} both growth chamber and open field conditions. Growth chamber experiments showed that acibenzolar-S-methyl (300 µM) treatment <b>protects</b> <b>pepper</b> plants systemically and locally against X. campestris pv. vesicatoria. Evidence for this was {{a reduction in the}} number and diameter of bacterial spots and bacterial growth in planta. Systemic protection was also exerted by the acibenzolar-S-methyl acid derivative, CGA 210007, which may be produced by hydrolysis in the plant. The efficacy of acibenzolar-S-methyl was also found in open field conditions, where both leaves and fruit were protected from the disease. The highest efficacy (about 67 %) was obtained by spraying the plants 6 – 7 times every 8 – 12 days with a mixture of acibenzolar-S-methyl and copper hydroxide (2. 5 + 40 g hl− 1 active ingredient). Persistence and translocation data obtained from the growth chamber experiments revealed a persistence of acibenzolar-S-methyl lasting five days after treatment with rapid translocation and negligible levels of acid derivative formation. Since the protection exerted by acibenzolar-S-methyl against bacterial spot disease was observed when the inducer was completely degraded, it would appear to be due to SAR activation...|$|R
