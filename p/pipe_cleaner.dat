25|$|In the 1980s, Wint-O-Green Life Savers {{were used}} to create soda geysers. The tubes of candies were {{threaded}} onto a <b>pipe</b> <b>cleaner</b> and dropped into the soft drink to create a geyser. At {{the end of the}} 1990s, the manufacturer of Wintergreen Lifesavers increased the size of the mints and they no longer fit in the mouth of soda bottles. Science teachers found that Mint Mentos candies had the same effect when dropped into a bottle of any carbonated soft drink.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>pipe</b> <b>cleaner</b> {{is made of}} two {{lengths of}} wire, called the core, twisted {{together}} trapping short lengths of fibre between them, called the pile. Pipe cleaners are usually made two at a time, as the inner wires of each <b>pipe</b> <b>cleaner</b> have the yarn wrapped around them, making a coil, the outer wires trap the wraps of yarn, which are then cut, making the tufts. Chenille yarn is made {{in much the same}} way, which is why craft pipe cleaners are often called [...] "chenille stems". The word chenille comes from French meaning caterpillar. Some <b>pipe</b> <b>cleaner</b> machines are actually converted chenille machines. Some machines produce very long pipe cleaners which are wound onto spools. The spools may be sold as-is or cut to length depending on the intended use. Other machines cut the pipe cleaners to length as they come off the machines. Smoking pipe cleaners are usually 15 - 17 cm (6 - 7 inches) long. Craft ones are often 30 cm (12 inches) and can be up to 50 cm (20 inches).The diameter comes in 4 mm; 6 mm; and 15 mm sizes Jumbo pipe cleaners have a 30 mm diameter with lengths of 18 inches and 6.5 feet.|$|E

50|$|Smoking <b>pipe</b> <b>cleaners</b> {{normally}} {{use some}} absorbent material, usually cotton or sometimes viscose. Bristles of stiffer material, normally monofilament nylon or polypropylene are sometimes added to better scrub {{out what is}} being cleaned. Microfilament polyester is used in some technical <b>pipe</b> <b>cleaners</b> because polyester wicks liquid away rather than absorbing it as cotton does. Some smoking <b>pipe</b> <b>cleaners</b> are made conical or tapered so that one end is thick and one end thin. The thin end is for cleaning the small bore of the pipe stem and then the thick end for the bowl or the wider part of the stem. When used for cleaning purposes, <b>pipe</b> <b>cleaners</b> are normally discarded after one or two uses.|$|R

50|$|A <b>pipe</b> <b>cleaner</b> {{can be used}} to dry out {{the bowl}} and, wetted with alcohol, the inner channel. The bowl of the pipe can also become uncomfortably hot, {{depending}} on the material and the rate of smoking. For this reason, clay pipes in particular are often held by the stem. Meerschaum pipes are held in a square of chamois leather, with gloves, or else by the stem in order to prevent uneven coloring of the material.|$|E

50|$|Smoking a pipe {{requires}} more apparatus and technique than cigarette or even cigar smoking. In {{addition to the}} pipe itself and matches or a pipe lighter, smokers usually require a pipe tool for packing, adjusting, and emptying the tobacco in the bowl, and a regular supply of <b>pipe</b> <b>cleaners.</b>|$|R
50|$|The ash and {{the last}} bits of {{unburned}} tobacco, known as dottle, should be cleaned out with a suitable pipe tool. A soft or bristle <b>pipe</b> <b>cleaner,</b> which may be moistened with strong spirits is then run through the airways of the stem and shank to remove any moisture, ash, and other residue before the pipe is allowed to dry. A pipe {{should be allowed to}} cool before removing the stem to avoid the possibility of warping it.|$|E

With its tiny 2 cm (0.787-inch) blade and boxwood handle, {{it was meant}} to be attached to a key fob or watch chain and used as a tobacco <b>pipe</b> <b>cleaner</b> or nail cleaner, but was judged to be too small. The No. 11 Opinel was discontinued in 1935, its size being considered too similar to Opinels Nos. 10 and 12.|$|E
50|$|Cake is {{considered}} undesirable in meerschaum pipes {{because it can}} easily crack the bowl and/or interfere with the mineral's natural porosity.

5000|$|In Forgotten Voices of the Great War, Demuth {{is quoted}} as saying:"Almost the last feather I {{received}} was on a bus. I was sitting near the door when I became aware of two women {{on the other side}} talking at me, and I thought to myself, 'Oh Lord, here we go again'. One lent forward and produced a feather and said, 'Here's a gift for a brave soldier. I took it and said,'Thankyou very much- I wanted one of those.' Then I took my pipe out of my pocket and put this feather down the stem and worked it in a way I've never worked a <b>pipe</b> <b>cleaner</b> before. When it was filthy I pulled it out and said, 'You know, we didn't get these in the trenches', and handed it back to her. She instinctively put out her hand and took it, so there she was sitting with this filthy <b>pipe</b> <b>cleaner</b> in her hand and all the other people on the bus began to get indignant. Then she dropped it and got up to get out, but we were nowhere near a stopping place and the bus went on quite a long way while she got well and truly barracked {{by the rest of the}} people on the bus. I sat back and laughed like mad." ...|$|E
50|$|A <b>pipe</b> <b>cleaner</b> or {{chenille}} stem {{is a type}} {{of brush}} originally intended for removing moisture and residue from smoking pipes. Besides cleaning pipes, they can be used for any application that calls for cleaning out small bores or tight places. Special pipe cleaners are manufactured specifically for cleaning out medical apparatus and for engineering applications. They are popular for winding around bottle necks to catch drips, bundling things together, colour-coding, and applying paints, oils, solvents, greases, and similar substances. They can also be used like a twist tie as a convenient way to tie something.|$|E

50|$|The soft, fuzzy {{surface of}} {{chenille}} yarns, which resemble <b>pipe</b> <b>cleaners</b> in appearance, {{can be created}} in several ways. Most commonly, a fabric is first produced and then cut into narrow strips resembling a yarn. Then, when the fabric is cut, the raw edges become very fuzzy and produce the chenille appearance. Other chenilles are created by trimming a loosely attached effect fiber to create the fuzzy appearance. Still other chenilles are created by attaching or gluing fibers to the yarn.|$|R
5000|$|The {{part where}} a <b>pipe</b> <b>cleaner</b> {{sticks his head}} in a dirty pipe and comes out looking and singing like Cab Calloway was cut on The Merrie Melodies Show and Cartoon Network. It was left uncut in the early 1990s on Nickelodeon, but by the mid-to-late 1990s, the scene was edited out, though in the {{flashback}} after the [...] "NO SMOKING" [...] cigarette march, one can see the part that was cut on Nickelodeon (the newer, redrawn version on Cartoon Network replaces the Cab Calloway part during the montage with the Indian cigars scene that was cut when Cartoon Network aired the redrawn version of this cartoon).|$|E
50|$|Cleaning is {{performed}} usually by rinsing {{with the same}} (non-deuterated) solvent used to dissolve the initial sample. Dichloromethane or acetone are good choices because dichloromethane is similar in polarity to chloroform, a common NMR solvent, while acetone dissolves many organic compounds. Sonication and scrubbing with a <b>pipe</b> <b>cleaner</b> may be helpful in removing traces of solid contaminants. If necessary, the tube may be filled with an oxidizing solution of aqua regia or piranha solution (H2O2/H2SO4). Care should be taken with these solutions, as they can unexpectedly and violently erupt from the NMR tube due to pressure build-up (aque regia) or explosion (piranha). Chromic acid solutions are never used, due to traces of paramagnetic chromium left behind on the tubes causing interference with NMR experiments.|$|E
5000|$|Pipe {{cleaners}} {{are commonly}} used in arts and crafts projects. [...] "Craft" [...] pipe cleaners are usually made with polyester or nylon pile and are often longer and thicker than the [...] "smoking" [...] type, and available in many different colors. Craft pipe cleaners are not very useful for cleaning purposes, because the polyester does not absorb liquids, and the thicker versions may not even fit down the stem of a normal pipe.In Japan, crafting with pipe cleaners is known as Mogol art. Its name derived from the Portuguese word Mughal for a style of weaving. Workshops in malls and schools in Japan have been led by Atushi Kitanaka on an effort to support the <b>pipe</b> <b>cleaner</b> industry. Use of pipe cleaners as an art format where animals [...] are made by twisting pipe cleaners together. They {{can also be used}} to create whiskers for an animal mask or nose.|$|E

50|$|Nigel {{started out}} as a bass player and is best known as a guitarist but should {{probably}} be described as a stringed instrument player. His signature instrument is a 7-string acoustic guitar, made by New Zealand luthier Laurie Williams. His favourite electric guitars are a Fender Telecaster and an Ibanez 7-string, both of which he uses with a variety of effects. He also plays a Yamaha 6-string steel string acoustic, acoustic and electric mandolins, a banjo and an 11-string Godin Glissentar - in effect a fretless electric oud with the same scale and size as a conventional guitar. He is also a proficient piano player and percussionist.Nigel often employs live loops in both performance and recording, using a custom effects box with a large variety of foot pedals. He plays with both fingers and a pick but also has been known to strike, pick, strum and pluck an instrument's strings with a variety of implements, including a <b>pipe</b> <b>cleaner.</b>|$|E
5000|$|He was {{reportedly}} born in Africa with a surname variously spelled as Tuckson, Tockson or Toxon, {{but when he}} became a favorite of the king, the monarch thought the name Panzio more exotic and fitting for him. It is unknown how he arrived in Sweden. In 1857, he was in Fristad, and was apparently in service of the regimental officer in the Älvsborg regiment before he was introduced by the officer to Prince August, Duke of Dalarna, who took him in service in 1858 and in turn introduced him to Charles XV in 1860. Officially, he was given the title secondary valet and official <b>pipe</b> <b>cleaner</b> to the king, in reality he was a favorite just as the Armenian Ohan Demirgian, and their presence at court was seen as scandalous. In 1866, he was formally fired, officially for having stolen cigars from the king, unofficially there had reportedly been complaints from the ladies-in-waiting of sexual harassment, but he remained nonetheless, always visible positioned behind the king at dinners. After the death of the king in 1872, he worked at a bath house.|$|E

5000|$|A tobacconist, {{also called}} a tobacco shop or smoke shop, is a {{retailer}} of tobacco products {{in various forms}} and the related accoutrements, such as pipes, lighters, matches, <b>pipe</b> <b>cleaners,</b> <b>pipe</b> tampers. More specialized retailers may sell ashtrays, humidification devices, hygrometers, humidors, cigar cutters, and more. Books and magazines, especially ones related to tobacco are commonly offered. Items irrelevant to tobacco such as puzzles, games, figurines, hip flasks, canes or other walking sticks, and candy are sometimes sold. In the USA, a tobacconist shop is traditionally represented by a wooden Indian positioned nearby. Most retailers of tobacco sell other types of product; today supermarkets, in many countries with a special counter, are usually the main sellers of the common brands of cigarette. In the United Kingdom, a common combination in small shops has been a newsagent selling newspapers and magazines, as well as confectionery and tobacco. In UK retailing this sector is known as [...] "CONTOB" [...] ("confectionery and tobacco").|$|R
