40|$|SummaryThe iron-induced {{model of}} <b>post-traumatic</b> chronic focal <b>epilepsy</b> in rats was studied by depth-electrode mapping to {{investigate}} the spread of epileptiform activity into subcortical brain structures after its onset in the cortical epileptic focus. Electrical seizure activity was recorded in the hippocampal CA 1 and CA 3 areas, amygdala and caudate-putamen, in rats with iron-induced chronic cortical focal epilepsy. These experiments showed that the epileptiform activity with its onset in the cortical focus synchronously propagated into the studied subcortical brain areas. Seizure behaviours seemed to increase in correspondence with {{the spread of the}} epileptic electrographic activity in subcortical areas. Comparison of the cortical focus electroencephalographic and associated multiple-unit action potential recordings with those from the subcortical structures showed that the occurrence and evolution of the epileptiform activity in the subcortical structures were in parallel with that in the cortical focus. The intracerebral anatomic progression and delineation of seizure spread (mapped by field potential (EEG) and multiple-unit action potentials (MUA) recordings) indicated participation of these regions in the generalization of seizure activity in this model of epilepsy. The seizure-induced activation of the hippocampus appeared to evolve into an epileptic focus independent of the cortical focus. The present study demonstrates the propagation of epileptic activity from the cortical focus into the limbic and basal ganglia regions. Treatment of iron-induced epileptic rats with ethosuximide, an anti-absence drug, resulted in suppression of the epileptiform activity in the cortical focus {{as well as in the}} subcortical brain areas...|$|R
40|$|The ionotropic {{glutamate}} receptors (GluR) are {{the primary}} mediators of excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain. GluR agonist binding has been localized to an extracellular domain whose core is homologous to the bacterial periplasmic binding proteins (PBP). We have established routine, baculovirus-mediated expression of a complete ligand-binding domain construct at the 10 -L scale, yielding 10 - 40 milligrams of purified protein. This construct contains peptides that lie outside the PBP-homologous core and that connect the domain core to the transmembrane domains of the channel and to the N-terminal X-domain. These linker peptides have been implicated in modulating channel physiology. Such extended constructs have proven difficult to express in bacteria, but the protein described here is stable and monomeric. Isothermal titration calorimetry reveals that glutamate binding to the domain involves a substantial heat capacity change and that at physiological temperatures, the reaction is both entropically and enthalpically favorable. Glutamate receptor ion channels (GluR) are responsible for most excitatory synaptic communication in the central nervous system. They {{play an important role}} in the regulation of synaptic strength and are involved in a number of neuropathological processes, including <b>post-traumatic</b> neuronal damage, <b>epilepsy</b> and neurodegenerative diseases. GluR can be divided into three subclasses based on their pharmacological selectivity for the agonists alpha-amino- 5 -methyl- 3 -hydroxy- 4 -isoxazole propionate (AMPA), kainate and N-methyl- d-aspartate (NMDA) (reviewed in [1]).

40|$|SummaryIntroductionLevetiracetam (LEV) is {{approved}} {{for use as}} add-on therapy in adult patients with partial epilepsy. It is apparent from clinical trials that up to 8 % of previously drug-resistant patients may be rendered seizure-free by adding-on levetiracteam. As {{yet there is no}} way of predicting these unexpectedly responsive patients. We set out to identify our previously refractory patients who had demonstrated unexpected responsiveness to add-on therapy with levetiracetam, and compared these to patients who had not responded to the drug. We then attempted to characterise any clinical features that differentiated these groups of patients. MethodsWe included all patients with a history of present or previous exposure to levetiracetam who had been unresponsive to at least two other prior anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) and recorded their demographic and clinical data. We divided response into (a) ‘seizure-free’ (seizure-free for a minimum of 6 months after commencing LEV); (b) ‘partial > 50 %’ (greater than 50 % reduction in seizures for a minimum of 6 months after commencing LEV); (c) ‘honeymoon’ (seizure-free for less than 6 months after commencing LEV and then returned towards baseline frequency); and (d) ‘no-response’. For the purpose of analysis we considered the ‘seizure-free’ and ‘partial > 50 %’ groups as ‘responders’, and the ‘no response’ group as ‘non responders’. Results 344 patients were included in the analysis. Fifty-six patients (16. 3 %) were rendered seizure-free on levetiracetam. Idiopathic generalised <b>epilepsy</b> and <b>post-traumatic</b> partial <b>epilepsy</b> were more common in the responder than the non-responder group (p= 0. 005 and 0. 05 respectively). Lamotrigine was used significantly more often in combination with levetiracetam in responders than non-responders (p= 0. 003). The mean daily dose of levetiracetam was lower in responders than non-responders. DiscussionA higher than expected number of previously drug-resistant patients was rendered seizure-free by add-on therapy with levetiracetam. Those who respond best appear to do so at relatively low doses and our data suggest the possibility of a beneficial pharmacodynamic interaction between levetiracetam and lamotrigine. We were unable to identify any clinical factors that clearly predicted which patients would become seizure-free and we hypothesise that response may be determined by genetic or molecular factors. All drug-resistant patients, including those being assessed for surgery, should be considered for a trial of levetiracetam, regardless of their epilepsy classification...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPost-traumatic {{epilepsy}} {{continues to}} be a major concern for those experiencing traumatic brain injury. <b>Post-traumatic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> accounts for 10 – 20 % of epilepsy cases in the general population. While seizure prophylaxis can prevent early onset seizures, no available treatments effectively prevent late-onset seizure. Little is known about the progression of neural injury over time and how this injury progression contributes to late onset seizure development. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the epidemiology and risk factors for <b>post-traumatic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> and the current pharmacologic agents used for treatment. We highlight limitations with the current approach and offer suggestions for remedying the knowledge gap. Critical to this pursuit is the design of pre-clinical models to investigate important mechanistic factors responsible for <b>post-traumatic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> development. We discuss what the current models have provided in terms of understanding acute injury and what is needed to advance understanding regarding late onset seizure. New model designs will be used to investigate novel pathways linking acute injury to chronic changes within the brain. Important components of this transition are likely mediated by toll-like receptors, neuroinflammation, and tauopathy. In the final section, we highlight current experimental therapies that may prove promising in preventing and treating <b>post-traumatic</b> <b>epilepsy.</b> By increasing understanding about <b>post-traumatic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> and injury expansion over time, {{it will be possible to}} design better treatments with specific molecular targets to prevent late-onset seizure occurrence following traumatic brain injury...|$|E

There have been few recent studies analysing the overall outcomes including early complications of depressed skull fractures.

METHODS: We reviewed case notes of 73 consecutive surgically treated depressed skull fractures during the period from 1 January 1994 to 31 December 1998 admitted to the Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Liverpool. RESULTS: There was a male preponderance of 9 : 1. Alleged assault was {{the most common cause of}} depressed skull fractures followed by road traffic accidents. Postoperative infection rate was 8. 2 %. More than 80 % of patients received prophylactic antibiotics.

Therefore, it is possible that epileptogenesis in organotypic cultures is driven by these components. We examined the influence of medium composition on epileptogenesis. Epileptogenesis was evaluated by measurements of lactate and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (biomarkers of ictal activity and cell death, respectively) in spent culture media, immunohistochemistry and automated 3 -D cell counts, and extracellular recordings from CA 3 regions. Changes in culture medium components moderately influenced lactate and LDH levels as well as electrographic seizure burden and cell death.
