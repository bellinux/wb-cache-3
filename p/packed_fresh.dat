40|$|Perishables, such as <b>packed</b> <b>fresh</b> {{food and}} {{pharmaceutical}} products (a. o. blood products), typically have a fixed shelf life set by a fixed use-by date or sell-by date. Despite their limited life time, orders in practice are usually {{based on the}} stock level irrespective of {{the ages of the}} products in stock. The management of inventories of such products can be improved by applying stock-age dependent ordering, issuing, and disposal policies. This paper investigates cost reductions that can be achieved by an optimal stock-age dependent ordering, issuing, or disposal policy as obtained by Stochastic Dynamic Programming. Orders are made before the uncertain demand is revealed. When demand turns out to be relatively low, a disposal policy enables to get rid of excess (old) stock. Disposal decisions are an understudied area, but may be relevant to retailers for which displaying the freshest items is of high importance. Also blood banks prefer not to issue products that are about to expire as transfusion of younger blood products is more effective. This paper fills a research gap identified in Karaesmen et al. (2011) : the paper appears {{to be the first to}} report optimal stock-age dependent disposal decisions, both under a base stock policy and under optimal stock-age dependent ordering. Results of optimal stock-age dependent ordering, disposal, and issuance are compared to a base stock policy, which is commonly used in practice. Under FIFO issuance, the added value of an optimal disposal policy is high. An optimal disposal policy in combination with optimal ordering reduces the average costs only when issuing old products is penalized, e. g. by selling at a discounted price. Under LIFO issuance, an optimal disposal policy has significant impact when orders are set by a BSP, but not under optimal stock-age dependent ordering. When no penalty or discount applies, disposals reduce costs only in case of suboptimal ordering, e. g. by a BSP...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the role of the package as an information resource in a supply chain context. The package is a physical resource that is designed in accordance with principles of packaging technology. This study concentrates on the package regarded as a logistics resource. This role of the package involves functions regarding how packages carry goods, provide utility in relation to logistics activities, and facilitate communication. In this study focus is directed to communicative aspects of using packages. Within logistics and supply chain management studies regarding using packages have mainly been directed towards how packages carry goods. In a supply chain the package may be therefore be regarded as a core logistics resource since it facilitates the provision of products to an end user. This view is also based upon that when goods are packed, the goods themselves are concealed, and therefore it is packages, and not the goods themselves that need to be accounted for. In addition, packages serve a vital purpose as a marketing resource in a retail setting and when informing about products in a purchasing situation. The use of the package as an information resource is described as an interplay between, the package, information and the transformation of goods. This interplay is used to structure the frame of reference and to design the research process. Empirical findings are based on four cases concerning the distribution of four fresh food products to Norwegian retailers. The studied products are 1) seasonal strawberries, 2) low-fat milk, 3) <b>packed</b> <b>fresh</b> fish, and 4) bananas from Costa Rica. These four products are studied in the supply chains of two Norwegian distribution networks; 1) BAMA, a distributor of fresh fruits and vegetables, and 2) TINE, a producer and distributor of predominately dairy products. In a supply chain consisting of different actors, informational needs vary. Descriptions of packages impact on how information is provided and used for different purposes. The main findings of this study involve how the package through playing a vital role embedded in the core flow of goods facilitates information exchange and the transformation of information about goods adapted to user needs. The package is a logistics resource that mediates between variations in actor needs and different logistics activities in a network of supply chain actors...|$|E

40|$|Background Foods {{are prone}} to quality {{degradation}} in the whole supply chain, but the possibilities for monitoring the quality of foods inside the package are limited. When sensors of quality indicators are included into the package of a food, the package can become an intelligent packaging that is able to communicate information about the packed food. An intelligent packaging {{could be used to}} monitor quality attributes of the food and translate this into a message {{about the quality of the}} packed food that is communicated to all actors in the supply chain. Knowledge of the quality status of the food could lead to improvements in quality based logistic decision making in the food chain and reduce food waste. In this thesis the possibilities and pitfalls to use intelligent packaging to monitor the quality of foods were explored.   Aim of this thesis The objective of this thesis was to study and develop an intelligent packaging concept that can monitor and predict food quality within the supply chain. Intelligent packaging systems, based on a direct or indirect quality monitoring sensor and combined with mathematical models, were evaluated on their abilities to predict the quality of the packed perishable foods under different conditions that can occur in the supply chain. The development of new non-destructive methods for monitoring changes in the freshness status of <b>packed</b> <b>fresh</b> fish was chosen as a case study for the proof of principle of the application of intelligent packaging for monitoring food quality.   Results First, a literature study was performed on the possibilities for intelligent packaging for monitoring the quality of foods (chapter 2). One of the conclusions was that foods that benefit the most from intelligent packaging are expensive, highly perishable foods. Foods with a known or low variation in initial quality can benefit from sensors that monitor the environmental conditions surrounding the food that influence the quality of the packed foods. Foods with an unknown or high variation in the initial quality need sensors that directly monitor a quality attribute of the food itself. The initial quality of fresh fish is highly variable and therefore fresh cod fillets require sensors monitoring compounds correlated with the quality of the fish. Therefore, fresh cod was chosen as case example for the development of a quality sensor for intelligent packaging. The content of total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) compounds were identified as possible quality indicator compounds to predict the freshness of fish, the most important quality attribute of fresh fish...|$|E

40|$|Research PaperThe main {{research}} question {{in this paper}} is: What impacts do the perceived structural changes in (1) consumer demand for fresh quality and (2) mobility (trade) barriers in distribution have {{on the market and}} trade patterns for <b>fresh</b> <b>packed</b> consumer fish products? A representative sample of UK and French seafood supermarket buyers, importers and wholesale distributors were interviewed about their perceptions of {{the answers to these questions}} and the data collected were subjected to statistical analysis. The results show that processors with access to fresh fish landings have a strong incentive to maintain the «freshness» properly as the fish move through the market channel. Indeed, the fact that they have access to fresh fish in the first place gives such processors a competitive advantage in the high quality end of the market. The results show further that market potential is perceived to be better for <b>fresh</b> <b>packed</b> fish than for traditional frozen products. The potential is higher in France than in the UK. The potential for both fresh and <b>fresh</b> frozen consumer <b>packs</b> is perceived to be strong. The potential for consumer products from frozen blocks (portion cut) is still perceived to be good in the UK, but not in France. Several barriers to increased sales of <b>fresh</b> <b>packed</b> consumer products were identified. Not surprisingly, price, and therefore consumer demand, was ranked as the primary barrier in the market. Other important factors are switching cost (i. e. costs of changing to a different supplier), uncertain quality, unsteady supply, a reluctance of suppliers to invest in sales promotion and, finally, weak personal relationships. Barriers in the raw fish market, that is, constraints at the harvest level, and lack of knowledge about the qualifications of alternative processors are also perceived to be important. These entry barriers have to be overcome by new suppliers before entry is possible...|$|R
