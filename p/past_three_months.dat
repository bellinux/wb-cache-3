5|$|Strike Back {{began as}} a six-part series from Sky1, based on a book {{of the same name}} from former Special Air Service (SAS) soldier turned novelist Chris Ryan. It {{transmitted}} two episodes weekly from 5 to 19 May 2010. The first two episodes more than tripled Sky1's audience share in its timeslot in the <b>past</b> <b>three</b> <b>months.</b> On August 2010, Sky1 controller Stuart Murphy commissioned a second series to consist of a longer run of ten episodes. Left Bank Pictures continued their role as the production company. In February 2011, it was announced that Sky entered a co-production deal with the American television network Cinemax, as the network wanted to introduce new drama series. Strike Back became one of two television projects to be produced by British and American networks in 2011, the other being , which was produced between the BBC and Starz.|$|E

[...] Members of the Association's Eastern, New England, Southern, Florida, and Texas delegations, whose chief spokesman was Gardnar Mulloy, {{were in favor of}} Savitt being named the No. 1 tennis player in the U.S. However, Frank Shields attacked Savitt in a [...] "biting", [...] "unprecedented" [...] speech, which observers said swung the vote against Savitt. As it was reported by Time magazine, [...] "the loudest talker was Frank Shields, non-playing captain of the losing U.S. Davis Cup team. Shields had ignored Savitt in the Davis Cup matches, had put his confidence in aging (30) Ted Schroeder ... {{who turned out to be}} the goat of the series. Shields was intent on keeping Savitt ranked ... at No. 3. Cried Shields: [...] 'Never once in the <b>past</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> has Savitt looked like a champion. Not only that, but he was not the most cooperative player in the world while we were in Australia, and his sounding off brought discredit to the game. He was not a credit either as a player or a representative of America.'" [...] Don McNeill, the 1940 U.S. champion, answered Shields's outburst by pointing out that players are ranked on their tennis ability, that personal prejudice should have nothing to do with ranking, and that Shields' remarks were [...] "uncalled for". [...] That met with [...] "resounding applause" [...] from the delegates. After the heated 5-hour session, one of the longest in U.S.L.T.A. history, President Russell Kingman called Shields's outburst [...] "most unseemly." [...] Australian Davis Cup team Harry Hopman called his arguments as to why Savitt should not be ranked # 1 [...] "weak". [...] Still, a never-before-required proxy vote was needed to decide the # 1 spot. Savitt was ranked the No. 2 player in the U.S. by the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association, behind Vic Seixas and directly ahead of Tony Trabert. In February 1952, a distraught Savitt announced that he would play only one more tournament, the National Indoor Championships, and then retire from tournament tennis—at age 25.|$|E
