The PARD {{for a typical}} commercial low noise power supply is - 74 dBV for frequencies above 20 Hz and is often much worse at frequencies below 20 Hz. The power supply conditioning circuit described here relies on the large differences in the dynamic impedances of a constant current diode and a zener diode to establish a dc voltage with low PARD. Power supplies with low PARD are especially important in circuitry involving ultrastable frequencies for the Deep Space Network...|$|R

We concentrate on the question whether the random walk properties depend on the spatial arrangement of the sites in the unit cell, or only on the number density of the different types of sites.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a simple {{stochastic}} model that accounts for the effects of a long-memory in volatility on option pricing. The starting point is the stochastic Black-Scholes equation involving volatility with long-range dependence. We consider the option price as a sum of classical Black-Scholes price <b>and</b> <b>random</b> <b>deviation</b> describing the risk from the random volatility. By using the fact the option price <b>and</b> <b>random</b> volatility change on different time scales, we find the asymptotic equation for the derivation involving fractional Brownian motion. The solution to this equation allows us to find the pricing bands for options. ...|$|R

40|$|A large {{class of}} {{acoustic}} noise sources has an underlying periodic process that generates a <b>periodic</b> noise component, <b>and</b> thus their acoustic noise can in general be modeled as {{the sum of}} a <b>periodic</b> signal <b>and</b> a randomly fluctuating signal (usually a broadband background noise). Active control of periodic noise (i. e., for a mixture of sinusoids) {{is more effective than}} that of random noise. For mixtures of sinusoids in a background broadband random noise, conventional FXLMS-based single filter method does not reach the maximum achievable Noise Attenuation Level (NALmax⁡). In this paper, an alternative approach is taken and the idea of a parallel active noise control (ANC) architecture for cancelling mixtures of <b>periodic</b> <b>and</b> <b>random</b> signals is presented. The proposed ANC system separates the noise into <b>periodic</b> <b>and</b> <b>random</b> components <b>and</b> generates corresponding antinoises via separate noise cancelling filters, and tends to reach NALmax⁡ consistently. The derivation of NALmax⁡ is presented. Both the separation and noise cancellation are based on adaptive filtering. Experimental results verify the analytical development by showing superior performance of the proposed method, over the single-filter approach, for several cases of sinusoids in white noise...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} project {{is based on}} previous work done by Dwight L. Jaggard and Aaron D. Jaggard on fractal ring arrays. We utilize fractals in the fabrication of a class of Cantor ring arrays. Fractal descriptors such as dimension, stage of growth, and lacunarity are applied in designing and characterizing these Cantor rings. Using the continuous arrays developed by Jaggard and Jaggard {{as a point of}} reference, we examine the design of analogous discrete arrays. We examine various ways of periodically and randomly thinning and building up these arrays azimuthally. The arrays are compared to their <b>periodic</b> <b>and</b> <b>random</b> counterparts as well as the continuous case to evaluate performance. Mainbeam quality, sidelobe level, and visible range are used to rate the arrays. The Cantor ring arrays and the corresponding array factors are simulated using programs developed in MATLAB. Our goals include developing fractal arrays that have low sidelobes comparable to those of periodic arrays while maintaining the robustness of random arrays. We aim for superior fractal performance at an equal number of elements as the <b>periodic</b> <b>and</b> <b>random</b> cases, as well as comparable performance using fewer elements...|$|R

40|$|We study {{diffusion}} in lattices with <b>periodic</b> <b>and</b> <b>random</b> {{arrangements of}} anisotropic scatterers. We show, using both analytical techniques based upon our previous work on asymptotic properties of multistate <b>random</b> walks <b>and</b> computer calculation, that the diffusion constant for the random arrangement of scatterers is bounded {{above and below}} at an arbitrary density p by the diffusion constant for an appropriately chosen periodic arrangement of scatterers at the same density. We also investigate he accuracy of the low-density expansion for the diffusion constant up to second order in the density for a lattice with randomly distributed anisotropic scatterers. Comparison of the analytical results with numerical calculations shows that {{the accuracy of the}} density expansion depends crucially on the degree of anisotropy of the scatterers. Finally, we discuss a monotonicity law for the diffusion constant with respect to variation of the transition rates, in analogy with the Rayleigh monotonicity law for the effective resistance of electric networks. As an immediate corollary we obtain that the diffusion constant, averaged over all realizations of the random arrangement of anisotropic scatterers atdensity p, is a monotone function of the density.

40|$|Nonlinear {{oscillators}} can mutually synchronize {{when they}} are driven by common external impulses. Two important scenarios are (i) synchronization resulting from phase locking of each oscillator to regular <b>periodic</b> impulses <b>and</b> (ii) noise-induced synchronization caused by Poisson random impulses, but their difference has not been fully quantified. Here we analyze a pair of uncoupled oscillators subject to common random impulses with gamma-distributed intervals, which can be smoothly interpolated between regular <b>periodic</b> <b>and</b> <b>random</b> Poisson impulses. Their dynamics are charac- terized by phase distributions, frequency detuning, Lyapunov exponents, and information-theoretic measures, which clearly reveal {{the differences between the}} two synchronization scenarios.
