Like its redwood relatives, the Big Tree has an extensive fossil record and once had a wider range than at present. Its current range appears to have been rather recently occupied, and to have been shaped by Pleistocene glaciations and <b>an</b> extensive Xerothermic <b>period</b> <b>a</b> few thousand <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> The maximum height and maximum mass of the Big Trees have been a matter of dispute, but both are exceeded by other organisms.

40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{has been}} classifiedinto 8 genotypes, from A to H {{and there are}} some hints that the outcome of the disease and the {{response}} to therapy might be correlated to these genomic groups (although not as serious as hepatitis C virus [HCV]). Hepatitis B virus genotypes show a characteristic geographic distribution with a proposed association with human migration. Several scientific fields are employed for the study of human population history, including archaeology, linguistics, anthropology and, recently, genetics. Thanks to the introduction of modern technology into genetics in the past two decades, humans have been facing some very interesting findings about their history. Besides mitochondrial DNA sequence analysis, persistent viruses have opened a new window into this area, especially HBV. But why? It is of interest that the prevalence of HBV genotypes throughout the world is clearly linked to migration. For example, the ancestors of Eskimos migrated from South East (SE) Asia to the North and passed through the Behring channel to Alaska, which partially explains why there was as high a prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity in this area as in SE Asia (1). Second, in some studies (2 - 5) from South America, genotypes E and A, which are the dominant types in Africans, were found in an area with genotype F/H dominancy. They derived from those with African descent who came into South America during the slave trading <b>period</b> <b>a</b> few hundred <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> In our own research (6) in the Pacific region (which is an endemic area with genotype C dominancy) we compared HBV surface and core genes with the ones from SE Asian patients and from international databases. The gradient of nucleotide and amino acid variations from west to east in our study were most consistent with the hypothesis of migration of Polynesian people from Southern China through Melanesia and Fiji and their radiation across the Pacific to fill the Polynesian triangle in different times. We also found an interesting association that supported the immigration history of SE Asian ancestors southwards and their colonization in the Pacific islands. D is the most prevalent and the most distributed genotype. It is found in Western populations, the Indian subcontinent, The Middle East and North of Africa. Genotype D contains 4 subgroups (D 1 t...|$|R

War is always political in nature, but the politics of the Vietnam War provided a series of distinctive complications that heralded a divergence from Australia's traditional approaches to war and remembrance. This thesis examines the origins, veracity and consequences of the veteran stereotypes. It uses a range of sources, including documents, film, and interviews to explore the experience of veterans since the war ended – and ultimately their struggle to find a suitable place in Australian history. There is a methodological focus on oral history, based on a group of veterans in the North Queensland region. The study finds that there is neither a simple nor a single explanation, but rather a series of events, decisions and outcomes accumulating over <b>a</b> <b>period</b> of time. Veteran-related issues emerged initially in the United States of America, but this does not indicate that they were purely American problems and responses. Rather, the issues were addressed there first. The relative size of the different veteran populations played an important role, with the Australian contingent smaller and more widely spread, geographically. However, some of the more extreme images emanating from the US were applied to the emerging representations in Australia. The impact of those stereotypes is complex: while they were most often a burden to veterans, they could also offer some advantages, being concurrently helpful and hurtful. This made finding a suitable identity problematic, as few veterans wanted to identify with the stereotypes, but nonetheless sometimes found themselves trapped by them. Rather than discovering the popularly perceived group of disturbed malcontents, however, the broad scope of the sources (particularly the interviews) revealed a group of men searching for an historical context into which to place their experiences both during the war and in the following years. The evidence revealed a group of average Australians who, for <b>a</b> <b>period</b> thirty <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> were asked to make the ultimate sacrifice. The interviews offered the opportunity to provide context to a difficult history, contributing not only {{to the study of the}} conflict, but to a wider Australian public memory in a country whose war stories have had so much impact...|$|R
