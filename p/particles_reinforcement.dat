The experimental density was determined by dividing the measured weight of the test sample with its volume, while the theoretical density was evaluated by using the rule of mixtures. The density of the cast composites was observed to be reduced with the increase in BLA content; however, the percent porosity did not show any significant trend with the increase in BLA content.

The calculation are based on two-dimensional model in which the Volume of Fluid (VOF), enthalpy method and the Discrete Phase Model (DPM) have been applied to describe two-phase system, solidification and behaviour of <b>reinforcement</b> <b>particles,</b> respectively. The calculations also include the method which allows to model the contact resistance at the interface between mould wall and liquid alloy. Findings: Obtained results show that the cast solidification as well as final arrangement of heterophase <b>reinforcement</b> <b>particles</b> depend on the assumed thermal boundary conditions. The appearance of the contact resistance lengthens the solidification process and extends the effect of aggregation, sedimentation and particle engulfment or pushing ahead of solidification front.

Five cutting parameters (cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut, volume fraction of <b>particles</b> <b>reinforcement</b> and type of coated insert) were performed. Two types of coating (TiB 2 and TiN/TiCN/TiN) of carbide cutting tools were employed to machine various volume fractions of AlN particles (5 %, 7 % and 10 %) reinforced to AlSi Alloy MMC under dry cutting condition. The results shows that the optimum levels for minimum surface roughness are; A 1 (single coating of insert), B 3 (cutting speed: 250 m/min), C 2 (feed rate: 0. 75 mm/tooth), D 1 (axial depth: 0. 6 mm) and E 1 (5 % reinforcement). Surface roughness value increases along with increase in volume fraction of reinforcement. Depth of cut is more significant than feed rate and cutting speed in obtaining lower surface roughness.

Wear resistance was measure using a tribometer, equipped with a chromium steel sphere of 6 mm diameter. The sphere-plate surface contact area increases with distance covered, which in the polished steel provokes exponential increments in wear values. This exponential behaviour was not observed in the enamel plates due to their greater wear resistance. The reinforcement of the enamel plates with ceramic particles increases the wear resistance. A higher percentage of ceramic reinforcement results in a greater wear resistance of the plates.

Las medidas de resistencia a la abrasión se han obtenido utilizado un tribómetro con bola de acero al cromo de 6 mm de diámetro. El aumento de la superficie de contacto bola-placa a medida que aumenta la distancia recorrida, provoca aumentos exponenciales en los desgastes en el caso del acero pulido.
