5|$|There is {{no single}} universally agreed {{definition}} of which species are livestock. Widely agreed types of livestock include cattle for beef and dairy, sheep, goats, <b>pigs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>poultry.</b> Various other species are sometimes considered livestock, such as horses, while poultry birds are sometimes excluded. In {{some parts of the}} world, livestock includes species such as buffalo, and the South American camelids, the alpaca and llama. Some authorities use much broader definitions to include fish in aquaculture, micro-livestock such as rabbits and guinea pigs, as well as insects from honey bees to crickets raised for human consumption.|$|E

40|$|Globally, {{the face}} of <b>pig</b> <b>and</b> <b>poultry</b> {{production}} is changing. The global emphasis on ethanol production has diverted significant proportions of grain away from animal production, thus increasing the cost of feed. This has forced the <b>pig</b> <b>and</b> <b>poultry</b> industries to scrutinise their production methods investigating alternative feed ingredients together with methods of improving productivity and efficiency in order to survive. This edited collection of papers is taken {{from a series of}} seminars that brought together some of the world's leading authorities in the field of <b>pig</b> <b>and</b> <b>poultry</b> nutrition <b>and</b> production. The fundamental theme is to address the interaction between nutrition and the gut ecosystem as a means to enhance health, performance and ultimately profitability. The importance of gut development and the intestinal ecosystem as a whole, and their impact on health and disease are covered in-depth. The roles of specific feed ingredients are also discussed. ‘Gut efficiency: the key ingredient in <b>pig</b> <b>and</b> <b>poultry</b> production’ is aimed at nutritionists and animal producers as well as students and researchers studying animal and applied biological sciences...|$|R

5|$|Animals {{can be kept}} {{extensively}} or intensively. Extensive systems involve animals roaming at will, {{or under}} the supervision of a herdsman, often for their protection from predators. Ranching in the Western United States involves large herds of cattle grazing widely over public and private lands. Similar cattle stations are found in South America, Australia and other places with large areas of land and low rainfall. Similar ranching systems have been used for sheep, deer, ostrich, emu, llama and alpaca. In the uplands of the United Kingdom, sheep are turned out on the fells in spring and graze the abundant mountain grasses untended, being brought to lower altitudes late in the year, with supplementary feeding being provided in winter. In rural locations, <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> <b>poultry</b> can obtain much of their nutrition from scavenging, and in African communities, hens may live for months without being fed, and still produce one or two eggs a week.|$|E
5|$|Extensively reared animals may subsist {{entirely on}} forage, but more intensively kept {{livestock}} will require energy and protein-rich foods in addition. Energy is mainly derived from cereals and cereal by-products, {{fats and oils}} and sugar-rich foods, while protein may come from fish or meat meal, milk products, legumes and other plant foods, often the by-products of vegetable oil extraction. <b>Pigs</b> <b>and</b> <b>poultry</b> are non-ruminants and unable to digest the cellulose in grass and other forages, so they are fed entirely on cereals and other high-energy foodstuffs. The ingredients for the animals' rations can be grown on the farm or can be bought, {{in the form of}} pelleted or cubed, compound foodstuffs specially formulated for the different classes of livestock, their growth stages and their specific nutritional requirements. Vitamins and minerals are added to balance the diet. Farmed fish are usually fed pelleted food.|$|E

Later, as an older boy, his chief responsibility was as a herd — first of the <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> <b>poultry</b> in the farmyard, and later of the cattle out on the veld. The same laws of custom which had preordained Jan's role as a farmer also had their beneficial aspect; Boer farmers customarily allotted their sons a share of the natural increase of the beasts under their care. As time passed Jan gradually built up a respectable holding of livestock.|$|E
40|$|After the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) crisis {{emerged in}} 1985 / 1986, all {{processed}} animal proteins (PAPs) were finally banned for use in animal feed in the European Union. To partially lift this feed ban, paths for re-introduction of PAPs from species other than ruminants e. g. <b>pig</b> <b>and</b> <b>poultry,</b> are described in the Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE) Roadmap 2. Cannibalism, however, is still not allowed. Specific detection methods for <b>pig</b> <b>and</b> <b>poultry</b> meal <b>and</b> PAPs are prerequisites for reintroduction of <b>pig</b> <b>and</b> <b>poultry</b> {{processed animal proteins}} into animal feed. Developing a sensitive PCR method that specifically detects the taxonomically diverse and therefore artificial group ‘poultry’ {{and that does not}} detect other birds at the same time is a challenge. Here, a novel TaqMan PCR method for poultry detection is presented. The specificity of the poultry method against target and non-target species has been extensively investigated. The efficiency, linearity and sensitivity was tested using dilution series of chicken, turkey, duck and goose DNA isolated from meat and autoclaved meat as a model system for PAPs...|$|R

5|$|Modern animal {{husbandry}} relies on production systems {{adapted to the}} type of land available. Subsistence farming is being superseded by intensive animal farming in the more developed parts of the world, where for example beef cattle are kept in high density feedlots, and thousands of chickens may be raised in broiler houses or batteries. On poorer soil such as in uplands, animals are often kept more extensively, and may be allowed to roam widely, foraging for themselves. Most livestock are herbivores, except for the pig which is an omnivore. Ruminants like cattle and sheep are adapted to feed on grass; they can forage outdoors, or may be fed entirely or in part on rations richer in energy and protein, such as pelleted cereals. <b>Pigs</b> <b>and</b> <b>poultry</b> cannot digest the cellulose in forage, and require cereals and other high-energy foods.|$|E

40|$|Bacteroides spp. {{have been}} {{proposed}} as indicators of fecal contamination in microbial source tracking (MST) methodologies. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop new qPCR assays that target host-specific Bacteroidal 16 S ribosomal RNA genes, to determine the source of fecal contamination in water. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to select for host-specific bands of Bacteroides associated with a fecal pollution source and later to design four qPCR host-specific assays. A set of common primers for Bacteroides spp., four different Bacteroides spp. host-associated hydrolysis probes (human, cattle, <b>pig,</b> <b>and</b> <b>poultry),</b> <b>and</b> one hydrolysis probe for the Bacteroides genus were designed. This set of qPCR assays together with other previously developed Bacteroidetes MST targets were used to analyze water samples with fecal contamination from the four sources studied. The host-specific Bacteroides qPCRs designed for human (HMprobeBac), <b>pig</b> (PGprobeBac), <b>and</b> <b>poultry</b> (PLprobeBac) were highly specific for its sources (1. 0, 0. 97, and 1. 0, respectively) although its sensitivity was lower (0. 45, 0. 50, and 0. 73, respectively).

Cottonseed meal, 1.5 {{million tons of}} which are produced in the U.S. every year, none of which is [...] suitable for humans or any other simple-stomach animals, is even cheaper than soybean meal. Historically, meat and bone meal, blood meal, and meat scraps have almost always commanded a higher price as a feed additive than oilseed meals in the U.S., so not much incentive existed to use animal products to feed ruminants. As a result, the use of animal byproduct feeds was never common, {{as it was in}} Europe. However, U.S. regulations only partially prohibited the use of animal byproducts in feed. In 1997, regulations prohibited the feeding of mammalian byproducts to ruminants such as cattle and goats. However, the byproducts of ruminants can still be legally fed to pets or other livestock, including <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> <b>poultry.</b> In addition, it is legal for ruminants to be fed byproducts from some of these animals. Because of this, some authors have suggested that under certain conditions, it is still possible for BSE incidence to increase in U.S. cattle.
