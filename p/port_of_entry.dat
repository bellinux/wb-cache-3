5|$|Galveston {{became a}} major <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> for illegal liquor from Mexico and Canada, shipped through the Caribbean and {{distributed}} from the island throughout Texas and to other destinations.

5|$|The Port of Albany–Rensselaer, {{widely known}} as the Port of Albany, is a <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> in the United States with {{facilities}} {{on both sides of}} the Hudson River in Albany and Rensselaer, New York.

5|$|During the post-Civil-War period, {{leaders such}} as George T. Ruby and Norris Wright Cuney, who headed the Texas Republican Party and {{promoted}} civil rights for freedmen, helped to dramatically improve educational and employment opportunities for blacks in Galveston and in Texas. Cuney established his own business of stevedores and a union of black dockworkers to break the white monopoly on dock jobs. Galveston was a cosmopolitan city {{and one of the}} more successful during Reconstruction; the Freedmen's Bureau was headquartered here. German families sheltered teachers from the North, and hundreds of freedmen were taught to read. Its business community promoted progress, and immigrants stayed after arriving at this <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry.</b>|$|E

5|$|To deter smuggling, Madison {{proposed}} {{a bill to}} make Norfolk the state's only legal <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry.</b> Five other ports, including Alexandria, were eventually added, but the Port Act proved unpopular despite the support of Washington.

Due to illness, Mason {{did not come to}} Richmond during the initial session, though he sent a petition, as a private citizen, to the legislature.

5|$|SR 11 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1994. Four years later, several parties, {{including}} District 11 of Caltrans, the City and County of San Diego, the San Diego Association of Governments, and Tijuana were signatories to a Letter of Intent to build the border crossing. The route {{was added to}} the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1999. In 2009, Senate Bill 1486 was passed, and the presidential permit in 2008 allowed for the border crossing to be constructed. By one year later, several alternatives were considered, in terms of constructing some or even none of the interchanges, or removing the proposed toll on the route. State funding is allocated to cover much of the $400 million cost, which does not include the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> at another $350 million. The California Transportation Commission endorsed the project in January 2012, and approved the proposed freeway route that December.|$|E
5|$|SR 905 {{begins at}} the {{intersection}} of Tocayo Avenue and Oro Vista Road in Nestor. It begins as a freeway, intersecting with I-5 at a partial cloverleaf interchange. After interchanges with Beyer Boulevard and Picador Boulevard, the freeway then intersects I-805. Following this, SR 905 veers southeast to parallel Otay Mesa Road, with interchanges at Caliente Avenue (in Pacific Gateway Park), Britannia Boulevard, and La Media Road. After La Media, the route interchanges with the SR 125 (South Bay Expressway) toll road and the SR 11 freeway, which is planned to be a toll facility that will serve a new border crossing east of Otay Mesa. Immediately after, SR 905 turns south to its final interchange at Siempre Viva Road before the route ends at the Otay Mesa <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> <b>Entry,</b> which truck traffic must use to cross the border.|$|E
