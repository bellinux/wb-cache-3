40|$|Abstract Pulsatile {{two-dimensional}} flow through asymmetric static divergent {{models of the}} human vocal folds is investigated. Included glottal divergence angles are varied between 10 and 30, with asymmetry angles between the vocal fold pairs ranging from 5 to 15. The model glottal configurations represent asymme-tries that arise during a <b>phonatory</b> <b>cycle</b> due to voice disorders. The flow is scaled to physiological values of Reynolds, Strouhal, and Euler numbers. Data are acquired in the anterior–posterior mid-plane of the vocal fold models using phase-averaged Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) acquired at ten discrete locations in a <b>phonatory</b> <b>cycle.</b> Glottal jet stability arising from the vocal fold asymmetries is investigated and compared to previously reported work for symmetric vocal fold passages. Jet stability is enhanced {{with an increase in}} the included divergence angle, and the glottal asym-metry. Concurrently, the bi-modal jet trajectory and flow unsteadiness diminishes. Consistent with previous findings, the flow attachment due to the Coanda effect occurs when the acceleration of the forcing function is zero. ...|$|E
30|$|Another {{voice quality}} {{associated}} with ageing is breathiness. Breathiness {{is thought to}} arise due to incomplete glottal closure during closed phase of the <b>phonatory</b> <b>cycle.</b> The nearly sinusoidal shape of the breathy glottal waveforms {{is responsible for the}} increase in the relative amplitude of the first harmonic [36]. Breathy signals tend to have more high frequency energy than normally phonated signal [37]. Breathy speech also tends to be less periodic, especially in the mid and high frequencies where aspiration noise is large [38].|$|E
40|$|National audienceWithin the larynx, complex {{soft tissue}} {{structures}} are caused to oscillate periodically by an airflow generated by an overpressure in the lungs. One {{of the difficulties}} encountered when studying the oscillation of the vocal folds is the inaccessibility of the human larynx. This paper describes a study using an in-vitro model of the vocal folds constructed from latex and water, which replicates basic features of the fluid-structure interactions {{that take place in}} the human larynx. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is used to gather full flow-field measurements downstream of the model vocal folds at defined phase points in the <b>phonatory</b> <b>cycle.</b> An important development of this work is the use of an optically transparent in vitro model, which allows for measurements of the speeds and vortical structures of the jet emerging from the vocal folds...|$|E
40|$|Intelligibility {{of speech}} is of {{critical}} importance in many respects. Diminished speech intelligibility causes part {{or all of the}} intended message to be lost to listeners; the outcome is frustration of speakers and listeners in the least, but impaired communication may be dangerous in some situations. Consequently, improved understanding of the factors which contribute to intelligibility of speech is of great interest in the speech community. For example, the rapid closing of the glottis in the closing phase of the <b>phonatory</b> <b>cycle</b> is generally understood to contribute favourably to the intelligibility of speech by increasing the high frequency content of the resulting speech signal. Recent experimental and numerical studies have suggested that the presence of intraglottal vortices in the closing phase of the <b>phonatory</b> <b>cycle</b> might promote rapid closing of the glottis due to the pressure gradients which arise {{in the presence of the}} vortices. To date, computational studies to assess the impact of vortex shedding within the glottis which incorporate a dynamical model of the vocal fold tissues together with a vortex advection scheme are not prevalent. In a recent computational study, an ad hoc pressure condition, of magnitude on the order of the disturbances observed in experimental work, was superimposed upon the medial vocal fold surfaces to simulate the effect of a perturbation of the pressure field. However, this approach, while it is able to quantify the effect of a perturbation of the pressure field, is not wholly satisfactory because the temporal or spatial evolution of the perturbation of the pressure field is not a consequence of a modelled physical effect or mechanism which is fundamentally related to the physics of the fluid or the fluid-structure interaction. In the present study, a two-dimensional ideal potential flow model is developed and coupled to a low-order lumped-element dynamical model of the vocal folds. Irrotational vortices are superimposed upon the glottal flow and allowed to advect through the glottis from an upstream station at a rate which ensures that they will arrive at the superior portion of the glottis in the closing phase of the <b>phonatory</b> <b>cycle,</b> when the glottis obtains its diverging configuration. This is to emulate the roll-up and shedding of intraglottal vortices occurring in the closing phase of the <b>phonatory</b> <b>cycle.</b> The vortices may be removed to compare the dynamical response of the vocal fold tissue model in the absence or presence of the intraglottal vortices. The extension of the glottal flow model to two-dimensions is important in general, not merely because it allows for the inclusion of effects which require higher spatial dimension for their description, such as advecting vortices, but the two-dimensional glottal flow model captures the salient physics of glottal flow with improved fidelity over the standard one-dimensional Bernoulli flow models which have typically been employed in studies of phonation. Additionally, the pressure field, which is unsteady in glottal flow, is determined with the unsteady Bernoulli equation; the unsteady term is found to be significant, thus, again, the model improves upon potential flow models employed to date. The surface pressure on the medial surface of the vocal folds exhibits strong deviation near the inferior and superior margins of the medial surfaces, and, because these entail longer moment arms, larger pitching moments are obtained. It is demonstrated that the mucosal wave, in the transverse motion of the vocal folds, as the cover tissues pitch about their respective nodal points, a greater amplitude of angular displacement is observed with the two-dimensional model. The resulting glottal area waveform obtains a more skewed appearance which causes it to qualitatively appear more closely akin to clinically obtained glottal waveforms despite that the simulation model is uncoupled from the acoustics of the upper vocal tract. In comparing the simulation results, the effect of the vortices is seen to be ephemeral; the vortices rapidly advect into the supraglottal space whence they impart little upstream influence. The vortex strength determines two competing effects, which entails that the vortices should have little effect upon the dynamics of the vocal folds. In particular, as the strength of the vortices increases, the magnitude of the pressure perturbation becomes more significant, however, for a given vortex spacing, the vortices will advect more rapidly into the supraglottal region thus rapidly reducing their effect; because the perturbation of the pressure field is brief, it does not impart sufficient impulse to overcome the inertia of the vocal fold tissues. Alternatively, as vortex strength decreases, the intraglottal vortices dwell in the glottal space longer, but the magnitude of the pressure perturbation is significantly diminished. Again, the modified pressure field does not impart sufficient impulse to overcome the inertia of the vocal folds, and their behaviour remains relatively unperturbed. That the glottal area waveform in its closing phase is essentially unaffected by the presence of intraglottal vortices is demonstrated within the proposed modelling framework...|$|E
40|$|Speech is {{initiated}} when {{a critical}} pressure is {{achieved in the}} lungs, forcing the vocal folds apart. As the air is pushed up the trachea and through the larynx, the resulting aerodynamic forces, coupled with the vocal fold tissue properties, excite self-sustained oscillations of the vocal folds, which {{form the basis for}} vocalized speech. Voiced speech is a complex process which involves the inter-dependency of fluid flow, tissue properties, and acoustics. The speech process becomes even more complicated by the introduction of neurogenic and structural pathologies which may disrupt vocal fold motion and alter fluid behavior and/or the acoustical response. Recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis is the most common neurogenic pathology resulting from damage to the vagus nerve which innervates all of the muscles of the larynx except the cricothyroid. Recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis usually results in the complete immobility of the damaged vocal fold. Unilateral polyps, characterized by large growths on the medial surface of the vocal folds, are a common structural pathology that most often results from misuse and abuse of the voice. ^ Flow through 7. 5 times scaled-up driven vocal fold models in a pressure-driven flow facility was investigated for both normal and pathological speech conditions over a range of physiologically relevant flow rates. The glottal jet trajectory was resolved during the divergent portions of the <b>phonatory</b> <b>cycle.</b> The glottal jet assumed a bi-modal trajectory for normal speech. Vocal fold paresis and paralysis were modeled by limiting the motion of one vocal fold wall, which resulted in a stable, stationary attachment of the flow to the impaired vocal fold wall. The presence of a unilateral polyp introduced (1) large spatial variations in the flow in both the anterior-posterior and the inferior-superior directions and (2) fluctuations in the flow separation points that were atypical compared to those found during normal vocal fold motion. ^ A theoretical solution for flow over an infinite flat plate that is translating and rotating at constant velocity in a direction normal to the freestream velocity was developed for application to intraglottal flows. The solution addresses the role of boundary conditions on flow stability. It is shown that downstream of the point of rotation, the influence of a rotating boundary acts as a favorable pressure gradient, stabilizing the flow field. A theoretical self-similarity solution was derived in the rotating reference frame for flow over the rotating and translating flat plate, allowing direct application of the solution to flow within the glottis. Reasonable agreement (∼ 5 %) between the theory and the experimental results was found. A new procedure for applying the theoretical solution to multi-mass models of speech is proposed, with comparison to the often-employed, but inappropriate, Bernoulli flow assumption. ...|$|E
