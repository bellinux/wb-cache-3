I must acquaint your Grace of what I have learnt, {{through a}} private canal, {{from the last}} {{relation}} of Mr. Gross, the Russian minister at Berlin, although I dare say it is no news to your Grace. Mr. Gross writes that, some days before the date of his letter, the Pretender's eldest son arrived at Potsdam, and had been very well received by the King of Prussia, General Keith, and his brother, the late Earl Marshal; {{and all the other}} English, Scotch, and Irish Jacobites in the Prussian service were to wait upon him. This does not at all surprise me; but Mons. Valony, the French minister, went likewise to make his compliments at a country house, hired on purpose for this young vagabond. This is all that I know as yet of this affair in general, for the Chancellor has not thought proper as yet to inform me of the particulars. However, this public, incontestable proof of the little friendship and regard the King of Prussia has for His Majesty and His Royal Family, and for the whole British nation, will, I hope, open the eyes of the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> to that Prince's monstrous faults, if any such are still left amongst us, and I doubt not but it will save His Majesty the trouble of sending Sir C.

40|$|In {{exploring}} {{the notion of}} Universal Design, the specific aim of this PhD research is to develop haptic design parameters architects can use during the design process. These parameters should enable architects to design more multisensory spaces. To this end, the research relies on the expertise of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> congenitally <b>blind,</b> because they <b>are</b> more attentive to non-visual sensorial experiences. Their expertise is mined through in-depth interviews, focus interviews and observations using photoethnography. The empirical part of the research is complemented with a theoretical study, which {{is the focus of}} this paper. The paper tries to provide insight in the concept of a multisensory space and its meaning for Universal Design. It starts with the question how we can define a multisensory space in architecture. This requires first of all a clear description of space. Bearing the aim of Universal Design in mind, we define space from a phenomenological point of view. In phenomenology, experiencing space is a bodily way of acting in the first place. This approach shows strong similarities with the spatial experience and exploration of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> congenitally <b>blind,</b> as body-centred or egocentric information is more easily available when vision is absent. Moreover, research has pointed out that blind conditions enhance spatial processing in favour of the body centred or egocentric reference system. Subsequently, this theoretical insight is illustrated and compared with excerpts from in-depth interviews with <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> congenitally <b>blind.</b> These excerpts confirm that experiencing architecture is a result of not only physical architectural features, but also conceptual, behavioural and perceptual aspects. Each characteristic is illustrated by a tangible example and their relationship is explained. status: publishe...|$|R
