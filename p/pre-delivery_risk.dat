40|$|Analyses of the {{published}} results of national surveys and specific studies, {{as well as}} of the official stillbirth statistics, consistently point to the conclusion that perinatal mortality is significantly higher in consultant obstetric hospitals than in general practitioner maternity units or at home, even after allowance has been made for the greater proportion of births in hospital at high <b>pre-delivery</b> <b>risk.</b> Unpubliched results of the British births 1970 survey, which have now become available, make possible a direct and authoritative analysis of data on the safest place of birth. Not only does this make the earlier conclusion more certain, but it confounds the doctrine that obstetric intranatal care is particularly beneficial for high <b>pre-delivery</b> <b>risk</b> births. There is no evidence from recent years that the findings of 1970 are not equally valid in the 1980 s...|$|E
40|$|James M NicholsonDepartment of Family Practice and Community Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Health System, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USAPurpose: Annual US {{national}} {{rates of}} family physicians providing maternity care are &shy;decreasing {{and rates of}} cesarean delivery are increasing. Family physicians tend to have lower cesarean delivery rates than obstetrician specialists, but this association is usually explained by an assumed lower <b>pre-delivery</b> <b>risk</b> for cesarean delivery. This study was developed to compare the estimated risk of cesarean delivery in patients of the two specialties. Methods: A retrospective cohort study within an urban teaching hospital compared 100 &shy;family-physician treated subjects to 300 subjects treated by obstetrician-specialists. Risk factors for cesarean delivery were identified, and an indirect standardization procedure {{was used to compare}} the pre- 38 week of gestation risk of cesarean delivery in the two groups. Results: The patients treated by family physicians had a projected pre- 38 week of gestation risk of cesarean delivery (17. 4 %) that was similar to the actual rate of cesarean delivery in the obstetrician-specialist group (16. 7 %). The Standardized Cesarean Delivery Ratio was 1. 04. Conclusion: Lower cesarean delivery rates provided by family physicians may not be simply due to case-mix issues. Additional studies comparing the pre-delivery estimation of cesarean delivery risk would be helpful in measuring the relative levels of obstetric risk of patients treated by different maternity-care provider types.
