5|$|Econometric {{analysis}} of DSGE models suggested that real factors sometimes affect the economy. A paper by Frank Smets and Rafael Woulters (2007) stated that monetary policy explained {{only a small}} part of the fluctuations in economic output. In new synthesis models, shocks can affect both demand and supply. The new synthesis implies that monetary <b>policy</b> <b>can</b> have a stabilizing effect on the economy, contrary to new classical theory.|$|E
5|$|Zenobia: {{the wife}} of Odaenathus was accused by the Augustan History of having {{formerly}} conspired with Maeonius, as Hairan I was her stepson {{and she could not}} accept that he was the heir to her husband instead of her own children. However, there is no suggestion in the Augustan History that Zenobia was involved in the event that saw her husband's murder; the act is attributed to Maeonius' degeneracy and jealousy. Those accounts by the Augustan History can be dismissed as fiction. The hints in modern scholarship that Zenobia had a hand in the assassination out of her desire to rule the empire and dismay with her husband's pro-Roman <b>policy</b> <b>can</b> be dismissed as there was no reversal of that policy during the first years following Odaenathus' death.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} fiscal <b>policy</b> <b>can</b> {{be limited by}} {{crowding}} out. When there is no output gap, the economy is producing at full capacity {{and there are no}} excess productive resources. If the government increases spending in this situation, the government use resources that otherwise would have been used by the private sector, so there is no increase in overall output. Some economists think that crowding out is always an issue while others do not think it is a major issue when output is depressed.|$|E

Therefore, it can be stated that universal <b>policies</b> <b>can</b> have a particular impact on certain groups. Regarding active labour market <b>policies,</b> one <b>can</b> argue in a more generalised fashion that many active labour market <b>policy</b> schemes <b>can</b> be targeted flexibly to address the employment obstacles of target groups identifiable in the national context, with age representing just one parameter among others here. In particular, ALMPs can help to make jobseekers more attractive to potential employers by reducing labour costs in the initial phase of employment or by raising productivity via skills upgrading.|$|R

25|$|This {{surprising}} result arises {{because the}} number of non-users is very large compared to the number of users; thus, the number of false positives outweighs the number of true positives. To use concrete numbers, if 1000 individuals are tested, there are expected to be 995 non-users and 5 users. From the 995 non-users, 0.01×995≃10 false positives are expected. From the 5 users, 0.99×5≈5 true positives are expected. Out of 15 positive results, only 5, about 33%, are genuine. This illustrates the importance of base rates, and how the formation of <b>policy</b> <b>can</b> be egregiously misguided if base rates are neglected.|$|E

One of the key things superpowers do, Chomsky argues, is try to organize {{the world according to}} the interests of their establishment, using military and economic means. Chomsky has repeatedly emphasized that the overall framework of US foreign <b>policy</b> <b>can</b> be explained by the domestic dominance of US business interests and a drive to secure the state capitalist system. Those interests set the political agenda and the economic goals that aim primarily at US economic dominance.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{and other}} {{scholars}} {{disagree on the}} question of whether a specifically fascist type of economic <b>policy</b> <b>can</b> be said to exist. Baker argues that there is an identifiable economic system in fascism that is distinct from those advocated by other ideologies, comprising essential characteristics that fascist nations shared. Payne, Paxton, Sternhell, et al. argue that while fascist economies share some similarities, there is no distinctive form of fascist economic organization. Feldman and Mason argue that fascism is distinguished by an absence of coherent economic ideology and an absence of serious economic thinking. They state that the decisions taken by fascist leaders cannot be explained within a logical economic framework.|$|E

In {{order to}} manage and enforce {{multiple}} heterogeneous authorization policies in distributed authorization environment, we defined the root policy specification language and its corresponding enforcing mechanism. In a root policy, the involved users and resources can be defined in coarse or finegrained. Each involved authorization policy’s storage, trust management and enforcement can be defined independently. These authorization <b>policies</b> <b>can</b> be enforced in distributed way. Policy schemas, policy subschemas and <b>policy</b> hierarchies <b>can</b> deal with complex authorization scenarios. The context constraint component makes the root policy is a context-aware authorization system. On the other hand multiple root <b>policies</b> <b>can</b> cooperate together to complete more complicated authorization tasks...|$|R

If businesses had constantly to verify the nationality or domicile of their customers and their ages, this might slow down business and, potentially, infringe privacy legislation. Hence, conflicts of public <b>policy</b> <b>can</b> emerge which complicate the choice of law decision and invite forum shopping, i.e. traders will always seek to sue infants with whom they have contracts in those states which accord priority to commercial interests, while children will seek the avoidance of liability in the courts which protect their interests.

One of the most common forms in which hackers receive private information from online “e-tailers” actually comes from an attack placed upon the site’s servers responsible for maintaining information about previous transactions. For as experts explain, these “e-tailers” are not doing nearly enough to maintain or improve their security measures. Even those sites that clearly present a privacy or security <b>policy</b> <b>can</b> be subject to hackers’ havoc as most policies only rely upon encryption technology which only apply to the actual transfer of a customer’s data. However, with this being said, most “e-tailers” have been making improvements, going as far as covering some of the credit card fees if the information’s abuse can be tracked back to the site’s servers.|$|E
25|$|Agricultural {{policy is}} the set of {{government}} decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies {{with the goal of}} achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment (including policies related to climate change, food safety and natural disasters), economic stability (including policies related to taxes), natural resources and environmental sustainability (especially water policy), research and development, and market access for domestic commodities (including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries). Agricultural <b>policy</b> <b>can</b> also touch on food quality, ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality, food security, ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs, and conservation. Policy programs can range from financial programs, such as subsidies, to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs.|$|E
