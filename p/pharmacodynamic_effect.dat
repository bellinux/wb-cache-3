5000|$|Phentermine {{has some}} {{similarity}} in its pharmacodynamics with its parent compound, amphetamine, as they both are TAAR1 agonists, where the activation of TAAR1 in monoamine neurons facilitates the efflux or, release into the synapse, of these neurochemicals; at clinically relevant doses, phentermine primarily {{acts as a}} releasing agent of norepinephrine in neurons, although, to a lesser extent, it releases dopamine and serotonin into synapses as well. [...] Phentermine may also trigger the release of monoamines from VMAT2, which is a common <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>effect</b> among substituted amphetamines. The primary mechanism of phentermine's action in treating obesity is the reduction of hunger perception, which is a cognitive process mediated primarily through several nuclei within the hypothalamus (in particular, the lateral hypothalamic nucleus, arcuate nucleus, and ventromedial nucleus).

Here the influence of this SNP on the biological effect of tacrolimus was studied. Methods: Rhodamine (Rh 123) efflux was used to study ABCB 1 activity, with or without the addition of the ABCB 1 inhibitor verapamil. Intracellular interleukin (IL) 2 production in T cells was used to measure the <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>effect</b> of tacrolimus after phorbol- 12 -myristate- 13 -acetate/ionomycin stimulation of whole blood. In addition, the ABCB 1 genotype of 36 tacrolimus-treated renal transplant patients was related to ABCB 1 activity and tacrolimus efficacy.

40|$|Alpha 2 -adrenoceptor {{agonists}} xylazine, romifidine, detomidine and, in some cases, medetomidine and dexmedetomidine, {{are fundamental}} drugs used in equine practice. There are {{situations where the}} undesirable <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>effects</b> (ataxia, prolonged sedation, bradycardia and ileus) or accidental overdose of these drugs {{may need to be}} antagonised. The α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonists tolazoline, yohimbine and atipamezole can be used to antagonise undesirable effects. However, despite being effective, α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonists are also not without undesirable <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>effects.</b> Excitement, muscle trembling and triggered inappropriate stress responses {{are a few of the}} more serious undesirable effects. Horses demonstrate a variable response to the antagonists thus recommending dose rates become fraught with difficulty. It is therefore recommended that the α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist should be titrated to the desired clinical effect. Consequently, other reversal agents, such as anticholinergics (atropine, glycopyrrolate and hyoscine), have been administered for the treatment of α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist-induced bradycardia. Anticholinergics cannot be recommended for routine use in horses due to the undesirable cardiovascular effects and potentiation of α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility. Novel peripheral acting α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonists, such as MK- 467, are currently under scrutiny in veterinary anaesthesia in an effort to antagonise the undesirable effects of α 2 -adrenoceptor agonists without compromising on the level of sedation.

In this study, the authors attempted to evaluate the <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>effects</b> of CDDP in vitro in terms of cell survival and DNA crosslinking by simulating unbound CDDP administration at varying concentrations to a rat mammary adenocarcinoma line (known as line 66). CDDP exposure was conducted by both constant concentration procedures and a simulated in vivo procedure. Colony formation assay for the surviving fraction and alkaline elution assay for DNA crosslink measurement were performed in order to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of CDDP. Cell survival was {{a function of the}} area under the drug concentration time curve (AUC) of unbound CDDP (R 2 = 0. 77, P &# 60; 0. 002) for all drug exposure procedures as analyzed by the analysis of covariance test.

Both the total amount of DNA-DNA crosslinks and the DNA-protein crosslinks, of which the latter were dominant, were affected not by the exposure procedures, but by the AUC value (P &# 60; 0. 002).

The primary objective {{of this study was}} to select surrogate tissue to measure messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of Hh pathway genes for measurement of <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>effect.</b> Expression of Hh pathway specific genes was measured by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and global gene expression using Affymetrix U 133 microarrays. Correlations were made between the expression of specific genes determined by qRT-PCR and normalized microarray data. Gene ontology analysis using microarray data for a broader set of Hh pathway genes was performed to identify additional Hh pathway-related markers in the surrogate tissue. RNA extracted from blood, hair follicle, and skin obtained from healthy subjects was analyzed by qRT-PCR for 31 genes, whereas 8 samples were analyzed for a 7 -gene subset. Twelve sample sets, each with ≤ 500 ng total RNA derived from hair, skin, and blood, were analyzed using Affymetrix U 133 microarrays. Transcripts for several Hh pathway genes were undetectable in blood using qRT-PCR. Skin was the most desirable matrix, followed by hair follicle. Whether processed by robust multiarray average or microarray suite 5 (MAS 5), expression patterns of individual samples showed co-clustered signals; both normalization methods were equally effective for unsupervised analysis. The MAS 5 - normalized probe sets appeared better suited for supervised analysis. This work provides the basis for selection of a surrogate tissue and an expression analysis-based approach to evaluate pathway-related genes as markers of <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>effect</b> with novel inhibitors of the Hh pathway...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Budesonide has a {{long history}} as {{intranasal}} drug, with many marketed products. Efforts should be made to demonstrate the therapeutic equivalence and safety comparability between them. Given that systemic availability significantly varies from formulations, the clinical comparability of diverse products comes to be of clinical interest and a regulatory requirement. The aim {{of the present study was}} to compare the systemic availability, <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>effect,</b> and safety of two intranasal budesonide formulations for the treatment of rhinitis. Methods Eighteen healthy volunteers participated in this randomised, controlled, crossover, clinical trial. On two separated days, subjects received a single dose of 512 μg budesonide (4 puffs per nostril) from each of the assayed devices (Budesonida nasal 64 ®, Aldo-Union, Spain and Rhinocort 64 ®, AstraZeneca, Spain). Budesonide availability was determined by the measurement of budesonide plasma concentration. The <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>effect</b> on the hypothalamic-adrenal axis was evaluated as both plasma and urine cortisol levels. Adverse events were tabulated and described. Budesonide availability between formulations was compared by the calculation of 90 %CI intervals of the ratios of the main pharmacokinetic parameters describing budesonide bioavailability. Plasma cortisol concentration-time curves were compared by means of a GLM for Repeated Measures. Urine cortisol excretion between formulations was compared through the Wilcoxon's test. Results All the enroled volunteers successfully completed the study. Pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable in terms of AUC t (2. 6 ± 1. 5 vs 2. 2 ± 0. 7), AUC i (2. 9 ± 1. 5 vs 2. 4 ± 0. 7), t max (0. 4 ± 0. 1 vs 0. 4 ± 0. 2), C max /AUC i (0. 3 ± 0. 1 vs 0. 3 ± 0. 0), and MRT (5. 0 ± 1. 4 vs 4. 5 ± 0. 6), but not in the case of C max (0. 9 ± 0. 3 vs 0. 7 ± 0. 2) and t 1 / 2 (3. 7 ± 1. 8 vs 2. 9 ± 0. 4). The pharmacodynamic effects, measured as the effect over plasma and urine cortisol, were also comparables between both formulations. No severe adverse events were reported and tolerance was comparable between formulations. Conclusion The systemic availability of intranasal budesonide was comparable for both formulations in terms of most pharmacokinetic parameters. The <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>effect</b> on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis was also similar. Side effects were scarce and equivalent between the two products. This methodology to compare different budesonide-containing devices is reliable and easy to perform, and should be recommended for similar products intented to be marketed or already on the market.
