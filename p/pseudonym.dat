Knowing the detection scheme, the attacker also knows that this attack will be detected by the fifth RSU. Consequentially, the attacker retires the previous <b>pseudonyms</b> and launches a new attack with 21 of the remaining 59 <b>pseudonyms</b> available. This process continues until all of the attackers Sybil <b>pseudonyms</b> have been exhausted.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to Faichne and Hayes being universally known as [...] "Zag" [...] and [...] "Bic" [...] respectively, Ring members and guest contributors tended to operate under {{a variety of}} <b>pseudonyms</b> (in particular when listed in sleevenotes).

5|$|Following the {{publication}} of Interview with the Vampire, while living in California, Rice wrote two historical novels, The Feast of All Saints and Cry to Heaven, along with four erotic novels (The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty, Beauty's Punishment, Beauty's Release, and Beauty's Kingdom) under the <b>pseudonym</b> A. N. Roquelaure, and two more under the <b>pseudonym</b> Anne Rampling (Exit to Eden and Belinda). Rice {{then returned to the}} vampire genre with The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of the Damned, her bestselling sequels to Interview with the Vampire.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{his time}} at the college Ketèlbey wrote lighter, mostly mandolin-based, compositions. As he still aspired to be a serious composer, he adapted the <b>pseudonym</b> Raoul Clifford in an effort to {{distance}} himself from the genre. On leaving the college he became one of its examiners in harmony. He wrote piano pieces as part of his role, and used the <b>pseudonym</b> Anton Vodorinski for the work; he subsequently used the name for more serious works, which he published with French titles.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} pirated {{versions}} of the story exist, produced by other artists and illegally distributed among fans. In 1987, such a version was completed by an artist using the <b>pseudonym</b> of Ramó Nash. Several further versions were produced by the Canadian artist Yves Rodier during the 1990s. A further version appeared in the 1990s, produced by an individual known as Regric.|$|E
40|$|Current {{standardization}} {{efforts for}} cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems {{both in the}} U. S. and Europe foresee vehicles to use {{a large number of}} changeable <b>pseudonyms</b> for privacy protection. Provisioning and storage of these pseu- donyms require efficient and secure mechanisms to prevent malicious use of <b>pseudonyms.</b> In this paper we investigate several techniques to improve secure and efficient storage of <b>pseudonyms.</b> Specifically, we propose schemes based on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) that allow to replace expensive secure key storage by regular unsecured memory and still provide fully secure <b>pseudonyms</b> storage...|$|R
40|$|Privacy-Enhancing Identity Management (PIM) enables {{users to}} control which {{personal}} information they provide to their communication partner(s) by partitioning their personal information into partial identities for themselves. Since partial identities {{must not be}} linkable, they cannot share a global name. Therefore, <b>pseudonyms</b> are used as identifiers. We discuss in this paper that besides the frequency of their use also the (re) presentation of <b>pseudonyms</b> influences the achievable privacy. Particularly, we point out that conflicting requirements on privacy and usability cannot be sufficiently considered by a single type of representation of <b>pseudonyms.</b> Hence, a PIM system should generate digital <b>pseudonyms</b> which are used for communication, while users assign local mnemonics to these <b>pseudonyms</b> {{in order to simplify}} their use. We discuss possible solutions for the support of mnemonics and, thereby, propose some improvements to privacy-enhancing identity management tools...|$|R
30|$|In [4], heavy-weight {{cryptographic}} {{techniques are}} leveraged for detecting Sybil attacks in VANETs. Specifically, each vehicle {{is given a}} list of <b>pseudonyms</b> to protect their privacy during communication. However, the <b>pseudonyms</b> of each vehicle are designed {{in such a manner}} wherein they are all hashed to a common value. By calculating the hashed values at Road Side Units, a central server can determine whether or not certain <b>pseudonyms</b> came from the same pool. Sybil attacks are detected if many <b>pseudonyms</b> from the same pool are detected in a short interval of time. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of cryptographic protocols in this technique is quite high.|$|R
5|$|As a writer, Campbell {{published}} super-science space opera {{under his}} own name and moody stories under his primary and most famous <b>pseudonym,</b> Don A. Stuart. Campbell also wrote under the pen names Karl Van Kampen and Arthur McCann. He stopped writing fiction after he became editor of Astounding.|$|E
5|$|Bantu Stephen Biko (18 December 1946– 12 September 1977) was a South African anti-apartheid activist.

His ideas were articulated {{in a series of articles}} published under the <b>pseudonym</b> Frank Talk.|$|E
5|$|Barbette began {{performing}} as an aerialist at around {{the age of}} 14 as one-half of a circus act called The Alfaretta Sisters.

While this can be debated (since Gertrude Barrows Bennett, writing under the <b>pseudonym</b> Francis Stevens, {{published}} science fiction stories as early as 1917), Harris is recognized as the first woman to publish stories in science fiction magazines under her own name.|$|E

3000|$|... (set of benign identities) {{otherwise}} the Sybil attack {{will have little}} influence on the benign vehicles. Using the previous example of Sybil nodes incorrectly reporting road conditions, if exactly 50 % of the <b>pseudonyms</b> were Sybil and reporting false information while the other 50 % (benign <b>pseudonyms)</b> are reporting true information. No decision could be made on what information to believe. Therefore, an attacker needs more than 50 % Sybil <b>pseudonyms</b> to launch an effective attack.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Anonymity on the Internet== Most {{commentary}} on the Internet is essentially done anonymously, using unidentifiable <b>pseudonyms.</b> While these usernames can take on an identity of their own, they are frequently separated and anonymous from the actual author. According to the University of Stockholm this is creating more freedom of expression, and less accountability. Wikipedia is collaboratively written mostly by authors using either unidentifiable <b>pseudonyms</b> or IP address identifiers, although a few have used identified <b>pseudonyms</b> or their real names.|$|R
50|$|The {{campaign}} {{included a}} crusade in the state-controlled mass media to expose literary <b>pseudonyms,</b> which {{were used by}} many Jews, by putting real names in parentheses.

50|$|Kierkegaard, {{known for}} his {{frequent}} use of <b>pseudonyms,</b> would publish only overtly religious works under his own name, but published his philosophical works under <b>pseudonyms.</b> Each name cultivates a different personality reflective of the overarching meaning of the work. H.H. {{was the first of}} two religious <b>pseudonyms,</b> the first being Anti-Climacus, the author of The Sickness Unto Death and Practice in Christianity. While both are religious, H.H. is less intellectually and philosophically engaged than Anti-Climacus. H.H. is also not an idealized representation of Christianity despite writing authoritatively.|$|R
