Astronomers had made careful <b>photometric</b> <b>measurements</b> of several stars known to be orbited by planets, in the hope that they might observe a dip in brightness caused by the transit of the planet across the star's face. This would require the planet's orbit to be inclined such that it would pass between the Earth and the star, and previously no transits had been detected.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of methylene blue after {{the reaction of}} hydrogen sulfide with dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine and iron(III) at pH0.4–0.7 is used to determine by <b>photometric</b> <b>measurements</b> sulfide concentration in the range 0.020 to 1.50mg/L (20ppb to 1.5ppm). The test is very sensitive and the blue coloration developing upon contact of the reagents with dissolved H2S is stable for 60min. Ready-to-use kits such as the Spectroquant sulfide test facilitate routine analyses. The methylene blue sulfide test is a convenient method often used in soil microbiology to quickly detect in water the metabolic activity of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB).

500|$|<b>Photometric</b> <b>measurements</b> of Vega {{during the}} 1930s {{appeared}} {{to show that}} the star had a low-magnitude variability on the order of ±0.03 magnitudes. This range of variability was near the limits of observational capability for that time, and so the subject of Vega's variability has been controversial. The magnitude of Vega was measured again in 1981 at the David Dunlap Observatory and showed some slight variability. Thus it was suggested that Vega showed occasional low-amplitude pulsations associated with a Delta Scuti variable. This is a category of stars that oscillate in a coherent manner, resulting in periodic pulsations in the star's luminosity. Although Vega fits the physical profile for this type of variable, other observers have found no such variation. Thus the variability was thought to possibly be the result of systematic errors in measurement. However, a 2007 article surveyed these and other results, and concluded that [...] "A conservative analysis of the foregoing results suggests that Vega is quite likely variable in the 1-2% range, with possible occasional excursions to as much as 4% from the mean". Also, a 2011 article affirms on its abstract that [...] "The long-term (year-to-year) variability of Vega was confirmed".|$|E

The milking was performed manually and the analyses took place after the refrigeration of the samples. Before executing the analyses, the samples were homogenized and soon after evaluated in terms of fat amount by three distinct methodologies: official Brazilian methodology through Gerber’s butyrometer (GB), electronic equipment of <b>photometric</b> <b>measurement</b> Milko-Tester® (MT) and ultrasound spectroscopic equipment Lactoscan 90 ® (LS), which all analyses were performed in triple.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{perspective on}} specifying a stimulus' luminosity is to measure its emitted light. Because viewing is {{the reverse of}} radiating, an alternative approach measures the light as it is received by the eye or other image sensor–incident photometry. From this perspective, I develop a method of specifying stimulus luminosity {{in terms of the}} flux incident on noncontinuous detector surfaces whose sensing units map the directional characteristics of an image. Sensing unit size determines how much of the image at its location induces its sensory response. That portion of the image is the sensing unit's receptive field. Since sensor response depends on rate of photon impingement, the appropriate <b>photometric</b> <b>measurement</b> is lumens-per-receptive-field (lm/rf). ‘lm/rf’ accounts for pupil area and can be corrected for ocular transmittance.
