Brittle cleavage modes of fracture were developed at temperatures {{as high as}} 10 and 20 oC in side-grooved CTOD specimens, that had been prepared from steel <b>pre-strained</b> by 9. 8 % or more. The CTOD three-point bend samples, SENB 3, were cut from 25 mm thick flanges of 310 UC 158 Grade 300 Plus steel column sections and were naturally aged for 11 months or more after pre-straining. The effect of natural aging was more pronounced than expected, significantly raising the tensile properties of the <b>pre-strained</b> steel. The fracture properties of the steel were also affected by the combination of pre-strain and aging. Steel that had been <b>pre-strained</b> by 4. 9 % and aged showed the greatest increase in fracture toughness, compared to as-received steel, and failed by ductile fibrous fracture at 10 oC.

In the present work, different uni-axial pre-strains of 6. 4 % and 12. 2 % were induced in AA 5754 -O aluminum alloy both along rolling direction (RD) and transverse direction (TD). The true stress-strain response, limiting dome height (LDH) and strain based forming limit diagram (ε-FLD) of as received and all <b>pre-strained</b> materials were evaluated experimentally.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the fatigue behavior of the SUS 430 Stainless Steel after the tensile pre-deformation is subjected to a symmetric loading. The investigations have been performed in three levels of pre-deformation. Cyclic deformation following pre-deformation was carried out in tension-compression fatigue test experiment at room temperature. The pre-deformation was induced on the specimen by a tensile test under strain control at 5 %, 8 %, and 12 % strain level at a strain rate of 10 − 4 s− 1, respectively. In this paper, the effects of the cyclic deformation behaviors with different <b>pre-strain</b> levels were compared with the fatigue responses without <b>pre-strain.</b> Based on the comparison, it is found that the <b>pre-strain</b> caused evident changes in fatigue behaviors such as cyclic softening response, cyclic creep response, and cycles to failure. Generally, as compared to the as-received material, the softening response increased with increasing <b>pre-strain</b> level. A pronounced cyclic compressive creep occurred in the specimen with and without <b>pre-strain</b> level effect in all applied loading cases. This could be attributed to an-isotropy between tension and compression, resulting in the occurrence of compressive cyclic creep on the tested material during cyclic loading. Moreover, the stable total compressive creep strain scaled with increasing tensile <b>pre-strain</b> level for same cyclic loading. For the effect of <b>pre-strain</b> on fatigue resistance, a decrease in the number of cycles to failure was observed and the extent of the decrease also increased with increasing tensile <b>pre-strain</b> level under the same loading amplitude condition. In this paper, three damage parameters, ΔWp, Wf, and σaεa, are respectively used to predict the number of cycles to failure of the tested material with tensile <b>pre-strain</b> effect.

The failure pressure of defective was estimated for the pipe with {{the different types of}} defects. APIX 42 steel is chosen for this studies and it must undergoes few machining steps to design a tensile test specimen according to ASTM E 8 - 08 M- 11. Data obtained from tension test (engineering stress strain) must convert into true stress strain in order to transfer it during simulation (field). Power law is the formula used to convert engineering stress strain to true stress strain. Ultimate strength of APIX 42 is predicted at 612 MPa. For modelling part, one quarter of pipeline geometry need to design in MSCPatran software. This study is only focussed on single type of defect. Meshing (element) steps continues after one quarter of geometry is designed. Modelling and simulation is repeated for the different depth (25 %, 50 % and 75 %) of defects and increment in <b>pre-strain.</b> Result obtained after the simulation process must be interpolated to get more accurate failure pressure. Predicted failure pressure is higher for pipeline without presence of <b>pre-strain.</b> Pipeline with the presence of <b>pre-strain,</b> predicted failure pressure is reducing as the amount of <b>pre-strain</b> applied is increases. Three industry models are compared with the finite element result (FEA) for validation. For the lower depth, FEA failure prediction is the highest followed by DNV-RP-F 101. ASME B 31 G and Modified B 31 G predicted almost same failure pressure but less than FEA and DNV-RPF 101.

These are commonly made from medium carbon steels (~ 0. 55 wt. % C) heat treated to a near pearlitic microstructure with some 5 – 10 % pro-eutectoid ferrite. The two steel grades studied here are very common on trains in Europe: the R 7 T grade is mainly used for freight trains and the R 8 T grade is mostly used for motorized passenger trains. During operation of trains, high thermal loads are evolved because of recurring acceleration, braking, curving and occasional slippage. It is thus relevant to examine the high temperature performance of wheel material and evaluate the decrease in strength after thermal exposure {{as well as the}} degradation of fatigue properties. Samples were extracted from virgin wheels and <b>pre-strained</b> to around 6. 5 % strain, to also account for the change in properties that is induced by plastic deformation inherent in the wheel tread surface. Both un-deformed and <b>pre-strained</b> material was heat treated for different times in the temperature range of interest, from 250 °C to 700 °C. Hardening was observed in both conditions around 300 °C followed by softening at higher temperatures. Spheroidization of the pearlite started to become visible at 450 °C for the un-deformed material and at around 400 °C for the <b>pre-strained...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a new {{fatigue limit}} {{estimation}} scheme for {{austenitic stainless steel}} based on the dissipated energy is proposed. The new scheme utilizes the phase 2 f lock-in infrared method which is a technique for improving the accuracy of a dissipated energy measurement, and evaluates the fatigue limit based on the increasing rate of dissipated energy. This scheme {{is applied to the}} <b>pre-strained</b> austenitic stainless steel specimen. The fatigue limit of austenitic stainless steel specimen is increased by the plastic forming process. The phase 2 f lock-in infrared method can remove the apparent dissipated energy which is caused by thermoelastic temperature change due to harmonic vibration of fatigue testing machine. The estimation scheme based on the increasing rate of dissipated energy against the stress level can evaluate the fatigue limit of the <b>pre-strained</b> specimen with greater accuracy than the conventional scheme...|$|E

The result shows that yield strength and tensile strength of X 100 line pipe would increase significantly {{with the introduction of}} <b>pre-strain,</b> while the impact toughness would decrease significantly. Effect of strain aging on tensile properties of X 100 line pipe are more significantly. The yield strength, and tensile strength would increase significantly with the introduction of strain aging both transversal and longitudinal direction...|$|R
40|$|The {{uniaxial}} {{mechanical properties}} of a NiTi fibre/Al matrix smart composite are studied. An one-dimensional model {{is used to}} compute the yield stress and Young's modulus of the smart composite under different fraction of fibres and <b>pre-strain.</b> The theoretical results are compared with the experimental data of Furuya et al. and there is good agreement. The effects of fraction of fibres and <b>pre-strain</b> on the yield strength and Young's modulus of the composite have also been investigated. It is found {{that the effect of}} <b>pre-strain</b> on the mechanical properties of the composites is small. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
