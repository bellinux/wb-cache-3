40|$|Evaluating the {{adaptive}} significance of genetic enzyme polymorphisms remains a controversial issue in evolutionary biology. One model, based on metabolic control theory, assumes that if fitness and pathway flux covary and are both maximized a hyperbolic function relates fitness to single-step activity changes. The model predicts that large activity increases will negligibly affect fitness/flux compared to large decreases. Consequently, most allozymes occupy the plateau of this function and are selectively neutral. Evidence supporting this {{model has been}} obtained using the wild-type fully-induced state as the activity maximum. I report an experimental system that circumvents this limitation and tests the model more rigorously. ^ DNA fragments complementing lesions in glycolysis were overexpressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae on high-copy plasmids. These included: hexokinaseB, <b>phosphoglucose-isomerase,</b> phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase. Activities ranged from four- to ten-fold over either wild-type or wild-type transformed with vector only. Biochemical, physiological, and fitness parameters were measured in exponential and stationary-phase batch cultures. These included: levels of certain glycolytic intermediates, glucose conversion to ethanol and glycogen, yield biomass in dry mass and protein, maximum growth rate, stationary-phase density, heat-shock sensitivity and sporulation efficiency. ^ Intermediate pools during exponential phase, flux to ethanol, yield biomass, and heat-shock sensitivity do not vary significantly among treatments and controls. However, each treatment does present at least one distinct phenotype. HexokinaseB transformants overaccumulate trehalose in stationary phase. <b>Phosphoglucose-isomerase</b> transformants hyperaccumulate glycogen during mid-exponential phase. Phosphofructokinase transformants fail to accumulate glycogen during stationary phase. Pyruvate kinase transformants demonstrate lower growth rate, higher stationary-phase density, sporulate poorly, and fail to accumulate glycogen during stationary phase. Like phosphofructokinase transformants, they present hexose phosphate profiles that suggest overexpression impedes gluconeogenesis by creating a futile cycle. Transformants carrying Tn 5 disruptions of plasmid-borne PYK or plasmid-borne PGI present control phenotypes. ^ Metabolic networks appear intrinsically buffered to large, constituitive, single-step increases in the activity of 2 ̆ 2 housekeeping 2 ̆ 2 enzymes. Nevertheless, such increases have measurable physiological impact. For at least one enzyme, pyruvate kinase, this translates into potential fitness phenotypes. It follows that higher-order character states of allozyme variants that show comparable differences {{may not always be}} predictable using models based on metabolic control theory. ...|$|E
40|$|In baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), {{accumulation}} of the non-reducing disaccharide, trehalose, is triggered by stimuli that activate the heat-shock response. Previously, trehalose levels {{have been shown}} to be closely correlated with thermotolerance, suggesting a protective function of this substance. Genetic evidence in support of this view is presented in an accompanying paper [De Virgilio, C., Hottiger, T., Dominguez, J., Boller, T. & Wiemken, A. (1993) Eur. J. Biochem. 219, 179 - 186]. In this study, we have examined the effect of trehalose on the thermal stability of proteins, a parameter thought to be a major determinant of thermotolerance. Physiological concentrations of trehalose (up to 0. 5 M) were found to efficiently protect enzymes of yeast (glucose- 6 P-dehydrogenase, <b>phosphoglucose-isomerase)</b> as well as enzymes of non-yeast origin (bovine glutamic dehydrogenase, EcoRI) against heat inactivation in vitro. Trehalose also reduced the heat-induced formation of protein aggregates. The disaccharide proved to be a compatible solute, as even at very high concentrations (up to 1 M) it did not significantly interfere with the activity of test enzymes. Trehalose was at least as good or better a protein stabilizer than any of a number of other compatible solutes (including sugars, polyalcohols and amino acids), while the structurally related trehalose- 6 P was devoid of any protective effect. Thermoprotection of enzymes by trehalose was evident even in solutions containing high concentrations of yeast protein or substrate. The data indicate that trehalose accumulation may increase the thermotolerance of yeast by enhancing protein stability in intact cells...|$|E
40|$|Light brown apple moth (LBAM), Epiphyas postvittana, is a leafroller pest {{native to}} Australia and {{currently}} has limited distribution around the world. The moth {{is an extremely}} polyphagous species which can feed on more than 250 host plants, including many important economic crops such as fruit, vegetable and ornamental species. Epiphas postvittana is also well-known for its polymorphism with respect to its morphology. Its physiology and biology have been well studied compared with many other pest species. For the past 10 years, however, this moth has been gradually expanding its territory around the world. This has resulted in increasing calls for targeted risk assessment so that appropriate quarantine measurements can {{be put in place}} to prevent its entry and spread into new regions. Three important aspects related to risk of establishment by E. postvittana were investigated in this study, 1) E. postvittana potential global distribution based on climate, 2) the genetic variation of a target gene for its potential to assess population fitness and invasibility, and 3) the potential use of barcoding as molecular tool for E. postvittana identification at the border. By comparing the climatic conditions of its native (Australia) and long-established (New Zealand) ranges {{to the rest of the}} world using CLIMEX, it is suggested that E. postvittana has potential to establish in countries in Central and South America, southern Africa, west Europe and South-east Asia. However, the predicted global distribution of E. postvittana using a range of other types of species distribution models suggested that there are additional climatically suitable areas around the world where this species could potentially survive and establish. Morphological identification of E. postvittana has been problematic which increased the risk of it esacaping detection at the border of countries that wish to regulate this pest. In this study, we sequenced the COI gene from 26 samples of E. postvittana from four populations in New Zealand. We found that the intraspecies variation of E. postvittana is less than 3 %, while interspecies variation between E. postvittana and other tortricid species available in the barcode of life database (BOLD) system is much greater than 3 %. This result confirms that using barcodes for identification of E. postvittana for biosecurity purposes is practical. The COI gene sequences have been submitted to GenBank as reference sequences. Genetic analysis of the <b>phosphoglucose-isomerase</b> (Pgi) gene in E. postvittana was investigated based on its association with various characteristics of fitness in other Lepidoptera. Using novel PCR primers developed in this study, a comparison of 957 bp of the Pgi coding region amongst four E. postvittana populations revealed 70 segregating sites including 61 synonymous and nine non-synonymous sites. Introns of Pgi gene also show a great variation in length among populations and between alleles within the same locus. The significant variation of Pgi gene in E. postvittana populations indicates the Pgi gene as a useful target gene to assess fitness factors associated with invasibility of E. postvittana. Modeling species distributions and pest identification are both key components in pest risk assessment. The study of fitness-associated genetic variation is currently a novel approach additional approach to risk assessment of invasive species but has much potential in this area. Our study provides basic but important information for further assessment of the establishment capacity of this species in new habitats. Further research in these areas will provide the knowledge required to make science-based decisions in biosecurity...|$|E
