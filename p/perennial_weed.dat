50|$|Rumex obtusifolius, {{commonly}} known as bitter dock, broad-leaved dock, bluntleaf dock, dock leaf or butter dock, is a <b>perennial</b> <b>weed</b> in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to Europe but can now {{be found in the}} United States and many other countries around the world such as Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|It also infects many <b>perennial</b> <b>weed</b> {{species that}} {{can act as}} virus {{reservoirs}} for susceptible agricultural crops. These weed species include Solanum nigrum (nightshade), S. aculeatissimum (soda apple), Chenopodium album (pigweed), Datura stramonium (jimson weed), Linaria canadensis (blue toadflax), and Physalis spp. (ground cherry). Thus, recommendations for the control of this virus include the control of weeds in and around susceptible solanaceous crops.|$|E
50|$|Clopyralid (3,6-dichloro-2-pyridinecarboxylic acid) is a {{selective}} herbicide used {{for control of}} broadleaf weeds, especially thistles and clovers. Clopyralid is in the picolinic acid family of herbicides, which also includes aminopyralid, picloram, triclopyr, and several less common herbicides. For control of Creeping Thistle, Cirsium arvense, a noxious, <b>perennial</b> <b>weed,</b> clopyralid {{is one of the}} few effective herbicides available. It is particularly damaging to peas, tomatoes and sunflowers and can render potatoes, lettuce and spinach inedible. It does not affect members of the family Poaceae (grasses).|$|E

50|$|A no-dig {{system is}} easier than digging. It is a long term process, and is reliant upon having {{plentiful}} organic matter to provide mulch material. It {{is also helpful to}} remove any <b>perennial</b> <b>weed</b> roots from the area beforehand, although their hold can be weakened by applying a light-excluding surface layer such as large sheets of cardboard or several thicknesses of spread out newspaper before adding the compost mulch. The newspaper or cardboard should be thoroughly wet to help it lie flat and keep it from blowing away until the overlying material is added.|$|E
50|$|Barley crown rust can infect rye {{as well as}} barley. In addition, it also infects {{a number}} of wild grasses {{including}} quackgrass (Elytrigia repens), slender wheatgrass (Elymus tranchycaulus), western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii), foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum), and several wheatgrasses (Elytrigia spp.) and wild rye grasses (Elymus spp. and Leymus spp.). The fungus readily forms telia on these hosts, which serve as a reservoir of overwintering teliospores. Quackgrass {{may be the most}} important reservoir for overwintering telia. This ubiquitous, <b>perennial</b> <b>weed</b> is very susceptible to the rust and is often found growing near Rhamnus.|$|E
50|$|Historically {{the reasons}} for tilling the soil are to remove weeds, loosen and aerate the soil, and {{incorporate}} organic matter such as compost or manure into lower soil layers. In areas with thin soil and high erosion {{there is a strong}} case against digging, which argues that in the long term it can be detrimental to the food web in the fragile topsoil. While digging is an effective way of removing <b>perennial</b> <b>weed</b> roots, it also often causes seeds that can remain dormant for many decades to come to the surface and germinate. The act of aerating the soil also increases the rate of decomposition and reduces soil organic matter. Digging can also damage soil structure, causing compaction, and unbalance symbiotic and mutualist interactions among soil life. Digging tends to displace nutrients, shifting surface organic material deeper, where there is less oxygen to support the decomposition to plant-available nutrients, which then need to be otherwise replenished. Digging is practised traditionally in countries with old, deep, rich soils such as Western Europe, however traditionally there, this is followed by periodic resting of the soil, usually with an undisturbed cover crop.|$|E
40|$|Long-term {{control of}} <b>perennial</b> <b>weeds</b> create a {{challenge}} in organic farming, especially in ar-able farming. <b>Perennial</b> <b>weeds</b> are most often controlled by tillage, often stubble tillage after harvest of cereals or short-term tillage during the summer (Melander et al., 2005).

40|$|In {{long-term}} organic {{crop rotation}} experiments for cereal production, stubble cultivation to control <b>perennial</b> <b>weeds</b> increased nitrogen leaching compared to catch crops grown after harvest. Stubble cultivation {{contributed to the}} control of Elymus repens on a sandy soil, {{but not to the}} control of Cirsium arvense on a loamy soil. Manure application had a tendency to decrease E. repens density in one rotation at the sandy soil. Grass-clover green manure decreased C. arvense in the succeeding crops. Despite high infestations of <b>perennial</b> <b>weeds,</b> yields were at the same level with as without stubble cultivation. The results point to an important dilemma in organic farming: should the farmer control <b>perennial</b> <b>weeds</b> in the stubble at the expense of losing nitrogen by leaching?

40|$|We {{studied the}} early {{vegetation}} dynamics in former croplands (sunflower and cereal fields) sown with a low-diversity seed mixture (composed of 2 native grass species) in Egyek-Pusztakócs, Hortobágy National Park, East-Hungary. The percentage cover of vascular plants {{was recorded in}} 4 permanent plots per field on 7 restored fields between 2006 and 2009. Ten aboveground biomass samples per field were also collected in June in each year. We addressed two questions: (i) How do seed sowing and annual mowing affect the species richness, biomass and cover of weeds? (ii) How fast does the cover of sown grasses develop after seed sowing? Weedy species were characteristic {{in the first year}} after sowing. In the second and third year their cover and species richness decreased. From the second year onwards the cover of perennial grasses increased. Spontaneously immigrating species characteristic to the reference grasslands were also detected with low cover scores. Short-lived weeds were suppressed as their cover and biomass significantly decreased during the study. The amount of litter and sown grass biomass increased progressively. However, <b>perennial</b> <b>weed</b> cover, especially the cover of Cirsium arvense increased substantially.

40|$|<b>Perennial</b> <b>weeds</b> are an {{increasing}} problem in Finland, particularly in organic farming. Mechanical control by hoeing, stubble cultivation and bare fallowing provides some options for managing these weeds. Mechanical control of <b>perennial</b> <b>weeds</b> in barley and oats was studied {{in a field}} experiment with five replicates, placed in a clay soil (containing 6 12 % organic matter) field under organic production. The field was heavily infested with Sonchus arvensis and moderately infested with Cirsium arvense, Elymus repens and Stachys palustris. The treatments were (2001 2002) barley oats, barley oats with inter-row hoeing, and bare fallow oats, and additionally stubble cultivation (yes/no) across these treatments. The experiment was analyzed as a strip-plot design with stubble cultivation as a horizontal factor and treatment as a vertical factor. Weed number and dry mass were assessed prior to crop harvest from two 0. 5 m × 0. 5 m quadrats per plot. Both stubble cultivation in previous autumn and inter-row hoeing reduced significantly S. arvensis biomass in oats, but bare fallowing was the most effective treatment. Bare fallowing also controlled E. repens and S. palustris, but was not effective against C. arvense. Oat yields were slightly higher after bare fallow and slightly lower in hoeing treatment compared to ordinary oatsafter- barley crop stand, but the differences were not statistically significant. The results suggest that S. arvensis could be reduced by stubble cultivation in previous autumn, and could even be controlled by inter-row hoeing in oat stands. Bare fallow is {{an effective way to}} reduce most <b>perennial</b> <b>weeds.</b> When tackling <b>perennial</b> <b>weeds</b> in oat production, appropriate options for a given field and rotation should be chosen according to dominant weed species. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|R
