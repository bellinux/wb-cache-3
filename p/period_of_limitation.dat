50|$|The {{conclusion}} of the Fifth Circuit was that the District court had found that as a statute <b>of</b> <b>limitations,</b> § 10(b) applies only to particular causes of action, not to particular types of people.

50|$|In {{the reign}} of Victoria there was a vast mass of {{legislation}} dealing with real estate in almost every conceivable aspect. At the immediate beginning of the reign stands the Wills Act 1837. The transfer of real estate was simplified by the Real Property Act of 1845 and by the Conveyancing Acts of 1881 and 1882. Additional powers of dealing with settled estates were given by the Settled Estates Act 1856, later by the Settled Estates Act 1877, and the Settled Land Act 1882. Succession duty was levied {{for the first time}} on freeholds in 1853. The strictness of the Mortmain Act was relaxed in favour of gifts and sales to public institutions of various kinds, such as schools, parks and museums. The <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> was shortened for most purposes from twenty to twelve years by the Real Property Limitation Act 1874. Several acts were passed dealing with the enfranchisement and commutation of copyholds and the preservation of commons and open spaces. The Naturalization Act 1870 enabled aliens to hold and transfer land in England. The Felony Act 1870, abolished forfeiture of real estate on conviction for felony. The Agricultural Holdings Acts 1883 and 1900, and other acts, gave the tenant of a tenancy within the acts a general right to compensation for improvements, substituted a year's notice to quit for the six months' notice previously necessary, enlarged the tenant's right to fixtures, and limited the amount of distress. By the Intestate Estates Act 1884 the law of escheat was extended to incorporeal hereditaments and equitable estates. Among other subjects which have been dealt with by legislation in the 19th century may be mentioned land transfer, registration, mortgage, partition, excambion, fixtures, taking of land in execution, declaration of title and apportionment.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the award}} of damages in tort may protect {{pre-existing}} expectations (e.g. of earning capacity or of business profits), a claimant cannot {{be seen to}} benefit from the breach of the duty of care. The measure of damages is therefore to ensure that the claimant is [...] "no worse off" [...] having suffered the breach of the duty of care. In each case, the claimant must prove the cause of action on the balance of probabilities. For these purposes, the court is required to speculate on what would have happened had there been no negligence. In many cases, loss and damage might have been sustained even if all had gone as planned. But there might always have been a chance that no long-term loss and damage would occur. For example, a person may attend a hospital with an existing injury. The only effect of any negligence in the treatment may be that the patient loses the chance of a full recovery, i.e. what was merely threatened becomes inevitable. Thus, actions by claimants whose chances of recovery from illness or injury have been reduced due to the professional negligence of their doctors have failed when they could not establish that, with proper treatment, their chances of recovery would have exceeded 50%. In Gregg v Scott 2005 UKHL 2; 2005 2 WLR 268 a man whose chances of surviving non-Hodgkins Lymphoma for ten years were reduced from 42% to 25% by a delay in diagnosis could not claim damages because his chances were already too slim for the delay to have worsened his position. This was {{complicated by the fact that}} the case was brought before the court following an extended delay at which point the plaintiff was still alive. In judgement this was cited as a significant weakness in his claim. The principle is that a claimant must have had a more than 50% chance of survival to establish causation in order to satisfy the balance of probability test. However, in some Australian states, claims for loss of chance have been succeeded in medical negligence cases: e.g. Rufo v Hosking (2004) NSWCA 391. Their approach argues that a patient would rather have a 42% than a 25% chance of survival. If negligence reduces the percentage, common sense justice rejects a black-and-white approach to accepting or rejecting a claim based on an expert's opinion as to whether there was ever a 50% chance of survival, and prefers to offer mitigated damages to represent the loss of chance. In cases of economic loss, the rule that a claimant cannot normally recover for a lost chance is modified. In Kitchen v. Royal Airforce Association 1958 2 All ER 241 a solicitor failed to issue a writ within the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> in respect of a fatal accident. The surviving spouse sued for damages as she was unable to pursue her claim. There was no doubt that the loss was caused by the solicitors’ negligence and the only argument related to quantification of her claim. Although it was argued on behalf of the solicitors that the claimant might not have won her case, and may therefore have lost nothing, the court held that she had lost a chance and, as this was a valuable right, she should be compensated for it. Similarly, in Stovold v. Barlows (1996) PNLR 91 a solicitor acting for a vendor failed to use the appropriate system for sending the title deeds to a purchaser. Consequently, the claimant lost his chance to sell the property at a higher price. But damages were reduced by 50% as the court held that the purchaser might have bought another property even if the documents had arrived on time. In First Interstate Bank of California v Cohen Arnold & Co. (1996) PNLR 17 the claimant bank had loaned money to a client of the defendant accountants who negligently overstated the net worth of their clients. The bank then became concerned about the amount of the loan outstanding but, relying on the representations made by the defendant accountants, the bank delayed in calling in the loan. As a result of the delay in placing the property on the market, the price obtained was £1.45 million whereas the bank contended that it could have realised £3 million in an earlier sale. The Court of Appeal valued the chance at 66.66% on the assumption that “but for” the negligence, the property would actually have been sold for 66.66% of £3 million.|$|E

40|$|From August to October 1996, {{a station}} in the {{freshwater}} tidal reaches of the Schelde estuary was sampled every two days to study short-term changes in the phytoplankton community. The monitoring study started after {{a long period of}} low and constant discharge and our data suggest that at that time, phytoplankton productivity was bottom-up limited by silica and/or top-down controlled by grazers. Rainfall in the middle of August resulted in a flushing of almost half of the estuarine volume upstream of our monitoring station. This fresher ended the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> by removing grazers as well as supplying new silica, while having no direct effect on total phytoplankton biomass. It was followed by a gradual increase in phytoplankton biomass. An extremely high runoff event caused by a storm at the end of August resulted in a flushing of the entire freshwater tidal reach. Phytoplankton biomass dropped and the estuarine phytoplankton community was replaced with one of riverine origin which was not adapted to the growth conditions prevailing within the estuary. Afterwards, autochthonous phytoplankton populations were not able to recover due to the presence of grazers and a general decrease in light levels and temperature.

Author notes, that there is some uncertainty, due to the beginning of term from the statute of limitations to claim vindication. The difficult {{is due to the fact}} that for the time of search of the lost (stolen) things the owner cannot apply to the court for protection of violated rights, because the defendant, whose actions violated authority ownership, personally is not defined.

40|$|Purpose – to {{determine}} the features of collagen metabolism state in women with recurrent genital prolapse at the stage of scheduled surgery and in postoperative period using prolene implants. The level of hydroxyproline metabolites (HO) in 130 patients with recurrent genital prolapse (study group) who underwent prolene implant surgery to correct fascial defects and 30 patients without prolapse evidence (control group) were examined. State of collagen metabolism was assessed by plasma levels of free (FОP), peptideassociated (PAO) and protein associated oxyproline (PrAO) using P. N. Sharaeva’s method. The survey was carried out before surgery and in 6, 12 months after surgery. Phenotypic diagnosis of connective tissue dysplasia was made in points. For mathematical treatment of the results obtained the software package STATISTICA ® for Windows, Release 8. 0 company StatSoft ® Inc., USA was used (2010). In the main group in 13 (10, 3 ± 1, 6 %) patients all parameters were above normal values, in 14 (10, 8 ± 3, 8 %) patients with normal values of PrAO and FOP there was a reduction of PAO. Reduction of both factions of oxyproline was determined in 7 (5, 3 ± 1, 6 %) patients. PrAO level in the study group {{was significantly higher than}} 11. 24 (7, 82 - 15, 08) pmol/L, than in the control group – 9. 54 (7, 72 - 13, 4) pmol/L (p< 0, 05). In 23 (17, 7 ± 3, 1 %) patients of the main group PAO decrease was observed against the background of increased FOP values. The number of patients with high levels of PrAO in different subgroups was different. However, no significant correlation changes of PrAO with the severity of CTD were defined. A significant difference of FOP indices in core group as compared with the control group 4, 29 (5, 43 - 9, 76) pmol/l and 9, 03 (4, 95 - 9, 92) pmol/L, respectively (p< 0, 05) was found. High median FOP 11. 26 (9, 48 - 25, 05) level pmol/l was determined in patients with posthysterectomy prolapse. A reliable link of high levels of PAO with the severity of the CTD (p< 0, 05) was noted. In the study group there was an overall decline in median PAO 7, 23 (6, 01 - 11, 3) pmol/l as compared to 9. 31 (7, 03 - 10, 9) pmol/l PAO in the control group (p< 0, 05). In the study group six months after surgery PrAO level decreased by 26, 8 ± 1, 8 % (p< 0, 001) in relation to the initial values. After 12 months, PrAO level in the main group was rising gradually but was 19, 7 ± 1, 2 % lower as compared to the level before the surgery (p< 0, 05). The obtained results pointed to a high activity of collagen formation in the area of prolene implant placement and justified prolene implants use in patients with signs of destructive processes in the connective tissue.
