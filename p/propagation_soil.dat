The paper discussed eight topics in forestry that might benefit from centralized international research. These were biotechnology, vegetative <b>propagation,</b> <b>soil</b> microbiology, germplasm conservation, policy research, utilization research, plant protection, and finally remote sensing and information systems.

40|$|Neocheiropteris palmatopedata, a {{rare and}} {{endangered}} species endemic to China, has a scattered distribution only in Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan provinces. Declining rapidly in population size and {{on the verge of}} extinction, it was listed as a plant of second-class protection in The List of Chinese Urgently Protected Wild Plants. To explore endangerment mechanisms of N. palmatopedata, we investigated its population and community structure, germination and growth characteristics as well as soil properties of its habitat. Our results indicated that N. palmatopedata grew in primary evergreen broad-leaved, and mixed coniferous–broad-leaved forests. It was dominated by other species in the community. Spores germinated without a dormancy period and the germination rate was high, indicating that spore characteristics are not a factor causing its endangerment. However, N. palmatopedata required {{a long period of time}} to complete its life cycle under natural conditions. During this period, it was vulnerable to stochastic events such as drought, causing a low seedling survival rate. Although the species shows strong rhizome initiation, population growth is not affected by rhizome <b>propagation.</b> <b>Soil</b> property analysis showed that organic matter, potent Ca and availability of Mg were key factors for growth and development of N. palmatopedata. In conclusion, narrow bioecological characteristics led to lowered survivorship and contribute to the endangerment of N. palmatopedata. Human-induced habitat loss and accompanying habitat fragmentation likely accelerated the endangerment process. Our results could provide a theoretical basis for the effective protection of this species...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to conduct a field-oriented evaluation, coupled with {{advanced}} laboratory techniques, of channel degradation in a stream of the Deep Loess Region of western Iowa, namely Mud Creek. The Midwestern United States is an ideal place for such a study considering that ~$ 1 Billion of infrastructure and farmland has been lost recently to channel degradation. A common form of channel degradation in this region is associated with the formation of knickpoints, which naturally manifest as short waterfalls within the channel that migrate upstream. As flow plunges over a knickpoint face, scouring of the downstream bed creates a plunge pool. This downcutting increases bank height, facilitating bank failure, stream widening, and damage to critical bridge infrastructure. We conducted a state-of-the-art geotechnical analysis of the sediments from the knickpoint face, plunge pool, and adjacent stream banks to determine the areas of the streambed near the bridge infrastructure that favor knickpoint <b>propagation.</b> <b>Soil</b> characterization using particle size distributions and Gamma Spectroscopy identified a stratigraphic discontinuity at the elevation where the knickpoint forms. An automated surveillance camera was established to monitor the location of the knickpoint face relative to a fixed datum and provide a first-order approximation of its migration rate, which was approximately 0. 9 m over a 248 -day study period. Surveys conducted of the stream reach also facilitated information about knickpoint migration. Flow measurements using Largescale Particle Image Velocimetry were conducted during the study to understand the hydrodynamic conditions at the site. The results of this research will assist local and federal transportation agencies in better understanding the following: (1) principal geotechnical and hydrodynamic factors that control knickpoint propagation, (2) identify necessary data for extraction and analysis to predict knickpoint formation, (3) provide mitigation measures such as grade control structures (e. g., sheet-pile weirs, bank stabilization measures) near bridge crossings to control the propagation of knickpoints and prevent further damage to downstream infrastructure...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of recent ground shock experiments conducted by the U. S.

40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} patterns of soil moisture {{are one of}} the most important information for agricultural practices. Many agricultural management strategies strongly rely on the availability of soil moisture information. Indeed, there is an urgent need to develop advanced techniques that can provide reliable soil moisture data. Recently, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has emerged as a useful tool to nondestructively retrieve soil water content at the field scale. Based on the dominant effect of soil water content on GPR wave <b>propagation,</b> <b>soil</b> water content can be estimated by analyzing the GPR data. In this study, we present the application of a new near-field antenna model to characterize the temporal and spatial variations of soil water content along an agricultural transect in central Belgium. Compared to other traditional approaches, our approach uses all information from the GPR data for signal inversion, thereby more accurate results are expected to be obtained. In addition, by employing a mobile measurement system with a vector network analyzer, a horn antenna and a differential GPS, real-time mapping can be achieved. The measurements were carried out weekly during three months (from March 2011 to June 2011) along the transect. For soil moisture estimation, we applied 3 models of soil to represent the vertical variation of the soil moisture: 1 -layered model, 2 -layered model and soil water profile model. Accordingly, the soil was assumed to be a homogeneous half-space in the 1 -layered model, a top soil layer above a half-space medium in the 2 -layered medium and a continuously-varying water content profile above a half-space medium in the soil water profile model. The soil water profile was simulated using the van Genuchten (1980) formula. To solve the nonlinear inverse problem, we developed an integrated approach to reduce the number of unknown parameters. The inversion is firstly applied for the 1 -layered model with two unknown parameters, namely the antenna height and permittivity of the upper layer. Next, using the parameters obtained by the 1 -layered model, we need to optimize only the thickness of the upper layer and the dielectric permittivity of the lower layer in the 2 -layered model. Finally, by assuming that the position of the inflection point is equal to the thickness of the upper layer which was estimated by the 2 -layered model and using the values in the 1 -layered model, the number of unknown parameters in the soil water profile model reduces from 6 to 3. The local optimization algorithm Levenberg–Marquardt was used to solve the inverse problem and estimate the dielectric permittivity of the soil. The dielectric permittivity was transformed into soil moisture by the model of Ledieu et al. (1986) and the relationship between the electrical conductivity and the water content relates to each other by the formula of Rhoades et al. (1976). The numerical evaluation shows that our approach can well estimate the permittivity of the upper layer in all scenarios. For the soil water profile and 2 -layered model, the performance of the approach is better when the contrast between upper and lower layers is larger. The results achieved along the transect indicate that the spatial variation of the water content in the top soil layer is controlled by the transect topography, while rainfall is the main factor that influences on the temporal variation. The proposed approach provides a useful technique to rapidly map the soil moisture in the field scale...|$|E

40|$|The main {{scientific}} and engineering {{goal of this}} book is to deal simultaneously with soil dynamics/vibrations and wave <b>propagation</b> in <b>soils</b> (including seismic waves).
