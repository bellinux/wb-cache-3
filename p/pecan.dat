5|$|August 18, 1969– Hurricane Camille strikes {{southern}} Mississippi as a Category 5 hurricane, {{with its}} large wind field producing a 71mph (114km/h) wind gust and 3.55inches (90mm) {{of rain in}} Pensacola. The hurricane causes minor crop damage to <b>pecan</b> trees and corn stalks.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pecans</b> {{were one}} of the most {{recently}} domesticated major crops. Although wild <b>pecans</b> were well known among native and colonial Americans as a delicacy, the commercial growing of <b>pecans</b> in the United States did not begin until the 1880s. As of 2010, the U.S. produces between 80% and 95% of the world's <b>pecans,</b> with an annual crop of 150-200 thousand tons from more than 10 million trees. The nut harvest for growers is typically around mid-October. Historically, the leading pecan-producing state in the U.S. has been Georgia, followed by Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Louisiana, and Oklahoma, the largest orchard being Stahmann Farms in south-central New Mexico; <b>pecans</b> are also grown in Alabama, California, Florida, Arkansas, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Hawaii. Outside the United States, <b>pecans</b> are grown in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Israel, Mexico, Peru, and South Africa. They can be grown from USDA hardiness zones approximately 5 to 9, provided summers are also hot and humid.|$|R

5|$|William L.

He worked as a teacher and principal at Cedar Bluff Academy before taking a public school position in Denver, although he resigned upon arriving and learning that the school was integrated. Mayo then moved to <b>Pecan</b> Gap in Delta County, Texas, in 1886, where his aunt and uncle lived; he began teaching at the local public school, and by 1889 had become superintendent of nearby Cooper's public school system. During his tenure in <b>Pecan</b> Gap, Mayo earned a reputation as a disciplinarian, but also as a sympathetic instructor.|$|E

5|$|Schools were {{important}} during the 1940s, as {{they became the}} local activity centers. In the early 1940s, there were 34 common schools and six independent school districts within Delta County. These schools employed 134 people and had a combined total of 4,000 students enrolled. Cooper, along with <b>Pecan</b> Gap and Enloe, offered a four-year high school program.

5|$|In Mississippi, {{heavy rain}} from Juan flooded about 340homes and businesses, {{mainly in the}} {{southern}} portion of the state. High winds and waves damaged ports in Pass Christian and Long Beach. Several boats were damaged along the coast, and the seafood industry suffered losses. Beach erosion damaged coastal roads, leaving debris and marsh grass behind when the storm passed. The total storm cost in the state was estimated at $776,000. In neighboring Alabama, Juan only produced wind gusts of , which caused little damage, but the storm's rainfall contributed to Mobile recording its wettest October on record. The rains caused flooding along streets and low-lying areas, but property generally escaped unscathed. The flooding did cause locally heavy crop damage; some farmers lost 50% of their soybean crop, and the <b>pecan</b> crop was damaged after earlier being affected by Hurricane Elena. Damage in the state was minor, estimated at over $65,000.|$|E
5|$|On September 24, the {{southern}} two-thirds of Georgia was declared a disaster by President Bush. The state lost 50percent of its <b>pecan</b> crop due to Frances, {{which led to}} a price rise in pecans by late October. Lost peach trees were expected to lower output during 2005, and increase peach prices. A disaster declaration was made for the northeast section of South Carolina on October 7. On September 10, President Bush declared 34 counties within North Carolina a disaster area, making them eligible for US$6.5million (2004 dollars) in public assistance. A Wildlife Commission removed its North Carolina Mountain State Fair exhibit due to Frances midway through the fair. Over 100,000 trout were lost due to the storm in the Pisgah, Table Rock, Marion, and Armstrong state fish hatcheries. Red Cross volunteers distributed over 200,000 gallons of water by its 600 volunteers in four days.

5|$|Despite {{its effects}} in the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico, only one person was directly killed from the storm there; a man drowned off the coast when he fell off his sailboat near Fort Morgan, Alabama. One indirect casualty also occurred in the area, when a man {{had a heart attack}} while trying to secure a boat off the Alabama coast during the storm. Numerous roads became flooded and impassable for several days, south and along I-10 in Mobile, south and central Choctaw, and Baldwin counties. Along the Fowl and Fish rivers, in Mobile and Baldwin counties respectively, significant damage to homes occurred due to flooding. Most roads on Dauphin Island were flooded in over a foot of water. A few homes were close to falling into Mobile Bay, and one home had to be moved backwards towards land to prevent its destruction. At the peak of the storm in Alabama, at least 44,000people were without power in Mobile and Baldwin counties. In rural Choctaw County, north of Mobile, several families were rescued from flooded roads and trapped cars. The majority of houses and businesses on Dauphin Island and buildings from the western shore of Mobile Bay, and from Fort Morgan east to Orange Beach, had roof damage. $ (1997USD, $ USD) in total property damage occurred in Alabama, in addition to <b>pecan</b> and pine tree damage costing $ (1997USD, $ USD).|$|E
40|$|<b>Pecans</b> are {{a member}} of the hickory family (Juglandaceae) which {{includes}} walnut and hickory. ● The trees are large and long-lived, reaching up to 100 feet tall and living 80 years or more. ● Georgia and Texas are the largest producers of <b>pecans</b> in the U.

5|$|Harrison and Hancock {{counties}} {{were generally}} not affected quite as severely as communities {{closer to the}} Alabama border, but the entire area still suffered extensively. In sections of Gulfport, large fires were sparked by downed power lines and fed by broken natural gas pipes. Debris on roadways prevented firefighters from reaching the fires, allowing them to spread. Similar destruction was seen to the east at Biloxi, where the hurricane's winds tore the roofs off many buildings. Beachfront communities were {{in a state of}} disarray, with large trees uprooted, debris littering the ground, and accumulations of sand on parts of roads like U.S. 90. Damage to schools in Harrison County—particularly in Gulfport and Biloxi—was extensive. Most homes in the area survived the storm, which was locally estimated to have been a once-in-50-year event, with relatively little damage. Several buildings along the coast in the Biloxi area sustained severe damage, but many of the older houses near the Gulf of Mexico there fared remarkably well. Winds brought down large highway signs, in some cases striking nearby buildings. Along the coast, Elena caused beach erosion, damaged coastal structures and recreational beach facilities, and dislocated navigational buoys and markers in various ports, several of which were closed pending Coast Guard inspection. Winds over inland Pearl River County damaged 350 permanent and mobile homes, and as in Alabama, the hurricane took a large toll on <b>pecan</b> and soybean crops and farms.|$|E
5|$|Reports of a {{potentially}} destructive hurricane near the United States Gulf Coast forced thousands of residents in low-lying areas to evacuate {{prior to the}} storm moving inland. Offshore, the hurricane generated rough seas and a strong storm surge, peaking at 6.4ft (1.95m) on {{the western edge of}} Lake Pontchartrain. The anomalously high tides flooded many of Louisiana's outlying islands, inundating resorts. Strong winds caused moderate infrastructural damage, primarily in Texas, though its impact was mainly to communication networks along the U.S. Gulf Coast which were disrupted by the winds. However, much of the property and crop damage wrought by the hurricane was due to the torrential rainfall it produced in low-lying areas, setting off record floods. Rainfall peaked at 37.5in (953mm) in Miller Island off Louisiana, making it the wettest tropical cyclone in state history. Nineteen official weather stations in both Texas and Louisiana observed record 24-hour rainfall totals for the month of August {{as a result of the}} slow-moving hurricane. Property, livestock, and crops – especially cotton, corn, and <b>pecan</b> crops – were heavily damaged. Entire ecosystems were also altered by the rainfall. Overall, the storm caused $10.75million in damages and seven fatalities.|$|E
