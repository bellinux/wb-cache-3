50|$|In 1981, Israeli Air Force {{successfully}} sabotaged the Iraqi {{nuclear program}} after commencing a successful surprise air strike on Iraqi nuclear installations at Osirak, under the codename Operation Opera. The Operation Opera played a psychological role in Pakistan {{as it was}} a successful operation commenced by Israeli Air Force. The Air Intelligence <b>picked</b> <b>reports</b> about suspected activities near the Indo-Pakistan border. Therefore, PAF was put on high alert and in 1983, the PAF made first contact with suspected IAF F-16s. The PAF jets intercepted the suspected F-16s and confirmed their Israeli identity. The PAF jets took aggressive measures and their tactics surprised the IAF F-16s. Panicked and surprised, the mission was cancelled and IAF F-16s were pulled off immediately.|$|R

40|$|Warehouse Management Systems (WMSs) record where {{products}} {{are stored in}} a physical warehouse; however, when pickers misplace products the WMS becomes misaligned with the real situation. Due {{to the fact that}} the WMS is not aware of these misalignments, it can lead pickers to empty shelves or shelves with the wrong and unexpected products. This paper proposes an extension to a WMS that tracks the state of the quality of the data and modifies <b>picking</b> <b>reports</b> based on this state to help pickers either avoid or discover these misalignments, depending on how it is configured. Using an experimental simulation to evaluate the approach, this paper shows how the solution can outperform a standalone WMS by approximately 1 % when trying to avoid misalignments, and by approximately 32 % when attempting to discover the misalignments...|$|R

40|$|Body-focused {{repetitive}} behaviors (BFRBs) such as skin picking or scratching {{and nail}} biting can be physically and socially detrimental. Given the potential consequences {{associated with these}} behaviors, it is unfortunate this area has received relatively limited attention. The two pur-poses {{of the current study}} were (a) to determine the prevalence of BFRBs among typically devel-oping persons and (b) to examine the contribution of reported somatic activity to the occurrence of BFRBs. Results indicated that 13. 7 % of the sample met criteria for at least one BFRB, of which the most common topography was nail biting. Persons with a BFRB reported significantly more somatic activity than persons without a BFRB. Further analyses revealed consistent find-ings across three separate topographies in which persons with a BFRB for nail biting, mouth chewing, and / or skin <b>picking</b> <b>reported</b> significantly more somatic activity than did persons with-out a BFRB.
