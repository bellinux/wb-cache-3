25|$|The three-stage {{breaking}} action: initially, {{the material}} is gripped by the leading faces of opposed rotor teeth. These subject the rock to multiple point loading, inducing stress into the material to exploit any natural weaknesses. At the second stage, material is broken in tension by being subjected to a three-point loading, applied between the front tooth faces on one rotor, and rear tooth faces on the other rotor. Any lumps of material that still remain oversize, are broken as the rotors chop through the fixed teeth of the breaker bar, thereby achieving a three dimensional controlled <b>product</b> <b>size.</b>|$|E

The tourniquet comes in a variety of sizes. To determine the correct <b>product</b> <b>size,</b> the patient's limb circumference at the desired occlusion location should be measured, as well as their blood pressure to determine the best model. Once the correct model is selected, between two sterile medical personnel will be needed to apply the device. It should be noted, unlike with the pneumatic tourniquet, the silicone ring tourniquet should be applied after the drapes have been placed on the patient. This is due to the device being completely sterile. The majority of the devices require a two-man operation (with the exception of the extra large model): ...|$|E

40|$|Australian product coals are {{becoming}} finer-grained, mainly due to {{improvements in the}} performance of ultra-fine coal recovery methods. The finer the <b>product</b> coal <b>size</b> fraction, the more capacity it has to store water during beneficiation and the higher the pressure required to facilitate dewatering to meet the specified moisture. Following the removal of the pressure applied to facilitate dewatering, the particular <b>product</b> coal <b>size</b> fraction is left under a suction equivalent to that applied pressure, providing it with the potential to re-wet on the stockpile under moist conditions. During the dewatering process, the product coal is unsaturated. The relationship between applied pressure (or the equivalent suction felt on the removal of this pressure) and moisture content for a particular <b>product</b> coal <b>size</b> fraction is described by the Soil Water Characteristic Curve (SWCC) of the material, based on unsaturated soil mechanics principles. Such curves have been obtained for different <b>product</b> coal <b>size</b> fractions, from which the effectiveness of dewatering under a range of applied pressures can be estimated. Moisture content versus time data for ultra-fine and fine product coal samples under a constant applied suction have also been obtained for use in estimating the extent of dewatering achievable for a given residence time in a particular piece of dewatering equipment. The SWCCs can be used to supplement conventional methods in deciding the most appropriate dewatering equipment required to obtain a given moisture content for a particular <b>product</b> coal <b>size</b> fraction...|$|R
