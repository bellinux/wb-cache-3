An internal UK Foreign Office memorandum rejected Beadle's argument but recognised his belief that [...] "because {{of the effect of}} the effluxion of time, he was entitled to take a different view", and concluded that the Chief Justice's argument was [...] "sufficiently plausible to make it difficult to say that that position is manifestly improper or that, in adopting it, Sir Hugh Beadle is manifestly guilty of misconduct." [...] Beadle explained in a 1972 interview: [...] "We had been doing our best to try and uphold the law and when the thing was in the revolutionary stage we dug our toes in, we wouldn't budge. But then as the government became more and more entrenched we had to apply the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> which says that if a revolution succeeds the law changes with it.

The purpose of my thesis is to describe and summarize the main <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> private <b>law</b> that mostly appear in Czech law, especially in civil law. It also examines the influence of re-codification <b>of</b> private <b>law</b> on these principles and relationship between them. The thesis is composed of two parts.

The outcomes of the landowner appeals, together with those of the lawsuits against the plan which had been filed as early as 1810, created a body of precedents by which the state law was administered.

40|$|The article {{contains}} {{the review of}} the methods presented in Polish legal writings which are concerned with the legitimization <b>of</b> substantive <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> considered to be legal norms of a specific kind. The term „legitimizing the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> law" refers to an intellectual process consisting in arguing for legally binding force <b>of</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> The author considers the above term devoid of some defects present in other expressions, more frequently represented in legal writings. The methods <b>of</b> legitimizing the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> have been discussed in three basic groups, of which the first comprises the ways referring to applying only the directives of validation and interpretation, the second contains the methods of legitimization consisting also in carrying out legal reasonings according to specified inferential directives, and the third comprises the methods based on the statement that particular <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> are the norms <b>of</b> customary <b>law.</b> The actually existing ways <b>of</b> legitimizing the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> have been systematized by means of typology; hence, the requirements of separation and completeness do not apply.

The king, provoked at this opposition, summoned a council of the barons and bishops at Clarendon; and here, amongst others of less moment, the following were unanimously declared to be the ancient prerogatives of the crown. And it is something remarkable, and certainly makes much for the honor of their moderation, that the bishops and abbots who must have composed so large and weighty a part of the great council seem not only to have made no opposition to regulations which so remarkably contracted their jurisdiction, but even seem to have forwarded them.|$|E

40|$|This article reassesses {{the legal}} {{character}} <b>of</b> ‘the general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> recognized by civilized nations’, {{being one of}} the two unwritten sources <b>of</b> international <b>law.</b> The general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> are, however, the most controversial source <b>of</b> international <b>law</b> and have continued to divide the opinions of scholars and judges alike since their inception. Some view them as private law analogies, others as emanations <b>of</b> natural <b>law</b> and there are those who conflate them with custom. This article seeks to identify the appropriate methodology for ascertaining the existence of the controversial ‘general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> law’.

It is said the act tends to accumulate, to keep up the power of great families, and to add wealth to wealth. It may be that it does so. It is impossible that any <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> or government useful to the community should be established without an advantage to those who have the greatest stake in the country. Even some vices arise from it. The same laws which secure property encourage avarice; and the fences made about honest acquisition are the strong bars which secure the hoards of the miser. The dignities of magistracy are encouragements to ambition, with all the black train of villanies which attend that wicked passion. But still we must have laws to secure property, and still we must have ranks and distinctions and magistracy in the state, notwithstanding their manifest tendency to encourage avarice and ambition.|$|E
6000|$|The {{question}} is asked us: [...] "If slaves {{will go in}} notwithstanding the general <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> liberates them, why would they not equally go in against positive statute law--go in, even if the Missouri restriction were maintained!" [...] I answer, because it takes a much bolder man to venture in with his property {{in the latter case}} than in the former; because the positive Congressional enactment is known to and respected by all, or nearly all, whereas the negative principle that no law is free law is not much known except among lawyers. We have some experience of this practical difference. In spite of the Ordinance of '87, a few negroes were brought into Illinois, and held in a state of quasi-slavery, not enough, however, to carry a vote of the people in favor of the institution when they came to form a constitution. But into the adjoining Missouri country, where there was no Ordinance of '87,--was no restriction,--they were carried ten times, nay, a hundred times, as fast, and actually made a slave State. This is fact-naked fact.|$|E

60|$|In {{these two}} characters, Tito and Romola, {{we have an}} epitome of our author's moral teaching. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> {{was in the air}} during the Victorian era, and we have already noted how deeply Tennyson was {{influenced}} by it. With George Eliot law is like fate; it overwhelms personal freedom and inclination. Moral law was to her as inevitable, as automatic, as gravitation. Tito's degeneration, and the sad failure of Dorothea and Lydgate in Middlemarch, may be explained as simply as the fall of an apple, or as a bruised knee when a man loses his balance. A certain act produces a definite moral effect on the individual; and character is the added sum of all, the acts of a man's; life,--just as the weight of a body is the sum of the weights of many different atoms which constitute it. The matter of rewards and punishments, therefore, needs no final judge or judgment, since these things take care of themselves automatically in a world of inviolable moral law.|$|E

The Judges answered only the first, denying flatly the competence of the Managers. As to the second, the competence of the supposed evidence, they are profoundly silent. Having given this blow to our competence, about the other question, (which was more within their province,) namely, the competence of evidence on a case hypothetically stated, they give themselves no trouble.
