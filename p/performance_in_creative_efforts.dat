40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of color illumination on human behavior, especially cognitive performance. A series of experiments examined the hypothesis proposed by Mehta and Zhu (2009). The hypothesis was that red induced "avoidance motivation" enhancing the performance of tasks which needed attention to details, while blue induced "approach motivation" improving the <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> <b>creative</b> tasks. We employed some of the experimental tasks used in their study {{as well as our}} original ones. The task performances under red and blue illumination were compared. The results showed that memory <b>performance</b> increased <b>in</b> red condition compared to blue condition. However, the <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> the other cognitive tasks did not show any difference between the two illumination conditions, although subjective evaluation of the illumination colors showed different profiles between them. These results indicate that red illumination possibly enhances attention and/or focusing properties than blue, but that blue does not necessarily enhance <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> <b>creative</b> tasks than red. 出版者照会後に全文公...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Science affects all {{societal}} levels. However, {{many people}} feel intimidated and tend {{to shy away from}} science due to its complex nature. Scientists and researchers always sought ways to transfer the scientific knowledge to the public to eliminate any misunderstandings and provide clarity to people. In ancient times, scientific information was passed on by the scientist to the community by word of mouth as a mean of communication. This method empowered the one-way communication in science, and cultures viewed it as the only reliable approach in gaining scientific understanding. As popularity grew in science and controversial issues began to emerge regarding scientific findings and research, it proved that there is a compelling reason for the need for a dialogic approach. In essence, the questions and assumptions raised by scientific research call for an environment where people can request for clarification from the scientist or the person presenting the new idea. Advances in science and technology have also increased awareness among people, which emphasizes the move from monologue, or one-way communication, to Dialogue. This approach has proven to be an effective tool <b>in</b> <b>creative</b> <b>efforts</b> to solve problems (Faulkner 2011), yet there are situations where monologue is needed...|$|R

Important insights uncovered through this research include an increasing desire among audiences to curate their own experiences, artists and administrators seek to negotiate place alongside production values and "exibility, and the realization that arts policies and funding may not yet fully re"ect the current dynamic relationship between place and performance.

The subjects’ results were assessed by means of the intersubjective technique. The academic performance was measured by means of the grade given for two tests which test technical knowledge. We obtained no correlation between creativity and its parameters and academic achievement. However, for lower levels, we obtained correlations between verbal originality and achievement and verbal elaboration and achievement.
