The school provides parking there for senior year students who are registered for on campus parking and have a valid student parking permit. Other students with cars, need to park on streets surrounding the campus.|$|R
5|$|In October 2016, the MetroWest Regional Transit Authority (MWRTA) {{took over}} {{management}} of the station from the MBTA under a lease agreement. The agreement relieves the MBTA from the cost of maintaining the station, while allowing the MWRTA to use parking revenue to construct bus shelters and additional parking areas.

5|$|The Murano is a {{residential}} skyscraper in Center City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Part of a condominium boom {{occurring in the}} city, the Murano was announced in 2005 and was developed jointly by Thomas Properties Group and P Associates. The building, named after Murano, Italy, was completed in 2008 {{at a cost of}} US$165 million. The site, previously occupied by a <b>parking</b> <b>lot,</b> <b>was</b> the location of the Erlanger Theatre from 1927 to 1978.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic Village {{for housing}} athletes {{during the games}} {{would have been a}} $1.1-billion series of newly {{constructed}} lakefront buildings that would have been converted to rental and condominium units after the games. The village was to be located immediately south of McCormick Place, which was expected to host 11 event venues, on a current truck parking lot between South Lake Shore Drive and the Illinois Central Railroad tracks in the Near South Side and Douglas community areas. At the time, the <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> being used to stage events at McCormick Place. The village was slated to have pedways over Lake Shore Drive. This location was meant to enable 88% of the Olympic athletes to be within 15 minutes of their competition venue.|$|E

5|$|A new {{parking lot}} has been {{constructed}} on college-owned land between Sullivan Arena and privately owned Clarke Farm in Bedford. This parking lot {{has replaced the}} former Joan of Arc parking lot, which was located between the Dana Center, Davison Dining Hall, and the Joan of Arc dormitory (JOA). The former <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> torn down, and a grassy open quadrangle was constructed {{during the summer of}} 2012. A grotto has been built between JOA and Gadbois Hall and was dedicated in late 2014, with the placement of a religious statue. The quadrangle is yet to be named, and has new lights and walkways; the centerpiece is a large granite seal of the college. The project is the first place on campus where electronic gates have been installed. The gates are used to cordon off the roads of the new quad during the regular semester and can be opened for emergency vehicles and during move in/out days.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{the city}} and Amtrak {{attempted}} to fund a second renovation with a private partner, but plans fell through. In 1991, Amtrak constructed a rectangular concrete and glass station building {{on the north side}} of the tracks, in front of the passenger tunnel. Access from the south was blocked off. In 1999, the original station building was renovated at a cost of $7 million for use as commercial space. The front <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> expanded on a slope to the west; it covered much of the ground level (similar to the station before 1915). The mechanical building and the covered ramp to the trolley station were removed. A strip mall was built just to the east, with balustrades and archways referencing the historic station. The passageway from the subway station, long closed, was likely buried at this time. The 1901-built station building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 8, 1999.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to heavy}} rainfall, {{widespread}} flooding was reported, {{especially in the}} central and western portions of the county. Whole neighborhoods in The Acreage, Loxahatchee, Royal Palm Beach, and Wellington were left stranded for up to several days. In some areas, flooding was considered the worst since Hurricane Irene in 1999. At the post office in Loxahatchee, the <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> flooded, forcing the building to close for several days. A major washout was reported in West Palm Beach {{at the intersection of}} State Roads 80 and 882. Also in West Palm Beach, a road collapsed and fire rescue crews quickly closed the road. On State Road 704, a portion of it became inaccessible to low-clearance vehicles. A man died in West Palm Beach after driving through the storm and crashing into a concrete wall along Interstate 95. Several major and minor roads were also inundated by water in Wellington. Additionally, there was flooding at the intersections of Meadow Avenue and Greenview Shores Boulevard, and Indian Mound Road and South Shore Boulevard. Heavy rainfall left several leaking roofs at an apartment complex in Pahokee.|$|E

25|$|The {{improvements}} were successful, and {{the small}} <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> soon completely overwhelmed by an ever-increasing number of visitors to the sign. In April 2012, the Clark County Commission authorized the expenditure of $500,000 to add 20 more spaces to accommodate visitor traffic.|$|E

25|$|On August 2, 2014, it was {{revealed}} that a municipal parking lot at Broome and Essex Streets would be closed for soil testing and for planning of the future Warhol museum. Groundbreaking for the crossing was said to come as early as spring 2015, though a definite groundbreaking timeline has not been published. On December 31, another <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> closed, this time a private one on Suffolk Street.|$|E
25|$|Boyd, {{the last}} person to see Heitholt alive in the <b>parking</b> <b>lot,</b> <b>was</b> also called as a witness.

25|$|From 1981 {{until the}} 1990s, Littleton was the {{turnback}} {{point for a}} limited number of trains. Its <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> just 40 spaces, insufficient for demand. In 1995, local officials proposed building a new station on a state highway parcel off Route 2A, as the Foster Street site was considered too rural for a garage. However, at the time, the MBTA was focused on reactivating the Old Colony Lines and was not adding parking to existing stations.|$|E
50|$|Green <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> <b>are</b> {{a form of}} <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> {{designed}} to <b>be</b> environmentally more sustainable. Both the City of Toronto, Canada and the United States Environmental Protection Agency have released standards as to what will be considered a green <b>parking</b> <b>lot.</b> According to the Toronto guidelines {{the purpose of a}} green <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>is</b> to use all the left over spaces in <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> in more environmentally friendly manners and also to make changes to <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> that, without interfering with their ability to serve as a <b>parking</b> <b>lot,</b> do not have as great of a negative effect on the environment.
