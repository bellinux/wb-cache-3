5|$|The second {{classification}} was {{the points}} classification. Riders received points for finishing {{among the highest}} placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type.

For 2011, flat stages had just one intermediate sprint which was worth 20 <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the rider in first position, and the first 15 score points. The intention was to have riders needing to sprint twice during the day to score well. Points awarded at the finish of flat stages also increased, from 35 points for the winner to 45. Medium mountain stages awarded 30 <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the winner, high mountain stages and the individual time trial gave 20 points. No points were awarded for the team time trial on stage two.
