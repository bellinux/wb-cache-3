5000|$|Under the {{principle}} of [...] "Barrier Free Environment", the idea of [...] "priority seats" [...] was first introduced in northern Europe. Providing unimpeded, effortless access and ideal living environment to all people is the final goal. Over the past centuries, the idea of priority seats spread to Asian countries such as Japan, Taiwan and Korea. These three are the most significant examples due to their cultural emphasis on politeness that teaches the younger generation to offer seats to the elderly. Failing {{to do so would}} be regarded as disrespectful. Countries such as Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and China have similar traditions. In addition, some countries may require passengers to show their <b>priority</b> <b>seat</b> cards to prove they are eligible, for instance the Southern Railway and National Rail of Britain.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two major}} controversies {{regarding}} <b>priority</b> <b>seats.</b> First of all, people think that only people in need can sit on the <b>priority</b> <b>seats.</b> Even if the train is full, <b>priority</b> <b>seats</b> are still left empty. This situation is common in Taiwan and Hong Kong. People, especially young people, {{are not willing to}} sit on the train as they afraid of being morally criticized, scolded or even cyberbullied (like uploading their scenes of occupying <b>priority</b> <b>seats</b> to social networking websites). However, the <b>priority</b> <b>seats</b> are first-come-first-served. <b>Priority</b> <b>seats</b> are designed to promote the culture of offering seats to the needy. If there are no needy on the public transport, people are free to sit on the <b>priority</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In Hong Kong, <b>Priority</b> <b>seats</b> {{were first}} {{introduced}} in the MTR in 2009 with the [...] "Priority Seats Campaign". The Smiley World Characters, large red stickers with big smiley faces, were stuck {{on the top of}} the <b>priority</b> <b>seats</b> so as to attract people’s attention.|$|R

50|$|Going {{into the}} 2015 general {{election}} Tracey campaigned on local issues, notably the George Eliot Hospital, {{the plans for}} the HS2 railway through North Warwickshire, road safety, protecting Warwickshire's green belt, supporting local schools, and the need for improvements to high-speed broadband. He also supported Conservative plans for a referendum on European Union membership. With a majority of 54 in the 2010 general election, Labour targeted North Warwickshire as a top <b>priority</b> <b>seat,</b> and bookies predicted that Labour's Mike O'Brien would retake the constituency from the Conservatives after losing it in 2010. However, Tracey secured an increased majority for his party, from 54 to 2,973, winning 20,042 votes, compared to 17,069 for O'Brien. The result represented a 3% swing away from Labour to the Conservatives. The majority increase for the Conservatives in North Warwickshire was largely prompted by a surge in support for the UK Independence Party (UKIP), which took votes away from the Labour Party in a traditionally working class area of former mining villages. UKIP, whose candidate for the constituency was William Cash, the son of Conservative MP Bill Cash, came third with 8,256 votes.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the setup}} of {{priority}} seats in MTR, bus companies started to follow. Priority seats {{were introduced to}} the Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) in May 2011, and then followed by Citybus and New World First Bus (NWFB) in June 2012. In accordance with the press releases, the KMB first introduced priority seats to 87 of their buses. In each bus, several priority seats were located {{at the front of the}} lower deck. The headrests of such seats are in green with words of [...] "PRIORITY SEAT" [...] and symbols of elderly, handicapped, pregnant women, and people with infants or young children to help passengers identify them. Advertisements were also broadcast in order to raise the awareness of passengers to offer seats. Receiving positive and supportive feedback after the 6-month trial, in the year 2012, the KMB decided to have priority seats set up in all of its buses and the headrests of such seats were changed into dark purple. According to press releases from the government, for the minibus, <b>priority</b> <b>seat</b> is provided at the first single seat near the door. And for the tram, there are a few priority seats offered near the driver in the lower deck. Also, there is priority seating offered by the Cathay Pacific airline, for passengers with disabilities. But since other transportations such as taxi and ferry which usually do not allow standing, there are no specifically designated priority seats.|$|E

5000|$|Keiō {{was among}} the first railway {{companies}} to introduce <b>priority</b> <b>seats</b> on its trains. <b>Priority</b> <b>seats</b> are those reserved for the physically handicapped, elderly, pregnant women, and people with infants. These special seats, which were initially called [...] "Silver seats" [...] but renamed in 1993, were inaugurated on Respect for the Aged Day on September 15, 1973.|$|R
50|$|<b>Priority</b> <b>seats</b> motivate {{people to}} offer seats {{to people with}} special need. Taking the {{initiative}} to give seats to them can prevent them from accidents when travelling on public transports. According to the Press Release of The Kowloon Motor Bus in 2011, <b>priority</b> <b>seats</b> are designed to provide people with special need a safe and enjoyable journey. Such passengers, including the elderly and people with mobility obstacles, may face special inconvenience and difficulties during travelling. Introducing <b>priority</b> <b>seats</b> encourages individuals to bear the social responsibility of caring for others in need. According to the Press Release of The Kowloon Motor Bus in 2011, promotion of <b>priority</b> <b>seats</b> aims to enhance the awareness of offering seats to the people with special need so as to cultivate a culture of care. The motion encourages people to be sensitive about other people's needs and take actions of empathy and altruism.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Priority</b> <b>seats</b> {{have been}} {{designated}} in public transport vehicles by certain transport operators to allow elderly, disabled, {{pregnant women and}} the injured to ride public transport with an equal degree of access and comfort as normal people. <b>Priority</b> <b>seats</b> {{can be found on}} various public transportation, including the mass transit railways, buses, minibuses, and trams.
