50|$|<b>Point</b> <b>bars</b> {{are simply}} an {{accumulation}} of deposited alluvium that collects on the inside bank of a meander curve. This accumulation occurs due to the stream's lower velocity in the interior portion of the curve. In accordance with the Hjulström curve, sediment will settle more readily at lower velocities. <b>Point</b> <b>bars</b> typically are composed of sediment {{ranging in size from}} pebbles to granular sands. Only in still water do silt particles settle.The development of <b>point</b> <b>bars</b> is suggested to depend upon a sufficient suspended load so that finer-grained sediments may be deposited on the inner bank.|$|R

50|$|The <b>point</b> <b>bar</b> {{typically}} has a gently {{sloping floor}} with shallow water. The shallow water is mostly the accumulated boundary layer {{and does not}} have a fast speed. However, in the deepest parts of the stream where the stream is flowing freely, vortex flow prevails and the stream is flowing fastest where the radius of the bend is smallest, and slowest where the radius is greatest. The shallows around the <b>point</b> <b>bar</b> can become treacherous when the stream is rising. As the water depth increases over the shallows of the <b>point</b> <b>bar,</b> the vortex flow can extend closer toward the convex bank and the water speed at any point can increase dramatically in response to only a small increase in water depth.|$|E

40|$|Meandering {{channels}} constitute one of {{the fundamental}} components of tidal systems, as related tidal <b>point</b> <b>bars</b> are ubiquitous features in lagoonal or estuarine sedimentary successions. Nevertheless, a limited number of studies analyzed their morphodynamic evolution, together with their planimetric shape and morphometric characteristics. Their internal architecture and sedimentary facies distribution are relatively unexplored, and commonly investigated using facies models developed for fluvial meander bends. Focusing on differences, more than on similarities, between tidal and fluvial meanders, the present work aims at investigating the stratal architecture and sedimentary facies distribution of selected tidal <b>point</b> <b>bars</b> in the Venice Lagoon (Adriatic Sea, Italy). Three main issue were investigate by the present work: i) the role of low order tributaries in controlling the evolution of tidal meander bend; ii) the influence of salt marsh aggradation in shaping geometries of tidal <b>point</b> <b>bars,</b> iii) sedimentary process and morphodynamics changes acting on subtidal <b>point</b> <b>bars.</b> The morphodynamic evolution of tidal channels, and related sedimentary products, were analyzed using a multidisciplinary approach, which comprises the comparison of historical photos, the interpretation of high-resolution sub-bottom profiles, core logging analysis and 3 D modelling. The main results stemmed out form the study sites highlight that: I) lateral tributaries can strongly influence the evolution of bends modifying local mechanisms of sediment and flow distribution; II); the migration of tidal <b>point</b> <b>bars</b> occurs under aggradational conditions both in intertidal and subtidal setting; III) subtidal bars evolve under the strong interaction between wave and tidal currents. ...|$|R

50|$|Point {{bars are}} {{composed}} of sediment that is well sorted and typically reflects the overall capacity of the stream. They also have a very gentle slope and an elevation very close to water level. Since they are low-lying, they are often overtaken by floods and can accumulate driftwood and other debris during times of high water levels. Due to their near flat topography {{and the fact that}} the water speed is slow in the shallows of the <b>point</b> <b>bar</b> they are popular rest stops for boaters and rafters. However, camping on a <b>point</b> <b>bar</b> can be dangerous as a flash flood that raises the stream level by as little as a few inches (centimetres) can overwhelm a campsite in moments.|$|E

Reservoirs in <b>point</b> <b>bars</b> of {{meandering}} channels {{account for}} a high proportion in oil and gas reservoirs, with much impact of complicated architecture on remaining oil accumulation and distribution. Thus study on inner architecture of <b>point</b> <b>bars</b> {{and its impact on}} remaining oil distribution are important. This paper selects Unit III in Block A in Daqing Oilfield with data in filled well patterns and cores to study inner architecture of subsurface single sand bodies, and analyzes 3 D structural features of meandering <b>point</b> <b>bars</b> in Xingbei deltaic plain in Daqing Placanticline. Architecture parameters of lateral accretion shale interbeds are: eastward dip averagely 7 °, the upper, middle and lower dip in same accretion face are respectively 10 °, 7 ° and 3 °, the width is 15 - 42 m. They are vertically imbricated series and areally corner points of abandoned channels on both sides of meandering rings as track collection intersections, and progressive and curvature reducing arc sets with abandoned channels of meandering rings as outer boundary. This pattern provides geologic basis for successive study on remaining oil...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Bars {{which form}} on the convex side of bends in Antelope Creek in eastern Wyoming superficially {{resemble}} <b>point</b> <b>bars</b> but have neither the genesis nor internal structure of true <b>point</b> <b>bars</b> in meandering perennial streams. Our observations of sediments in this shallow, sandy, ephemeral stream suggest that these bars are a function of "flashy " flow and large width-depth ratios which prohibit strong lateral flows related to helical cells. Apparently, sediment istransported parallel to downslream velocity vectors. During high flow, a large sediment mass is emplaced in the channel bend where flow expansion causes deposition. Further deposition takes place by vertical accretion as flows continue to overtop the bar. Subsequent low flows cause erosion of the bar by thalweg meandering and chute channel development, and deposition of fine material takes place in chute channels and on the bar margin. These processes result {{in the creation of}} a side bar with internal structure consisting of a main flood fill sediment body and vertically accreted topset beds with minor marginal foreset strata. A thin veneer of low-water fine sediment may occur on the outer bar margin and in chute channels. We suggest that hese bars should be distinguished from true <b>point</b> <b>bars</b> and other types of side bars and herein propose the descriptive term convex bar...|$|R
