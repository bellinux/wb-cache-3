40|$|This study {{focuses on}} <b>personnel</b> <b>managers</b> in crisis situations. The interviewed <b>personnel</b> <b>managers</b> {{referred}} to emotions {{as a central}} element {{to be dealt with}} in a crisis. However, until recently, the exploration of emotions in organisational life has been de-emphasised or ignored. This study aims to bring to the surface aspects of personnel work that have so far been neglected or remained invisible. It specifically examines how <b>personnel</b> <b>managers</b> handle employees’ and their own emotions in a crisis. Based on the interviews, a number of emotional episodes were constructed. They describe the type and context of the crisis and the person(s) whose emotions are handled. The main findings of the study are the five emotion-handling strategies that could be constructed from the data. The negotiation-like manner in which <b>personnel</b> <b>managers</b> handled emotions in crisis situations proved especially interesting. They were actually negotiating emotional value for their organisations. Further, they handled their own emotions within the frame of two logics of appropriateness labelled mothering and guide-following. The episodes described also enabled identification of the values enacted by the <b>personnel</b> <b>managers</b> in handling emotions. The study provides descriptive information on emotion handling, a current and relevant feature in the practice of personnel management. It seeks to offer a frame for developing practical principles that can be helpful in a crisis. It also offers the opportunity to consider a variety of difficult situations that <b>personnel</b> <b>managers</b> may confront in their work...|$|R

40|$|<b>Personnel</b> <b>managers</b> in {{different}} firms, industries and countries {{do not hold}} the same preferences for job applicant attributes. This research was aimed at understanding the cause {{of some of these}} differences. Survey questionnaires were sent to <b>personnel</b> <b>managers</b> in Norway (N = 195) and Quebec (N = 172). The <b>personnel</b> <b>managers</b> were asked to rate: (1) aspects related to their firms' organizational characteristics (business environment, strategy, and structure), and (2) the importance of different personality traits for applicants to managerial and professional positions. Consistent with earlier research (Rynes & Gerhart, 1990) the results indicate that preferences for different applicant attributes represent shared perceptions due to common organizational membership. These preferences are to some degree related to company strategy, organizational structure and national culture. In general, it was found that <b>personnel</b> <b>managers</b> currently seek candidates who can adapt to change and generate new ideas. The results are discussed in light of theories from industrial/organizational and cross-cultural psychology, and suggestions for further research are offered...|$|R

A rich older admirer of June, Roland Freedman, paid her to write the novel; she would show him pages of Miller's work each week, pretending it was hers. The book went unpublished until 1992, 65 years after it was written and 12 years after Miller’s death. Moloch is based on Miller’s first marriage, to Beatrice, and his years working as a <b>personnel</b> <b>manager</b> at the Western Union office in Lower Manhattan. A third novel written around this time, Crazy Cock, also went unpublished until after Miller's death. Initially titled Lovely Lesbians, Crazy Cock (along with his later novel Nexus) told the story of June's close relationship with the artist Marion, whom June had renamed Jean Kronski. Kronski lived with Miller and June from 1926 until 1927, when June and Kronski went to Paris together, leaving Miller behind, which upset him greatly. Miller suspected the pair of having a lesbian relationship. While in Paris, June and Kronski did not get along, and June returned to Miller several months later.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to provide {{educators}} with empirical information on the qualifications <b>personnel</b> <b>managers</b> expect from entry-level employees. The study also compared school officials' rankings of employment qualifications of high school graduates with qualifications found by business <b>personnel</b> <b>managers</b> when selecting entry-level workers. The data collection process involved a card sort technique utilizing two decks of cards. Surveys were mailed to Indiana public school superintendents, high school principals, public school board presidents, and business <b>personnel</b> <b>managers.</b> A total of 1924 surveys were mailed with 528 ranked surveys returned. Six null hypotheses were two-way comparisons of desired entry-level qualifications and current entry-level qualifications. Ten null hypotheses compared desired qualifications with current entry-level qualifications. There was little agreement among the respondents or respondent groups regarding the most desired or currently found entry-level qualifications. All respondent groups ranked science and technology, social and economic studies, and writing as the least found qualifications. <b>Personnel</b> <b>managers</b> ranked science and technology as the most desired entry-level qualification. School officials ranked this qualification as one of the least desired entry-level qualification. If educators are to prepare students to meet the challenges of entry-level employment, general expectations must be developed that are acceptable to a variety of employers. Only through collaborative efforts between business and school officials will entry-level qualifications be developed that have meaning to both groups. Until that collaboration occurs, educators willcontinue to rely on their own beliefs as they prepare students for entrance into the world of work. Department of Educational LeadershipThesis (D.
