40|$|The passive elastic {{properties}} of the mantle of the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis have been characterized in experiments on intact mantle and on pieces cut from the mantle. The mantle {{was found to be}} very compliant over a wide range of circumferential strains, corresponding to a change in mantle circumferential strain of 0. 45. Beyond this range of strain, the mantle was much stiffer, in both the circumferential direction, 0. 542 +/- 0. 025 MPa (mean +/- s. e. m., N= 51) and through the thickness of the mantle wall, 0. 152 +/- 0. 041 MPa (N= 11). Almost 80 % of the work done on the tissue during compression in the circumferential direction was recovered during elastic recoil of the tissue; this elastic work could contribute to refilling the mantle after a jet. Our estimates of the work done during a cycle of jetting and refilling show that such elastic work is small (approximately 1 %) compared with the contractile work done by the circular muscle fibres. However, although the elastic work is almost negligible in the overall energy budget, it is <b>probably</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>to</b> <b>power</b> refilling of the mantl...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Statistical {{arguments}} {{show that}} the volume- and time-averaged kinetic power of GRBs and fireball transients (FTs) into an L ∗ galaxy like the Milky Way is {{at the level of}} 10 40 ergs s − 1. This number, though with wide uncertainties related to the internal or external shock efficiency, is <b>sufficient</b> <b>to</b> <b>power</b> hadronic cosmic rays observed locally. The release of energy by the high-mass progenitor stars of GRBs and FTs is <b>sufficient</b> <b>to</b> <b>power</b> the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays, as already shown by Waxman and Vietri in 1995. It is <b>sufficient</b> <b>to</b> <b>power</b> the cosmic rays above the knee of the cosmic-ray spectrum. Indeed, all hadronic cosmic rays could originate from the high-mass (> ∼ 100 M⊙) stars that collapse to black holes, in the process forming GRBs and FTs. This source class represents a new {{solution to the problem of}} cosmic-ray origin. The ∼ 10 4 - 10 7 black holes made by these stars could make their presence known by radiating as they accrete from the ISM, by microlensing background radiations, and by forming luminous binary systems. Some unidentified EGRET sources could be isolated black holes that accrete from the ISM. Better imaging and sensitivity with GLAST and TeV observatories will test this model for the unidentified γ-ray sources, and this theory for cosmic-ray origin. ...|$|R

50|$|Death of the {{conceptus}} probably {{results from}} the collective damage by the virus {{to a variety of}} tissues and organs, including the placenta. However, {{in the absence of an}} immune response, changes in almost any vital organ are <b>probably</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>to</b> eventually cause death. One of the most striking features of viral distribution is the extensive involvement of endothelium. This seems to preclude further development of the vascular network of the conceptus. Preparation for cellular mitosis (i.e., the S phase) results in concomitant viral replication and cell death. Damage to the fetal circulatory system is indicated by edema, hemorrhage, and the accumulation of large amounts of serosanguineous fluids in body cavities. Necrosis of the endothelium is microscopically evident.|$|R

40|$|Stages in {{the life}} of corpora lutea may be divided logically into formation, {{function}} and regression. Mechanisms controlling each stage may be independent or overlapping depending on the species. Anderson et al.,(4) have pointed to lack of current evidence to allow a clear distinction between luteinizing hormone (LH) and luteotropic hormone (LTH) in farm animals. Initial LTH release is <b>probably</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>to</b> form and maintain the corpora lutea for the normal estrous cycle (Aldred et al., 1). Maintenance of corpora lutea for the normal duration of an estrous cycle in hypophysectomized ewes (Denamur and Mauleon, 6) and sows (du Mesnil du Buisson and Leglise, 19) supports this theory.
