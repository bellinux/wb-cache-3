40|$|Abstract Background Oct 4 and Sox 2 are {{two major}} {{transcription}} factors related to the stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the association between Oct 4 and Sox 2 expression levels with both the clinicopathological characteristics and <b>prognoses</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Method Tumor tissue samples from 85 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma were collected, and the clinical follow-up data <b>of</b> these <b>patients</b> were recorded, and expression status of Oct 4 and Sox 2 were examined in these tissue samples by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results Oct 4 expression was found to be an independent predictive factor for overall survival (p = 0. 004) in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and was independently related to loco-regional control (p = 0. 001). Although Sox 2 expression status showed no significant association with overall survival (p = 0. 166), disease-free survival (p = 0. 680) or loco-regional control (p = 0. 383), when using a subgroup analysis, the subgroup with both high Oct 4 and Sox 2 expression had the best prognosis (p = 0. 000). Sox 2 expression could be a potential prognostic predictor for <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Simultaneous analyses of Oct 4 and Sox 2 expression could be more effective in evaluating the <b>prognoses</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Conclusion Oct 4 expression is an independent predictive factor for <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting that Oct 4 expression may be a useful indicator for predicting the <b>prognosis</b> <b>of</b> hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{recently}} cloned novel p 150 protein {{was found}} to be overexpressed in human breast carcinoma. To the authors' knowledge, no data on p 150 expression in any other human tumors have been published previously. METHODS: To investigate whether the expression of p 150 correlated with the clinicopathologic stages of cervical neoplasms or the <b>prognoses</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> these neoplasms, the authors conducted an immunohistochemical study of archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded specimens. Seventy-two precancerous lesions (CIN), 75 clinical Stage IB invasive squamous carcinomas, and 20 samples of normal squamous epithelia were included. In addition to p 150, the Ki- 67 labeling index was assessed as a proliferation parameter. The presence of human papillomavirus was analyzed by in situ DNA hybridization. RESULTS: A significant association of p 150 with the grade of atypia in cervical neoplasms was demonstrated. The highest expression of p 150 was observed in low grade CIN, with subsequently decreasing expression in high grade CIN and invasive carcinoma. For <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> invasive carcinoma, p 150 was significantly correlated <b>with</b> clinical outcome. <b>Patients</b> <b>with</b> high expression <b>of</b> p 150 had a better prognosis than those with low p 150. Those with regional lymph node metastasis and significant p 150 expression had longer relapse free survival than those with insignificant p 150 expression. Women whose carcinomas demonstrated vascular space invasion or high microvessel density survived longer when p 150 was clearly expressed. p 150 behaves as a potential tumor marker during early cervical carcinoma development and is later turned off as cells proceed to more advanced stages of their malignant phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: p 150 is a molecular parameter that might become useful in predicting disease progression and determining the <b>prognoses</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> invasive cervical carcinoma...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This article {{investigates the}} methods of {{achieving}} deep remission of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Increasing recognition {{of the concept of}} quality of care is contributing to the evolution of treatment goals in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> IBD from clinical response and remission (symptom control) toward deep remission. A change in the treatment goal requires a change in the treatment strategy. Optimization of conventional therapy, early treatment, use of the Lemann score, performance of double-balloon endoscopy, treatment using Traditional Chinese Medicine, and good communication between physicians and patients are needed to attain deep remission. RESULTS: The above-mentioned methods can help to achieve deep remission. CONCLUSION: Using the above methods, {{it will be possible to}} improve the <b>prognoses</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> IBD by minimizing complications and bowel damage and thereby changing the course of the disease...|$|R
30|$|With {{regard to}} {{adjuvant}} chemotherapy for ALNM, only two {{cases have been}} reported according to our literature search [4, 5]. A <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> solitary cecum cancer ALNM received chemotherapy with FOLFIRI and radiation therapy to the left axillary fossa following lymph node resection and survived without recurrence for 12  months [5]. On the other hand, another <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> ALNM with cervical node metastasis received chemotherapy after resection of both lymph nodes and died from recurrence 9  months after surgery [4]. In the present case, the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy and has had no signs of recurrence for the 5  months after ALNM resection. Although {{it is unclear whether}} adjuvant chemotherapy improves the <b>prognoses</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> colon cancer ALNM, we believe that surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy would be a potent treatment for solitary colon cancer ALNM.|$|R

50|$|Trilateral {{retinoblastoma}} (TRb) is {{a malignant}} midline primitive neuroectodermal tumor occurring {{in patients with}} inherited uni- or bilateral retinoblastoma. In most cases trilateral retinoblastoma presents itself as pineoblastoma (pineal TRb). In about a fourth of the cases the tumor develops in another intracranial region, most commonly supra- or parasellar (non-pineal TRb), but there are reported cases with non-pineal TRb in the 3rd ventricle. In most cases pineal TRb is diagnosed {{before the age of}} 5, but after the diagnosis of retinoblastoma. Non-pineal TRb, however, is often diagnosed simultaneous with retinoblastoma. <b>Prognosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> trilateral retinoblastoma is dismal, only a few patients have survived more than 5 years after diagnosis; all survivors were diagnosed with small tumors in a subclinical stage.

50|$|There {{is ongoing}} {{discussion}} regarding the best management regarding the optimal surgical procedure for papillary thyroid cancer. <b>Prognosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> papillary thyroid cancer {{is found to}} be dependent on the patient's age, the size of the tumor, presence of metastatic disease, and the presence of tumor invasion into adjacent tissues near the thyroid gland. Recent studies have examined a more conservative approach to surgery and have demonstrated that hemithyroidectomy may be acceptable for patients with low-risk papillary thyroid cancer with tumor size 1 cm to 4 cm with no presence of invasion to tissues surrounding the thyroid or metastasis. Studies examining large databases of patients with papillary thyroid cancer have concluded that there is no survival advantage for patients with stage I papillary thyroid cancer size 1-4 cm receiving total thyroidectomy versus hemithyroidectomy. In light of this data, choosing the optimal course of surgical and medical management of papillary thyroid cancer should involve shared decision making from patient, endocrinologists, and surgeons.|$|E

40|$|Antibiotics have {{dramatically}} changed the <b>prognoses</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> severe infectious diseases {{over the past}} 50 years. However, the emergence and dissemination of resistant organisms has endangered the effectiveness of antibiotics. One possible approach to the resistance problem is the appropriate use of antibiotic drugs for preventing and treating infections.

At each specific level-cultural, contextual, and behavioural-we discuss the determinants that influence hospital antibiotic use and the possible improvement strategies {{to make it more}} appropriate. Changing hospital antibiotic use is a challenge of formidable complexity. On each level, many determinants play a part, so that the measures or strategies undertaken to improve antibiotic use need to be equally diverse. Although various strategies for improving antibiotic use are available, a programme with activities at all three levels is needed for hospitals.
