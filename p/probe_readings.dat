40|$|ABSTRACT Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} diagnosed disorder in children today and {{has been the subject}} of great public and academic debate for over a decade. Whilst much of this debate has focussed on clearly defining the disorder and determining its prevalence, in more recent years, research has begun to focus on successful interventions for overcoming the myriad of poor outcomes experienced by children with ADHD. The majority of intervention research, however, has concentrated on medical and behavioural approaches with very little attention being given to the impact of educational and/or academic interventions. Because children with ADHD are at two to three times greater risk of school failure than their peers without ADHD, it is essential that research focuses on educational approaches within school and classroom environments to address this problem. The purpose of the present research was to investigate the academic, social and behavioural differences over time of children diagnosed with ADHD in a Flexible Learning Centre through case studies of five adolescents aged 13 to 17 years who, for a variety of reasons, had been excluded from, denied access to, or had chosen to reject mainstream education. Data for the case studies were collected by means of archival records and recollections, naturalistic observations of the young people in the flexible learning environment, and interviews with the young people and their parents to explore the perceptions of themselves over time and to what they attributed any changes that may have occurred. Moreover, participants were administered a series of tests at two time intervals (approximately nine months apart) focussing on academic achievement (the <b>PROBE</b> <b>Reading</b> test, South Australian Spelling test, Test of Whole Number Computation), self-perception (the Self-Descriptive Questionnaire II) and behavioural outcomes (the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire). Using these multiple forms of data collection, within-case and cross-case analyses were adopted to determine themes, trends, and patterns to support or refute the study questions. Findings from the study indicated that over time there were improvements in the social and behavioural outcomes for the five participants but academic progress was limited. This thesis will explore these and other findings from the study and suggest possible reasons for the findings and implications for future research...|$|R
40|$|LectureStandard {{centrifugal}} compressors {{are designed to}} process gas with limited liquid content: significant presence of liquid {{may be responsible for}} the rapid erosion and corrosion of both static and rotating components that yield to higher failure risk and shorter maintenance periods. Moreover the presence of liquid is associated to significant modifications of machine performance and machine operability. However, the possibility of compressing gas containing non negligible amounts of liquid allows to reduce size, dimensions and costs of the liquid removal stations with a consequent positive impact on the layout of subsea compression stations. With this aim, the OEM has developed a family of centrifugal impellers, the Wet Tolerant Impellers (WTI), specifically designed to process gas containing non negligible amounts of liquid, increasing the erosion resistance and promoting the liquid droplets breakup for subsequent stages. ?The validation of WTI has been carried out at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim; the test rig is a single stage air-water multiphase open-loop facility driven by a 450 kW motor capable of a maximum continuous speed equal to 11000 rpm. ?In the test campaign, first a standard impeller has been tested {{to assess the impact of}} liquid phase on performance and operating range (results have been summarized in Ferrara et al. [14]), then the specific WTI design has been tested and directly compared with the standard impeller results. The comparative test campaign has been focused on three different aspects: Performance evaluation in dry and wet conditions; Operating range evaluation in dry and wet conditions; Comparative erosion test. ?WTI test results have been compared with the performance curves obtained through the OEM internal tool specifically developed for the prediction of {{centrifugal compressors}} performance in wet conditions. Performance has been assessed varying the amount of liquid carried by the gas at two different rotating speeds: five Liquid Mass Fractions (LMF) have been considered for each speedline and a minimum of six test points have been recorded from partflow to overflow.

And on the other hand on the prompt ionospheric response to the EUV ionization, which signature (in terms of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems -GNSSSolar Flare Activity Indicator, GSFLAI) is accurately measured in real-time from the existing global networks of dual-frequency GNSS receivers, and with a time resolution higher that those of dedicated space probes. Moreover the sensitivity of this approach enables the detection of not only extreme X-class flares, but also the detection of variations of one order of magnitude lower or even smaller (such as for M-class flares) : 100 % successful detection for all the X-class solar flares during 2000 - 2006 with registered location outside of the solar limb (i. e. detection of 94 % of all of X-class solar-flares) and about 65 % for M-class ones, obtained with the associated SISTED detector.

From the experiments the obtained effective porosity ranged from 0. 28 to 0. 29 for wetting from the top with an average of 0. 287 and 0. 29 to 0. 30 for wetting from the bottom with an average of 0. 293. The determined effective porosity ranged from 71. 7 - 73. 3 % of the real initial porosity of 0. 40 of the river sand. The maximum attained degree of saturation during the experiment was 91 %. The results indicated that the method will be suitable and useful in determining the effective porosity of medium grained unsaturated soils...|$|R
40|$|Experimental setup The {{observation}} setup involved two microclimatological {{stations that}} were {{installed in the}} Rabbit Hills solar array, OSU campus Oregon; one in and open area {{and the other in}} the solar array. The soil moisture was quantified using a complimentary system of electronic sensors and neutron <b>probe</b> <b>readings.</b> Soil moisture beneath the solar array was significantly higher. Photo voltaic solar energy is a clean source of energy with much lower carbon footprint than other sources. Abstract However, the vast land requirements of solar energy arrays may make installation impractical when available land is better suited for other purposes. The goal of this research was to investigate changes to the environmental physics, grass production, and grass species diversification under solar panels in an active pasture. To this end, different land characteristics were studied observationally including the length of the growing season, the greenness, the production per acre), and the environmental physical processes...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{capacitance}} sensors {{is one of}} {{the methods}} used to quantitatively measure soil water contents (theta, m³ m- 3). Sensors provide readings at desired depths and time intervals. A capacitance probe (Diviner 2000) was calibrated for a Rhodic Paleudult from the Piaui State, Brazil. Six access tubes were installed in a 5 × 2 m grid arrangement. Three moisture levels (saturated, moist and dry) were used in two replications. <b>Probe</b> <b>readings</b> and soil samplings to determine theta were made at 0. 1 m depth intervals down to a depth of 1. 0 m. A power calibration equation was developed for each depth {{as well as for the}} entire soil profile (Root Mean Square Error = 0. 014, R² = 0. 93) for a theta range of 0. 068 to 0. 264 m³m- 3. A separate calibration for each depth improves the correlation coefficient and minimizes RMSE. Site-specific calibration improves the accuracy for soil water monitoring...|$|E
40|$|In the {{semi-arid}} Succulent Karoo {{water is}} one of the most limiting resources, and plants that survive in the area require competitive water-use strategies suited to long periods of drought. Over the years much emphasis has been put on mechanisms that allow for the competitive success of water-use strategies, and root structure features as an important attribute. This study investigated soil drying cycles in the semiarid Succulent Karoo. It measured the rates at which soil water was depleted at two different depths in five different microhabitats, and investigated whether these are related to different rooting systems. Three prevalent plant species in the region were used, namely Leipoldtia schultzei of the Mesembryanthemaceae, Tripteris sinuata of the Asteraceae, and Galenia africana of the Aizoaceae, all of which have their roots in the upper 20 cm of soil. However, Leipoldtia's roots are concentrated in the top 5 cm of soil, while the other two species root mainly at depths between 10 and 20 cm. This vertical separation of roots provided the opportunity to relate soil water depletion at two different depths (0 - 10 cm and 10 - 20 cm) to the different rooting strategies, and explore what this means in te 1 ms of compatibility between close neighbours and seedling establishment under adult plants. The shallow-rooting Leipoldtia showed the highest rates of soil moisture depletion in both the shallow and deeper soil zones, and is therefore a strong competitor for water and probably an undesirable neighbour. Soils at both depths below Tripteris plants maintained the highest moisture content over the 2 -week period of sampling, suggesting it to be favourable site for seedling establishment. Galenia showed intermediate soil-drying effects in the upper 0 - 10 cm, but high rates of moisture depletion at 1 0 - 20 cm below the surface, suggesting that it may be a suitable neighbour for shallow-rooting species but not for other deeper rooting species. Additionally, the two sampling methods - electronic <b>probe</b> <b>readings</b> and gravimetric analysis - were examined. The two methods correlated fairly well to each other (R 2 = 0. 759 ± 0. 002), although the <b>probe</b> <b>readings</b> were consistently higher and showed greater variation (probe SD = 2. 8 as opposed to gravimetric SD = 1. 2...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Carcinoma in situ is an {{aggressive}} form of bladder cancer {{with a high}} propensity for invasion if left untreated. On cystoscopy these flat lesions cannot be differentiated from other erythematous, potentially benign areas and they require biopsy for definitive diagnosis. Other methods of detecting carcinoma in situ remain experimental. We assessed the effectiveness of electrical impedance spectroscopy, a method that measures the variation of electrical current flow with frequency through the mucosa, for differentiating various pathological changes in the urothelium. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained 250 impedance measurements immediately after resection in 35 cystectomy specimens using a custom designed <b>probe.</b> Three consecutive <b>readings</b> were recorded per point to assess reproducibility and punch biopsy was done at the measurement site. RESULTS: Changes in the urothelium were classified histologically into 7 subgroups according {{to the degree of}} edema and inflammation. Electrical impedance spectroscopy measurements were able to separate benign and malignant changes when tested as a group (p < 0. 001), although some individual points overlapped. Edema also had a significant effect on tissue impedance (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Using measurements we established patterns of electrical impedance in the human bladder. Early results suggest that this minimally invasive technique is able to differentiate benign and malignant bladder pathologies. However, it requires further refinement and evaluation at lower frequencies, where the greatest impedance difference in benign and malignant tissues is expected...|$|R
40|$|Background {{information}} The {{principal aim}} of periodontal treatment consists amongst others in scaling plaque and calculus {{of the root}} surfaces. The intention is to remove the source of periodontal pathogenic bacteria. Despite scaling and root-planning several {{studies have shown that}} a great deal of residual subgingival calculus remains undetected. In recent years in vitro studies have proven the effectiveness of laser-fluorescence to distinguish calculus from dentin and enamel. In consideration of the studies no significant differences between media like saline salt solution, blood and saliva within the analyses were made. There are no scientific papers about the application of laser fluorescence in vitro. Thus a comparison of the efficiency of laser-fluorescence to detect subgingival calculus and the classical periodontal probe methods efficiency will be drawn. Material and method Measurements with a periodontal probe and laser-fluorescence were taken on the mesial and distal root-surfaces of 15 teeth. For each <b>probed</b> region, five <b>readings</b> were obtained and categorized based on the presence of calculus. For various reasons these teeth had to be extracted. After the extraction the visual control of the sites was compared to the probing and laser findings. These results were cross-checked based on their significance and specificity. Results In summary, the laser fluorescence is significantly superior to the classical periodontal probe method in vivo (p< 0. 001). This result applies both to specific teeth surfaces and to particular teeth groups like incisors, premolars and molars. This research confirms results of previously released in vitro studies. In conclusion, one can say that laser fluorescence represents a recommendable option in detecting remaining calculus...|$|R
40|$|Microcirculatory {{blood flow}} can be {{measured}} using a laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) <b>probe.</b> However, the <b>readings</b> are affected by tissue optical properties (absorption and scattering coefficient; µa and µs) and probe geometry. In this study the influence of optical properties (µa∈[0. 053, 0. 23] mm- 1; µs∈[14. 7, 45. 7] mm- 1) on LDF perfusion and sampling depth were evaluated for different fiber separations. In-vitro measurements were made on a sophisticated tissue phantom with known optical properties, mimicking blood flow at different depths. Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to extend the geometry of the tissue phantom. A good correlation between measured and simulated data was found. The simulations showed that, for a fixed flow at a discrete depth, the influence of µs or µa on the LDF perfusion increased with increasing flow depth and decreased with increasing fiber separation. For a homogeneous flow distribution, however, the perfusion varied 40 % due to the variations in optical properties, almost independent of fiber separation (0. 23 - 1. 61 mm). Therefore, the effect in real tissue is likely to vary due to the unknown heterogeneous blood flow distribution. Further, LDF sampling depth increased with decreasing µs or µa and increasing fiber separation. For a fiber separation of 0. 46 mm, the e- 1 sampling depth ranged from 0. 21 - 0. 39 mm.
