5|$|At 14:50 CDT, Flight 191 {{pushed back}} from gate K5 and was cleared to taxi to runway 32R. Maintenance crews {{present at the}} gate did not notice {{anything}} unusual during <b>push</b> <b>back,</b> engine start, or taxi. Everything looked normal as the flight began its takeoff roll at 15:03.|$|E
5|$|By 07:40, {{all five}} hijackers were aboard the flight, {{scheduled}} to depart at 07:45. Mohamed Atta sat in business class seat 8D with Abdulaziz al-Omari in 8G and Suqami in 10B. Waleed al-Shehri and Wail al-Shehri sat {{in first class}} seats 2B and 2A. At 07:46, one minute behind schedule, the aircraft received clearance to <b>push</b> <b>back</b> from Gate B32, and was cleared to taxi to the runway at 07:50. The aircraft began its takeoff run from Logan International Airport at 07:59 from runway4R.|$|E
5|$|Even though racial {{politics}} often {{resulted in}} the company receiving untrained replacements, it performed well in many small-scale engagements during this time. In the summer of 1951, the company was employed along the front line as an advance force to <b>push</b> <b>back</b> Chinese attacks as the front lines became more static. The company was highly regarded for its actions capturing and holding Hill 581 during the Battle of the Soyang River, in which the company inflicted hundreds of casualties on the Chinese without a single Ranger being killed.|$|E
50|$|The {{initial release}} was {{scheduled}} in August 2012 but Eurogamer revealed {{the game was}} <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> to October, which was then <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> again to January 2013 on 26 July 2012. The date was further <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> to 12 March 2013.|$|R
50|$|In March 2015, EuropaCorp set {{the film}} for a February 19, 2016 release. On December 15, 2015, the release date was <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> to June 17, 2016. In February 2016, the release date was <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> again to September 9, 2016. In May 2016, the release date was <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> again to November 11, 2016.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} {{initially}} set for release on August 14, 2015, but on May 1, 2014, the reboot film's release date was <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> to August 5, 2016.

5|$|In {{two weeks}} of {{fighting}} {{in and around the}} fortress, the North Koreans were able to gradually <b>push</b> <b>back</b> the UN forces from Ka-san and Hills 755 and 314 to the south, but the UN forces held out strongly and the North Koreans were not able to quickly consolidate their gains. The UN forces defended the ground tenaciously, even assigning a battalion of engineers to fight on the front lines, eventually preventing the North Koreans from advancing long enough for a UN counterattack at Inchon which drove the North Koreans from the area.|$|E
5|$|On 23 December, Lieutenant-General Dempsey's XIII Corps {{launched}} a new attack to <b>push</b> <b>back</b> the German line from Orsogna. In the afternoon, the British 5th Infantry Division attacked on {{the right wing of}} the Corps front toward the Arielli stream. Their objective was to secure the flank of the 2nd New Zealand Division, which was in turn to attack northwest and west from the salient in order to roll up the Orsogna defences from the north.|$|E
5|$|The NK 12th Division was {{operating}} in the valley west of P'ohang-dong {{and was able to}} <b>push</b> <b>back</b> Task Force P'ohang and the ROK Capital Division. At the same time, the NK 766th Infantry Regiment and elements of the NK 5th Division fought Task Force Bradley at and south of P'ohang-dong. U.S. naval fire was able to drive NK troops from the town, but it became a bitterly contested no man's land as fighting moved to the hills around the town.|$|E
50|$|Endwar's {{release date}} was <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> three times {{originally}} {{planned to be}} released in 2007, but was <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> to March 2008 and then to November 4, 2008.|$|R
50|$|The {{album was}} meant to be {{released}} sometime in 2000, was <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> to the fall of 2001, then <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> to the fall of 2003, and was finally released on May 15, 2007.|$|R
50|$|In late November 2006, Marvel {{announced}} another delay. Civil War #6, originally {{scheduled for}} release on December 20, was <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> two weeks and released on January 4. Unlike the previous instance, only The Punisher War Journal #2 was delayed. In a final act of rescheduling, Civil War #7 was <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> two weeks (from January 17 to January 31), and then <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> again until February 21.|$|R
5|$|Andronicus II {{took a deep}} {{interest}} in preserving the Anatolian lands of Byzantium and ordered construction of forts in Asia Minor and vigorous training of the army. The Byzantine Emperor ordered that his court be moved to Anatolia to oversee the campaigns there and instructed his General Alexios Philanthropenos to <b>push</b> <b>back</b> the Turks. Early successes were rendered useless when Alexios staged an unsuccessful coup, leading to his blinding {{and the end of}} his campaigns. This allowed the Ottomans to lay siege to Nicaea in 1301. A further defeat on Andronicus' son Michael IX and the Byzantine general George Mouzalon occurred at Magnesia and Bapheus in 1302.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} {{mechanism for}} the formation of planetesimals is the streaming instability in which the drag felt by particles orbiting through gas creates a feedback effect causing the growth of local concentrations. These local concentration <b>push</b> <b>back</b> on the gas creating a region where the headwind felt by the particles is smaller. The concentration is thus able to orbit faster and undergoes less radial drift. Isolated particles join these concentrations as they are overtaken or as they drift inward causing it to grow in mass. Eventually these concentrations form massive filaments which fragment and undergo gravitational collapse forming planetesimals the size of the larger asteroids.|$|E
5|$|Fossil caddisflies {{have been}} found in rocks dating back to the Triassic. The largest numbers of fossilised remains are those of larval cases, which are made of durable {{materials}} that preserve well. Body fossils of caddisflies are extremely rare, the oldest being from the Early and Middle Triassic, some 230 million years ago, and wings are another source of fossils. The evolution of the group to one with fully aquatic larvae seems to have taken place some time during the Triassic. The finding of fossils resembling caddisfly larval cases in marine deposits in Brazil may <b>push</b> <b>back</b> the origins of the order to the early Permian period.|$|E
50|$|The {{release date}} was shifted several times. It was {{initially}} set for May 29, 2015, but on January 26, 2015, {{the film was}} <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> to December 25, 2015, a date first assigned for Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. On May 5, 2015, the film was <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> again, to March 18, 2016. On November 10, 2015, the film's release date was <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> again, to January 13, 2017.|$|R
50|$|We Are The Ocean {{started writing}} {{material}} for their debut album around December 2008. The album {{was produced by}} Brian McTernan (Thrice, The Bled, Converge) at Salad Days Studio in Baltimore, USA. They were originally aiming for a Summer 2009 release but for unknown reasons the album release date was delayed many times. <b>Pushing</b> <b>back</b> to November, then <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> again to 25 January 2010, and finally <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> to 1 February 2010.|$|R
50|$|The Twin Snakes was {{released}} on March 9, 2004 in North America. It was originally {{to be released in}} November 2003, but was <b>pushed</b> <b>back,</b> along with the other versions. The European date was <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> several weeks.|$|R
5|$|Henry's {{relationship}} with the Church varied considerably across his lands and over time: as with other aspects of his rule, there was no attempt to form a common ecclesiastical policy. Insofar as Henry had a policy it was to generally <b>push</b> <b>back</b> on papal influence, increasing his own local authority. The 12th century saw a reforming movement within the Church, however, advocating greater autonomy from royal authority for the clergy and more influence for the papacy. This trend had already caused tensions in England, for example when King Stephen forced Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, into exile in 1152. There were also long-running concerns over the legal treatment {{of members of the}} clergy.|$|E
5|$|In Iberia, the Christian states, {{which had}} been {{confined}} to the north-western part of the peninsula, began to <b>push</b> <b>back</b> against the Islamic states in the south, a period known as the Reconquista. By about 1150, the Christian north had coalesced into the five major kingdoms of León, Castile, Aragon, Navarre, and Portugal. Southern Iberia remained under control of Islamic states, initially under the Caliphate of Córdoba, which broke up in 1031 into a shifting number of petty states known as taifas, who fought with the Christians until the Almohad Caliphate re-established centralised rule over Southern Iberia in the 1170s. Christian forces advanced again in the early 13th century, culminating in the capture of Seville in 1248.|$|E
5|$|In May, the Croatian {{government}} {{responded by}} forming the Croatian National Guard (Zbor narodne garde - ZNG), but its development was hampered by a United Nations (UN) arms embargo introduced in September. On 8 October, Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia, {{and a month}} later the ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska - HV). Late 1991 saw the fiercest fighting of the war, as the 1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia culminated in the Siege of Dubrovnik, and the Battle of Vukovar. In western Slavonia, the HV managed to <b>push</b> <b>back</b> the JNA at several points, and secure Papuk Mountain in early December in Operation Otkos 10.|$|E
50|$|The {{release date}} for the single was {{originally}} announced as November 9, 2010 before being <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> to December 13. The release date was <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> again to December 26, when it was released as a digital download.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{scheduled}} for release on May 12, 2017, {{it was reported that}} the live-action film adaptation was <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> and was set for a June 29, 2018 release in the United States; it was later <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> to August 8, 2018.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} released on April 29, 2016, but was <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> to February 3, 2017. On December 30, 2016, it was <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> to October 20, 2017, and will be released by Pure Flix Entertainment.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to the UN advances, China's Chairman, Mao Zedong, ordered the People's Liberation Army's North East Frontier Force to enter North Korea and engage UN forces under the name People's Volunteer Army (PVA). In order to stabilize the rapidly collapsing Korean front and to <b>push</b> <b>back</b> the advancing UN forces, Mao authorized the First Phase Campaign, a bridgehead-building operation {{with the aim of}} destroying the ROK II Corps, the vanguard and the right flank of the US Eighth Army, advancing up along the Taebaek Mountains {{in the middle of the}} peninsula. After the Chinese leadership finally settled the issue of armed intervention on October 18, Mao ordered the PVA to enter Korea on October 19 under strict secrecy.|$|E
5|$|The HV {{continued}} to grow, numbering about 200,000 troops {{by the end}} of 1991. Although the force successfully countered the JNA that year, the HV was deficient in organisation, training and heavy-weapons support. By the end of 1991, the HV still lacked sufficient resources to <b>push</b> <b>back</b> the JNA and continued experiencing inadequate work by their staff. Nonetheless, like the ZNG it benefited from its troops' high morale and the well-defined purpose of its mission. The growth and systematic improvement of HV capability accelerated in 1992, continuing throughout the Croatian War of Independence. The anniversary of the ZNG parade at the Kranjčevićeva Street Stadium is celebrated annually in Croatia as Armed Forces Day and Croatian Army Day.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} Dinner was {{announced}} in August 2010, to open in early 2011 to replace the Michelin starred restaurant Foliage at the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park. The opening was originally planned for 1 December, but delays occurred, which {{would have resulted in}} the restaurant being ready to open during Christmas week. The decision was made to <b>push</b> <b>back</b> the opening until after the Christmas period was over. Reservations began to be accepted on 1 December 2010 for the restaurant's opening on 31 January 2011. There were 42 phone lines set up on the opening day of reservations, which received over 600 telephone bookings. Prior to opening, the first three months were solidly booked. A Valentine's day booking was sold on auction site eBay, which went for £250.|$|E
50|$|Wiz Khalifa {{announced}} on April 11, 2012 that the album's release date {{would be on}} August 28. However the album was <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> to September 18, 2012. On September 5, 2012, the album was <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> again with no release date.|$|R
50|$|The {{third round}} was {{scheduled}} to be played on the weekend of 10-11 October, but the match between Gor Mahia and Palos was <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> to 14 October while the match between A.F.C. Leopards and Ulinzi Stars was <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> to 21 October.|$|R
50|$|While {{the movie}} was {{intended}} to be released on April 21, 2017, the release date was <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> to September 1, 2017. However, due to the film not having a definitive distributor as of yet, this release date has been <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> indefinitely.|$|R
5|$|A {{few days}} later the British Second Army {{launched}} Operation Charnwood, to take Caen. This incorporated the postponed attack on Carpiquet, originally planned for Epsom as Operation Ottawa but now codenamed Operation Windsor. In a frontal assault the northern half {{of the city was}} captured, with the remaining portions being taken during Operations Atlantic and Goodwood in the third week of July. Fighting in the Odon Valley continued and on 10 July Operation Jupiter was launched by VIII Corps to <b>push</b> <b>back</b> the German forces near the village of Baron-sur-Odon, retake Hill 112 and advance to the River Orne. The Second Battle of the Odon began on 15 July to divert German attention from the ground where Operation Goodwood was to take place. The second battle has been called one of the bloodiest encounters of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|American forces finally {{halted the}} North Korean advance {{in a series}} of engagements in the {{southern}} section of the country. Forces of the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, newly arrived in the country, were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by North Korean forces on July 27, opening a pass to the Pusan area. Soon after, North Korean forces took Chinju to the west, pushing back the US 19th Infantry Regiment and leaving routes to the Pusan open for more North Korean attacks. US formations were subsequently able to defeat and <b>push</b> <b>back</b> the North Koreans on the flank in the Battle of the Notch on August 2. Suffering mounting losses, the KPA force in the west withdrew for several days to re-equip and receive reinforcements. This granted both sides a reprieve to prepare for the attack on the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the month, the Serb {{rebels and}} the JNA {{controlled}} nearly all of the southern bank of the river, and the lines of control in the region largely stabilised. Before the ceasefire of 3 January 1992, which implemented the Vance plan, the Serb rebels and the JNA made two more unsuccessful attempts to <b>push</b> <b>back</b> the Croatian forces in the region. These attacks comprised the autumn campaign undertaken by the JNA—in the area of Slana and Novi Farkašić on 17–18 October and in the area of Sunja on 2 November. In the same period, the ZNG launched an unsuccessful offensive codenamed Operation Whirlwind to recapture Glina on 11–13 December. The 120 Croats who remained in the area of Dubica faced persecution, culminating in the Baćin massacre of more than 50 Croats on 21 October, and the rounding up and expulsion of the remainder on 20 November.|$|E
50|$|On January 8, 2014, it was {{revealed}} on Bittner's Facebook fan page that {{the name of the}} third Toxik album is In Humanity. A spring 2014 release was expected. However, the album's release date was <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> to 2016, before being <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> to 2017.|$|R
