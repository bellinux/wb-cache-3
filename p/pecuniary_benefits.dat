40|$|We find non <b>pecuniary</b> <b>benefits</b> of {{business}} ownership {{to be an}} important consideration in explaining small business formation. Using a variety of data sources, we show that the overwhelming majority of small businesses do not match the theoretical concept of an entrepreneur. Specifically, nearly all small businesses do not grow, do not want to grow, do not innovate, and do not want to innovate. Second, using new data from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics, we show that a majority of small business owners report that non <b>pecuniary</b> <b>benefits</b> (e. g., being one’s own boss, having flexibility over one’s schedule) were the primary reason that they started their business. Third, we embed non <b>pecuniary</b> <b>benefits</b> into a standard model of occupational choice that abstracts from other traditional channels of risk, ability, and liquidity constraints. This simple model generates predictions consistent with many aspects of the data: we find that the propensity to start a small business is still positively correlated with individual wealth despite the omission of binding capital constraints; small businesses will be concentrated in industries with lower returns to scale; and we show a wage firm-size premium even without assumed differences in productivity among firms or workers. We also show that the existenc...|$|E

The sample was limited to those in paygrades E 4 -E 6, with 5 - 10 years of service, and who had less than one year remaining in their commitment. Psychological, economic, organizational, and personal/demographic characteristics were investigated to determine their effect on the enlistees' career decision. A multivariate logit regression model was estimated utilizing these explanatory variables: Single/Wo/Dep., Single/W/Dep., Married/Wo/Dep., Black, Hispanic, YOS, Technical, Medical, Admin/Supply, Probability of Alternative, and Composite variables for satisfaction with work environment, and satisfaction with <b>pecuniary</b> <b>benefits.</b> The result indicates that there were significant differences in the factors affecting the intended and actual reenlistment decisions.

40|$|We embed {{a simple}} incomplete-contracts model of {{organization}} design {{in a standard}} two-country perfectly-competitive trade model to examine how the liberalization of product and factor markets affects the ownership structure of firms. In our model, managers {{decide whether or not}} to integrate their firms, trading off the <b>pecuniary</b> <b>benefits</b> of coordinating production decisions with the private benefits of operating in their preferred ways. The price of output is a crucial determinant of this choice, since it affects the size of the <b>pecuniary</b> <b>benefits.</b> In particular, non-integration is chosen at "low" and "high" prices, while integration occurs at moderate prices. Organizational choices also depend on the terms of trade in supplier markets, which affect the division of surplus between managers. We obtain three main results. First, even when firms do not relocate across countries, the price changes triggered by liberalization of product markets can lead to significant organizational restructuring within countries. Second, the removal of barriers to factor mobility can lead to inefficient reorganization and adversely affect consumers. Third, "deep integration" - the liberalization of both product and factor markets - leads to the convergence of organizational design across countries. Contracts; Firms; Globalization...|$|E

The <b>pecuniary</b> <b>benefit</b> to consumers of in-kind transfers, relative to cash transfers, equals 11 % of the direct transfer. ...|$|R

However, a myriad of performance measures were used and notably many still consider financial performance as key measures.

40|$|A {{case study}} of UK tax policy from 1979 to 1997 is {{used to examine the}} role of ideas and {{interests}} in the destruction of political rents. Rent destruction has been typically understood as occurring when the battle for distributional advantage that normally characterises democratic politics has been temporarily superseded by policies informed by ideology pursued in the public interest. The benefits that resulted from the destruction of political rents by the Conservative governments of Thatcher and Major could have been distributed broadly across all taxpayers, but instead were targeted at specific groups of taxpayers. It is argued that this is evidence of the continued salience of distributional demands, even when rents are being destroyed. It suggests that political reforms that destroy rents require the support of a political coalition and the mobilisation of that coalition may require the promise of direct <b>pecuniary</b> <b>benefits</b> from the new arrangements...|$|E
