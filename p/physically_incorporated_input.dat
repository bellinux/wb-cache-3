40|$|Two methods (cholate {{dialysis}} and cholate gel filtration) used {{to incorporate}} cytochromes P 450 (P 450 s) and reductase into unila-mellar phospholipid vesicles {{were compared with}} a standard re-constituted system (SRS) in which the proteins were reconstituted with preformed liposomes. Both cholate dialysis and gel filtration methods were comparable {{in their ability to}} <b>physically</b> <b>incorporate</b> reductase and either CYP 2 B 4 or CYP 1 A 2 into phospholipid, as determined by the elution of enzymes in the void volume using size exclusion chromatography (mol. wt. cutoff 5, 000, 000). Incorpora-tion of these proteins was more efficient with both cholate meth-ods than when reductase and P 450 were mixed with preformed vesicles (SRS). Using either cholate method, more than 85 % of the P 450 was <b>physically</b> <b>incorporated</b> into the phospholipid vesicles, whereas less than 40 % of the P 450 was <b>physically</b> <b>incorporated</b> into the phospholipid vesicles using the SRS.

40|$|The {{combined}} use {{of natural}} ECM components and synthetic materials offers an attractive alternative to fabricate hydrogel-based tissue engineering scaffolds to study cell-matrix interactions in three-dimensions (3 D). A facile method was developed to modify gelatin with cysteine via a bifunctional PEG linker, thus introducing free thiol groups to gelatin chains. A covalently crosslinked gelatin hydrogel was fabricated using thiolated gelatin and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGdA) via thiol-ene reaction. Unmodified gelatin was <b>physically</b> <b>incorporated</b> in a PEGdA-only matrix for comparison. We sought to understand the effect of crosslinking modality on hydrogel physicochemical properties and the impact on 3 D cell entrapment. Compared to <b>physically</b> <b>incorporated</b> gelatin hydrogels, covalently crosslinked gelatin hydrogels displayed higher maximum weight swelling ratio (Q max), higher water content, significantly lower cumulative gelatin dissolution up to 7 days, and lower gel stiffness. Furthermore, fibroblasts encapsulated within covalently crosslinked gelatin hydrogels showed extensive cytoplasmic spreading {{and the formation of}} cellular networks over 28 days. In contrast, fibroblasts encapsulated in the <b>physically</b> <b>incorporated</b> gelatin hydrogels remained spheroidal. Hence, crosslinking ECM protein with synthetic matrix creates a stable scaffold with tunable mechanical properties and with long-term cell anchorage points, thus supporting cell attachment and growth in the 3 D environment. © 2011.
