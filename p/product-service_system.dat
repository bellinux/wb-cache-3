The service economy in developing countries is mostly concentrated in financial services, hospitality, retail, health, human services, information technology and education.

5000|$|In the {{traditional}} <b>product-service</b> <b>system</b> (PSS) business model, industries develop product with value-added service instead of single product itself, and provide their customers {{services that are}} needed. In this relationship, the market goal of manufacturers is not one-time product selling, but continuous profit from customers by total service solution, which can satisfy unmet customers’ needs. Most of PSS systems focus on ‘human-generated or human-related data’ instead of ‘machine-generated data or industrial data’, which may include machine controllers, sensors, manufacturing systems, etc. Early work using web-based product monitoring for remote product services including GM OnStar Telematics, Otis Remote Elevator Maintenance (REM), and GE Medical InSite during 1990s.

The eco-costs of global warming are required to reveal the difference between fossil-based products and bio-based products, since biogenic CO2 is not counted in LCA (biogenic CO2 is part of the natural recycle loop in the biosphere).Therefore, total eco-costs can be regarded as a robust indicator for cradle-to-cradle calculations in LCA for products and services in the theory of the circular economy.Since the economic viability of a business model is also an important aspect of the circular economy, the added value of a <b>product-service</b> <b>system</b> {{should be part of the}} analysis.

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the main}} {{interest}} of <b>product-service</b> <b>system</b> (PSS) is its potentiality to minimize {{the environmental impact of}} both consumption and production. In the energy sector, <b>Product-Service</b> <b>System</b> has been discussed in the literature as a concept associated with energy efficiency. However, the liberalization of the energy markets and the increasing market share of distributed renewable energy allow ventures and new actors to employ <b>Product-Service</b> <b>System</b> in both decentralized renewable energy generation and demand-side management. This paper is a review paper exploring different business models (BMs) for energy transition. It outlines three major business models: Customer-owned product centered BMs, where the customer owns the product related to the electricity generation or management; Third-party service centered BMs, where a third party offers energy services to the customer; and finally Energy community BMs, where resources are pooled and shared between community members...|$|E
40|$|Many {{companies}} are seeking ways of integrating {{products and services}} in their offerings to become more competitive. This is a transition towards a <b>Product-Service</b> <b>System,</b> where the product no longer necessarily becomes the only central part. This thesis aims to study how a company can design its Business Model to exploit the potential of a <b>Product-Service</b> <b>System.</b> This purpose has been answered through an understanding of theories {{in the field of}} Product-Service Systems and Business Models. The data collection was done through two case studies involving qualitative semi-structured interviews with business professionals with insights in a company’s Business Model and a <b>Product-Service</b> <b>System.</b> The main case company for this thesis is BAE Systems Hägglunds, while BAE Systems Global Combat Systems and Koneo were investigated in order find further empirical evidence in relation to the thesis purpose. In order to facilitate the empirical research, a framework for data collection and analysis was developed. Previous research within the field constituted the base and it was therefore used in a deductive approach to facilitate data collection and analysis. The most important findings in this study is that the Business Model needs to handle a more comprehensive value offering since companies tend to add additional value, while taking over customers activities when adopting a <b>Product-Service</b> <b>System.</b> This demands closer collaboration with customers and PSS providers, and the Business Model will have to focus on relationships in a wider extent. The ability to be profitable is a main concern and companies need to consider costs throughout the entire lifecycle, focus on proactive management, as well as considering risk-transfer in order to decrease the risks incorporated in the value proposition. This thesis determines that the change to a <b>Product-Service</b> <b>System</b> will have large organizational implications and thus affect many factors in a company’s Business Model.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project is to develop an innovative framework to implement lean principles in <b>Product-Service</b> <b>System</b> (PSS) with the capability of assessing the leanness level of the services offering process. The framework comprises three implementation phases namely: assessment of the current state, developing a future state, and stabilising the new way of operations. Additionally, the framework covers the enablers, factors, and appropriate lean tools required for the successful implementation of lean practices in <b>Product-Service</b> <b>System</b> (PSS), as well as, the challenges that may obstacle the implementation process. The proposed framework has integrated an assessment model that provides a quantifiable measure of the leanness level of <b>Product-Service</b> <b>System</b> (PSS). Five main enablers and thirty three factors emerging from these main enablers deemed to be critical for the successful implementation of lean practices in <b>Product-Service</b> <b>System</b> (PSS). Moreover, a series of eight inhibitors appeared to block the implementation process. The <b>Product-Service</b> <b>System</b> leanness assessment model was developed upon three main levels, namely: enablers, criteria, and attributes. The first level contains five enablers. These enablers are supplier relationship, management leanness, workforce leanness, process excellence, and customer relationship. In the second level there are twenty one criteria such as: supplier delivery, culture of management and process optimisation. Finally, the third level consists of seventy three attributes. By using multi-grade fuzzy approach the PSS leanness index was computed and areas for further improvement were identified. A combination of research methodology approaches has been employed in {{this research}}. Firstly, an extensive literature review related to lean and PSS was conducted. Secondly, the qualitative approach and the case study were selected as an appropriate methodology for this research, using semi-structured and structured interview techniques to gather the required data from experts {{who are involved in}} lean projects in their companies. Finally, validation of the results was carried out using real life industrial case studies and experts judgment. Case studies demonstrate that the framework provides guidelines for manufacturing companies that aim to implement lean principles in <b>Product-Service</b> <b>System</b> (PSS). The framework enables manufacturing companies to better satisfy their customers’ needs through responding quickly to their changing demands; to improve the service offering process through reducing the creation of wastes and non-value added activities; and to improve competitiveness through increasing customers’ value. Additionally, the PSS leanness index is useful for improving the service offering process. The index provides manufacturing companies with a real insight into the leanness level of their service offering, as well as, it provides managers with a quantifiable measure of how lean their PSS is. The index identifies the gap between the current state and the future state and this helps in determining areas for further improvement...|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, {{many firms}} had {{to focus on}} the price of their products, as there was a {{constant}} threat that companies from low-cost labor countries would steal their work if not. Thus, there was a realization that services needed to be integrated with the products to enhance the value and become more competitive, which became known as a <b>Product-Service</b> <b>System.</b> This means that the customer finds value {{in the use of the}} product, rather than in the product itself. In this thesis, the purpose is to find out how a company can improve their value proposition by implementing a <b>Product-Service</b> <b>System,</b> but also what benefits they will receive from that, and what barriers are needed to overcome. Gaining an understanding for the value proposition within the business model, and also the <b>Product-Service</b> <b>System,</b> helped facilitate the execution of this thesis. By studying theoretical information, along with conducting two case studies at a case company and a benchmarked company, data could be collected. The benchmarked company is <b>Product-Service</b> <b>System</b> oriented, and hence it added empirical evidence to the theoretical information. The theoretical information was gathered through books and articles, and therefore a deductive approach was used for that. Findings in this thesis are that in order to improve the value proposition, but also gain and retain customers, a company needs to focus greatly on integrating services with products. This means offering more comprehensive product/service solutions, by getting to know the customers and find out how to satisfy their needs. This requires a closer relationship between the two parties, and is more time consuming. The organizational structure and culture will also need to change in order to accommodate the new offerings and way of doing business, along with coming up with a new pricing strategy since more value-added services are included with the products. This will, potentially, result in enhanced value for the customers, and the company can gain a sustainable competitive advantage. Validerat; 20130609 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E
