5000|$|Psychological models offer {{additional}} {{insights into}} social dilemmas by questioning the game theory assumption that individuals {{are confined to}} their narrow self-interest. Interdependence Theory suggests that people transform a given <b>pay-off</b> <b>matrix</b> into an effective matrix that is more consistent with their social dilemma preferences. A prisoner’s dilemma with close kin, for example, changes the <b>pay-off</b> <b>matrix</b> into one {{in which it is}} rational to be cooperative. Attribution models offer further support for these transformations. Whether individuals approach a social dilemma selfishly or cooperatively might depend upon whether they believe people are naturally greedy or cooperative. Similarly, goal-expectation theory assumes that people might cooperate under two conditions: They must (1) have a cooperative goal, and (2) expect others to cooperate. Another psychological model, the appropriateness model, questions the game theory assumption that individuals rationally calculate their pay-offs. Instead many people base their decisions on what people around them do and use simple heuristics, like an equality rule, {{to decide whether or not}} to cooperate. The logic of appropriateness suggests that people ask themselves the question: [...] "what does a person like me (identity) do (rules/heuristics) in a situation like this (recognition) given this culture (group)?" [...] (Weber et al., 2004) (Kopelman 2009) and that these factors influence cooperation.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. - Advances in multiagent {{simulation}} techniques make {{it possible}} to study more realistic dynamics of complex systems and allow evolutionary theories to be tested. Here I use simulations to asses the relative importance of reproductive systems (haplodiploidy vs. diploidy), mate selection (assortative mating vs. random mating) and social economics (<b>pay-off</b> <b>matrices</b> of evolutionary games) in the evolutionary dynamics leading to the emergence of social cooperation in the provision of parental care. The simulations confirm that haplo-diploid organisms and organisms mating assortatively have a higher probability for fixing alleles and require less favorable conditions for their fixation, than diploids or organisms mating randomly. The simulations showed that social behavior was most likely to emerge a) when the cost for parental investment was much lower than the benefits to the offspring, b) when cooperation improved synergistically the fitness of offspring compared to the corresponding egoistic behavior and c) when alleles coding for altruistic or social behavior could be rapidly fixed in the population, thanks to mechanisms such as haplo-diploidy and/or assortative mating. Cooperative social behavior always appeared if sociality conferred much higher fitness gains compared to non cooperative alternatives suggesting that the most important factors for th...|$|R
40|$|This paper advocates {{the concept}} of user {{modeling}} (UM), which involves dialogue strategies. We focus on human-machine collaboration, which is endowed with human-like capabilities and in this regard, UM {{could be related to}} cognitive modeling, which deals with issues of perception, behavioral decision and selective attention by humans. In our UM, approximating a <b>pay-off</b> <b>matrix</b> or function will be the method employed in order to estimate user’s pay-offs, which is basically calculated by user’s action. Our proposed computation method allows dialogue strategies to be determined by maximizing mutual expectations of the <b>pay-off</b> <b>matrix.</b> We validated the proposed computation using a social game called “Iterative Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD) ” that is usually used for modeling social relationships based on reciprocal altruism. Furthermore, we also allowed the <b>pay-off</b> <b>matrix</b> to be used with a probability distribution function. That is, we assumed that a person’s pay-off could fluctuate over time, but that the fluctuation could be utilized in order to avoid dead reckoning in a true <b>pay-off</b> <b>matrix.</b> Accordingly, the computational structure is reminiscent of the regularization implicated by the machine learning theory. In a way, we are convinced that the crucial role of dialogue strategies is to enable user models to be smoother by approximating probabilistic pay-off functions. That is, their user models can be more accurate or more precise since the dialogue strategies induce the on-line maintenance of models. Consequently, our improved computation allowing the <b>pay-off</b> <b>matrix</b> to be treated as a probabilistic density function has led to better performance, Because the probabilistic pay-off function can be shifted in order to minimize error between approximated and true pay-offs in others. Moreover, our results suggest that in principle the proposed dialogue strategy should be implemented to achieve maximum mutual expectation and uncertainty reduction regarding pay-offs for others. Our work also involves analogous correspondences on the study of pattern regression and user modeling in accordance with machine learning theory...|$|E

Moreover, many of the parameters used in the models are quite abstract and difficult to adapt to actual organisms. By introducing four measurable parameters, the cost of aggression, relatedness, mutual helping and one-sided helping effects into the basic hawk-dove game and limiting the situation to a non-repeated (non-learning) game, we could showed a mixed ESS of aggression {{and cooperation}}, which must appear continuous variation of aggressiveness with relat-edness in nature.

40|$|A central {{question}} in the mathematical study of evolution is to obtain the fixation probability as function of the initial condition, once we are given a stochastic finite population model without mutations and a (possibly frequency dependent) fitness function. Despite {{the fact that the}} fixation probability is an important macroscopic property of the population, its precise knowledge does not give any useful information about the interaction patterns among individuals in the population. Here we work in the inverse problem: From a given fixation pattern, we obtain a discrete fitness function, which realises this fixation pattern in the Wright-Fisher model. This discrete fitness function always exists, but it is not necessary unique. Subsequently, we show that any such discrete fitness function can be approximated, with arbitrary precision, using $d$-player game theory, provided $d$ is large enough. The <b>pay-off</b> <b>matrix</b> that emerges naturally from the approximating game will provide useful information about the individual interaction structure that is not itself apparent in the fixation pattern.

40|$|Recent game {{experiments}} {{have revealed that}} individual variation in behaviour across strategically distinct situations is correlated, and that these behavioural patterns are linked to personality traits [13] [4]. Classic experiments demonstrate that behaviour in games is determined as much by the framing of the game as by the strategic fundamentals of the game, that is the underlying <b>pay-off</b> <b>matrix</b> [2]. Framing effects are not restricted to the explicit framing of the experimenter but also include the implicit cultural framing of the participant[8]. There is also strong experimental evidence that the typical human response to a novel decision is not a strategic analysis of the situation. Instead the novel decision is linked by analogy to a different decision familiar to the decision maker[6]. The cultural context, personality traits, and personal history of the decision maker prescribe a behaviour for the familiar situation, which the decision maker then matches to the closest available behaviour in the novel situation. Taken together these facts suggest that considering the evolutionary stable strategy of any one particular game will aid the understanding of human behaviour in frequently experienced and easily recognizable situations, but will be o...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between fairness and efficiency {{is a central}} issue for policy makers. To date {{there is no agreement}} among economists whether a public policy that pursues fairness entails a loss of efficiency of an economic system, or an oriented towards efficiency policy is able to facilitate the achievement of a higher fairness. In this paper we present the fairness/efficiency issue through the analysis of four agent-based simulations that implement the El Farol Bar Model proposed by Brian Arthur in (1994). As El Farol Bar models are not interested in exploring the equity issue, we modified them by introducing a set of measures of efficiency and fairness. Particularly, we assume that fairness is a short run issue and we develop time-based measurements of fairness. The computational analysis shows that selfish agents are able to achieve an efficient use of available resources, but they are incapable of generating a fair use of them. The analysis shows that random choices of agents generate an apparent fairness, which occurs only in the long run. Thus, a suitable {{relationship between}} efficiency and fairness could be reached by a public policy which defines an appropriate <b>pay-off</b> <b>matrix</b> able to drive agents' choices...|$|E

Under the prisoner's dilemma <b>pay-off</b> <b>matrix,</b> the birds generally defected (i. e., pecked the color associated with not cooperating) against both a random response (. 5 probability of either alternative) and a tit-for-tat strategy (on trial n the computer “chooses” the alternative {{that is the}} same as the one chosen by the subject on trial n – 1) played by the computer. They consistently defected in the tit-for-tat condition despite the fact that as a consequence they earned about one third of the food that they could have if they had cooperated (i. e., pecked the “cooperate” color) on all the trials. Manipulation of the values of the food pay-offs demonstrated that the defection and consequent loss of food under the tit-for-tat condition were not due to a lack of sensitivity to differences in pay-off values, nor to strict avoidance of a null pay-off (no food on a trial), nor to insensitivity to the local (current trial) reward contingencies. Rather, the birds markedly discounted future outcomes and thus made their response choices based on immediate outcomes available on the present trial rather than on long-term delayed outcomes over many trials. That is, the birds were impulsive, choosing smaller but more immediate rewards, and did not demonstrate self-control. Implications for the study of cooperation and competition in both humans and nonhumans are discussed...|$|E
