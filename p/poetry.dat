5|$|And Still I Rise {{is author}} Maya Angelou's third volume of <b>poetry,</b> {{published}} by Random House in 1978. It was published {{during one of}} the most productive periods in Angelou's career; she had written three autobiographies and published two other volumes of <b>poetry</b> up to that point. Angelou considered herself a poet and a playwright, but was best known for her seven autobiographies, especially her first, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, although her <b>poetry</b> has also been successful.

5|$|Classical thinkers {{employed}} classification {{as a way}} {{to define}} and assess the quality of <b>poetry.</b> Notably, the existing fragments of Aristotle's Poetics describe three genres of poetry—the epic, the comic, and the tragic—and develop rules to distinguish the highest-quality <b>poetry</b> in each genre, based on the underlying purposes of the genre. Later aestheticians identified three major genres: epic <b>poetry,</b> lyric <b>poetry,</b> and dramatic <b>poetry,</b> treating comedy and tragedy as subgenres of dramatic <b>poetry.</b>|$|E

5|$|As the {{tradition}} of classical Gaelic <b>poetry</b> declined, a new tradition of vernacular Gaelic <b>poetry</b> began to emerge. While Classical <b>poetry</b> used a language largely fixed in the twelfth century, the vernacular continued to develop. In contrast to the Classical tradition, which used syllabic metre, vernacular poets tended to use stressed metre. However, they shared with the Classic poets a set of complex metaphors and role, as the verse was still often panegyric. A number of these vernacular poets were women, such as Mary MacLeod of Harris (c. 1615–1707).|$|E
5|$|At {{one point}} in the poem, Eliot used terza rima rhyme {{in a manner similar to}} Dante.

Besides Dante, many of the images used in Little Gidding were allusions to Eliot's earlier poems, especially the other poems of the Four Quartets.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{aesthetic}} {{involved with the}} <b>poetry</b> goes much farther {{back in time and}} is used much more subtly than these examples suggest. Beyond issues of adaptation of text to film, Kiarostami often begins with an insistent will to give visual embodiment to certain specific image-making techniques in Persian <b>poetry,</b> both classical and contemporary, and often ends up enunciating a larger philosophical position, namely the ontological oneness of <b>poetry</b> and film.|$|E
