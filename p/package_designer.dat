40|$|The {{majority}} of mechanical damage to packages or products in shipment can be ascribed to {{shocks and vibrations}} experienced during transportation. Vibrations can cause resonance, which {{has the potential to}} damage the product or cause the failure of critical elements within due to the repetitive application of stresses. The response behaviour of cushioning or protective packaging materials under vibration excitation is central to the effective design of product packaging. The response characteristics of the cushioning material guide the design parameters of the product-transport cushion system. Conventionally, this is achieved by the measurement of the transmissibility or Frequency Response Function (FRF) of the product/cushion system by a Single Input-Single Output (SISO) approach assuming a linear relationship. However, the product/cushion system can exhibit strong nonlinear behaviour. The Reverse Multiple Input-Single Output (R-MISO) approach has shown a greater ability to more accurately characterise the nonlinear package/cushion system. This greater accuracy will allow for the use of fewer materials with the benefit of cost and environmental savings. The R-MISO approach revealed {{a significant difference in the}} natural frequency estimate between the SISO linear assumption and the linear frequency response function estimate of the R-MISO approach. A considerable difference in the magnitude of the transmissibility at the estimated natural frequency was also shown. These differences were accompanied by an improvement in coherence. This work adds to the knowledge of the <b>package</b> <b>designer</b> through the study of the significance of the nonlinear behavior of a common cushioning material using the R-MISO method. This new approach to the vibration analysis of cushioning materials will allow the <b>package</b> <b>designer</b> to assess the nonlinear behavior of a packaging material...|$|E

40|$|Littering is {{a social}} and {{environmental}} problem. Numerous studies have been performed trying to understand littering behavior and {{to find ways to}} influence it successfully. Various litter-reduction strategies have been applied with changing success. These have either focused on directly influencing the attitudes of the litterer or on manipulating the environment in which the littering behavior takes place. So far, the influence of the littered object has been largely neglected. This paper proposes that the characteristics of an object are relevant for its chances of being littered, and that this chance can be influenced through design. This is particularly true for packaging. Based on factors identified in literature as relevant to littering behavior, guidelines have been developed for packaging design. As literature shows, litter is not caused by a single type of behavior. Each type of littering behavior requires its own design strategies to reduce it, therefore a tool has been developed to assist the <b>package</b> <b>designer</b> in selecting those guidelines most relevant to his or her current design problem. This tool has been developed and evaluated with people that work in the field of packaging.

The tool will be the basis for further research in the future into the relation between packaging design and littering behavior. Industrial Design Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission {{certifies}} {{several types}} of radioactive waste packages and verifies that the package designers have shown {{that there will be}} no significant chemical, galvanic, or other reactions among the package components and contents, in accordance with Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) 71. 43 (d). For a transportation package containing substances that could generate hydrogen gas, the <b>package</b> <b>designer</b> should calculate the gas generation rate and ensure that it is limited to a molar quantity of no more than 5 percent by volume in the package over a 60 -day shipping period under standard temperature and pressure conditions. In addition, the maximum normal operating pressure (MNOP) of the containment vessel should be designed below the design pressure. Therefore, the MNOP calculations should include the hydrogen gas generated in the payload and released into the inner cavity. Package designers have used various approaches to estimate hydrogen gas generation and demonstrate compliance with the regulatory limits. Because it may be difficult to directly measure the hydrogen gas concentrations during transportation operations, it is important that designers use consistent and reliable methods to evaluate hydrogen gas generation. This paper presents a generic evaluation approach for estimating hydrogen generation from radiolysis and thermal decomposition in generic transportation packages. It also presents the calculation of associated MNOP induced by the potential combined effects of radiolysis, thermal decomposition, thermal expansion, and water vapor. In addition, this paper discusses a generic inerting process commonly used to control combustible gases during the normal conditions of transport. A fictitious data set is used to illustrate the evaluation approach.
