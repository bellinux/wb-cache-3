Although it has been referred to as a product recall by the media, it was not an official government-issued recall by an organization such as the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), and only a voluntary measure. The CPSC did issue an official recall notice on 15 September 2016, and states that Samsung has received at least 92 reports of the batteries overheating in the U.S., including 26 reports of burns and 55 reports of property damage.|$|E

40|$|Background: Preconception carrier {{screening}} for hemoglobinopathies (HbPs) is debated in the Netherlands. Objectives: Intentions to <b>participate</b> in preconception <b>carrier</b> {{screening for}} HbPs {{as well as}} informed reproductive options were assessed in 109 Turkish female immigrants. Method: Participants completed a structured questionnaire. Results: 83. 5 % of 109 Turkish female immigrants intended to <b>participate</b> in preconception <b>carrier</b> screening. Intention to participate {{was related to the}} desire to reduce uncertainty about having offspring affected by HbPs, but not with socio-demographic variables, risk-estimation and worrying. If the tests concerning carrier status for HbPs were confirmative for both partners, 36. 3 % (n = 33) of the women with the intention of preconception carrier screening would refrain from getting children of their own, including 14. 3 % (n = 13) opting for adoption, 37. 4 % (n = 34) would decide to become pregnant and to opt for prenatal testing on HbPs. Finally, among 37. 4 % of the women opting for prenatal testing, 30. 3 % (n = 10) would terminate an affected pregnancy, 18. 2 % (n = 6) not and 51. 5 % (n = 17) could not decide (1 missing value).

40|$|Colloque avec actes et comité de lecture. internationale. International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} {{centralized}} procurement auction {{in which a}} set of shippers collaborate by participating {{together in the same}} combinatorial auction. We address the problem of determining winning carriers (known as the Winner Determination Problem) based not only on bid prices but also on carriers service quality performances. The carrier reputation is translated to an unexpected hidden cost that represents the possible additional cost that the shippers may incur if some problems occur. The objective {{of this study is to}} decide on the winning bids knowing that: (1) a same bid may include shipping contracts requested by dierent shippers and (2) a carrier reputation may dier from one shipper to another. Dierent approaches are proposed to determine hidden costs. These approaches dier on the importance given to the shippers in evaluating the carriers and their bids. Preliminary results show that such a centralized reputation-based transportation auction is benecial on two levels. First, it exploits the synergy between the shipping contracts yielding possibly to lower bid prices. Second, it enables an information sharing between shippers on the service quality performances of the <b>participating</b> <b>carriers</b> to help them have a more accurate judgement on carriers' reputation...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{studies the}} {{shipping}} contract {{and the process}} of execution aiming at enhancing shipper-carrier cooperation and communication in the shipping process. Free cancellation of shipment booking causes conflict in interests of carrier and shipper and prevents optimization techniques from being used. Therefore, a new contract form with a discount term is proposed to benefit both shipper and carrier. The discounted freight rate is offered only for early confirmed booking which requires zero cancellation. The discount allows the shipper to reduce shipping cost and get a higher service level, while the use of confirmed booking helps carrier to stabilize demand and enables better revenue management and operation planning. Two stochastic models are developed to study shipper’s behavior with single carrier. The first model minimizes shippers shipping cost with the optimal confirmed booking volume being calculated from the distribution of show-up volume. An algorithm is developed to find the distribution, followed by the proof of strongly consistence. The second model adds the consideration of service level. We prove that the booking decision and shipment assignment are independent and thus solvable like Model 1. Numerical results demonstrate the impacts of demand characteristics on shipper’s booking behavior, showing that the optimal volume of confirmed booking reveals shipment show-up probability. For the carrier, a small discount can be enough to encourage the shipper to use confirmed booking. In the multiple-carrier problem, a new booking and assignment policy is designed for the shipper to make decisions when some carriers offer discounts for confirmed booking and other carriers do not. The proposed policy is proved to be feasible and satisfying the MQC requirement, while enabling the shipper to make the best use of the discount. The new policy shifts the no-show risk of demand from <b>participating</b> <b>carriers</b> to non-participating carriers. This forms a strategic game for the carriers and pushes them to participate in the new contract, so that in the unique Nash Equilibrium, the shipper as the creator of the game can minimize its total cost as all <b>carriers</b> <b>participate...</b>|$|R
