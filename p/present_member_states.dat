This paper investigates how and to what extent the impact of monetary policy depends on national features of financial systems. The main interest is in examining whether the bank lending channel of monetary policy results in asymmetric loan supply reactions on the aggregate level across countries. The variety of transmission mechanisms suggests that the potency of monetary policy may depend on several country-specific factors. On the basis of descriptive analysis, the <b>present</b> <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> seem to differ considerably in terms of their financial systems. The econometric analysis using aggregate data on a panel of twelve countries supports the view that some of these differences may lead to cross-country asymmetries in responses to the common monetary policy.

This paper analyses the impact of migration on factor income and employment on basis of a computable general equilibrium model. The analysis is undertaken with a dynamic multi-regional CGE model of Germany {{and the rest of}} EU 15. This model, called LEAN (Welsch, 1996), allows to represent labour markets with various degrees of wage rigidities in an open-economy framework. The focus is placed on different scenarios with regard to the scale of migration and the qualification of migrants. Simulation results are evaluated with respect to economic growth, employment, factor income, and the implicit distributive effects. The results show that even substantial levels of migration need not overstrain the adaptive capacity of the German labour market. A change {{of the structure of the}} qualification of migrants may pose more of a challenge. A higher share of highly qualified migrants could strain this relatively small labour market segment. A higher share of low-skilled workers could cause higher unemployment because this labour market segment is more rigid and additionally reduce the average productivity and GDP...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{there will be}} made an attempt for a {{comparative}} political and economic evaluation of the European Monetary Union with the criterionof regional inequalities of the European Union. The national and the regional inequalities of the European Union will be analyzed under {{the framework of the}} policies of the European Monetary Union. Initially we will examine the regional dimension of the european unification {{on the basis of the}} European Union with 15 member-states(EU 15). As criteria we select the different levels of economic development of the member-states examining the regional inequalities on a national level. On this basis we observ that the member states converge creating the "hard core of Europe" and the member states diverge from the average level of the development of the European Union determining the countries of "community cohesion". Next we apply the previous criteria to the EU 27, in other words it is useful to research the inequalities of the levels of economic development, which result in the European Union, if all the other candidate countries would be able to be taken within the EU of 15 as is today. In the EU of 27 with the basis of per capita GNP exist three groups of countries instead of two as exist today. The first group consists of the <b>present</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> of the E 15,except for Spain,Greece and Portugal of which the GNP per capita exceeds by 20 % the new weighted average of the EU 27. the second group consists of the <b>present</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> of community cohesion,i. e. Spain greece and Portugal plus Cyprus,Czechia,and Malta with per capita GNP between 68 %(Czechia) and 95 %(Spain) of the averege of the EU 27. The third group consists of the remaining eight candidate countries with GNP per capita below 40 % of the average of the EU 27,with the exemption of Slovakia and Hungaria of which the GNP per capita lies between 56 %- 58 % of the average of the EU 27. Therefore,the expected expansion with the complex inequalities will result in a big challenge for the European regional policy, and the policy of the economic and social cohesion. First,the expansion will more than double the population of the European Union that lives in regions with GNP per capita below of the 75 %of the present average of the EU. This number will raise from 71 million at the present to 174 million of people or different stated from 19 % of the total of 15 to 36 % of the total of EU 27. Second the scale and the size of regional inequalities will be increased. Therefore in 1998 for the less development regions of the EU 15 the per capita GNP was on average 65 %of the average of the EU 15. With the expansion the GNP per capita of the less development regions of the candidate countries was on the 37 % of the average of EU 15. Therefore, the co-existence of the poor and rich regions within the eu 27 will make the regional inequalities more complex in this part of the Union which consists of poor countries. We make possibly find ourselves in a new allocation of poverty. Finally,we will attempt to achieve the necessary interventions between the EU 15 and the EU 27, researching the modern problems of the EU under the expected expansion of the European Union. ...|$|E

The number of applicant countries and the differences between them are greater than ever before, and they will all be net recipients of the common budget. European solidarity will become {{more important than ever}} in achieving the major goal of reducing disparities in levels of development explicitly set by Article 130 a. The new members would like to get access to the Structural Funds as a major instrument in supporting their modernisation process. Although future resource transfer is not the only reason for becoming a full member of the EU, this field plays a very important role for the Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs). There is no doubt that it is of utmost importance for the historically undercapitalised candidate countries to accelerate their modernisation process, among others, also by having access to EU funds. This paper will focus on the preparation of the European Union for Eastern enlargement in a budgetary sense. It will deal with the role of regional development subsidies within the Union and look through the gradual development of the common regional policy and its reforms. It will provide a critical survey of the Agenda 2000 and discuss decisions of the Berlin European Council on the future of structural funds, with special regard to the financing of enlargement...|$|E

On this basis we obsserve that the member states converge creating the "hard core of Europe" and the member states diverge from the average level of the development of the European Union so that determining the countries of "community cohesion". Next we apply the previous criteria to the EU 27,in other words it is useful to research the inequalities of the levels of economic development,which rrresult in the European Union,if all the others candidate countries would be able to be taken within the EI of 15 as is today.

40|$|From the introduction]. European {{integration}} {{does not}} stop to fascinate political scientists. Many of us are excited about this institution that transcends national interests, overcomes collective action problems, and <b>presents</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> with such a durable and authoritative framework that they slowly but unrecognizably loose authority to model their own policies as desired. But does it? Despite our excitement, {{many of us have}} troubles escaping the reflexes caused by the years of international relations hegemony in studying the EU. Does the EU really have the clout to force <b>member</b> <b>states</b> to adopt unwanted policies? Then how about the never-ending stories about non-compliance, the European Commission’s hesitance in adopting a tough stance on reluctant <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> the difficulties of monitoring actual application and enforcement on the ground? The tension between <b>member</b> <b>state</b> dominance and supranational control continues to offer a well of fascinating research topics. In order to demonstrate the success of the EU in transcending member states’ institutions and policies, or even the domestic interests underlying them, we are advised to answer at least three questions. First, we should answer the question {{of the extent to which}} Europe matters for the <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> Because even if we can identify compliance by initially reluctant <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> this may not be very meaningful if the EU’s share in national matters is only minimal. Even though interesting from a theoretical viewpoint, the societal relevance of massive research attempts to explain the fate of EU intervention in <b>member</b> <b>states</b> is slight when it affects only a minimal terrain of national policy making. Second, we should try to answer the question to what extent any processes of Europeanization we observe are truly affecting the core of what <b>member</b> <b>states</b> are doing or are just added on to existing structures and policies. That is, if we believe that the EU really is capable of overriding <b>member</b> <b>state</b> concerns, the adaptations made by <b>member</b> <b>states</b> should be far from ‘easy’. The adoption of coordination structures, for instance, is an interesting phenomenon, but it does not constitute evidence of the EU’s transformative effect as coordination structures may simply be added on to existing organizational arrangements and can perfectly well co-exist with domestic institutions that were already out there. Finally, we should answer the question of how the European Union impacts on <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> Under what conditions does the EU succeed in bringing about domestic change, and when do <b>member</b> <b>states</b> carry on their business as usual...|$|R
