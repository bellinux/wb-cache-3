5|$|Once {{freed from}} running the better <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> businesses, and financially independent, Muller went to Germany to study {{geography}} and ethnography. He attended lectures at the universities of Heidelberg and Leipzig before completing his doctorate at the University of Giessen in 1894, summa cum laude. His thesis Land und Leute zwischen Zambezi und Limpopo (Land and People between Zambezi and Limpopo) was mainly based on secondary material, {{rather than the}} materials collected and observations made by Muller himself during his time in East Africa. This limited the originality of the study, although in its time it was appreciated as an important piece of academic work, and was also published in a commercial version.|$|E

Both changed hands several times before the American Civil War. In 1868, Dell's Bluff's then owner, Miles Price, sold off {{the southern part of}} the plantation to Florida Union editor Edward M. Cheney and Boston developer John Murray Forbes, who platted the original Riverside development. The northern part Price developed himself as Jacksonville's Brooklyn neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{settlers in}} the Worlds End area rode on two horse trails to traverse the rugged mountains between Muncy Creek and the confluence of Little Loyalsock Creek with Loyalsock Creek at Forksville.

Part of these old horse trails are still in use and known as Pioneer Road and Double Run Road, and form <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> of the seven hiking trails in the park. Worlds End trail and Pioneer Road meet at the Worlds End Vista, which {{is thought to be}} a possible inspiration for the park's name.|$|E

5|$|The Beatles are {{the only}} act to have four Christmas number ones, three {{consecutively}} starting from 1963.

5|$|The {{corridor}} {{through which}} MT 287 passes was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> migration routes along which settlers rushed {{to attempt to}} make their fortunes during the Alder Gulch gold rush that started in 1863. Virginia City {{was the target of}} both routes; the new town became the second capital of the Montana Territory in 1865. Settlers from the east followed the Bozeman Trail through Wyoming and eastern Montana, including the namesake city, and settlers from the south used the Virginia City branch of the Montana Trail from Utah and Idaho. After 10 years, the initial gold boom had ended, and the territorial capital moved to Helena in 1875. A second period of gold extraction came {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, when mechanical gold dredges arrived to tear up Alder Gulch to gather more gold. Gold dredge placer mining and some lode mining formed the basis of the area's economy until the gold ore was mostly exhausted; the dredge tailings along Alder Gulch remain a visible reminder of the area's mining past.|$|E

5|$|The first {{transportation}} routes along {{what is now}} US23 in {{the state}} were sections of two Indian trails. The route {{of what is now}} US23 follows portions of two separate trails. In the early 20th century, four different auto trail names were applied to roads now a part of the highway. These roads were included as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> state highways in the initial state highway system in 1919. When the United States Numbered Highway System was first designated on November 11, 1926, the new US23 replaced the other designations along its route. Since creation, the road has been moved and realigned several times. Through the 1930s and 1940s, the lakeshore routing was created to replace a path that ran further inland through the northern portion of the state. Starting in the early 1950s, various sections in the southeastern and central areas of the LP were upgraded to freeways, bypassing several major cities in the area. These improvements were completed {{by the end of the}} 1960s. Since then a new crossing of the Saginaw River at Zilwaukee was built to replace a drawbridge that carried the I-75/US23 freeway over a shipping channel.|$|E
5|$|The {{route of}} what became US2 {{was used as}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> Indian trails before European {{settlers}} came to the UP, {{and as part of}} the Michigan segments of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway and the King's International Highway auto trails in the early 20th century. The state later included these trails as part of M‑12 when the first state highway trunklines were designated in 1919. Most of M‑12 was redesignated as part of US2 when the US Highway System was created on November 11, 1926. Since the 1930s, several changes have reshaped the highway's routing through the UP. One such alteration eventually created a business loop that connected across the state line with Hurley, Wisconsin, and others pushed an originally inland routing of US2 closer to the Lake Michigan shoreline. With the creation of the Interstate Highway System, part of US2 was rerouted to coincide with the new Interstate 75 (I‑75), though in the 1980s, the U.S. Highway was truncated and removed from the I‑75 freeway, resulting in today's basic form.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the video, soil crumbles down, as Björk appears, buried to her waist in the sand, wearing a golden dress (by Michael van der Ham), a brooch on her shoulder designed by the singer herself and a blue wig, holding a rock. As she starts singing, she divides the rock into two pieces. As she waves the pieces, the sand around her stirs. She then lays the two pieces on the sand, and they become <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> rock sprites, that come out of the sand and start writhing around Björk, while strata emerges from them. In {{the end of the first}} verse, the strata of the two rocky sprites try to unite, as Björk grabs the sand and let it slips out from her fingers. During the second verse other rocks emerge from the sand and revolve around Björk, who dances in the sand. Other rocky sprites spring out of the new rocks and link to the main two, which are still spinning around the singer's head. The two parts are irresistibly attracted to each other and try to unite as they are stroked by Björk. The strata of the rocks morph to form a face, similar to that of the singer. As the chorus begins, Björk disappears in the darkness. The two rocky parts, now united, start to bestir themselves, whilst various rocks on the sand start to erupt. Lava, magma, smoke and fire storm while Björk's face appears in the lava. Every rock erupts noisily, causing a rain of volcanic ash.|$|E
