40|$|Electromagnetic welding {{apparatus}} {{has been developed}} for welding aluminum tubes to core bars. This apparatus consists of ten paper-oil type capacitors, {{and can be used}} the following three kinds of combinations of capacitance, <b>proof</b> <b>voltage,</b> internal inductance and internal resistance by changing the connection of capacitors : (i) C 0 = 1, 140 μF, <b>proof</b> <b>voltage</b> of 5 kV, L 0 = 1. 9 μH, R 0 = 9 mΩ. (ⅱ) C 0 = 2, 320 μF, <b>proof</b> <b>voltage</b> of 5 kV, L 0 = 2. 1 μH, R 0 = 5 mΩ. (ⅲ) C 0 = 580 μF, <b>proof</b> <b>voltage</b> of 10 kV, L 0 = 2. 5 μH, R 0 = 2. 5 mΩ. Welded joints with the wavy interfaces, which are characterisitic of high energy rate welding processes, can be obtained by using this apparatus. This welded interface doesn't include the contaminated surface layers. The factors which affect the results of electromagnetic welding, such as the inductance of coil, the clearance between tube and core bar, and the ratio of thickness to diameter of tube (D/T), are also examined. The most successful performance of welded joint is obtained by coil inductance of 3 μH and the clearance of 3 mm. The larger the (D/T) ratio is, the more easily the welding is performed...|$|E
25|$|The <b>voltage</b> <b>proof</b> {{of ceramic}} {{capacitors}} is specified as rated voltage (UR).

25|$|The {{separation}} of the electrodes and the <b>voltage</b> <b>proof</b> of the dielectric material defines the breakdown voltage of the capacitor. The breakdown voltage {{is proportional to the}} thickness of the dielectric.|$|R
25|$|Because of the {{extremely}} thin oxide layer, which {{corresponds to a}} <b>voltage</b> <b>proof</b> of about 1.5V, their specific capacitance is, however, much {{higher than that of}} anode foils.

25|$|Theoretically, {{given two}} {{capacitors}} {{with the same}} mechanical dimensions and dielectric, {{but one of them}} have half the thickness of the dielectric. With the same dimensions this one could place twice the parallel-plate area inside.

25|$|This {{assumes that}} neither the {{electrode}} surfaces nor the permittivity of the dielectric change with the <b>voltage</b> <b>proof.</b> A simple comparison with two existing capacitor series can show whether reality matches theory. The comparison is easy, because the manufacturers use standardized case sizes or boxes for different capacitance/voltage values within a series.|$|R
25|$|If {{the ripple}} current exceeds the rated value, the {{corresponding}} heat generation exceeds the capacitor's temperature limit and may destroy the internal structure (<b>voltage</b> <b>proof,</b> boiling point) of the capacitors. Then the components tend to short circuiting, vent opening or explosion. Ripple currents higher than rated values are possible only with forced cooling.|$|R

25|$|The {{safety margin}} for solid {{tantalum}} capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte is typically between 2 and 4.

25|$|It {{follows that}} the total {{capacitance}} of the capacitor Ce-cap is mainly determined by the anode capacitance CA when the cathode capacitance CK is very large compared with the anode capacitance CA. This requirement is given when the cathode capacitance CK is approximately 10 {{times higher than the}} anode capacitance CA. This can be easily achieved because the natural oxide layer on a cathode surface has a <b>voltage</b> <b>proof</b> of approximately 1.5V and is therefore very thin.|$|R
25|$|In reality modern {{capacitor}} series {{do not fit}} the theory.

50|$|To {{compare this}} figure with values from other {{capacitor}} types requires an estimation for electrolytic capacitors, the capacitors with the thinnest dielectric among conventional capacitors. The <b>voltage</b> <b>proof</b> of aluminum oxide, the dielectric layer of aluminum electrolytic capacitors, is approximately 1.4 nm/V. For a 6.3 V capacitor therefore the layer is 8.8 nm. The electric field is 6.3 V/8.8 nm = 716 kV/mm, around 7 times {{lower than in}} the double-layer. The field strength of some 5000 kV/mm is unrealizable in conventional capacitors. No conventional dielectric material could prevent charge carrier breakthrough. In a double-layer capacitor the chemical stability of the solvent's molecular bonds prevents breakthrough.|$|R
5000|$|The {{dielectric}} thickness is in {{the range}} of nanometers per volt. On the other hand, the breakdown voltage of these oxide layers are quite high. Together with etched or sintered anodes with its much higher surface compared to a smooth surface of the same area or the same volume e-caps can achieve a high volumetric capacitance. Latest developments in high etched or sintered anodes increases the capacitance value, depending on the rated voltage, by a factor of up to 200 for Al-e-caps or Ta-e-caps compared with smooth anodes. Because the forming voltage defines the oxide thickness, the <b>voltage</b> <b>proof</b> can be produced simply for the desired rated value.

25|$|At {{a reverse}} voltage lower than −1.5V at room temperature, the cathode {{aluminum}} foil begins {{to build up}} an oxide layer corresponding to the applied voltage. This is aligned with generating hydrogen gas with increasing pressure. At {{the same time the}} oxide layer on the anode foil begins dissolution of the oxide, which weakens the <b>voltage</b> <b>proof.</b> It is now a question of the outside circuit whether the increasing gas pressure from oxidization leads to bursting of the case, or the weakened anode oxide leads to a breakdown with a short circuit. If the outside circuit is high-ohmic the capacitor fails and the vent opens due to high gas pressure. If the outside circuit is low-ohmic, an internal short circuit is more probable. In every case a reverse voltage lower than −1.5V at room temperature may cause the component to catastrophically fail due to a dielectric breakdown or overpressure, which causes the capacitor to burst, often in a spectacularly dramatic fashion. Modern electrolytic capacitors have a safety vent that is typically either a scored section of the case or a specially designed end seal to vent the hot gas/liquid, but ruptures can still be dramatic.|$|R
40|$|This study investigates energy {{harvesting}} characteristics from a spinning device {{that consists of}} a proof mass that is supported by two orthogonal elastic structures with the piezoelectric material. Deformation in the piezoelectric structures due to vibration of the <b>proof</b> mass generates <b>voltages</b> to power electrical loads. The governing equations for this electromechanically coupled device are derived using Newtonian mechanics and Kirchhoff 2 ̆ 7 s voltage law. The case where the device rotates at a constant speed and is subjected to sinusoidal base excitation is examined in detail. The {{energy harvesting}} behavior is investigated for devices with identical piezoelectric support structures (called tuned devices). Closed-form expressions are derived for the steady state response and power harvested. For nonzero rotation speeds, these devices have multifrequency dynamic response and power harvested due to the combined vibration and rotation of the host system. The average power harvested for one oscillation cycle is calculated {{for a wide range}} of operating conditions to quantify the devices 2 ̆ 7 performance. Resonances do not occur for cases when the base excitation frequency is fixed and the rotation speed varies. For cases of fixed rotation speed and varying base excitation frequency, however, resonances do occur. The number and location of these resonances depend on the electrical circuit resistances and rotation speed. Resonances do not occur at speeds or frequencies predicted by resonance diagrams, which are commonly used in the study of rotating system vibration. These devices have broadband speed energy harvesting ability. They perform equally well at high and low speeds; high speeds are not necessary for their optimal performance. The impact of the chosen damping model on energy harvesting characteristics for tuned devices is investigated. Two common damping models are considered: viscous damping and structural (hysteretic) damping. Closed-form expressions for steady state dynamic response and power harvested are derived for models with viscous and structural damping. The average power harvested using the model with structural damping behaves similarly at high speeds and low speeds, and at high resistances and low resistances. For the viscous damping model, however, the average power harvested is meaningfully different at high speeds compared to low speeds, and at high resistances compared to low resistances. The characteristics of devices with nonidentical piezoelectric support structures (called mistuned devices) are investigated numerically. Similar to spinning tuned devices, mistuned devices have multifrequency dynamic response and power harvested. In contrast to tuned devices, high amplitude average power harvested occurs near speeds and base excitation frequencies predicted by resonance diagram...|$|R
