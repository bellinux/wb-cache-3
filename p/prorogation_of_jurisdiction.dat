50|$|The Article 23 of the Regulation (2012 recast: Article 25) {{regulates the}} right of parties to {{determine}} (within boundaries) the court which professional parties may choose (<b>prorogation</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> or choice of forum). The article stipulates that unless the parties have agreed otherwise, this jurisdiction is exclusive; however, unlike the exclusivity under Article 22 of the Regulation (2012 recast: Article 24), a judgment denying a choice of court agreement or its conditions cannot be refused recognition.|$|E
40|$|The article {{examines}} the possibility and the restrictions on <b>prorogation</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and electio legis about bond loans issued by Italian companies, aimed at istitutional investors operating in Europe. The bond loan, in the part where it regulates relations between bondholders and the Company – and hence, as regards the quorum and the roles assigned to bondholders’ meeting by art. 2415 c. c. - is governed by lex societatis. This {{is not the case}} for the common representative of the bondholders: his election, in fact, is not mandatory. However, the powers and functions granted and assigned to it by law, not olny do correspond to the interest of the bondholders but also to those of the Company. Therefore, if a representative of bondholders is appointed, he will be subject to the lex societatis: he will assume the tasks and the powers indicated by italian law, regardless of the governing law chosen by the parties. With regard to the questions concerning the validity of the decisions of the bondholders’ meeting and the powers and the duties conferred upon them the <b>prorogation</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and the derogation from italian law are unlawful. The English court seised has to decline jurisdiction because the matter is reserved to the italian exclusive jurisdiction and law. The same applies to the common representative of the bondholders only in the case of insolvency procedures, or when he (or her) is voluntary appointed...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{provides}} an overview of party autonomy with regard to jurisdictional rules under the recent EU private international law regulations on family and succession matters, by addressing the issue from a teleological, systematic and analytical point of view. Accordingly, the paper analyses the (specific) legislative policies underlying the <b>prorogation</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and the interplay between the choice-of-law and the choice-of-court in these matters. It finally examines the content and modalities of the electio fori {{in the context of the}} instruments concerned, adopted or proposed by the European Institutions in relation to family and succession matters. This investigation demonstrates that prorogation has a restricted role in this area, both in the manner of determining the competent court to adjudicate the case and in relation to the formal requirements for validity. Furthermore, the article highlights some asymmetries in the overall regulatory framework of party autonomy as electio fori and electio legis: i. e. the lack of party autonomy in matrimonial matters under Regulation (EC) No 2201 / 2003 and the imperfect parallelism between jus and forum in certain areas of family and succession law...|$|E
