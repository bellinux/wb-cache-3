30|$|However, we {{observed}} no increased FCdiene production using this strategy, suggesting that accumulated biomass from batch phase {{does not necessarily}} behave as a directly pH unregulated batch culture.

In accordance with previously reported ergosterol production from S. cerevisiae, the FCdiene production here seemed to be inhibited by nitrogen concentrations of <b>pH</b> <b>regulated</b> fed-batch phase (Shang et al. 2006). For this reason a glucose fed-batch is actually the proposed strategy to generate reproducible high FCdiene product concentrations.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to demonstrate that asymmetric membrane capsules can be used to deliver a poorly water soluble drug with a pH dependent solubility, such as carvedilol, for extended periods of time by modulating solubility with acid. In this study, the effect of the concentration of <b>pH</b> <b>regulating</b> agent and osmotic agents on the release rate of the active material was investigated. For this purpose, asymmetric membrane capsules of carvedilol were prepared using cellulose acetate as a semi-permeable membrane, containing glycerol as plasticizer, and fructose and fumaric acid were used as osmotic agent and <b>pH</b> <b>regulating</b> agent, respectively. In osmotic systems, the release rate of an excipient relative to the release rate of the drug is an important factor that determines the duration of drug release. Owing to high acidic strength and low aqueous solubility, fumaric acid resulted in simultaneous release and maintained a constant micro-environmental condition for the dissolution of the weakly basic drug. Finally, it was observed that the release rate of carvedilol was influenced by the concentration of fumaric acid and fructose. The optimal formulation was found to be able to deliver carvedilol at the rate of approximate zero-order up to 20 h, independent of release media and agitation rate...|$|R

In addition, other two kinds of pH indicators were chosen and regulated to their color transition points as well.

40|$|Drug {{delivery}} system (DDS) {{is crucial for}} modern cancer treatment. Traditional drug delivery process is to load drugs into various carriers via physical interactions, which always {{gives rise to the}} burst release and leakage of the loaded drugs. This thesis aims to develop a novel delivery platform with controlled and sustained drug release ability, where doxorubicin (DOX, a model anticancer drug) is conjugated to the surfaces of model carriers, silica nanoparticles (SNs), via different “smart” linkers. pH and glutathione(GSH) are utilizedas the stimuli of these “smart” linkers to construct pH and intracellular microenvironment redox responsive drug-carrier conjugated {{delivery system}}s to selectively deliver drugs. The <b>pH</b> <b>regulated</b> drug delivery system was developed to conjugate DOX to the surfaces of silica nanoparticles by acid responsive hydrazone bonds. The drug delivery system showed good stability under physiological pH of 7. 4 to avoid premature drug leakage in blood circulation, and sustained release under acidic extracellular environment of cancer cells to effectively inhibit tumor growth. In vitro cytotoxicity study against Hela cells and HEK 293 cells indicated the drug delivery system revealed such a system could release more drugs in tumor cells than normal cells. The intracellular microenvironment redox responsive drug delivery system was established by introducing dithiodibutyric acid (DTDB), which contained redox responsive disulfide bonds, to silica nanoparticle surfaces. In the absence of reducing reagents of GSH or dithiothreitol (DTT), such a drug delivery system presented good stability to prevent drug leakage, but in the presence of GSH or DTT, the disulfide bonds could be effectively cleaved to release the preloaded drugs. The in vitro cytotoxicity study indicated this drug delivery system could be stable in blood circulation and effectively released the preloaded drugs inside cells after conjugation. Due to the different GSH levels in cancer cells and normal cells, intracellular microenvironment redox responsive system could be more toxic to cancer cells. In summary, DOX-silica nanoparticles conjugates with <b>pH</b> <b>regulated</b> hydrazone bonds or intracellular microenvironment redox responsive disulfide bonds had the capability in controlled and sustained drug release, which could effectively eliminate drug leakage during the delivery course and release sufficient amount of drugs in tumors to inhibit their growth.

40|$|Abstract Background In Escherichia coli, <b>pH</b> <b>regulates</b> {{genes for}} amino-acid and sugar catabolism, {{electron}} transport, oxidative stress, periplasmic and envelope proteins. Many pH-dependent genes are co-regulated by anaerobiosis, {{but the overall}} intersection of pH stress and oxygen limitation has not been investigated. Results The pH dependence of gene expression was analyzed in oxygen-limited cultures of E. coli K- 12 strain W 3110. E. coli K- 12 strain W 3110 was cultured in closed tubes containing LBK broth buffered at pH 5. 7, pH 7. 0, and pH 8. 5. Affymetrix array hybridization revealed pH-dependent expression of 1, 384 genes and 610 intergenic regions. A core group of 251 genes showed pH responses {{similar to those in}} a previous study of cultures grown with aeration. The highly acid-induced gene yagU was shown to be required for extreme-acid resistance (survival at pH 2). Acid also up-regulated fimbriae (fimAC), periplasmic chaperones (hdeAB), cyclopropane fatty acid synthase (cfa), and the "constitutive" Na+/H+ antiporter (nhaB). Base up-regulated core genes for maltodextrin transport (lamB, mal), ATP synthase (atp), and DNA repair (recA, mutL). Other genes showed opposite pH responses with or without aeration, for example ETS components (cyo, nuo, sdh) and hydrogenases (hya, hyb, hyc, hyf, hyp). A hypF strain lacking all hydrogenase activity showed loss of extreme-acid resistance. Under oxygen limitation only, acid down-regulated ribosome synthesis (rpl, rpm, rps). Acid up-regulated the catabolism of sugar derivatives whose fermentation minimized acid production (gnd, gnt, srl), and also a cluster of 13 genes in the gadA region. Acid up-regulated drug transporters (mdtEF, mdtL), but down-regulated penicillin-binding proteins (dacACD, mreBC). Intergenic regions containing regulatory sRNAs were up-regulated by acid (ryeA, csrB, gadY, rybC). Conclusion <b>pH</b> <b>regulates</b> a core set of genes independently of oxygen, including yagU, fimbriae, periplasmic chaperones, and nhaB. Under oxygen limitation, however, pH regulation is reversed for genes encoding electron transport components and hydrogenases. Extreme-acid resistance requires yagU and hydrogenase production. Ribosome synthesis is down-regulated at low pH under oxygen limitation, possibly due to the restricted energy yield of catabolism. Under oxygen limitation, <b>pH</b> <b>regulates</b> metabolism and transport so as to maximize alternative catabolic options while minimizing acidification or alkalinization of the cytoplasm. </p...|$|R

For the homeostatic pH regulation in the compartments like cytoplasm and endosomal lumen are performed by H+ transporting membrane integral proteins. One of these is the Na+ /H+ exchanger (NHE or Nha). Here the roles of Na+ /H+ exchangers in the cells are summarized based on our recent ﬁndings.

The influence of CO 2 flowrate (30, 100 and 500 mL/min) was evaluated. Results showed a decrease in biological hydrogen production for a sparging flowrate of 500 mLCO 2 /min, similar performances for the control experiments and for a sparging flowrate of 100 mLCO 2 /min and an increase in biohydrogen production for a sparging flowrate of 30 mLCO 2 /min. For this latter operating condition, a substantial improvement in hydrogen production performances was obtained with an increase in the hydrogen yield by more than 20 % and a decrease in the chemicals consumption used to maintain the pH by more than 20 %. No shift in the metabolic pathways and in the bacterial community structure was observed but positive bacterial interactions occurred and enhanced the hydrogen production. Therefore, this study suggested that the growth of hydrogen producing bacteria could be either enhanced or slowed down by a CO 2 sparging pretreatment depending on the level of CO 2 flowrate, the shift being close to 100 mLCO 2 /min...|$|E

Measurement of the primary productivity in Silver Springs and Green Cove Springs by two new methods: the raising of organisms in cages, and the measurement of night & day differences in oxygen downstream agree roughly. Production in these springs is greater than previous production figures reported for marine, fresh water, and land areas.

Northern experiments indicated that papA gene was <b>pH</b> <b>regulated,</b> repressed by ammonium, glucose and glycerol, and induced by organic nitrogen sources. The promoter possessed potential AreA, PacC and MYC sites for nitrogen, pH and mycoparasitism regulation respectively, but lacked potential CreA sites for carbon regulation. IEF and zymograms indicated that PAPA was a pepstatin-sensitive aspartyl protease of pI 4 � 5. Transformants from T. harzianum CECT 2413 cultivated in yeast extract-supplemented medium overexpressed papA and had a fourfold increase in protease activity compared to the wild-type, while transformants that overexpressed the β- 1, 6 -glucanase gene bgn 16. 2 and papA had an additional 30 % increase in β- 1, 6 -glucanase activity compared to bgn 16. 2 single transformants.

40|$|Helicobacter pylori infects and {{persistently}} colonizes the stomach, {{which results}} in gastritis and in some individuals peptic ulcer disease or gastric cancer. Adherence of H. pylori to the epithelium {{is an important factor}} for development of disease. Attachment is mediated by the adhesins BabA and SabA that binds the ABO/Leb blood group antigens and sialylated glycoconjugates respectively.  High-affinity attachment could be anticipated to be of disadvantage for H. pylori because epithelial cells have a fast turnover rate and the dislocated and shed epithelial cells would carry attached bacteria to the acidic gastric juice in the lumen. However, here we describe that H. pylori manage to adapt to this innate clearance mechanism by unique acid regulatory binding properties of its adhesins. We propose that <b>pH</b> <b>regulated</b> binding properties enable bacteria to detachment from host cells for chemotactic guided motility and successful return to the more neutral epithelium for a fresh restart of the infectious cycle. By comparison of BabA from different stomach loci we identified amino acid key position for acid regulated binding activity. Previous studies found lower prevalence of Leb-binding among H. pylori isolates from southern Europe compared to Sweden. Here we tested if the reduced prevalence of Leb-binding could be explained by a novel binding mode; in among Spanish strains, we identified S 812 that demonstrates preference for multivalent binding to ABO antigens in glycolipids; we found that 812 BabA had drifted in its preferred binding epitope away from the consensus a 1, 2 fucosylation and towards the blood group A and B derivatives. Such epitope drift might in particular optimize binding to ABO antigens in densely packed lipid rafts. In parallel, we studied the influence of BabA for disease progression by an inventory of gastric biopsies. BabA correlated both with the oncoprotein CagA, the VacAs 1 toxin and, in addition, to severe disease progression. We further correlate BabA expression with positive secretor phenotype and stronger adhesion of H. pylori in vitro.

40|$|The {{filamentous}} fungus Dothistroma septosporum infects pine species {{throughout the world}} causing red-band disease, {{one of the most}} serious diseases of conifer species. In NZ, a clonally derived asexual strain of D. septosporum was identified in 1964, and has spread throughout the country. There are conflicting accounts on the environmental conditions required for infection, which has lead to difficulties in optimizing a laboratory-based system for infection. The pathogen is spread naturally through rain-splashed inoculum of conidiospores from mature stromata that have erupted through the pine needle tissue. Diseased needles become necrotic, often with a red band due to the mycotoxin dothistromin produced by the hyphae. Dothistromin has the chemical structure of a difuranoanthraquinone and shows similarity to the aflatoxin precursor, versicolorin B produced by Aspergillus parasiticus. The role of dothistromin in pathogenicity has not yet been determined, although experiments have shown injecting toxin into pine needles results in the characteristic red band lesion. In this study it was found that fluctuating temperature (16 °C/ 24 °C), a 12 h diurnal cycle (white and ultraviolet light), high relative humidity and continuous moisture are conditions conducive to development of red-band disease on inoculated pine trees in an artificial environment. A higher rate of infection was obtained using pine seedlings as opposed to pine cuttings, and using a spore suspension containing a yeast extract. A dothistromin minus mutant was able to infect pine needles, indicating that dothistromin is not a pathogenicity factor, though it may be a virulence factor. The use of GFP-expressing isolates allowed the initial infection process to be monitored with both wild type and mutant isolates. Additionally, a PCR-based diagnostic procedure to confirm infection was developed. The production of aflatoxin by Aspergillus species is regulated by nutritional parameters and extracellular pH, which affect both growth and aflatoxin gene expression. D. septosporum similarly has enhanced growth at acidic pH, but it does not appear that pH has a strong influence on physiological processes as toxin biosynthesis and gene expression do not appear to be <b>pH</b> <b>regulated.</b> Different carbon and nitrogen sources also affect the morphology of D. septosporum...|$|E

40|$|Background: Recent studies {{designed}} {{to identify the}} mechanism by which retinal horizontal cells communicate with cones have implicated two processes. According to one account, horizontal cell hyperpolarization induces an increase in pH within the synaptic cleft that activates the calcium current (Ca 2 +-current) in cones, enhancing transmitter release.

Their NPQ mechanism has been principally attributed to a xanthophyll cycle involving the lumenal <b>pH</b> <b>regulated</b> reversible de-epoxidation of diadinoxanthin. The principal goal of this dissertation is to reveal the physiological and physical origins and consequences of the NPQ response in diatoms during short-term transitions to excessive irradiation. The investigation involves diatom species from different originating light environs to highlight the diversity of diatom NPQ and to facilitate the detection of core mechanisms common among the diatoms as a group. A chiefly spectroscopic approach was used to investigate NPQ in diatom cells. Prime methodologies include: the real time monitoring of PSII excitation and de-excitation pathways via PAM fluorometry and pigment interconversion via transient absorbance measurements, the collection of cryogenic absorbance spectra to measure pigment energy levels, and the collection of cryogenic fluorescence spectra and room temperature picosecond time resolved fluorescence decay spectra to study excitation energy transfer and dissipation. Chemical inhibitors that target the trans-thylakoid pH gradient, the enzyme responsible for diadinoxanthin de-epoxidation, and photosynthetic electron flow were additionally used to experimentally manipulate the NPQ response. Multifaceted analyses of the NPQ responses from two previously un-photosynthetically characterised species, Nitzschia curvilineata and Navicula sp., were used to identify an excitation pressure relief ‘strategy’ for each species. Three key areas of NPQ were examined: (i) the NPQ activation/deactivation processes, (ii) how NPQ affects the collection, dissipation, and usage of absorbed light energy, and (iii) the interdependence of NPQ and photosynthetic electron flow. It was found that Nitzschia cells regulate excitation pressure via performing a high amplitude, reversible antenna based quenching which {{is dependent on the}} de-epoxidation of diadinoxanthin. In Navicula cells excitation pressure could be effectively regulated solely within the PSII reaction centre, whilst antenna based, diadinoxanthin de-epoxidation dependent quenching was implicated {{to be used as a}} supplemental, long-lasting source of excitation energy dissipation. These strategies for excitation balance were discussed in the context of resource partitioning under these species’ originating light climates. A more detailed investigation of the NPQ response in Nitzschia was used to develop a comprehensive model describing the mechanism for antenna centred non-photochemical quenching in this species. The experimental evidence was strongly supportive of a mechanism whereby: an acidic lumen triggers the diadinoxanthin de-epoxidation and protonation mediated aggregation of light harvesting complexes leading to the formation of quencher chlorophyll a-chlorophyll a dimers with short-lived excited states; quenching relaxes when a rise in lumen pH triggers the dispersal of light harvesting complex aggregates via deprotonation events and the input of diadinoxanthin. This model may also be applicable for describing antenna based NPQ in other diatom species...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Extracellular {{acidification}} {{occurs in}} the brain with elevated neural activity, increased metabolism, and neuronal injury. This reduction in pH can have profound effects on brain function because <b>pH</b> <b>regulates</b> essentially every single biochemical reaction. Therefore, {{it is not surprising}} to see that Nature evolves a family of proteins, the acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), to sense extracellular pH reduction. ASICs are proton-gated cation channels that are mainly expressed in the nervous system. In recent years, a growing body of literature has shown that acidosis, through activating ASICs, contributes to multiple diseases, including ischemia, multiple sclerosis, and seizures. In addition, ASICs {{play a key role in}} fear and anxiety related psychiatric disorders. Several recent reviews have summarized the importance and therapeutic potential of ASICs in neurological diseases, as well as the structure-function relationship of ASICs. However, there is little focused coverage on either the basic biology of ASICs or their contribution to neural plasticity. This review will center on these topics, with an emphasis on the synaptic role of ASICs and molecular mechanisms regulating the spatial distribution and function of these ion channels. </p...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of clean}} water in textile {{finishing}} is both common and very expensive. Effluent water subjected to advanced methods of physical, chemical, and biological treatment {{could be used for}} this purpose. However, information obtained from industry and the literature shows that effluent water obtained from different finishing processes may be reused without being totally purified. In this paper, a method is proposed to determine the viability of reusing effluent water obtained from different textile finishing processes of cotton fabrics after just basic treatments. These treatments include; filtering, airing, <b>pH</b> <b>regulating</b> and ion exchange. Effluent water obtained in different textile finishing processes was analysed in terms of pH value, COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand), SS (Suspended Solids), colour, hardness and conductivity. Effluent water for treatment and the process where the treated water was reused were determined by means of the proposed method, based on a multiple criteria decision making approach. A laboratory scale trial was conducted to investigate the efficiency of treatment. Key words: Textile effluent, wastewater, treatment, multiple criteria decision making...|$|R
40|$|The {{microflora}} and pH of gastric contents {{were determined}} in breast-fed and in bottle-fed normal infants, in well nourished infants with acute diarrhoea and in infants with chronic diarrhoea and protein-calorie malnutrition. The last group of infants was reevaluated after recovery from diarrhoea and protein-calorie malnutrition. A bactericidal pH effect below 2 - 5 was observed. Bottle-fed controls had low pH values and low bacterial concentrations, whereas infants with chronic diarrhoea and protein-calorie malnutrition had high pH values and bacterial overgrowth, essentially of Gram-negative bacilli. After recovery, {{the only remaining}} alteration was the frequent isolation of yeast-like fungi in low concentrations. Infants with acute diarrhoea, except for the isolation more frequently of yeast-like fungi, presented no alterations; this {{seems to indicate that}} pH alterations and Gram-negative bacilli overgrowth occurred during the evolution of the disease to a chronic state. Breast-fed normal infants had hydrogen-ion concentrations {{similar to those of the}} chronic diarrhoea group, but without Gram-negative bacilli overgrowth, suggesting that other factors, besides <b>pH,</b> <b>regulate</b> bacterial growth in the gastric contents of these groups of infants...|$|R
