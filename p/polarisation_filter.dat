50|$|In gemology/gemmology, the {{gemstone}} refractometer is one {{the fundamental}} {{pieces of equipment}} used in a gemological laboratory. Gemstones are transparent minerals and can therefore be examined using optical methods. Refractive index is a material constant, dependent on the chemical composition of a substance. The refractometer is used to help identify gem materials by measuring their refractive index, {{one of the principal}} properties used in determining the type of a gemstone. Due to the dependence of the refractive index on the wavelength of the light used (i.e. dispersion), the measurement is normally taken at the wavelength of the sodium line D-line (NaD) of ~589 nm. This is either filtered out from daylight or generated with a monochromatic light-emitting diode (LED). Certain stones such as rubies, sapphires, tourmalines and topaz are optically anisotropic. They demonstrate birefringence based on the polarisation plane of the light. The two different refractive indexes are classified using a <b>polarisation</b> <b>filter.</b> Gemstone refractometers are available both as classic optical instruments and as electronic measurement devices with a digital display.|$|E

Sequences of images have been recorded with in front of these cameras a rotating <b>polarisation</b> <b>filter.</b> Due to optical distortion of the rotating filter the sequence contains apparent motion. This motion is estimated from the images and corrected using bilinear interpolation. From the motion corrected sequences both the unpolarised intensity and the polarisation parameters are estimated. The detection performance is evaluated with Receiver Operator Characteristics curves. It is shown that, for higher detection rates, classifiers based on polarisation features perform better than classifiers based on the intensity cue only. The linear combination of both has the best overall performance for the scenes considered. The infrared camera outperforms the visual light camera in the difficult scene...|$|E

40|$|The {{infrared}} (IR) radiation emitted or {{reflected in}} an off-normal direction from a smooth surface is partially polarised. This principle {{can be used}} for enhanced discrimination of targets from backgrounds in a marine environment. It has been shown that (man-made) targets do not demonstrate a pronounced polarisation effect when observed from near normal direction whereas the sea background radiation has a certain degree of polarisation in slant observation path. A measurement setup has been constructed for collecting polarised IR imagery.

40|$|Linear {{polarisation}} of Thermal InfraRed (TIR) radiation occurs whenever {{radiation is}} reflected or emitted from a smooth surface (such {{as the top}} of a landmine) and observed from a grazing angle. The background (soil and vegetation) is generally much rougher and therefore has less pronounced linear polarised radiation. This difference in polarisation can be used to enhanced detection of land mines using TIR cameras. A measurement setup is constructed for measurement of polarised TIR images. This setup contains a rotating <b>polarisation</b> <b>filter</b> which rotates synchronously with the frame sync of the camera.

40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) A camera {{navigation}} system was developed that attempted {{to mimic the}} way bees navigate using polarisation patterns of light. Initially, a simulation was performed to determine the mathematic calculations involved in transforming polarisation patterns into compass heading relative to the sun. Next, a simple inexpensive camera system was deployed to determine feasibility using ordinary cameras with <b>polarisation</b> <b>filters.</b> The final step involved taking this simple system {{and replacing it with}} a high-end camera system using fish eye lenses and mounting it on a fixed-wing model aircraft. This last step extended the work of previous researchers who had either only used filtered photodiode arrays on fixed-wing aircraft or filtered cameras on a non-pitching and non-rolling rotating wing aircraft (quad-copter). It was found that despite pitch and roll of the aircraft, a standard deviation of approximately 30 ° was achieved relative to true heading values obtained from the aircraft's flight computer.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an airborne experiment using horizontal and vertical polarising filters on a pair of co-mounted 12. 8 megapixel Canon 5 D digital cameras. These cameras were mounted in the underside camera port of a light aircraft, both cameras inclined at 30 degrees off-nadir. One camera had the <b>polarisation</b> <b>filter</b> oriented vertically and the other oriented horizontally. Forward-looking, overlapping, oblique aerial photography was captured over known seagrass meadows off the Adelaide metropolitan coastline, plus inland urban water bodies. The portrait oriented field of view allowed a progression on the image from near-nadir to beyond the critical Brewster angle of 53 degrees. Results show the removal of sky reflectance, turbulence and wave action on the vertically-oriented filter imagery compared to the horizontally-oriented filter imagery in both clear and turbid waters. For clear waters the removal of sky reflectance, waves and surface turbulence allowed visualisation of the seafloor suitable for benthic mapping in areas of seagrass. However in turbid water the removal of surface effects still did not allow the seafloor to be visualised due to multiple scatter {{in the body of the}} water. This method therefore also has application in differentiating clear and turbid waters on oblique photography...|$|E
40|$|During the False Bay trial (June 2007), the {{performance}} of a set of three optical sensors was tested against several small surface targets in a coastal area: a hyperspectral camera, a camera with a rotating polarization filter and a high resolution camera. One objective was the validation of a contrast and clutter model for the visual spectral band in this type of scenarios. Another issue was to test the benefit of using a <b>polarisation</b> <b>filter</b> and a hyperspectral unit in front of standard TV cameras. Finally the loss in identification capability of a high resolution camera at long range due to atmospheric blur was investigated. Data were collected of targets in near-sun direction at ranges up to seven kilometers, in all cases for down looking angles (targets below the horizon). Environmental parameters such as solar irradiance and windspeed were measured as input for the contrast and clutter models. Spatial, spectral and temporal effects of the target contrast and of the background clutter behaviour in the visual spectral band were determined as function of range and compared with model predictions. Samples of data and predictions are presented in this paper. The spatial and temporal target characteristics are of key importance for the development of algorithms for target detection, classification and tracking.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem of the rate of release of alkalis from coal/coal blends as they are burnt in Utility Boilers with the aim of {{evolving}} better models of the effect of given fuel blends on slagging and fouling in real boiler situations. Although numerous slagging and fouling indices have been evolved over many years to describe the behaviour of coals in given boiler situations they often fail to give the required results and prove to be of little use when co-firing blends of coal with biomass materials. In this work we have constructed a natural gas flat flame burner with associated furnace and viewing ports so we can use a PLIF system to look at the evolution of sodium from burning coal/coal blend particles and relate this to the condition of the ash in the burning coal particle as the ash particle reaches the region of the superheater tubes in a boiler. By appropriate adjustment of the air fuel ratio we can produce temperature/residence time distributions downstream of the flat flame burner and in the furnace section which closely parallel those found in Utility Boilers. Pulverised coal particles as produced for boiler firing are sieved into two fractions, those in the size range 67 to 37 microns and above 67 microns (virtually no residue was found below 37 microns). This was to ensure that the finer fraction had a narrow size distribution, which devolatilised and burnt in a time frame commensurate with that of our system Particle velocities could be readily measured by streak velocity using the available PLIF camera via their radiation signal produced from their combustion process. The camera was aligned such that the initial devolatilisation process was not observed as the associated radiation could mask the PLIF image; this proved to be satisfactory as significant sodium evolution did not occur until {{after the end of the}} devolatilisation process. PLIF images of the sodium evolution were generated via excitation of the D₂ line at 16960. 95 cm⁻¹ with collection via a gated intensified CCD camera (Princeton Instruments ICCD- 576). Four groups of images (500 images per set) were generated and collected at each setting to ensure accuracy of results, with a <b>polarisation</b> <b>filter</b> to minimize interference from Mie scattering with the sodium fluorescence. Novel results have thus been produced which will allow the evolution of better models for predicting slagging and fouling, especially when the work is extended to other volatile species in coal ash.

40|$|Bad weather {{conditions}} including haze, fog, rain etc. degrade the picture quality which causes poor visualizations. Various {{methods have been}} proposed to eradicate the effects of above conditions. Initially, polarization filters were used to restore the foggy image. Though this method estimates airlight to quite good an extent {{but at the same}} time uses multiple images therefore, cannot be applied on dynamic scenes. In addition, it has very high time complexity. To overcome the use of multiple images Dark channel prior technique was used that effectively calculates the transmission map to restore the foggy image. For this purpose it requires usage of soft matting technique that causes halo effect and has high time complexity. We are of the opinion that if transmission map is calculated using dark channel prior and airlight is estimated using <b>polarisation</b> <b>filters,</b> the resultant process will not only have lower time complexity {{but at the same time}} overcomes the drawback of multiple images. The above mentioned technique is implemented in MATLAB- 9 and analysed in this paper. The results shows that usage of this hybrid approach gives quite better results...|$|R

It is today still a great experience to view high quality large format images with depth perception, exceptionally of virtual objects like reconstructions of the past or building projects. High quality presentation of computer graphics is provided by projection onto a transparent screen surface from behind. Image separation can be easily performed by <b>polarisation</b> <b>filters</b> {{in front of the}} projection lenses. It is necessary that the beholders carry polarized glasses. Interactive viewing in this context means, that the observer is able to select image pairs from the database, can zoom in and out, select the display details and sets the zero parallax to an arbitrary position. The selection must be simultaneously transferred to the second image of the stereoscopic pair. While each data projector is driven by its own computer, a PDA (personal digital assistant) is recommended to receive the instructions from the presenter or viewer.

40|$|Using three fibre {{gratings}} with excessively tilted {{structures in}} the cavity, we have experimentally demonstrated a multiwavelength switchable erbium-doped fibre ring laser system. The three tilted gratings act as in-fibre polariser and <b>polarisation</b> dependent loss <b>filters</b> to induce the polarisation hole burning effect in the cavity for {{the operation of the}} laser at single, double, triple and quadruple wavelengths. The laser system has demonstrated good stability under room temperature conditions and also achieved a high degree of polarization (~ 30 dB), high optical signal to noise ratio (up to 63 dB) and high side mode suppression (~ 50 dB). The system has also been investigated for temperature and strain sensing by subjecting the seeding fibre Bragg gratings (FBG) to temperature and strain variations. Since the loss band of the <b>polarisation</b> dependent loss <b>filter</b> is broader than the bandwidth of the seeding FBG, the laser output shifts in wavelength with the applied temperature and strain.

40|$|Specimen-induced aberrations are {{frequently}} encountered in high resolution microscopy, particularly when high numerical aperture lenses {{are used to}} image deep into biological specimens. These aberrations distort the focal spot causing reduction in resolution, signal level and contrast. Aberrations arise due to refractive index variations in the specimen. Adaptive optics {{has been used in}} microscopes to correct for these effects and restore optimum imaging performance. An adaptive element, such as a deformable mirror, is used to compensate for aberrations by introducing equal but opposite phase distortions to that introduced by the specimen. Most adaptive optics systems in microscopy have employed indirect optimisation schemes that require several exposures of the specimen before the correction phase can be determined. This could lead to photo-toxicity and is sometimes unsuitable for real-time imaging. Direct wavefront sensing can significantly decrease the time required for aberration measurements by using dedicated sensors, but has limitations, particularly when backscattered light is used from thick specimens. While similar research has been undertaken in ophthalmology where the imaged retina is approximately two-dimensional, this report extends that work to three-dimensional specimens in microscopes. Aberration correction has already been demonstrated in single-pass systems for scattering specimens, but have employed either indirect wavefront sensing techniques or fluorescent beads as guide stars. The use of a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor for direct wavefront sensing using backscattered light in a dual-pass system is investigated here. Out-of-focus rejection using an axial selectivity pinhole is studied, along with the phase smoothing effect that is dependant on the pinhole size. The effectiveness of using asymmetric illumination and detection paths, and <b>polarisation</b> <b>filtering</b> in the retrieval of phase information are also demonstrated. It is shown that whilst direct quantitative measurements are not possible for scattering specimens, the measurements could be used in closed-loop adaptive optics systems to correct aberrations.

40|$|Quantum dots contain several {{isolated}} two-level quantum systems, {{an ideal}} {{starting point for}} the creation of a qubit. A single quantum dot embedded within a chargetunable heterostructure can be optically isolated using confocal microscopy, and electrically manipulated using an applied voltage. This thesis presents progress towards full opto-electrical control over a single dot, with a specific interest in the creation of a fully controllable electrically triggered deterministic single photon source. Polarisation control was incorporated into the confocal microscope setup, and <b>polarisation</b> <b>filtering</b> was used to enhance the signal to noise ratio in photoluminescence studies. Weierstrass solid immersion lens technology was included in the microscope design in order to improve the collection efficiency of dot photoluminescence. Static voltages were applied over single dots. Time-resolved spectroscopy allows the identification of hole tunnelling from the dot to the capping layer-superlattice interface. Suppression of hole tunnelling is achieved by altering the wafer structure. Autocorrelation measurements exhibit a finite second-order correlation at zero time delay, which is attributed to hole recapture from the wetting layer. Resonant excitation of the neutral exciton results in the creation of a negative trion in a specific voltage regime. Photolithography and electron-beam evaporation were used to manufacture several micron-scale opto-electronic devices. Several changes were made with the intention of reducing the resistance and capacitance of the device, with respect to the original macroscopic design. Photoluminescence measurements show that single dots in the new devices are capable of responding to GHz bandwidth voltage pulses. Finally, GHz bandwidth voltage pulses were applied to several single quantum dots. Single and multiple electron charging was observed on the timescale of exciton recombination. Several memory bit variations were demonstrated, each with an electrically triggered read-out mechanism. Two electrically triggered deterministic single photon sources were demonstrated, one using CW non-resonant optical excitation, the other using pulsed resonant optical excitation. Lastly, rapid adiabatic passage was attempted, with mixed results. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Mapping {{of marine}} benthic flora using remote sensing {{techniques}} has, {{over the past}} decade, been used to locate environmentally stressed areas in the South Australian marine environment. These studies used panchromatic/colour aerial photography and/or medium resolution multispectral satellite imagery to create a time series showing location and rate of seagrass loss. While successful within their project parameters, these studies were limited by conditions at time of image capture, such as sun-glare, wave action and low contrast in deeper waters due to absorption and scattering. This research thesis reports the successful use of polarisation on the capture of visible and near infra-red optical imagery as a method to minimise these limiting factors. Two experimental test flights were undertaken using commercial off-the-shelf digital cameras mounted in the camera port of a light aircraft. The first flight compared vertical polarisation using co-mounted visible and infra-red cameras. The second flight compared vertical and horizontal polarisation using co-mounted identical visible spectrum cameras. The main finding of this series of airborne polarisation experiments is that sea surface reflection is removed by using vertically polarised filters at, and around, the Brewster angle of 53 degrees off nadir, especially when viewing sunwards. The effect is {{the same in the}} visible and infra-red parts of the spectrum. This reflection includes sky reflectance, lambertian sun glare, reflection due to wave action, and turbulence, but not direct solar specular reflection. Vertical <b>polarisation</b> <b>filters</b> improve the imaging of benthic flora compared to horizontally polarised imagery and, by extension, non-polarised imagery. The successful use of polarisation to remove surface reflectance over water is limited to imagery captured at or near the Brewster angle. By using successive overlapping frames this can be achieved, as shown by the experiments. Ideally all of the image should be at the Brewster angle. A conceptual design for a conical optical scanner which builds wide-swath imagery where each pixel in each band is solely a record of the vertically polarised signal at the Brewster Angle is presented {{as a result of these}} experiments.

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{describes}} position-sensitive devices (PSDs) {{and optical}} sensor systems suitable for industrial tracking and displacement sensing applications. The main application {{areas of the}} proposed sensors include automatic pointing of a rangefinder beam and measuring the lateral displacement of an object. A conventional tracking sensor is composed of a laser illuminator, a misfocused quadrant detector (QD) receiver and a corner cube retroreflector (CCR) attached to the target. The angular displacement of a target from the receiver optical axis is detected by illuminating the target and determining {{the direction of the}} reflection using the QD receiver. The main contribution of the thesis is related to the modifications proposed for this conventional construction in order to make its performance sufficient for industrial applications that require a few millimetre to submillimetre accuracy. The work includes sensor optical construction modifications and the designing of new types of PSDs. The conventional QD-based sensor, although electrically very sensitive, is not considered optimal for industrial applications since its precision is severely hampered by atmospheric turbulence due to the misfocusing needed for its operation. Replacing the CCR with a sheet reflector is found to improve the precision of the conventional sensor construction in outdoor beam pointing applications, and is estimated to allow subcentimetre precision over distances of up to 100 m under most operating conditions. Submillimetre accuracy is achievable in close-range beam pointing applications using a small piece of sheet reflector, coaxial illumination and a focused QD receiver. <b>Polarisation</b> <b>filtering</b> is found to be effective in eliminating the main error contributor in close-range applications, which is low reflector background contrast, especially in cases when a sheet reflector has a specularly reflecting background. The tracking sensor construction is also proposed for measuring the aiming trajectory of a firearm in an outdoor environment. This time an order of magnitude improvement in precision is achieved by replacing the QD with a focused lateral effect photodiode (LEP). Use of this construction in cases of intermediate atmospheric turbulence allows a precision better than 1 cm to be achieved up to a distance of 300 m. A method based on averaging the positions of multiple reflectors is also proposed in order to improve the precision in turbulence-limited cases. Finally, various types of custom-designed PSDs utilising a photodetector array structure are presented for long-range displacement sensing applications. The goal was to be able to replace the noisy LEP with a low-noise PSD without compromising the low turbulence sensitivity achievable with the LEP. An order of magnitude improvement in incremental sensitivity is achievable with the proposed array PSDs...|$|R
