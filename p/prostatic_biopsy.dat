Patients were randomized into 3 groups. Under TRUS guidance, group 1 (n= 20) received 10 ml of 1 % lignocaine at the apical area of the prostate, group 2 (n= 20) received 5 ml of 1 % lignocaine in the basolateral prostatic plexus bilaterally and group 3 (n= 20) received 10 ml of 1 % lignocaine at basolateral prostatic plexus unilaterally, using an 18 F needle. Five minutes after the injection, a series of 10 <b>prostatic</b> <b>biopsies</b> were performed. Pain during biopsy was assessed using visual analogue pain score. RESULTS: Patients with apical prostatic block had significantly lower pain scores (1. 5 ± 0. 9) than those with B/L (2. 6 ± 1. 2) and U/L basolateral prostatic plexus block (2. 8 ± 1. 4).

Patients were stratified {{into three groups}} based on their PSA: 4 - 10 ng/ml (group I), 10 - 20 ng/ml (group II), and > 20 ng/ml (group III).

The {{aim of this study}} is to establish any possible relation of reactive stroma grading on needle <b>prostatic</b> <b>biopsies</b> to biochemical recurrence. 				 				 					Materials and Methods 					The study group comprised 266 biopsies from consecutive patients submitted to radical prostatectomy. Reactive stroma was defined as stroma surrounding neoplastic tissue and graded as 0 (absent), 1 (slight), 2 (moderate), and 3 (intense) according to tumor stroma area relative to total tumor area. 				 				 					Results 					From the total of 266 needle <b>prostatic</b> <b>biopsies,</b> 143 (53. 8 %), 55 (20. 7 %), 54 (20. 3 %), and 14 (5. 3 %) showed grades 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Increasing reactive stroma grade was significantly associated with clinical stage T 2, higher preoperative PSA, higher biopsy and radical prostatectomy Gleason score, more extensive tumors in radical prostatectomy, and pathologic stage > T 2. Only grade 3 was significantly associated with time and risk to biochemical recurrence. On multivariate analysis only preoperative PSA and 2 methods of biopsy tumor extent evaluation were independent predictors. 				 				 					Conclusion 					Increasing reactive stroma grade on biopsies is significantly associated with several clinicopathologic adverse findings, however, only grade 3 predicts time and risk to biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy on univariate but not on multivariate analysis. We have not been able to show that reactive stroma grade 3 on biopsies is an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence beyond that of preoperative PSA and other pathologic findings on biopsy...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} the intra-individual (physiological) variation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements in men after a benign <b>prostatic</b> <b>biopsy.</b> Sixty-four men were prospectively assessed, {{all of whom}} had a benign <b>prostatic</b> <b>biopsy</b> within the preceding 13 months. The degree of intra-individual variability was established by calculating the coefficient of variation on four PSA levels obtained from each patient weekly over a month.

40|$|Gleason grading is {{the best}} {{independent}} predictor for prostate cancer (PCa) progression. Recently, a new PCa grading system has been introduced by the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) and is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Following studies observed more accurate and simplified grade stratification of the new system. Aim {{of this study was}} to compare the prognostic value of the new grade groups compared to the former Gleason Grading and to determine whether re-definition of Gleason Pattern 4 might reduce upgrading from prostate biopsy to radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. A cohort of men undergoing RP from 2002 to 2015 at the Hospital of Goeppingen (Goeppingen, Germany) was used for this study. In total, 339 pre-operative <b>prostatic</b> <b>biopsies</b> and corresponding RP specimens, as well as additional 203 RP specimens were re-reviewed for Grade Groups according to the ISUP. Biochemical recurrence-free survival (BFS) after surgery was used as endpoint to analyze prognostic significance. Other clinicopathological data included TNM-stage and pre-operative PSA level. Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed risk stratification of patients based on both former Gleason Grading and ISUP Grade Groups, and was statistically significant using the log-rank test (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Both grading systems significantly correlated with TNM-stage and pre-operative PSA level (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Higher tumor grade in RP specimen compared to corresponding pre-operative biopsy was observed in 44 and 34. 5 % of cases considering former Gleason Grading and ISUP Grade Groups, respectively. Both, former Gleason Grading and ISUP Grade Groups predict survival when applied on tumors in <b>prostatic</b> <b>biopsies</b> as well as RP specimens. This is the first validation study on a large representative German community-based cohort to compare the former Gleason Grading with the recently introduced ISUP Grade Groups. Our data indicate that the ISUP Grade Groups do not improve predictive value of PCa grading and might be less sensitive in deciphering tumors with 3 [*]+[*] 4 and 4 [*]+[*] 3 pattern on RP specimen. However, the Grade Group system results less frequently in an upgrading from biopsy to the corresponding RP specimens, indicating a lower risk to miss potentially aggressive tumors not represented on biopsies...|$|R
