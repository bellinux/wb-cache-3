5000|$|Sriranga Wasudev 'Ranga' Sohoni [...] (born 5 March 1918, Nimbahera, Rajasthan - died 19 May 1993, Thana, Maharashtra) was an Indian Test cricketer. He was an all-rounder, batting {{well under}} <b>pressure</b> and <b>bowling</b> relentlessly on South Asian surfaces.|$|R

25|$|Kerrigan played 13first-class {{matches in}} his first full season with Lancashire, taking 30wickets {{at an average of}} 32.23 {{including}} three five-wicket hauls. When Keedy returned from injury he and Kerrigan sometimes bowled together in the County Championship. However, their partnership was not initially ideal as they were attempting to out perform each other. After a discussion they decided they would be more effective if they worked together to build <b>pressure</b> while <b>bowling.</b>|$|R
25|$|In a warm up {{match against}} Durham before the 2010 season started, Keedy broke his collar bone. The injury left him unable {{to play for}} several months. In Keedy's absence, Lancashire's young spinners, Stephen Parry and Simon Kerrigan, were given {{opportunities}} in the first team. Kerrigan was chosen ahead of Parry in the four-day team and cemented {{his place in the}} side. When Keedy returned from injury he and Kerrigan sometimes bowled together in the County Championship. Their partnership began with them competing to out perform each other. After a discussion the pair decided they would be more effective if they worked together to build <b>pressure</b> while <b>bowling.</b> Keedy finished the season with 31first-class wickets at an average of 22.19.|$|R
40|$|Homogenous-charge-compression-ignition (HCCI) engines {{have the}} benefit of high {{efficiency}} with low emissions of NO and particulates. These benefits are due to the autoignition process of the dilute mixture of fuel and air during compression. Homogenous Compression ignition (HCCI) is a combustion concept, which is a hybrid between Otto engine and Diesel engine. The other emissions like HC and CO are high but can be after treated by a catalyst. This paper reviews the Characteristics of HCCI combustion in direct injection diesel engines under various governing factors in HCCI operations such as injection timing, injection <b>pressure,</b> piston <b>bowl</b> geometry, compression ratio, intake charge temperature, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and supercharging or turbo charging are discussed in this review. The effects of design and operating parameters on HCCI diesel combustion, emissions particularly NOx and soot are reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) {{combustion}} is a combustion concept {{which offers}} simultaneous reductions in both NOx and soot emissions from internal combustion engines. In light of increasingly stringent diesel emissions limits, research {{efforts have been}} invested into HCCI combustion {{as an alternative to}} conventional diesel combustion. This paper reviews the implementation of HCCI combustion in direct injection diesel engines using early, multiple and late injection strategies. Governing factors in HCCI operations such as injector characteristics, injection <b>pressure,</b> piston <b>bowl</b> geometry, compression ratio, intake charge temperature, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and supercharging or turbocharging are discussed in this review. The effects of design and operating parameters on HCCI diesel emissions, particularly NOx and soot, are also investigated. For each of these parameters, the theories are discussed in conjunction with comparative evaluation of studies reported in the specialised literature.

5000|$|Born in Preston, Lancashire, Kerrigan {{started his}} cricket {{as a junior}} at Palace Shield Premiership club Fulwood & Broughton {{before moving on to}} Ormskirk in the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition. He {{received}} his first contract with Lancashire in September 2008 along with ten other young cricketers. In 2009, Kerrigan broke into Lancashire's second team which progressed to the final of the Second XI Championship and the semi-final of the Second XI Trophy. Gary Keedy, Lancashire's experienced and established spinner, suffered a broken collar bone in April 2010, immediately {{before the start of the}} English cricket season. With several months on the sidelines, Keedy's absence gave the opportunity to young spinners Kerrigan and Stephen Parry to play first team cricket. Lancashire coach Peter Moores said [...] "We’re lucky in some ways in that we’ve got Stephen Parry, who played quite a lot of first-team cricket last season, but we’ve also got Simon Kerrigan, who bowled beautifully to take six wickets in the pre-season game against Yorkshire in Barbados and we could also use Steven Crofty's off-spin". Kerrigan made his first-class debut in Lancashire's first match of the season taking his maiden five wicket haul and finishing with seven wickets in the match to help Lancashire to victory over Warwickshire. His maiden wicket was that of England cricketer Ian Bell. Kerrigan played 13 first-class matches in his first full season with Lancashire, taking 30 wickets at an average of 32.23 including three five-wicket hauls. When Keedy returned from injury he and Kerrigan sometimes bowled together in the County Championship. However, their partnership was not initially ideal as they were attempting to out perform each other.

25|$|Larger {{machines}} printing {{from two}} to sixteen colours are precisely similar in principle to the above, but differ somewhat in detail and are naturally more complex and difficult to operate. In a twelve-colour machine, for example, twelve copper rollers, each carrying one portion of the design, are arranged round a central <b>pressure</b> cylinder, or <b>bowl,</b> common to all, and each roller is driven by a common driving wheel, called the crown wheel, actuated, in most cases, by its own steam-engine or motor. Another {{difference is that the}} adjustment of pressure is transferred from the cylinder to the rollers which works in specially constructed bearings capable of the following movements: (1) Of being screwed up bodily until the rollers are lightly pressed against the central bowl; (2) of being moved to and fro sideways so that the rollers may he laterally adjusted; and (3) of being moved up or down for the purpose of adjusting the rollers in vertical direction. Notwithstanding the great latitude of movement thus provided each roller is furnished with a box-wheel, which serves the double purpose of connecting or gearing it to the driving wheel, and of affording a fine adjustment. Each roller is further furnished with its own colour-box and doctors.|$|R
