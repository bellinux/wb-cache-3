5|$|Archaeamphora longicervia H. Q. Li was {{described}} as an herbaceous, Sarraceniaceae-like pitcher plant from the mid Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of Liaoning Province, northeastern China. Here, a re-investigation of A. longicervia specimens from the Yixian Formation provides new insights into its identity and the morphology of <b>pitcher</b> <b>plants</b> claimed by Li. We demonstrate that putative pitchers of Archaeamphora are insect-induced leaf galls that consist of three components: (1) an innermost larval chamber; (2) an intermediate zone of nutritive tissue; and (3) an outermost wall of sclerenchyma. Archaeamphora is not a carnivorous, Sarraceniaceae-like angiosperm, but represents insect-galled leaves of the previously reported gymnosperm Liaoningocladus boii G. Sun et al. from the Yixian Formation.|$|E

He attributes the reason to having a ceiling that effectively trapped the moths; in other houses the moths at once escaped into the roof, and he recommends naturalists to bring a verandah-shaped tent to enable them to catch moths.|$|E

Most species catch insects, although the larger ones, such as Nepenthes rajah, also occasionally take small mammals and reptiles. Nepenthes bicalcarata possesses two sharp thorns that project from the base of the operculum over the entrance to the pitcher. These likely serve to lure insects into a precarious position over the pitcher mouth, where they may lose their footing and fall into the fluid within.|$|E

25|$|The green pitcher {{plant has}} {{suffered}} a devastating decline throughout its former range. Development for both urban and rural uses {{has led to the}} widespread alteration of the specific bog habitat of this species. <b>Pitcher</b> <b>plants</b> have also been over-collected for the commercial plant trade; such rare and unusual species are very popular with collectors.

25|$|A passive trap, pitfall traps attract prey with nectar bribes {{secreted}} by the peristome {{and bright}} flower-like anthocyanin patterning within the pitcher. The linings of most <b>pitcher</b> <b>plants</b> {{are covered in}} a loose coating of waxy flakes which are slippery for insects, causing them {{to fall into the}} pitcher. Once within the pitcher structure, digestive enzymes or mutualistic species break down the prey into an absorbable form for the plant. Water can become trapped within the pitcher, making a habitat for other flora and fauna. This type of 'water body' is called a Phytotelma.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} <b>pitcher</b> <b>plants</b> {{are probably}} those of Heliamphora, the marsh pitcher plant. In this genus, the traps are clearly {{derived from a}} simple rolled leaf whose margins have sealed together. These plants live in areas of high rainfall in South America such as Mount Roraima and consequently have a problem ensuring their pitchers do not overflow. To counteract this problem, natural selection has favoured the evolution of an overflow {{similar to that of}} a bathroom sink—a small gap in the zipped-up leaf margins allows excess water to flow out of the pitcher.|$|E
