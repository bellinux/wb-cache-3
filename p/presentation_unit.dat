The main objective of our study was to evaluate a new near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy sample <b>presentation</b> <b>unit</b> for measuring feed quality of maize stover. In this context, we investigated the effect of engineering factors (use of glass interface and packing pressure) on the spectral repeatability {{and the effect of}} particle sizes (8 cm, 6 cm, 4 cm, 0. 5 cm) on the calibration performance. The spectral repeatability was examined by calculating spectral variation among replicated spectral measurements collected without glass interface, with glass interface, and glass interface in combination with 3 kg and 6 kg of packing pressure. The effect of particle sizes was assessed for concentrations of nitrogen (N), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), ash and in vitro fermentability (G 24), by examining calibration models. The spectral repeatability increased with the use of glass interface and packing pressure and calibration performance improved with a reduction in particle size.

The scheme or agency employs static and mobile agents for the following purpose: to estimate the network delays in real-time based on sustainable stream loss, to compute the skew, to monitor the loss and estimate the playout times of the <b>presentation</b> <b>units.</b> We have experimentally evaluated the scheme by using IBM Aglets and verified its functioning in terms of synchronization loss and mean buffering delays.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} the {{coupling}} of V-STORM, which is both a video manager and a multimedia presentation system, with AROM, an object-based knowledge representation system. We first present here an AROM knowledge base, called the AVS model, which constitutes a generic model for multimedia presentations. The resulting model encompasses any multimedia presentation described using the SMIL standard. By instantiating this knowledge base, the author describes her/his multimedia presentation and the way media objects interact in it. Then, the corresponding SMIL file is exhibited and sent to V-STORM {{in order to be}} played. This coupling shows to be relevant for two reasons: first, by its UML-like formalism, AROM eases the task of a multimedia presentation author; second, AROM is put in charge of checking the spatial and temporal consistencies of the presentation during its description. This way, a consistent presentation is sent to V-STORM. Lastly, we present another AROM model which describes the notion of template, a logical <b>presentation</b> <b>unit</b> which merges database queries with spatio-temporal constraints...|$|E

How can we effectively educate {{students about the}} nuances of delivering effective presentations? As part of an on-going assessment project of departmental strategic goals, Toth and Schendel investigated how well students effectively delivered presentations, since our major {{does not require a}} speech course. A departmental goal is that students will develop the ability to write well by analyzing and understanding rhetorical situations and by learning to respond to particular situations with appropriate kinds of discourse. While we believe students are capable of responding to particular communication situations appropriately within their writing, we investigated if they could transfer their abilities to a different mode of communication: oral presentations. Specifically, we assessed how students enrolled in Writing 200 could demonstrate effective speaking strategies, use visuals to enhance delivery, and shift the content/organization from a written assignment which addressed an external audience to an internal audience for the presentation. We normed our teaching practices for the <b>presentation</b> <b>unit</b> and collaborated on a rubric that we used to assess the presentations.

A total of 194 hog manures, which were collected in the spring of 2004 from farms {{in the northern part of}} Belgium, were assayed by conventional wet chemical analysis and spectroscopy for the following constituents: dry matter content (DM), organic matter content (OM), pH, total Kjeldahl nitrogen (Ntot), ammonium nitrogen (NH 4 -N), phosphorus (P), potash (K), calcium (Ca), sodium (Na) and magnesium (Mg). Samples were scanned with a Foss NIRSystems Model 6500 scanning monochromator in reflectance and transflectance mode, respectively. A ceramic reference was measured in between the two modes. The monochromator was equipped with a DCFA sample <b>presentation</b> <b>unit</b> and ranges from 400 to 2498 nm. Partial least squares regression was employed to relate the spectral information to the nutrient content. The PLS models were calibrated for both sample presentation modes using leave-one-out cross-validation.

From the transflectance measurements, very good quantitative predictions for total N, good quantitative predictions for K, DM and OM, approximate predictions for NH 4 -N, P and Mg, very approximate predictions for Ca and a discrimination between high and low values for Na were obtained. pH was not predictable. The reflectance measurements were able to provide good quantitative predictions for total N and K, approximate quantitative predictions for NH 4 -N, very approximate predictions for DM, OM, P and Mg and discrimination between high and low values for Ca.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} Government {{media policy}} throughout the Falklands War of 1982. It considers the effectiveness, and charts the development of, Falklands-related public relations’ policy by departments including, {{but not limited}} to, the Ministry of Defence (MoD). The literature of the 1980 s concerning the media during the conflict still dominates the historiography of the subject. This thesis is the first significant reappraisal of the work offered during the decade in which the war occurred. It is informed by recently released archive material and newly conducted interviews, and boasts an extensive analysis {{of the content of}} the printed press during the conflict. There are a number of central hypotheses contained in this research (as well as many lesser theories). This thesis argues that media policy observed by the MoD in relation to the Task Force journalists was ill-prepared, reactionary, driven by internal MoD motivation and that ultimately, control of policy was devolved to the men on the ground. This thesis advances that MoD media policy in Britain, while as reactive as that rolled out to the Task Force, became more effective as the war progressed. The MoD failed to adequately cater for the British media until the middle of May 1982, at which time a number of sensible and potentially successful initiatives were introduced – specifically the News Release Group and the Military Briefing Group. It is also the contention of this work that the machinery developed centrally, by the Cabinet Office and No. 10 Press Office {{in the form of the}} South Atlantic <b>Presentation</b> <b>Unit</b> and Information Group, had the potential to be successful additions to the regular organisation of Government. However, neither had enough authority and were plagued by departmental rivalries. While the media-related initiatives of the MoD ultimately became more successful, those of wider Government became less effective. Finally, this thesis provides a serious analysis of the printed press in order to substantiate the hypothesis that much of what had been argued about the printed press was generalised and oversimplified – its reliance on Argentine source material, its jingoistic nature, the dominance of reports on armed conflict and its aversion to a diplomatic settlement...|$|E
