As a result, many {{systems have been}} proposed to reduce their impact and population spread, {{each of which has}} its limitations. Lure and kill systems are extensively used to combat medfy infestations. However, widely used bait spray applications indiscriminately contaminate the target area with insecticide, having harmful effects on beneficial and other non-target organisms. Alternative systems rely on traps that lure flies in where they are killed, these require regular maintenance and rely on either a single sex attractant (which only have limited effect on the female population) or the use broad spectrum attractants that attract and kill beneficial, pest controlling, insects. This work allows the development of a lure and kill control strategy based on insecticide formulated electrostatic powders that can be autodisseminated through a pest population. Laboratory survival experiments were used to compare the LT 50 s of two insecticides (chlorpyrifos and spinosad) formulated with different powders (EntostatTM and Entomag™) and to show secondary transfer of insecticide from contaminated males to females through courtship. The combination of EntostatTM powder and 2 % spinosad gave the best performance allowing sufficient time for transfer between conspecifics before mortality and rapid mortality to secondary contaminated females.

Lowering the work function value or increasing the γ-/γ+ ratio of the container material resulted in mannitol being more negatively charged, and vice versa.

Development of an automated wet chemistry preparation system that can operate autonomously on Earth and is also designed to operate under Martian ambient conditions will demonstrate the technical feasibility of including wet chemistry on future missions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} storage on the {{efficacy}} of powders from Eugenia aromatica (Baill.) of different ages in the control of Callosobruchus maculatus (Fabricius), a major pest of stored cowpea seeds, were investigated in the laboratory. Powders stored for periods of < 1 month, 24, 36 and 48 months with particle size of 300 µm were tested. Contact toxicity was tested for the differently aged powders at 0. 4 g of material per 20 g of seed in separate plastic Petri plates. In fumigant toxicity tests 20 g of infested cowpea seeds was suspended {{in a piece of}} muslin cloth, over 0. 4 g of <b>powder</b> in a <b>container.</b> In the contact toxicity tests, all the differently aged powders killed C. maculatus adult within 48 hours. The differently aged powders significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced oviposition by the introduced C. maculatus adults and adults did not emerge from eggs laid. In the fumigant toxicity test, first use of the differently aged powders prevented emergence of adult C. maculatus from fumigated eggs. In a consecutive reuse of powders, adults emerged from fumigated eggs but the numbers were significantly (P < 0. 05) fewer than in the control.

The inhaled fine particles can deposit on respiratory tracts and lungs, causing asthma, lung cancer, and other acute respiratory illnesses and chronic symptoms. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a standard procedure to measure the airborne concentrations of different size particles within the vicinity of a dropped container where a significant portion of the contained powder is ejected. Tungsten oxide (WO{sub 3 }) was selected in this study to represent relatively heavy powders (7. 16 g/cm 3 specific gravity for WO{sub 3 }). A typical can with the outer dimensions of 4. 25 ” diameter and 4. 875 ” tall was used as the <b>container.</b> The <b>powder</b> was dropped in two different configurations: 1) contained within a can covered by a lid that has a 0. 25 ” diameter hole, and 2) contained within a can without a lid. The packing volume of the powder was 51. 4 in{sup 3 } (842. 7 cm{sup 3 }) and the target mass was 1936 g. The tests were carried out in a full-scale stainless steel environmental chamber with an interior volume of 852 ft{sup 3 } (24. 1 m{sup 3 }). The chamber system includes an internal recirculation loop with a rectangular air diffuser and 10 variable frequency drive fans to provide a typical room air recirculation flow pattern. Two air filters were installed in the chamber air supply duct and return duct to achieve the required low background particle concentration. The initial chamber air conditions were set at 70 °F (± 5 °F) and 50 % (± 10 %) RH. A supporting frame and releasing device were designed and built to trigger consistently the dropping of the can at a height of 8 feet from the bottom of the can to the impacting surface. The particle sampling inlet was placed 5 ft above the floor and 6 inches laterally away from the can’s falling path. Concentrations of particles between 0. 5 μm and 20 μm were recorded in units of mass and number of particles per unit volume. The data acquisition rate was once every 2 seconds during the first 2 hours and every 20 seconds thereafter. A test procedure was developed and a total of nine drop tests were performed. In most cases (seven tests), the can tipped over after dropping. The can in Test 1 stayed upright. The can in Test 7 showed a special behavior: after the rebound, it turned upside down and stayed upright. Major findings are summarized below:  The amount of spilled powder varied from 0. 12 g to 252. 35 g and the non-recovered powder varied from 0. 11 g to 1. 18 g. The corresponding percentage of the spilled powder ranged from 0. 01 % to 13 %.  The peak value of particle number concentration after the dropping of the can occurred at approximately 0. 9 μm particle size per measured data of individual channels. The peak value of particle mass concentration occurred in the range of 4. 3 - 10 μm particle size per grouped data calculated from the measured data with the exception of Test 4 where a different batch powder with unexpectedly different bulk density and particle size distribution.  After the dropping of the can, the total airborne mass concentrations ranged from 0. 03 to 0. 35 mg/m{sup 3 }, while the total airborne number concentrations ranged from 2 to 125 #/cm{sup 3 } except for Test 4. The number concentration in Test 4 was 1 or 2 orders of magnitude less than those of other tests because the powder was from a different batch. However, its mass concentration was comparable to that in Test 7 because relatively more big airborne particles were detected in Test 4. In general, tests with lid (Test 5, 6, 7 and 8) had smaller concentrations than tests without lid (Test 0, 1, 2, and 3). The influence of lid was not as prominent as the powder (Test 4). However, this needs more tests for verification.  The ratio of airborne mass to non-recovered mass ranged from 0. 1 % to 2 %. This means that it is challenging to use this method to check the mass balance, while the uptake factor and associated inhalation exposure can be readily assessed.  The calculated cumulative uptake mass within first 10 minutes after the dropping of the can for each test was within the range of 0. 002 mg to 0. 035 mg. Assuming a breathing rate of 1. 2 m{sup 3 }/h, the uptake factor during the first 10 minutes was calculated to be between 10 {sup - 9 } and 2 × 10 {sup - 8 } in reference to the amount loaded; or between 10 {sup - 8 } and 6 × 10 {sup - 5 } in reference to the amount spilled.

40|$|The {{detailed}} study of individual lunar soil grains provides evidence that the major optical properties of the lunar surface are primarily related {{to the production of}} fine-grained (< 20 nm, super-paramagnetic) Fe-particles in agglutinitic impact melts and to iron-rich vapor deposits on the surfaces of individual grains. These Fe-rich materials are derived from oxidized species due to high post-shock temperatures in the presence of solar-wind derived H 2; part of the Fe-rich grain surfaces may also be due to sputtering processes. Identical processes were recently suggested for the optical maturation of S-type asteroid surfaces, the parent objects of ordinary chondrites (OCs). OCs, however, do not contain impact-produced soil melts, and should thus also be devoid of impact-triggered vapor condensates. The seeming disparity can only be understood if all OCs resemble relatively immature impact debris, akin to numerous lunar highland breccias. It is possible to assess this scenario by evaluating experimentally whether impact velocities of 5 - 6 km/s, typical for the present day asteroid belt, suffice to produce both impact melts and fine-grained metallic iron. We used 125 - 250 m powders of the L 6 chondrite ALH 85017. These powders were aliquots from fines that were produced by collisionally disrupting a single, large (461 g) chunk of this meteorite during nine impacts and by subjecting the resulting rubble to an additional 50 impacts. As a consequence, the present shock-recovery experiments employ target materials of exceptional fidelity (i. e., a real chondrite that was impact pulverized). The target powders were packed into tungsten-alloy containers to allow for the potential investigation of freshly produced, fine-grained iron and impacted by stainless-steel and tungsten flyer plates; the packing density varied between 38 and 45 % porosity. Peak pressures ranged from 14. 5 to 67 GPa and were attained after multiple reverberations of the shock wave at the interface of the silicate <b>powder</b> and metal <b>container.</b> Pressures in the 50 to 70 GPa range should be fairly typical for asteroid impacts at approx. 5 - 6 km/s, yet we note that these pressures refer to those at the projectile/target interface only and that most crater ejecta on OC parent-bodies will have experienced much lower stresses...|$|R

Only in recent years, however, have science and medicine been applied to aviculture and pet care. Pigeon racing is one of the sports not well known to the general public. These sportsmen invest a great deal to ensure that their pigeons are disease free. During racing they are exposed to infectious agents in the racing baskets and bring these pathogens back to the racing flock. If you ask any experienced flier what health problem he fears most for his pigeons during the racing season, he will probably say respiratory infection. Respiratory diseases are very common in pigeons. They are the major cause of poor performance and pigeon loss during the racing season. Doxycyline HCI, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, is the world-wide veterinary therapeutic agent of choice {{for the treatment of}} Chlamydia, a principle cause of respiratory infection. Doxycyline HCI has several advantages: greater activity, providing effective blood levels for up to 20 hours after a single dose compared to 4 hours for older tetracyclines; causes less disruption to the normal bowel bacteria; has less detrimental effect on the immune system; and is less affected by calcium and other minerals. Bromhexine HCI is an expectorant drug, promoting bronchial secretion and having mucolytic properties. It is commonly used in combination with antibiotics such as doxycycline HCI for the treatment of respiratory infections in the pigeon loft. Because avian medicine has not been commercialised as much as those for human use, it has left fanciers experimenting with dosage forms and strengths resulting in severe consequences. There is a great need for sophisticated medication developed specifically for the pigeon market. Methods: This study investigated the formulation of a direct compressed tablet and a water-soluble powder containing doxycycline HCI and bromhexine HCI respectively and in combination. The formulation and evaluation of the stability of an ophthalmic solution, containing doxycycline HCI was also investigated. Initial test were done on all three formulations. The tablets were inspected visually and tested for uniformity of mass, hardness, friability, disintegration, assay and dissolution. The water-soluble powder was tested for its pH, constitution time, assay, moisture content and visual properties. An "in use" assay was also done on the doxycycline HCI <b>powder.</b> Three <b>containers</b> (stainless steel, glass and plastic) were used and the powder was dissolved in tap water (5 mglml). Samples were taken from every container after 0, 6, 12 and 24 hours and analysed. The results obtained were compared to the same powder but with no citric acid in the formulation. The same containers and time intervals were used for the comparing powder. The ophthalmic solution's appearance, pH, density, viscosity, assay, particulate matter and preservative efficacy were tested. The formulations were stored at three different temperatures and humidities for three months. The above mentioned tests were repeated after every month. An HPLC method for the simultaneous determination of doxycycline HCI and bromhexine HCI was developed and validated. Results and discussion: Based on the different test results generated over the twelve weeks of stability evaluation of the products that were developed in this study, doxycycline HCI and bromhexine HCI, respectively and in combination, seemed to have been relatively stable. The final tablets, water-soluble powders and ophthalmic solution formulations remained stable. The "in use" assay of the powder containing citric acid showed no discoloration, precipitation or breakdown when dissolved in water for a period of 24 hours. The powder lacking the citric acid showed discoloration after only 3 hours. This powder showed significant breakdown as well. The containers used for the storage of the tablets and the powders didn't seal tight enough. The moisture uptake was very high resulting in poor disintegration and dissolution times. Therefore the powder and the tablets should be stored in tightly sealed containers with enough silica as drying agent. The containers used for the tablets, powders and ophthalmic solution respectively, seemed not to influence the stability of the formulations negatively. The newly developed and validated HPLC method was used to analyse the stability samples and it proved to be reliable and easy to execute. Conclusion: Accelerated stability tests indicated that the formulations remained stable and that no significant breakdown occurred. Complete stability trial studies should however be conducted to claim their stability. The newly developed HPLC method was used over the twelve-week period to analyse accelerated stability samples, and it proved to be reliable and easy to carry out. Master...|$|R
