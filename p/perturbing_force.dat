Most Keplerian {{problems}} {{were treated as}} ideal or under the basic assumptions that the motion of a body in the orbits {{is a result of}} the gravitational attraction between two bodies. This ideal situation does not exist. Additional forces acting on any moving body must be taken into account. These additional forces are called the <b>perturbing</b> <b>forces.</b> The <b>perturbing</b> <b>forces</b> that cause the satellite orbit to deviate from a theoretically regular orbital motion can be divided into two categories, conservative field <b>forces</b> and non-conservative <b>perturbing</b> <b>forces.</b> The conservative <b>perturbing</b> <b>forces</b> are due to other celestial bodies such as Moon, Sun and etc. Solar pressure, atmospheric drag, thrust and the non-homogeneity and oblateness of the Earth are the examples of the non-conservative <b>perturbing</b> <b>forces.</b> This paper discusses the study of perturbation of a satellite orbit due to the presence of other gravitational bodies such as Moon and Sun from the conservative <b>perturbing</b> <b>forces</b> and from the non-conservative <b>perturbing</b> <b>forces</b> such as the non-homogeneity and oblateness of the Earth, atmospheric drag and thrust.

50|$|The complex {{motions of}} orbits {{can be broken}} down. The {{hypothetical}} motion that the body follows under the gravitational effect of one other body only is typically a conic section, and can be readily modeled with the methods of geometry. This is called a two-body problem, or an unperturbed Keplerian orbit. The differences between the Keplerian orbit and the actual motion of the body are caused by perturbations. These perturbations are caused by forces other than the gravitational effect between the primary and secondary body and must be modeled to create an accurate orbit simulation. Most orbit modeling approaches model the two-body problem and then add models of these <b>perturbing</b> <b>forces</b> and simulate these models over time. <b>Perturbing</b> <b>forces</b> may include gravitational attraction from other bodies besides the primary, solar wind, drag, magnetic fields, and propulsive forces.|$|R

In a second experiment, stiffness changes were measured during adaptation to a visual perturbing environment that magnified hand-path deviations in the lateral direction.
