The 50 % protective dose (PD 50), expressed as capsular polysaccharide content, was 2 ng for cell surface preparations and 50 ng for <b>purified</b> <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharide.</b> Both preparations lost their immunoprotective activity after alkali treatment. Immune sera {{were raised in}} rabbits immunized with cell surface preparations. The precipitating and hemagglutinating capacity of these antisera was tested against either <b>purified</b> <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> or alkali-treated capsular polysaccharide. No difference was observed between the re{{activity of}} the antisera against each antigen. The protective activity of these sera was tested on mice in passive transfer experiments, before and after absorption with either <b>purified</b> <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> or alkali-treated capsular polysaccharide. The sera lost their protective activity after absorption with <b>purified</b> <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> and after absorption with alkali-treated capsular polysaccharide. These experiments show that the difference in immunoprotective activity of cell surface preparations, <b>purified</b> <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharide,</b> and alkali-treated capsular polysaccharide is not due to {{a difference in their}} antigenic determinants. Cell surface preparations and <b>purified</b> <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> were fractionated by gel filtration on Sepharose 4 B and by ultracentrifugation on cesium chloride density gradients. Three forms of capsular polysaccharide have been characterized. (i) A form of capsular polysaccharide with a very high protective activity (PD 50 = 2 ng) that copurified with protein and lipopolysaccharide and was characterized by a low coefficient of distribution (Kd = 0. 20) and a low density (1. 5 to 1. 6 g/cm 3). (ii) A form of capsular polysaccharide with an intermediate protective activity (PD 50 = 50 ng), contamined by less than 3 % protein and 1 % lipopolysaccharide, with a Kd of 0. 35, and a density of 1. 7 to 1. 8 g/cm 3. (iii) A nonimmunoprotective capsular polysaccharide obtained after alkali treatment of either cell surface preparations or <b>purified</b> <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharide.</b> The Kd of these fractions varied from 0. 20 to 0. 90 and their density from 1. 7 to 1. 8 g/cm 3...|$|E

40|$|The {{regulation}} by Cryptococcus neoformans encapsulation of interleukin 1 b (IL- 1 b) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) {{production by}} human monocytes was investigated. By using encapsulated and acapsular C. neoformans, we demonstrated that both strains induce cytokine production, although the acapsular strain {{was a better}} stimulator than the thinly encapsulated strain. The cytokine levels produced by cells stimulated by the two strains were lower and followed a different kinetic than those stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). <b>Purified</b> <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> inhibits TNF-a secretion induced by LPS or acapsular C. neoformans.

40|$|Serum anticapsular {{polysaccharide}} antibodies confer {{immunity to}} invasive diseases caused by Haemophdus influenzae type b (HIB) t (1 - 10). These anti-type b antibodies exert their protective effect by initiating complement-mediated activities including opsonization and bacterial lysis (2 - 5, 11). A protective level of ~ 0. 15 #g of anti-type b antibodies/ml serum was estimated based upon analyses {{of patients with}} X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia who were passively immunized with immunoglobulin and on analyses of vaccinees injected with the <b>purified</b> HIB <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> (HIB Ps) (6 - 8, 11 - 13).

40|$|The {{polysaccharide}} capsule of Klebsiella pneumoniae {{is an important}} virulence factor that confers resistance to phagocytosis. The treatment of encapsulated bacteria with salicylate to inhibit capsule expression was found to enhance the phagocytosis of encapsulated bacteria by human neutrophils only {{in the presence of}} cell surface-specific antibodies. Both type-specific rabbit antisera and anticapsular human hyperimmune globulin were employed as opsonins. Salicylate significantly enhanced phagocytosis with homologous, but not heterologous, whole-cell antisera. Antisera, diluted 1 : 40, no longer opsonized fully encapsulated bacteria but promoted the uptake of multiple salicylate-treated bacteria in > 90 % of neutrophils. Salicylate (0. 25 to 1. 0 mM) also enhanced opsonization with globulin against homologous bacteria. Higher salicylate levels (1 to 2. 5 mM) enhanced the opsonization of heterologous serotypes with human globulin. The nature of antibody attachment to encapsulated bacteria was determined by immunofluorescence. Even after the addition of <b>purified</b> <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> to prevent phagocytosis, K-specific antibodies attached in large amounts to bacteria. K-specific antibodies reacted with antigens throughout the capsule and showed a predilection for a denser inner layer of the capsule, indicating that many of the K-specific antibodies may be masked underneath the capsule surface. K-specific antibodies can also be rendered nonfunctional by soluble, cell-free capsular antigen. In culture, large quantities of soluble capsular polysaccharide extrude from bacteria after overnight growth. The reduction in capsule expression caused by salicylate largely affected the soluble, cell-free fraction. <b>Purified</b> <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> was shown to retard the opsonophagocytosis of salicylate-treated bacteria in a concentration-dependent manner. However, extensive washing of encapsulated bacteria to remove loosely attached capsular material did not significantly enhance opsonophagocytosis.

Salicylate-mediated inhibition of capsule expression, particularly of the cell-free fraction, improved K-specific opsonization dramatically...|$|E

40|$|Cell surface {{preparations}} and ribosomal preparations were {{extracted from}} Klebsiella pneumoniae. Agar gel diffusion with antisera to cell surface preparations or ribosomal preparations indicated common antigenic components among the preparations.

These results and the previous identification of lipopolysaccharide and <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> in ribosomal preparations suggest that these antigens {{are responsible for the}} immunochemical cross-reactivity observed among these two bacterial extracts. Active protection could be induced in mice by these two preparations. On a dry-weight basis, cell surface preparations provided better immunoprotective activity than did ribosomal preparations. However, the 50 % protective dose of both preparations is practically the same {{on the basis of their}} <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> content. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the immunoprotective moiety of ribosomal preparations is the contaminating cell surface antigens.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which immune unresponsiveness (immune paralysis) develops are still uncertain. The present work {{was based on the}} assumption that this condition may be due to failure of certain activities of the macrophages. Data from passive transfer of such cells are interpreted as supporting this hypothesis. <b>Purified</b> <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> from type 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae induced immunity when given to Swiss albino mice in 5 -μg amounts and immune paralysis when given in 1, 000 -μg amounts. The unresponsive state lapsed to that of acquired immunity 3 months after induction. Passive transfer of cells from groups of K. pneumoniae immune, “paralyzed,” and control mice showed that peritoneal cells from “paralyzed” donors induced significant protection against challenge in both control and “paralyzed” recipients. In contrast, spleen cells from control, “paralyzed,” and immune animals failed to effect such transfer. The finding that unresponsiveness could be terminated by peritoneal cells and not spleen cells indicates that macrophages played a primary role in immune paralysis, possibly owing to their loss of capacity to transfer factors or information for induction of antibody synthesis...|$|E

LA was positive in six cases of pneumonia where CIE was negative; however, in three of these cases, antigen was detected only in undiluted sera, which raised some question about the specificity of the result. With 18 samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 11 patients with pneumococcal meningitis, the CIE test was positive more frequenlty (14 samples) than was LA (11 samples). Moreover, antigen was detected in CSF by LA in only one additional patient than was positive by CIE alone.

40|$|Thesis (Masters Diploma(Technology)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 2000 Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) {{infections are}} an {{important}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in adults and children worldwide. Mortality rates are highest amongst the very young and the elderly. Streptococcus pneumoniae is {{the most common form of}} community acquired bacterial pneumonia. Other diseases commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae include meningitis, pericarditis, bacteraemia and septicaemia. Penicillin is today still consid 3 red the drug of choice when treating pneumococcal infections. The emergence of resistant pneumococcal strains has made it necessary to adapt antimicrobial regimens when treating pneumococcal infections. Hansman (1967) reported the first penicillin resistant strain, which was isolated from a woman in Australia in 1967. Since then penicillin and multi-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains have been observed worldwide, including South Africa. Streptococcus pneumoniae infections may be caused by anyone of the 84 serotypes recognized to date. The distribution of serotypes varies, depending on geographical area, age and site of infection. High-level penicillin resistance and multiple resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains have been recognised worldwide in a few pneumococcal serotypes. Pneumococcal vaccines have been used since the seventies. These <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> vaccines are generally recommended for at risk population such as the elderly and immunocompromised patients. This vaccine is not effective in children under 2 years old.

KK 207 - 1 was always less efficient compared to KKBO- 1 in: a) inducing NLRP 3 and pro-IL- 1 β gene and protein expression; b) in inducing caspase- 1 activation and pro-IL- 1 β cleavage. Capsular composition {{may play a role in}} the differential inflammatory response induced by the ST 258 -KP strains since <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> <b>purified</b> from bacterial cells affect NLRP 3 and pro-IL- 1 β gene expression through p 38 MAPK- and NF-κB-mediated pathways. In each of these functions, <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> from KK 207 - 1 were significantly less efficient compared to those purified from KKBO- 1. On the whole, our data suggest that the change in capsular phenotype may help bacterial cells of clade I to partially escape innate immune recognition and IL- 1 β-mediated inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Complement {{activation}} with pneumococcal antigens was studied both {{in vitro}} and after injection of the antigens into rats. Whole pneumococci of various serotypes activated C 3 -C 9 in rat serum treated with ethyleneglycol-bis (β-aminoethyl ether) -N,N′-tetraacetic acid, although serotypes differed greatly {{in the extent}} of activation. Some <b>purified</b> pneumococcal <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> also activated C 3 -C 9 in rat serum, but only when the antigens were present in concentrations of 500 to 1, 000 μg/ml. Much of the activation with <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> was eliminated {{by the use of}} ethyleneglycol-bis (β-aminoethyl ether) -N,N′-tetraacetic acid. Activation of C 3 -C 9 by <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> did not correlate with the level of reactivity observed with whole organisms of the same serotypes. After injection of 5 × 109 pneumococci (type 3 or type 4) intravenously into rats, there was a transient decline in serum C 3 -C 9 activity, but there was no decline in C 3 -C 9 levels after intravenous injection of 1, 000 μg of type 3 or type 4 <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharides.</b> As determined by immunofluorescence, circulating <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> was deposited in several tissues, including the vascular endothelium and glomerular mesangium of the kidney. C 3 was not detectable in these deposits, and there was no histological evidence of an inflammatory response. <b>Capsular</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> appear to be only weak activators of complement. Other pneumococcal antigens may be more important in the pathogenesis of hypocomplementemia in pneumococcal infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} the {{encapsulated}} species Bacteroides fragilis to adhere to rat peritoneal mesothelium was compared to the adherence of unecapsulated strains of Bacteroides (B. distasonis, B. vulgatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. ovatus, and B. "other"). Adherence was assayed by attaching plexiglas plates containing 8 -mm holes to the peritoneal mesothelium of anesthetized rats. Cell suspension (0. 25 ml) was incubated in each well, after which the suspension was aspirated, and a 4 -mm punch biopsy was removed. Viable organisms adhering to the biopsy specimen were enumerated by plate count following washing of the biopsy tissue. It was found that B. fragilis adhered significantly better to mesothelial tissue (10 (3. 00) colony-forming units per biopsy) than unencapsulated species of Bacteroides (10 (1. 07) colony-forming units per biopsy). This effect was not due to differential oxygen sensitivity of the various inocula. Immunization of rats with capsular polysaccharide did not demonstrate decrease in the adherence of B. fragilis; however, preincubation of the mesothelium with <b>purified</b> <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> resulted in a substantial reduction in adherence. These results indicate that B. fragilis adheres to rat peritoneal mesothelium better than unencapsulated species and suggests that the capsular polysaccharide of B. fragilis plays some role in this increased adherence...|$|E
40|$|A serotype-specific tube latex {{agglutination}} assay for 10 pneumococcal serotypes was evaluated {{with use of}} urine samples from 72 Kenyan adults with pneumonia whose blood or lung aspirate cultures were positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 203 patients with pneumonia whose cultures were negative for S. pneumoniae, and 101 afebrile controls. Detection thresholds for <b>purified</b> <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> in normal urine ranged from 0. 33 to 10 ng/mL. The sensitivity of the assay for the 10 pneumococcal serotypes was 0. 57 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 44 – 0. 70) and was unaffected by human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity, prior antibiotic use, and bacteremic or nonbacteremic status but varied significantly by serotype. Of the pneumococci obtained by culture, 81 % were of serotypes (1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 19, and 22) that {{were included in the}} antigen assay. Strong simultaneous agglutinations against two different serotypes were found in urine samples from two patients. The specificity of the assay was 0. 98 (lower 95 % confidence limit, 0. 95). Subjective reading of agglutination results introduced variation in specificity that may be inapparent if not formally measured. The assay extended the diagnostic yield in pneumococcal pneumonia by a factor of 2. 2 (from 54 diagnoses established by blood culture to 119 established by both methods) and may therefore prove useful in reducing the sample size of epidemiological studies of pneumococca...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPneumococcal infections, {{including}} {{pneumonia and}} invasive disease, are {{major sources of}} morbidity and mortality worldwide. Prevention of the first acquisition of Streptococcus pneumoniae through the use of vaccines represents an effective method to reduce the burden of the disease in both children and adults. Two vaccines are currently available in adults: a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV 23) that includes 23 <b>purified</b> <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> antigens and a pneumococcal protein-conjugate vaccine (PCV 13) that includes capsular polysaccharide antigens covalently linked to a non-toxic protein. The PPV 23 induces a humoral immune response and since it has been licensed {{has been the subject of}} debates and controversies. Numerous studies and meta-analyses have shown that PPV 23 protects against invasive pneumococcal disease, although there are conflicting data regarding its efficacy for the prevention of pneumonia. Vaccination with PCV 13 stimulates good antibody responses as well as mucosal immunity and suppresses colonization. A conjugate vaccine can be expected to have benefits over a polysaccharide vaccine because of the characteristics of a T-cell-dependent response in terms of affinity, maturation of antibodies with repeated exposure, induction of immunological memory and long-lasting immunity. PCV 13 has demonstrated all of these characteristics in children and fundamental differences in adults are not expected. The efficacy in adults is currently being investigated and results will be available soon...|$|E
50|$|Vaccines rely on immune {{modulation}} or augmentation. Vaccination either excites or {{reinforces the}} immune competence {{of a host}} to ward off infection, leading to the activation of macrophages, the production of antibodies, inflammation, and other classic immune reactions. Antibacterial vaccines {{have been responsible for}} a drastic reduction in global bacterial diseases. Vaccines made from attenuated whole cells or lysates have been replaced largely by less reactogenic, cell-free vaccines consisting of <b>purified</b> components, including <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> and their conjugates, to protein carriers, as well as inactivated toxins (toxoids) and proteins.|$|R
40|$|Pneumovax 23 {{consists}} of a mixture of highly <b>purified</b> <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> (Ps) from 23 of the most prevalent serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Testing of vaccine immunogenicity has been historically performed on the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) platform, validated to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to all 23 serotypes included in Pneumovax 23. In order to significantly improve the throughput of this form of testing, we have developed and validated a direct binding electrochemiluminescence (ECL) -based multiplex assay that can measure the antibody response in human serum to eight serotypes within a single microtiter well. The pneumococcal (Pn) ECL assay {{is based on the}} Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) technology which utilizes a Sulfo-Tag-labeled anti-human IgG antibody that emits light upon electrochemical stimulation. The Pn ECL assay exhibits a wide dynamic range and provides the ability to read concentrations down to the minimum reported concentration in the Merck ELISA (0. 1 μg/ml). Cross-reactivity assessment using type-specific monoclonal antibodies showed no cross talk between antigen spots within a well. By use of the WHO Pn sample reference panel, the results obtained with the Pn ECL assay were compared to the results obtained with the international Pn ELISA. The results for the Pn ECL assay satisfied the WHO-recommended acceptance criterion for concordance for all seven serotypes with published Pn ELISA values, and the overall correlation (r value) across the seven serotypes was 0. 994. The MSD methodology has great potential to be extremely useful for simultaneously quantitating IgG responses to several Pn serotypes while conserving serum volumes and laboratory testing time...|$|R

His Lasker award was for the development and clear demonstration of the efficacy of a <b>purified</b> vaccine of <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> {{in the prevention of}} pneumococcal disease. Prior to the Austrian polysaccharide vaccine scientists had prepared simpler whole bacteria and <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> vaccines but they were not accepted as standard of care by the medical community. Several medical authorities touted this era as “the end of infectious diseases” due to the remarkable mortality benefits derived from new antimicrobials and anti-parasitics and vaccine research was not thought to be worthwhile.|$|R
