Any flow of fluid or gas is turbulent in almost every case, while the presence of solid particles reduces the amplitude of <b>pulsation</b> <b>speed</b> in a turbulent flow. The calculation of time or distance of travel of contaminants is based on the coefficient of turbulent diffusion. The coefficient of turbulent diffusion in a turbulent flow is no constant value. MGSU laboratory of hydraulics conducted experimental studies of open streams in a rectangular channel to identify patterns of correlation curves and limitations of applicability of well-known formulas. In furtherance of three main geometric constraints of patterns of correlation curves, turbulent flows can be conditionally divided into three types. Types of correlation functions and shapes of vortices are driven by the distance at which the mixture will spread over the turbulent flow. Therefore, the tasks of the theory of diffusion can be classified depending on the purposes of research.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The applications of robust squirrel-cage induction motors in variable speed inverter drive systems have increased considerably due to the availability of easily controlled semiconductor switching devices. One problem encountered in inverter drives is the non-sinusoidal nature of the supply voltage, which results in increased motor losses and harmful torque <b>pulsations</b> producing undesirable <b>speed</b> oscillations. The latter effects are negligible at high frequency operation, due to the damping effect of the rotor and load inertia. However, torque <b>pulsations</b> and <b>speed</b> ripple may be appreciable at low frequency, wore they may result in abnormal wear of gear-teeth or torsional shaft failure. Hence, in applications where constant or precise speed control is important, eg; machine tool, antenna positioning, traction drives etc., {{it is essential to}} establish a method for determining the magnitudes of these torque <b>pulsations</b> and <b>speed</b> ripple, as a first stage in minimizing or eliminating them. When a voltage source inverter is used in such applications, pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques are usually employed, whereby the quasi square waveshape is modulated so as to minimize or eliminate the low order harmonic voltage components and thereby reduce the torque pulsations. Recent investigations have shown that total elimination of low order components does not produce optimal efficiency or torque <b>pulsations</b> and <b>speed</b> ripple. minimization. This thesis describes new PWM strategies which does not rely on complete elimination of low order harmonics, but on controlling the magnitude and phase of these components to achieve a smooth rotor motion. Initially, a mathematical model for the inverter/induction motor drive was developed, based on numerical integration of the system differential equations. The changing topology of the inverter bridge was simulated using tensor techniques. Then an analytical method, based on harmonic equivalent circuit analysis was proposed for calculating the induction motor pulsating torque components under steady-state operating conditions, in terms of stator and rotor current harmonics. The accuracy of this method was verified by comparing its results with those obtained from the mathematical model developed earlier. This provided an extremely rapid, numerically stable and efficient means for evaluating harmonic current and torque components with balanced non-sinusoidal applied voltages. This method was then used to formulate the torque performance function necessary to determine the new optimal PWM switching strategies. Throughout the work, the predicted performance was extensively validated and supported by practical results obtained from an experimental rig specifically designed to drive the machine under different PWM techniques...|$|R

40|$|Scyphomedusae are {{important}} components in trophic and community structures of marine and estuarine systems worldwide. Behavior likely {{has a significant}} influence on medusa population dynamics and growing evidence points to the disproportionate effect individual behavior has on population responses, yet there are few quantitative studies of medusa behavior and no method for quantifying the behavior of individual pelagic organisms. A numerical model of medusa swimming behavior would be an important tool for assessing its effect on spatial patterns and foraging efficiency. An approach was developed that uses a suite of statistical techniques to quantitatively describe time-dependent changes in behavior of pelagic organisms and tested on the swimming behavior of Aurelia aurita and the foraging behavior of Chrysaora quinquecirrha. An individual-based model of medusa swimming behavior was formulated as a correlated random walk of velocity vectors in three dimensions. Each A. aurita medusa exhibited a unique swimming behavior, including varying swimming bell <b>pulsations,</b> <b>speed,</b> and turning at characteristic frequencies. C. quinquecirrha swam in mostly linear trajectories that alternated between periods of slow and fast swimming while searching for prey, but swam at a constant moderate rate with increased anisotropic turning while feeding. Foraging behavior by medusa groups depended on interindividual and intraindividual variability in medusa behavior, including deterministic changes in swimming pulsation strength and turning. Empirical and model results showed that variability of behavior among medusae and by individual medusae over time are integral components determining the aggregated population response. Medusa foraging behavior appears adapted for patchily distributed prey. Alternating between slow and fast swimming while searching for prey may minimize energy expended while periodically generating prey-entraining currents. Increased turning {{in the presence of}} prey increases the likelihood of remaining in prey patches. Anisotropic turning created vertically spiraling paths, well suited to horizontally compressed prey patches. Model results demonstrated that medusae tend to swim toward and accumulate at the surface, avoid direct contact with the bottom, orient search patterns to long-range stimuli (e. g. gravity) and feeding patterns to local stimuli (e. g. prey contact), and exhibit periodicities of velocity outside prey patches and turning within patches that result from deterministic behavior...|$|R

40|$|Harmonics {{elimination}} Pulse-width modulation (HEPWM) originally {{proposed by}} Patel and Hoft [1], {{is a method}} to eliminate (specific) selected harmonics from the PWM waveform spectra. It {{has been seen as}} a viable alternative to the more widely used sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) method. The technique has been recognized to reduce harmonic losses, radio frequency interference, torque <b>pulsations,</b> <b>speed</b> ripples, etc. The main impetus for using HEPWM is that for a given inverter switching frequency, the incidence of the first non eliminated harmonic is almost double that for SPWM scheme. This results in a far superior pole switching waveform harmonic spectrum. As a result, about 50 % reduction in the inverter switching frequency is achievable. The reduction in the switching frequency contributes to the reduction in the switching losses which is advantageous for high power converter applications. Furthermore, it is possible to obtain a much higher pole switching waveform fundamental amplitude before the minimum pulse-width limit of the inverter is reached. This fact, coupled with the ability to operate in the overmodulation region allows for higher utilization of the DC link voltage. Due to the high quality of the output voltage and current, the ripple in the dc link current is also small. Thus, a reduction {{in the size of the}} dc link filter components is achieved. Despite the above-mentioned prominent advantages there is one particular problem that has prevented the use of HEPWM in many drive and power converter industries, namely the equations to calculate switching angles in a HEPWM scheme are non-linear and transcendental. As a result, they cannot be solved online by a microprocessor. Normally, an off-line numerical technique had to be sought. However such operation requires large computational power and with a large number of possibilities of modulation index, ratio, and the interpolation involved, the memory requirement can be very large. Besides the off-line method suggested in [1], there exist several methods to generate on-line HEPWM waveforms. The most prominent of such work was published by Taufiq et. al. [2]. They derived a set of nontranscendental equations for near-optimal solution using sine-wave approximation approach. Using this scheme, the transcendental equations are “reduced” to a simpler form which permits on-line HEPWM computation using digital methods. Another scheme, based on regular sampled PWM technique was suggested by Bowes [3]. Other works are mostly based on pre-calculated angles which are stored in memory. These are referred to as preprogrammed harmonic elimination method. Reference [4] provides excellent review of this technique. This Chapter proposes a new method of near-optimal harmonics elimination based on quadratic-approximated equations. It is envisaged that the proposed method permits even faster and more efficient on-line, real-time computations using a microprocessor due to the simplicity of the algorithm...|$|R

Such motors not only provide a static driving toque, but develop superimposed continuous torque pulsations. The frequency of these torque <b>pulsations</b> varies with <b>speed,</b> such that typically resonance situations with a torsional natural mode at distinct speed cannot be avoided. Whether such resonance situations can be sustained during extended time periods without endangering the shafts by fatigue depends primarily on the total amount of damping available in the shaft train.

From literature, predictions of impeller damping on a theoretical basis are known, but almost no information about an experimental identification of torsional damping coefficients is available.

In this context, models have been developed, which account for various stellar conditions, reflecting all the evolutionary stages of AGB stars, as well as different metallicities. Moreover, we aim to gain insight {{on the nature of}} dust grains, synthesised by inorganic and metallic clusters with associated structures, energetics, reaction mechanisms, and finally possible formation routes. We model the circumstellar envelopes of AGB stars, covering several C/O ratios below unity and pulsation periods of 100 - 500 days, by employing a chemical-kinetic approach. Periodic shocks, induced by <b>pulsation,</b> with <b>speeds</b> of 10 - 32 km/s enable a non-equilibrium chemistry to take place between 1 and 10 R* above the photosphere. The various models include the well-studied, galactic Mira variables like IK Tau and TX Cam, galactic S-stars, semi-regular variables of type SRa and SRb, as well as Mira stars of lower metallicity in the Magellanic clouds. In addition, we perform quantum-chemical calculations on the Density Functional Theory (DFT) level for several alumina and silicate clusters, in order to obtain structures, electronic properties, and infrared (IR) spectra of the potential dust components. The results for the gas phase agree well with the most recent observational data for IK Tau and VY CMa. Major parent molecules form in the shocked gas under non-equilibrium conditions and include CO, H 2 O, SiO, SiS, SO and SO 2, as well as the unexpected carbon-bearing species HCN, CS and CO 2, and the recently detected phosphorous species PO and PN. In the galactic models, small alumina clusters form and condense efficiently close to the star. In the case of galactic Miras, silicate clusters with forsterite mineralogy form and coalesce around 4 R*.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{seven different}} subjects relevant to semiconductor laser diodes which {{fall in the}} following three categories: Bistability and <b>pulsations,</b> high <b>speed</b> modulation and noise. Bistable semiconductor lasers based on inhomogeneous current injection, achieved with a split contact scheme, were proposed around 20 years ago. However, actual devices showed no or only a small hysteresis {{and they were in}} addition beset by pulsations for reasons not well understood at the time. In this thesis we show that lasers with an optimized design can display bistability with a giant hysteresis. Crucial {{to the understanding of the}} bistable laser is a negative differential resistance across the absorber section, reminiscent of a tunnel diode characteristic. Depending on the electrical biasing circuit this negative differential resistance leads to bistability or light-jumps and self-pulsations. A simple model based on the conventional rate equations explains the observed behavior. Investigation of the switching dynamics of this optoelectronic device reveals a delay time which is critically dependent on the trigger pulse amplitude and which is typically in the order of a few nanoseconds at a power-delay product of 100 pJ. We also investigate the characteristic of this laser coupled to an external optical cavity and we demonstrate that this bistable laser can be used as a self-coupled stylus for optical disk readout. Under a different biasing condition this laser coupled to an external optical cavity can be used to generate ultrashort optical pulses through passive mode locking. Unlike previous mode locking techniques, the method presented here does not rely on absorption introduced by damaging the crystal and is consequently much more reliable. The high speed modulation behavior of semiconductor lasers is investigated theoretically and experimentally. In this thesis we derive the fundamental limits of injection lasers for pulse modulation and small signal modulation. We place emphasis on developing laser structures optimized for high frequency modulation and experiments on such structures show that they can be modulated at frequencies up to 8 GHz. At these frequencies the parasitic elements can no longer be neglected and they are included in the analysis. The noise equivalent circuit of a semiconductor laser diode is derived from the rate equations including Langevin noise sources. This equivalent circuit allows a straightforward calculation of the noise and frequency modulation characteristics of a laser diode combined with electronic components. The field spectrum of injection lasers is observed also experimentally. It is a unique feature of injection lasers that their linewidth is increased through a strong amplitude phase coupling by the factor (1 + [alpha] 2) where [alpha] is the linewidth enhancement factor. A model is developed which shows that the same factor [alpha] enters in the small signal modulation characteristics and a careful measurement of the small signal amplitude and phase modulation at high frequencies enables us to obtain this important factor [alpha] for the first time by a direct measurement...|$|R
40|$|Propelled by {{increased}} global awareness {{and demand for}} clean energy systems, {{there is a growing}} trend in transportation, utility, industrial, and residential applications towards the utilisation of power electronic systems with enhanced power ow controllability and eciency. Examples of power electronics applications include terminal converters in high-voltage direct Current (HVDC) transmission; exible AC transmission systems (FACTS); and converters to interface alternative energy systems such as wind turbines to the grid, variable-speed motor drives in pump systems, vehicular propulsion systems, air-conditioners, and refrigerators. The basic functionality of power electronic components is achieved by switching high voltages and currents. Recent advancements in semiconductor technology have significantly improved the current and voltage handling capabilities and the switching frequencies of power electronic devices. However, this rapid switching of high currents and voltages in turn generates electromagnetic disturbances that could distort the functionality of the power electronic equipment and other devices in the vicinity. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) regulations and functionality requirements impose restrictions on the design of power electronic systems. To design robust power electronic systems, a thorough understanding of the related electromagnetic issues is required. This thesis focuses on the EMC characterisation of power electronic systems and contains two major phases. In the first phase, the high frequency characterisation of air-core reactors was considered. Air-core reactors are typically used in power systems for current limiting, ltering, shunting, and neutral grounding applications. It is of interest to understand the behaviour of air-core reactors in the presence of high frequency signals, especially from switching operations in the power electronic components. Using the partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC) approach, air-core reactor models, helpful in design and electromagnetic analysis, were created. The PEEC models were able to predict the current and voltage distributions and the eventual electromagnetic emissions at different frequencies. The second phase involved the characterisation of electromagnetic emissions from PWM drives using both modeling and measurement. A case study was performed on a prototype hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). Typically, emissions from PWM drives are expected at harmonics of the PWM switching frequency (fc) and harmonics of the fundamental frequency (f 0) of the phase voltages. In this study, it was established that space vector PWM drives generate low-frequency pulsating (LFP) emissions at a frequency of 6 f 0. The switching of voltage vectors generates common mode current spikes {{because of the presence of}} stray capacitances and inductances. The spikes superpose across sector boundaries, forming spikes of double or triple amplitude that constitute the LFP emissions. The amplitudes of these ulsations were shown to be dependent on the drive parameters, such as the load, the speed, and the voltage slew rates. These common mode emissions enhance the emissions at harmonics of the switching frequency, create low-frequency emissions, and when injected into an electric motor, could cause torque <b>pulsations</b> and <b>speed</b> uctuations that may degrade drive functionality. Measurements from an HEV prototype show the LFP emissions, and theoretical models were developed to characterise them.

An analytical method of calculating permanent magnet reluctance torque is developed. The method uses an elementary expression for the magnetic field to obtain the stored energy. This enables an analytical expression for the reluctance torque waveform to be obtained. The method is demonstrated to provide a powerful and fast design tool. The method can be generally applied to reluctance torque problems where the airgap is reasonably smooth. The single phase synchronous permanent magnet motor is used in domestic appliances. It is a motor of very simple construction and high reliability, which is directly connected to an AC mains supply, and runs at synchronous speed. It is becoming increasingly used in preference to the shaded pole induction motor. However, its application is limited by the following characteristics. There is no control over the final direction of rotation, unless a mechanical blocking device is used. There are rotor positions at which only a very small starting torque is available. The characteristic twice electrical frequency torque <b>pulsation</b> yields a <b>speed</b> modulation of the same frequency, which can cause acoustic noise problems. A method of improving torque quality by improving the motor design is proposed to alleviate these limiting characteristics. This is achieved by designing a permanent magnet reluctance torque which cancels out the effect of the backward rotating component of the stator field. In this novel design, the permanent magnet reluctance torque effectively acts as a second balancing phase. An unconventional technique for starting a single phase synchronous permanent magnet motor is demonstrated. This technique uses an inductive reluctance torque, provided by placing a suitably shaped iron lamination on the rotor, to rotate the rotor to a position from which starting can occur...|$|R
