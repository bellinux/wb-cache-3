5|$|The first Curry Moor {{pumping station}} {{was built in}} 1864, to house a steam engine and pump. A cottage for the {{operator}} was built next to {{it at the same}} time. This installation lasted until 1955, when a new pumphouse was constructed to house two diesel pumps. The steam engine was retained for historical reasons, and is located in part of the new building. The diesel pumps were supplemented by an electric <b>pump</b> <b>in</b> 1983, and a programme of refurbishment was carried out in 2008, which included {{the construction of a new}} outfall into the river.|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the needs and}} requirements {{in the development of}} rotary blood pumps, we have to consider the current use and limitations of blood <b>pumps</b> <b>in</b> cardiac surgery. There are 5 different fields of indications for blood <b>pumps</b> <b>in</b> cardiac surgery. First, there is the possibility to use rotary blood <b>pumps</b> <b>in</b> the cardiopulmonary bypass system. Second, miniaturized rotary blood pumps can be used to support beating heart surgery. Third, we expect a growing use of rotary blood <b>pumps</b> <b>in</b> short-term ventricular support. The same applies to the field of chronic cardiac failure and long-term myocardial support. Finally, miniaturized rotary blood pumps can be used to support the ventricle during myocardial infarction. Rotary blood pumps are expected, based on their features, to progress in all these indications. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|The heart {{functions}} as a <b>pump</b> <b>in</b> the circulatory system to provide a continuous flow of blood throughout the body. This circulation consists of the systemic circulation {{to and from the}} body and the pulmonary circulation to and from the lungs. Blood in the pulmonary circulation exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen in the lungs through the process of respiration. The systemic circulation then transports oxygen to the body and returns carbon dioxide and relatively deoxygenated blood to the heart for transfer to the lungs.|$|E
5|$|Lord Kelvin {{invented the}} heat <b>pump</b> <b>in</b> 1852, and Heinrich Zoelly had {{patented}} {{the idea of}} using it to draw heat from the ground in 1912. But {{it was not until the}} late 1940s that the geothermal heat pump was successfully implemented. The earliest one was probably Robert C. Webber's home-made 2.2kW direct-exchange system, but sources disagree as to the exact timeline of his invention. J. Donald Kroeker designed the first commercial geothermal heat pump to heat the Commonwealth Building (Portland, Oregon) and demonstrated it in 1946. Professor Carl Nielsen of Ohio State University built the first residential open loop version in his home in 1948. The technology became popular in Sweden as a result of the 1973 oil crisis, and has been growing slowly in worldwide acceptance since then. The 1979 development of polybutylene pipe greatly augmented the heat pump’s economic viability.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} experimental work related to decompression {{was conducted by}} Robert Boyle, who subjected experimental animals to reduced ambient pressure by use of a primitive vacuum <b>pump.</b> <b>In</b> the earliest experiments the subjects died from asphyxiation, but in later experiments, signs of what was later to become known as decompression sickness were observed. Later, when technological advances allowed the use of pressurisation of mines and caissons to exclude water ingress, miners were observed to present symptoms of what would become known as caisson disease, the bends, and decompression sickness. Once it was recognized that the symptoms were caused by gas bubbles, and that recompression could relieve the symptoms, further work showed {{that it was possible}} to avoid symptoms by slow decompression, and subsequently various theoretical models have been derived to predict low-risk decompression profiles and treatment of decompression sickness.|$|E

Many of the engine's subsystems, such as the fully automated cooling system, cockpit gauges, and fuel booster pump were electrical, powered by an engine-driven generator supplemented by two independent batteries. The hydraulic system, necessary to operate the retractable undercarriage, tail hook, and flaps, was pressurised to 1,800 psi by an engine-driven pump. If this failed a hand <b>pump</b> <b>in</b> the cockpit could also power these systems, a pneumatic pump was also driven by the engine for the brakes.
