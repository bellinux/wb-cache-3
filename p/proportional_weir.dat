40|$|This paper {{presents}} a practical linear <b>proportional</b> <b>weir</b> of simple geometric {{shape in the}} form of an inverted V-notch or inward trapezium. The flow through this weir, of half-width w and altitude d, for depths above 0. 22 d is proportional to the depth of flow measured above a reference plane situated at 0. 08 d for all heads in the range 0. 22 d<=h<= 0. 94 d, with a maximum percentage deviation of ± 1. 5 from the theoretical discharge. The linear relationship between head and discharge is based on numerical optimization procedures. Nearly 75 % of the depth of inverted V-notch can be used effectively as the measuring range. Experiments with four weirs, with different vertex angles, show excellent agreement with the theory by giving an average coefficient of discharge for each weir varying from 0. 61 – 0. 62...|$|E
40|$|A theorem {{termed the}} Geometrical Continuity Theorem is enunciated and proven. This theorem throws {{light on the}} aspects of the {{continuity}} of the proportional portion with the base weir portion. These two portions constitute the profile of a <b>proportional</b> <b>weir.</b> A weir of this type with circular bottom is designed. The theorem is used to establish the continuity at the junction of the proportional and the base weir portions of this weir. The coordinates of the weir profile are obtained by numerical methods and are furnished in tabular form for ready use by designers. The discharge passing through the weir is a linear function of the head. The verification of the assumed linear discharge-head relation is furnished for one of the three weirs with which experiments were conducted. The coefficient of discharge for this typical weir is found to be a constant with a value of 0. 59...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} work of Keshava Munhy and {{collaborators}} {{in the area of}} <b>proportional</b> <b>weirs.</b> It brings forlh the lacuna that existed in the theory of weirs and focusses on why there was need a for a generalized theory of,,"'(irs. It oullines the theorem of slope discharge continuity developed, emphasizing the importance of a datum or reference plane for every weir. It explains briefly the mathematical theory developed and its application to the design of several imponant weirs having wide application. The theory and application of geometrically simple weirs is briefly outlined...|$|R
40|$|Five {{different}} shaped weirs {{were designed}} and pertinent data {{for their use}} are given. One of these weir shapes had the least “sharp edge” at the junction of the base weir and “complementary weir. ” Two other types of weirs had equal slopes at the junction of the base weir and complementary weir. Another shape, for which neither the indication accuracy was constant nor the slope was equal at the junction of the base weir and complementary weir, was also tested. The results of the four weir shapes hydraulically tested give consistent values for the coefficient of discharge varying between 0. 625 to 0. 631. The indication accuracies of all the previously designed linear <b>proportional</b> <b>weirs</b> (includig Sutro weir) are neither constant nor unity, as is believed. ...|$|R
40|$|Seven {{different}} shaped modified proportional V-notches {{were designed}} and pertinent data {{for their use}} are given in tables 1 - 4. It is shown that the indication accuracies of these weirs are more {{than that of the}} conventional V-notch. For five of the designed weirs the indication accuracies are more than that of the conventional rectangular weir at lower heads of flow. All these <b>proportional</b> <b>weirs,</b> except the parabolic based weir, have added advantages over the V-notch in regard to fixing and finding the crest level. Experiments with five weirs (four symmetrical and one unsymmetrical) having rectangular bases and one (symmetrical) with a parabolic base show very good agreement with the theory and give consistent values for the coefficient of discharge, Cd, varying between 0. 588 and 0. 605, within the ranges of the experiments...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} theoretical {{analysis of}} flow through a quadrant plate weir {{is made in}} the light of the generalized theory of <b>proportional</b> <b>weirs,</b> using a numerical optimization procedure. It is shown that the flow through the quadrant plate weir has a linear discharge-head relationship valid for certain ranges of head. It is shown that the weir is associated with a reference plane or datum from which all heads are reckoned. Further, it is shown that the measuring range of the quadrant plate weir can be considerably enhanced by extending the tangents to the quadrants at the terminals of the quadrant plate weir. The importance of this weir (when the datum of the weir lies below its crest) as an outlet weir for grit chambers is highlighted. Experiments show excellent agreement with the theory by giving a constant average coefficient of discharge...|$|R
40|$|Of {{the many}} factors {{that govern the}} {{settling}} phenomenon, the flow velocity in the settling tanks can be controlled favorably by fixing suitably designed weirs at the outlets of the tanks. The velocity at the bottom should not dislodge the particles that have already settled. These requirements might be met with by velocities which are controlled to be constant {{with respect to the}} depth of flow, or velocities which reduce linearly with increasing depth or velocities that vary inversely with the depth. To achieve these types of velocity control, new <b>proportional</b> <b>weirs</b> have been designed. Very near to the outlet of the tank, over a small length, the flow was found to be turbulent and noncompliant with the expected type of velocity control. This small length of the disturbance may be provided over and above the theoretical settling length of the tank, for efficient sedimentation...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the study and designs of two {{important}} <b>proportional</b> <b>weirs</b> having the discharge-head characteristics of Q α H 2 / 3 In the first design a geometrically simple weir {{in the form of a}} rectangular weir over a inverted V-notch (Chimney weir) is presented. This weir gives for all flows above a threshold depth a discharge proportional to H 2 / 3 within a maximum percentage error of ± 1. 5, (measured above a reference plane) within certain limits of head. Second design is concerned with the self-basing weir in which a portion of the weir above the crest acts as a base. This design is achieved by using the complementary weir profile of a Quadratic weir above the parabolic base which has the significant property of fast convergence. This weir gives discharge for all flows above the threshold depth, proportional to (head) 2 / 3 measured above a reference plane, with increasing accuracy as head increases. Experiments with these two weirs confirm the theory by giving a constant average Coefficient of Discharge (Cd) of 0. 62. The importance of these weirs as a sensitive discharge measuring device in field and laboratory is highlighted...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study and analysis for {{effect of the}} geometrical characteristics, of the oblique cylindrical weir on discharge coefficient, wherefrom three sizes used for the weir and two angles for the deviation. From the results, {{it was found that}} the coefficient of discharge is affected by geometrical characteristics represented by radius of the weir and the angle of inclination with the wall of the channel. It was noticed that the increase in the radius of the weir lead to a low discharge coefficient of the cylindrical weir. And found that discharge coefficient of the oblique weir is higher than the discharge coefficient of the normal weir. And the value of discharge coefficient is directly <b>proportional</b> with the <b>weir</b> inclination.   </p...|$|R
