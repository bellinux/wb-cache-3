6000|$|It {{has been}} dubbed [...] "an atrocious act of simony;" [...] but the {{reasoning}} that so construes it is none so clear. The cardinals' hats carried with them vast benefices. These benefices were {{the property of the}} Church; they were in the gift and bestowal of the Pope, and in the bestowing of them the Pope levied a <b>proportionate</b> <b>tax.</b> Setting aside the argument that this tax was not an invention of Alexander's, does such a proceeding really amount to a [...] "sale" [...] of benefices? A sale presupposes bargaining, a making of terms between two parties, an adjusting of a price to be paid. There is evidence of no such marketing of these benefices; indeed one cardinal, vowed to poverty, received his hat without the imposition of a tax, another was Cesare's brother-in-law, Amanieu d'Albret, who had been promised the hat a year ago. It is further to be borne in mind that, four months earlier, the Pope had levied a similar decima, or tax, upon the entire College of Cardinals and every official {{in the service of the}} Holy See, for the purposes of the expedition against the Muslim, who was in arms against Christianity. Naturally that tax was not popular with luxurious, self-seeking, cinquecento prelates, who in the main cared entirely for their own prosperity and not at all for that of Christianity, and you may realize how, by levying it, Alexander laid himself open to harsh criticism.|$|E

40|$|I {{extend the}} general {{equilibrium}} techniques {{that have been}} applied to <b>proportionate</b> <b>taxes</b> to analyze {{the economic impact of}} non-proportionate taxes, including those with such commonly observed features as loss disallowances and progressivity. I analogize <b>proportionate</b> <b>taxes</b> to financial forwards and more general taxes to structured financial options. Option pricing theory and methods carry over naturally, and in general the burden of an income tax has a “certainty equivalent value ” equal to the price of a corresponding complex option. A direct consequence is that non-proportionate taxes specifically burden the risk in risky investment returns, but not the expected level of these returns. If expected return levels are determined as a function of risk, then they may be burdened indirectly, but the existence of such a functional relationship depends on particular choices of market model and portfolio, such as an investment in the market portfolio under the CAPM. After developing the general theory, I apply it to the specific example of a <b>tax</b> that is <b>proportionate</b> on gains but disallows loss offsets. Such a tax burdens the risk of returns and therefore encourages portfolio diversification targeted at risk minimization, without regar...|$|R
2500|$|In {{this paper}} Ramsey's {{contribution}} to economic theory was the elegant concept of Ramsey pricing. This is applicable {{in situations where}} a (regulated) monopolist wants to maximise consumer surplus whilst {{at the same time}} ensuring that its costs are adequately covered. This is achieved by setting the price such that the markup over marginal cost is inversely proportional to the price elasticity of demand for that good. Like its predecessor this paper was published in The Economic Journal in 1927. Ramsey poses the question that is to be solved {{at the beginning of the}} article: [...] "a given revenue is to be raised by <b>proportionate</b> <b>taxes</b> on some or all uses of income, the taxes on different uses being possibly at different rates; how much should these rates be adjusted in order that the decrement of utility may be a minimum?" [...] (Ramsey 1927). The problem was suggested to him by the economist Arthur Pigou and the paper was Ramsey's answer to the problem.|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} questions {{were developed by}} the Committee and staff economists to direct the economic analysis of Washington's existing tax system. In answering each of these questions the analysis will also answer further analytical questions such as: How much? Why? Is it getting better or worse? How do we compare to other states (where appropriate) ? 1) Do our tax revenues keep up with income? a) over the long run? b) during economic expansion? c) during economic downturns? Elasticity/Volatility 2) Have changes in our tax system such as exemptions, deductions and base broadening {{over the past ten}} years changed our elasticity? 3) Are our tax revenues stable? 1) Are our tax revenues predictable? 2) Is our tax system stable? If not, why not? Stability 3) Has the rainy day fund been an effective tool for keeping the tax base stable? 4) How stable are the major local taxes? 5) How do changes in the state tax system affect the stability of local taxes? 5 Equity/Fairness Ability to Pay 1) How regressive is our tax system (on both an income and wealth basis) ? 2) Is our system regressive when looking at lifetime equity? 3) How do business taxes affect regressivity when passed through to households? 4) To what extent can households shift or export taxes (to business, the federal government, etc.) ? 5) What taxes are on income, assets, and consumption? Benefits Received 6) Do people/entities that receive benefits from the state pay a corresponding amount of tax for the benefits (who is paying taxes, how are they being spent (answer at a high level)) ? 7) Which of our taxes are tied to benefits received? What percentage are these taxes compared to the tax system? How does that percentage compare with the percentage of these taxes in other states? 8) Regionally, where are taxes generated, and where are they spent? (Answer to the degree that information is available.) 9) To what extent are taxes targeted and earmarked? 10) Do activities that create negative impacts pay a <b>proportionate</b> <b>tax?</b> Horizontal Equity (Equity among similarly situated taxpayers) 11) Do similar businesses (businesses in the same industry) pay similar amounts of tax? 12) Do similar households (with similar income/household size) pay similar amounts of tax? 13) Do similar taxpayers in different locations pay significantly different taxes because of local taxes...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{suitable}} and justtaxation is {{one which is}} forever demanding solution, butnever solved. Adam Smith gave to the world certain rules which should governin taxation, {{the first of which}} was that 2 ̆ 2 The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities - that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state. 2 ̆ 2 While most writers on political economy have been disposed to accept this as a sound and just rule, some have objected to it that it puts out of view the fact that government protects persons as well as property, and that, if the burdens of government should be proportional to what is protected by jt, then persons should be taxed, not only in respect to the revenue they enjoy, but also, regardless of revenue, in return for the protection they receive as persons. This is plausible, but the practical difficulties in its application are numerous. One of these is the impossibility of estimating the comparative value of protection to one 2 ̆ 7 s person and to his property. Given io,ooo to be collected as taxes from a hundred persons, one-half of whom receive an aggregate revenue of ioo,ooo, while the others have no revenue at all; shall we say that the life and liberty of a man shall be set over against an income of i,ooo, so that, while taxing the income 5 per cent., the poll-tax shall be 50 ? Such a rating would be perfectly arbitrary, because elements of comparison are entirely wanting; but, while we should probably agree that the relative rating of protection to the person was ridiculously low as compared with the rating of property, we should probably also agree that {{it would be impossible to}} collect such poll-taxes from persons who had no taxable incomes. Again, when the value of protection to the person is in question, some writers insist that this is greatest to those who are physically or mentally weak and feeble, and who, in the absence of government, would be least able to protect themselves; and, consequently, must become the prey of the more vigorous and strong, and probably fall into a condition of slavery. The <b>proportionate</b> <b>tax,</b> say these writers, would, consequently, be largest upon the weak and feeble...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{research}} what the gaming industry pays in taxes to the local and state governments, and if the gaming industry pays a <b>proportionate</b> share of <b>taxes</b> compared to the other sources of tax revenue generated from other non-gaming businesses in the State of Nevada. The scope of the paper is limited to the State of Nevada, and more specifically, Clark County. The sources used were personal observations, as well as published literature. In conclusion, the research will show that not only does the gaming industry pay a <b>proportionate</b> share of <b>taxes</b> to the local and state governments, but it will further show that the gaming industry pays a larger percentage of taxes than other non-gaming businesses in the State of Nevada to the local and state governments...|$|R

It is shown that, {{in the presence of}} collection costs modeled as an increasing function of the tax rate: (a) the standard rules of optimal commodity taxation (the Ramsey, the inverse elasticity, the Corlett-Hague rules) may no longer be valid; (b) tariffs may replace domestic taxes as a second-best revenue-raising device; and (c) the optimal tariff/tax structure may be uniform rather than differentiated.

5000|$|The land {{taxation}} system was first established during the Taika Reform in 645 {{along with the}} adoption of the Chinese judicial system known as the ritsuryō codes (...) [...] The previous system was an imitation of the Tang Dynasty's corvee taxation system, known as the soyōchō system (soyōchō). Taxes were paid in the form of rice and other crops under this system, and the tax rates were determined through the land survey created by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. A <b>proportionate</b> annual <b>tax</b> was assessed according to the yield of a given plot of land. The principal farmer's name was registered in the land survey, and that farmer would be held accountable for the land tax. The payment could also be held as part of the village's collective responsibility under the Murauke System (Muraukesei).|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the joint}} {{hypotheses}} of consumption and tax smoothing are shown {{to imply that}} the present value of expected proportionate declines in government non-interest outlays is approximately equal to a log-linear function of the budget deficit and private dissaving. In this exact linear relation, the budget deficit signals declines in future government outlays, after controlling for prospective changes in the tax base. Private dissaving controls for such prospective changes since, under the joint hypotheses, the present value of expected <b>proportionate</b> rises in <b>tax</b> revenues are approximately equal to a log-linear function of private dissaving. Both exact linear relations are tested in a VAR framework on annual post-World War II U. S. data. We find considerable empirical support for the theory. 19 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{distinction}} between property rules and liability rules has revolutionized {{our understanding of}} many areas of law. But scholars have long assumed that this distinction has no relevance to tax law. This assumption is flatly wrong. Tax law currently uses both property rules and liability rules, and the choice between them has real consequences. When a taxpayer violates a requirement for a favorable tax status, tax law either imposes additional <b>tax</b> <b>proportionate</b> to the harm (a liability rule) or imposes the draconian penalty of taking away the tax status entirely (a property rule). This recognition has three key implications. First, Congress can and should draw on the rich property and liability rule literature to draft better tax legislation and to reform the tax code. Second, novel variations on property and liability rules {{can be used to}} rethink the remedies given to the IRS. Third, tax law will enrich the literature on property and liability rules across many other areas of law...|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The policies and procedures of the CDFI and NMTC Programs help ensure that awards and allocations generally are proportionate to the numbers of qualified applicants that serve metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. The CDFI Programs authorizing legislation and regulations require that award recipients constitute a geographically diverse group, serving metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas and Native communities from different U. S. regions. To meet this requirement, CDFI Program officials have used the application review process and established a goal of matching the proportion of awards to the proportion of qualified applicants that primarily serve nonmetropolitan areas. This proportion changed {{from year to year}} depending on the number of qualified applicants that served nonmetropolitan areas. According to officials, revisions to the award procedures in the fiscal year 2012 funding round will enhance the CDFI Programs ability to achieve proportionality. In 2006, Congress, in the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, added a requirement for the NMTC Program that nonmetropolitan counties receive a proportional allocation of qualified equity investments. To meet this requirement, in 2008, the NMTC Program implemented two goals in its application review process. The first goal requires that a <b>proportionate</b> number of <b>tax</b> credits are allocated to recipients that principally serve nonmetropolitan counties. The second goal requires that at least 20 percent of all community investments resulting from the annual NMTC allocations are made in eligible nonmetropolitan counties. ...|$|R
