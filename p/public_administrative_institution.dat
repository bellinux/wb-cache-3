40|$|AbstractThe field {{literature}} reveals multiple {{approaches of}} local public service performance. Directly managed by <b>public</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>institutions</b> or by private agents through concession or public-private partnership, the public services should respond to important requirements concerning the {{higher level of}} citizens’ satisfaction. In this context, the periodical evaluation both of citizens’ satisfaction and of the economic performance achieved by the public services becomes necessary in view to accomplish good administration of a local community. Based on the field literature {{and a series of}} socio-economic empirical evaluations, the current paper aims to present both comparative results and relevant conclusions from the prospect of the principles of good administration. Our approach is based on the concept of good governance making indirectly the necessary assertions for good administration...|$|R

It has its origins in 1885 which is when Department of Antiquities and Arts decided to start conducting real scientific studies of archaeological sites.

5000|$|These {{difficulties}} {{were largely}} due to the mismatch between the status of ENAC and the nature of its business, which required it to provide courses for students and trainees who were not all officials from the supervisory authority, and to use teaching staff from different origins. The cumbersome process for allocating university budget also created challenges after other types of income, such as non-public resources, were reduced. This happened more in the years 1958-1964. In 1962, the management of ENAC considered raising tuition fees, courses prices and fees for customers outside from the Directorate General for Civil Aviation. However, the status of the institution meant this involved a complex approval process that ultimately lead to paralysis. For this reason, the separate status of [...] "public administrative institution" [...] appeared more appropriate. The final decision was taken in the form of Decree No. 70-347 on 13 April 1970, with application from 1 January 1971. This made the school a <b>public</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>institution.</b> The ENAC was given a board of directors, with René Lemaire as its first president.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The paper aims to {{ascertain}} the governance arrangements of higher education providers in Cambodia and to seek insights into institutional governance while its higher education sector is in a significant transition towards the market model. Design/methodology/approach – The empirical research underpinning this paper applies a qualitative method, based on an interpretivist approach to inquiry. The study uses semi-structured interviews with 38 key research participants from relevant institutions. The data analysis follows a thematic coding approach. Findings – The study has found that despite their divergent governance arrangements, three forms of higher education providers – public institution, <b>public</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>institution</b> and private institution – have become increasingly similar because of their convergent trend towards commercialization and politicization. These two critical issues are considered threats to institutional development in Cambodia. Research limitations/implications – The {{interviews were conducted with}} the key actors at leadership and management levels. This leaves room for future research to investigate the institutional governance issue at faculty and student levels to develop a deeper understanding about the on-theground implementation. This paper is a useful information source for policymakers, institutional leaders and educational practitioners. Originality/value – This paper addresses the under-researched issue of institutional governance in Cambodia and critically examines the assumption that devolution and privatization of higher education in Cambodia will help advance the sector for economic development. The paper contributes to the ongoing academic debate in the higher education domain while higher education institutions are struggling to sustain their place in the competitive marketplaceGriffith Business School, Department of International Business and Asian StudiesNo Full Tex...|$|E

In this model, the emperor uses {{part of his}} tax income to finance the building of <b>public</b> capital and <b>administrative</b> <b>institutions.</b> This “institutional capital” enhances the productivity {{of the economy and}} limits extortion by the county magistrates. The dynastic cycle is driven by random shocks to the authority of the emperor and his central administration, which change the efficiency of institutional capital...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{sketches}} {{an organization}} theory-based {{approach to the}} study of <b>public</b> <b>administrative</b> behavior, <b>institutions</b> and developments in the context of democratic governance. The approach is here called the ‘Bergen approach’ because it originated as part of developing a department of public administration and organization theory at the University of Bergen. Today, however, it has offspring and contributors at several Norwegian universities and colleges. It combines an interest in the preconditions and consequences of different administrative forms and processes with an interest in theories of democracy, assuming that an improved understanding of public administration is essential to a comprehension of political and societal life in general. The paper is organized in the following way: First the international and local contexts of the Bergen approach are outlined. Then the program’s foundational ideas are presented, followed by a discussion of some key theoretical ideas and controversies. Finally it is asked whether the program is still kicking. organization theory; organization theory; public administration; governance; democratization; democratization...|$|R
40|$|This book {{focuses on}} two {{important}} {{trends in the}} future of Administrative Law. The first is the relevance of administrative law for developing legitimacy and accountability of multi-level regulatory systems. In a time of global trade in goods and services, as well as increasing interconnectedness of <b>public</b> <b>institutions,</b> <b>administrative</b> law is in a period of growth and transformation. This book examines these transformations in the context of global administrative law, as evidenced by increasing interest in the nature and conditions of EU administrative law, and the movement towards increasingly intense regulatory cooperation in bilateral settings (for example EU-US) as well as multilateral fora (for example in international organizations such as the WTO) ...|$|R
40|$|Introducing {{and leading}} change in any field is a {{difficult}} and complex task with no mapped path or certain route that guarantees success. Working in a <b>public</b> and <b>administrative</b> <b>institution</b> rarely offers opportunities for introducing and leading creative and innovative changes. However, my work on various information management tasks {{gave me a chance}} to lead change in a number of international organizations for which I worked, discovering new or improved information solutions, products and services. In retrospect, leading change in information management was a sine qua non of my long career and is a major focus of this Context Statement. This Context Statement offers a review of my own public works and achievements during my long professional career in information management. It concentrates on four public works, describing them in chronological order. It defines main influencers, theories, concepts and people that made the greatest impact on my career; evaluates the work performed, the technology used, the results achieved, and the lessons learned. The Context Statement also offers a thematic review of my public works, putting them in the perspective of the dramatically changed world of information management, the global impact of information, the democratisation of scientific and technical information, and the information ethics. The Context Statement concludes that, if we - the information managers - do not lead change and instigate constant innovation and modernization of our field, we will become museum custodians, instead of a leading avant-garde in today’s knowledge economy and the information world in which we live...|$|R
