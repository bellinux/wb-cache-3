30|$|The Alcell {{process is}} a typical organosolv process using aqueous ethanol, which was {{developed}} by Repap Enterprises and was commercialized in 1989 [61]. The Alcell process involves organosolv pulping with delignification using aqueous ethanol as the cooking liquor. The pH of the cooking liquor is relatively low, owing to the generation of organic acids from hemicellulose. As such, the cooking process is carried out under acidic conditions. The <b>protolignin</b> can be subjected to condensation reactions between the α-position of the side chain and the 6 -position of another aromatic ring [62, 63]. Liu et al. studied the condensed phenolic groups in solubilized and residual lignin during the Alcell process by 31 P NMR. Accordingly, the condensed phenolic OH content of Alcell lignin (solubilized lignin) was {{lower than that of}} kraft lignin because some of the <b>protolignin</b> was condensed during the Alcell process, which led to issues with solubility and pulp retention [64].|$|E
40|$|The {{condensation}} {{degrees of}} protolignins in 12 species of softwoods, and its variation within {{the trunk of}} 30 -year-old Hinoki（Chamaecyparis obtusa Endl. ） were discussed, using the phenyl nucleus-exchange method. The phenyl nucleus-exchange method is a novel degradation method for lignin allowing the C-C linkages between side chains and phenyl nuclei to be cleaved selectively and almost quantitatively. The procedures in this method are simple, {{and based on the}} products, information on the condensation degree of <b>protolignin</b> is rapidly obtained without isolating lignin. The variation of condensation degree of <b>protolignin</b> in horizontal sequence within the trunk of 30 -year-old Hinoki was approximately similar at each height, in which it increased slightly once from bark side to pith, then exhibited a minimum value at the sapwood/heartwood boundary section, and increased again in heartwood. On the other hand, the variation of condensation degeen in oblique sequence, which is the succession from the top downwards of the sections fromed in the same years, was less on the whole, compared with that in horizontal sequence. The condensation degrees in 12 species of softwoods were close one another. 針葉樹 12 種のプロトリグニンの縮合度およぴ 30 年生ヒノキ（Chamaecyparis obtusa Endl. ）樹幹内におけるその変動に検討を加えた。ヒノキ樹幹内において，各樹高での半径方向における変動パターンは互いに類似しており，いずれも心辺材境界部を含む区分で最小値を示した。一方，形成年度を同じくする区分の樹高方向の変動は，半径方向と比較して全般に小さかった。プロトリグニンの縮合度は，針葉樹 12 種で互いに近似していた...|$|E
40|$|In the {{structural}} analysis of lignins by C- 13 -NMR, signal overlap limits definitive assignment and accurate intensity measurement. Selective labeling by C- 13 -enrichment {{of a specific}} carbon in lignin enhances its signal intensity in the spectrum. Further enhancement of the specifically labeled carbons can be realized via difference spectra created from the enriched and unenriched samples. Difference 2 D C- 13 -H- 1 correlation (HSQC) NMR spectra, derived from the spectra of specifically C- 13 -enriched lignin model polymers (so-called dehydrogenation polymers) and their unenriched counterparts, {{take advantage of the}} enhanced dispersion afforded by both C- 13 and H- 1 chemical shifts, diminishing the difficulties arising from the signal-overlap problem and aiding in definitive signal assignments. In this research, <b>protolignin</b> in xylem cell walls was specifically C- 13 -enriched at all of the individual phenylpropanoid side-chain carbons by feeding C- 13 -enriched coniferins to growing stems of Ginkgo biloba. The whole xylem fractions containing C- 13 -enriched and unenriched protolignins were dissolved in a mixture of N-methylimidazole and DMSO, and then acetylated. Solution state 2 D-NMR (HSQC) spectra of the acetylated whole cell wall were acquired. Difference spectra between the walls containing C- 13 -enriched and unenriched lignins afforded simplified 2 D spectra in which well-separated signals were assigned exclusively to the specifically enriched carbons. This novel NMR technique provides a useful tool for elucidation of entire <b>protolignin</b> in the cell wall of ginkgo xylem...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{insight into}} the {{structure}} and composition of industrial (technical) lignins is needed to devise efficient thermal, bio- or chemocatalytic valorisation strategies. Six such technical lignins covering three main industrial pulping methods (Indulin AT Kraft, Protobind 1000 soda lignin and Alcell, poplar, spruce and wheat straw organosolv lignins) were comprehensively characterised by lignin composition analysis, FT-IR, pyrolysis-GC-MS, quantitative 31 P and 2 D HSQC NMR analysis and molar mass distribution by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC). A comparison of nine SEC methods, including the first analysis of lignins with commercial alkaline SEC columns, showed molar masses to vary considerably, allowing some recommendations to be made. The lignin molar mass decreased in the order: Indulin Kraft > soda P 1000 > Alcell > OS-W ∼ OS-P ∼ OS-S, regardless of the SEC method chosen. Structural identification and quantification of aromatic units and inter-unit linkages indicated that all technical lignins, including the organosolv ones, have considerably been degraded and condensed by the pulping process. Importantly, low amounts of β- ether linkages were found compared to literature values for <b>protolignin</b> and lignins obtained by other, milder isolation processes. Stilbenes and ether furfural units could also be identified {{in some of the}} lignins. Taken together, the insights gained {{in the structure of the}} technical lignins, in particular, the low β-O- 4 contents, carry implications for the design of lignin valorisation strategies including (catalytic) depolymerisation and material applications...|$|E
