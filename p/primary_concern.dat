5|$|Control {{of water}} was the <b>primary</b> <b>concern</b> in the {{building}} of the dam. Power generation has allowed the dam project to be self-sustaining: proceeds from the sale of power repaid the 50-year construction loan, and those revenues also finance the multimillion-dollar yearly maintenance budget. Power is generated in step with and only with the release of water in response to downstream water demands.|$|E
5|$|Fielding was {{concerned}} with the audience's reaction to his various scenes. This is internally reflected in {{the actions of the}} character Merital in Love in Several Masques in controlling the behaviour of Helen and that many of his characters believe that they are either actors or are performing on a stage. Also, this is a <b>primary</b> <b>concern</b> of Fielding's when he crafted his Scriblerian plays.|$|E
5|$|The double bottoms {{are also}} subject to design constraints. The <b>primary</b> <b>concern</b> {{is that they}} be high enough to allow the passage of pipes and cables. These areas must also be roomy enough to allow people safe access to perform surveys and maintenance. On the other hand, {{concerns}} of excess weight and wasted volume keep the double bottoms very tight spaces.|$|E

40|$|Patient-centered {{care has}} become {{increasingly}} important over the last decade, both in {{physical and mental health}} care. In support of patient-centered care, providers need to understand consumers׳ <b>primary</b> <b>concerns</b> during treatment visits. The current study explored what <b>primary</b> <b>concerns</b> were brought to recurring psychiatric visits for a sample of adults with severe mental illness (N= 164), whether these concerns were concordant with those recognized by providers, and which factors predicted concordance. We identified 17 types of <b>primary</b> <b>concerns,</b> most commonly medications and symptoms, with only 50 % of visits showing evidence of at least partial agreement between consumers and providers. Contrary to expectations, consumer demographics, activation, trust, and perceptions of patient-centeredness were not predictive, while greater preferences for autonomy predicted poorer agreement. Our findings highlight the need for interventions to promote a shared understanding of <b>primary</b> <b>concerns</b> in recurring psychiatric visits. Further attention is needed to ensure the provision of patient-centered care such that consumer concerns are acknowledged and addressed within recurring psychiatric visits...|$|R

5|$|A {{total of}} 800 {{students}} from both Platte Canyon High School {{and the nearby}} Fitzsimmons Middle School were rapidly evacuated. Morrison's demands were unknown, although police confirmed that his <b>primary</b> <b>concern</b> was a request {{for the police to}} back away. All students, except the hostages, were safely evacuated by 12:10 p.m. and by 3:00 p.m. all had been taken to Deer Creek Elementary School. Parents were able to gain little information from authorities, who remained silent regarding the issue while the crisis continued.|$|E
5|$|As governor, Wickliffe's <b>primary</b> <b>concern</b> was the Panic of 1837. He {{advocated}} raising {{property taxes}} to offset spending deficits that had climbed to $42,000 by 1839, but the legislature borrowed money {{to meet the}} current expenses instead. Wickliffe maintained the state's credit by paying the interest due on state securities. The only areas where he called for more spending were improvements in river navigation, preservation of state archives, and public education. Aside from these concerns, he was inundated with requests for clemency.|$|E
5|$|Coke {{was noted}} as {{deriving}} great enjoyment from and working {{hard at the}} law, but enjoying little else. He was versed in the Latin classics and maintained a sizeable estate, but the law was his <b>primary</b> <b>concern.</b> Francis Bacon, his main competitor, {{was known as a}} philosopher and man of learning, but Coke had no interest in such subjects. Notably, when given a copy of the Novum Organum by Bacon, Coke wrote puerile insults in it.|$|E
40|$|National Hospice Study {{data for}} 1981 - 82 {{were used to}} predict the {{location}} of care for terminal cancer patients. Sites of care were conventional care in hospitals, hospital-based hospice care, and hospice care in the home. Subjects were terminal cancer patients with a prognosis of less than 6 months of life who were attended by a <b>primary</b> <b>concerned</b> person. There were 1, 732 patients 18 - 99 years old- 293 conventional care, 612 hospital-based hospice care, and 827 hospice home care patients. Data sources were the patient, the <b>primary</b> <b>concerned</b> person, the family, and the medical record. Data were obtained at initial interview for the study, 1 -week followup, reassessment every 2 weeks, and bereavement interviews. Information was grouped in the following categories: patient functional status, patient psychological outlook, symptomatology, medical condition, and characteristics of the <b>primary</b> <b>concerned</b> person and family. Conclusions were reached by univariate and multivariate analysis. First, a progression of functional disability was found to exist among care sites, from hospice home care for the least disabled to hospital-based hospice care to conventional care for patients with the greatest disabilities. The location of care was best explained by the patient's functional capacity. Second, the location of care {{was found to be}} poorly explained by extent of organ involvement or specific symptoms. Third, the <b>primary</b> <b>concerned</b> persons of patients under hospice home care experienced more stress but reacted no differently when compared with <b>primary</b> <b>concerned</b> persons at other care sites. Fourth, patients under hospice home care survived the longest and reported greater family closeness than other care groups...|$|R

5|$|Du Bois was bitterly {{disappointed}} {{that many of}} his colleaguesparticularly the NAACPdid not support him during his 1951 PIC trial, whereas working class whites and blacks supported him enthusiastically. After the trial, Du Bois lived in Manhattan, writing and speaking, and continuing to associate primarily with leftist acquaintances. His <b>primary</b> <b>concern</b> was world peace, and he railed against military actions, such as the Korean War, which he viewed as efforts by imperialist whites to maintain colored people in a submissive state.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} at least one report of {{deliberate}} vandalism to the structure, but the <b>primary</b> <b>concern</b> relating to visitors to the site {{is the possibility of}} damage caused through tread wear. The site is not heavily trafficked and any wear to the structure since the 1980s would likely be mitigated by the protection from the natural re-establishment of plant growth over its surface. Updates by the North York Moors National Park authority and English Heritage suggest that natural weathering and grazing sheep represent greater erosion risks to the structure than do human agents.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} {{recorded}} {{of the first}} twenty years of Egbert's reign, apart from campaigns against the Cornish in the 810s. The historian Richard Abels argues that {{the silence of the}} Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was probably intentional, concealing Egbert's purge of Beorhtric's magnates and suppression of rival royal lines. Relations between Mercian kings and their Kentish subjects were distant. Kentish ealdormen did not attend the court of King Coenwulf, who quarrelled with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury (805–832) over the control of Kentish monasteries; Coenwulf's <b>primary</b> <b>concern</b> seems to have been {{to gain access to the}} wealth of Kent. His successors Ceolwulf I (821–23) and Beornwulf (823–26) restored relations with Archbishop Wulfred, and Beornwulf appointed a sub-king of Kent, Baldred.|$|E

5|$|Although a <b>primary</b> <b>concern</b> of the Sprint missile {{was high}} speed, the design was not {{optimized}} for maximum energy, but instead {{relied on the}} first stage (booster) to provide as much thrust as possible. This left the second stage (sustainer) lighter than optimal, to improve its maneuverability. Staging was under ground control, with the booster cut away from the missile body by explosives. The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the flight profile. For control, the first stage used a system that injected Freon into the exhaust to cause thrust vectoring to control the flight. The second stage used small air vanes for control.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{had many}} {{friends in the}} eastern aristocracy, and quickly gained a {{reputation}} among them as a frontier leader. He ran a successful horse-breeding enterprise that won him acclaim throughout the Northwest Territory. Harrison became a champion of lower land prices, a <b>primary</b> <b>concern</b> of settlers in the Territory at the time. The U.S. Congress had legislated a territorial land policy that led to high land costs, which many of the territory's residents disliked. In October 1799, after it had been determined that the Northwest Territory's population had reached a sufficient number to have a delegate in the U.S. Congress, Harrison ran for election. He campaigned to encourage further migration to the territory, which eventually led to statehood.|$|E
5|$|Otjes's {{approach}} is more empirical {{than that of}} many contributors to Political Animals and Animal Politics. He examines the Dutch Party for the Animals (PvdD), which, in 2006, won two seats in the House of Representatives. Otjes explores whether the PvdD's presence has changed {{the amount of time}} more established parties spent on animal issues by examining both parliamentary speeches and motions before and after the introduction of the PvdD members. He finds that established parties began to talk more about animal issues in 2006, and that this could be attributed to conflict between the PvdD and the established parties. Though Otjes allows that his study's relevance may seem limited, he concludes that smaller parties can affect government agenda by remaining focused on their own <b>primary</b> <b>concern.</b>|$|E

5|$|Story and {{characters}} were a <b>primary</b> <b>concern</b> for Gilbert and Winnick. The pair based the game's cast on friends, family members, acquaintances, and stereotypes. For example, Winnick's girlfriend Ray was {{the inspiration for}} Razor, while Dave and Wendy were based, respectively, on Gilbert and a fellow Lucasfilm employee named Wendy. According to Winnick, the Edison family was shaped after characters from EC Comics and Warren Publishing magazines. The sentient meteor that brainwashes Dr. Fred {{was inspired by a}} segment from the 1982 anthology film Creepshow. A man-eating plant, similar to that of Little Shop of Horrors, was included as well. The developers sought {{to strike a balance between}} tension and humor with the game's story.|$|E
5|$|William {{was part}} of the first {{generation}} to grow to maturity under the Royal Marriages Act 1772, which forbade descendants of George II from marrying unless they either obtained the monarch's consent or, if over the age of 25, gave twelve months' notice to the Privy Council. Several of George III's sons, including William, chose to cohabit with the women they loved, rather than seek a wife. Having legitimate issue was not a <b>primary</b> <b>concern</b> for William, as {{he was one of the}} younger sons of George III, he was not expected to figure in the succession, which was considered secure once the Prince of Wales married and had a daughter, Princess Charlotte, second-in-line to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Alejandro Gonzalez Malavé, the {{undercover}} agent who was accompanying the activists, was not indicted {{for his part}} in the slayings because he was granted immunity for testifying against other officers, but was removed from the police force due to public pressure. In February 1986, he was acquitted of kidnapping the taxi driver. His lawyer had argued that he was acting under orders and, therefore, it was the government who was actually guilty of kidnapping. This, despite the testimony presented by officer Carmelo Cruz who had testified that it was Gonzalez who recklessly endangered the hostage's life. The prosecution had provided evidence that he threatened the hostage at gunpoint, drove the car, and, when the car approached the mountaintop, refused to free the hostage despite suggestions from the activists. These actions, according to officer Cruz, were contrary to standard police procedures since his <b>primary</b> <b>concern</b> should have been the safety of the hostage. Nevertheless, the Puerto Rico Police Department did not reinstate Gonzalez as an active police officer, a fact that he publicly expressed resentment over, and subsequently threatened to provide incriminating evidence to the media about other individuals involved in the shootings unless reinstated.|$|E

5|$|Diocletian's <b>primary</b> <b>concern</b> was {{to place}} the {{provision}} of food supplies to the army on a rational and sustainable basis. To this end, the emperor {{put an end to}} the arbitrary exaction of food levies (indictiones) for the army, whose burden fell mainly on border provinces and which had ruined them economically. He instituted a system of regular annual indictiones ("tax levies") with the tax demanded set in advance for 5 years and related to the amount of cultivated land in each province, backed by a thorough empire-wide census of land, peasants and livestock. To deal with the problem of rural depopulation in some areas (and consequent loss of food production), he decreed that peasants, who had always been free to leave their land during the Principate, must never leave the locality in which they were registered by the census (legal term is 'origo'). This measure had the effect of legally tying tenant farmers (coloni) and their descendants to their landlords' estates.|$|E
5|$|Having {{previously}} {{served in}} the Virginia House of Delegates and as a presidential elector, the aging Scott now ran for governor. His 1808 campaign was skillfully managed by his step-son-in-law, Jesse Bledsoe, and he won a convincing victory over John Allen and Green Clay. A fall on the icy steps of the governor's mansion early in his term confined Scott to crutches {{for the rest of}} his life, and left him heavily reliant on Bledsoe, whom he appointed Secretary of State. Although he frequently clashed with the state legislature over domestic matters, the <b>primary</b> <b>concern</b> of his administration was the increasing tension between the United States and Great Britain that eventually led to the War of 1812. Scott's decision to appoint William Henry Harrison as brevet major general in the Kentucky militia, although probably in violation of the state constitution as Harrison was not a resident of the state, was nonetheless praised by the state's citizens. After his term expired, Scott returned to his Canewood estate. His health declined rapidly, and he died on October 22, 1813. Scott County, Kentucky, and Scott County, Indiana, are named in his honor, as are the cities of Scottsville, Kentucky, and Scottsville, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|In 1872, Thompson {{was elected}} {{president}} of Otterbein University, and remained in that position until 1886. He received a doctorate in divinity from Otterbein the following year. As president, Thompson continued to teach and delivered speeches around the country on school or church business. Thompson took office shortly before the financial Panic of 1873, with the result that his <b>primary</b> <b>concern</b> as president was keeping the college funded. In this he was successful, although the college had to borrow money to stay afloat until the economy recovered. After the initial debt was incurred, Thompson worked to raise donations to pay it off more quickly. He also worked to attract new professors to teach at Otterbein, improving both the quality of education and the school's reputation among scholars. Thompson was involved in organizing the General Board of Education of the United Brethren Church, which served as a coordinating body for the schools affiliated with the church.|$|E
