500|$|God's Choice: The Total World of a Fundamentalist Christian School is a 1986 {{book written}} by Alan Peshkin. It is {{a profile of}} an Illinois Christian {{fundamentalist}} school—its policies, practices, and participants. Peshkin, then <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> <b>at</b> the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, intended his account to be both impartial and [...] "empathetic". He presents the fundamentalists as disciplined, dedicated, and determined with [...] "formulas for success" [...] opposite [...] "fragmented and defensive" [...] detractors. They believe in [...] "one Truth"—God's plan—and reject philosophies of multiple truths. A teacher told Peshkin that {{their job is to}} prepare students for this [...] "one pattern" [...] of thought. In turn, the community's constituents do not wish to leave, but appreciate conformity as an end in itself. Peshkin describes the school as a [...] "total institution": a place where many similar people live by their own formal rules apart from outside society, as based on Erving Goffman's 1961 essay. Peshkin asserts that this was a natural conclusion from a school [...] "based on absolute truth". God's Choice was the third book in his series of studies on school–community relationships. It was published by the University of Chicago Press.|$|E
