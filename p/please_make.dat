Bill Maher, host of the HBO talk show Real Time with Bill Maher, said the threats against [...] "201" [...] demonstrated {{the importance of the}} First Amendment and other American civil liberties, and said, [...] "When South Park got threatened last week by Islamists incensed at their depiction of Muhammad, it served—or should serve—as a reminder that our culture isn't just different than one that makes death threats to cartoonists. It's better." [...] He added jokingly, [...] "If you don't get that, and you still want to kill someone over a stupid cartoon, <b>please</b> <b>make</b> it Garfield." ...|$|E

2500|$|From Sikkim Pallis {{had hoped}} {{to cross the border}} into Tibet proper, but due to {{political}} circumstances it was impossible to obtain the necessary permissions. Forced to alter his plans, he decided instead to make his way to Ladakh. He was accompanied by his close friend Richard Nicholson and one other member of their climbing party, Dr. Robert Roaf. Once in Ladakh, they discarded Western clothes in favor of the chuba, and assumed as much as possible a Tibetan manner of living. “It was our way of saying to our hosts: ‘We wish to be as one of you. <b>Please</b> <b>make</b> no unusual arrangements on our behalf. We love your tradition, and hope it will not be rashly changed. We have found means of attuning ourselves to its ways.’” ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} adapt Pettibon's artwork {{to meet the}} layout {{requirements}} of their albums and flyers, the members of Black Flag would alter it by cutting and pasting and adding their name, logo, and gig details to it. They would then make photocopies and put up dozens of flyers to promote their shows. Rollins recalls {{going out on a}} flyering mission with roadie Mugger in 1981 in which the pair would put a layer of paste onto a telephone pole, stick up the flyer, and then cover it with an additional coat of paste so that it would last for up to a year. The band members and their crew would do this for miles around, using dozens of flyers to promote a single performance. Pettibon, however, did not always appreciate the band's treatment of his art, which he provided to them largely for free. [...] "To me my work was the equivalent of a band like Black Flag or any other band who was righteously self-protective of recordings. I would give them original art and it would come back to me scrawled upon and taped over or whited out, and I'd always ask nicely, 'Could you <b>please</b> <b>make</b> a copy of this first and then do that?' Their master tapes were deemed sacrosanct, while my work was seen as completely disposable, but I'm not venting or complaining, just stating fact." [...] Pettibon also felt pigeonholed by his association with the band, and had a falling out with them in 1985 over artwork used {{on the cover of the}} Loose Nut album, which had been used for a flyer several years earlier. Ginn resurrected it without telling his brother and turned it over to drummer Bill Stevenson to do the layout, who cut it into pieces and used them as elements for the cover and lyric sheet. Pettibon became irate and he and Ginn stopped speaking for some time, though his artwork continued to be used for the remainder of the band's career.|$|E
