2500|$|The {{earliest}} domestic <b>plug</b> and <b>socket</b> {{is believed}} to be that patented by T.T. Smith in 1883. [...] This was shortly followed by patents from WB Sayers and G Hookham; these early designs had rectangular plugs with contact plates on either side. In 1885, two-pin plug designs appeared and in 1889 there were two-pin <b>plugs</b> and <b>sockets</b> in the GEC catalogue. [...] The 1893 GEC Catalogue included 3 sizes of what was described as Double <b>plug</b> <b>Sockets</b> with capacities described not in amps, but as 1 to 5 lights, 5 to 10 lights and 10 to 20 lights. [...] These were clearly recognisable as two-pin <b>plugs</b> and <b>sockets,</b> but with no indication as to pin size or spacing, they were sold as pairs. [...] The same catalogue included lampholder plugs for both BC and ES lampholders (capacity unspecified), and also a type of two-pole concentric <b>plug</b> and <b>socket</b> (similar to a very large versions of the concentric connectors used for laptop PC power connections) in the 1 to 5 lights and 5 to 10 lights capacities.

50|$|Socket {{technology}} for lower extremity limbs saw a revolution during the 1980s when John Sabolich C.P.O., invented the Contoured Adducted Trochanteric-Controlled Alignment Method (CATCAM) socket, later to evolve into the Sabolich Socket. He followed {{the direction of}} Ivan Long and Ossur Christensen as they developed alternatives to the quadrilateral socket, which in turn followed the open ended <b>plug</b> <b>socket,</b> created from wood. The advancement {{was due to the}} difference in the socket to patient contact model. Prior to this, sockets were made {{in the shape of a}} square shape with no specialized containment for muscular tissue. New designs thus help to lock in the bony anatomy, locking it into place and distributing the weight evenly over the existing limb as well as the musculature of the patient. Ischial containment is well known and used today by many prosthetist to help in patient care. Variations of the ischial containment socket thus exists and each socket is tailored to the specific needs of the patient. Others who contributed to socket development and changes over the years include Tim Staats, Chris Hoyt, and Frank Gottschalk. Gottschalk disputed the efficacy of the CAT-CAM socket- insisting the surgical procedure done by the amputation surgeon was most important to prepare the amputee for good use of a prosthesis of any type socket design.|$|E

He returned to Private Eye in 1978 to take over the task of illustrating [...] "Auberon Waughs Diary", which continued until 1986. The cartoons perfectly complemented Auberon Waughs scabrous and surreal flights of invective, and when Waugh moved his column to The Daily Telegraph as the [...] "Way of the World" [...] in 1990, Rushton followed. The Victoria and Albert Museum, recognising his accomplishments, commissioned 24 large colour illustrations that were collected as Willie Rushtons Great Moments of History. (Rushton had previous experience with the V&A when he had pulled a prank on the institution by labelling an electric <b>plug</b> <b>socket</b> in one of the galleries: [...] "Plug hole designed by Hans Plug (b. 1908)", which remained for a full year - to the great annoyance of a cleaner who had to use a hefty extension lead for 12 months so as not to damage the exhibit.) This large scale excursion into the use of colour was good practice for the monthly colour covers he created for the Literary Review when Waugh became its editor in the late 1980s. Rushton drew these covers along with the fortnightly caricatures for Private Eyes literary review page until his death.|$|E

Mick takes him to the doctors' surgery, where he is formally diagnosed with clinical depression and prescribed medication, which he refuses to take, but he changes his mind after conversations with Linda and Babe. At Stacey's Halloween party, Lee attempts to fix her <b>plug</b> <b>socket,</b> but does it incorrectly, leading to a heavily pregnant Stacey being electrocuted and her boyfriend, Martin Fowler (James Bye) punching Lee. This sends Lee on a downward spiral, but he feels better when he is informed that Stacey and the baby are fine. Meanwhile, Dean begins a relationship with Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), angering her sister Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) and she does everything in her power to split them up. Firstly, she attempts to persuade Mick to help her murder Dean, but after Mick decides against helping Ronnie in her plans, she tries to poison Dean. Shirley and Buster arrive just in time, however are furious to learn that Mick knew what Ronnie was planning, resulting in Buster punching Mick. Shirley, Buster and Jade spend Christmas dinner with the Carters, infuriating Dean, which results in his throwing a jug at Roxy, which cuts her face. Roxy attempts to leave Dean, but he is extremely apologetic and she forgives him. The next day, after Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) points out that Roxy's feisty personality has gone since she began dating Dean, she tries to leave him and end their relationship. Dean attempts to rape Roxy, but is stopped when Shirley enters, hearing Roxy's cries. Roxy flees, while Shirley finally sees Dean as a rapist. Roxy then bumps into Linda and Elaine, who encourage her to report the matter to the police, which she does. While Dean is having a bath, Shirley attempts to drown him, but she is unsuccessful and Dean strikes her as Linda enters. During an argument over Roxy, Dean admits that he raped Linda in Shirley's presence, and then goes into hiding from the police.|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} the tests {{results of the}} prototype design of hydraulically assisted injector, that is designed for gas supply into diesel engines. The construction of the injector allows for it positioning in the glow <b>plug</b> <b>socket,</b> so that the gas is injected directly into the combustion chamber. The cycle analysis of the four-cylinder Andoria ADCR engine with a capacity of 2. 6 dm 3 for different crankshaft rotational speeds allowed to determine the necessary time for fuel injection. Because of that, {{it was possible to}} determine the required mass flow rate of the injector, for replacing as much of the original fuel by gaseous fuel. To ensure a high value of flow inside the injector, supply pressure equal to 1 MPa was applied. High gas supply pressure requires high value of valve opening forces. For this purpose a injector with hydraulic control system, using a liquid under pressure for the opening process was designed. On the basis of air pressure measurements in the flow line after the injector, the analysis of opening and closing of the valve was made. Measurements of outflow mass of the injector were also carried out. The results showed that the designed injector meets the requirements necessary to supply ADCR engine by the CNG fuel...|$|E
40|$|Following a brief {{survey of}} the {{historic}} develop-ment of pneumatic prostheses the actual prin-ciples of prosthetic management in bilateral shoulder disarticulation or bilateral amelia are ex p 1 a i n e d. The active functions are restricted to active pronation and supination, active gripping of the terminal device “hook ” or “hand”, com-bined with pneumatic locking of free swinging shoulder and elbow jdints in one artificial arm; the cosmetic arm provides only space for the power package in the resin socket of the upper arm. Both arms are suspended on a Simpson frame. Thus optical control is concentrated on {{the movements of the}} functional arm. The reduction of valve control makes prosthetic training and use easier. Recently hybrid systems came into use be-cause electric power proved superior to pneu-matic power for pronation and supination and gripping, whereas CO, is still necessary for locking the elbow and the shoulder joint. The accumulator can be recharged daily at a <b>plug</b> <b>socket,</b> the CO container need only be refilled after one or two weeks ensuring more indepen-dence for the disabled. The advantage of such a prosthesis is the better appearance in public combined with a certain functional use. However only intensive foot training without prostheses provides independence in daily acti-vities, because even sophisticated prosthetic systems cannot make up completely for body loss...|$|E
