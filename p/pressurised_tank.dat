In this study a propulsion system for a cubesat with the main purpose of providing orbit manoeuvring and formation flying has been designed. This propulsion system is basically a cold gas system but it does not use a <b>pressurised</b> <b>tank</b> to store the gas, instead the propellant is chemically stored in cool gas generators. By storing the propellants chemically bounded in a solid material the system has no leakage, is unpressurised and can be stored for a long time without attendance. This advanced technology, developed by TNO, has already been used for a propulsion system, which will fly on the PR 0 BA 2 mission and provides a good opportunity to store propellant in a volume efficient way. Based on this propulsion system, needed changes and improvements of the system have been investigated {{in order to make it}} suitable for cubesats. This all led to a preliminary design of a scaled down system which has been designed using requirements for formation flying and which has the capability of being adaptive to any requirements and cubesat configuration due to its modular design principle. The system is capable to store as much gas as a normal tank solution by using only 1 / 6 of the volume. Within this study a development model has been built and tested. The successful tests verified the design of the micro gas generators and provide a promising basis for further steps...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Thesis is to develop the design process of the {{pressurised}} propellant tank for a water resistojet, applicable to nanosatellite missions.

The need for a small-sized pressure vessel is covered by the Detail Design delivered in this Thesis, which {{is a result of}} the application of decision making techniques as well as a structural analysis. It is possible to distinguish two ?elds of investigation throughout the work: design and structures. The design of the propellant tank is tackled following the Design Trades: a systems engineering approach which makes use of decision making, a trade-off process and uncertainty analysis. By applying a 10 -step methodology, a set of conceptual designs is developed and further re?ned into a preliminary design. As far as the structural analysis is concerned, both an analytical study and a Finite Element Analysis are completed. The former is mainly used for veri?cation and validation of the latter. The result is a Detail Design, ready for manufactureandtesting. As a result, a design compliant with the requirements is delivered, together with CAD and Finite Element models. This design involves a rectangular section <b>pressurised</b> <b>tank,</b> compatible with CubeSat structures, manufactured from aluminium via CNC milling.

50|$|This type of {{thruster}} can accelerate a {{large number}} of different liquid metals or alloys. The best performance (in terms of thrust efficiency and power-to-thrust ratio) can be obtained using high atomic weight alkali metals, such as cesium and rubidium (133 amu for Cs, 85.5 amu for Rb). These propellants have a low ionization potential (3.87 eV for Cs and 4.16 eV for Rb), low melting point (28.7 °C for Cs and 38.9 °C for Rb) and very good wetting capabilities. These features lead to low power losses due to ionization and heating and the capability to use capillary forces for feeding purposes (i.e. no <b>pressurised</b> <b>tanks</b> nor valves are required). Moreover, alkali metals have the lowest attitude to form ionized droplets or multiply-charged ions, thus leading to the best attainable mass efficiency.

Whenever prevention and mitigation systems are ineffective, catastrophic accidental scenarios as fires, explosion and dispersion {{of toxic substances}} may occur, thus increasing risks to people, environment and properties either within the plant borders or in the close surroundings of industrial plants. This paper deals with a simplified procedure for seismic risk analysis of typical industrial installations containing atmospheric storage <b>tanks,</b> <b>pressurised</b> horizontal <b>tanks</b> and pumps, based on historical database and literature data on natural-technological (Na-tech) accidents. The methodology can be applied for any industrial equipment and implemented in any existing code or procedure for risk assessment.

Preliminary numerical validation of the methodology has been also carried out via structural analysis that takes into account a single failure mode (Elephant Foot Buckling) that affects atmospheric storage tank, anchored or unanchored to ground. Starting from fragility data, probit analysis has been performed in order to obtain PGA thresholds values for earthquake-related structural damages and loss of containment. These results are certainly of interest for active and passive mitigation actions development, and for the implementation of Early Warning System, i. e., the set of actions that can be taken from the moment when a seismic event is triggered with a significant reliability to the moment the earthquake strikes in a given location...|$|R

A system may consist of a number of sub-networks separated by differing energy lines or pressure levels that serve neighbourhoods at different elevation, and some of these may have <b>pressurised</b> <b>tanks</b> so that the pumps need not operate continuously. In order that these transfer systems will adequately fulfil their intended functions, they may require the inclusion of pressure reducing or pressure sustaining valves. These days an understanding of some particular numerical method and the ability to implement them on a computer, for obtaining solutions for a large problem is a vitally needed skill. Computations associated with engineering practice have changed dramatically in the past quarter century from the estimation of a few key values by using a slide rule to the generation of pages of computer output that are the result of detailed simulations of system performance.

In these work a computer program has been developed which carries out the regular simulation of steady state pressure and flow in pipe system. The computer program is written in C Language, to solve the basic pipe system equations using linear method.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{hydrogen}} generation and storage systems optimization, {{related to a}} very large size hydraulic plant (Itaipu, 14 GW) in South America, is investigated using an original multilevel thermo-economic optimization approach developed by the Authors. Hydrogen is produced by water electrolysis employing time-dependent hydraulic energy related to the water which is not normally used by the plant, named “spilled water”. From a thermo-economic point of view, the two main aspects of the study are the optimal definition of the plant size and the whole system management. Both of them are strongly influenced by (i) spilled water energy variability related to its time-dependent distribution during the whole year, (ii) time-dependent electricity demand of Paraguay and Brazil (the owners of the Itaipu plant) electrical grids, and (iii) the hydrogen demand profile. The system analyzed here consists {{of a very large}} size hydrogen generation plant (hundreds of MW) based on pressurised water electrolysers fed with the so called “spilled water electricity”, the related H 2 storage, and the H 2 demand profile for Paraguay transport sector utilization. Since H 2 plant optimal size is strongly correlated to optimal management and viceversa, in this paper two hierarchical levels have been considered hour by hour on a complete year time period, in order to minimize capital and variable costs. This time period analysis is necessary to properly take into account spilled energy variability to find out H 2 production system optimal size, optimal storage solution and best economical results. For the optimal storage size, two different solutions have been carefully investigated: (i) classical long time H 2 physical storage using <b>pressurised</b> <b>tanks</b> at 200 bar; (ii) hybrid one using reduced size physical storage (one day time demand) where the energy to feed electrolysers is taken from electrical grid when spilled water energy is not available [Rivarolo M, Bogarin J, Magistri L, Massardo AF.

For both the two solutions, timedependent results are presented and discussed with particular emphasis to economic aspects, system size, capital costs and related investments.

A one-dimensional hydraulic transient solver was developed based on the classic water hammer theory and solved by the Method of Characteristics (MOC). The solver incorporates the pump-element described by Suter parameters, a <b>pressurised</b> surge <b>tank</b> (hydropneumatic vessel, HPV) and Vitkovsky's (2000) formula for unsteady friction description. The model was tested using transient pressure data and steady-state flow data from two hydraulic circuits installed at the Hydraulics Laboratory of the Civil Engineering Department, in Instituto Superior Técnico (Lisbon, Portugal). Pressure data were obtained at two/three locations (at the upstream end, at a middle section and at the downstream end). Transient tests with and without the HPV connected to the system were carried out for different flow rates. Transients were generated by the sudden stoppage of the pump. Collected data were compared {{with the results of}} the numerical modelling and used to calibrate model parameters. Good agreement between data and numerical results was obtained. Some tests with the HPV connected lead to higher pressure surges than when there was no protection in the system. These analyses are important to develop more solid and reliable numerical models as well to create awareness of the main uncertainties of developed models...|$|R
