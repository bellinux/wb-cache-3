A borrower’s <b>checking</b> <b>account</b> {{provides}} a bank with exclusive {{access to a}} continuous stream of borrower data, namely, the borrower’s <b>checking</b> <b>account</b> balances at the bank. Using {{a unique set of}} data that includes monthly and annual information on small-business borrowers at an anonymous Canadian bank, we provide empirical evidence that <b>checking</b> <b>account</b> information helps the bank to monitor commercial borrowers. We show the direct mechanism through which banks can use this information in monitoring. Our results provide empirical support for the notion of Black (Jrl of Fin Econ, 1975) and Fama (Jrl of Mon Econ, 1985) that, because of their role in the payments system, banks are “special” monitors. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} controversial bank policy of paying - rather than bouncing - overdrawn checks, debits or ATM withdrawals. We {{argue that it}} should fall under lending regulations only if consumers use the program to get intentional loans. In contrast, if the program primarily applies to <b>checking</b> <b>account</b> activity then it should fall under <b>checking</b> <b>account</b> regulations. A model of precautionary balance holding and <b>checking</b> <b>account</b> customer data are used to estimate the likelihood of overdrafting. Predicted overdrafts are compared to actual overdrafts to conclude that 79 % are explained by the model and thus thought to be mistakes due to the stochastic nature of household expenditures.

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} shows that the supply of deposits to <b>checking</b> <b>accounts</b> is not elastic {{with respect to the}} interest rates paid. That suggests that various features attached to <b>checking</b> <b>accounts</b> may be important in determining the supply of deposits and banks' and revenues from the fees. This study uses a national survey of <b>checking</b> <b>accounts</b> offered by financial institutions in 25 major metropolitan areas in the United States to analyze the effects of restrictions and fees imposed on <b>checking</b> <b>account</b> holders on the supply of deposits and on the banks' check fee revenues. The author places particular emphasis on relatively new restrictions designed to induce customers to adopt cost-saving behavior, such as restrictions on the return of canceled checks and on the use of live tellers. She finds the supply of deposits into <b>checking</b> <b>accounts</b> to be responsive to the bank's per-item fees, check return restrictions, teller restrictions, and foreign ATM fees. Because of this sensitivity of deposit supply, raising most of those fees was found to lower bank revenues from servicing the <b>checking</b> <b>accounts.</b> Only the fee on check return and the NSF fee were found to significantly raise bank revenues.

40|$|Do <b>checking</b> <b>accounts</b> help banks monitor borrowers? If they do, the {{rationale}} both for allowing regulated providers of liquidity to also make risky loans to commercial borrowers {{and for the}} government's providing deposit insurance becomes clearer. Using {{a unique set of}} data that includes monthly and annual information on small-business borrowers at an anonymous Canadian bank, the authors provide evidence that a bank has exclusive access to a continuous stream of borrower data, namely, the firm's <b>checking</b> <b>account</b> balances at the bank, that helps it to monitor the borrower.; To the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first direct empirical test of the usefulness of <b>checking</b> <b>account</b> information in monitoring commercial borrowers. The authors directly examine the mechanism through which a bank is able to gain an information advantage over other types of lenders and find evidence that <b>checking</b> <b>account</b> information is indeed relatively transparent for monitoring borrowers' collateral and that such monitoring is useful in detecting problems with loans. As such, the authors' data provide "smoking gun" evidence that banks are special. <b>Checking</b> <b>accounts...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Checking</b> <b>accounts</b> are the {{cornerstone}} of household financial management, with nine out of 10 Americans using them to deposit earnings, pay bills, manage money, and build an ongoing relationship with a financial institution. However, despite this widespread use, consumers often are unaware {{of the terms of}} their <b>checking</b> <b>account</b> agreements. For instance, Pew found that many consumers are unaware that account agreements restrict their options if they have a dispute with their financial institution. Pew's prior research on terms and conditions of <b>checking</b> <b>account</b> agreements revealed that limitations on dispute resolution, including mandatory binding arbitration clauses, are common. These clauses require consumers to submit all complaints against their financial institution to a third-party decision maker (called an "arbitrator") instead of to a court. Building on earlier research, this report studies the account agreements of the 100 largest retail banks and credit unions by deposit volume to determine the prevalence of mandatory bindingarbitration clauses and other dispute resolution terms. Of these, Pew was able to obtain 92 <b>checking</b> <b>account</b> agreements (85 banks and 7 credit unions). (See Appendix A for list of financial institutions.) The focus was only on what was disclosed in these agreements, not additional rules and procedures required by the private arbitration companies. Additionally, Pew commissioned a survey of 603 consumers to ascertain American attitudes toward mandatory binding arbitration in <b>checking</b> <b>accounts.</b> (See Appendix B for additional discussion of methodology. ...|$|R
