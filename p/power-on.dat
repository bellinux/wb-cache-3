5|$|The F-20's {{avionics}} suite was all-new {{and greatly}} improved over the earlier designs. The General Electric AN/APG-67 multi-mode radar was {{the heart of}} the sensor suite, offering a wide range of air-to-air and air-to-ground modes. The F-5's electro-mechanical navigation system was replaced with an all-electronic version based on a ring laser gyroscope. Time from <b>power-on</b> to being able to launch was greatly reduced as a result, to about 22 seconds, and Northrop boasted that the aircraft had the shortest scramble time of any contemporary aircraft. The cockpit of the F-5 was completely re-worked with a large head-up display (HUD) and two monochrome multi-function displays set high on the control panel, and the addition of a complete hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) control system. Many of the avionics promised to have reliability beyond that of any competing aircraft then in service.|$|E

25|$|DDR3 memory utilises serial {{presence}} detect. Serial presence detect (SPD) is {{a standardized}} way to automatically access {{information about a}} computer memory module, using a serial interface. It is typically used during the <b>power-on</b> self-test for automatic configuration of memory modules.|$|E
25|$|Preparing the Vampire for {{take-off}} {{would only}} require pilots to perform six vital actions: setting the trim to neutral, opening {{the high and}} low-pressure fuel cocks, activating the booster pump, setting the flaps, and retracting the air brakes. If laden with external fuel tanks or bombs, pilots would have to retract the undercarriage quite quickly upon leaving the ground, else increasing airflow as the aircraft picked up speed would prevent the undercarriage doors from closing. Landing procedure was similarly free of complexity: disengaging the wheel brakes, lowering the undercarriage, setting the flaps to fully down, and effecting the air brakes. Typically, <b>power-on</b> landings were conducted due to the slow response of the engine to throttle changes, while the wheel brakes had to be applied carefully {{in order to avoid}} locking the wheels; there was no anti-lock braking system present.|$|E
25|$|The C64 uses a {{somewhat}} complicated memory banking scheme; the normal <b>power-on</b> default {{is to have}} the BASIC ROM mapped in at $A000 and the screen editor/kernal ROM at $E000. Memory underneath the system ROMs can be written to, but not read back without swapping out the ROMs. $1 contains a register with control bits for enabling/disabling the system ROMS as well as the I/O area at $D000. Most software swaps out the BASIC ROM, less often the kernal as the user must then provide his own code for I/O and interrupt handling. The $D000 page contains the I/O registers at power on, it can either be swapped with the character ROM (normally invisible to the CPU) or else simply the bare RAM underneath. If the I/O registers are swapped out, it is also necessary to disable interrupts via a SEI instruction. Theoretically, if all ROMs and the I/O area are swapped out, the entire 64k of system RAM is accessible to software aside from $0/$1 and the color RAM at $D800. If the kernel ROM is swapped out, BASIC will be removed with it and {{it is not possible to}} have BASIC active without the kernel.|$|E
500|$|Two quite {{different}} kinds of neon lighting are in common use. Neon glow lamps are generally tiny, with most operating between 100 and 250 volts. [...] They {{have been widely used}} as <b>power-on</b> indicators and in circuit-testing equipment, but light-emitting diodes (LEDs) now dominate in those applications. These simple neon devices were the forerunners of plasma displays and plasma television screens. Neon signs typically operate at much higher voltages (2–15 kilovolts), and the luminous tubes are commonly meters long. The glass tubing is often formed into shapes and letters for signage as well as architectural and artistic applications.|$|E
500|$|Asus {{designed}} the Zenbooks with brushed aluminium chassis and high rigidity, rather than plastic, the usual laptop construction material. A pattern of concentric circles on the lids {{is said to}} represent ripples in water and represent the [...] "zen philosophy" [...] that designers wanted to portray when creating the laptops. Zenbooks have been generally well received due to their chassis design and appearance {{as well as the}} high quality screens used in later models. However, the touchpad software was found to be erratic, particularly on the early models [...] and some of the models received criticism for their high prices. Some models (such as the UX32) suffer from lockdown when the lithium polymer battery cell gets drained or discharged below its recommended threshold, for example if the device is left on and unattended. The result is that the charger will fail to recharge the battery even when plugged in, leaving the machine in a near-complete unresponsive off-state. The machine can often be revived by pressing the <b>power-on</b> key for 10 seconds, whereupon it will start recharging.|$|E
2500|$|Solid {{tantalum}} capacitors with crystallization {{are most}} likely to fail at <b>power-on.</b> It is believed that the voltage across the dielectric layer is the trigger mechanism for the breakdown and that the switch-on current pushes the collapse to a catastrophic failure. To prevent such sudden failures, manufacturers recommend: ...|$|E
2500|$|Extensive stall [...] {{and spin}} testing {{was carried out}} at Wizard Lake on 28 December 1982. Straight-ahead and turning power off stalls {{resulted}} in a stable mush condition. <b>Power-on</b> stalls from 30 degrees nose up resulted in a +15 degree nose up stable mush, with no wing drop tendency. A near-vertical pitch resulted in a clean stall, with a smooth pitch forward and recovery to level flight with no wing drop tendency.|$|E
2500|$|The National Transportation Safety Board stated on 18 September 2008 {{that the}} Cessna 162 was {{registered}} in the experimental category and was conducting a test flight when the accident occurred. The test sequence involved a series of stalls starting at [...] The aircraft entered an unintentional flat spin and was not under control at , {{at which point the}} test pilot bailed out of the aircraft. Cessna confirmed that the 162 entered a spin from cross-controlled, <b>power-on</b> stall, that the spin became flat and recovery was not possible. The company indicated that the testing was outside that required for LSA certification and that the accident will result in only small design changes. [...] The aircraft was equipped with a Ballistic Recovery Systems parachute, but it failed to deploy when activated.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the IBM PC, {{which uses}} 8 kB of system ROM for <b>power-on</b> {{self-test}} (POST) and basic input/output system (BIOS), the Mac ROM is significantly larger (64 kB) and holds key OS code. Much {{of the original}} Mac ROM was coded by Andy Hertzfeld, {{a member of the}} original Macintosh team. He was able to conserve precious ROM space by writing routines in assembly language code optimized with [...] "hacks," [...] or clever programming tricks. In addition to the ROM, he also coded the kernel, the Macintosh Toolbox, and some of the desktop accessories (DAs). The icons of the operating system, which represent folders and application software, were designed by Susan Kare, who later designed the icons for Microsoft Windows 3.0. Bruce Horn and Steve Capps wrote the Macintosh Finder, {{as well as a number}} of Macintosh system utilities.|$|E

Pressing the <b>power-on</b> key while booted is the same as selecting the Shut Down command in the Finder, and once a Quadra 605 has completed its shutdown process it will prompt the operator to manually turn it off.|$|E

5000|$|Medical devices test {{themselves}} to assure their continued safety. Normally {{there are two}} tests. A <b>power-on</b> self-test (POST) will perform a comprehensive test. Then, a periodic test will assure that the device has not become unsafe since the <b>power-on</b> self test. Safety-critical devices normally define a [...] "safety interval", {{a period of time}} too short for injury to occur. The self test of the most critical functions normally is completed at least once per safety interval. The periodic test is normally a subset of the <b>power-on</b> self test.|$|E

5000|$|Other {{commercial}} {{machines that}} used writable microcode include the Burroughs Small Systems (1970s and 1980s), the Xerox processors in their Lisp machines and Xerox Star workstations, the DEC VAX 8800 ("Nautilus") family, and the Symbolics L- and G-machines (1980s). Some DEC PDP-10 machines stored their microcode in SRAM chips (about 80 bits wide x 2 Kwords), which was typically loaded on <b>power-on</b> through some other front-end CPU. [...] Many more machines offered user-programmable writable control stores {{as an option}} (including the HP 2100, DEC PDP-11/60 and Varian Data Machines V-70 series minicomputers).The Mentec M11 and Mentec M1 stored its microcode in SRAM chips, loaded on <b>power-on</b> through another CPU.The Data General Eclipse MV/8000 ("Eagle") had a SRAM writable control store, loaded on <b>power-on</b> through another CPU.|$|E
5000|$|There were {{especially}} two terms used in {{claims in the}} 642 patents that required clarification. In both the district and circuit court, potential infringement centered on the definition of “synchronous”. In Fujitsu’s patent, {{the function of the}} alert beacon signal is described as “an intermittent <b>power-on</b> type mobile station for shift to a <b>power-on</b> state synchronously with a received timing of a beacon signal, with a fixed period of time after the beacon signal has been received being defined as a data receive-ready period”. [...] The district court construed the phrase [...] "shifting to a power on state synchronously with a received timing of a beacon signal" [...] to mean [...] "shifting to a <b>power-on</b> state {{at the same time a}} beacon signal is to be received.|$|E
