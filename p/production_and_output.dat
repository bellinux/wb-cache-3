The optimal grazing pressure is based on the expected utility maximization framework, and a stochastic linear response and plateau production function. Results show that uncertainty and food safety problems lead to lower stocking density, and lower profits. However, reducing the potential incidence of microbial shedding guarantees future profits to the enterprise, and continuity in production.

Both litter <b>production</b> <b>and</b> decomposition are functions of the site (e.g., wet versus dry; cold versus warm; nutrient rich versus nutrient poor) and the vegetation that occupies the site (e.g., conifer versus broadleaf). A site's forest floor is determined by its areal weight, depth, and nutrient content. Typically, forest floors are heaviest and deepest in boreal forests and mountain forests where decomposition rates are slow. In contrast, the lightest and thinnest forest floors usually occur in tropical rain forests where decomposition rates are rapid, except on white sands where nutrients could not be supplied from mineral weathering.|$|R

The authors make a first attempt to empirically estimate the relationship between hours worked and the expected opportunities of promotion using the British Household Panel Survey data set.

40|$|Aim of {{the current}} study is to {{investigate}} the impact of exchange rate movements on regional growth and inequalities across 26 NUTS- 2 level regions in Turkey over a period 2004 - 2011. In terms of methodology, spatial-panel methods such as fixed and random effect estimators alligned with spatial autoregressive and error models were adopted. As an outcome, {{it has been shown that}} depreciation of Turkish lira creates an increasing effect on aggregate growth while its impact on regions are quite mixed. The industrialized Western regions are worsely affected. In these regions, depreciations create an increase in the cost items of companies, discouraging the <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> growth. Controversially, relatively less developed regions in Eastern parts are positively affected from depreciations, probably due to their improved export performances, following a depreciation, driven by a decrease in exported-good prices and increased competitiveness in foreign markets.

40|$|The {{standard}} Keynesian view {{of fiscal}} policy holds that in short-run fiscal adjustments (expansions) reduce (stimulate) aggregate demand {{and due to}} sticky wages, prices or other market rigidities, these demand shifts affect the factors of <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>output.</b> These conventional predictions have been challenged by the observation of episodes of perverse effects of fiscal policy – so called “non-Keynesian” effects. This paper reassess the short-run consequences of fiscal policy. We provide evidence that consumption reacts in a non-linear fashion to discretionary fiscal policy changes. The results of our estimations show that households tend to behave in non-Keynesian manner when the fiscal situation of a country is bad, i. e. when public debt or fiscal deficit is large, while Keynesian behavior dominates, when the fiscal situation is sound. Our results suggest that, similarly to OECD countries, consumption function does not react in linear fashion to changes in fiscal policy also in transition economies. fiscal policy, Non-Keynesian effects...|$|E

First, we show that there exists a unique equilibrium in which, in contrast to previous results in the literature, <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> price depend on the distribution of the spot price and risk aversion, i. e., there is no separation when the firms have access to the futures market. Second, we study the effect of access to the futures market on entry, production, and prices. The effect of access to the futures market on the number of firms is ambiguous depending on the value of the futures price and the parameters of the model. We also show that hedging induces the risk-averse firm to produce more, while speculating reduces production...|$|E
40|$|A multinomial {{regression}} {{is used on}} {{data from}} a survey of French bean smallholders to analyse duration of business to farm business relations in horticulture farming conditional on incentives, transaction cost minimization and social capital. Average marginal effects return a higher probability of short duration given a higher number of farmer neighbours and farms located further from the village indicating dependence on social networks and avoidance of competition for farm supplies. The probability of long duration is higher if farmers have access to credit and prior information on prices, large farm area under beans and contractual experience, if selected to farm beans and if a farmer knows a higher number of farmers selling to the same buyer, if a farmer uses a supply contract and the farm is further from the source of irrigation water. This suggests that long duration exchanges are based on high powered incentives, transaction cost reduction, social capital and control of quality supplies. It is concluded {{that the success of}} production and market intervention programs in the smallholder sector will require buyers to exploit social networks, use <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> incentives and build on existing farmer expertise...|$|E

Cows were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three pre-grazing HM treatments: 1150 - Low HM (L), 1400 - Medium HM (M) or 2000 kg DM/ha - High HM (H). Herbage accumulation under grazing was lowest (P< 0. 01) on the L treatment and cows grazing the L pastures required more grass silage supplementation during the grazing season (+ 73 kg DM/cow) to overcome pasture deficits due to lower pasture growth rates (P< 0. 05). Treatment did not affect daily milk production or pasture intake, although cows grazing the L pastures had to graze a greater daily area (P< 0. 01) and increase grazing time (P< 0. 05) to compensate for a lower pre-grazing HM (P< 0. 01). The results indicate that, while pre-grazing HM did not influence daily milk yield per cow, adapting the practise of grazing low HM (1150 kg DM/ha) pasture reduces pasture DM production and at a system level may increase the requirement for imported feed...|$|E

5000|$|But {{there is}} also an {{ecological}} criticism that is sometimes made. The argument here is that, in calculating net <b>output,</b> costs <b>and</b> results are only assessed in price terms. Therefore, inputs to <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>outputs</b> which are not priced, are excluded in the valuation. Yet those inputs <b>and</b> <b>outputs</b> may nevertheless have an economic or human value, regardless of whether a price could be imputed to them or regardless of whether they can be made an object of trade. If the air is polluted, or depletion of fish stocks in the open seas occurs, the cost of repairing that is not accounted for in the net output of polluters or fishing companies. Sometimes tax levies are therefore imposed.

Others however argue it proves the ability of competitive markets to solve any problem of resource allocation.|$|R

For non-revenue-raising environmental mandates, what are the general equilibrium impacts on the wage, the return to capital, and relative output prices?

Also, a relative restriction on the amount of pollution per unit of output creates an "output-subsidy effect " on factor prices that can offset and reverse the traditional output effect and substitution effect.
