25|$|The age of vine {{can also}} {{contribute}} to how much grassy character the resultant wine may have {{as well as how}} early the grapes are harvested. Many of the phenolic compounds and aroma compounds, such as <b>pyrazine,</b> that contribute to strong grassy flavours are found in the grape skins, eventually breaking down as it goes through its ripening process. Grapes that are harvested before they are physiologically ripe may have more overt grassy notes. How the harvest is conducted will depend on where the vineyards are located. As the steep slopes on which many Sancerre vineyards are planted make mechanical harvesting difficult many vineyards are picked by hand. However, in the flatter vineyards located more towards the west of the appellation, mechanical harvesting is starting to become more prevalent.|$|E
25|$|In heterocyclic {{aromatics}} (heteroaromatics), {{one or more}} of {{the atoms}} in the aromatic ring is of an element other than carbon. This can lessen the ring's aromaticity, and thus (as in the case of furan) increase its reactivity. Other examples include pyridine, <b>pyrazine,</b> pyrrole, imidazole, pyrazole, oxazole, thiophene, and their benzannulated analogs (benzimidazole, for example). In all these examples, the number of π-electrons is 6, due to the π-electrons from the double bonds as well as the two electrons from any lone pair that is in the p-orbital that is in the plane of the aromatic π system. For example, in pyridine, the five sp2-hybridized carbons each have a p-orbital that is perpendicular to the plane of the ring, and each of these p-orbitals contains one π-electron. Additionally, the nitrogen atom is also sp2-hybridized and has one electron in a p-orbital, which adds up to 6 p-electrons, thus making pyridine aromatic. The lone pair on the nitrogen is not part of the aromatic π system. Pyrrole and imidazole are both five membered aromatic rings that contain heteroatoms. In pyrrole, each of the four sp2-hybridized carbons contributes one π-electron, and the nitrogen atom is also sp2-hybridized and contributes two π-electrons from its lone pair, which occupies a p-orbital. In imidazole, both nitrogens are sp2-hybridized; the one in the double bond contributes one electron and the one which is not in the double bond and is in a lone pair contributes two electrons to the π system.|$|E

30|$|<b>Pyrazines</b> are heterocyclic {{aromatic}} {{organic compounds}} containing nitrogen {{atoms in the}} 1 - and 4 -position of the aromatic ring. <b>Pyrazines</b> are found {{in a wide variety}} of foods processed during dry heating processes (Muller and Rappert 2010). They are also synthesized and degraded by microorganisms during their primary or secondary metabolism which occurs by Maillard reaction and Strecker’s degradation (Hwang et al. 1994; Shu 1999). It is generally known that <b>pyrazines</b> are not produced by enzymatic reactions in microorganisms, but are thought to arise from the non-enzymatic condensation between the precursors of amino acids (Koehler et al. 1969; Muller and Rappert 2010). The lower methyl and ethyl <b>pyrazines</b> were formed non-enzymatically by amination of acyloins leading to aminocarbonyl compounds followed by condensation (Rizzi 1988). Diverse alkylated <b>pyrazines</b> were formed by reaction of acyloins with methyl, ethyl, and propyl substitutions leading to different alkylated <b>pyrazines</b> (Rajini et al. 2011; Schulz and Dickschat 2007). They are responsible for different flavors according to the nature of the alkyl substituents. Therefore, the understanding synthesized <b>pyrazines</b> from microbial metabolism for finding key flavors is very important. However, analysis of <b>pyrazines</b> in food has been investigated actively, while few studies have been performed in analytical methods of <b>pyrazines</b> from microbial metabolism. Furthermore, <b>pyrazines</b> produced by microorganisms can be found in low quantities in culture media (Beck et al. 2003; Dickschat et al. 2010; Nawrath et al. 2010), and the bottleneck of analysis has been the difficulty of sample preparation due to the high solubility and volatility of <b>pyrazines</b> in microbial samples. Conventional techniques have been used previously such as headspace and purge and trap. Headspace extraction used for volatile analytes in solid or liquid samples is preferable technique for a quality control but the sensitivity is limited (Pawliszyn 2000). The purge and trap technique is more sensitive, while the complicated switching valves and ghost peaks caused by decomposition of the trapping materials during thermal desorption are main disadvantages. Recently, SPME which was invented by Pawliszyn in 1989 has been applied to analysis in various fields, such as environmental chemistry, forensic chemistry, pharmaceutical, food, beverage, and flavors (Pawliszyn 2000; Theodoridis et al. 2000). The advantages of SPME over the previous techniques are that it is a very simple and efficient sample preparation method as sampling, extraction, and concentration can be combined into a single solvent-free step. Other advantages of SPME are that it can use small sample volumes (Risticevic et al. 2010). As a diffusion micro sampling tool, solid porous coating fibers can adsorb analytes from a sample by immersion or headspace extraction. Generally, direct immersion is not suitable for complex media and may damage fiber in direct contact with dirty matrix (Pawliszyn 2000). For these reasons, headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) was adopted to determine volatile alkylpyrazines (VAPs) in microbial samples as a sampling technique in this study. Meanwhile, the nitrogen–phosphorus detector (NPD) or flame ionization detector (FID) has been used to detect VAPs but various types of mass spectrometric detectors have been employed increasingly due to the availability for identification and quantification of VAPs (Harris et al. 1987; Sala et al. 2002; Clery et al. 2006).|$|R
500|$|There are {{a couple}} of noted Cabernet Sauvignon flavors that are intimately tied to viticultural and climate influences. The most widely {{recognized}} is the herbaceous or green bell pepper flavor caused by pyrazines, which are more prevalent in underripened grapes. <b>Pyrazine</b> compounds are [...] present in all Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and are gradually destroyed by sunlight as the grape continues to ripen. To the human palate this compound is detectable in wines with <b>pyrazine</b> levels as low as [...] 2 nanograms (ng) per liter. At the time of veraison, when the grapes first start to fully ripen, there is the equivalent <b>pyrazine</b> level of 30ng/l. In cooler climates, it is difficult to get Cabernet Sauvignon grapes to ripen fully to the point where <b>pyrazine</b> is not detected. The green bell pepper flavor is not considered a wine fault {{but it may not be}} desirable to all consumers' tastes. The California wine region of Monterey was noted in the late 20th century for its very vegetal Cabernet Sauvignon with pronounced green pepper flavor, earning the nickname of [...] "Monterey veggies". In addition to its cool climate, Monterey is also prone to being very windy, which can have the effect of shutting down the grape vines and further inhibiting ripeness.|$|E

Mechanisms to explain these effects are also proposed in the present work, and the high content of polyphenols seems to be the major cause of the observed results.

40|$|The Maillard {{reaction}} {{is the major}} route for thermal generation of flavor; {{it is a very}} complex cascade of interdependent chemical reactions that has been the topic of many research papers since it was first identified by Louis Camille Maillard in 1912. The aromas in most thermally processed foods, such as bread, cereal products, roasted peanuts, and roasted coffee, are largely due to the Maillard reaction. Currently, more than 2500 different flavor compounds have been identified. Among these Maillard–type flavors, heterocyclic compounds with desirable aromas and low odor thresholds make the most significant contribution. <b>Pyrazines</b> are specific Maillard reaction products known to contribute to the unique roasted, nutty, meaty, earthy, popcorn-like aroma of many heated foods. The generation of <b>pyrazines</b> has been studied extensively in model systems between free amino acids and sugars and studied less in more complex model systems. Nevertheless, in general, food products are known to contain small amounts of free amino acids.

Major volatile flavour compounds identified in roasted coffee beans are <b>pyrazines.</b> Since the roasting process significantly affects these volatile compounds, the roasting conditions need to be optimised in ensuring the quality of roasted coffee beans. In this study, the roasting temperature and roasting time for Indonesian Arabica and Robusta coffee beans were optimised based on the concentration of selected <b>pyrazines</b> (2 -methylpyrazine, 2, 3 dimethylpyrazine, 2 ~ 5 -dimethylpyrazine, 2 ~ 3, 5 -trimethylpyrazine and 2, 3, 5, 6 tetramethylpyrazine) using response surface methodology (RSM), supported by overall sensory evaluation by an expert panelist and trained panelists. Since undesirable acrylamide {{is known to be}} produced during roasting process, minimising the amount of acrylamide was also considered in the optimisation of roasting process. <b>Pyrazines</b> were extracted using solid phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatgraphy with flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) while acrylamide was analysed using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and GC-FID. Optimised conditions for roasting coffee beans were obtained at roasting temperature of 167 °C for 22 minutes for Arabica coffee beans and roasting temperature of 167 °C for 27 minutes for Robusta coffee beans. The optimised conditions were applied in roasting coffee beans samples from different varieties (Arabica and Robusta) and origins (Asia, Africa and America) and the dataset on the amount of <b>pyrazines</b> was subjected to multivariate analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) was able to discriminate between Arabica and Robusta coffee beans with total variance of 91. 94 %, supported by hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) showing two distinct clusters and discriminant analysis (DA) with 1000 / 0 correct classification.

The chemical structure of the <b>pyrazines</b> was encoded by five theoretical descriptors, namely the sum of electrotopological indices, the number of carbon atoms of the substituent R 2, the charge on the first atom of the substituent R 4 computed with an ab initio method (Hartee-Fock with a 3 - 21 G basis set), and the molecular surface of the substituents R 1 and R 3. Three sets of SVM experiments were performed for the classification of <b>pyrazines,</b> each one considering the classification of one class of compounds against the compounds from the remaining two classes. The SVM models were computed with the dot, polynomial, radial basis function, neural, and anova kernels. The leave- 10 %-out cross-validation results represent the main criterion for selecting the best SVM model that has the highest prediction power. The results obtained demonstrate that the SVM classification of <b>pyrazines</b> in aroma classes depends strongly on the kernel type and various parameters that control the kernel shape. In general, the neural kernel gives the worst results. The best predictions were obtained with the polynomial kernel of degree 2 for the green and bell-pepper classes, and with the anova kernel (γ = 0. 5 and d = 1) for the nutty <b>pyrazines.</b> The classification of chemical compounds in odor classes with SOR models can be efficiently made with support vector machines. The solution of the SVM model is a unique hyperplane that guarantees a maximum separation between two classes of chemical compounds.
