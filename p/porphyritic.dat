5|$|The {{field has}} erupted andesite. Such a {{limited range of}} {{composition}} is typical for Austral Volcanic Zone volcanoes, which only feature andesite and dacite. Lava domes feature columnar joints. The surface texture of the rocks is trachytic to <b>porphyritic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Potbelly monuments are {{generally}} crude in-the-round sculptures of extremely fat human figures; {{they are usually}} seated cross-legged and have enormous swollen stomachs gripped in the figure's arms and legs. The heads are round and normally have the eyes closed and possess puffy eyelids and prominent lips. The monuments {{are generally}} of indeterminate gender and are usually carved from <b>porphyritic</b> basalt, a kind of rock {{with a combination of}} large and small grains of mineral that is common along the foothills of Central America. There are occasional examples of potbelly figures crafted from other materials, such as pottery or from other types of rock.|$|E
5|$|Rocks have a <b>porphyritic</b> texture. Basaltic andesites {{typically}} contain {{less than}} 10% crystals while dacites generally {{have more than}} 20% crystals. The Alconcha group lavas of the first one million years are crystal-poor and lack biotite; later lavas contain biotite and more crystals. Based on geothermometric data, the highest temperatures occurred during phases of high activity and lower temperatures are associated with low output periods. It is likely that crustal feedback and increased deep crustal influx of mantle-derived basalts drive increased magmatic flux. During {{the time of the}} Polan eruption on the west flank, magma output was spatially segregated with the peripheral Miño Volcano generating andesite lavas and the more central volcanos generating dacites.|$|E
5|$|Level Mountain basalt and {{andesite}} flows {{were presented}} in the 1926 Canada Department of Mines Summary Report, 1925, Part A. The andesites were described as <b>porphyritic</b> rocks with phenocrysts of feldspar of various size in a greyish or greenish matrix. Both hornblende and augite andesites were noted to have been represented under a microscope. The basalts were described as black rocks with basic plagioclase with or without olivine and were noted in many cases to contain a considerable percentage of brownish glass. Although there was not sufficient time available to study these flows in detail it was revealed at several points that the andesites formed the older and the basalts the younger flows. G. M. Dawson of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) was able to demonstrate that on the Stikine River {{there were at least}} four flows of basalt. The basalts and andesites were considered to be younger than all the rocks they were observed in contact with, namely granitic intrusives, porphyries and greenstones. More definite evidence as to their age was obtained by W. A. Johnston and F. A. Kerr of the GSC who placed them in the Tertiary {{with some of the most}} recent flows of the Stikine valley probably belonging to the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|The rocks {{follow the}} calc-alkaline trend of magmatic differentiation, {{containing}} silicic lavas such as dacite. Their overall composition ranges from basaltic andesite to dacite, and the dominant lava rocks are andesite and basalt. Andesites range from green to gray in colour, and dacites are pink- and light-gray. The andesitic lavas contain phenocrysts of andesine, hornblende, plagioclase and hypersthene. Dacites have biotite, hornblende, plagioclase and quartz phenocrysts. Textures range from <b>porphyritic</b> to vitreophyritic. Andesites {{are more common}} in Pliocene rocks, and Pleistocene rocks tend to be dacitic. At least five cycles of andesite rock formation have been found on the southwest side of Koh-i-Sultan. Its rocks are typical volcanic-arc rocks in elemental chemistry, and may stem from mantle-derived magma. The satellite centre rocks differ from the main centre rocks in composition, suggesting that different processes generated the magmas which constructed the cones. There is a compositional trend from Bazman over Taftan to Sultan, with the latter having more potassium in its rocks than the other centres. Such compositional trends may come from different partial melting ratios and different fluid contributions to magma generation at each volcano.|$|E
5|$|The {{sapphire}} bearing Yogo dike is a {{dark gray}} to green intrusive rock known as a lamprophyre. The lamprophyre is an unusual igneous rock that contains a low content of silica. The rock has a <b>porphyritic</b> texture with large crystals of orthopyroxene and phlogopite set in a fine grained matrix. The phlogopite crystals {{have been used to}} determine the age of the dike and its crystallization temperature (900°C (1,650°F)). The dike also contains fragments of other rock types. These xenoliths include pieces of limestone, clastic sedimentary rocks, and gneiss. In some locations, due to the abundance of xenoliths, the dike has the appearance of a limestone breccia in an igneous matrix. One gneiss fragment found as a xenolith contains corundum. The Yogo sapphires themselves are rimmed with a reaction layer of spinel and are etched, indicating that the sapphires were not in chemical equilibrium with their host, the lamprophyre magma. This suggests the sapphire crystals may have originated in an earlier rock, such as a corundum-bearing gneiss, later assimilated by the lamprophyre magma at depth. Earlier investigators had assumed that the sapphire had crystallized from the magma with the necessary high aluminium content provided by assimilation of clay rich shales of the Proterozoic Belt Supergroup sediments which are known to be present at depth in the region.|$|E
25|$|Association of {{the fine}} grained charnockite and the <b>porphyritic</b> biotite {{hornblende}} granite suggest common age (Omotoyinbo,1994).|$|E
25|$|The park {{contains}} {{a set of}} rocks of <b>porphyritic</b> granite composition, with traces of gneisses and quartzites.|$|E
25|$|The Pebble deposit is hosted in <b>porphyritic</b> {{granodiorite}} to tonalite of Upper Cretaceous age intruded into deformed {{sedimentary rocks}} of the Jurassic to Cretaceous Kahiltna flysch terrane.|$|E
25|$|A coarse <b>porphyritic</b> micro-adamellite was intruded {{sometime}} {{from late}} Silurian to early Devonian. It intrudes the Hawkins Volcanics in Belconnen in Flynn, Melba, McKellar, the Town Center and Bruce.|$|E
25|$|The {{summit is}} covered by peat, {{overlying}} the plagioclase-phyric andesite lavas of the Birker Fell Formation. There is a small bed of volcaniclastic sandstone to the south while the northern slopes are predominantly garnet-bearing <b>porphyritic</b> andesite.|$|E
25|$|Raven Crag and the Benn exhibit rock of the Birker Fell Formation, {{composed}} of plagioclase-phyric andesite lavas with subordinate sills. Between {{the two is}} an area of garnet bearing <b>porphyritic</b> andesite. Castle Crag Fort overlays volcaniclastic sandstone.|$|E
25|$|An {{igneous rock}} with larger, clearly {{discernible}} crystals {{embedded in a}} finer-grained matrix is termed porphyry. <b>Porphyritic</b> texture develops {{when some of the}} crystals grow to considerable size before the main mass of the magma crystallizes as finer-grained, uniform material.|$|E
25|$|The caldera is in two parts, an {{overlying}} volcanic edifice composed {{primarily of}} <b>porphyritic</b> rhyolite and dacite with occasional vent complex agglomerates, which shows prominent circular ring-complex faults, and the Winburn Granite which underlies the caldera and is primarily exposed {{in the east}} as a pink, potassium-feldspathic porphyry granite, the lower margins of which are weakly tectonised.|$|E
25|$|The next layer, the South Oromocto Andesite formation, is {{composed}} {{of at least three}} flow units, with basalt flows being the most extensive. Only one exhibits a <b>porphyritic</b> texture. Calcite veins and hematite bands {{near the top of the}} layer indicate that this was a period of degassing in the flow. It forms a thin band around the Rothea formation.|$|E
25|$|On {{the western}} edge of the Yilgarn Craton, {{partially}} covered by Phanerozoic sedimentary basins and in faulted contact with the 2.7 Ga to 2.55 Ga Yilgarn tectonic domains, lies the Jumperding Gneiss Complex of 2.75 to 2.65 Ga age, composed primarily of micaceous quartzite, quartz-feldspar-biotite-garnet gneiss, andalusite and sillimanite schists, banded iron formation and other exotics, intruded by minor masses of <b>porphyritic</b> granite.|$|E
25|$|The McDougall Brook Granite {{formation}} consists {{mostly of}} <b>porphyritic</b> granite, a borderline feldspar (sometimes quartz) porphyry, and minor amounts of fine-grained quartz monzonite. The grain {{size of the}} porphyry and the size and abundance of feldspar increases inward. Amphibole with apatite is the main mineral phase in {{all three of the}} flows. Parts of the feldspar porphyry are hydrothermally altered. The deposit is extensively exposed, and is colored red on the map.|$|E
25|$|Also in the Pliocene, basaltic flows {{erupted from}} vents and {{fissures}} {{in the southern}} part of the park. These and later flows covered increasingly large areas and built a lava plateau. In the later Pliocene and into the Pleistocene, these basaltic flows were covered by successive thick and fluid flows of andesite lava, which geologists call the Juniper lavas and the Twin Lakes lavas. The Twin Lakes lava is black, <b>porphyritic</b> and has abundant xenocrysts of quartz (see Cinder Cone).|$|E
25|$|The last {{formation}} in the later, the Bailey Rock Rhyolite formation, is composed of <b>porphyritic</b> lava, and is characterized by an absence of angular crystals and pumice derivatives. In places its rhyolite composition intrudes older stratas. This layer is unique for it bridges the exocaldera and intracaldera sequences. A layer of saprolite (chemically weathered rock) separates the Bailey Rock Rhyolite formation from the overlying Caldera-Fill Sequence-era rocks. The exposed part of the flow overlies part of the Carrow formation, and is colored pink in the diagram above-right.|$|E
25|$|As a {{secondary}} mineral, turquoise forms by {{the action of}} percolating acidic aqueous solutions during the weathering and oxidation of preexisting minerals. For example, the copper may come from primary copper sulfides such as chalcopyrite or from the secondary carbonates malachite or azurite; the aluminium may derive from feldspar; and the phosphorus from apatite. Climate factors appear {{to play an important role}} as turquoise is typically found in arid regions, filling or encrusting cavities and fractures in typically highly altered volcanic rocks, often with associated limonite and other iron oxides. In the Southwestern United States turquoise is almost invariably associated with the weathering products of copper sulfide deposits in or around potassium-feldspar-bearing <b>porphyritic</b> intrusives. In some occurrences alunite, potassium aluminium sulfate, is a prominent secondary mineral. Typically turquoise mineralization is restricted to a relatively shallow depth of less than , although it does occur along deeper fracture zones where secondary solutions have greater penetration or the depth to the water table is greater.|$|E
25|$|The Intercaldera Sequence {{comprises}} formations that crop {{out from}} overlying flows in triangularly shaped area, and includes thick volcanic ash (tuff), thick breccia layers, and intermediate to felsic igneous rocks {{that tend to}} intrude the above layers and are typically located along caldera margin faults. The Exocaldera Sequence contains ash flow tuffs, mafic lavas, alluvial redbeds, and <b>porphyritic</b> felsic lavas that are distributed across five different layers. The late Caldera-Fill Sequence contains rocks {{that are similar to}} those of the outflows of the other, older layers, and comprises two formations and two relatively minor intrusive lava flows. The volcanic flows are generally mafic. The stratigraphic subdivision is supported by geochemical and mineralogical analyses, which indicate that the basaltic rocks are mantle-derived and have, unusually, relatively intraplate (or hotspot) type chemical affinities. The multiple andesite flows were probably derived from basaltic magma by the crystallization of the magma material. The relatively rare, more felsic flow units, are thought to have originated from high-end crystallization inside the magma chamber. The various stages of fractionation are continually interrupted by eruptions, and have allowed scientists to recognize seven stages of caldera development. The genesis of the caldera is related to a period of lithospheric thinning that followed the Acadian Orogeny in the northern Appalachians.|$|E
500|$|After the basal trachytes were erupted, the {{explosive}} phase produced alkali-feldspar <b>porphyritic</b> trachytes, which erupted as pyroclastic deposits with minor, small lava flows and domes. The explosive eruptions produced pumice flows, bedded tuffs, debris flows, reworked polymict debris flows and lava flows less than [...] thick. The <b>porphyritic</b> trachytes erupted {{at the summit}} of the shield and flowed towards the northeast and east. Because the <b>porphyritic</b> pyroclastic deposits are buried by younger volcanic rocks and glacial drift deposits, the maximum thickness of them is unknown.|$|E
500|$|Lastarria is {{composed}} of andesite–dacite, both rich in potassium and characteristic of calc-alkaline magmas of the Central Volcanic Zone. The appearance of Lastarria lavas is <b>porphyritic.</b> Some rocks display [...] "banding" [...] features, implicating the mixing of different magmas during their formation.|$|E
500|$|The lavas of Taftan are <b>porphyritic.</b> Mineral {{components}} include biotite, clinopyroxene, hornblende, orthopyroxene, plagioclase and quartz. Other {{components are}} chalcopyrite, haematite, ilmenite, magnetite and pyrite. Complex phenocryst assemblages {{found in a}} sample indicate that the magma formation is a complex process. Taftan rocks overall are -rich calc-alkaline, of sub–alkaline affinity. The magma that formed these rocks was influenced by crystal fractionation and mixing processes. Its composition has characteristics of volcanic arc magmas. Crustal materials {{were involved in the}} formation of the magma, with [...] isotope data indicating crustal assimilation.|$|E
500|$|Llullaillaco {{has mostly}} erupted dacites with medium {{potassium}} content, with rocks becoming more felsic the younger they are. Rock samples taken from Llullaillaco are mostly <b>porphyritic</b> or vitrophyric, with a glassy or microcrystalline matrix. Phenocrysts are mostly plagioclase, with mafic phenocrysts being dominated by orthopyroxene and smaller amounts of biotite, clinopyroxene, and hornblende. Ilmenite, magnetite, and sulfide minerals are also present, magnetite {{especially in the}} more oxidized older lavas. Some phenocrysts show evidence of a complex history. Quartz is rare. Older lavas have developed a red colour and contain oxidized iron in form of hematite. Lavas from Llullaillaco I are grey. The content of [...] is 65–67%.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{within the}} park {{boundary}} other volcanic events were taking place. Basaltic lavas poured forth {{in the vicinity of}} Willow Lake in the southwestern portion of the park. These were followed by a very thick sequence of very fluid andesitic lavas which erupted near Juniper Lake and flowed westward about four miles (6km). At about the same time, other andesitic lavas poured from several vents on the central plateau to cover an area of at least [...] Included among these flows were the Twin Lake lavas of black <b>porphyritic</b> andesite, which are notable in that they contain xenocrysts of quartz. The Flatiron andesites spread over the southwestern part of the park area around this time. Apparently, the vents of these lavas renewed activity at a much later date to form three cinder cones: Hat Mountain, Crater Butte and Fairfield Peak.|$|E
500|$|The Campo de la Piedra Pómez ignimbrites (...) have {{a surface}} area of [...] They have a volume of [...] and are {{separated}} in two layers which form one cooling unit despite their different colour and mineral composition. They both contain pumice and lithic fragments and are poor in crystals. Both have a pyroclastic texture with pumices bearing a <b>porphyritic</b> texture. Dating techniques yield different ages; the most reliable one (argon–argon dating on sanidine) indicates that these ignimbrites were erupted 73,000 ± 23,200 years ago. Other proposed dates go {{as far back as}} 0.555 ± 0.11 mya. They do not cross topographic surfaces and were generated by tranquil release from the ground rather than through the collapse of an eruption column. The surface has been exposed to wind erosion, forming yardangs and ripple marks. The source of this eruption is unknown; the Robledo caldera may be the origin of this eruption but this is controversial. The ignimbrites of Piedra Pómez are covered with a desert varnish similar coating, some bearing signs of endolithic lifeforms.|$|E
500|$|The felsic shield-building stage {{ended with}} the post-explosive phase. This phase of {{activity}} created small volcanic plugs, lava flows, minor pyroclastic flows, channelized debris flows and a few glassy dikes at {{the summit of the}} shield volcano. These consist of alkali-feldspar <b>porphyritic</b> quartz-trachyte and trachyte. Alkali-feldspar quartz-trachyte plugs formed in rhyolites and trachytes of the pre-explosive phase, as well as pyroclastic deposits and feldspar trachyte lava flows of the explosive phase. Later activity produced trachyte and phonolite plugs and lava flows. This volcanism occurred mainly at the shield's summit and on its western flank. Massive lava flows from this volcanic activity have a thickness of about [...] while three successive lava flows at the summit have a combined thickness of more than [...] Lava from the western flank flowed over basement rocks and trachytes of the pre-explosive phase. In contrast, lava from the summit flowed over pyroclastic rocks and lava flows of the explosive phase. Mount Downton and Itcha Mountain were formed during this eruptive period. The final volcanic event of the post-explosive phase produced [...] thick trachyte lava flows on the western flank.|$|E
500|$|The Tuzgle volcano proper is {{constructed}} from an older rhyodacite-mafic series {{and a more}} recent series constructed from andesites alone. These and neighbouring shoshonitic centres are formed from magmas with crustal contamination. Isotope analysis of magmatic rocks have shown La/Nb ratios of 1.31.6 and Ba/Ta ratios of 160260, lower than in the main volcanic front. The overall chemical composition is potassium-rich calc-alkaline. Thermobarometry indicates that the older magmas crystallized at pressures of [...] while younger ones crystallized at [...] and temperatures of about [...] These magma compositions indicate that the magmas {{are the result of}} complex mixing processes and also involve the transitional nature of the mantle beneath Tuzgle, where the more northern steep slab encounters the shallower southern subducting slab. Crystal fractionation and melting of upper crustal rocks further complicate the pattern. The lava domes which were erupted from the ground after the Tuzgle ignimbrite have volumes of , while the Platform and subsequent units have volumes of [...] The lava domes and San Antonio lava flows have <b>porphyritic</b> surfaces. San Antonio lavas contain large plagioclase xenocrystals and xenoliths. The ignimbrite contains Ordovician lithic fragments and 1020% pumice. Its eruption was presumably linked to high mantle melt rates; the resulting mafic magmas induced the generation of large amounts of silicic melts. Lower mantle melt rates would form mafic melts that incorporate silicic melts before erupting.|$|E

Middle and Upper Pleistocene lavas form {{the upper part of the}} volcanoes and extend up to [...] away. According to geological inspection involving both aerial surveys and field work, the longest lava flows appear to generate from the central vent.

It was based on native sulfur and minor realgar in the volcanic ash, with an estimated [...] of ore. A road was reported to have existed in 1948-1950, leading from Uyuni over Quetena to Uturunku. Laguna Celeste lies at the foot of the volcano and is fed by snow melt from the volcano's northeastern side. Mama Khumu, a lake on the eastern side of the volcano, is also fed from the volcano.
