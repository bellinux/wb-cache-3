5|$|Protactinium(V) {{fluoride}} and protactinium(V) chloride have a <b>polymeric</b> {{structure of}} monoclinic symmetry. There, within one <b>polymeric</b> chain, all the halide atoms lie in one graphite-like plane and form planar pentagons around the protactinium ions. The coordination 7 of protactinium originates from the 5 halide atoms and two bonds to protactinium atoms {{belonging to the}} nearby chains. These compounds easily hydrolyze in water. The pentachloride melts at 300°C and sublimates at even lower temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium {{adopts a}} <b>polymeric</b> {{structure}} consisting of zig-zag chains of Te atoms. This gray material resists oxidation by air {{and is not}} volatile.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of silicon is generally nonmetallic (covalent) in nature. It {{is not known}} to form a cation. Silicon can form alloys with metals such as iron and copper. It shows fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions. The high strength of the silicon-oxygen bond dominates the chemical behaviour of silicon. <b>Polymeric</b> silicates, built up by tetrahedral SiO4 units sharing their oxygen atoms, are the most abundant and important compounds of silicon. The <b>polymeric</b> borates, comprising linked trigonal and tetrahedral BO3 or BO4 units, are built on similar structural principles. The oxide SiO2 is <b>polymeric</b> in structure, weakly acidic, and a glass former. Traditional organometallic chemistry includes the carbon compounds of silicon (see organosilicon).|$|E
5|$|The {{intermetallic}} compounds of the alkali metals with the heavier group 13 elements (aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium), such as NaTl, are poor conductors or semiconductors, unlike the normal alloys with the preceding elements, {{implying that the}} alkali metal involved has lost an electron to the Zintl anions involved. Nevertheless, while the elements in group 14 and beyond tend to form discrete anionic clusters, group 13 elements tend to form <b>polymeric</b> ions with the alkali metal cations located between the giant ionic lattice. For example, NaTl consists of a <b>polymeric</b> anion (—Tl−—)n with a covalent diamond cubic structure with Na+ ions located between the anionic lattice. The larger alkali metals cannot fit similarly into an anionic lattice and tend to force the heavier group 13 elements to form anionic clusters.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} oxide is TiO2, which exists in three important polymorphs; anatase, brookite, and rutile. All {{of these are}} white diamagnetic solids, although mineral samples can appear dark (see rutile). They adopt <b>polymeric</b> structures in which Ti is surrounded by six oxide ligands that link to other Ti centers.|$|E
5|$|Glycocalyx is {{produced}} by many bacteria to surround their cells, and varies in structural complexity: ranging from a disorganised slime layer of extracellular <b>polymeric</b> substances to a highly structured capsule. These structures can protect cells from engulfment by eukaryotic cells such as macrophages (part of the human immune system). They can also act as antigens and be involved in cell recognition, as well as aiding attachment to surfaces {{and the formation of}} biofilms.|$|E
5|$|Samarium forms a cyclopentadienide Sm(C5H5)3 and its chloroderivatives Sm(C5H5)2Cl and Sm(C5H5)Cl2. They are {{prepared}} by reacting samarium trichloride with NaC5H5 in tetrahydrofuran. Contrary to cyclopentadienides {{of most other}} lanthanides, in Sm(C5H5)3 some C5H5 rings bridge each other by forming ring vertexes η1 or edges η2 toward another neighboring samarium atom, thereby creating <b>polymeric</b> chains. The chloroderivative Sm(C5H5)2Cl has a dimer structure, which is more accurately expressed as (η5-C5H5)2Sm(µ-Cl)2(η5-C5H5)2. There, the chlorine bridges can be replaced, for instance, by iodine, hydrogen or nitrogen atoms or by CN groups.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to safety}} {{concerns}} with viral vectors, nonviral delivery methods, typically employing lipid-based or <b>polymeric</b> vectors, are also promising candidates. Computational modeling of nonviral siRNA delivery paired with in vitro and in vivo gene knockdown studies elucidated the temporal behavior of RNAi in these systems. The model used an input bolus dose of siRNA and computationally and experimentally showed that knockdown duration was dependent {{mainly on the}} doubling time of the cells to which siRNA was delivered, while peak knockdown depended primarily on the delivered dose. Kinetic considerations of RNAi are imperative to safe and effective dosing schedules as nonviral methods of inducing RNAi continue to be developed.|$|E
5|$|In {{hydrides}} and nitrides, protactinium {{has a low}} {{oxidation state}} of about +3. The hydride is obtained by direct action of hydrogen on the metal at 250°C, and the nitride {{is a product of}} ammonia and protactinium tetrachloride or pentachloride. This bright yellow solid is stable to heating to 800°C in vacuum. Protactinium carbide PaC is formed by reduction of protactinium tetrafluoride with barium in a carbon crucible at a temperature of about 1400°C. Protactinium forms borohydrides which include Pa(BH4)4. It has an unusual <b>polymeric</b> structure with helical chains where the protactinium atom has coordination number of 12 and is surrounded by six BH4− ions.|$|E
5|$|Mycena purpureofusca {{has been}} {{investigated}} for its potential to decolorize industrial dyes. These dyes, used in textile dyeing and printing processes, are difficult to degrade due to their highly structured organic compounds and pose a major environmental threat. The fungus mycelium produces high levels of laccase, an oxidoreductase enzyme. Laccases are widely used in biotechnology and industry due {{to their ability to}} break down various recalcitrant compounds. M.purpureofusca laccase efficiently breaks down Remazol Brilliant Blue R, an industrially important dye that is frequently used as a starting material in the production of <b>polymeric</b> dyes.|$|E
5|$|Selenium forms several allotropes that interconvert with {{temperature}} changes, depending somewhat on {{the rate}} of temperature change. When prepared in chemical reactions, selenium is usually an amorphous, brick-red powder. When rapidly melted, it forms the black, vitreous form, usually sold commercially as beads. The structure of black selenium is irregular and complex and consists of <b>polymeric</b> rings with up to 1000 atoms per ring. Black Se is a brittle, lustrous solid that is slightly soluble in CS2. Upon heating, it softens at 50°C and converts to gray selenium at 180°C; the transformation temperature is reduced by presence of halogens and amines.|$|E
5|$|The highest known {{ruthenium}} halide is the hexafluoride, a {{dark brown}} solid that melts at 54°C. It hydrolyzes violently upon contact {{with water and}} easily disproportionates to form a mixture of lower ruthenium fluorides, releasing fluorine gas. Ruthenium pentafluoride is a tetrameric dark green solid that is also readily hydrolyzed, melting at 86.5°C. The yellow ruthenium tetrafluoride is probably also <b>polymeric</b> and can be formed by reducing the pentafluoride with iodine. Among the binary compounds of ruthenium, these high oxidation states are known only in the oxides and fluorides.|$|E
25|$|RAFT {{has also}} been used to graft polymer chains onto <b>polymeric</b> surfaces, for example, <b>polymeric</b> microspheres.|$|E
25|$|Particle {{settling}} is {{hindered by}} the stiffness of the <b>polymeric</b> matrix where particles are trapped. In addition, the long <b>polymeric</b> chains {{can provide a}} steric or electrosteric stabilization to dispersed particles.|$|E
25|$|RAFT pre-equilibrium: A <b>polymeric</b> radical with n monomer units (Pn) {{reacts with}} the RAFT agent {{to form a}} RAFT adduct radical. This may undergo a {{fragmentation}} reaction in either direction to yield either the starting species or a radical (R•) and a <b>polymeric</b> RAFT agent (S=C(Z)S-Pn). This is a reversible step in which the intermediate RAFT adduct radical is capable of losing either the R group (R•) or the <b>polymeric</b> species (Pn•).|$|E
25|$|Geofoam is {{a product}} created by a <b>polymeric</b> {{expansion}} process of polystyrene resulting in a “foam” consisting of many closed, but gas-filled, cells. The skeletal nature of the cell walls is the unexpanded <b>polymeric</b> material. The resulting product is generally {{in the form of}} large, but extremely light, blocks which are stacked side-by-side providing lightweight fill in numerous applications.|$|E
25|$|Novel non-viral vectors for {{osteoarthritis}} {{gene delivery}} including <b>polymeric</b> vectors {{are still under}} investigations.|$|E
25|$|The exposed {{lifetime}} of geosynthetics, being <b>polymeric,</b> {{is less than}} unexposed as when they are soil backfilled.|$|E
25|$|This was {{demonstrated}} experimentally {{in the study}} of various biological, <b>polymeric</b> and model systems at D-band EPR.|$|E

25|$|Total world {{production}} of MDI and <b>polymeric</b> MDI is over 6 million {{tonnes per year}} (Mt/a in 2016).|$|E
25|$|The high {{prevalence}} of IgA in mucosal areas {{is a result}} of a cooperation between plasma cells that produce <b>polymeric</b> IgA (pIgA), and mucosal epithelial cells that express an immunoglobulin receptor called the <b>polymeric</b> Ig receptor (pIgR). pIgA is released from the nearby activated plasma cells and binds to pIgR. This results in transportation of IgA across mucosal epithelial cells and its cleavage from pIgR for release into external secretions.|$|E
25|$|In general, <b>polymeric</b> {{mixtures}} are {{far less}} miscible than mixtures of small molecule materials. This effect results {{from the fact that}} the driving force for mixing is usually entropy, not interaction energy. In other words, miscible materials usually form a solution not because their interaction with each other is more favorable than their self-interaction, but because of an increase in entropy and hence free energy associated with increasing the amount of volume available to each component. This increase in entropy scales with the number of particles (or moles) being mixed. Since <b>polymeric</b> molecules are much larger and hence generally have much higher specific volumes than small molecules, the number of molecules involved in a <b>polymeric</b> mixture is far smaller than the number in a small molecule mixture of equal volume. The energetics of mixing, on the other hand, is comparable on a per volume basis for <b>polymeric</b> and small molecule mixtures. This tends to increase the free energy of mixing for polymer solutions and thus make solvation less favorable. Thus, concentrated solutions of polymers are far rarer than those of small molecules.|$|E
25|$|This is {{obtained}} by washing quenched liquid sulfur with CS2. It {{is sometimes called}} <b>polymeric</b> sulfur, μ-S or ω-S.|$|E
25|$|In July 2008, Erokhin and Fontana {{claimed to}} have {{developed}} a <b>polymeric</b> memristor before the more recently announced titanium dioxide memristor.|$|E
25|$|Both {{polymers}} and metals can creep. Polymers experience significant creep {{at temperatures}} above ca. –200°C; however, {{there are three}} main differences between <b>polymeric</b> and metallic creep.|$|E
25|$|Bio{{polymers}} are polymers {{produced by}} living organisms; in other words, they are <b>polymeric</b> biomolecules. Since they are polymers, biopolymers contain monomeric units that are covalently bonded to form larger structures. There are three main classes of biopolymers, classified {{according to the}} monomeric units used {{and the structure of}} the biopolymer formed: polynucleotides (RNA and DNA), which are long polymers composed of 13 or more nucleotide monomers; polypeptides, which are short polymers of amino acids; and polysaccharides, which are often linear bonded <b>polymeric</b> carbohydrate structures.|$|E
25|$|In general, the alkaline-earth metals form {{silicides}} {{with the}} following stoichiometries: MII2Si, MIISi, and MIISi2. In all cases, these substances react with Brønsted–Lowry acids to produce some type of hydride of silicon that {{is dependent on the}} Si anion connectivity in the silicide. The possible products include SiH4 and/or higher molecules in the homologous series SinH2n+2, a <b>polymeric</b> silicon hydride, or a silicic acid. Hence, MIISi with their zigzag chains of Si2 − anions (containing two lone pairs of electrons on each Si anion that can accept protons) yield the <b>polymeric</b> hydride (SiH2)x.|$|E
25|$|Products often {{vary with}} the {{stoichiometry}} of the silicide reactant. For example, Ca2Si is polar and non-conducting and has the anti-PbCl2 structure with single isolated silicon atoms, and reacts with water to produce calcium hydroxide, hydrated silicon dioxide, and hydrogen gas. CaSi with its zigzag chains of silicon atoms instead reacts to give silanes and <b>polymeric</b> SiH2, while CaSi2 with its puckered layers of silicon atoms does not react with water, but will react with dilute hydrochloric acid: the product is a yellow <b>polymeric</b> solid with stoichiometry Si2H2O.|$|E
25|$|While uranium {{trioxide}} is encountered as a <b>polymeric</b> solid under ambient conditions, {{some work}} has been done on the molecular form in the gas phase, in matrix isolations studies, and computationally.|$|E
25|$|The {{compound}} ZnCl2·½HCl·H2O may {{be prepared}} by careful precipitation from {{a solution of}} ZnCl2 acidified with HCl. It contains a <b>polymeric</b> anion (Zn2Cl5 −)n with balancing monohydrated hydronium ions, H5O2+ ions.|$|E
25|$|The ether {{solution}} of alane requires immediate use, because <b>polymeric</b> material rapidly precipitates as a solid. Aluminium hydride solutions {{are known to}} degrade after 3 days. Aluminium hydride is more reactive than LiAlH4.|$|E
25|$|Cellular actin has two forms: monomeric {{globules}} called G-actin and <b>polymeric</b> filaments called F-actin (that is, as filaments {{made up of}} many G-actin monomers). F-actin {{can also}} {{be described as a}} microfilament.|$|E
25|$|Specific {{materials}} and their applications include polymer-protein and polymer-drug conjugates, mediation of enzyme activity, molecular recognition processes and <b>polymeric</b> micelles which can deliver {{a drug to}} a specific site in the body.|$|E
25|$|Natural <b>polymeric</b> {{materials}} such as shellac, amber, wool, silk and natural rubber {{have been used for}} centuries. A variety of other natural polymers exist, such as cellulose, which is the main constituent of wood and paper.|$|E
