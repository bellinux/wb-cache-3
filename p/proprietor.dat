40|$|Roughly 50 {{percent of}} {{self-employed}} <b>proprietors</b> are second-generation <b>proprietors.</b> These individuals acquire informal business experience {{while growing up}} {{in the context of a}} family business. Since some of this informal experience substitutes for more formally acquired schooling, measured rates of return to the latter will not be as high as for wage/salary workers. Early acquisition of managerial human capital that can be acquired only through experience implies differentially greater proprietary success for second-generation <b>proprietors</b> compared with first-generation <b>proprietors.</b> The authors present evidence in favor of both hypotheses. ...|$|R

25|$|In April 1677, South Carolina's Lords <b>Proprietors,</b> {{claiming}} {{a monopoly on}} Indian trade, forbade all trade with the Indians and the Spanish, except by their official agents.

5000|$|The Swedish [...] "Lantmanna" [...] {{party was}} formed in 1867. It {{consisted}} mostly of the larger and smaller peasant <b>proprietors,</b> {{who at the time}} of the old Riksdag of the Estates were always opposed to the nobility and the clergy. The object of the party was to bring about a fusion between the representatives of the large landed <b>proprietors</b> and the regular peasant <b>proprietors,</b> to support the interests of landed <b>proprietors</b> in general against those of the town representatives, and to resist Crown interference in the administration of local affairs.|$|R
500|$|Almost {{immediately}} after {{the establishment of the}} new system, conflict arose. The American Revolutionary War drove potential settlers away from Prince Edward Island. This caused two problems - firstly, it made it difficult for <b>proprietors</b> to fulfill an obligation attached to their grants, to settle one person per [...] within ten years of the system's commencement, and secondly, it meant that the <b>proprietors</b> were not being paid much rent, as there were not many tenants to pay it. This meant that the <b>proprietors</b> were unable, or at least not willing, to pay the required quitrent to the Crown. Conflict also arose between the tenants and the <b>proprietors.</b> As the lottery for Prince Edward Island land was held in London, and most of the <b>proprietors</b> were important figures from the United Kingdom, most of the <b>proprietors</b> did not actually live in British North America. This meant that many neglected their obligations to the settlers.|$|R

50|$|The Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina {{were adopted}} in March 1, 1669 by the eight Lords <b>Proprietors</b> of the Province of Carolina, which {{included}} {{most of the}} land between what is now Virginia and Florida. It replaced the Charter of Carolina and the Concessions and Agreements of the Lords <b>Proprietors</b> of the Province of Carolina (1665). The date March 1, 1669 was the date that <b>proprietors</b> confirmed the Constitutions and sent them to the Colony, but later on two other versions were introduced in 1682 and in 1698. Moreover, the <b>proprietors</b> suspended the Constitutions in 1690. Despite the claims of <b>proprietors</b> on the valid version of the Constitution, the colonists officially recognized the July 21, 1669 version, claiming that six <b>proprietors</b> had sealed the Constitutions as “the unalterable form and rule of Government forever” on that date. The earliest draft of this version in manuscript {{is believed to be the}} one found at Columbia, South Carolina archives.|$|R
50|$|In 1798, the New York Legislature, {{with the}} {{assistance}} of Aaron Burr authorized aliens to hold land directly, and the trustees conveyed the Holland Purchase to the real owners. It was transferred to two sets of <b>proprietors,</b> and one of these sets soon divided into two, making three sets of owners altogether. Each set of <b>proprietors</b> owned their tract as “joint tenants” with right of survivorship, which means as <b>proprietors</b> died off, the surviving <b>proprietors</b> took the deceased's share, and that share did not pass by will or inheritance, except {{in the case of the}} last survivor.|$|R
25|$|Authority was {{delegated}} {{to each of}} the counties under the auspices of local area representatives. Some of the area representatives soon came into conflict with the bowling centre <b>proprietors,</b> for example insisting on costly re-surfacing of lanes, which they argued was unnecessary. The <b>proprietors</b> rebelled and set up their own rival organisation, the Tenpin Bowling <b>Proprietors</b> Association (TBPA), in 1967. An Annual General Meeting of the BTBA saw this conflict rise to a head and most of the governing council resigned, leaving Glazer to regroup and bring back all decisions to the BTBA head office. It took several years to achieve a rapprochement with the <b>proprietors.</b>|$|R
5|$|Louis {{brought his}} wife and queen, Marie Joséphine, from {{mainland}} Europe in 1808. Louis's stay at Gosfield Hall did not last long; he soon moved to Hartwell House in Buckinghamshire, where over one hundred courtiers were housed. The King paid £500 in rent each year to the <b>proprietor,</b> Sir George Lee. The Prince of Wales (the future George IV of Great Britain) was very charitable to the exiled Bourbons.

50|$|The {{division}} between {{the northern and southern}} governments became complete in 1712, but both colonies remained {{in the hands of the}} same group of <b>proprietors.</b> A rebellion against the <b>proprietors</b> broke out in 1719 which led to the appointment of a royal governor for South Carolina in 1720. After nearly a decade in which the British government sought to locate and buy out the <b>proprietors,</b> both North and South Carolina became royal colonies in 1729.|$|R

Miller was thrown in jail for treason, but he escaped and went to England with Eastchurch to tell the <b>Proprietors</b> {{what was happening in}} Albemarle.
