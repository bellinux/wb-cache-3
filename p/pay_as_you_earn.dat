2500|$|Obama and Education Secretary Arne Duncan pursued K-12 {{education}} reform through the Race to the Top grant {{program and the}} use of waivers for the No Child Left Behind Act. Race to the Top gives money to schools that meet certain reform goals, and the program helped encourage the adoption of more rigorous academic standards and new teacher evaluation systems. The program encouraged (but did not require) adoption of the Common Core State Standards Initiative. Obama also advocated for universal pre-kindergarten programs, and two free years of community college for everyone. Through her Let's Move program and advocacy of healthier school lunches, First Lady Michelle Obama focused attention on childhood obesity, which was three times higher in 2008 {{than it had been in}} 1974. In December 2015, Obama signed the Every Student Succeeds Act, a bipartisan bill that reauthorized federally-mandated testing but shrank the federal government's role in education, especially with regard to troubled schools. The law also ended the use of waivers by the Education Secretary. In post-secondary education, Obama signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which ended the role of private banks in lending out federally insured student loans, created a new income-based loan repayment plan known as <b>Pay</b> <b>as</b> <b>You</b> <b>Earn,</b> and increased the amount of Pell Grant awards given each year. He also instituted new regulations on for-profit colleges, including a [...] "gainful employment" [...] rule that restricted federal funding from colleges that failed to adequately prepare graduates for careers.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pay</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> throw is a {{model for}} pricing the {{disposal}} of municipal solid waste by unit of waste rather than by charging a uniform price for pickup and disposal. This acts as a tax on waste - the more waste a household produces, the more it will be charged for its disposal. <b>Pay</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> throw is administered on the municipal level. The purpose behind this system is to discourage waste generation and to encourage recycling. By charging citizens per unit of waste, municipalities hope to discourage waste generation by causing households to consider the quantity of waste they are producing by making them pay for it. It is estimated that <b>pay</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> throw programs have decreased municipal solid waste by about 17% in weight, with a 6% decrease attributed to source reduction efforts and an 8-11% due to waste diversion to recycling and yard programs. In 2006, <b>pay</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> throw had been instituted in over 7,000 United States communities.|$|R
