5|$|When Nintendo {{published}} {{the game in}} North America, the <b>packaging</b> <b>design</b> featured {{a small portion of}} the box cut away to reveal the unique gold-colored cartridge. In 1988, The Legend of Zelda sold two million copies. Nintendo of America sought to keep its strong base of fans; anyone who purchased a game and sent in a warranty card became a member of the Fun Club, whose members got a four-, eight- and eventually 32-page newsletter. Seven hundred copies of the first issue were sent out free of charge, but the number grew as the data bank of names got larger.|$|E

40|$|This article {{develops}} empirically based {{guidelines to}} assist managers in selecting or modifying <b>package</b> <b>designs</b> for achieving desired consumer responses. Seven studies identify the key types of <b>package</b> <b>designs,</b> including {{the factors that}} differentiate those <b>package</b> <b>designs,</b> and determine how these holistic designs are related to consumer brand impressions. The selection of <b>package</b> <b>designs</b> can be simplified {{with the use of}} five holistic types: massive, contrasting, natural, delicate, and nondescript designs. Sincere brands should have natural <b>package</b> <b>designs,</b> exciting brands should have contrasting designs, competent brands should have delicate designs, sophisticated brands should have natural or delicate designs, and rugged brands should have contrasting or massive designs. The authors discuss the potential trade-offs among the impressions created by holistic design types and illustrate their findings with numerous real packages. Ulrich R. Orth, Keven Malkewit...|$|R

5|$|Unlike unique {{sciences}} such as mathematics, the perspective, activity, or {{discipline of}} design is not {{brought to a}} generally accepted common denominator. The historical beginnings of design are complex {{and the nature of}} design is still the subject of ongoing discussion. In design, there are strong differentiations between theory and practice. The fluid nature of the theory allows the designer to operate without being constrained by a rigid structure. In practice, decisions are often referred to as intuition. In his Classification of Design (1976), Gorb divided design into three different classes. Design management operates in and across all three classes: product (e.g. industrial design, <b>packaging</b> <b>design,</b> service design), information (e.g. graphic design, branding, media design, web design), and environment (e.g. retail design, exhibition design, interior design).|$|E
5|$|BK Chicken Fries are a {{fried chicken}} product {{sold by the}} {{international}} fast-food restaurant chain Burger King. At {{the time of their}} introduction in 2005, the company had intended Chicken Fries to be one of their larger, adult oriented products made with higher quality ingredients than their standard menu items. Additionally, the product further targeted the snacking and convenience food markets with a specific <b>packaging</b> <b>design</b> that was intended to be easier to handle and fit into automotive cup holders. The product was part of a series of product introductions designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24- to 36-year-old adult males. Along with this series of larger, more complex group of menu products, the company intended to attract a larger, more affluent adult audience who would be willing to spend more on the better quality products. They were discontinued in the United States in 2012, but continued to be sold in some markets, such as Italy. In August 2014, they were reintroduced for a limited time offering (LTO) in North America, leading to their permanent re-addition to the menu in March 2015 in over 30 countries globally.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} {{indicates that}} children are highly influenced by product packaging {{and that it is}} the packaging that will make the product stand out from the crowd and hopefully making a sale. There {{have been a number of}} valuable studies offering practitioners principles and guidelines on how to enhance <b>package</b> <b>design</b> for products that target children; however the extent to which practitioners adhere to the principles proposed by academics has had limited attention. This study is therefore aimed at examining the degree to which practitioners implement current knowledge relating to the principles of <b>package</b> <b>design</b> in the context of <b>packages</b> <b>designed</b> to attract children, while simultaneously assessing the relationship between <b>package</b> <b>design</b> and brand performance. An extensive secondary research of the literature has been made to establish a list of criterion for <b>package</b> <b>design</b> for children elements assessment. At the same time, attempts have been made to gather brand performance data. Product samples have been collected from major supermarkets in New Zealand and then analysed against the criterion using the principle of content analysis. The result generated by this study shows that practitioners are mostly adhering to the principles of childrenâ€™s <b>package</b> <b>design</b> established by academic research. However, the relationship between brand performance and <b>package</b> <b>design</b> was not established in this study...|$|R
