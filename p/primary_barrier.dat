25|$|In {{terms of}} social barriers, there is a {{significant}} gap between formal legal reforms in theory and their practice in reality. In Morocco's rural and underdeveloped areas, legal equality is perceived as less of an immediate priority than basic, everyday needs. High levels of female illiteracy and a strong sense of traditionalism in many rural areas further compound these challenges. Despite educational campaigns undertaken by various governmental and non-governmental actors (often supported by donor nations such as EU member states), levels of awareness about the reforms remain low, especially in many rural areas, where misinformation about the details of the changes has often filled the knowledge gap. Many supporters of the reforms believe that lack of awareness of the law is the <b>primary</b> <b>barrier</b> to its implementation, with a lack of legal literacy {{compounded by the fact that}} many Moroccans speak a Berber dialect rather than the formal Arabic in which the law is actually written.|$|E

30|$|One of the <b>primary</b> <b>barriers</b> to the uptake of the {{seasonal}} fire {{early warning system}} in Central Kalimantan is that this EWS has historically been used reactively.

Complementing the use of short-range weather information with forecast information with a longer time horizon with greater uncertainty proved challenging.|$|R

The historical northern European view of fire as a destructive agent at odds with agronomic models of forest and rangeland management transcends geographic boundaries. Conifer woodlands of western North America, eucalypt forests of southwest Australia, and the hyperdiverse fynbos of South Africa all share a common history of fire suppression. Another emergent theme is that cultural, social, and political factors form the <b>primary</b> <b>barriers</b> to increased use of prescribed burning. Scientific knowledge and operational capacity are generally not limiting to prescribed burning in most regions reviewed (with {{the possible exception of}} southern Europe).|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to {{barriers to entry}} and competition, barriers to exit may {{be a source of}} market power. Barriers to exit are market conditions that make it difficult or expensive for a company to end its involvement with a market. High liquidation costs are a <b>primary</b> <b>barrier</b> to exiting. Market exit and shutdown are sometimes separate events. The decision whether to shut down or operate is not affected by exit barriers. A company will shut down if price falls below minimum average variable costs.|$|E

50|$|Behavior {{on social}} MOOs and {{role-playing}} MOOs {{has been shown}} to differ. For example, an early study looked at whether users engaged in gender-switching (that is, adopting a different gender online). The majority of participants (60 percent) in social MOOs had never engaged in gender-switching, while the majority (56.7 percent) in role-playing MOOs had done so. However, most of those engaged in gender-switching did so on average only 10 percent of the time. The study also found that the <b>primary</b> <b>barrier</b> to gender-switching was the belief that it is dishonest and manipulative.|$|E

The discrete Fourier transform is used to compute samples [...] of the Fourier transform from samples [...] of a time domain signal. The reassignment operations proposed by Kodera et al. cannot be applied directly to the discrete short-time Fourier transform data, because partial derivatives cannot be computed directly on data that is discrete in time and frequency, {{and it has been}} suggested that this difficulty has been the <b>primary</b> <b>barrier</b> to wider use of the method of reassignment.|$|E
50|$|From a {{manufacturing}} perspective, SOI substrates {{are compatible with}} most conventional fabrication processes. In general, an SOI-based process may be implemented without special equipment or significant retooling of an existing factory. Among challenges unique to SOI are novel metrology requirements {{to account for the}} buried oxide layer and concerns about differential stress in the topmost silicon layer. The threshold voltage of the transistor depends on the history of operation and applied voltage to it, thus making modeling harder.The <b>primary</b> <b>barrier</b> to SOI implementation is the drastic increase in substrate cost, which contributes an estimated 10 - 15% increase to total manufacturing costs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Primary {{barrier of}} {{membrane}} type LNG containment system consist of corrugated 304 L stainless steel. This 304 L stainless steel is {{austenitic stainless steel}} which shows different material behaviors owing to phase transformation during the plastic work.
