5|$|Father Sébastien Rale {{was widely}} {{suspected}} of inciting the Norridgewock tribe against the New Englanders, and Massachusetts Governor Joseph Dudley {{put a price}} on his head. In the winter of 1705, 275 British soldiers under the command of Colonel Winthrop Hilton were dispatched to seize Rale and sack the village. The <b>priest</b> <b>was</b> warned in time, however, and escaped into the woods with his papers, but the militia burned the village and church.|$|E
5|$|The name also {{occurs in}} the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, s.a. 501, as Bieda, one of {{the sons of the}} Saxon founder of Portsmouth. The Liber Vitae of Durham Cathedral names two priests with this name, one of whom is presumably Bede himself. Some manuscripts of the Life of Cuthbert, one of Bede's works, mention that Cuthbert's own <b>priest</b> <b>was</b> named Bede; it is {{possible}} that this priest is the other name listed in the Liber Vitae.|$|E

50|$|The war had a {{profound}} effect on the Church. Between 1926 and 1934 at least 40 <b>priests</b> <b>were</b> killed. Between 1926 and 1934, over 3,000 <b>priests</b> <b>were</b> exiled or assassinated.|$|R

Hindu priests through their extended knowledge of the literature, the Bhagavad Gita and the Ramayana were able to encourage the Hindu community's devotion to Hindu deities.|$|R
5|$|During {{the middle}} of the run-chase, <b>Priest</b> <b>was</b> {{incorrectly}} given out stumped by Healy after the television umpire Asad Rauf had pressed the wrong button, and he had to retract his decision. Soon after New Zealand were at 5/36 after 11 overs, leaving them with 71 runs to score from the last 54 balls, and Australia were in the ascendancy. However, New Zealand's chances were revived by Nicola Browne and Sophie Devine, who put on 41 from as many balls. In the 18th over, Healy caught Browne from Perry's bowling, and Australia went on to win by three runs after New Zealand ended on 6/103.|$|E
5|$|Hebel was {{interested}} in botany, natural history and other subjects. His literary work began with Allemannische Gedichte, which {{is perhaps the most}} popular work written in Alemannic. He had success with his calendar stories in the Badischer Landkalender, and later with Rheinländischer Hausfreund (Rhenish family friend), but a dispute between Catholics forced him to resign as editor of the calendar. In his last years he devoted himself increasingly to religion, becoming a prelate in 1819, but his wish to become a parish <b>priest</b> <b>was</b> never fulfilled. His last works were biblical stories for young readers, which served as textbooks until 1855. Hebel died 1826 in Schwetzingen. Goethe, Tolstoy, Gottfried Keller, Hermann Hesse and other writers have praised his works.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{principal}} {{source of}} information about the Andes was Charles Wiener's 1880 book Pérou et Bolivie ("Peru and Bolivia"), which contained 1,100 engravings from which Hergé could base his own illustrations. In this way, small details about Andean costume and material culture were accurately copied. Part of the ceremonial costume worn by the Incan <b>priest</b> <b>was</b> based upon a colour painting of Mexican Aztecs produced by Else Bostelmann for the National Geographic Society which Hergé had a copy of in his files. He ensured that his depiction of the Peruvian trains was accurate by basing them upon examples found in a two-volume picture encyclopedia of railways published by Librarie Hachette in 1927.|$|E

Other titles used by Heironian <b>priests</b> <b>are</b> Hero of the Third Rank, Hero of the Second Rank, Hero of the First Rank, Champion of Glory, Knight Gallant, Knight Courageous, Knight Valiant, and Knight Champion. Senior <b>priests</b> <b>are</b> called Paragons, while those who command armies {{are known as}} Paragon-Generals. These titles are {{separate}} from duty-titles such as postulant, novitiate, professed priest, cloistered cleric, affirmed priest, and templar. They are also separate from ranks within the temple hierarchy such as hierodeacon and abbot. In everyday use, senior <b>priests</b> <b>are</b> called Father or Mother, while lesser <b>priests</b> <b>are</b> known as Brother or Sister. There is also an elite order of priests known as the gloryaxes.|$|R

5|$|In 1686, Seringapatam, {{the capital}} of the Kingdom of Mysore, had a {{community}} of more than 400 Catholics. The community was severely harassed in the following two decades, with the churches destroyed and the priest's house confiscated. The destruction was undertaken under the name of the Wodeyar king, Kanthirava Narasaraja I, by his finance minister. The priest's house was returned to the church in 1709. Relations between the Wodeyars and the Mangalorean Catholics improved until 1717, when there was an anti-Christian outburst. The resident <b>priest</b> <b>was</b> expelled and forbidden to preach. Several more anti-Christian outbursts followed. By 1736, there were better relations between the two groups.|$|E
5|$|It is {{recorded}} in Domesday that a <b>priest</b> <b>was</b> resident in Ashby, {{and that the}} church dedicated to St Helen consisted only of a nave. In about 1144, Philip Beaumais, lord of the Manor of Ashby, granted the church, its lands and revenues to the Augustinian community of Lilleshall Abbey, which retained possession until 1538. A 2013 excavation found evidence of a two-storey vicarage dating from this period, but the building fell into disrepair following the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the site was cleared in the English Civil War of 1642–49.|$|E
5|$|Symeon {{taught that}} putting oneself under the {{guidance}} of a spiritual father was essential for those who were serious about living the spiritual life. That relationship was a historical tradition especially prominent among the Desert Fathers, who defined the qualifications for acting in the role of a spiritual father: personal experience; an interior life; purity of heart; the vision of God; insight; inspiration; discernment. Official ordination as a <b>priest</b> <b>was</b> not a requirement—Symeon's own spiritual father was a simple unordained monk who had many spiritual children. Symeon also taught that such teachers were empowered by their holiness to preach and to absolve others of their sins, a view that brought him into disagreement with church leaders of his time.|$|E
50|$|Eleven <b>priests,</b> who <b>are</b> called Renhyoshu, are {{appointed}} in December {{of the previous}} year to participate in the Omizutori festivals. Much preparation goes into this yearly festival, and the <b>priests</b> <b>are</b> tasked with cleaning the sites for the rituals, making circuit pilgrimages to surrounding shrines and temples, and preparing various goods that are used in the rituals. During the time leading up to Omizutori, the <b>priests</b> <b>are</b> forbidden to speak at all or leave their lodgings. Each <b>priest</b> <b>is</b> very firm in the practice of his duty in specific, strict orders, and preparing himself for the ceremonies to come.|$|R
50|$|Of the <b>priests</b> who <b>were</b> {{accused of}} sexual abuse, 59% {{were accused of}} a single allegation. 41% of the <b>priests</b> <b>were</b> the subject {{of more than one}} allegation.

5|$|The Waverly {{landed at}} a vacant area near San Pedro, Los Angeles, in January1832. Bachelot and Short {{traveled}} to the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, where they were welcomed by the Franciscans who staffed the mission. Bachelot later became the pastor of a church in Los Angeles, served as an assistant minister for the mission, and led the mission on an interim basis after its <b>priest</b> <b>was</b> reassigned in 1834. He also taught in Los Angeles schools during a teacher shortage. He ministered in California until 1837 and became popular with Angelenos.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the Protestant German Basel Mission of 1834 in Mangalore brought many {{handicraft}} industries, such as cotton weaving and tile-manufacturing, to the region {{and led to a}} large-scale rise in employment. In 1836–37, the political situation in Portugal was in turmoil. Antonio Feliciano de Santa Rita Carvalho, a Portuguese <b>priest,</b> <b>was</b> appointed Archbishop-elect of Goa in September 1836 without authorisation from the then Pope, Gregory XVI. Many Mangalorean Catholics did not accept the leadership of Carvalho but instead submitted to the Vicar Apostolic of Verapoly in Travancore, while some of them continued to be {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Goa and Daman. The parishes in South Canara were divided into two groups—one under Goa and the other under Verapoly.|$|E
5|$|To the consternation of Hamond {{and some}} other parishioners, the bishop delayed issuing an {{instruction}} forbidding Davidson to preach. When Hamond locked the Morston church against him, the rector preached to a large congregation on the grass outside the church. In August, Davidson's licence to minister as a <b>priest</b> <b>was</b> revoked; his last service was morning worship at Stiffkey on 21 August 1932, when around 1,000 people congregated outside the church. That afternoon he demanded the Morston church keys from Hamond, who sent him away by turning him round and administering a substantial kick. Hamond was later fined for this assault.|$|E

5|$|Written by Christopher Priest, the {{opportunity}} to write this four-part story was offered to Priest after his previous script, Sealed Orders, had been cancelled. The scene breakdown was commissioned on 5 December 1980 and the scripts on 6 February 1981. Priest's story idea dealt with the 'secret' of what actually powered the TARDIS, in this case fear. Somewhere hidden inside the TARDIS was the one being the Doctor feared above all others, and the psychic {{tension between the two}} of them produced the energy to move through space and time. The story involved the Doctor having to confront and ultimately defeat this fear, and was designed to write out the character of Adric. After hearing nothing from the production office with regard to his completed scripts or his payment for them, Priest made contact with John Nathan-Turner. He was told that the scripts were unusable and that he would not be paid. After a bitter dispute <b>Priest</b> <b>was</b> paid and both Nathan-Turner and Eric Saward forced to pen a letter of apology over their treatment of the writer. The script was replaced by Saward's script Earthshock.|$|E
5|$|On October 12, 1957, {{during the}} peak of the Cold War, a number of parishes of the Armenian Apostolic Church in America, which were unaffiliated since 1933, came {{together}} under the Holy See of Cilicia with the headquarters in Lebanon, close to the Armenian Revolutionary Federation. After the World War II, Archbishop Tiran Nersoyan led the church through a second founding, which saw the framing of by-laws to govern the diocese, the creation of a nationwide youth organization. the initiation of a project to build an Armenian cathedral in Manhattan and the entry of the Armenian Church into the ecumenical movement. The middle 1950s saw an uptick in immigration and a building boom of Armenian churches, with new communities proliferating across the US. A generation of leaders born in America also began to exert itself. The first American-born Armenian <b>priest</b> <b>was</b> ordained in 1956. In 1961, St. Nersess Armenian Seminary was established in Illinois (later, it would move to New York). A spirit of renewed vigor was embodied by Archbishop Torkom Manoogian, who governed the diocese as primate from 1966 to 1990. The period saw a large influx of Armenian immigrants. These developments refocused the priorities of the Armenian Church in America. The need for humanitarian relief to the Armenian homeland, as well as outreach to refugees settling throughout the US (concentrated in New York and Los Angeles), {{led to the creation of}} the Fund for Armenian Relief—through which the church delivers material and medical aid to Armenia.|$|E
