50|$|Sensory {{deprivation}} (Sendep) or <b>perceptual</b> <b>isolation</b> is {{the deliberate}} reduction or removal of stimuli {{from one or}} more of the senses. Simple devices such as blindfolds or hoods and earmuffs can cut off sight and hearing, while more complex devices can also cut off the sense of smell, touch, taste, thermoception (heat-sense), and 'gravity'. Sensory deprivation has been used in various alternative medicines and in psychological experiments (e.g. with an isolation tank).|$|E

At the N.I.M.H. in 1954, {{with the desire}} of isolating a brain from external stimulation, he devised the first isolation tank, a dark soundproof tank of warm salt water in which subjects could float for long periods in sensory isolation. Lilly and a research colleague {{were the first to}} act as subjects of this research. What had been known as <b>perceptual</b> <b>isolation</b> or sensory deprivation was reconceptualized as Restricted Environmental Stimulation Technique (R.E.S.T.).|$|E

The chief impetus, of course, was the dismay at the kind of [...] "confessions" [...] being produced at the Russian Communist trials. [...] "Brainwashing" [...] was a term that came a little later, applied to Chinese procedures. We did not know what the Russian procedures were, but it seemed that they were producing some peculiar changes of attitude.

40|$|Perceptual and {{preferential}} {{decision making}} {{have been studied}} largely in <b>isolation.</b> <b>Perceptual</b> decisions {{are considered to be}} at a non-deliberative cognitive level and have an outside criterion that defines the quality of decisions. Preferential decisions are considered to be at a higher cognitive level and the quality of decisions depend on the decision maker's subjective goals. Besides these crucial differences, both types of decisions also have in common that uncertain information about the choice situation has to be processed before a decision can be made. The present work aims to acknowledge the commonalities of both types of decision making to lay bare the crucial differences. For this aim we examine perceptual and preferential decisions with a novel choice paradigm that uses the identical stimulus material for both types of decisions. This paradigm allows us to model the decisions and response times of both types of decisions with the same sequential sampling model, the drift diffusion model. The results illustrate that the different incentive structure in both types of tasks changes people's behavior so that they process information more efficiently and respond more cautiously in the perceptual as compared to the preferential task. These findings set out a perspective for further integration of perceptual and preferential decision making in a single ramework...|$|R
40|$|The current {{dissertation}} proposes three manners {{in which}} findings about the neuroscience of decision-making can inform traditional questions in economics that historically {{has been investigated}} using choice data alone, and without delineating the mechanism of choice. The first chapter investigates the origins of {{a critical component of}} both economic and perceptual decision-making under uncertainty: the belief formation process. Most research has studied belief formation in economic and <b>perceptual</b> decision-making in <b>isolation.</b> One reason for this separate treatment may be the assumption that there are distinct psychological mechanisms that underlie belief formation in economic and perceptual decisions. An alternative theory is that there exists a common mechanism that governs belief formation in both domains. Here,we test this alternative theory by combining a novel computational modeling technique with two well-known experimental paradigms. I estimate a drift-diffusion model (DDM) and provide an analytical method to decode prior beliefs from DDM parameters. Subjects in our experiment exhibit strong extrapolative beliefs in both paradigms. In line with the common mechanism hypothesis, we find that a single computational model explains belief formation in both tasks, and that individual differences in belief formation are correlated across tasks. These results suggest that extrapolative beliefs in economic decision-making may stem from low-level automatic processes that also play a role in perceptual decision-making, and therefore might be difficult to suppress. The second chapter investigates the role of the sex steroid hormone testosterone as a biological mediator that translates environmental changes into shifts in cognition, that influence decision-making. Correlational studies have linked testosterone with aggression and disorders associated with poor impulse control, but corresponding mechanisms are poorly understood and {{there is no evidence of}} causality. Building on a dual-process framework, I identify a mechanism for testosterone’s behavioral effects in humans: reducing cognitive reflection. In the largest testosterone administration study to date, 243 men received either testosterone or placebo and took the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) that estimated their capacity to override incorrect intuitive judgments with deliberate correct responses. Testosterone administration reduced CRT scores. The effect was robust to controlling for age, mood, math skills, treatment expectancy, and 14 other hormones. The effects were enhanced in subjects with high cortisol and estradiol levels. These findings suggest a unified mechanism underlying testosterone’s varied behavioral effects in humans and provide novel, clear, and testable predictions. In the third chapter, I study dynamic unstructured bargaining with deadlines and one-sided private information about the amount available to share (the “pie size"). Using mechanism design theory, I show that given the players’ incentives, the equilibrium incidence of bargaining failures (“strikes”) should increase with the pie size, and I derive a condition under which strikes are efficient. In our setting, no equilibrium satisfies both equality and efficiency in all pie sizes. I derive two equilibria that resolve the trade-off between equality and efficiency by either favoring equality or favoring efficiency. Using a novel experimental paradigm, I confirm that strike incidence is decreasing in the pie size. Subjects reach equal splits in small pie games (in which strikes are efficient), while most payoffs are close to either the efficient or the equal equilibrium prediction when the pie is large. I employ a machine learning approach to show that bargaining process features recorded early in the game improve out of sample prediction of disagreements at the deadline. The process feature predictions are as accurate as predictions from pie sizes only, and adding process and pie data together improve predictions even more. As process data can be much richer than the series of cursor locations that we have used (for example, by including skin conductance, pupil dilation or facial expressions), better inference of outcome variables is likely feasible. Thus, if a policy maker or a mediator can access an independent measure of private information, an arbitration mechanism may allow boosting efficiency by taking this measurement into account. </p...|$|R
40|$|The review {{analyzes}} the experiments on <b>perceptual</b> <b>isolation</b> with special {{reference to the}} phenomena of reported visual and auditory sensations. Variables analyzed include: methods of confinement and restriction, conditions of illumination, duration of isolation, set, instructions and suggestions, reporting or verbalization instructions, sleep, subject populations, prior knowledge and expectations, intelligence and personality characteristics of Ss, stress response, and methods of obtaining reported visual and auditory sensations. The relevance {{of some of the}} findings to physiological, psychoanalytic, cognitive, and social psychological theories of <b>perceptual</b> <b>isolation</b> are discussed. Variables which seem important in the phenomena discussed are set, verbalization instructions, S's alertness, and E's methods of obtaining responses. The unexpected reports of hallucinations in the first perceptual-isolation report (Heron, Bexton, & Hebb, 19 S 3) fascinated clinicians, theoreticians, and experimentalists, and stimulated widespread interest in other responses to isolation.

40|$|Ss who {{successfully}} completed 1 wk. of immobilization {{showed no significant}} changes in subjective stress and mood or in the urinary excretion of adrenaline and noradrenaline (catecholamines) relative to recumbent controls. On the other hand, the catecholamine excretion of the immobilization quitters was related to their endurance. The early quitters showed no significant changes, whereas the late quitters showed an increase, particularly in adrenaline excretion. Another characteristic of the quitters was {{the presence of a}} lower base-line level of adrenaline, relative to successful Ss and recumbent controls, not only prior to immobilization but also 2 mo. after its termination. Unfortunately, the results only bordered on statistical significance. A striking similarity was noted between these results and those obtained in an earlier study involving 1 wk. of <b>perceptual</b> <b>isolation.</b> Zubek and Schutte (1966) recently reported that Ss {{who successfully}} endured a week of <b>perceptual</b> <b>isolation</b> showed no significan...|$|E
40|$|Ss who {{successfully}} completed {{a week of}} <b>perceptual</b> <b>isolation</b> showed no significant changes in urinary excretion of adrenaline and noradrenaline relative {{to a group of}} control Ss. They also showed no changes on a behavioral measure of subjective stress and mood. Isolation "quitters, " i. e., those who failed to complete the prescribed period, also showed no change in noradrenaline. Their urinary excretion of adrenaline, however, increased, but only in Ss who terminated isolation late in the 1 -wk period. Perhaps the most important characteristic of the isolation quitters was the presence of a significantly lower baseline level of adrenaline, relative to that of the successful experimental Ss, not only prior to isolation but also many months after its termination. No such difference was found for noradrenaline. These results seem to suggest that isolation quitters may be biochemically or "constitutionally" different from volunteers who can successfully complete a prolonged period of <b>perceptual</b> <b>isolation.</b> Various investigators have reported that prolonged exposure of human subjects (Ss) to either sensory or perceptual deprivation is a stressful experience (Bexton, Heron, &...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} made of {{physiological}} (GSR) and verbal stress responses to total per-ceptual isolation (darkness and silence) and partial isolation (darkness with sound or silence with light). The results on the GSR indices indicate that, after IS hr., total isolation is more stressful than partial isolation. Verbal indices indicate that all types of isolation are equally stressful.

40|$|The {{responses}} of 36 males and 36 females to 3 hr. of total sensory deprivation (SD) or partial SD (light or sound deprivation) were compared. Females {{scored significantly higher}} on a measure of verbalized stress derived from ratings of the post-SD interview. Males showed a near-significant (p<. 06) tendency for a greater increase in GSR conductance from the baseline {{to the end of the}} experi-ment. Both males and females had more spontaneous fluctuations of GSR in the total SD than in the partial SD conditions. None of the verbal stress measures yielded differences between SD conditions. Personality measures of passive-feminine traits and values and field-dependency in the males did not correlate with either verbal or physiological indices of stress response to SD. The results give limited support to the theory combining set and enforced passivity as ex-planations of sex differences in response to SD.

40|$|The {{scientific}} study of Buddhist meditation has proceeded without much attention to Buddhist literature that details the range of psychological and physiological changes thought to occur during meditation. This paper presents reports of various meditation-induced light experiences derived from American Buddhist practitioners. The reports of light experiences are classified into two main types: discrete lightforms and patterned or diffuse lights. Similar phenomena are well documented in traditional Buddhist texts but are virtually undocumented in scientific literature on meditation. Within Buddhist traditions, these phenomena are attributed a range of interpretations. However, because it is insufficient and problematic to rely solely upon the textual sources {{as a means of}} investigating the cause or significance of these phenomena, these qualitative reports are also considered in relation to scientific research on light-related experiences in the context of sensory deprivation, <b>perceptual</b> <b>isolation,</b> and clinical disorders of the visual system. The typologies derived from these studies also rely upon reports of experiences and closely match typologies derived from the qualitative study of contemporary practitioners and typologies found in Buddhist literary traditions. Taken together, these studies also provide evidence in support of the hypothesis that certain meditative practices—especially those that deliberately decrease social, kinesthetic, and sensory stimulation and emphasize focused attention—have perceptual and cognitive outcomes similar to sensory deprivation. Given that sensory deprivation increases neuroplasticity, meditation may also have an enhanced neuroplastic potential beyond ordinary experience-dependent changes. By providing and contextualizing these reports of meditation-induced light experiences, scientists, clinicians, and meditators gain a more informed view of the range of experiences that can be elicited by contemplative practices...|$|E
40|$|Three {{experimentally}} sophisticated chimpanzees (Pan), Akira, Chloe, and Ai, {{were trained}} on visual search performance using a modified multiple-alternative matching-to-sample task {{in which a}} sample stimulus {{was followed by the}} search display containing one target identical to the sample and several uniform distractors (i. e., negative comparison stimuli were identical to each other). After they acquired this task, they were tested for transfer of visual search performance to trials in which the sample was not followed by the uniform search display (odd-item search). Akira showed positive transfer of visual search performance to odd-item search even when the display size (the number of stimulus items in the search display) was small, whereas Chloe and Ai showed a transfer only when the display size was large. Chloe and Ai used some nonrelational cues such as <b>perceptual</b> <b>isolation</b> of the target among uniform distractors (so-called pop-out). In addition to the odd-item search test, various types of probe trials were presented to clarify the controlling relations in multiple-alternative matching to sample. Akira showed a decrement of accuracy {{as a function of the}} display size when the search display was nonuniform (i. e., each "distractor" stimulus was not the same), whereas Chloe and Ai showed perfect performance. Furthermore, when the sample was identical to the uniform distractors in the search display, Chloe and Ai never selected an odd-item target, but Akira selected it when the display size was large. These results indicated that Akira's behavior was controlled mainly by relational cues of target-distractor oddity, whereas an identity relation between the sample and the target strongly controlled the performance of Chloe and Ai...|$|E
40|$|Mental imagery {{has been}} linked to {{creativity}} through the reports of many historically creative individuals. Following a review and evaluation of the theoretical, anecdotal and empirical literature, the material presented in the thesis investigates the role of individual differences in mental imagery in performance on psychometric creativity tasks. A meta-analytic review of previous research showed a small marginally acceptable criterion association between self-reported mental imagery vividness and control and divergent thinking performance. However, additional non-statistical examination showed that further investigation was required. This led to five studies of the variables under consideration and a revised meta-analytic review {{in the light of the}} findings. The main conclusion was that self-report measures of mental imagery have a statistically significant but inconsequential association with divergent thinking performance. Consequently a new series of studies was undertaken in which the creative visualization task (CVT) was employed using an individual differences approach. Having established the parametric properties of a test-format version of the CVT two behavioural measures of mental imagery were used to predict performance. As neither measure predicted CVT performance high and low vividness and Symbolic Equivalence Test groups were used to assess a dissociative model of CVT performance. A significant interaction effect showed that vividness plays a mediating role in predicting CVT performance. In two final studies the individual differences approach was employed in the context of a hypothesised perceptual mediation. The results showed firstly that High Imagers performed significantly better than Low Imagers in creativity tasks following <b>perceptual</b> <b>isolation</b> and secondly that Low Imagers performed significantly better on perceptually sourced creativity tasks than on verbally sourced creativity tasks. The combined findings suggest that, while established protocols do not support a strong imagery-creativity association, new methods of investigation may reveal the predicted differences in creativity between high and low imagery participants...|$|E
