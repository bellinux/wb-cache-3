40|$|A {{central issue}} {{in the study of}} primate {{communication}} {{is the extent to which}} individuals adjust their behaviour to the attention and signals of others, and manipulate others’ attention to communicate about external events. I investigated whether 13 chimpanzees (<b>Pan</b> troglodytes <b>spp.),</b> 11 bonobos (<b>Pan</b> paniscus), and 7 orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus) followed conspecific attention and led others to distal locations. Individuals were presented with a novel stimulus, to test if they would lead a conspecific to detect it in two experimental conditions. In one the conspecific faced the communicator, while another required the communicator to first attract the attention of a conspecific. All species followed conspecific attention, but only bonobos in conditions that required geometric attention following and that the communicator first attract the conspecific‘s attention. There was a clear trend for the chimpanzees to selectively produce a stimulus directional ‘hunching’ posture when viewing the stimulus in the presence of a conspecific rather than alone (the comparison was statistically non-significant, but very closely approached significance [p = 0. 056]), and the behaviour consistently led conspecifics to look towards the stimulus. An observational study showed that ‘hunching’ only occurred in the context of attention following. Some chimpanzees and bonobos consistently and selectively combined functionally different behaviours (consisting of sequential auditory-stimulus- directional-behaviours), when viewing the stimulus in the presence of a non-attentive conspecific, although at species level this did not yield significant effects. While the design did not eliminate the possibility of a social referencing motive (“look and help me decide how to respond”), the coupling of auditory cues followed by directional cues towards a novel object, is consistent with a declarative and social referential interpretation of non-verbal deixis. An exploratory study, which applied the ‘Social Attention Hypothesis’ (that individuals accord and receive attention as a function of dominance) to attention following, showed that chimpanzees were more likely to follow the attention of the dominant individual. Overall, the results suggest that the paucity of observed referential behaviours in apes may owe to the inconspicuousness and multi-faceted nature of the behaviours...|$|R
50|$|Appendix I, about 1200 species, are {{species that}} are {{threatened}} with extinction and are or may be affected by trade. Commercial trade in wild-caught specimens of these species is illegal (permitted only in exceptional licensed circumstances). Captive-bred animals or cultivated plants of Appendix I species are considered Appendix II specimens, with concomitant requirements (see below and Article VII). The Scientific Authority of the exporting country must make a non-detriment finding, assuring that export of the individuals will not adversely affect the wild population. Any trade in these species requires export and import permits. The Management Authority of the exporting state is expected to check that an import permit has been secured and that the importing state is able {{to care for the}} specimen adequately. Notable animal species listed in Appendix I include the red panda (Ailurus fulgens), western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), the chimpanzee species (<b>Pan</b> <b>spp.),</b> tigers (Panthera tigris subspecies), Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica), leopards (Panthera pardus), jaguar (Panthera onca), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), some populations of African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the dugong and manatees (Sirenia), and all rhinoceros species (except some Southern African subspecies populations).|$|E
40|$|The {{available}} information concerning reproduction, ontogeny, behavioral patterns and social relationships in all species of extant and some extinct were analysed cladistically. The character set was optimized on the phylogeny of the Hominoidea, {{and the particular}} common ancestors were reconstructed. The study reveals that all common ancestors (excluding the common ancestor of <b>Pan</b> <b>spp.)</b> showed more or less gorilla-like patterns of behavior and social system. The major outcome {{of this study is}} the finding that humans, despite universal assumptions, are (in terms of behavior and sociobiology) rather slightly derived gorillas than substantially derived chimpanzees...|$|E
40|$|Chimpanzees (<b>Pan</b> <b>spp.)</b> {{were tested}} on a habituation/dishabituation {{paradigm}} that was originally developed {{to test for}} comprehension of causality in very young human infants. Three versions of the test were used: a food item being moved by a hand, a human pushing another human off a chair to obtain a food item, and a film clip of natural chimpanzee behaviour (capturing and eating a monkey). Chimpanzees exhibited similar results to those obtained with human infants, with significantly elevated levels of looking on the dishabituation trials. Since the level of response was significantly greater on natural/unnatural sequences than on unnatural/natural sequences, we conclude that the chimpanzees were not responding just to novelty but rather to events that infringed their sense of natural causation...|$|E
40|$|Basal {{hominoids}} (i. e. apes, hominids and humans) appeared approximately 24 {{million years}} ago. The genus Homo derive from a hominoid lineage {{that includes the}} extinct australopithecines and the extant chimpanzees and gorillas (see Fig. 1). It is now well established that the closest relatives of modern humans are the chimpanzees (<b>Pan</b> <b>spp.),</b> with the Homo–Pan divergence having occurred 4. 5 – 5. 5 million years ago and the earlier separation of Gorilla 5. 5 – 7 million years ago (Goodman et al., 1994). Phylogenetic reconstruction using parsimony suggests that much of hominoid evolution occurred at mid-montane elevations (Fig. 1). Key features separating humans from their hominoid relatives are an enlarged neocortex, a reduced anterior dentition, bipedalism and sophisticated interindividual (and particularly intersexual) interactions (Lovejoy, 1981). Bipedalism, of course, is the salient locomotor feature of humans, and this trait is evident in fossils of our prehuman australopithecine predecessors as early as 4 million years ago (see White, 1980; White et al., 1994; Leakey et al., 1995) ...|$|E
40|$|Fission-fusion social systems, {{in which}} members of a social {{community}} form frequently changing subgroups, occur {{in a number of}} mammalian taxa. Such systems are assumed to be a response to the costs of grouping, but evidence to support this hypothesis is limited. We use a linear programming approach to build a time budget model that predicts the upper bound on group size in order to test the hypothesis that fission-fusion social systems are the outcome of time constraints. Comparative data from 14 wild chimpanzee (<b>Pan</b> <b>spp.)</b> populations are used to derive a set of equations defining the relationship between climatic variables and time budget components, which are then used to calculate the upper limits on group size that can be maintained in different habitats. We validate the model by showing that it correctly predicts the presence/absence of chimpanzees across sub-Saharan Africa and the group sizes observed in natural populations. The model suggests that the costs of travel are limiting for chimpanzees. Chimpanzees can reduce these costs dramatically by fissioning their bonded communities into small foraging parties. If they did not, they would be unable to live in any habitats where they currently occur. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc...|$|E
