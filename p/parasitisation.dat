In a wind tunnel bioassay, Aphidius eadyi, Aphidius rhopalosiphi, Diaeretiella rapae, Ephedrus plagiator, Praon myzophagum and Praon volucre responded to the aphid sex pheromone components nepetalactone and nepetalactol. P. myzophagum reared on two different host aphid species showed different responses to combinations of nepetalactone and nepetalactol in the wind tunnel, indicating that long term laboratory rearing may influence parasitoid responses to aphid sex pheromones. The ability of two aphid parasitoids to learn aphid sex pheromones through prior exposure {{in the presence of}} host aphids was investigated. The generalist E. plagiator showed evidence of associative learning, whereas the specialist Aphidius ervi did not. When A. ervi was exposed to the pheromone without contact with host aphids, the parasitoid response was reduced by habituation. Exposure to aphid sex pheromone during laboratory host attack trials had no effect on the host attack behaviour of A. ervi. In laboratory cage experiments, aphid sex pheromone lures increased the retention of A. rhopalosiphi, but not by Praon volucre, on aphid-infested plants. In a wind tunnel bioassay, aphid sex pheromone enhanced the attraction of A. ervi to a plant-host complex. In the field, aphid sex pheromone lures increased <b>parasitisation</b> rates by A. rhopalosiphi and P. volucre on aphid-infested potted plants.

This study aims to provide a range of baseline information on the developmental parameters and <b>parasitisation</b> efficacy of three Italian populations of D. suzukii parasitoids at different temperatures. The species tested were a larval parasitoid, Leptopilina heterotoma (Thomson), and two pupal parasitoids, Pachycrepoideus vindemiae (Rondani) and Trichopria drosophilae (Perkins).

Interestingly in plasmatocytes from Nrg mutants the nucleokinesis regulating protein Lissencephaly- 1 (Lis 1) fails to localise properly around the nucleus and is instead found diffuse throughout the cytoplasm and at unidentified perinuclear structures. After attaching to the wasp egg control plasmatocytes extend filopodia laterally from their cell periphery; as well as extending lateral filopodia plasmatocytes from Nrg mutants also extend many filopodia from their apical surface. Conclusion The Drosophila cellular adhesion molecule Neuroglian is expressed in haemocytes and its activity is required for the encapsulation of L. boularli eggs. At the cell periphery of haemocytes Neuroglian may be involved in cell-cell interactions, while at the cell centre Neuroglian regulates the localisation of the nucleokinesis complex protein lissencephaly- 1. </p...|$|E
40|$|Fish {{represent}} {{the most frequently}} used vertebrate class for the investigation of endocrine disruption (ED) in wildlife. However, field studies are complicated by exposure scenarios involving a variety of anthropogenic and natural influences interfering with the endocrine system. One natural aspect rarely considered in ecotoxicological studies is how parasites modulate host physiology. Therefore, investigations were carried out to characterise the impacts of the parasitic tapeworm Ligula intestinalis on plasma sex steroid levels and expression of key genes associated with the reproduction in roach (Rutilus rutilus), a sentinel species for wildlife ED research. <b>Parasitisation</b> by L. intestinalis suppressed gonadal development in both genders of roach and analysis of plasma sex steroids revealed substantially lower levels of 17 beta-oestradiol (E 2) and 11 -ketotestosterone (11 -KT) in infected females as well as E 2, 11 -KT, and testosterone in infected males. Consistently, in both, infected females and males, expression of the oestrogen dependent genes such as vitellogenin and brain-type aromatase in liver and brain was reduced. Furthermore, <b>parasitisation</b> differentially modulated mRNA expression of the oestrogen and androgen receptors in brain and liver. Most prominently, liver expression of oestrogen receptor 1 was reduced in infected females but not in males, whereas expression of oestrogen receptor 2 a was up-regulated in both genders. Further, insulin-like growth factor 1 mRNA in the liver was increased in infected females but not in males. Despite severe impacts on plasma sex steroids and pituitary gonadotropin expression, brain mRNA levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) precursors encoding GnRH 2 and GnRH 3 were not affected by L. intestinalis-infection. In summary, the present results provide basic knowledge of the endocrine system in L. intestinalis-infected roach and clearly demonstrate that parasites can cause ED in fish. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of airborne interaction between different barley cultivars on the behaviour of bird cherry-oat aphid Rhopalosiphum padi, the ladybird Coccinella septempunctata and the parasitoid Aphidius colemani. In certain cultivar combinations, exposure of one cultivar to air passed over a different cultivar caused barley to have reduced aphid acceptance and increased attraction of ladybirds and parasitoids. Parasitoids attacked aphids that had developed on plants under exposure more often than those from unexposed plants, leading to a higher <b>parasitisation</b> rate. Ladybirds, but not parasitoids, were more attracted to combined odours from certain barley cultivars than either cultivar alone. The results show that airborne interactions between undamaged plants can affect higher trophic levels, and that odour differences between different genotypes of the same plant species may be sufficient to affect natural enemy behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The pre-dispersal seed predator, Bruchidius villosus (Coleoptera, Bruchidae) {{destroyed}} ca. 8 % {{of seeds}} of its major host-plant, Laburnum anagyroides (Fabaceae, Genisteae), a tree-like legume, in Hungary. However, almost 40 % of the pods were infested by the beetle. Females {{did not show}} a resource concentration response: with increasing number of seeds per pod, the number of uninfested seeds also increased. A high seed abortion rate of 75 % left {{an average of two}} full-grown seeds per pod. Females laid three-four times more eggs on pods than the number of full-grown seeds present in a pod. Despite this, a high level (ca. 15 %) of egg parasitism and pod abortion that reached levels up to 50 % on pods which already bore bruchid eggs, decreased the infestation level. Larval <b>parasitisation</b> rate of B. villosus by chalcids and braconids exceeded 30 %...|$|E
40|$|Induction {{of plant}} defences, {{specifically}} {{in response to}} herbivore attack, can save costs {{that would otherwise be}} needed to maintain defences {{even in the absence of}} herbivores. However, plants may suffer considerable damage during the time required to mount these defences against an attacker. This could be resolved if plants could respond to early cues, such as egg deposition, that reliably indicate future herbivory. We tested this hypothesis in a field experiment and found that egg deposition by the butterfly Pieris brassicae on black mustard (Brassica nigra) induced a plant response that negatively affected feeding caterpillars. The effect cascaded up to the third and fourth trophic levels (larval parasitoids and hyperparasitoids) by affecting the <b>parasitisation</b> rate and parasitoid performance. Overall, the defences induced by egg deposition had a positive effect on plant seed production and may therefore play an important role in the evolution of plant resistance to herbivores...|$|E
