50|$|The GDPR {{refers to}} <b>pseudonymisation</b> {{as a process}} that {{transforms}} personal data {{in such a way}} that the resulting data cannot be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information. An example of <b>pseudonymisation</b> is encryption, which renders the original data unintelligible and the process cannot be reversed without access to the correct decryption key. The GDPR requires that this additional information (such as the decryption key) be kept separately from the pseudonymised data. <b>Pseudonymisation</b> is recommended to reduce the risks to the concerned data subjects and also help controllers and processors to meet their data-protection obligations (Recital 28).|$|E
5000|$|Although the GDPR {{encourages}} {{the use of}} <b>pseudonymisation</b> to [...] "reduce risks to the data subjects," [...] (Recital 28) pseudonymised data is still considered personal data (Recital 26) and therefore remains covered by the GDPR.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the data}} {{processor}} or controller {{do not have}} to notify the data subjects if anonymized data is breached.

40|$|<b>Pseudonymisation</b> {{is gaining}} {{traction}} among modern electronic identification systems as a privacy enhancing technique that can significantly reduce risks of personal data misuse. The recently agreed General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR) encourages {{the use of}} <b>pseudonymisation</b> to comply with its requirement of privacy-by-design. Art. 5 of the European Regulation on electronic identification and trust services (eIDAS) on data processing and protection simply allows the use of pseudonyms in electronic transactions although the facilitation of {{the implementation of the}} principle of privacy by design is clearly among the aims listed by Art. 12 of eIDAS. This paper examines the concept of <b>pseudonymisation</b> under eIDAS and the GDPR and suggests that the two Regulations employ two very different, if not incompatible, notions of <b>pseudonymisation.</b> It concludes that a common terminology and approach would be preferable in order to ensure consistency and legal certaint...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Pseudonymisation as a {{data privacy}} concept for medical data is not new. The process of <b>pseudonymisation</b> gets {{difficult}} in concrete use-case setups {{and the different}} variations of data flow between those who collect, who store, and who access the data. In all cases, questions have to be answered about, who {{has access to the}} demographics of a person, who has access to the pseudonym, and finally, who creates the pseudonym. Since a fundamental part of the pseudonym creation depends on the identification of a person on base of its demographics, things even get more difficult in case of unclear matching decisions, management of wrong matching or update of demographic information. In this journal article, a unified view on pseudonyms is proposed. Pseudonyms are treated as a local identifier in an identifier domain, but in a domain that has no demographics. Additionally, persistent identifiers are introduced that allow the handling of updates and internal matching reconsiderations. Finally, two concepts for <b>pseudonymisation</b> are shown: First, a National <b>Pseudonymisation</b> Service is sketched with focus on resistance against update problems and wrong matching decisions. It is designed to cover every possible variation of the exchange of local identifiers between a source of personal data and the storage destination. Second, an algorithm for the pseudonym creation from a person identifier is described. This algorithm is needed if the <b>pseudonymisation</b> is not performed by an external service but in-house and in case of limited number space of the pseudonyms. Both solutions are suitable to solve a huge variety of <b>pseudonymisation</b> setups, as it is demanded by researchers of clinical trials and studies.

40|$|Today a {{large number}} of patient records are {{produced}} and these records contain valuable information, often in free text, about the medical treatment of patients. Since these records contain information that can reveal the identity of patients, known as protected health information (PHI), the records cannot easily be made available for the research community. In this research we have used a PHI annotated clinical corpora, written in Swedish, that we have pseudonymised. <b>Pseudonymisation</b> means to replace the sensitive information with fictive information for example real personal names are replaced with fictive personal names based on the gender of the real names and family relations. We have evaluated our results and our five respondents of who three were clinicians found that the clinical text looks real and is readable.

30|$|The key {{question}} {{in the context of}} storage of health data is always with regard to the purpose. The GDPR provides several exemptions and derogations for the use of health data, e.g. in the context of research or public health purposes under certain conditions. Typical procedures in this context include the application of ethical standards for scientific research as mentioned in Recital 33 and the implementation of organisational and technical safeguards as mentioned in Article 89 including anonymisation, <b>pseudonymisation</b> and encryption [2]. <b>Pseudonymisation</b> is generally recommended as long as the research purposes can be fulfilled in this manner. With the condition of such safeguards, the GDPR creates exemptions for researchers to process sensitive health data even beyond the purposes for which they were collected. In addition, the GDPR provides some room for manoeuvre for national regulations (derogations defined by a law) in this context. It is clearly emphasised, however, that exemptions and derogations for research purposes should not result in personal data being processed for other purposes by third parties such as employers, insurance or banking companies (Recital 54, [1].|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} the use of data {{in the context of}} research projects, public health or biobanks as well as ‘big data’ analytics, while protecting personal data, the new GDPR proposes technical and organisational measures such as anonymisation, <b>pseudonymisation</b> and encryption. The term anonymisation refers to removing personally identifiable information where it is not needed (e.g. the name of the patient and institution, the date and other text data on images, and perhaps even DICOM metadata from the PACS file which would allow re-identification). <b>Pseudonymisation</b> refers to the users replacing personally identifiable material with artificial identifiers. It means the processing of personal data {{in such a way that}} the data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, as long as such additional information is kept separately and subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure non-attribution to an identified or identifiable natural person. Recital 26 (an explanatory text which is part of the legislation that sets out reasons for the provisions of Article 4) explains the following: data which have undergone <b>pseudonymisation,</b> which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information, should be considered as information on an identifiable natural person. To determine whether a person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by any other person, to identify the individual directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether means likely to be used to identify the individual are reasonable, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking into consideration both available technology at the time of the processing and technological development [2].|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Our {{aim was to}} {{estimate}} the rate of data linkage error in Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) by testing the HESID pseudoanonymisation algorithm against a reference standard, in a national registry of paediatric intensive care records. Setting: The Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network (PICANet) database, covering 33 paediatric intensive care units in England, Scotland and Wales. Participants: Data from infants and young people aged 0 – 19 years admitted between 1 January 2004 and 21 February 2014. Primary and secondary outcome measures: PICANet admission records were classified as matches (records belonging to the same patient who had been readmitted) or non-matches (records belonging to different patients) after applying the HESID algorithm to PICANet records. False-match and missed-match rates were calculated by comparing results of the HESID algorithm with the reference standard PICANet ID. The effect of linkage errors on readmission rate was evaluated. Results: Of 166 406 admissions, 88 596 were true matches (where the same patient had been readmitted). The HESID <b>pseudonymisation</b> algorithm produced few false matches (n= 176 / 77 810; 0. 2 %) but {{a larger proportion of}} missed matches (n= 3609 / 88 596; 4. 1 %). The true readmission rate was underestimated by 3. 8 % due to linkage errors. Patients who were younger, male, from Asian/Black/Other ethnic groups (vs White) were more likely to experience a false match. Missed matches were more common for younger patients, for Asian/Black/Other ethnic groups (vs White) and for patients whose records had missing data. Conclusions: The deterministic algorithm used to link all episodes of hospital care for the same patient in England has a high missed match rate which underestimates the true readmission rate and will produce biased analyses. To reduce linkage error, pseudoanonymisation algorithms need to be validated against good quality reference standards. <b>Pseudonymisation</b> of data ‘at source’ does not itself address errors in patient identifiers and the impact these errors have on data linkage...|$|E

40|$|Healthcare organisations {{practicing}} {{evidence-based medicine}} strive to unite their data assets {{in order to}} achieve a wider knowledge base for more sophisticated research as well as to provide a matured decision support service for the care givers. The central point of such an integrated system is a data warehouse, to which all participants have access. Due to the high confidentiality of healthcare data, and the privacy policy of participating organisations, the proposed warehouse is not created physically but as a federated system. Its conceptual model is based on a widely accepted international standard to overwhelm the heterogeneity of the components. Any disclosure of health data, especially when related to a particular person, could be irreparably harmful, and their protection is even legally prescribed.

40|$|New {{statistical}} {{methods have been}} developed for the longer-term storage of microdata. These methods must comply, however, with the fundamental right to informational self-determination and the legal regulations imposed by the Federal Constitutional Court. Thus it is crucial to develop effective and coherent methods for protecting personal data collected for statistical purposes. Recent decisions by the Federal Constitutional Court are likely to result in the outlawing of comprehensive, permanent statistical compilations comprised of microdata {{from a wide range of}} sources and updated regularly. However, aside from such comprehensive methods, there are certainly other ways of using microdata that cannot be dismissed from the outset as violating constitutional legal norms. Internet access to statistical microdata is likely to take on increased importance for scientific research in the near future. Yet this would radically change the entire landscape of data protection: the vast amount of additional information now available on the Internet makes it almost impossible to judge whether individuals can be rendered identifiable.

40|$|National audienceThe {{main problem}} faced by patients, health {{practitioners}} and the authorities, is namely the gathering and updating of administrative and medical data {{in order to}} accurately reconstitute a patient's medical history. Although solutions to accelerate and to ease this gathering are being implemented {{at the national level}} in several European countries, as unique health identifier in France, information still have to be validated before use. Through this article, we propose a mixed management of patients' data, split between the patient regarding administrative information and the Medical Practitioner (MP) regarding medical information. This method is based on two processes. The first process aims to obtain from health structures a list of probable cases of care provided to the patient. After validation by the patient (i. e. real or not care providing), the aim of the second process is to provide a patient's medical information and to validate it under the accountability of the MP {{with the help of the}} patient if needed. During these two processes, the patient's privacy will be ensured through cryptographic hash functions like the Secure Hash Algorithm, which allows <b>pseudonymisation</b> of a patient's identity. Our method, based on specific Medical Record Search Engines can lead to improved efficiency of personal medical record management regarding information gathering.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} our {{multidisciplinary}} study was to define a pragmatic and secure alternative {{to the creation of}} a national centralised medical record which could gather together the different parts of the medical record of a patient scattered in the different hospitals where he was hospitalised without any risk of breaching confidentiality. Methods We first analyse the reasons for the failure and the dangers of centralisation (i. e. difficulty to define a European patients' identifier, to reach a common standard for the contents of the medical record, for data protection) and then propose an alternative that uses the existing available data on the basis that setting up a safe though imperfect system could be better than continuing a quest for a mythical perfect information system that we have still not found after a search that has lasted two decades. Results We describe the functioning of Medical Record Search Engines (MRSEs), using <b>pseudonymisation</b> of patients' identity. The MRSE will be able to retrieve and to provide upon an MD's request all the available information concerning a patient who has been hospitalised in different hospitals without ever having access to the patient's identity. The drawback of this system is that the medical practitioner then has to read all of the information and to create his own synthesis and eventually to reject extra data. Conclusions Faced with the difficulties and the risks of setting up a centralised medical record system, a system that gathers all of the available information concerning a patient could be of great interest. This low-cost pragmatic alternative which could be developed quickly should be taken into consideration by health authorities...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} TRANSFoRm {{project a}} {{flexible}} zone model for data privacy in Primary Care research was developed. The model applies different privacy generating methods to {{different aspects of the}} research data flow and allows in this way for only minimal hindrance of research activities. This is achieved by defining three privacy zones, one for clinical care, research and data linking. Frameworks guaranteeing data privacy are often too stringent for research. TRANSFoRm develops a user-centered platform for the integration of Primary Care clinical and research activities. Because different health care and genetic databases will be accessed, TRANSFoRm has to assure that integration of clinical and genetic data is in full compliance with all legal and ethical requirements at European and national level. There exist already a couple of privacy frameworks for cancer research or biobanking (e. g. ACGT, GenoMatch). But most privacy frameworks apply the most stringent approach to their data flow and interpret “anonymisation” in a restrictive way. In our view, a flexible approach is needed to satisfy the different privacy needs of the heterogeneous data flow in TRANSFoRm that involves access to Primary Care health record data, genetic and clinical research databases and cancer registries. Dimensions of privacy in Primary Care research For this purpose we developed a flexible data privacy framework that is generic enough to be used by researchers with similar, but not identical, data sources. The model depicts a data type axis (identifying data, non-identifying data and genetic data), ethics axis (depending on national and database requirements: explicit consent, general consent, optout, ethics committee approval), de-identification axis (depending on the risk of identification and using different methods: full anonymisation, <b>pseudonymisation),</b> user restriction axis (levels of access control, authorization, explicit authorization). Based on an analysis of national and European legal requirements, and the access policies of different data bases, a privacy framework with data privacy profiles of different stringencies was created. Zone model for data privacy. For TRANSFoRm three different privacy profiles were transcribed into a zone model and applied to two use cases, addressing research on genotypephenotype relationships in Diabetes Mellitus, and research on the quality of care and treatment of Gastro-esophageal Reflux Disease. The first zone, the “primary care zone”, is concerned with the relationship between patient and GP, and the patient data contained in the eHR. The second zone contains the research data obtained by processes contained in the third, intermediate/linking zone. The linking zone guarantees the protection of the privacy of the link, but is itself not involved in the research data. Conclusion: Based on legal requirements and using all dimensions of a privacy framework, it is possible to develop a flexible zone model for Primary Care research that guarantees privacy and can support research...|$|E
