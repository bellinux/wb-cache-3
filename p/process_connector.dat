We describe specific challenges that we faced when building our prototype connector including the modeling of complex and semantically rich processes and their interactions, especially in light of different levels of detail and constraints that must be propagated across the processes. We report on some of the lessons learned from implementing our prototype and identify challenges and opportunities for future research. 1...|$|E

Process Driven Messaging Service gives you the logic to build your process by using triggers, jobs and workflows. Some companies uses an API where you build workflow/s and then connect various systems or mobile devices. You build the process, creating workflows in the API where the workflow in the API acts as a data exchange layer.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{focuses on}} Ultra High Density (UHD) {{stitching}} <b>process</b> of <b>connectors,</b> {{where the company}} relies on 100 % manual inspection in UHD connectors. Based on historical data on production of UHD connectors, typically labour cost involved in inspection and testing is around 15 % of the total manufacturing cost. This poses both challenges and opportunities for improvement in the bottleneck process, which is the inspection <b>process.</b> The female <b>connectors</b> quantity produced is on the average of 2000 parts/shift. It takes around 47 sec of visual inspection per connector and around 2. 89 sec per piece for go-gauge inspection. Considering these factors, {{the objectives of the}} study was to understand the whole process in its entirety and then use this knowledge to re-organize the stages staring from the automatic stitching process. By using process improvement tools of time study, methods and process mapping, a process re-orientation and re-organization has been carried out. This resulted in not only reduction of time of inspection and testing of the connectors, but also the piece inspection process reduced from an average total time of 112. 59 sec to 86. 15 sec. Overall improvement was also increased from 56 % to 79. 5 %. Index Terms—Process Mapping, Process Re-engineering, Ultra High Density. I...|$|R

40|$|In {{fiscal year}} 1993, tests of an o-ring/tetraseal {{retainer}} designed {{to replace a}} gasket-type seal used in PUREX-type <b>process</b> jumper <b>connectors</b> encouraged the design of an improved seal block. This new seal block combines several parts into one unitized component called an integral seal block. This report summarizes development and leak testing of the new integral seal block. The integral seal block uses a standard o-ring nested in a groove to accomplish leak tightness. This seal block eliminates the need to machine acme threads into the lower skirt casting and seal retainers, eliminates tolerance stack-up, reduces parts inventory, and eliminates an unnecessary leak path in the jumper connector assembly. This report also includes test data on various types of o-ring materials subjected to heat and pressure. Materials tested included Viton, Kalrez, and fluorosilicone, with some incidental data on teflon coated silicone o-rings. Test experience clearly demonstrates the need to test each seal material for temperature and pressure in its intended application. Some materials advertised as being {open_quotes}better{close_quotes} at higher temperatures did not perform up to expectations.

40|$|A {{business}} {{process is the}} combination of a set of activities with logical order and dependence, whose objective is to produce a desired goal. Business process modeling (BPM) using knowledge of the available process modeling techniques enable a common understanding and analysis of a {{business process}}. Industry and academics use informal and formal methods respectively to represent business processes (BP), having the main objective to support an organization. Despite both are aiming at BPM but the methods used are quite different in their semantics. While carrying out literature research, it has been found that there is no general representation of business process modeling is available that is expressive than the commercial modeling tools and techniques. Therefore, it is primarily conceived to provide an ontology mapping of modeling terms of Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN), Unified Modeling Language (UML) Activity Diagrams (AD) and Event Driven Process Chains (EPC) to temporal logic. Being a formal system, first order logic assists in thorough understanding of process modeling and its application. However, our contribution is to devise a versatile conceptual categorization of modeling terms/constructs and also formalizing them, based on well accepted business notions, such as action, event, <b>process,</b> sub-process, <b>connector</b> and flow. It is demonstrated that the new categorization of modeling terms mapped to formal temporal logic, provides the expressive power to subsume business process modeling techniques i. e. BPMN, UML AD and EPC...|$|R

40|$|For many companies, {{business}} processes {{have become the}} focal point of attention. As a result, many tools have been developed for business process engineering and the actual deployment of {{business processes}}. Typical examples of these tools are BPR (Business Process Reengineering) tools, ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems, and WFM (Workflow Management) systems. Some of the leading products, e. g. SAP R/ 3 (ERP/WFM) and ARIS (BPR), use Event-driven Process Chains (EPCs) to model business processes. Although event-driven process chains have become a widespread process modeling technique, they suffer from a serious drawback: neither the syntax nor the semantics of an event-driven process chain are well defined.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we solve the {{following}} problems: • we give a formal {{model of a}} large class of mereologies, with simple entities modelled as parts and their relations by connectors; • we show that that class applies {{to a wide variety}} of societal infrastructure component domains; • we show that there is a class of CSP channel and process structures that correspond to the class of mereologies where mereology parts become CSP <b>processes</b> and <b>connectors</b> become channels; and where simple entity attributes become process states. We have yet to prove to what extent the models satisfy the axiom systems for mereologies of, for example, [13] and a calculus of individuals [14]. Mereology is the study, knowledge and practice of part-hood relations: of the relations of part to whole and the relations of part to part within a whole. By parts we shall here understand simple entities — of the kind illustrated in this paper. Manifest simple entities of domains are either continuous (fluid, gaseous) or discrete (solid, fixed), and if the latter, then either atomic or composite. It is how the sub-entities of a composite entity are “put together ” that “makes up ” a mereology of that composite entity — at least such as we shall study the mereology concept. In this paper we shall study some ways of modelling the mereology of composite entities. One way of modelling mereologies is using sorts, observer functions and axioms (McCarthy style), another is using CSP...|$|R
40|$|The global {{marketplace}} {{is becoming more}} and more competitive, and business organizations need to team up and operate as virtual enterprises to best utilize their resources in achieving their shared business goals. Since the business environment of an enterprise is highly dynamic, it is necessary to develop a workflow management technology that is capable of handling dynamic workflows across enterprise boundaries. This paper proposes a Workflow Extension Model (WEM) and a dynamic workflow management system using WEM to model and control the execution of multi-organizational business processes. WEM enables the explicit specification of dynamic properties associated with a business process model. It extends the underlying <b>processes</b> by adding <b>connectors,</b> conditions of application, extension process definitions, and rules as modeling constructs. Using WEM as the underlying model, the paper also describes the workflow engine which is extended by an extension service to trigger extensions during the execution of a workflow process to enforce business rules and policies and to adapt the process model at run-time.

Dr. D’Esposito’s research investigates how the brain supports high-level cognitive processing, how the brain recovers from injury and potential treatments for the injured brain. He also practices Neurology at the Northern California VA Medical Center where he is the Chief of the NeuroRehabilitation Unit. Runtime: 62 : 50 minutesWhat type of system is the brain? The brain is widely assumed {{to be one of}} many modular systems in nature, which are thought to be computational tractable and favored by evolution. While focal brain lesions lead to very specific cognitive deficits, suggesting a modular structure, other focal lesions can have a widespread impact on cognition, suggesting that some cognitive processes emerge from interactions between many brain regions that are not functionally organized as modules. Thus, how information is functionally segregated yet integrated across modules remains an open question. In this talk, I will discuss a series of empirical findings that begin to elucidate the neural architecture of modular processing by showing that modules execute discrete <b>processes</b> and <b>connector</b> hubs are likely integrating and sending information across modules in support of goal-directed cognition...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explains}} how the increasingly popular social network driven ideation works for some companies, {{and how this}} can be expanded to encompass the complete crowdsourcing innovation process (beyond simple ideation). In a contemporary context, businesses that are unable {{to keep up with}} innovations are simply overrun by those who are more efficient at this. This results in the dilemma that confronts all innovating companies in the 21 st century: while innovation is critical for survival of a company, internal R&D is an inefficient approach to innovation. As a result of this dilemma, today?s innovative companies generally conduct little or no basic research on their own. They mostly innovate using the research discoveries of others. Some of these companies promote ideation forums on social networks to gain ?memes? for innovative ideas.

40|$|Clause {{connectors}} such as therefore or although {{are used}} in order to clarify complex coherence relations. This is particularly relevant in academic language {{which is based on}} written language. Therefore, the aim of the present three studies is to investigate primary school children’s comprehension of clause connectors. Based on results on the development of clause connector comprehension, we analyze at first whether the comprehension of different types of clause connectors changes during middle primary school. The results of study I reveal that children—regardless of their grade and family language—seem to <b>process</b> sentences containing <b>connectors</b> in a rather shallow way based on their world knowledge thereby disregarding the embedded connectors. In study II, this finding is confirmed by analyzing the children’s response patterns to items specifically constructed to investigate this assumption. The results support the conclusion that the children use a world knowledge strategy and barely take the connectors into account. Hence, it is tested in study III whether children do show basic clause connector knowledge in other tasks. The results indicate that this is thoroughly the case, even though inter-individual and connector-related differences become apparent. The findings are discussed with a view to the development of clause connector comprehension and the spontaneous use of the acquired clause connector knowledge...|$|R
40|$|The CONNECT Integrated Project aims at {{enabling}} continuous {{composition of}} networked systems, by developing techniques for synthesizing connectors. A prerequisite for synthesis {{is to learn}} about the interaction behavior of networked peers. The role of WP 4 is to develop techniques for learning models of networked peers and middleware through exploratory interaction. In this deliverable, we survey the CONNECT process in order to derive requirements for the participating learning techniques. We also report on a number of case studies from which such requirements are extracted. These include requirements on the ability to interact with the networked peer, whose behavior is being learned, as well as requirements on the learned model, in order that it can be used for subsequent manipulation in the CONNECT <b>process,</b> such as <b>connector</b> synthesis. A major challenge is to extract and maintain detailed information about the interface of the networked peer, as well as to relate this information to the produced model, in which abstractions have been employed in order to make synthesis tractable.

40|$|Today, the use {{of surface}} mount {{connectors}} to increase the component density of printed circuit boards is growing as a total percentage of <b>connectors</b> <b>processed</b> in various printed circuit boards. Resources have been channeled to develop various requirements pertaining to the design and processing of surface mount connectors. This paper summarizes {{some of the key}} developments in relation to the evolution of the pager design. Pagers have become small, cheap and reliable. With the drive towards smaller and slimmer pagers with increased functions, a two-printed-circuit-board-construction is needed for design flexibility due to the great variations in language and feature sets. What you can hold in your hand, you can drop. Therefore the pager (and the connector inside) must be mechanically rugged enough to take the various impacts in the course of its useful life and continue to function as designed. 2 To minimize the void area in the pager, the board-to-board connector stacked height is driven down to the height of the tallest components. Besides switching from through-hole to surface mount technology, connector density has been moved from 1. 27 mm to 1. 0 mm, and gradually to 0. 8 mm and 0. 5 mm pitch {{in order to meet the}} demands for miniaturization. Added to that, connectors also switched from pin-and-socket to blade-on-beam design technology to meet the demand for a robust system that can withstand physical shocks suffered by smaller, denser and more complex pagers. In conclusion, connectors will continue to evolve and remain one of the key elements in the evolution of packaging and interconnect solutions for pagers...|$|R
