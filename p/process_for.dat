5|$|Although the {{dominant}} use of iron is in metallurgy, iron compounds are also pervasive in industry. Iron catalysts are traditionally {{used in the}} Haber-Bosch <b>process</b> <b>for</b> the production of ammonia and the Fischer-Tropsch <b>process</b> <b>for</b> conversion of carbon monoxide to hydrocarbons for fuels and lubricants.

5|$|A {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} TB {{is made by}} identifying M. tuberculosis in a clinical sample (e.g., sputum, pus, or a tissue biopsy). However, the difficult culture <b>process</b> <b>for</b> this slow-growing organism can take two to six weeks for blood or sputum culture. Thus, treatment is often begun before cultures are confirmed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to a new area of research, namely: institutional preparedness of economic development agencies for developing {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs). The cases presented illustrate variations in the micro-finance lender agency-enterprise development of <b>processes</b> <b>for</b> sharing vision and interdependence. In clarifying the nature of the agency-enterprise relationship along these two dimensions, we develop a set of propositions. Our model contends 1 that effective <b>processes</b> <b>for</b> sharing vision and good cooperation maximise the likelihood of explication of tacit knowledge 2 that ineffective <b>processes</b> <b>for</b> sharing vision and good cooperation lead to ad hoc explication of tacit knowledge 3 ineffective <b>processes</b> <b>for</b> sharing vision and poor cooperation minimise the likelihood of explication of tacit knowledge 4 effective <b>processes</b> <b>for</b> sharing vision and poor cooperation maximise the likelihood of explication of tacit knowledge...|$|R
5|$|Another {{important}} {{development was}} in the <b>process</b> <b>for</b> discovery, the scientific method, focusing on empirical evidence {{and the importance of}} mathematics, while discarding Aristotelian science. Early and influential proponents of these ideas included Copernicus, Galileo, and Francis Bacon. The new scientific method led to great contributions in the fields of astronomy, physics, biology, and anatomy.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{examine the}} {{significance}} of formal <b>processes</b> <b>for</b> market information acquisition and use as antecedents to success of Chinese new ventures. Building on insights from the entrepreneurial planning literature, the authors construct a theoretical model in which formal <b>processes</b> <b>for</b> market information and market utilization have direct, positive main effects on new venture financial performance, and in which {{the existence of an}} established technology standard has a direct effect on performance and also affects the relationship between market information processes and performance. The authors test hypotheses derived from the model using a dataset comprising 222 Chinese new ventures. Consistent with expectations, the authors find that new venture financial performance was positively {{associated with the use of}} formal <b>processes</b> <b>for</b> the generation of market information. However, the impact on performance of formal <b>processes</b> <b>for</b> market information utilization depended on the firm's technological environment. In particular, for firms facing an established technology standard, the use of formal <b>processes</b> <b>for</b> market information utilization did not significantly affect performance. In contrast, the use of formal <b>processes</b> <b>for</b> market information utilization had a significant impact on performance among ventures that faced an emerging technology standard...|$|R
