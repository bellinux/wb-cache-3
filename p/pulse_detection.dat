40|$|Purpose. This study {{compared}} a new noncontact tonometer (NCT), the Nidek NT- 4. 000 (Nidek Co., Ltd., Aichi, Japan), with a <b>pulse</b> <b>detection</b> feature; {{an earlier}} model, the Nidek NT- 2000, without this <b>pulse</b> <b>detection</b> facility; and Goldmann tonometry. Methods. Thirty-one young subjects had their intraocular pressure (IOP) {{in one eye}} randomly measured by two NCT's, followed by a Goldmann tonometer. The <b>pulse</b> <b>detection</b> mode used by the NT- 4000 included synchronizing the IOP with {{the peak of the}} pulse (P-P), the middle of the pulse (P-M), or the bottom of the pulse (P-B). The order of measurements from these three modes was also random. Three consecutive readings were obtained from each mode/tonometer, and the mean was used for analysis. Results. Goldmann tonometry demonstrated the smallest variation from consecutive measurements (coefficient of variation, 5 %). For the NT- 4000, the mean IOP decreased from the highest in the P-P mode (16. 1 mm Hg) to the lowest in the P-B mode (14. 7 mm Hg), with the P-M mode in the middle. A significant difference was found among the IOP readings using the NT- 4000 (in various modes), NT- 2000, and Goldmann tonometry (repeated-measures analysis of variance, p < 0. 01). More than 80 % of the results from the NT- 4000 were within 3 mm Hg of those from the Goldmann tonometry. Conclusions. The <b>pulse</b> <b>detection</b> feature from this new NCT could capture and monitor pulse waves, thus reducing the variations in the consecutive measurements. The NT- 4000 also performed better than the NT- 2000 when compared with the Goldmann tonometry. School of Optometr...|$|E

Moreover, quantum bit error rates (QBERs) of multiphoton pulses can also be achieved precisely. Thus, our method is sensitive to the photon number splitting and resending (PNSR) attack, i. e., the eavesdropper (Eve) replaces one photon of the multiphoton pulse by a false one and forwards the pulse to the receiver, while the decoy-state protocols are not. In our scheme, Eve's whatever attacks will be limited by using the $improved$ decoy-state protocols and by checking the QBERs.

40|$|A {{model for}} quantum BER {{estimation}} in polarization encoded {{quantum key distribution}} systems is presented. Both TDM and WDM based polarization control schemes are analyzed. It is shown that TDM presents some important advantages {{when compared with the}} WDM control scheme. In WDM, the polarization decorrelation between the reference and data signals is an intrinsic and very limitative impairment. This effect has a contribution to quantum BER that increases with the propagation distance, and is highly dependent on the fiber polarization mode dispersion. In the TDM control scheme, the polarization decorrelation is less critical and other issues, like the single photon detector and feedback polarization control system performance tend to dominate.
