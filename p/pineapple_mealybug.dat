Microfiche. xiii, 116 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmWhen ants {{are managed}} in <b>pineapple</b> fields, the <b>mealybug</b> {{population}} rapidly declines. Why ants are so vital to <b>mealybug</b> survival in <b>pineapple</b> {{is the subject}} of this dissertation. Historically, three explanations were given for the importance of ants to <b>mealybugs</b> in <b>pineapple.</b> One hypothesis was that ants protect mealybugs from natural enemies. Another hypothesis was that ants perform an essential task for the mealybugs by consuming the mealybug honeydew, suggesting that mealybugs would drown in their own waste material were it not for the sanitation activities of the ants. According to another hypothesis ants are the primary or sole means of <b>mealybug</b> dispersal in <b>pineapple.</b> In other words, the ants actually bring the mealybugs into the field and distribute them from one pineapple plant to another. These explanations are frequently presented in the literature as facts, not hypotheses; although little supporting evidence has been published on the topic. Through a series of field and laboratory experiments I have provided evidence that: 1. Big-headed ants (BHA), Pheidole megacephala (F.), are essential for the survival of gray <b>pineapple</b> <b>mealybugs</b> (GPM), Dysmicoccus neobrevipes Beardsley, in pineapple fields. 2. BRA suppress predator populations. 3. BRA do not aid GPM through sanitation. 4. GPM are not dispersed by BRA. 5. First instar GPM are dispersed by the wind. In short, the data presented in this dissertation do not support the dispersal or sanitation hypothesis, but do support the hypothesis that BRA protect GPM from natural enemies. Thus, when ants are eradicated from a pineapple field, the resulting increase in predation (and possibly parasitization) of mealybugs brings wilt disease under control. The pineapple industry has unintentionally been relying on biological control for wilt management. Once the most efficient species of natural enemies are identified it should be possible to artificially augment their populations and reduce the need for insecticides. The discovery that GPM are dispersed by the wind will be useful for monitoring populations with sticky traps. Wind barriers and traps may be also be used to prevent, or decrease the severity of GPM infestations...|$|R

The cause of this disease has been linked to a toxin secreted by mealybugs during their feeding upon pineapple. The biological evidence supporting a viral etiology began to emerge in recent years. In this study I investigated the possible involvement of a virus with this disease by studying the association of dsRNA with infected plants, developing purification protocols for the closterovirus-like particles associated with mealybug-wilt infected pineapple, conducting detailed electron microscopic studie 6 of the virus leading to the determination of its physical properties such as length, width, and buoyant density. A polyclonal antiserum was produced to the virus isolated from pineapple and agar diffusion tests and serologically specific electron microscopic studies were conducted on this virus. The viral coat protein was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. That the antiserum produced was specific to the viral coat protein was shown by western blotting studies. Complementary DNA (cDNA) probes were developed and were used for the detection of virus in <b>pineapple</b> plants, <b>mealybugs,</b> and other plant species found commonly near commercial pineapple plantations. cDNA probes also were used in Northern blot analysis to detect subgenomic RNAs of viral origin in plant extracts obtained from diseased pineapple plants. cDNA probes developed were sensitive and virus was detected in wilt-affected pineapple plants as well as symptomless pineapple plants in the commercial plantations. The presence of virus also was detected in mealybugs taken from diseased pineapple plants and in a common grass species around pineapple plantations. The results of this study confirm the presence of a virus associated with "mealybug-wilted" pineapple plants.

At Poamoho, no mealybug wilt plants were found in plots where ants had been controlled, {{while the number of}} such plants increased sharply during the second crop in plots where ants were not controlled. The incidence of mealybug wilt was higher at the edges of plots than toward the middle reflecting the greater abundance of ants and mealybugs on the margins on the plots. Wilt spread in a contagious manner with the number of diseased plants increasing at a logrithmic rate over time. The coefficient of correlation between the number of ants caught in pitfall traps and the percentage of mealybug infested plants was very high (r = 0. 97). Infestation of the Molokai experimental planting by big-headed ants started at the edges of plantings adjacent to abandoned fields and waste areas. Invasion progressed slowly, and two and one half years elapsed before all plots had become infested. Ant and mealybug populations in infested plots increased gradually and appeared to be strongly influenced by the phenology of the pineapple plants during the first fruit crop.

High mealybug densities promote the occurrence of MWP, an important disease limiting pineapple production. In the absence of ants, such as the big-headed ant, Pheidole megacephala (Fabricius), mealybug densities are usually low. However, in the presence of ants, mealybug densities on pineapple may reach damaging levels, and ultimately result in the occurrence of MWP. Several theories have been proposed to explain the relationships among the mealybugs and the ants. Studies were undertaken to better define the role of established biological control agents in suppressing mealybug populations in Hawaii. In surveys in abandoned pineapple fields on the Hawaiian islands of Oahu and Maui from July 1992 to November 1993, mealybug densities ranged from a mean of 22 to 157 mealybugs per plant. P. megacephala was the dominant ant species found. Five natural enemy species, previously introduced into Hawaii for mealybug control, were associated with D. brevipes and D. neobrevipes. Anagyrus ananatis Gahan (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) was the most common parasitoid associated with D. brevipes. The only predators that appeared to have any potential were Nephus bilucernarius Mulsant (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and Lobodiplosis pseudococci (Felt.) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae). Field evaluation studies using the biological check method suggested that A. ananatis was predominantly responsible for the decline of D. brevipes densities in the absence of ants. A study combining the biological check method and the paired-cage exclusion technique indicated that in the absence of P. megacephala, D. brevipes densities were heavily impacted by natural enemies and probably the lack of sanitation (e. g., honeydew removal). Laboratory studies indicated that P. megacephala significantly decreased mealybug parasitization and predation by adult A. ananatis and N. bilucernarius by 73 and 48 percent, respectively. Biological studies were conducted on A. ananatis and N. bilucernarius to define and quantify biological characteristics such as mealybug host and stage preference, developmental times, longevity and fecundity.

In {{the presence of}} PMWaV, feeding by PPM induces Mealybug Wilt of Pineapple, which can completely devastate a pineapple planting if PPM is not managed. Studies were conducted to develop an augmentative biological control program for PPM management using the encrytid endoparasitoid Anagyrus ananatis Gahan. Use of vermiculite in PPM rearing protocols effectively removed PPM generated honeydew that commonly entrapped mealybugs and interfered with collection of PPM individuals from squash. Infestation of Kobocha squash with mature adult PPM produced more than 2200 mature adult PPM (≥ 0. 6 mg) per kg squash in about 8 weeks. The size of parasitized PPM significantly affected A. ananatis body size, which partially determined the parasitoid's reproductive ability. PPM weighing ≥ 0. 6 mg produced normal sized A. ananatis. The lower developmental threshold (To) for A. ananatis was 12. 65 °C. Total heat accumulation required for development from egg to adult was 265 and 275 Degree Days (DD) for males and females, respectively. Eggs began hatching after accumulating 22 DD and larval development was completed after 88 - 110 DD. Anagyrus ananatis pupae can be stored at 10. 1 °C (below the To) for one week, if preconditioned at 14. 8 °C (above the To) for one week, without significant effects on their survival and reproductive abilities. Big headed ant (BHA), Pheidole megacephala F. (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), effectively reduced A. ananatis parasitization of PPM to almost half of that recorded in its absence. Increased A. ananatis densities increased PPM parasitization {{in the presence of}} BHA, which suggested that augmentative field releases might help suppress PPM even when ants are present. The disruptive effects of BHA on A. ananatis parasitism could potentially be neutralized by doubling (via augmentative release) the densities of A. ananatis that provide effective PPM suppression in the absence of BHA. The most common weed hosts of PPM included rhodes grass, Chloris gayana, and wire grass, Eleusine indica, which were found in both mowed and unmowed weed bands within disturbed areas around pineapple plantings.

Molecular phylogeny based on partial DNA sequences in the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, as well as the endosymbiotic bacterial genome, revealed that the asexual lineage diverged from a common sexual ancestor in the relatively recent past. In contrast, only the asexual lineage exhibiting obligate apomictic thelytoky was discovered on Ishigaki. Co-existence of the two lineages cannot be explained by the results of laboratory experiments, which showed that the intrinsic rate of increase in the sexual lineage was not obviously superior to that of the asexual lineage.

Microfiche. xiii, 89 leaves ill. 29 cmThis {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to (1) obtain {{a better understanding}} of the interrelationship of ants, mealybug, and mealybug wilt disease of pineapple in Hawaii, and (2) to develop alternative methods of ant control. The study was in three parts: 1) a follow-up study of the epidemiology of mealybug wilt in a pineapple field at Poamoho, Oahu, Hawaii, Which was previously used for a study on the biology and ecology of big-headed ant, Pheido 1 e megacephala (Fabricius), and the gray <b>pineapple</b> <b>mealybug,</b> Dysmicoccus neobrevipes Beardsley, the two most important insects associated with the mealybug wilt of pineapple; 2) laboratory screening of potentially useful insecticide compounds for possible use as ant baits or as broadcast spray; and 3) field tests of promising ant baits and broadcast spray for ant control on the Island of Molokai. The population density of the big-headed ant was higher during the second crop than during the first crop of pineapple at both Poamoho and Molokai. No mealybug wilt plants were found in plots with excellent ant control, while the number of mealybug wilt plants increased sharply during the second crop in blocks where ants were not controlled. The incidence of mealybug wilt was higher at the edge of the plot than toward the middle of the field. Infestation of the Mo 10 kai experimental planting (20. 3 ha divided into 102 0. 2 -ha plots) by big-headed ants started at the edge of the planting adjacent to an abandoned field and along a waste area. The ant dispersal and percentage of ant infested plots increased progressively with the age of the pineapples. A baited stake technique is described for use of evaluation of big-headed ant populations. Soybean oil mixed with peanut butter (50 : 50) was the most attractive bait material of all those tested for the big-headed ant workers. The greatest foraging activity of the ant occurred after sunset. Sixteen pesticides were selected from laboratory screening tests and tested as baits. Baits of AC 217300 (2 (1 H) -Pyrimidinone, tetrahydro- 5, 5 -dimethyl-, [3 - 4 -(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]- 1 -[2 -[4 (trifluoromethyl) phenyl]=ethenyl]- 2 -propenylidene]hydrazone) were acceptable to the ant and were more effective than any of the other pesticides studied. Field tests were conducted with baits of AC 217300 (85 % corncob grits, 15 % soybean oil, and AC 217300 at concentration of 1500 to 7500 ppm) at a rate of 2. 24 kg bait per hectare. Results showed that the baits at 7500 ppm were as effective as mirex baits (0. 3 %) for controlling ~. megacephala. Broadcast sprays of 8 insecticides were applied for control of P. megacephala in the pineapple field at Molokai. Carbofuran, chlordane, diazinon, fonofos, heptachlor, and acephate all gave a high initial kill of the ants one day after the treatment. However, five months after the treatment, only heptachlor and chlordane continued to give good control of the ants. Tests with diazinon and acephate showed that their effectiveness was affected by the size of the pineapple plants. Additional tests with acephate indicated it has some promise for ant control. Pest management strategies for control of <b>pineapple</b> <b>mealybug</b> wilt disease are discussed. Information of ant movement would be useful in ant control programs. Destroying ants and mealybugs along edges of pineapple plantings may prevent pest migrations into newly planted fields. Use of insecticides only at the periphery of the fields and in uncultivated areas contiguous with new plantings may effectively control the ants, thus minimizing the overall use of insecticides...|$|E
40|$|A {{double-stranded}} RNA (dsRNA) ca. 19 kb in {{size was}} {{recovered from a}} fig tree of Algerian origin (F 3) showing chlorotic mottling of the leaves and clearing of {{the second and third}} veins. Filamentous closterovirus-like particles up to 2100 nm in length and with distinct cross banding were observed in leaf dips. Cytopatholo-gy of thin sectioned phloem cells was similar to that elicited by members of the family Closteroviridae. RT-PCR assays with primers specific to the recently de-scribed Fig leaf mottle-associated virus (FLMaV) were negative. No virus was recovered by mechanical inocu-lation to herbaceous hosts. Using denatured F 3 dsRNA preparations as template, a 625 bp cDNA fragment was amplified by RT-PCR using degenerate primers de-signed on the phosphate motifs 1 and 2 of the heat shock-protein 70 homologue (HSP 70) of members of the family Closteroviridae. Sequence analysis demon-strated that the sequenced 625 bp fragment was part of a closteroviral HSP 70 gene, with sequence identity to FLMaV of ca. 45 % and 28 % at the nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively. Comparison with the HSP 70 amino acid sequences of other closteroviral species showed homologies of 48 %, 37 % or 36 % with Little cherry virus 2 (LChV- 2,) Grapevine leafroll-associ-ated virus 1 (GLRaV- 1) and <b>Pineapple</b> <b>mealybug</b> wilt-as-sociated virus 2 (PMWaV- 2), respectively. In a phyloge-netic tree constructed with the amino acid sequences of the HSP 70 genes of several members of the family Clos-teroviridae, isolate F 3 clustered with members of the genus Ampelovirus. In RT-PCR assays with specific primers designed to match the F 3 HSP 70 sequence, 4 of 57 field-grown Italian figs trees yielded amplicons of the expected size, while Multiplex-PCR proved effective for the simultaneous detection of double infections by FLMaV and isolate F 3. The different sizes of dsRNA and virus particle lengths of F 3 and FLMaV, the low se-quence homology of the F 3 HSP 70 gene with that o...|$|E
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. Mealybug wilt of {{pineapple}} (MWP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} destructive diseases of pineapple worldwide. A complex of <b>pineapple</b> <b>mealybug</b> wilt associated viruses (PMWaVs), all of which belong to the genus Ampelovirus (Family: Closteroviridae) have been identified in pineapple growing regions throughout the world. Three of these viruses, PMWaV- 1, PMWaV- 2, PMWaV- 3 have been characterized. The disease etiology of MWP is still not completely resolved. To better understand the complex etiology of mealybug wilt of pineapple (MWP), it is essential that the genomes of PMWaVs be functionally characterized. In Hawaii, PMWaV- 2 has an important role in the etiology of MWP, causing severe wilt symptoms and yield reductions in the presence of mealybug feeding, whereas infection by PMWaV- 1 alone, with or without mealybug feeding, may cause some yield reduction but does not produce wilt symptoms. Higher plants use RNA silencing to defend against viral infections. As a counter defense, plant viruses have evolved proteins that suppress RNA silencing. In this study selected open reading frames (ORFs) of PMWaV- 1 and PMWaV- 2 were screened for their local and systemic suppressor activities in Agrobacterium-mediated transient assays using green fluorescent protein (GFP) in Nicotiana benthamiana. Results indicate that PMWaV- 2 utilizes a multiplecomponent RNA silencing suppression mechanism. Two of the encoded proteins analyzed, p 20 and CP, target both local and systemic silencing in N. benthamiana, whereas p 22 and CPd targets only systemic silencing. In the related virus PMWaV- 1, we found that only one of the encoded proteins analyzed, p 61, had systemic suppressor activity. Of all the proteins tested from both viruses, only PMWaV- 2 p 20 suppressed local silencing induced by doublestranded (ds) RNA, but only when low levels of inducing dsRNA were used. None of the proteins analyzed showed an ability to interfere with the short distance systemic spread of silencing. We examined the mechanism of systemic suppression activity by investigating the effect of PMWaV- 2 -encoded p 20 and CP proteins on secondary siRNAs. Our results suggest that PMWaV- 2 p 20 and CP (and probably other proteins) block the systemic silencing signal by repressing production of secondary siRNAs. We also demonstrate that PMWaV- 2 p 20 and p 22 enhanced Potato virus X pathogenicity in N. benthamiana. The construction of a full-length and less than full length PMWaV- 1 clone has been reported. The toxicity of certain region of the cloned PMWaV- 1 genome in E. coli induced lethal mutations and re-arrangements, which might be the reason for its non-infectivity in N. benthamiana. A cell-free method, Circular polymerase extension cloning (CPEC) of creating infectious clone has been adapted successfully for the first time for a Potato virus X, plant virus. However technical refinement would require the making of an infectious clone of PMWaV- 1. Considering the importance of PMWaV- 2 in the disease etiology of MWP, a highly sensitive detection assay using a single closed tube nested PCR technique has been developed which can be used to detect very low PMWaV- 2 titer in diseased plants and insects. The assay is made more flexible by inclusion of a Taqman® probe to make the assay quantitative...|$|E
