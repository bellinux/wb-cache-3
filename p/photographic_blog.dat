Slimane created his Rock Diary, {{beginning}} in 2004 {{in collaboration with}} the British journalist from NME, Alex Needham. In addition, he shot spreads for magazines including French Vogue, VMAN, and Purple.|$|E

This early piece launched {{her career as a}} visual artist as {{it was one of the}} first interactive pieces on the internet at the time and created before the fashion of <b>photographic</b> diaries via <b>blogs</b> would start spreading worldwide in 2004. In retrospect, it could be considered an art piece very much about growing up on the Autism Spectrum and struggling with a personal quest of identity. This work has received two awards and has been exhibited internationally in art galleries and museums.|$|R

The research question is centred on ‘What does the interactive function of a web 2. 0 blogging experience make available {{in terms of a}} child’s pedagogic rights?’ This instrumental case study is made up of 56 written and <b>photographic</b> travel <b>blog</b> posts covering some 11, 411 words and 150 photos over 170 [*]days, as well as the 187 replies from external blog participants. Background information about the child, his family and the context of the blogging project is provided via an informal interview with him and his mother. An analytical framework capable of rendering visible what the travel blog project made available in terms of the three pedagogic rights of individual enhancement, the right of social inclusion and the right to political participation is developed and activated. Two core findings emerge. First, in this blogging experience, the pedagogic rights of individual enhancement (80 % of posts) and social inclusion (96 % of posts) dominated the right to political participation (39 % of posts). Second, despite claims that the interactive function of web 2. 0 has the potential to boost individualism of meaning-making and action, in this case, the blogging experience did not always manifest itself to capitalise on the transformative potential of this experience for this young child travel blogger...|$|R

An analytical framework capable of rendering visible what the travel blog project made available in terms of the three pedagogic rights of individual enhancement, the right of social inclusion and the right to political participation is developed and activated (Bernstein, 2000; Exley et al., 2016).
