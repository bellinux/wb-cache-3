The proposed method, which characterizes oxide interface states by applying pulse frequencies up to the GHz range, is {{used to evaluate the}} evolution of interface states due to dynamic negative bias temperature instability stress on the <b>p-channel</b> <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistor</b> (pFET). The results show that charge pumping increases linearly at frequencies up to the GHz range and that the time dependence of interface states due to AC negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) stress increases with a power law distribution. In addition, we demonstrate experimentally that the VTH shift due to AC NBTI stress depends on interface states and oxide traps. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author’s final draft...|$|E
40|$|The Depleted <b>P-channel</b> <b>Field-Effect</b> <b>Transistor</b> {{detector}} is a pixel detector type {{currently under}} development. In high energy physics, pixel detectors measure space {{points along the}} trajectory of charged particles. They determine the spatial position by measuring the charges created {{as a result of}} interactions with the passing particle. Thus the detector’s signals can be used to determine the energy deposited by the particle in single pixels of a pixel matrix. The development of a new detector raises the question whether our simulation models can accurately describe the physical processes – like ionisation and scattering – taking place during operation. The thesis aims to validate one of the current Monte-Carlo simulations (based on the Geant 4 simulation package) of high energy straggling processes using experimental data of a test beam run of DEPFET modules. This is done by calculating the spatial distribution of the electron/hole pairs created in extreme cases of ionisation and using this distribution for comparison and analysis of the data samples...|$|E
40|$|Radiation is {{all around}} us {{and most of the}} time we are not able to see it, {{nevertheless}} it brings us valuable information about the world we live in, so it is very important to be able to detect it with high accuracy. This thesis explores the ways and brings solutions of improving performance and manufacturing of solid-state radiation detectors which are used for detecting photons (electromagnetic radiation) within various energy ranges: near-infrared light, visible light, ultraviolet light, x-ray and gamma radiation. Solid-state radiation detectors have been under active development during the last 30 years. The development has been driven by needs of better spatial and energy resolution, higher readout speeds, and higher particle densities in fields and applications dealing with photon detection. Radiation detectors have been evolving as new technologies were becoming available, as a result, more and more sophisticated detectors and systems of detectors were made available. Nowadays, semiconductor detectors are used in a large variety of fields: science, including nuclear physics, elementary particle physics, optical and x-ray astronomy, material testing; medicine, image sensors, technology and consumer applications. The number of applications grows continually. There is a constant demand for solid-state radiation detector performance improvement from all the fields where they are used. The performance of a solid-state detector has improved significantly for last 30 years and nowadays there are many various concepts of a solid-state detector which are used in various applications: pin-photodiode, silicon drift detector, depleted <b>p-channel</b> <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistor,</b> charge coupled device, etc. But there is still room for improvement. The goal of this work was to address known challenges and improve performance and manufacturability of solid-state radiation detectors. As a result, several new concepts of solid-state detectors were developed. Performance of new structures was verified by 2 D and 3 D process and device simulations in Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) software. Proposed concepts considerably improve performance of solid-state radiation detectors in terms of removing issues with interface generated dark noise, reducing interface generated 1 /f noise, reducing interface generated Random Telegraph Signal, improving quantum efficiency, reducing cross-talk, and improving signal-to-noise ratio. Developed concepts also make manufacturing of radiation-detectors easier since for most of the concepts a standard CMOS process can be used. Another valuable feature is a possibility of using another semiconductor materials, like for example germanium for manufacturing the same radiation detectors which was not possible previously due to interface related issues...|$|E
