5|$|The ships, {{named after}} provinces of France, were never {{completed}} due to shifting <b>production</b> <b>requirements</b> after {{the outbreak of}} war in 1914. The first four ships were sufficiently advanced in construction to permit their launching to clear the shipyards for other, more important work. Many of the guns built for the ships were instead converted {{for use by the}} Army. After the war, the French Navy considered several proposals to complete the ships, either as originally designed or modernized to account for lessons from the war. The weak French post-war economy, however, necessitated that the first four ships be broken up for scrap. The last ship, which was not significantly advanced at the time work halted, was converted into an aircraft carrier in the 1920s. She remained in service in various capacities until the 1960s. The ship was ultimately scrapped in 1967.|$|E

25|$|Heijunka: {{production}} smoothing presupposes a level {{strategy for the}} MPS and a final assembly schedule developed from the MPS by smoothing aggregate <b>production</b> <b>requirements</b> in smaller time buckets and sequencing final assembly to achieve repetitive manufacturing. If these conditions are met, expected throughput can be equaled to the inverse of takt time. Besides volume, heijunka also means attaining mixed model production, which however may only be feasible through set-up reduction. A standard tool for achieving this is the Heijunka box.|$|E

50|$|The {{creation}} of a new Group 4 Special Grand Touring Car category in 1970 saw Group 3 renamed as Series Production Grand Touring Cars and the minimum <b>production</b> <b>requirement</b> increased to 1000 units. Group 4, which allowed a greater degree of modification to the competing vehicles, had its minimum <b>production</b> <b>requirement</b> set at 500 units. Both GT categories were eligible to compete in the International Championship for Makes and then, from 1972, in the renamed World Championship of Makes. The International Cup for GT Cars also continued. In 1976 the World Championship of Makes was restricted to production derived cars (FIA Groups 1 to 5) and the International Cup for GT Cars was discontinued in that year.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 1966, the FIA’s Group 4 {{classification}} {{applied to}} Sports Cars {{which were in}} compliance with FIA Appendix C regulations. It also included recognised Series Touring Cars, Improved Touring Cars and Grand Touring Cars which had been modified beyond the respective Group 1, Group 2 or Group 3 regulations under {{which they had been}} homologated. In 1966, an overhaul of FIA categories saw Group 4 Sports Cars redefined such that they were now subject to a minimum <b>production</b> <b>requirement</b> of 50 units in 12 consecutive months and had to be fitted with all equipment necessary for use on public roads. A 5000cc engine capacity limit was applied for 1968 and the minimum <b>production</b> <b>requirement</b> was reduced to 25 units for the 1969 season.|$|R
25|$|Because {{of safety}} issues, {{phosgene}} is often produced and consumed {{within the same}} plant, and extraordinary measures are made to contain it. It is listed on schedule 3 of the Chemical Weapons Convention: All production sites manufacturing more than 30 tonnes per year must be declared to the OPCW. Although less dangerous than many other chemical weapons, such as sarin, phosgene is still regarded as a viable chemical warfare agent {{because it is so}} easy to manufacture when compared to the <b>production</b> <b>requirements</b> of more technically advanced chemical weapons such as the first-generation nerve agent tabun.|$|E
25|$|The {{nutritional}} requirements of cattle are usually divided into maintenance requirements, which {{depend on the}} cow’s weight; and milk <b>production</b> <b>requirements,</b> which in turn depend on the volume of milk the cow is producing. The nutritional contents of each available feed are used to formulate a diet that meets all nutritional needs in the most cost effective way. Notably, cattle must be fed a diet high in fiber to maintain a proper environment for the rumen microbes. Farmers typically grow their own forage for their cattle. Crops grown may include corn, alfalfa, timothy, wheat, oats, sorghum and clover. These plants are often processed after harvest to preserve or improve nutrient value and prevent spoiling. Corn, alfalfa, wheat, oats, and sorghum crops are often anaerobically fermented to create silage. Many crops such as alfalfa, timothy, oats, and clover are allowed to dry in the field after cutting before being baled into hay.|$|E
25|$|The AWPD {{went beyond}} {{offering}} basic <b>production</b> <b>requirements</b> and provided instead a comprehensive air plan {{which was designed}} to defeat the Axis powers. The plan, AWPD-1, was completed in nine days. The plan emphasized using heavy bombers to carry out precision bombing attacks as the primary method of defeating Germany and her allies. A year later, after the United States became directly involved in World War II, AWPD delivered a second plan—AWPD-42—which slightly changed the earlier plan to incorporate lessons learned from eight months of war. Neither AWPD-1 nor AWPD-42 were approved as combat battle plans or war operations; they were simply accepted as guidelines for the production of materiel and the creation of necessary air squadrons. Finally in 1943, an operational aerial warfare plan was hammered out in meetings between American and British war planners, based on a combination of British plans and those from the AWPD, to create the Anglo-American Combined Bomber Offensive (CBO).|$|E

25|$|The 29th/46th Battalion was an {{infantry}} {{battalion of}} the Australian Army. It {{was formed in}} August 1942 by the amalgamation of two previously existing Militia battalions, the 29th and 46th, which were merged following {{a decision by the}} Australian government to release manpower from the military back into industry to meet the nation's increased <b>production</b> <b>requirements.</b> Initially the 29th/46th, serving as part of the 4th Brigade, undertook garrison duties in Australia, however, in 1943 the battalion was deployed to New Guinea where it garrisoned Milne Bay before subsequently taking part in the Huon Peninsula campaign in support of the 9th Division. In late 1944, after being deployed for over a year and a half, the battalion returned to Australia for a brief period of leave and reorganisation. In early 1945, however, they were again deployed overseas, this time to the island of New Britain where they undertook a campaign to contain the large Japanese garrison. Following {{the end of the war}} the battalion was disbanded in June 1946.|$|E
500|$|SMS Bayern was {{the lead}} ship of the [...] of battleships in the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy). The vessel was {{launched}} in February 1915 and entered service in July 1916, too late {{to take part in}} the Battle of Jutland. Her main armament consisted of eight 38cm (15in) guns in four turrets, which was a significant improvement over the preceding s ten 30.5cm (12inch) guns. The ship was to have formed the nucleus for a fourth battle squadron in the High Seas Fleet, along with three of her sister ships. Of the other ships only one——was completed; the other two were canceled later in the war when <b>production</b> <b>requirements</b> shifted to U-boat construction.|$|E
500|$|The Air War Plans Division was {{tasked with}} {{developing}} a <b>production</b> <b>requirements</b> plan for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who wanted it by 10 September 1941. In just nine days in August 1941, George, Olds, Fairchild, Walker, Kuter and Hansell drafted the AWPD-1 {{plan for a}} war against Germany. Reflecting their belief in bombardment as the principal form of aviation, the plan was based upon the number of bombers that they estimated {{would be required to}} knock out Germany's key industries – electric power, transportation and petroleum. [...] In order to neutralize anticipated opposition from the German Air Force, they planned for bombing aircraft factories and the sources of the light metals needed for aircraft production. These targets were collated along with the estimated tonnage of bombs required to destroy them.|$|E

500|$|Walker {{joined the}} United States Army in 1917, after the American entry into World War I. He trained as an aviator {{and became a}} flying instructor. In 1920, {{after the end of}} the war, he {{received}} a commission in the Regular Army. After service in various capacities, Walker graduated from the Air Corps Tactical School in 1929, and then served as an instructor there. He supported the creation of a separate air organization that is not subordinate to other military branches. [...] He was a forceful advocate of the efficacy of strategic bombardment, publishing articles on the subject and becoming part of a clique known as the [...] "Bomber Mafia" [...] that argued for the primacy of bombardment over other forms of military aviation. He advanced the notion that fighters could not prevent a bombing attack. [...] He participated in the [...] Air Corps Tactical School's development of the doctrine of industrial web theory, which called for precision attacks against carefully selected critical industrial targets. Shortly before the United States entered World War II, Walker became one of four officers assigned to [...] the Air War Plans Division, which was tasked with developing a <b>production</b> <b>requirements</b> plan for the war in the air. Together, these officers devised the AWPD-1 plan, a blueprint for the imminent air war against Germany that called for the creation of an enormous air force to win the war through strategic bombardment.|$|E
500|$|According to Miyamoto, Pilotwings 64 was {{designed}} to allow gamers to experience free flight in realistic 3D environments on the Nintendo 64. Prior to the game's conception, Paradigm had worked on military vehicle and flight simulators, but not video games. Dave Gatchel of Paradigm disclosed that with regard to creating the game, they began with a [...] "physics-based approach", but deviated from this {{in order to gain}} a balance between accuracy and fun for players. He indicated that there was never an issue as to whether Pilotwings 64 should be more of an arcade game or a simulation, as their goal was to [...] "always have a more arcade feel". The technical team studied the original Pilotwings extensively during development. Pilotwings on the SNES makes use {{of the power of the}} 16-bit console, principally its Mode 7 capability. Similarly, Pilotwings 64 prominently demonstrates the graphical features of its own console. Gatchel suggested that just as design elements present in the game generated its <b>production</b> <b>requirements,</b> these same elements were influenced by the Nintendo 64's technology during development. The large islands within the game were created using Paradigm's own 3D development tool Vega UltraVision. Navigation of these environments is relatively smooth thanks to Pilotwings 64 taking advantage of several key Nintendo 64 hardware features. Conventional level of detail and mipmapping were used to reduce the computational load of distant landscape objects and terrains when they were rendered. The processes respectively substitute simpler geometrical shapes for more complex ones and less detailed textures for more detailed ones, lowering the polygon count and 3D rendering time for a given frame and thus putting less demand on the geometric engine. Pilotwings 64 also applies z-buffering, which keeps track of an object's depth and tells the graphics processor which portions of the object to render and which to hide. This, along with texture filtering and anti-aliasing, makes the object appear solid and smooth along its edges rather than pixelated.|$|E
