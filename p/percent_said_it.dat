40|$|Teenagers in India {{tend to be}} poorly {{informed}} about their bodies and matters related to sexuality and health. The information they have is often incomplete and hence, they are confused. According to Planning Commission of India, teenagers are about one fourth {{of the total population}} and have major implication for the future, since reproductive and sexual behavior during adolescence have far reaching effects. This is especially relevant in India where reproductive health has been considered synonymous with women’s health and hence reproductive health of men has received little attention. Typically boys are neither encouraged to talk about pubertal changes nor offered space to ask questions or seek information about these changes. The present study is based on a cross sectional survey conducted in Varanasi during 2010 - 11 for assessing the knowledge and attitude of teenage boys about pubertal changes, nocturnal ejaculation and masturbation. A total of 542 teenager boys belonging to the age group of 14 - 20 years were actively interviewed with structured questionnaire. Among study participants, 90 <b>percent</b> <b>said</b> that they experienced puberty. The mean age of first nocturnal ejaculation was 15 years with minimum 14 years and maximum 17 years, and 38 <b>percent</b> <b>said</b> that <b>it</b> is a natural process. About 52 <b>percent</b> participants <b>said</b> that this is a sign of masculinity, 11 <b>percent</b> <b>said</b> that this is harmful to body and related to diseases.

40|$|A poll from The Pew Charitable Trusts {{shows that}} many Philadelphians {{are not aware}} of the city's new {{property}} tax system and that those who are aware are skeptical about the structure. Little {{more than half of the}} 1, 605 residents surveyed said they knew about the new system, known as the Actual Value Initiative or AVI, which was enacted by the City Council this year after several years of consideration. Among those who are aware of AVI, 44 percent believed it would make real estate taxes less fair, compared with 26 <b>percent</b> who <b>said</b> <b>it</b> would make real estate taxes more equitable.

As for future revisions in the tax system, residents said they favored a concept long advocated by leaders of the business community and others: reducing local taxes on wages and businesses as a way to spur job creation. The ratio of support was well over 2 -to- 1. But they opposed the idea of raising property taxes to help make up for any resulting budget gaps by a ratio of nearly 2 -to- 1...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Safe {{drinking}} water is scarce in Kolkata. Inadequate knowledge and poor practices of storing and cleaning {{drinking water}} can cause severe {{effects on the}} health of the population. There is a need to understand the current trend of attitudes and practices of individuals living in urban slums to reduce water-borne diseases and mortality. This limited convenience sample study attempted to explore and identify areas for further study regarding the barriers of clean water access in urban slums of Kolkata, India. Methods: This pilot cross-sectional study was conducted in Kolkata, India during July 2014. Five urban slums were selected based on proximity and cooperation from the community. A sample of 50 women was taken, representing the five slums, with a sample of 10 women taken from each slum. Results: The majority (80 %) of the participants said they regularly have enough water available {{to meet the needs of}} their household. Fifty-two percent of subjects received their water for drinking from a tap, hand pump, or time pump. Thirty percent had water pumped into their homes, and 18 % purchased their water from a water truck. Fourteen <b>percent</b> <b>said</b> they did not treat their water because it was too time consuming, 40 % <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was too much work, and 34 % <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was not needed. Ninety <b>percent</b> <b>said</b> they felt <b>it</b> was important to clean their water, almost half (48 %) thought their water was not clean, but only 42 % used some method to clean their water. Many subjects (68 %) stated they knew how to clean their water, but 66 % were unaware that visible dirt is not an indicator of illness-causing bacteria in water. Conclusions: More focus should be directed towards improving awareness and knowledge and changing attitudes, motivation, and perceived susceptibility to disease from water within slum communities in Kolkata, India...|$|R

40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to The University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Medicine. Objective: There is a disparity in physician to population ratios between rural and urban Arizona. The University of Arizona Medical School has {{a unique opportunity to}} increase the supply of physicians serving in rural Arizona through its admissions process. This study is a quality improvement project which examined whether or not the admission committee members at both the Tucson and Phoenix campuses are considering probability of future rural practice when making admission decisions and if they know the evidence based predictors for rural practice. Methods: The admission committee members from the University of Arizona Medical School were asked to fill out a questionnaire regarding their preferences for future rural practitioners and if they knew the two most accurate predictors for rural practice. Results: There were 22 respondents to the survey- 12 out of 13 from Phoenix and 10 out of 14 from Tucson. Fifty-nine percent (n= 13) of the total respondents listed likelihood to practice in a rural community as positively affecting their admission decision, 27 <b>percent</b> (n= 6) <b>said</b> <b>it</b> does not affect their decision at all, and 13 <b>percent</b> (n= 3) <b>said</b> <b>it</b> affects their decision very positively. All 22 respondents correctly identified rural background as one of the two strongest predictors of rural practice while 11 correctly identified stated interest in family practice as the other. Conclusion: The University of Arizona Medical School admissions committees are well positioned to increase the supply of rural physicians in Arizona. Even still, some {{of the members of the}} committee could benefit from education regarding accurate predictors of rural practice...|$|R
