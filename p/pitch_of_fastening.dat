40|$|The idea of “hybrid joints” {{arises from}} the need of joining {{together}} materials, producing a tough, stiff and lightweight joint. The core concept is: use two different joining techniques, with the aim to increase the strength and gather the advantages of each technique, reducing the drawbacks. In this work hybrid joints consist in joints produced with two different kinds of joining techniques: one of them being adhesive bonding and the other being one among Resistance Spot Welding, Pop Riveting, Clinching, Self Piercing Riveting. The performance of hybrid joints are {{compared with those of}} traditional joints for the single lap joint geometry, for different geometric (plates thickness, <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the mechanical <b>fastening)</b> and environmental condition (temperature and ageing). The experimental tests are planned and therefore their results analyzed by means of Design of Experiment techniques. Results show that hybrid joints allow a significant performances enhancement with respect to simple joints when the two simple joining techniques give similar performances, while the performance of hybrid joints are only equal or lower than the those of the strongest joint when the performances of the two joining techniques are significantly different...|$|R

40|$|The {{intermittently}} rivet fastened Rectangular Hollow Flange Channel Beam (RHFCB) {{is a new}} cold-formed {{hollow section}} proposed {{as an alternative to}} welded hollow flange beams. Many experimental and numerical studies have been carried out in the past to investigate the shear behaviour of lipped channel beams. However, no research has been undertaken on the shear behaviour <b>of</b> rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCBs. Therefore experimental and numerical studies were undertaken to investigate the shear behaviour and strength <b>of</b> rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCBs. In this research finite element models <b>of</b> rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCBs were developed to investigate their nonlinear shear behaviour including their buckling characteristics and ultimate shear strength. This paper presents the details of the finite element models <b>of</b> rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCBs and the results. Both finite element analysis and experimental results showed that the current design rules are very conservative for the shear design <b>of</b> rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCBs.

The earlier silk trading business inherited from his father-in-law was dissolved at the same time. The hardware store kept its local character roughly a century before the company expanded its business activity in the 1930s and 1940s to trading fasteners. The local specialized store first developed into a regional, and from the 1950s into a national, company. From the 1960s Bossard began {{to set up and}} expand an international network of bases. In the course of expansion, the company went public on the stock market in 1987. The recession {{at the beginning of the}} 1990s and the associated worsening business trend led Bossard to a review of the entire organization. In doing so the company focused on the core competence <b>of</b> <b>fastening</b> technology and the gradual selling off of all its tools, fittings and handicraft units. Bossard is active in the field <b>of</b> <b>fastening</b> technology in Europe, America and Asia.
