40|$|The {{identification}} of transcriptional differences {{has served as}} an important starting point in understanding the molecular mechanisms behind biological processes and systems. The developmental biology of the inner ear, the biology of hearing {{and of course the}} <b>pathology</b> <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> are all processes that warrant a molecular description if we are to improve human health. To this end, technological innovation has meant that larger scale analysis of gene transcription has been possible {{for a number of years}} now, extending our molecular analysis of genes to beyond those that are currently in vogue for a given system. In this review, some of the contributions gene profiling has made to understanding developmental, pathological and physiological processes in the inner ear are highlighted.

40|$|Deafness {{is often}} {{regarded}} {{as just a}} one and only phenomenon. Accordingly, deaf people are pictured as a unified body of people who share a single problem. From a medical point of view, we find it usual {{to work with a}} classification of deafness in which pathologies attributable to an inner ear disorder are segregated from pathologies attributable to an outer/middle ear disorder. Medical intervention is thus concerned more with the origin, degree, type of loss, onset, and structural <b>pathology</b> <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> than with communicative disability and the implications there may be for the patient (mainly dependency, denial of abnormal hearing behaviour, low self esteem, rejection of the prosthetic help, and the breakdown of social relationships). In this paper, we argue that hearing loss is a very complex phenomenon, which has many and serious consequences for people and involves many factors and issues that should be carefully examined. The immediate consequence of deafness is a breakdown in communication whereby the communicative function needs to be either initiated or restored. In that sense, empowering strategies—aimed at promoting not only a more traditional psychological empowerment but also a community one—should primarily focus on the removal of communication barriers.    Keywords: deafnes...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the long-term development {{of patients with}} a cochlear implant of the University Medical Centre in Utrecht; with regard to three potential predictive factors: severity of preoperative hearing loss, duration <b>of</b> preoperative <b>deafness</b> and cause <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> (the ‘bony disorders’ meningitis and otosclerosis vs. all other causes <b>of</b> <b>deafness).</b> Study design: Retrospective longitudinal clinical study. Predictors of speech perception, after cochlear implantation surgery, included preoperative hearing loss, duration <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> and effect <b>of</b> a bony disorder as cause <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> (meningitis or otosclerosis); with use of Multi-Level Modeling analysis. Patients: 247 adult patients with a cochlear implant. Interventions: Unilateral multichannel cochlear implantation. Main outcome measures: Postoperative speech perception (CVC) scores. Results and conclusion: Perception of CVC words after cochlear implantation is significantly predicted by duration <b>of</b> <b>deafness,</b> preoperative hearing loss and {{presence or absence of}} a bony disorder as cause <b>of</b> <b>deafness.</b> There is no effect of interaction of these prediction variables, nor among themselves nor with the time predictors (=duration of implant use). The development of speech perception over time is best described by a linear and a negative quadratic growth model. As Multi-Level Modeling has been demonstrated in previous studies to be more powerful in hypothesis testing than other analysis tools, our unexpected result <b>of</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> being a significant predictor of speech perception might be due to the sensitivity of the Multi-Level Modeling method...|$|R

METHODS: The authors analyzed National Health Interview Survey data from 1990 and 1991 [...] the years the Hearing Supplement was administered [...] linked with National Death Index data for 1990 - 1995. Adjusting for sociodemographic variables and health status, the authors compared the mortality of three groups of adults ages > or = 19 years: those with prelingual onset <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> (age 3 years), and {{a representative sample of}} the general population. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses adjusted for sociodemographics and stratified by age found that adults with postlingual onset <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> were more likely to die in the given time frames than non-deaf adults. However, when analyses were also adjusted for health status, {{there was no difference between}} adults with postlingual onset <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> and a control group of non-deaf adults. No differences in mortality were found between adults with prelingual onset <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> and non-deaf adults.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{association}} between patterns <b>of</b> pigmentation and <b>deafness</b> {{in the dog}} has a long-documented history, with reports dating back over one hundred years. Long suspected of having a genetic basis, the search for loci with a pronounced influence in the expression of hearing loss in the dog {{has yet to be}} successful. No studies in the dog to date have found a possible influence of a specific colour locus associated with deafness. The present study is intended to evaluate the heritability <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> in the Jack Russell Terrier (JRT), characterize the mode of inheritance, and evaluate the existence of a sex, coat colour, or coat texture influence on the expression <b>of</b> sensorineural <b>deafness.</b> Results The estimation <b>of</b> heritability <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> in the JRT was 0. 22 when deafness was considered a binary (normal/deaf) trait and 0. 31 when deafness was considered a three-category (normal/unilateral/bilateral <b>deafness).</b> The influence <b>of</b> coat colour in the incidence <b>of</b> JRT <b>deafness</b> was statistically significant, indicating that dogs with more white {{are more likely to be}} deaf. The influence of sex or coat texture was not statistically significant in the incidence <b>of</b> JRT <b>deafness.</b> Complex segregation analysis revealed a model of a single locus with a large effect on the binary measure of hearing loss is not supported. Conclusion This is the first attempt, to our knowledge, to characterize a genetic component responsible for deafness in the JRT. The heritability <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> in the JRT was found to be 0. 22 and 0. 31 considering deafness to be a two-category or three-category trait, respectively. There appears to be an influence of coat colour on the expression <b>of</b> <b>deafness.</b> In an attempt to characterize the mode <b>of</b> inheritance <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> in the JRT, a model of a single locus with a large effect on hearing loss is not supported with this data. Further study is needed to determine if a single locus may be influencing deafness in the JRT. While the absence of a clear mode of inheritance complicates genetic dissection <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> in the JRT, the assembling of this pedigree provides a tool for eventually defining the genetic bases of this disorder. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: The hearing {{impairment}} {{has an impact}} on the person’s capabilities and has an influence on the quality of life. In the early childhood the acoustic information is indispensable for development of speech and language. The cochlear implant is a biomedical device that enables the deaf to hear but it cannot help all the hearing impaired individuals. Patients and methods: In the period from March 1996 to August 2004 there were 110 deaf patients who were operated on for cochlear implantation. We evaluated the ethiologic factors <b>of</b> <b>deafness,</b> the age at onset <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> and the benefits of cochlear implant use. Results: Most of the implanted patients were congenitally deaf (60. 91 %). The most frequent cause <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> was hereditary hearing loss (30. 00 %). The period <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> was in majority (52. 72 %) less than five years but a few (10. 00 %) were deaf for more than 15 years. Reimplantation was necessary in four patients. The application and the benefits vary between the individuals but only two gave up the implant all the remainders use it every day. The communication mode in 88 patients is acoustic-oral while in 22 subjects a total method is used. Conclusions: The outcome <b>of</b> management <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> by cochlear implants is comparable to other centers. Good results in congenitally deaf children support the need for universal neonatal hearing screening. </p...|$|R

40|$|Shifra Kisch {{analyses}} {{the social}} consequences <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> and the sociolinguistic context of signing among the Negev Bedouin, the native Arab {{inhabitants of the}} southern arid region of present-day Israel.

The emergence of a local sign language, in several Bedouin groups with exceptionally high rates <b>of</b> <b>deafness,</b> account for significant differences in the experience <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> by both deaf and hearing, exposed to visual language from an early age. Drawing upon ethnographic fieldwork this study introduces the notion of a shared signing community, emphasizing the unique sociolinguistic circumstances where deaf and hearing alike participate in signed communication and share knowledge grounded in daily experiences and practices related to deafness and signing. Despite general neglect and discrimination of the Negev Bedouin, deafness became the target of diverse state services and interventions.

40|$|Bilateral {{cochlear}} implant (CI) users perform poorly on tasks involving interaural time differences (ITD), which {{are critical for}} sound localization and speech reception in noise by normal-hearing listeners. ITD perception with bilateral CI is influenced by age at onset <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> and duration <b>of</b> <b>deafness.</b> We previously showed that ITD coding in the auditory midbrain is degraded in congenitally deaf white cats (DWC) compared to acutely deafened cats (ADC) with normal auditory development (Hancock et al., J. Neurosci, 30 : 14068). To determine {{the relative importance of}} early onset <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> and prolonged duration <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> for abnormal ITD coding in DWC, we recorded from single units in the inferior colliculus of cats deafened as adults 6 months prior to experimentation (long-term deafened cats, LTDC) and compared neural ITD coding between the three deafness models. The incidence of ITD-sensitive neurons was similar in both groups with normal auditory development (LTDC and ADC), but significantly diminished in DWC. In contrast, both groups that experienced prolonged deafness (LTDC and DWC) had broad distributions of best ITDs around the midline, unlike the more focused distributions biased toward contralateral-leading ITDs present in both ADC and normal-hearing animals. The lack of contralateral bias in LTDC and DWC results in reduced sensitivity to changes in ITD within the natural range. The finding that early onset <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> more severely degrades neural ITD coding than prolonged duration <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> argues for the importance of fitting deaf children with sound processors that provide reliable ITD cues at an early age.

Examining the debate on deaf culture and cochlear implants [...] Chapter 3. Reconceptualising deafness as a disability [...] Conclusion. The aim of this thesis is to consider the disabling nature <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> as misrecognition. The nature <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> is not merely confined to the disabled body; instead the degree of the disability is heavily determined by the process of recognition within social interactions. Motivating this thesis is the inherent difficulty in resolving the conflict between Deaf culture and cochlear implants. The debates between interpreting deafness as disability and deafness as difference is problematic; both are too extreme and do not capture the essence <b>of</b> <b>deafness.</b> Asserting deafness as cultural allows for relativism, thus allowing the idea <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> as purely disabled-in-itself as an acceptable idea in ethics. These rather common approaches do not help with the defence of Deaf culture. I argue that the ideal way to defend Deaf culture - the appropriate source of recognition for deaf people and people with hearing loss - is by revising the ‘Deafhood’ model proposed by Paddy Ladd: Asserting a universal conception of Deaf culture - incorporating the normative elements of recognition as argued by Honneth - as a phenomenological requirement for deaf people, not a cultural one. The corollary of this argument is that Deaf culture has a teleological function: to promote the wellbeing of deaf peopleMode of access: World wide web 1 online resource (iv, 69 pages...|$|R
