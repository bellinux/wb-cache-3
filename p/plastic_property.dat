40|$|The {{so-called}} "Local approach" {{is introduced}} to determine ductile fracture {{from the small}} punch test {{by means of a}} micro-mechanical model introduced by Gurson and modified by Needleman and Tvergaard [...] By using the observed load-deflection curve from the small punch test, reverse finite element analysis is performed to determine the material <b>plastic</b> <b>property</b> (?-? curve) and the damage parameters. With material <b>plastic</b> <b>property</b> and the damage parameters known, a compact tensile (CT) specimen can be modeled by a finite element analysis. The J-integral value can be derived from the calculated load-load line displacement curve, and the amount of crack extension can be estimatde by the length of the damaged elements, in which the void fraction reaches the void volume fraction at final fracture. Thus a J-R curve can be created and JIC can be determined according to ASTM E 1820 - 08. Experimental results for both the small punch tests and the standard fracture tests. have been analysed and verifications carried out by using standard uni-axial tensile tests and fracture CT tests.

Furthermore, local anesthetics were investigated regarding their phase interaction with membrane lipids. A new long acting and topically effective local anesthetic/analgesic agent, isopropyl-methyl-[2 -(3 -propoxyphenoxy) -ethyl]-amine (amino diether, AD), was used as the model compound. The nonionized form of AD is liquid oil at room temperature with low water solubility. A submicron o/w emulsion with Newtonian flow property was prepared with AD as the disperse phase. The kinetic stability of this emulsion was increased to prevent Ostwald ripening by addition of small amounts of a hydrophobic excipient to the disperse phase. The emulsion allowed a high in vitro release and permeation rate of AD as well as a sufficient in vivo efficacy. To achieve a <b>plastic</b> <b>property,</b> hydrophilic polymers were added to the o/w emulsion resulting in a significant reduction of the release and permeation rate of AD. In order to avoid the addition of these polymers, a semisolid w/o emulsion was evaluated with AD as the continuous phase. The inherent <b>plastic</b> <b>property</b> of this formulation allows sufficient skin adhesion. Furthermore, the release and permeation rate of AD from this formulation is comparable to that of the Newtonian submicron o/w emulsion. A close correlation between the in vitro permeation studies and the in vivo human plasma profiles was observed using the convolution/deconvolution method. Furthermore, x-ray and calorimetric data indicated that local anesthetics are able to interact with skin lipids both by increasing the chain fluidity of the crystalline lipids and by probably producing phase inversions in the grain borders of the stratum corneum lipid multilayers. It was also shown that this lipid interaction was not directly correlated with the different levels of skin permeation and/or topical efficacy of the investigated compounds...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of certain controlled gradients in plastic properties {{is known to}} promote resistance to the onset of damage at contact surfaces during some tribological applications. Gradients in composition, microstructure and plastic properties can also be deleterious to contact-damage resistance in some situations. In order to realize such potentially beneficial or deleterious effects of <b>plastic</b> <b>property</b> gradients in tribological applications, it is essential first to develop a comprehensive understanding {{of the effects of}} yield strength and strain hardening exponent on frictionless normal indentation. To date, however, systematic studies of plasticity gradient effects on indentation response have not been completed. A comprehensive parametric study of the mechanics of indentation of plastically graded materials is completed in this work by recourse to finite element (FE) computations. On the basis {{of a large number of}} detailed computational simulations, a general methodology for assessing instrumented indentation response of plastically graded materials is formulated so that quantitative interpretations of depth-sensing indentation experiments could be performed. The specific case of linear gradient in yield strength is explored in detail. (cont.) The FE analysis leads to a universal dimensionless function to predict load displacement curves for plastically graded engineering materials. Experimental validation of the analysis is performed by choosing the model system of an electrodeposited nanostructured Ni-W alloy, where the <b>plastic</b> <b>property</b> variation is introduced through a linear variation in grain size with distance through the thickness. The universal dimensionless function is shown to correlate with the shield factor which is used to predict crack behavior at the interface of plastically graded materials. Here in this work a general framework is proposed for the indentation of plastically graded materials based on energetic considerations. Possible mechanisms underlying indentation size effects are also explored including the surface energy terms in the proposed energy based framework so as to rationalize a broad range of experimental observations.

40|$|International audienceImpairments of {{synaptic}} plasticity are {{a hallmark of}} several neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD) which results from the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta leading to abnormal activity within the basal ganglia (BG) network and pathological motor symptoms. Indeed, disrupted plasticity at corticostriatal glutamatergic synapses, the gateway of the BG, is correlated to the onset of PD-related movement disorders and thus has been proposed {{to be a key}} neural substrate regulating information flow and motor function in BG circuits. However, a critical question is whether similar plasticity impairments could occur at other glutamatergic connections within the BG that would also affect the inhibitory influence of the network on the motor thalamus. Here, we show that long-term plasticity at subthalamo-nigral glutamatergic synapses (STN-SNr) sculpting the activity patterns of nigral neurons, the main output of the network, is also affected in experimental parkinsonism. Using whole-cell patch-clamp in acute rat brain slices, we describe a molecular pathway supporting an activity-dependent long-term depression of STN-SNr synapses through an NMDAR-and D 1 / 5 dopamine receptor-mediated endocytosis of synaptic AMPA glutamate receptors. We also show that this <b>plastic</b> <b>property</b> is lost in an experimental rat model of PD but can be restored through the recruitment of dopamine D 1 / 5 receptors.

40|$|Intrinsic excitability is a <b>plastic</b> <b>property</b> {{of cells}} that, along with {{synaptic}} changes, can be modulated by learning. Action potential (AP) height, width, and frequency are intrinsically controlled properties which {{rely on the}} activation of Na+, Ca 2 +, and K+ channels in the dendritic, somatic, and axonal membranes. The fast after-hyperpolarization (fAHP) after an AP is partially responsible for determining the half-width and duration of the AP and thus Ca 2 + influx during the depolarization. In CA 1 hippocampal pyramidal cells, the fAHP is carried by the voltage- and Ca 2 +-dependent BK channel. In addition to modulating {{the duration of the}} AP, the BK-mediated potassium current exerts control over the frequency of AP generation in response to a depolarizing input. These facts position BK-mediated effects to not only modulate immediate intraneuronal communication, but also to control longer-term Ca 2 +-dependent changes in the neuron, such as kinase activation, gene transcription, and synaptic plasticity. We examined how the BK-mediated fAHP was altered in hippocampal neurons after learning trace eyeblink conditioning.

In light of this property of expansive soils, these soils pose problems worldwide that serve as challenge to overcome for the Geotechnical engineers. One of the most important aspects for construction purposes is soil stabilization, which is used widely in foundation and road pavement constructions; this is because such a stabilization regime improves engineering properties of the soil, such as volume stability, strength and durability. In this process, removal or replacing of the problematic soil is done; replacement is done by a better quality material, or the soil is treated with an additive. In the present study, using fly ash obtained from Sesa Sterlite, Jharsuguda, Odisha, stabilization of black cotton soil obtained from Nagpur is attempted.

Micron-sized Ni powder, nano/micron-sized Al powders, and Teflon or epoxy were fabricated as bulk materials by pressing or casting. The thermally initiated reaction response of these materials was evaluated using differential thermal analysis coupled with x-ray diffraction. The analyses showed evidence of thermally initiated reactions between Ni and Al powders, as well as between Ni+Al and Teflon. Nano-sized Al powder showed a preference for reaction with Teflon over Ni, while micron-sized Al reacted strongly with Ni regardless of the presence of a binder. Teflon was shown to be very reactive with the Ni+Al/nano Al mixture, whereas epoxy was not reactive with the metallic powders, and also inhibited reaction between Ni and nano Al. The structural/mechanical behavior of these materials was evaluated using elastic and <b>plastic</b> <b>property</b> measurements via static and dynamic compression tests. Dynamic mechanical testing using reverse Taylor anvil-on-rod impact tests combined with velocity interferometry gave qualitative and quantitative information about the transient deformation and failure response of the composites. The material containing 20 wt% epoxy and nano-sized Al powder showed the most superior mechanical properties in terms of elastic modulus and static and dynamic compressive strength. The addition of Ni and Al powders to the epoxy matrix increased the strength of the composites, and their tendency toward brittle fracture, as evidenced by Ni particle pullout in SEM analysis. The results illustrate that nano-sized Al particles provide significant enhancement to strength of epoxy composites, but at the expense of reactivity. The nano-Al particles get dissociated from the Ni and Al mixture and swept into the epoxy, generating a nano-Al containing epoxy matrix with embedded Ni particles. The chemical reactivity of the system is thus sacrificed as contacts between Ni and Al powders are minimized. A mixture of nano-sized Ni and Al particles may however provide the best combination of high strength and reactivity. M. S.

Therefore, the optimal content of plasticizer in the mixture is 9  wt% (with the amount of 7  wt% modifier), which makes it possible to obtain PMB that by main characteristics is in compliance with the regulation documents for polymer-modified bitumens.|$|R
40|$|Exploitation of {{beneficial}} <b>plastic</b> <b>properties</b> of Tiβ structural {{phase is}} significantly limited at hot forming. Due to this, but also due to structural and mechanical properties, use of titanium alloys is prevalent. There are used particularly alloys with occurrence of (α+β) zone, {{which makes it}} possible to obtain very good resulting structures with high yield value and good <b>plastic</b> <b>properties.</b> Representative of the type of two-phase alloys at hot deformation is Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy, for which we investigated its resistance to deformation and formability. This paper describes manufacture of ultragrain fine titanium, its structure and properties. Strength of ultra-grain fine titanium varies around 651 MPa, grain size around 300 nm...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{presence}} of curing stresses and oriented crystalline structures in the matrix of polymer matrix fiber composites, the in situ nonlinear properties of the matrix are expected to be rather {{different from those of the}} bulk resin. A plane stress micromechanical model was developed to retrieve the in situ elastic-plastic properties of Narmco 5260 and Amoco 8320 matrices from measured elastic-plastic properties of IM 7 / 5260 and IM 7 / 8320 advance composites. In the micromechanical model, the fiber was assumed to be orthotropically elastic and the matrix to be orthotropic in elastic and <b>plastic</b> <b>properties.</b> The results indicate that both in situ elastic and <b>plastic</b> <b>properties</b> of the matrices are orthotropic...|$|R
