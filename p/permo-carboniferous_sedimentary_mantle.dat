40|$|An {{important}} {{issue in the}} numerical simulation of geothermal reservoirs {{is the problem of}} scales. Data are collected at a scale usually smaller than the one used to discretise the sedimentological units in the numerical model. For instance, thermal conductivities sampled from ﬁeld scale cores have measurement support in the order of centimeters to meters, whereas numerical models for heat ﬂow require conductivities representative of scales ranging between tens to hundreds of meters. We present a study aimed at demonstrating the upscaling of thermal conductivities. Based on the spatial characteristics of a large sample data set of thermal conductivities of <b>permo-carboniferous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> rocks, 10 different realizations of the system are randomly generated at a ﬁne scale of resolution and are then upscaled to four different resolutions using diverse averaging procedures (based on arithmetic, geometric, or harmonic averaging) as well as renormalization. Results show that upscaling based on harmonic averaging of local values is superior in reproducing the original values while renormalization gives the poorest results. Generally it is demonstrated that the speciﬁc kind of upscaling has only a small impact on the resulting temperature distribution. Due to the diffusive character of heat conduction all results tend towards the arithmetic mean value associated with the data...|$|R

However, little paleontological data is available from this formation, preventing accurate biostratigraphic and paleoecological interpretations. An abundant, diversified and well preserved assemblage of palynomorphs was recognized from sampling conducted in an outcrop section in Cipol&# 226;ndia District of Aquidauana Municipality, state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. A total of 35 indigenous palynomorph taxa was recognized, comprising 6 species of spores (related to 5 genera), 28 species of pollen grains (14 genera) and 1 species of chlorophycean algae. Monosaccate pollen grains are exceptionally dominant, representing 90. 38 % of the association, particularly constituted by species of the genera Cannanoropollis (30. 41 % of the total assemblage), Potonieisporites (28. 14 %) and Plicatipollenites (19. 52 %). This quantitative overrepresentation is not usual from Gondwana deposits, revealing a particular plant dominance of Cordaitales in the terrestrial flora. These results are interpreted as an upland ecology characterized by plants with a moisture-independent reproduction strategy, under a glacial climate influence.

By lapse of time deposits were transferred into sandstone, siltstone and mudstone that represented the bottom part of rock mass.

During the process of sediment deposition more full-flowing Tigris caused more complicated dynamics of water channels  including meandering and changeability of inter-bedding.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} isotopic {{composition}} (O, D, Sr, OSO 4, SSO 4, Cl, He) of a present saline fluid sample {{collected at the}} sediment/basement interface in the Permian continental formation at 634 m depth in the SE margin of the Massif Central shield (Ardèche margin of the Southeast basin of France). The fluid sample shows clear water-rock interaction processes, such as feldspar dissolution and kaolinite precipitation, which have led to high Na concentrations and water stable isotopes above the local meteoric water line. The geological formations of the SE margin of the Massif Central shield show that intensive fluid circulation phases occurred across the margin from the late Triassic to the middle Jurassic. The fluids most probably originated from fluid expulsion during burial of the thick <b>Permo-Carboniferous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> succession. These circulation phases were responsible for cementation of the margin and for the solutes in the matrix microporosity which were extracted by leaching core samples. The chemical and isotopic composition of the saline fluid sample at 634 m in the Permian rock {{is very similar to}} that of fluids in the microporosity of the rock matrix. Their SSO 4, OSO 4 and Sr isotopic compositions are close to those of cements investigated in fracture fillings in the same geological formations. Simple diffusion computations and comparison of the chemical composition of the present free fluid sample with matrix porosity fluids indicate that the solutes in the present free fluid sample are related to solutes originating from fluid circulation events which occurred 160 - 200 Ma ago through their diffusion from the matrix microporosity. A two-stage fluid flow regime is proposed to interpret the chemistry of present and paleo-fluids. (1) During the extensional context (Permian to Cretaceous), basinal brines migrated along the basement/sediment interface after expulsion from the subsiding basin. This fluid migration would be responsible for the solutes in the rock matrix microporosity and the solutes in the present free fluid sample. (2) Following the Alpine and Pyrenean compressive phases, gravity-driven meteoritic fluids slowly migrated from the surface down to the basement along major faults. This fluid regime would be responsible for the meteoric water collected in the present free fluid sample. Several investigations in Europe have shown that the existence of other saline fluids sampled elsewhere could be explained by these phases of fluid circulation related to specific geodynamic events...|$|R
40|$|In {{southern}} Europe and {{the western}} Mediterranean, Permo-Carboniferous magmatism is well represented in areas of Iberia, the Alps, Sardinia and the Balkan Peninsula. In Iberia, the magmatism that has been related to the Variscan orogeny is associated with syn-orogenic events at ca. 350 - 315 Ma and post-orogenic at ca. 310 - 295 Ma. In the southern Pyrenees there is <b>Permo-Carboniferous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> basins with a significant volume of rhyolitic ignimbrites and andesitic flows. The Erill Castell-Estac, Cadí and Castellar de n’Hug basins are spatially associated with the Boí, Montellá and Vielha granites and the Cardet dacitic dykes emplaced in Variscan basement rocks. U-Pb SHRIMP dating of zircons extracted from these granites, an andesitic flow, a dacitic dyke and six ignimbrites, revealed that magmatism was active from ca. 304 Ma to ca. 266 Ma. The scattering of zircon ages in each sample shows {{that the history of}} melt crystallization was prolonged and complex. The reported ages of the magmatic activity for the Southern Pyrenees in the range ca. 304 - 283 Ma (this study) fit in well with the time interval of magmatism related to the early North-dipping subduction of the Western Paleotethys Ocean, the subsequent development of Iberian orocline (Variscan cycle), and the large-scale bending and blocking of the Paleotethys Ocean subduction at East of Iberia. In paleogeographic reconstructions of the Permo-Carboniferous, Iberia is located in the core of Pangaea to the east of the probable Rheic Ocean suture and near the western end of the subduction zone of the Paleotethys Ocean. The emplacement in Iberia of granites with ca. 310 - 278 Ma age occurred after the collision of Laurussia and Gondwana, when the subduction of the Rheic Ocean was inactive. From a Variscan-cycle perspective, the Permo-Carboniferous magmatism of the Pyrenees has been considered as post-orogenic. However, global paleogeographic reconstructions put Iberia in between the Rheic Ocean suture and the still active subduction zone of the Western Paleotethys Ocean. Therefore, the Permo-Carboniferous magmatism of Iberia, from a Cimmerian-cycle perspective, may have accompanied the closing of the Paleotethys Ocean. During this stage of the evolution of Pangaea, the east of Iberia was geologically affected by the active subduction zone of the Paleotethys Ocean. The period ca. 310 - 285 Ma is marked by the development of an orocline that extends from Iberia to Armorica. The northwards subduction of the western corner of Paleotethys probably caused orocline formation and consequent large-scale bending and blocking of Paleotethys subduction immediately east of Iberia. The Permo-Carboniferous magmatism of Iberia, coeval with this tectonic evolution, shows a mixed imprint of subduction and delamination geochemical signatures. Although this may seem controversial, in our view the magmatic activity preserved in the Southern Pyrenees could provide the missing link between the development of the Iberian orocline and the continued subduction of easternmost segments of the Paleotethys Ocean (Cimmerian cycle) during the evolution of Pangaea...|$|R

Their high Mg/(Mg + total Fe) (0. 55 - 0. 83) and compatible element contents (Ni = 70 - 450 ppm, Cr = 200 - 1800 ppm) indicate equilibration with mantle peridotite, but their low TiO 2 contents (0. 1 - 0. 5 %) indicate severe depletion of this source.

Evidence for both enrichment and depletion of incompatible elements suggests that boninites are derived from refractory peridotite which has been metasomatically enriched in LREE, Zr, Sr, Ba and alkalis. Wide variations in 143 Nd/ 144 Nd (0. 51262 - 0. 51296) are correlated with La/Sm, Sm/Nd and Ti/Zr, which enables identification of components in the boninite source. Possible LREE depleted components have relative REE and Ti abundances like those in depleted peridotites and high 143 Nd/ 144 Nd ratios which reach MORB-like values. Possible LREE enriched components have relative REE abundances {{similar to those in}} metasomatized mantle peridotite nodules, and low 143 Nd/ 144 Nd ratios which indicate either <b>sedimentary</b> sources or <b>mantle</b> sources with recent to ancient LREE enrichment. Relative abundances of Ba and Sr in boninites decrease with increasing LREE enrichment and suggest a non-sedimentary source for the LREE enriched material. Enrichment in Ba, Sr and alkalis may result from a third component derived from subducted oceanic crust. Two models can account for the successive generation of boninites and arc tholeiites within a single area: 1) boninites can be derived from the peridotite residue of earlier arc tholeiite generation which is metasomatically enriched in LREE before boninite volcanism, or 2) arc tholeiites and boninites can be derived from a variably depleted peridotite source which has been pervasively enriched in LREE. Areas of fertile peridotite would yield tholeiites while refractory areas would yield boninites...|$|R
40|$|This {{historical}} perspective provides an overall {{view of the}} main steps {{that led to the}} acceptance of the concept of mantle exhumation accompanying lithosphere stretching and extreme crustal thinning. We first remember that the presence of exposures of mantle rocks along oceanic spreading ridges was early reported in the 60 's due to the results of sediment cores and dredge hauls collected along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. In the meantime, detailed analysis of the relationships between oceanic sediments of Late Jurassic age and their primary basement in the Apennine ophiolites led many authors to point to the importance of exhumation of mantle rocks on ancient seafloors. By contrast to the thick sections of classical ophiolites (e. g. Oman), the Alpine-Corsican-Appennine ophiolites are characterized by a relatively small amount of mafic rocks (gabbros and basalts), by the absence of any sheeted dyke complex and by the frequent occurrence of oceanic sediments stratigraphically overlying mantle-derived peridotites and associated gabbroic intrusions. They display some of the characteristics of slow-spreading ridge systems, but, due to their highly tectonized character, they have been interpreted successively either as remnants of oceanic fracture zones of normal ocean or as remnants of very-poorly organized, abnormal oceanic basement. This review shows how the concept of mantle exhumation has been elaborated more or less in the same period both by marine geoscientists and by geologists conducting investigations in ophiolitic units of the Alps-Apennines mountain belt. Dredging and diving results from the Gorringe Bank, the Iberia margin, the Thyrrenian Sea and the Central Atlantic in the 1980 's and 1990 's provided additional proofs that the mantle is currently exhumed in various oceanic environments, including distal continental margins, back-arc basins and slow-spreading ridges of wide oceans. It is shown finally how renewed cross-information from mountain belts and the oceans, multiplying the examples of <b>sedimentary</b> reworking of <b>mantle</b> material, help better constrain the mechanisms of mantle exhumation. This mechanism progressively appeared as a fundamental step during the processes of extension of both continental and oceanic lithospheres in numerous geological situations worldwide...|$|R

40|$|The {{discovery}} of exhumed continental mantle and hyper-extended crust in present-day magma-poor rifted margins {{is at the}} origin of a paradigm shift within the research field of deep-water rifted margins. It opened new questions about the strain history of rifted margins and the nature and composition of <b>sedimentary,</b> crustal and <b>mantle</b> rocks in rifted margins. Thanks {{to the benefit of}} more than one century of work in the Alps and access to world-class outcrops preserving the primary relationships between sediments and crustal and mantle rocks from the fossil Alpine Tethys margins, it is possible to link the subsidence history and syn-rift sedimentary evolution with the strain distribution observed in the crust and mantle rocks exposed in the distal rifted margins. In this paper, we will focus on the transition from early to late rifting that is associated with considerable crustal thinning and a reorganization of the rift system. Crustal thinning is at the origin of a major change in the style of deformation from high-angle to low-angle normal faulting which controls basin-architecture, sedimentary sources and processes and the nature of basement rocks exhumed along the detachment faults in the distal margin. Stratigraphic and isotopic ages indicate that this major change occurred in late Sinemurian time, involving a shift of the syn-rift sedimentation toward the distal domain associated with a major reorganization of the crustal structure with exhumation of lower and middle crust. These changes may be triggered by mantle processes, as indicated by the infiltration of MOR-type magmas in the lithospheric mantle, and the uplift of the Brianconnais domain. Thinning and exhumation of the crust and lithosphere also resulted in the creation of new paleogeographic domains, the Proto Valais and Liguria-Piemonte domains. These basins show a complex, 3 D temporal and spatial evolution that might have evolved, at least {{in the case of the}} Liguria-Piemonte basin, in the formation of an embryonic oceanic crust. The re-interpretation of the rift evolution and the architecture of the distal rifted margins in the Alps have important implications for the understanding of rifted margins worldwide, but also for the paleogeographic reconstruction of the Alpine domain and its subsequent Alpine compressional overprint...|$|R
40|$|The Principal Cordillera of Central Chile is {{characterized}} by two belts of different ages and lithologies: (i) an eastern Mesozoic belt, consisting of limestone- and gypsum-rich sedimentary rocks at the border between Central Chile and Argentina, where the active volcanic arc occurs; and (ii) a western belt of Cenozoic age containing basaltic to andesitic volcanic and volcanoclastic sequences. This distinctive geological setting controls water chemistry of cold and thermal springs in the region, which are fed by meteoric water that circulates through deep regional structures. In the western sector of Principal Cordillera, water–rock interaction processes produce lowTDS, slightly alkaline HCO 3 − dominatedwaters, although dissolution of underlyingMesozoic evaporitic rocks occasionally causes SO 4 2 − and Cl− enrichments. In this area, few Na+–HCO 3 − and Na+–SO 4 2 − waters occurred, being likely produced by a Ca 2 +–Na+ exchange during water–rock interactions. Differently, the chemical features of Ca 2 +–Cl−waterswas likely related to an albitization–chloritization process affecting basaltic to andesitic rocks outcropping in this area. Addition of Na+–Cl− brines uprising from the eastern sector through the westverging thrust faults cannot be excluded, {{as suggested by the}} occurrence of mantle He (~ 19 %) in dissolved gases. In contrast, in the eastern sector of the study region, mainly characterized by the occurrence of evaporitic sequences and relatively high heat flow,mature Na+–Cl− waters were recognized, the latter being likely related to promising geothermal reservoirs, as supported by the chemical composition of the associated bubbling and fumarolic gases. Their relatively low 3 He/ 4 He ratios (up to 3. 9 Ra) measured in the fumaroles on this area evidenced a significant crustal contamination by radiogenic 4 He. The latter was likely due to (i) degassing from 4 He-rich magma batches residing in the crust, and/or (ii) addition of fluids interacting with sedimentary rocks. This interpretation is consistent with the measured δ 13 C-CO 2 values (from− 13. 2 to− 5. 72 ‰vs. V-PDB) and the CO 2 / 3 He ratios (up to 14. 6 × 1010), which suggest that CO 2 mostly originates from the limestone-rich basement and recycling of subducted sediments,with an important addition of <b>sedimentary</b> (organic-derived) carbon,whereas <b>mantle</b> degassing contributes at a minor extent. According to geothermometric estimations based on the Na+, K+, Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + contents, the mature Na+–Cl− rich waters approached a chemical equilibrium with calcite, dolomite, anhydrite, fluorite, albite, K-feldspar and Ca- andMg-saponites at a broad range of temperatures (up to ~ 300 °C) In the associated gas phase, equilibria of chemical reactions characterized by slowkinetics (e. g. sabatier reaction) suggested significant contributions from hot and oxidizing magmatic gases. This hypothesis is consistent with the δ 13 C-CO 2, Rc/Ra, CO 2 / 3 He values of the fumarolic gases. Accordingly, the isotopic signatures of the fumarolic steam {{is similar to that of}} fluids discharged from the summit craters of the two active volcanoes in the study area (Tupungatito and Planchón–Peteroa). These results encourage the development of further geochemical and geophysical surveys aimed to provide an exhaustive evaluation of the geothermal potential of these volcanic–hydrothermal systems...|$|R
