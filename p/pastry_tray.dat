5000|$|The Promenade was {{refurbished}} in 1990 by Leslie Wright with a gilded {{ceiling and}} reliefs and brass lanterns, and was altered again in 2005 by Thierry Despont, who fitted {{it with an}} oval leather bar; it forms the grand entrance and has a length which is {{equal to that of}} Nelson's Column. Piano music is played throughout much of the day, with live jazz from 19:30. [...] Afternoon tea, a tradition which has taken place at the hotel since its opening in 1931, is served {{every day of the week}} at five in the afternoon in the large Promenade and the Spatisserie, with guests seated in decorative upholstered sofas with low tables placed in front of them. The tables are set with elegant silver cutlery and crockery, with Corinthian columns made of marble, glittering chandeliers, French tapestries and potted plants in the background. Tea is served by waiters dressed in English-style long coats. Hollywood actor Charlton Heston, a frequent guest at the hotel, once commented on the aspect of service at the hotel: “The cooks and bakers, the clerks and porters, the maids and the flower ladies, the bell men are the hotel”.

40|$|Some of {{the most}} {{frustrating}} conflicts are those that people fight within their own heads, as they struggle with the dilemmas and temptations they encounter and create, as has been chronicled ever since Adam was tempted by Eve and Paradise was lost forever. In everyday life, we experience these internal wars when, after resolving to skip the dessert, {{we are faced with}} the <b>pastry</b> <b>tray,</b> or when the tobacco addict, choking with emphysema, battles with himself not to light the next cigarette. Such conflicts are omnipresent as people try to pursue a difficult achievement goal, or follow through on a health regimen (adhering to diets, exercise schedules, medications), or maintain a close relationship-efforts that require more than habit and routine to stay on course as conflict becomes inevitable and the difficulty and frustration of the effort escalates. In this chapter, we consider some of the main findings from psychology that address these internal battles. We do so on the assumption that understanding what makes intrapsychic conflict easier to negotiate constructively is also relevant to the diverse types of conflict that characterize the human condition at every level from the interpersonal to the international. Our primary goal is to capture what psychological research and theory tell us about willpower and to examine the potential implications for conflict resolution...|$|E
