25|$|The Khasansky District lies {{near the}} Sino-North Korean border and the Sino-Russian border and {{included}} two disputed regions along the Tumen River. According to the agreement, 3km² (1mi²) of territory would {{be transferred to}} China, and Chinese ships would gain the right to navigate the Tumen river. The territory transfer would connect a previously enclaved piece of Chinese territory {{to the rest of}} China (Fangchuancun). This portion of the agreement stirred up some controversy among some Russian officials from Primorsky Krai, as they felt that direct Chinese access to the Sea of Japan (through the Tumen River) would decrease the economic importance of Vladivostok and Nakhodka. Other arguments protested at <b>potential</b> <b>pollution</b> from Chinese economic development, the possibility of Chinese military vessels navigating the river, and the presence of a Russian cemetery commemorating the Lake Khasan Incident in the area. Finally, in June 1997, the Russian side proposed a resolution which would divide the disputed territory in half. This was accepted by China in September of the same year, and in November, when the border demarcation work was declared finished, 1.6km² (0.6mi²) were transferred to China, and 1.4km² (0.5mi²) were retained by Russia. The Lake Khasan cemetery remained on the Russian side, and the Chinese officials underwent informal agreements to not build a port along the Tumen River.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Air {{pollution}} issues {{remain as}} the ongoing {{area of concern}} for posing considerable danger to health throughout the world (WHO, 2005). For this reason, air pollution related issues and prevention approaches is an essential area of study more than ever in developing countries like Malaysia. Experimental air <b>pollution</b> <b>potential</b> forecasting study in Klang Valley-Malaysia during January to December 2009 is described and analysed. In this study, the effect of wind speed, rainfall, temperature and stability factor of the lower level of atmosphere on <b>potential</b> of air <b>pollution</b> are evaluated in which Joukoff and Malet (1982) model is used as an initial model. The above meteorological factors first are used to calculate meteorological air <b>pollution</b> <b>potential</b> (MPI). After that, MPIs vs meteorological factors are evaluated utilizing time analysis and linear regression. The results discourage the use of foresaid meteorological factor except for temperature for forecasting of air <b>pollution</b> <b>potential</b> in Malaysia and regions with the same climate characteristics. Finally, a model for forecasting air <b>pollution</b> <b>potential</b> considering temperature as the most effective factor for the application in Malaysia is developed...|$|R

40|$|Agricultural {{nonpoint source}} (NPS) {{pollution}} {{has been the}} most important threat to water environment quality. Understanding the spatial distribution of NPS <b>pollution</b> <b>potential</b> risk is important for taking effective measures to control and reduce NPS pollution. A Transformed-Agricultural Nonpoint <b>Pollution</b> <b>Potential</b> Index (T-APPI) model was constructed for evaluating the national NPS <b>pollution</b> <b>potential</b> risk in this study; it was also combined with remote sensing and geographic information system techniques for evaluation on the large scale and at 1 km(2) spatial resolution. This model considers many factors contributing to the NPS pollution as the original APPI model, summarized as four indicators of the runoff, sediment production, chemical use and the people and animal load. These four indicators were analysed in detail at 1 km(2) spatial resolution throughout China. The T-APPI model distinguished the four indicators into pollution source factors and transport process factors; it also took their relationship into consideration. The studied results showed that T-APPI is a credible and convenient method for NPS <b>pollution</b> <b>potential</b> risk evaluation. The results also indicated that the highest NPS <b>pollution</b> <b>potential</b> risk is distributed in the middle-southern Jiangsu province. Several other regions, including the North China Plain, Chengdu Basin Plain, Jianghan Plain, cultivated lands in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, also showed serious NPS <b>pollution</b> <b>potential.</b> This study can provide a scientific reference for predicting the future NPS pollution risk throughout China and may be helpful for taking reasonable and effective measures for preventing and controlling NPS pollution...|$|R

40|$|Karst terrains, {{such as the}} Lost River Karst Ground-Water Basin, are {{extremely}} vulnerable to ground-water contamination. Seven physical factors: depth to water, recharge, aquifer media, soil media, topography, impact of the vadose zone, and hydraulic conductivity, are evaluated using the DRASTIC system to determine the ground-water <b>pollution</b> <b>potential</b> of the study area. A numerical value is calculated {{for each of the}} seven factors, and a map layer for each factor is produced. These layers are then “added” together to produce a DRASTIC ground-water <b>pollution</b> <b>potential</b> map. The effectiveness of each factor in evaluating the <b>pollution</b> <b>potential</b> of karst terrain is discussed. It was determined that small scale hydrogeologic features unique to karst areas provide significant influences on contaminant transport that are not addressed by the DRASTIC methodology.

50|$|Another key threat {{faced by}} the Great Barrier Reef is {{pollution}} and declining water quality. The rivers of north eastern Australia pollute the Reef during tropical flood events.

Farming practices damage the reef due to overgrazing, increased run-off of agricultural sediments, nutrients and chemicals including fertilisers, herbicides and pesticides representing a major health risk for the coral and biodiversity of the reefs.
