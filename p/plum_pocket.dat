40|$|More than 70 {{years have}} elapsed, since, in 1866, de Bary enunciated the {{hypothesis}} that Lichens are dual organisms, the socalled gonidia being Algae. As about 1899, the year when Nylander died, the dual nature of the Lichens had become generally accepted, lichenologists have had 40 years to realize {{the consequences of this}} theory. Nevertheless even now opinions differ widely. While practically all botanists admit that a Lichen is composed of a Fungus and an Alga, most lichen-taxonomists apply, perhaps for a good deal unintentionally, the species-name to the consortium, while others emphasize the necessity of restricting the specific and generic names to the Fungus. Reinke, Wainio, Zahlbruckner and Keissler may be regarded as adherents of the first procedure; Sernander, Fink, Clements and Nannfeldt of the second. While the attitude of Zahlbruckner c. s. is perhaps largely due to practical considerations, Asahina recently advocates this conception as a logical consequence of the dual nature of Lichens: “Aus der dualistischen Natur der Flechten muss man aber eine Flechten-Art A (Pilz) + B (Alge) als verschieden von der A+B’ betrachten”. But, in my opinion, the very fact of the dual nature of Lichens leads to the conclusion that a Lichen is no more a species than a <b>plum</b> <b>pocket</b> is one. In general, as stated above, {{it seems to me that}} the acknowledgement of the consortium as specific is semiconscious, and rests on practical reasons. Nannfeldt remarks that Werner, for instance, has used specific names as well for the Lichen as for the Fungous component. In many cases, it must be admitted, the procedure though arbitrary, is perfectly harmless. Lichen taxonomy is obliged to use other methods than taxonomic mycology, the vegetative thallus being often as important a feature as the fructification: and with the thallus, one naturally describes the gonidia, though for practical reasons the description remains as a rule incomplete. If the Fungus is strictly monophagous, the presence of a special gonidial partner may be regarded as a character of the Fungus. In many cases, however, especially in groups where the consortium bears a primitive character, difficulties arise. The latter regard not only the delimitation of the species, but their place in the classification as well. There are numerous instances of Fungi living either without or with gonidia, or with different kinds of gonidia. As long ago as 1866, Fries remarked that it would be unnatural to bring Peltigera aphthosa and P. malacea or Pannaria brunnea and P. hypnorum in different genera. The same holds good, for instance, for Peltigera canina and P. variolosa. Reinke argues that the species containing Cyanophyceae and those containing Chlorophyceae might have developped independently, and placed in all these cases the second species in a different genus. But if this procedure is applied, it strikes one that almost or perhaps quite identical species are divided indescriminately over both groups. It appears, for instance, that even the subdivision of Peltigera in Peltidea and Eupeltigera can not be accepted. In such derived groups as Peltigera it happens but rarely that in one species widely different gonidia are met with, and the presence of Algae belonging to the same genus can only be demonstrated by cultivating them. In this connection the forms of Parmelia caperata (Jaag) and of Xanthoria parietina (Waren) must be mentioned. Asahina has suggested that chemical differences in morphologically identical Lichens might be due to physiological differences in the gonidia, but, as Thomas has demonstrated now that parietin, one of the substances which have always been considered as specific for definite consortia, is produced in pure cultures by the Fungi Caloplaca murorum and C. elegans, this hypothesis seems rather doubtful...|$|E

The gall is a chemically induced distortion of the fruits, which are swollen, hollow, curved and greatly elongated, without a seed or stone, but retaining the style. The twigs on infected plants may also be deformed with small strap-shaped leaves.|$|R

He also played in their losing Grand Finals of 1941 and 1943. Plummer kicked just one goal in his career, against Collingwood at Victoria Park. In 1944, his final season, he coached Essendon for seven games with regular coach Dick Reynolds suffering from appendicitis and they won four of them. He continued his coaching career at Brunswick in 1945.|$|R
50|$|Hemlock water {{dropwort}} grows {{well in the}} wetter {{areas and}} is best left alone as the name hemlock suggests. The large leaves of the butterbur (Petasites hybridus) are found in several areas; its name harkens {{back to the days}} before clingfilm or cheap paper when the leaves were used to wrap butter destined for the market. Water ragwort (or Saracen's ragwort) (a species of Senecio) is an introduced plant which grows along the riverside in tall stands. It is common on the Garnock and at present quite rare elsewhere. Himalayan balsam or policemen's helmets is another introduction, but a common one. Giant hogweed is beginning to make its presence felt. It is another plant which should never be handled as the sap can cause severe blistering and scarring of the skin. Ayrshire Rivers Trust are a local conservation charity that have been highly effective controlling invasive weeds in Ayrshire and are soon to tackle Giant Hogweed on the Garnock and other rivers in North Ayrshire. More information on the work of the Trust is available through their website at www.ayrshireriverstrust.org The Stewarton Flower or pink purslane (Claytonia sibirica) is common in wetter areas. It has white or pink flowers at this site, but closer to Stewarton it is almost always white. It seems that it was first introduced as a white variety in the Stewarton area in Victorian times and the common pink variety, introduced later, spread to other areas. Dalgarven, it seems, is {{on the edge of the}} white flower zone of dominance. Dalgarven is the only known site for the <b>Pocket</b> <b>Plum</b> gall Taphrina padi which develops on Bird Cherry.|$|R
