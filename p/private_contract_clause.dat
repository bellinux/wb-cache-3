Congress quickly ratified Roosevelt's action with the Emergency Banking Act. The President soon afterward issued Executive Order 6102, requiring the surrender of all gold coins, gold bullion, and gold certificates to the government by May 1, 1933 in exchange for their value in U.S. dollars at the rate of $20.67 per troy ounce. Congress also passed a joint resolution canceling all gold clauses in public and <b>private</b> <b>contracts,</b> stating such <b>clauses</b> interfered with the power of Congress to regulate U.S. currency.|$|R

In his first week after taking office, Roosevelt closed the nation's banks, acting from fears that gold hoarding and international speculation posed {{a danger to the}} national monetary system. He based his actions on the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917. Congress quickly ratified Roosevelt's action with the Emergency Banking Act. A month later, the President issued Executive Order 6102, confiscating all gold coins, bullion, and certificates, requiring they be surrendered to the government by May 1, 1933 in exchange for currency. Congress also passed a joint resolution cancelling all gold clauses in public and <b>private</b> <b>contracts,</b> stating such <b>clauses</b> interfered with its power to regulate U.S. currency.|$|R

50|$|This game {{provided}} {{the most complex}} transfer processes yet, {{with the ability to}} swap players and give instalments. However, the game limits you to only having four transfers made via <b>contract</b> <b>clauses</b> (i.e. 10% sell on clause or £75,000 to be transferred after fifteen appearances). Using <b>contract</b> <b>clauses,</b> you can usually pick the player up for a cheaper transfer fee than what you would if you didn't use a <b>contract</b> <b>clause,</b> but after you've used all four and try to use another, it will say that the club who the player currently plays for cannot afford to let him go. Once you sell anyone you have used with a <b>contract</b> <b>clause,</b> you may then buy a player using another <b>contract</b> <b>clause.</b>|$|R

As an example, he explores possible explanations for the disparate treatment the Constitution accords to property and contract rights. Despite the Founders 2 ̆ 7 general commitment {{to the preservation of}} <b>private</b> <b>contract</b> and property rights, the <b>contracts</b> <b>clause,</b> by its terms, applies only to state governments, while the just compensation clause applies solely to the federal government. Part I of the Essay summarizes the textual problem posed by the contracts and just compensation clauses. Part II reviews the history of the adoption of those clauses. Part III offers two possible explanations for the reference of each of the two clauses to but one of the two levels of government in our federal system. Part IV concludes the Essay by discussing some implications of these explanations...|$|R

After an initial discussion of the factual and legal background, a historical survey will show the decision employs {{a new approach to}} <b>contract</b> <b>clause</b> analysis. Next, this comment will analyze the Court 2 ̆ 7 s new approach, especially the Court 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of impairments when a state is a contractual party, its willingness to make policy judgments formerly left to legislative discretion, and the decision 2 ̆ 7 s probable effect on any future municipal debt crises. Finally, in accord with Justice Brennan 2 ̆ 7 s dissent in United States Trust, this comment will conclude that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s former approach to <b>contract</b> <b>clause</b> issues was superior because the Court recognized the need for broad state powers to regulate governmental obligations...|$|R

40|$|We study cartel {{contracts}} {{using data}} on 18 <b>contract</b> <b>clauses</b> of 109 legal Finnish manufacturing cartels whose legal status {{is reminiscent of}} e. g. the U.

Cartels use three main approaches to raise profits: Price, market allocation, and specialization. These appear to be substitutes. Choosing one has implications for how cartels deal with instability. Simplifying, we find that cartels economize on <b>contract</b> <b>clauses,</b> cartels in homogenous goods industries allocate markets, and small cartels avoid competition through specialization...|$|R

40|$|During {{the early}} nineteenth century, the <b>contract</b> <b>clause</b> served as the {{fundamental}} source of federally protected rights against the state. Yet the Supreme Court gradually eased many of the restrictions on state power enforced in the <b>contract</b> <b>clause</b> cases while developing the doctrine of substantive due process after the Civil War. By {{the end of the}} nineteenth century, the due process clause had usurped the place of the <b>contract</b> <b>clause</b> as the centerpiece in litigation about individual rights. Most analyses of the history of federally protected rights against the state have emphasized the rise of substantive due process to the exclusion of the diminishing significance of the <b>contract</b> <b>clause.</b> As a consequence, explanations for the evolution of rights against the state generally attempt to account only for the ways in which the late nineteenth century Court expanded upon the constitutional restraints imposed by the Marshall and Taney Courts. A survey of the cases decided under the contract and due process clauses, however, reveals the late nineteenth century Court permitting exercises of state power previously thought to infringe upon constitutional rights, while limiting state power in ways previously thought unacceptable. Even some of the most 2 ̆ 2 conservative 2 ̆ 2 late nineteenth century Justices urged the reversal of the Marshall Court 2 ̆ 7 s most important <b>contract</b> <b>clause</b> precedents, not because the fourteenth amendment rendered them unnecessary, but because they had been wrongly decided. An account for the evolution of federal judicial protection for rights against the state should explain this development as well as the rise of substantive due process. This Article 2 ̆ 7 s thesis is that the development and eventual evisceration of <b>contract</b> <b>clause</b> doctrine can be explained by reference to the process by which the substantive right came to displace the vested right as the central concept in legal thought about rights against the state. The doctrines developed under the <b>contract</b> <b>clause</b> were formed by a decision to protect only those property and contract rights that were conceived to have vested against subsequent legislative interference. That decision, about the sort of property and contract rights that were sufficiently 2 ̆ 2 legal 2 ̆ 2 to be protected by judicial review of legislative power, reflected a consensus among the antebellum legal elite on the justiciability of the vested right. In contrast to that consensus was a disagreement about the justiciability of substantive rights, represented by such antebellum luminaries as Marshall, Story, and Kent, which grew more acute with the gradual recognition of the incoherence of the boundary doctrines developed to determine when an individual property or contract right had vested. One consequence of this gradual disintegration was the recasting of protected property and contract rights as substantive rights against the state...|$|R
