40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{behavior}} of contractors when submitting bids under different institutional arrangements. Construction projects under {{the private and public}} sectors in Hong Kong operate under two distinct contractual and bidding arrangements giving different degrees of risk and uncertainty to the contractors. First, private sector projects in Hong Kong invariably adopt conditions of contracts that shift more risk to the contractor. A typical example is private sector projects do not normally allow fluctuation adjustments, thereby shifting the risks of future increase in prices of construction resources to the contractor. Public sector construction projects include fluctuation clauses for projects of duration over 21 months (Later extended to all contracts via Circular DEVB(PS) 107 / 3 dated 18 July 2008). Second, it is common practice for private sector clients to negotiate with the contractors after they have submitted their bids. Although in some cases, private sector clients may also simply accept the lowest tender, bidders would normally anticipate that they are likely to negotiate with them after the bids are opened. This practice, however, is not allowed in public sector projects. For reasons of public accountability, Government tendering procedures do not allow changes to the bid price after the tenders have been submitted and the time for return lapsed (except for specifically approved cases). This requirement basically bars any price negotiation {{as in the case of}} private projects. We conjecture that these two differences in institutional arrangements have significant impact on bidders’ behavior, which would be characterized by the distribution and pattern of the submitted bid prices. Based on records of bid prices for 105 contracts tendered during the period 1997 and 2007, we found that public sector bids are more skewed to the left (or have a longer tail towards the left) than private sector bids, ceteris paribus. This means that low bids for public sector projects are more scattered than those of private sector projects. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that bidders attempt to hide their true bid prices by submitting higher bids when the client is not bound to accept the lowest tender. The empirical results also suggest that the bid-spread, as defined by the percentage difference between the lowest and second lowest bid, is higher when post tender negotiation is prohibited. Bidders would tend to submit more aggressive bids for public sector projects, knowing that they would not have a second chance to adjust their bid prices at a later stage. This suggests a higher probability of winner’s curse for public sector projects. For private sector projects that do not include fluctuation clauses, the bid-spread is also affected by the expected risk of future increase in the prices of construction resources. When such risk is high, bidders will become more cautious when submitting their bids and thus resulting in a lower bid-spread. The bid distributions for public sector project have thicker tails on both ends compared to those of private sector projects due to its <b>prequalification</b> <b>system</b> and the practice of acceptance of the lowest bid. The empirical evidence in this study confirms this. In addition, market conditions, number of bidders, contract size and the proportion of prime cost and provisional sum as a percentage of the contract sum are also important determining factors of biding behavior. The results of this study show that institutional arrangements matters in determining bidding behavior. Previous studies that attempt to estimate the distribution of bid prices for construction projects have largely ignored the importance of institutional arrangements, which may therefore lead to biased results. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of bidder’s behavior when bidding for construction projects under different institutional arrangements. The understanding will be useful in handling bidding exercises for new construction projects and the advancement of studies on bidding strategy models. published_or_final_versionReal Estate and ConstructionMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|The {{contractor}} prequalification topic has {{had much}} {{written on it}} {{over the last two}} decades. In the past it has been primarily viewed in terms of the appropriate selection of contractors for construction projects. There has been extensive research interest into the functional and process driven aspects of contractor prequalification. However, there has been little research taking a more holistic view of contractor prequalification in terms of the human aspects that surround it. Hence, gaining a wider appreciation on how <b>prequalification</b> <b>systems</b> affect the major stakeholders seems warranted. The use of soft systems thinking allowed for an in-depth and contextual analysis of prequalification issues. This necessitated unstructured in-depth interviews to be carried out with senior industry practitioners. Sifting through their respective experiences allowed for an alternative view of contractor <b>prequalification</b> <b>systems.</b> It allowed a very human perspective of prequalification to emerge. The research suggests that viewing <b>prequalification</b> <b>systems</b> from a human perspective provides a fuller picture of their true benefits and limitations. </p...|$|R

To improve the reliability and objectiveness of decisions being made, prequalification needs to be carried out on a more rational basis.

40|$|Precast and tilt-up {{construction}} methods require temporary props {{to provide}} the necessary structural support to panels during the erection phase. The temporary prop system must be capable of supporting the panel against all loads until the panel has been permanently secured. Traditionally, the design for wind loading on temporary props has been considered through an equivalent static load, including the serviceability condition {{that is based on}} the ultimate wind load divided by a factor of safety. Typical anchorage of the temporary prop includes cast-in ferrules when fixing to the precast panel and post-installed brace fixture inserts in the floor structure. The development of a dynamic test procedure for <b>prequalification</b> of anchor <b>systems</b> for this application requires an accurate review of wind loads expected throughout the intended service life of the temporary prop. This paper considers modelling of the fluctuating propping forces associated with the design wind condition for temporary structures for the purposes of establishing a test loading regime for the prop connections to validate their sufficiency. A spectral based model is considered both directly and indirectly (through time domain simulation via a random phase spectral modelling approach and a rainflow cycle counting technique), to develop such a test loading regime...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} radical change in {{industry}} practice that will {{improve the quality of}} the construction process and the levels of customer satisfaction derived from it by evaluating the quality performance of the contractor. An alternative theory is developed of what constitutes quality, client satisfaction, performance, and their interrelationships {{in the context of the}} construction industry. It should be noted here that the term construction client includes both the owner (i. e. the agency or organization funding the project) and the end-user of the construction (i. e. the general public). A comprehensive view of construction quality is proposed that deals with both the service (as received by the owner) and product (as received by the end-user) aspects of the construction project as well as the corporate quality culture. Such a dissection of construction activity facilitates developing strategies to define, operationalize, measure and improve construction quality. A frame 4 work for the assessment of a contractor's quality performance is established. This involves gathering a list of contractor quality performance (CQP) indicators that are derived from various quality-related practices of the contractor at the corporate and project level. Finally, a contractor quality performance (CQP) evaluation model is introduced that can be used in a contractor <b>prequalification</b> and/or selection <b>system.</b> The CQP indicators are operationalized within the theoretical framework of the CQP evaluation model.
