Design A quasi-experimental study. Participants Thirty-one patients (mean age 69 years, SD 13) with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (mean ejection fraction 23 %, SD 7) who were stable, receiving regular medication and free of acute respiratory illness. Intervention Two manoeuvres were performed – one from long sitting to {{a modified}} (horizontal) <b>postural</b> <b>drainage</b> position, and one from long sitting to a head-down (30 °) <b>postural</b> <b>drainage</b> position. Outcome measures Cardiovascular responses examined were blood pressure, sphygmocardiographic indices, and cardiac rhythm. Respiratory responses examined were respiratory rate, transcutaneous arterial oxyyhaemoglobin saturation, and dyspnoea. Results Three participants were intolerant to the <b>postural</b> <b>drainage</b> positions – two during head-down and one during modified positioning. The remaining 28 participants maintained their resting cardiac rhythm and did not complain of chest pain or dyspnoea. The changes in cardiovascular responses during the sitting to head-down <b>postural</b> <b>drainage</b> manoeuvre in the tolerant participants were significantly greater (p < 0. 05) than the changes during the sitting to the modified <b>postural</b> <b>drainage</b> manoeuvre {{for most of the}} sphygmocardiographic indices.

Conclusion Modified positioning is associated with less cardiovascular stress than head-down positioning, yet for most patients with severe heart disease, both positions are generally well tolerated. For a subset of these patients, either position may be inappropriate. This suggests that modified positioning should be attempted first but that a head-down position may be attempted if the modified position proves ineffective. 9 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Postural</b> <b>drainage</b> is used {{exclusively}} or {{in combination}} with other airway clearance techniques in the management of chronic pulmonary diseases. <b>Postural</b> <b>drainage</b> therapy helps to prevent accumulation of secretions in patients who are at high risk for pulmonary complications. It also helps to remove accumulated secretions from the lungs. The role of body positioning on lung function and the clinical implications of <b>postural</b> <b>drainage</b> has been identified {{in a variety of settings}} including intensive care units. There is dearth in literature on effects on <b>postural</b> <b>drainage</b> on vital parameters. Thus the objective of the study was to measure the vital parameters at different <b>postural</b> <b>drainage</b> positions in healthy asymptomatic adults. Methods: Twenty healthy subjects participated in the study. The instruments used in the current study included a Pulse oximeter, Sphygmomanometer, Stethoscope, <b>Postural</b> <b>drainage</b> table. The outcome measures of interest were heart rate, respiratoryrate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure and Borg’s scale of rate of perceived exertion. The changes in the vital signs were recorded at different head down titling position of 0 °, 15 ° & 30 ° in both supine and prone lying positions Results: Statistical significant difference was found for Systolic Blood Pressure in prone lying at different degrees of tilt (p= 0. 001) and Diastolic Blood Pressure in prone lying (p= 0. 000).

40|$|Introduction: Bronchiectasis is {{a chronic}} {{debilitating}} condition with abnormal permanent dilatation of the airways causing impaired mucus clearance, despite regular chest physiotherapy being mainstay of management for bronchiectasis, {{there is little}} evidence supporting regular chest physiotherapy in bronchiectasis which aims to mobilize secretions and facilitate effective expectoration, providing control of cough and improving airway clearance. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare between the efficacy of 2 techniques of chest physiotherapy ACBT with <b>postural</b> <b>drainage</b> and conventional chest physical therapy as a method of airway clearance in adults with productive bronchiectasis. Methods: The study included 30 subjects, 20 males and 10 females; all having bronchiectasis, the study was carried out on October 6 at the University Hospital. The participating subjects underwent conventional chest physical therapy or ACBT following <b>postural</b> <b>drainage</b> as the airway clearance technique in random order on 14 successive days with twice daily frequency. Results: There was a significant difference regarding mMRC before and after both ACBT and conventional physiotherapy, there was a significant improvement regarding FVC and MMEF after ACBT while there was a significant improvement of FEV 1 and MMEF after conventional physiotherapy. As regards arterial blood gas data comparison, there were significant improvements regarding PaCO 2, PaO 2 and PAO 2 while there was no significant difference as regards P (A-a) O 2 after both types of physiotherapy techniques.

There are several case reports of general anesthesia in these patients, but mainly in the adult population. Here, we report on a 3 -year old female child with KGS, who underwent adenoidectomy because of sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Preoperative preparation consisted of intravenous antibiotics, steroids, as well as <b>postural</b> <b>drainage</b> and inhalations of bromhexine and salbutamol. Anesthesia was induced with propofol, fentanyl and vecuronium and maintained with a continuous infusion of propofol (150 - 200 gkg- 1 min- 1) and supplemental doses of fentanyl. The child was ventilated with oxygen/air mixture (50 %: 50 %) in the pressure-controlled mode of ventilation to keep end-tidal CO 2 between 30 and 35 mmHg. During anesthesia the child’s hemodynamic and respiratory parameters were stable. Extubation, after thorough endotracheal and oral suction, was uneventful.

40|$|Chest {{physiotherapy}} (CPT) is {{one aspect}} of bronchial hygiene and may include turning, <b>postural</b> <b>drainage,</b> chest percussion and vibration, and specialized cough techniques known as directed cough. Any {{or all of these}} techniques may be performed in conjunction with medicinal aerosol therapy (i. e., bronchodilators or mucolytics). The goals of CPT are to move bronchial secretions to the central airways via gravity, external manipulation of the chest, and to eliminate secretions by cough or aspiration with a catheter. Improved mobilization of bronchial secretions contributes to improved ventilation-perfusion matching and the normalization of the functional residual capacity. NOTE: CPT will not be done if IPV is ordered. 1. 1. 1 Turning is the rotation of the body about its long axis. This is usually done in conjunction with procedures designed to aid patient comfort and skin care. However, attention to chest position and deliberate region-specific positioning is usually needed to effect secretion mobilization.
