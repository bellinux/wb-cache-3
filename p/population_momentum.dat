We find that for properly chosen pulse shapes the electron-electron interaction can be effectively and permanently switched from repulsive to attractive {{if there is no}} energy dissipation. The physics behind the interaction conversion is a nonadiabatic shift δ of the <b>population</b> in <b>momentum</b> space. When δ∼π, the shifted population relaxes to a negative-temperature state, which leads to the interaction switching. Due to electron correlation effects δ deviates from the dynamical phase ϕ=∫ dt F(t), which enables the seemingly counterintuitive repulsion-to-attraction transition by a monocycle pulse with ϕ= 0.

This hypothesis has three components: a demographic one based on the negative <b>population</b> growth <b>momentum,</b> i. e., the fact that fewer potential mothers in the future will result in fewer births, a sociological one {{based on the assumption that}} ideal family size for the younger cohorts is declining as a consequence of the lower actual fertility they see in the previous cohorts, and an economic one based on the first part of the Easterlin (1980) relativ...|$|R

40|$|Models of the {{transition}} region-corona-solar wind system are investigated {{in order to find}} the coronal helium abundance and to study the role played by coronal helium in controlling the solar wind proton flux. The thermal force on alpha-particles in {{the transition}} region sets the flow of helium into the corona. The frictional coupling between alpha-particles and protons and/or the electric polarization field determines the proton flux in the solar wind as well as the fate of the coronal helium content. The models are constructed by solving the time-dependent <b>population</b> and <b>momentum</b> equations for all species of hydrogen and helium in an atmosphere with a given temperature profile. Several temperature profiles are considered in order to very the roles of frictional coupling and electric polarization field in the solar wind, and the thermal force in the transition region. Steady-state solutions are found for coronae with a hydrogen flux at 1 AU of 1. 0 x 10 (exp 9) /cm(exp 2) /sec or larger. For coronae with lower hydrogen fluxes, the helium flux into the corona is larger than the flux 'pulled out' by the solar wind protons, and solutions with increasing coronal helium content are found.

The applicability of this technique can be extended also to small diffraction orders and large atom numbers by inducing atomic transparency at the frequency of the probe field, reaching an interferometer phase resolution scaling Δϕ∼ N^- 3 / 4, where N is the atom number.
