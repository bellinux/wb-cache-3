25|$|In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service (NHS) {{began an}} ambitious pay for {{performance}} initiative in 2004, {{known as the}} Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF). General practitioners agreed to increases in existing income according to performance with respect to 146 quality indicators covering clinical care for 10 chronic diseases, organization of care, and <b>patient</b> <b>experience.</b> Unlike proposed quality incentive programs in the United States, funding for primary care was increased 20% over previous levels. This allowed practices to invest in extra staff and technology; 90% of general practitioners use the NHS Electronic Prescription Service, and up to 50% use electronic health records {{for the majority of}} clinical care. Early analysis showed that substantially increasing physicians' pay based on their success in meeting quality performance measures is successful. The 8,000 family practitioners included in the study earned an average of $40,000 more by collecting nearly 97% of the points available.|$|E

Design: Secondary analysis of data from a widely used survey on <b>patient</b> <b>experiences</b> of Dutch inpatient hospital care [Consumer Quality Index (CQI) Inpatient Hospital Care]. Setting: Inpatient hospital care <b>experience</b> survey of <b>patients</b> of 78 Dutch hospitals. Participants: A total of 15 171 randomly selected inpatients from 78 Dutch hospitals, who had at least one night of hospitalization between October 2006 and October 2007. Main outcome measures: Explained variance in <b>patient</b> <b>experiences</b> at the department level, compared with the explained variance at the hospital level. Significant differences in <b>patient</b> <b>experiences</b> between types of departments, expressed in regression coefficients. <b>Patient</b> <b>experiences</b> were measured using validated quality indicators, calculated from specific survey items. Results: Adding the department level to the analyses of <b>patient</b> <b>experiences</b> is statistically worthwhile for a number of quality indicators of the CQI Inpatient Hospital Care, and will enable the presentation of more detailed results within hospitals. Furthermore, the results indicated that there are some systematic differences in <b>patient</b> <b>experiences</b> between specific types of hospital departments across hospitals. However, the proportion of variance in experiences explained by both department and hospital is limited (max. 14 %). Conclusions: Analyses of quality information on <b>patient</b> <b>experiences</b> of inpatient hospital care should not only take the hospital level, but also at the more specific department level into account.

The main focus of this research was to comprehend the views of Dutch nurses on how their work and their work environment contribute to positive <b>patient</b> <b>experiences.</b> Methods A descriptive qualitative research design was used to collect data. Four focus groups were conducted, one each with 6 or 7 registered nurses in mental health care, hospital care, home care and nursing home care. A total of 26 nurses were recruited through purposeful sampling. The interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. Results The nurses mentioned essential elements that they believe would improve <b>patient</b> <b>experiences</b> of the quality of nursing care: clinically competent nurses, collaborative working relationships, autonomous nursing practice, adequate staffing, control over nursing practice, managerial support and patient-centred culture. They also mentioned several inhibiting factors, such as cost-effectiveness policy and transparency goals for external accountability. Nurses feel pressured to increase productivity and report a high administrative workload. They stated that these factors will not improve <b>patient</b> <b>experiences</b> of the quality of nursing care. Conclusions According to participants, a diverse range of elements affect <b>patient</b> <b>experiences</b> of the quality of nursing care. They believe that incorporating these elements into daily nursing practice would result in more positive <b>patient</b> <b>experiences.</b> However, nurses work in a healthcare context in which they have to reconcile cost-efficiency and accountability with their desire to provide nursing care that is based on patient needs and preferences, and they experience a conflict between these two approaches.
