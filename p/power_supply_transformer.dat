50|$|Some {{incandescent}} or LED-based strings use a <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>transformer</b> with lamps {{connected in}} parallel. These sets are much safer, {{but there is}} a voltage drop {{at the end of the}} string causing reduced brightness of the lamps at the end of the set. The reduced brightness is, however, less noticeable with LED-based sets than incandescent sets. Power supplies with integrated plugs may make the set difficult to connect in certain places.|$|E
50|$|Heaters {{require a}} low voltage, high current source of power. Miniature {{receiving}} tubes for line-operated equipment {{use on the}} order of 0.5 to 4 watts for heater power; high power tubes such as rectifiers or output tubes use {{on the order of}} 10 to 20 watts, and broadcast transmitter tubes might need a kilowatt or more to heat the cathode. The voltage required is usually 5 or 6 volts AC. This is supplied by a separate 'heater winding' on the device's <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>transformer</b> that also supplies the higher voltages required by the tubes' plates and other electrodes. One approach used in transformerless line-operated radio and television receivers such as the All American Five is to connect all the tube heaters in series across the supply line. Since all the heaters are rated at the same current, they would share voltage according to their heater ratings.|$|E

50|$|The cycle {{can then}} be repeated. If the {{secondary}} current is allowed to discharge completely to zero (no energy stored in the core), then {{it is said that}} the transformer works in discontinuous mode (DCM). When some energy is always stored in the core (and the current waveforms look trapezoidal rather than triangular), then this is continuous mode (CCM). This terminology is used especially in <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>transformers.</b>|$|R
50|$|When the {{capacitor}} {{is connected}} {{directly to the}} bridge, as shown, current flows in {{only a small portion}} of each cycle, which may be undesirable. The transformer and bridge diodes must be sized to withstand the current surge that occurs when the power is turned on at the peak of the AC voltage and the capacitor is fully discharged. Sometimes a small series resistor is included before the capacitor to limit this current, though in most applications the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>transformer's</b> resistance is already sufficient. Adding a resistor, or better yet, an inductor, between the bridge and capacitor can ensure that current is drawn over a large portion of each cycle and a large current surge does not occur.|$|R

This system mainly {{consists of four}} parts: a process chamber, a pumping system, a gauge system, and a heating system. Two graphite electrodes are installed {{in the middle of}} the process chamber. A graphite boat spanning across the two electrodes is used as a resistive heater. The DC current applied to the graphite boat is converted by a <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>transformer.</b> A K-type thermocouple in contact with the boat is employed to control the working temperature. The conjunctional circuits of the power supply, thermocouple, and cooling water are arranged below outside the process chamber. A movable shutter is utilized to control evaporation time. The pumping system including a rotary vane pump and a turbo pump is able to evacuate the process chamber down to a pressure lower than 1 × 10 − 6 torr. The top of the process chamber is a liftable cap with a hollow cavity inside. Liquid nitrogen can be poured into and fill the cavity for rapid uniform cooling of the n-type (100) silicon substrates. The substrates were repeatedly ultrasonically rinsed in acetone followed by dry purge of N 2 gas before use. They were then adhered to the underside of the cap for growth of Gaq 3 nanostructures. A stainless steel ring was put on the graphite boat, and commercial Gaq 3 powder was placed into the ring. The distance between the graphite boat and the substrate was fixed at 10 cm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract − Power {{distribution}} {{lines are}} {{a major source of}} interference in ECG recordings obtained with surface electrodes. Displacement currents coupled to electrodes, their leads and directly into the body, and stray capacitance in <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>transformers,</b> result into differential-mode, common-mode and isolation-mode interference. Shielding electrode leads reduces displacement currents coupled to them. Amplifiers with high common-mode and isolationmode rejection ratio reduce common-mode and isolationmode interference, but interference coupled in differential mode cannot be reduced by shielding neither by amplifier design. We propose the use of a grounded electrode close to each recording electrode instead of the customary “rightleg” ground electrode, to reduce differential-mode interference. We provide a qualitative model to explain that interference reduction, and experimental evidence to show its effectiveness even for non-isolated recording systems in the presence of strong power-line interference...|$|R
