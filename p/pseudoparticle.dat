50|$|When {{long-range}} forces (typically gravity or the Coulomb force) {{are taken}} into account, then the interaction between each pair of particles needs to be computed. Both the number of interactions and cost of computation increase quadratically {{with the number of}} particles. This is not acceptable for simulations with large number of particles. A possible way to avoid this problem is to combine some particles, which are far away from the particle under consideration, into one <b>pseudoparticle.</b> Consider as an example the interaction between a star and a distant galaxy: The error arising from combining all the stars in the distant galaxy into one point mass is negligible. So-called tree algorithms are used to decide which particles can be combined into one <b>pseudoparticle.</b> These algorithms arrange all particles in a tree, a quadtree in the two-dimensional case and an octree in the three-dimensional case.|$|E

50|$|The {{stability}} of these pseudoclassical configurations can be investigated by expanding the Lagrangian defining the theory around the <b>pseudoparticle</b> configuration and then investigating {{the equation of}} small fluctuations around it. For all versions of quartic potentials (double-well, inverted double-well) and periodic (Mathieu) potentials these equations were discovered to be Lamé equations, see Lamé functions.

50|$|Mathematically, a Yang-Mills instanton is a self-dual or anti-self-dual {{connection}} in a principal bundle over a four-dimensional Riemannian manifold that {{plays the role}} of physical space-time in non-abelian gauge theory. Instantons are topologically nontrivial solutions of Yang-Mills equations that absolutely minimize the energy functional within their topological type. The first such solutions were discovered in the case of four-dimensional Euclidean space compactified to the four-dimensional sphere, and turned out to be localized in space-time, prompting the names <b>pseudoparticle</b> and instanton.|$|E
50|$|As stated above, the instanton is the <b>pseudoparticle</b> {{configuration}} defined on {{an infinite}} line of Euclidean time that communicates {{between the two}} wells of the potential and {{is responsible for the}} ground state of the system. The configurations correspondingly responsible for higher, i.e. excited, states are periodic instantons defined on a circle of Euclidean time which in explicit form are expressed in terms of Jacobian elliptic functions (the generalization of trigonometric functions). The evaluation of the path integral in these cases involves correspondingly elliptic integrals. The equation of small fluctuations about these periodic instantons is a Lamé equation whose solutions are Lamé functions. In cases of instability (as for the inverted double-well potential) this equation possesses negative eigenvalues indicative of this instability, i.e. decay (as shown in the paper of Liang, Müller-Kirsten and Tchrakian referred to above).|$|E

40|$|Transmissible {{gastroenteritis}} virus (TGEV), an enteric coronavirus of swine, is {{a potent}} inducer of alpha interferon (IFN-α) both in vivo and in vitro. Incubation of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} with noninfectious viral material such as inactivated virions or fixed, infected cells leads to early and strong IFN-α synthesis. Previous studies have shown that antibodies against the virus membrane glycoprotein M blocked the IFN induction and that two viruses with a mutated protein exhibited a decreased interferogenic activity, thus arguing for a direct involvement of M protein in this phenomenon. In this study, the IFN-α-inducing activity of recombinant M protein expressed in the absence or presence of other TGEV structural proteins was examined. Fixed cells coexpressing M together with at least the minor structural protein E were found to induce IFN-α almost as efficiently as TGEV-infected cells. <b>Pseudoparticles</b> resembling authentic virions were released in the culture medium of cells coexpressing M and E proteins. The interferogenic activity of purified <b>pseudoparticles</b> was shown to be comparable to that of TGEV virions, thus establishing that neither ribonucleoprotein nor spikes are required for IFN induction. The replacement of the externally exposed, N-terminal domain of M with that of bovine coronavirus (BCV) led to the production of chimeric particles with no major change in interferogenicity, although the structures of the TGEV and BCV ectodomains markedly differ. Moreover, BCV <b>pseudoparticles</b> also exhibited interferogenic activity.
