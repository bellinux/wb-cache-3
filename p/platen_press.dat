He took odd jobs: as a warehouse clerk in San Leandro; as a taxi driver for Berkeley's Taxi Unlimited, a worker's cooperative; as a laborer for several furniture movers; and he trained as letterpress printer under Clifford Burke at Cranium Press in San Francisco. Matson acquired a hand-lever letterpress from Harold Adler, {{following in the footsteps}} of his grandfather, and then a foot-treadle 8x12 <b>platen</b> <b>press</b> from Irving Rosenthal's Free Press in San Francisco. Besides business cards, broadsides and issue number four of the Berkeley Poets' Cooperative, he printed and bound his own book Heroin and John Ceely's The Country is Not Frightening as publisher Neon Sun. He found that the demands of small-press publishing undercut his energy to write, so he let that enterprise dissolve and kept job printing as a part-time endeavor. He produced fine business cards, broadsides, announcements, and a number of chapbooks for Paul Mariah of ManRoot Press in the 1980's and early 1990's ...|$|E

Despite dominating the industry in the 1930s, by the 1950s the offset printing industry had eclipsed the world of movable type printing, and only Chandler & Price and Brandtjen and Kluge continued to make open <b>platen</b> (Gordon) <b>presses.</b> Chandler & Price ceased production of presses in 1964.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to Colt firearms, the factory produced {{a number of}} items under contract for other companies. The most famous of these was a letterpress printing press designed by Merrit Gally, known as the Universal. From 1873 to 1902, the Armory manufactured a series of these presses that developed a reputation as the finest hand-fed <b>platen</b> <b>press</b> ever made (a reputation which survives to the present). These presses eventually became known generically as [...] "Colt's Armory" [...] presses, although they were distributed under names including Colt's Armory, Universal, Victoria, Hartford, National and Laureate. The fascinating history of the design, production, sales and business battles behind these storied presses was summarized in a 1983 article in the typographic journal Type & Press.|$|E

40|$|The {{processes}} and techniques used to fabricate plate-fin sandwich actively cooled panels are presented. The materials were 6061 aluminum alloy and brazing sheet having clad brazing alloy. The panels consisted of small scale specimens, fatigue specimens, {{and a large}} 0. 61 m by 1. 22 m test panel. All panels were fluxless brazed in retorts in heated <b>platen</b> <b>presses</b> while exerting external pressure to assure intimate contact of details. Distortion and damage normally associated with that heat treatment were minimized by heat treating without fixtures and solution quenching in an organic polymer solution. The test panel is the largest fluxless brazed and heat treated panel of its configuration known to exist...|$|R
50|$|The major {{advantage}} {{of this process is}} that it can form large and complex workpieces in one operation. The finished product has excellent precision and a fine surface finish. It also does not suffer from springback or residual stresses. Products can also be made larger to eliminate assemblies or reduce weight, which is critical in aerospace applications. Lower strength required and less tooling costs. McDonnell Douglas utilized SPF design and production technology into the F-15 in the 1980s.

The B-staged laminates were subjected to storage for various periods of time {{up to six months}} at ambient shop conditions and high humidity prior to fabrication into {{structural elements}} to determine the processability of the graphite/polyimide after exposure to these conditions. Changes in processability were monitored by measuring flexure and interlaminar shear strengths, glass transition temperature, moisture content, and formability of the B-staged laminates. No significant change in the processability of either Celion 6000 /PMR or Celion 6000 /LaRC- 160 was recorded indicating that after B-staging the graphite/polyimide laminates can be stored for extended periods of time in normal shop and high humidity environments and then be fabricated into defect-free structural elements in heated <b>platen</b> <b>presses...</b>|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} {{thermoplastic}} composites (TPC) {{increased significantly}} because of their low cost, fast processing cycles and recyclability. In an effort to provide a manufacturing technique well suited for large TPC parts, Delft University of Technology has developed an infusion process based on a reactive anionic polyamide- 6 (APA- 6) resin system. Following recent work where significant differences in mechanical and physical laminates property with respect to flow direction were identified, the work presented in this thesis aims at improving laminate uniformity by testing different heating set-ups and infusion strategies. First, the fibre coupling agent, contained in the proprietary 8225 finish, was tested to asses its compatibility with APA- 6. Results show that this fibre coupling agent {{is compatible with the}} APA- 6 matrix system, but is not better or worse that the previous 8207 finish used in previous work done at TU Delft. Through a second study, key laminate properties were evaluated (ILSS, crystallinity and degree of conversion) using two different heating set-ups (<b>platen</b> <b>press</b> and infrared panels) over three different curing temperatures (160 - 180 ℃). The results of this study identified that the infrared method yielded better laminates than the <b>platen</b> <b>press</b> set-up. However, most laminate produced still had non-uniform properties with respect to flow direction, but laminates cured at 180 ℃ showed better average properties. Based on these results, to improve property uniformity, a third study was conducted using the double infusion strategy: a low infusion temperatures (110 - 150 ℃) followed by a curing step performed at 180 ℃. The results showed that the best laminate uniformity could be achieved with this double infusion strategy at infusion temperatures between 110 ℃ and 130 ℃. The Tm and ILSS of these laminates exhibited lower standard deviation when compared to the one infused at 150 ℃ and the one polymerised with a non-isothermal strategy. This uniformity enhancement was also validated with comparative laminate C-scans and optical microscopy results...|$|E
40|$|For {{the first}} time, {{internally}} reinforced aggregate polymer ceramic composites were evaluated against fragment simulating projectiles (FSPs) of various calibers to investigate their ballistic impact response. Samples were prepared by mechanically mixing B 4 C and cBN over {{a range of}} ratios and combinations with either thermosetting phenolic or epoxy resin and aramid pulp. Dry mixtures were then molded in a closed die using a heated <b>platen</b> <b>press.</b> The resulting tiles were then mounted as ‘‘strike faces’’ to an aramid backing material using an epoxy resin. Backed targets were tested in a fully instrumented firing range against 5. 56 mm FSPs to test ballistic limit. A further series of tests using 7. 62, 12. 5, and 20 mm FSPs was conducted to examine round deformation {{across a range of}} fragments calibers. Round deformations were measured after impact and plotted against shot velocity. It was found that the polymer ceramic composite materials were effective round deformers and, like sintered ceramic strike faces, demonstrated improved ballistic performance at an equivalent areal density and impressive multihit capability...|$|E
