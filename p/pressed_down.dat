5|$|Unlike Hartnell's grave, {{the grave}} of Private William Braine was largely intact. When he was exhumed, the survey team saw signs that his burial had been hasty. His arms, body, and head had not been {{positioned}} carefully in the coffin, {{and one of his}} undershirts had been put on backwards. The coffin seemed too small for him; its lid had <b>pressed</b> <b>down</b> on his nose. A large copper plaque with his name and other personal data punched into it adorned his coffin lid.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{he could}} walk, Braille spent time playing in his father's workshop. At the age of three, the child was playing with some of the tools, trying to make holes in a piece of leather with an awl. Squinting closely at the surface, he <b>pressed</b> <b>down</b> hard to drive the point in, and the awl glanced across the tough leather and struck him in one of his eyes. A local {{physician}} bound and patched the affected eye and even arranged for Braille to be met the next day in Paris by a surgeon, but no treatment could save the damaged organ. In agony, the young boy suffered for weeks as the wound became severely infected; an infection which then spread to his other eye, likely due to sympathetic ophthalmia.|$|E
5|$|Over twenty skulls {{have been}} found from this dinosaur. As with other lambeosaurines, the animal bore a tall, {{elaborate}} bony crest atop its skull, which contained the elongate narial passages. The narial passages extended into the crest, first into separate pockets in the sides, then into a single central chamber and onward into the respiratory system. The skull of the type specimen has no dermal impressions on it. During preservation it was compressed laterally, so now the width is about two-thirds {{what it would have}} been in real life. According to Brown, the compression also caused the nasals to shift where they <b>pressed</b> <b>down</b> on the premaxillaries. Because they were pressed on the premaxillaries, the nasals would have closed the nares. Apart from the compression, the skull appears to be normal. Contrary to what Brown assumed, the areas concerned were fully part of the praemaxillae.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} model Famicom featured two game controllers, both {{of which}} were hardwired {{to the back of the}} console. The second controller lacked the START and SELECT buttons, but featured a small microphone. Relatively few games made use of this feature. The earliest produced Famicom units initially had square A and B buttons. This was changed to the circular designs because of the square buttons being caught in the controller casing when <b>pressed</b> <b>down</b> and glitches within the hardware causing the system to freeze occasionally while playing a game.|$|E
25|$|Swimming {{butterfly}} {{is difficult}} if the core is not utilized, and correct timing and body movement makes swimming butterfly much easier. The body moves in a wave-like fashion, {{controlled by the}} core, and as the chest is <b>pressed</b> <b>down,</b> the hips go up, and the posterior breaks the water surface and transfers into a fluid kick. During the push phase, the chest goes up and the hips are at their lowest position. In this style, the second pulse in the cycle is stronger than the first pulse, as the second pulse is more in flow with the body movement.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{meals in}} India were eaten while seated {{either on the}} floor or on very low stools or cushions. Food is most often eaten with the right hand rather than cutlery. The left hand is used to serve oneself when the courses are not served by the host. Often roti is used to scoop curry without {{allowing}} it to touch the hand. In the wheat-producing north, a piece of roti is gripped with the thumb and middle finger and ripped off while holding the roti down with the index finger. A somewhat different method {{is used in the}} south for the dosai, the adai, and the uththappam, where the middle finger is <b>pressed</b> <b>down</b> to hold the crepe down and the forefinger and thumb used to grip and separate a small part. Traditional serving styles vary regionally throughout India.|$|E

25|$|On {{the first}} play of the second quarter, Chris Brown ran into the endzone for a Sooner touchdown. Garrett Hartley punched in the extra point to make it 7–3, Oklahoma. Missouri then put {{together}} a 14play drive, but failed to score a touchdown. They had the ball, first and goal, at the Oklahoma 9. Daniel chose to keep the ball and ran it up the middle for an apparent score. However, the officials ruled that when his knee touched the ground, the ball had not broken {{the plane of the}} goal line, and the ball was spotted at the 1yard line. The Sooners' defense then kept the Tigers out of the endzone, ultimately forcing another Wolfert field goal. The score at this point was 7–6, Oklahoma. The Sooners got the ball but could not do anything with it, punting it away from the 50-yard line. Missouri promptly threw three incomplete passes and punted it back to Oklahoma, where it went out of bounds at the 50. Oklahoma passed its way into the redzone on this drive, and then rushed their way into the endzone, ending with a 2yard play by Chris Brown for the score. Hartley's extra point was good, making the score 14–6, Oklahoma. With 3:06 left in the half, Mizzou <b>pressed</b> <b>down</b> the field, aided by a pass to Martin Rucker for 13yards, to which an Oklahoma 15yard facemask penalty was added. The Tigers ended up on the Oklahoma 4yard line, where Missouri set up for the pass, spreading the Sooners' defense out. This let Chase Daniel easily jog across the goal line for a touchdown. Interestingly, the Tigers decided to go for a two-point conversion and the tie, rather than attempt the almost sure kick and trail by one at the half. The play was a double reverse; Jeremy Maclin ended up with the ball and passed it to Martin Rucker, who was wide open in the endzone. Oklahoma got the ball back with 5 seconds on the clock and took a knee, ending the first half with a score of 14–14.|$|E
25|$|Other {{variations}} of the standard minifigure produced for Star Wars sets included the light-up light-saber (L.U.L.S.) minifigures. These figures were released {{as a part of}} the more expensive Star Wars Episode III sets in 2005. These figures look like standard minifigures, but to facilitate internal electronics, their parts cannot be removed; the only exception to this is the headgear, the left hand and arm, and each of the legs from the hips. When the head is <b>pressed</b> <b>down,</b> an LED illuminates the light-saber blade. These figures rely on battery power for their special feature. The batteries last three hours and are not intended to be replaced, although replacement is possible. Many fans, especially children, were amenable to this innovation. Others however, particularly adult collectors, found these figures contentious, considering them to be an unwelcome gimmick. The fact that in two cases unique characters were produced solely as L.U.L. minifigs, with no standard version available to collectors, was also an unpopular decision. Following the initial release of these figures Lego announced no more were to be produced, due to their unpopularity and more expensive production. One set, the 7261 Clone Turbo Tank, which featured an L.U.L. version of Jedi Knight Mace Windu, was even reissued with a standard version of the minifig and an extra Clone Trooper figure to make up the cost of the set. There was also at least one high end City themed set (a Police Station/HQ) that included a police officer with a light up 'torch'. Another L.U.L.S. minfig in police uniform appeared without the 'saber' part of the light saber and a yellow LED in the 'handle' of the light saber, reusing the L.U.L.S. design outside the Star-wars setting as an effective 'torch'. He appeared in a high end City set based on a standard and well selling City Police HQ design. A complaint about the set was that the L.U.L.S. minifig was contained in a 'try me' compartment of the box allowing customers (and excited children) to wear down his battery while he was still on the shelf. The set was discontinued after a year with a separate identical design but with 3 extra normal minifgs replacing the L.U.L.S. minfig.|$|E

500|$|The cap is rounded to convex before {{flattening}} with age, and attains {{a diameter}} of [...] Its margin is curved inward when young, and usually has hanging remnants of the partial veil. The surface is dry and initially coated with fine particles, while later it develops fine hairs or small scales that are <b>pressed</b> <b>down</b> flat on the surface; in maturity the surface usually develops fine cracks or wrinkles. It is bright yellow, later turning to orange-red to brownish red. The flesh is white to pale yellow, and, when cut, will slowly stain pale blue, then dingy yellow to pale brown. Its flesh has been described variously as indistinct, or bitter tasting with an odor of hickory leaves. The pore surface is bright yellow before turning dingy yellow to grayish brown with age. It stains greenish blue then grayish brown after being bruised or injured. The pores, which number about 1–3 per millimeter, are angular to almost circular. The tubes comprising the pore surface are [...] deep. The yellow stem measures [...] long by [...] thick, and is roughly equal in width throughout or somewhat thicker near the base. It is solid (i.e., not hollow), and, above {{the level of the}} base, the surface is covered with minute hairs pressed flat against the surface. The partial veil, also bright yellow, is cottony and powdery, and remains as a ring on the upper portion of the stem, although in some specimens it merges gradually with the stipe surface and becomes inconspicuous. There is white mycelium at the stipe base.|$|E
500|$|Black tea: The {{tea leaves}} {{are allowed to}} {{completely}} oxidize. Black tea is first withered to induce protein breakdown and reduce water content (68-77% of original). The leaves then undergo a process known in the industry as [...] "disruption" [...] or [...] "leaf maceration", which through bruising or cutting disrupts leaf cell structures, releasing the leaf juices and enzymes that activate oxidation. The oxidation process takes between 45–90 minutes to 3 hours and is done at high humidity between 20-30 degrees Celsius, transforming much of the catechins of the leaves into complex tannin. Orthodox processed black teas are further graded according to the post-production leaf quality by the Orange Pekoe system, while crush, tear, curl (CTC) teas use a different grading system. Orthodox tea leaves are heavily rolled either by hand or mechanically on a cylindrical rolling table or a rotorvane. The rolling table consists of a ridged table-top moving in an eccentric manner to a large hopper of tea leaves, of which the leaves are <b>pressed</b> <b>down</b> onto the table-top. The process produces a mixture of whole and broken leaves, and particles which are then sorted, oxidized, and dried. The rotovane consisted of an auger pushing withered tea leaves through a vane cylinder [...] which crushes and evenly cuts the leaves. Crush, tear, curl is a production method developed by William McKercher in 1930 which uses machines with contra-rotating rotors with surfaces patterning that cut and tear the leaves producing a product popular for use in tea bags. The rotovane to often use to precut the withered tea prior to the CTC and to create broken orthodox processed black tea.|$|E

500|$|The {{shape of}} the cap of B.rubroflammeus is convex to broadly convex, and reaches a {{diameter}} of [...] The margin of the cap extends slightly beyond the tubes. The cap surface is dry and initially appears appressed-fibrillose (with fibrils <b>pressed</b> <b>down</b> flat against the surface) or has a matted grayish tomentum, but later the hairs slough off and the matted tomentum is present only along the cap margin. In maturity, {{the center of the}} caps develop slight cracks. The cap is a deep vinaceous-red color that remains constant throughout the life of the fruit bodies. The flesh is thick, soft, and yellow. Its taste is mild, and it has no distinct odor. On the underside of the cap, the spore-bearing surface comprises vertically arranged minute tubes with pore-like openings. The tubes are yellow, [...] deep, initially adnate (fused) to the stem, but later becoming free from attachment (or nearly so). Individual pores are round and small (about 2 per mm), while the overall pore surface is uneven or pitted. Its color is initially deep red, but fades slightly in maturity; the pore surface quickly turns blue with injury. The stem is [...] long, [...] thick, solid (i.e., not hollow), and equal in width throughout to club-shaped. Inside, it is yellowish with reddish streaks. Most of the stem surface is covered with coarse dark red reticulations, although near the top the color is yellow beneath the reticulations. All parts of the mushroom will quickly stain blue when cut, bruised, or otherwise injured. The mushroom is poisonous, and if consumed can cause gastrointestinal distress; typical symptoms include cramping, nausea, bloating, vomiting, and diarrhea.|$|E

2500|$|The hi-hat cymbals (nicknamed [...] "hats") {{consist of}} two cymbals mounted {{facing each other}} on a metal pole with folding support legs that keep a hollow support {{cylinder}} standing up. Like the bass drum, the hi-hat has a foot pedal. The bottom cymbal is fixed in place. The top cymbal is mounted on a thin pole which is inserted into the hollow cymbal stand cylinder. The thin pole is connected to a foot pedal. When the foot pedal is <b>pressed</b> <b>down,</b> a mechanism causes the thin pole to move down, causing the cymbals to move together. When the foot is lifted off the pedal, the cymbals move apart, due to the pedal's spring-loaded mechanism. The hi-hats can be sounded by striking the cymbals {{with one or two}} sticks or just by opening and closing the cymbals with the footpedal, without striking the cymbals. The ability to create rhythms on the hi-hats with the foot alone enables drummers to use both sticks on other drums or cymbals. Different sounds can be created by striking [...] "open hi-hats" [...] (without the pedal depressed, which creates a noisy sound nicknamed [...] "sloppy hats") or a crisp [...] "closed hi-hats" [...] sound (with the pedal <b>pressed</b> <b>down).</b> As well, the high hats can be played with a partially depressed pedal.|$|E
