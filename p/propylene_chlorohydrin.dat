Both isomers are colorless liquids that are soluble in organic solvents. They are classified as chlorohydrins.

50|$|In organic {{chemistry}} a halohydrin (also a haloalcohol or Î²-halo alcohol) is a functional group {{in which a}} halogen and a hydroxyl are bonded to adjacent carbon atoms, which otherwise bear only hydrogen or hydrocarbyl groups (e.g. 2-chloroethanol, 3-chloropropane-1,2-diol). The term only applies to saturated motifs, as such compounds like 2-chlorophenol would not normally be considered halohydrins. Megatons of some chlorohydrins, e.g. <b>propylene</b> <b>chlorohydrin,</b> are produced annually as precursors to polymers.|$|E

Other reported methods for producing 1,2,3-trichloropropane include the addition of chlorine to allyl chloride, reaction of thionyl chloride with glycerol, and the reaction of phosphorus pentachloride with either 1,3- or 2,3-dichloropropanol. TCP also may {{be produced}} as a byproduct of processes primarily used to produce chemicals such as dichloropropene (a soil fumigant), <b>propylene</b> <b>chlorohydrin,</b> propylene oxide, dichlorohydrin, and glycerol.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: A {{previous}} study reported a fivefold increase in mortality from pancreatic cancer and a threefold increase in lymphopoietic and haematopoietic cancer among 278 {{men who were}} assigned to a now dismantled Union Carbide chlorohydrin unit in the Kanawha Valley of West Virginia. There were also significant trends with duration of employment. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether a comparable increased risk in mortality from pancreatic cancer and lymphopoietic and haematopoietic cancer occurred among male employees assigned to the Dow Chemical Company's ethylene and <b>propylene</b> <b>chlorohydrin</b> production processes. METHODS: The cohort consisted of 1361 male employees who worked at the company's Freeport, Texas, Plaquemine, Louisiana or Midland, Michigan plants. Subjects were considered to have had a minimum of 30 days of workplace experience in 1940 - 92, in the ethylene chlorohydrin and <b>propylene</b> <b>chlorohydrin</b> process areas. These process areas were located within the ethylene oxide and propylene oxide production plants. A total of 300 deaths was observed to 31 December 1992. RESULTS: The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) for all malignant neoplasms was 94 (95 % CI 74 to 118). There was one pancreatic cancer death compared with 4. 0 expected (SMR 25, 95 % CI 1 to 140). There were 10 lymphopoietic and haematopoietic cancer deaths compared with 7. 7 expected (SMR 129, 95 % CI 62 to 238). Additional analyses, which examined location, production process, duration of employment, and a 25 year induction latency period, were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide some assurance that the Dow Chemical cohort, to date, has not experienced increased risks of pancreatic cancer and lymphopoietic and haematopoietic cancer as previously reported in a different cohort of chlorohydrin workers. Possible reasons are discussed for the inconsistent findings between the two cohorts...|$|E
40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{cohort study}} was conducted to examine the mortality experience of 2174 men employed between 1940 and 1978 by a large chemical company and who had been assigned to a chemical production department that used or produced ethylene oxide (EO). Comparisons were made with the general United States population, the regional population, and with a group of 26, 965 unexposed men from the same plants. Comparisons with general United States death rates showed fewer deaths than expected in the EO group due to all causes and for total cancers. There was no statistically significant excess of deaths due to any cause. Seven deaths each due to leukaemia and pancreatic cancer were observed with 3. 0 and 4. 1 deaths expected. Among the subcohort of men who worked where both average and peak exposure levels were probably highest, however, one death due to pancreatic cancer (0. 9 expected) and no deaths due to leukaemia were observed. Four of the seven who died from leukaemia and six of the seven who died from pancreatic cancer had been assigned to the chlorohydrin department where the potential for exposure to EO is judged to have been low. The relative risk of death due to each disease was strongly related to duration of assignments to that department. When men who worked in the chlorohydrin department were excluded, there was no evidence for an association of exposure to EO with pancreatic cancer or leukaemia. Together with the failure to show independent EO associations, the chlorohydrin department results suggest that leukaemia and pancreatic cancer may have been associated primarily with production of ethylene chlorohydrin or <b>propylene</b> <b>chlorohydrin,</b> or both. These results emphasise the importance of examining additional concurrent/asynchronous exposures among human populations exposed to EO...|$|E
