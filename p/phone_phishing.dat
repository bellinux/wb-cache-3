25|$|Several {{companies}} offer {{banks and other}} organizations {{likely to suffer from}} phishing scams round-the-clock services to monitor, analyze and assist in shutting down phishing websites. Individuals can contribute by reporting phishing to both volunteer and industry groups, such as cyscon or PhishTank. Individuals can also contribute by reporting <b>phone</b> <b>phishing</b> attempts to <b>Phone</b> <b>Phishing,</b> Federal Trade Commission. Phishing web pages and emails can be reported to Google. The Internet Crime Complaint Center noticeboard carries phishing and ransomware alerts.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Phone</b> <b>phishing</b> (or [...] "vishing") uses a rogue {{interactive}} voice response (IVR) system to recreate a legitimate-sounding copy of a bank or other institution's IVR system. The victim is prompted (typically via a phishing e-mail) to call in to the [...] "bank" [...] via a (ideally toll free) number provided in order to [...] "verify" [...] information. A typical [...] "vishing" [...] system will reject log-ins continually, ensuring the victim enters PINs or passwords multiple times, often disclosing several different passwords. More advanced systems transfer the victim to the attacker/defrauder, who poses as a customer service agent or security expert for further questioning of the victim.|$|E
5000|$|Phishing is a scam {{by which}} an e-mail user is duped into {{revealing}} personal or confidential information which the scammer (phisher) can use illicitly. Communications purporting {{to be from}} popular social web sites, auction sites, banks, online payment processors or IT administrators are commonly used to lure unsuspecting public. Phishing emails may contain links to websites that are infected with malware. [...] Phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing or instant messaging, and it often directs users to enter details at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one. There are four main type of phishing techniques: link manipulation, filter evasion, website forgery, and <b>phone</b> <b>phishing.</b> Legislation, user training, public awareness, and technical security measures are all attempts to control {{the growing number of}} phishing attacks. The damage caused by phishing ranges from denial of access to email to substantial financial loss. It is estimated that between May 2004 and May 2005, approximately 1.2 million computer users in the United States suffered losses caused by phishing, totaling approximately US$929 million. United States businesses lose an estimated US$2 billion per year as their clients become victims.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} the increasing threat of phishing attacks on mobile platforms. In fact, mobile phishing is more dangerous due to the limitations of mobile phones and mobile user habits. Existing schemes designed for phishing attacks on computers/laptops cannot effectively address phishing attacks on mobile devices. This paper presents MobiFish, a novel automated lightweight anti-phishing scheme for mobile platforms. MobiFish verifies the validity of web pages and applications (Apps) by comparing the actual identity to the identity claimed by the web pages and Apps. MobiFish has been implemented on the Nexus 4 smartphone running the Android 4. 2 operating system. We experimentally evaluate the performance of MobiFish with 100 phishing URLs and corresponding legitimate URLs, as well as fake Facebook Apps. The result shows that MobiFish is very effective in detecting phishing attacks on mobile <b>phones.</b> Keywords—Mobile phones; <b>phishing</b> attack; security; Android I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Although most {{organizations}} {{around the}} world currently {{pay more attention to}} securing information systems by means of sophisticated security tools, their information systems still remain breachable. The interpretation of this reality is that the hackers resort to the use of social engineering instead of using their technical skills to acquire information. The concept of social engineering is essentially to manipulate the users of a system, that are considered to be the weakest links on the chain, in order to get said information. The objective {{of this study is to}} prove that users of information systems are considered to be the real threat themselves. In this study, we assume that the lack of awareness of social engineering among users makes information systems susceptible to numerous kinds of breaches. In addition to that, the study aims to examine whether IT students possess more awareness of social engineering than students from other faculties. To address these problems, the data was collected from 245 students of the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM), via an online survey and questionnaire. Moreover, a <b>phishing</b> <b>phone</b> experiment conducted among a small number of students. The exhibited results showing that a total of 114 students were exposed to social engineering attacks during the last six months, and almost 38 % of these attacks through E-mail...|$|R
40|$|Phishing {{is a form}} of {{electronic}} identity theft in which a combination of social engineering and web site spoofing techniques are used to trick a user into revealing confidential information with economic value. The problem of social engineering attack {{is that there is no}} single solution to eliminate it completely, since it deals largely with the human factor. This is why implementing empirical experiments is very crucial in order to study and to analyze all malicious and deceiving phishing website attack techniques and strategies. In this paper, three different kinds of phishing experiment case studies have been conducted to shed some light into social engineering attacks, such as <b>phone</b> <b>phishing</b> and phishing website attacks for designing effective countermeasures and analyzing the efficiency of performing security awareness about phishing threats. Results and reactions to our experiments show the importance of conducting phishing training awareness for all users and doubling our efforts in developing phishing prevention techniques. Results also suggest that traditional standard security phishing factor indicators are not always effective for detecting phishing websites, and alternative intelligent phishing detection approaches are needed...|$|E
