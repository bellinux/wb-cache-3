5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century the fraternity system continued to expand at such a rapid <b>pace</b> <b>that</b> university newspapers questioned if the increase in the number of fraternities would ever end. Many fraternity chapters were founded during this time that no longer exist at the university, such Alpha Chi Rho, Theta Nu Epsilon, and Delta Chi. Other chapters that are still active were founded at this time as well, such as Theta Chi and Phi Sigma Kappa.|$|E
5|$|During 1928–1973, the Soviet Union {{was growing}} {{economically}} at a <b>pace</b> <b>that</b> would eventually {{catch up with}} the United States and Western Europe. This was true despite the advantage the United States had — the USSR was hampered by the effects of World War II, which had left most of Western USSR in ruins. In 1973, the process of catching up {{with the rest of the}} West came to an abrupt end, and 1973 was seen by some scholars as the start of the Era of Stagnation. The beginning of the stagnation coincided with a financial crisis in Western Europe and the U.S. By the early 1970s, the Soviet Union had the world's second largest industrial capacity, and produced more steel, oil, pig-iron, cement and tractors than any other country. Before 1973, the Soviet economy was expanding at faster rate than that of the American economy (albeit by a very small margin). The USSR also kept a steady pace with the economies of Western Europe. Between 1964 and 1973, the Soviet economy stood at roughly half the output per head of Western Europe and a little more than one third that of the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{their opponents}} {{were able to}} lift and the final saw Steve Lundquist of the United States set a new world record of 1m 1.65s; Evans took bronze, 0.98s behind silver medallist Davis. Evans was unable to {{maintain}} the <b>pace</b> <b>that</b> he had set in the heats, clocking a time 0.10s slower. In the 200m, Evans came second in his heat but was not fast {{enough to make the}} final, swimming 1.47s slower than the slowest qualifier to finish 17th. The final event for Evans was the 4×100m medley relay. Evans was joined by Kerry, while Glenn Buchanan and Mark Stockwell swum the butterfly and freestyle respectively. The Americans were overwhelming favourites, boasting the gold medallists in three of the respective individual events. The hosts easily won the gold by almost four seconds; Evans and the Australians were third, relegated from the silver medal by just 0.02s by the Canadian team, having been in the bronze medal position at every change. Evans recorded the second-fastest breaststroke split, slower than Lundquist, but quicker than the rest, including Davis.|$|E

5|$|Prescott {{spent the}} winter in Boston, and {{returned}} to the composition of his work. He gradually changed the focus of the History, deciding that he was a better writer of history than biography and worked solidly for the next two years, alternating between Boston and Nahant. This period was interrupted only by the marriage of his daughter Elizabeth in early 1852. Her husband was James Alexander; they settled in a house near the family home in Pepperell. Prescott's mother fell ill on May 17 and died soon after, which caused Prescott to fall into a bout of depression that lasted until the winter. He returned to his work, and continued at the <b>pace</b> <b>that</b> he was able through the remainder of 1852 and 1853, which passed uneventfully. Prescott started to suffer seriously from rheumatism during the former year, and as a result he abandoned his residence at Nahant. He bought a house in the then rural town of Lynn, Massachusetts, where he was visited by Charles Lyell and his family in June 1853. On August 22, he finished the second volume of the History. The first two volumes were finished by May 1855, but not immediately published. Changes in British copyright law and a change of publishers caused Prescott to delay publication until November. Compared to his previous works, the History received little coverage in the press or in academic journals. It was suggested to him at this time that he should write a biography of Charles V, but he declined, as he regarded the work of William Robertson on the subject to be definitive. However, he wrote an appendix to Robertson's The History of the reign of Charles V in May 1855; it was published in December 1856. Previously uninterested in politics (although he had predicted the Whig victory in 1840,) Prescott supported and voted for the Republican John C. Frémont in the 1856 Presidential election. He continued to work on the third volume of the History until he suffered a stroke on 3 February 1858. Prescott recovered, but his health was permanently affected, and he decided to temporarily retire from writing. The third volume was therefore published in April, and its scope was more limited than Prescott had originally planned. He worked on the Spanish translation of the Conquest of Mexico, which had been prepared by José Fernando Ramírez and Lucas Alamán.|$|E
25|$|There {{was wide}} {{agreement}} {{on the need to}} settle the new territories quickly, but the debate polarized over the price the government should charge. The conservatives and Whigs, typified by president John Quincy Adams, wanted a moderated <b>pace</b> <b>that</b> charged the newcomers enough to pay the costs of the federal government. The Democrats, however, tolerated a wild scramble for land at very low prices. The final resolution came in the Homestead Law of 1862, with a moderated <b>pace</b> <b>that</b> gave settlers 160 acres free after they worked on it for five years.|$|E

25|$|The growth <b>pace</b> <b>that</b> the Moroccan economy {{witnessed}} {{since the}} beginning of the 1998–2007 decade has generated significant progress in terms of national income, employment and living standards. However, the results obtained show considerable disparities in terms of the distribution of the fruit of this growth, whether between the production factors, the socio-economic groups or the urban and rural areas. In fact, the national income grew at an average annual rate of 5.5% during the 1998–2007 decade. This improvement in the national income however seems to be insufficient to face up to the discrepancies in terms of living standards and the scale of deficits at the social level.|$|E
25|$|Mitchell Energy had a near-monopoly in {{drilling}} Barnett Shale {{wells in}} the early years of the field. In 1995, for instance, Mitchell completed 70 Barnett wells, while all other operators combined completed three. This was largely because the Barnett was marginal economically: according to a former CEO, Mitchell had invested about $250 million in the Barnett from 1981 to 1997, and had not recouped its costs. But after 1997, competitors realized that Mitchell had discovered how to extract gas profitably, they, too started buying leases and drilling Barnett wells, at a <b>pace</b> <b>that</b> Mitchell could not match. In 2001, for the first time, Mitchell completed fewer than half the Barnett Shale wells (258 wells, versus 260 by other operators).|$|E

25|$|After {{playing for}} local clubs, {{he joined the}} Leicestershire CCC ground staff as a fast bowler in 1905 but, because he wore spectacles, was not re-engaged {{at the end of}} the season. He then joined Kidderminster in the Birmingham League and {{achieved}} such success that in 1912 the county re-signed him and he continued with them until he retired in 1929. He made his debut in county cricket in 1912, and played fairly regularly in the two seasons before the first world war. It was in the middle and late 1920s, however, when he was around his 40th year and far past the retirement age of most bowlers of his <b>pace,</b> <b>that</b> he showed remarkable skill as a genuinely fast bowler. In a sometimes bleak era for English fast bowling, he was at times the fastest bowler in the country.|$|E
25|$|The {{simultaneous}} twin {{objectives of}} bowling are to take wickets and prevent run scoring opportunities. Both objectives are achieved through the underlying aim of bowling {{the ball in}} such a way that the batsman is unable to connect with the ball in the middle of the bat and control its movement after contact. There are three distinct means of achieving this aim: by bowling the ball on a good line and length, by bowling with sufficient <b>pace</b> <b>that</b> the batsman struggles to react to the delivery, or by bowling the ball {{in such a way}} that it has lateral movement as it approaches the batsman, either in the air or off the ground. A good bowler may be able to combine two of these skills, a truly great bowler may be able to combine all three.|$|E
25|$|During {{the reign}} of Charles II, Spanish power and {{prestige}} declined at an accelerated <b>pace,</b> <b>that</b> started {{in the last years}} of Count-Duke of Olivares' prime ministership in the 1640s. The economy, on the whole, was depressed between 1650 and 1700, with low productivity, famines, and epidemics. Spain's economy (especially in Castile) crumbled. This was partially due to plague outbreaks, for example during 1676–1685, and partially due to the heavy taxation and huge casualties caused by the almost continuous warfare. The period 1677–1686 was the lowest point; there was famine, natural disasters, and economic chaos. Emigration to the New World increased; with the population of Spain decreasing by nearly two million people during the 17th century: nearly 1.25 million from plagues, and 300,000 from the expulsion of the Moriscos. Spanish territory shrank with the loss to France of some territories in the Spanish Netherlands.|$|E
