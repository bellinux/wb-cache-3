500|$|Lysgårdsbakken, officially {{known as}} Lysgårdsbakkene Ski Jumping Arena (...) , is a ski jumping hill in Lillehammer, Norway. It {{consists}} of a large hill, with a K-point of 123 and a hill size of 138, and a small hill with a K-point of 90 and a hill size of 100. It opened in 1993 for the 1994 Winter Olympics, where it hosted the ski jumping and Nordic combined events, {{as well as the}} opening and closing ceremonies. After the Olympics, ownership was transferred to the municipal Lillehammer Olympiapark and it has since been used for several FIS Ski Jumping World Cup and FIS Nordic Combined World Cup tournaments, including hosting the Nordic Tournament. It has a capacity for 35,000 spectators and is one of three national ski jumping hills in Norway. In 2007, the large hill was rebuilt to a larger profile, and received a new <b>plastic</b> <b>lining.</b> The venue sees 80,000 annual jumps in the winter and 20,000 in the summer season.|$|E

40|$|Spoolable {{reinforced}} <b>plastic</b> <b>line</b> pipe will {{be widely}} used in the exploitation of acid gas and oil wells. End-fitting is a mechanical device that forms {{the transition from the}} spoolable reinforced <b>plastic</b> <b>line</b> pipe to the connector. It was well known that nickel was an important element in the end-fitting. In this paper, a novel spectrophotometric method was described for determination of nickel in the end-fitting of spoolable reinforced <b>plastic</b> <b>line</b> pipe. The method was based on the color reaction between nickel and dimethylglyoxime, which was favored in an alkaline medium, producing a red compound in the presence of ammonium persulfate as an oxidant. Under the optimum reaction conditions the absorption value was proportional to the concentration of nickel in the range of 0. 080 ~ 0. 50 % (R 2 = 0. 9999), and the relative standard deviation was less than 3. 0 % (n= 5). The proposed method was applied successfully to determine nickel in end-fitting of spoolable reinforced <b>plastic</b> <b>line</b> pipe...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES Male {{reproductive}} health has deteriorated in recent decades. It is proposed that increased testicular temperature in early childhood, {{due to the}} use of modern disposable <b>plastic</b> <b>lined</b> nappies (diapers), could be an important factor contributing to this decline. STUDY DESIGN Scrotal skin temperature was measured non-invasively in 48 healthy children aged 0 - 55 months (three age groups) for two 24 hour periods in randomised order (either cotton or disposable <b>plastic</b> <b>lined</b> nappies) using a portable, miniature recorder. RESULTS Mean 24 hour scrotal temperature (2880 measurements) was significantly higher in all age groups during the periods of plastic nappy use than with cotton nappies (p < 0. 001). The rectoscrotal temperature difference was significantly higher with cotton than with plastic nappy use (p < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS Scrotal hypothermia is an important factor for normal spermatogenesis. This study shows that scrotal temperature, which closely reflects testicular temperature, is increased in boys wearing disposable <b>plastic</b> <b>lined</b> nappies. The physiological testicular cooling mechanism is blunted and often completely abolished during plastic nappy use. The present results establish the basis for further research on the impact of increased testicular temperature in infancy on later spermatogenesis...|$|R

40|$|How {{vulnerable}} is {{the developing}} testis {{to the external}} environment? The onset of spermatogenesis occurs during puberty, before adult blood levels of testosterone are achieved. It can be detected early {{by the presence of}} spermaturia. 1 Sperm maturation is a temperature dependent process and most male mammals have externally sited gonads to main-tain testicular hypothermy. In this issue of ADC, Partsch and colleagues (page 364) report the eVect of reusable cotton versus <b>plastic</b> <b>lined</b> disposable nappies (diapers) on scrotal skin temperature during infancy and early childhood. 2 Studies in adult men showed a strong correla-tion between intratesticular and scrotal skin temperatures. 3 The use of <b>plastic</b> <b>lined</b> nappies resulted in significantly higher mean 24 hour scrotal skin temperatures in the 4...|$|R

40|$|A common {{method of}} {{treating}} the mean stress effect on fatigue {{life is to}} displace the elastic line on a Manson-Coffin-Basquin diagram while retaining {{the position of the}} <b>plastic</b> <b>line.</b> Manson and Halford pointed out that this procedure implies that mean stress significantly affects the cyclic stress-strain curve. Actually, however, they showed experimentally and by more general reasoning, that mean stress has little, if any, effect on the cyclic stress-strain curve. Thus, they concluded {{that it is necessary to}} displace the <b>plastic</b> <b>line</b> as well as the elastic line in order to keep the cyclic stress-strain curve unaltered. Another way to express the common displacement of the two lines is to keep the lines in place and change the horizontal coordinate to include a term relating to the displacement. Thus, instead of life, 2 N sub f, as the horizontal coordinate, a new coordinate can become 2 N sub f (1 -sigma sub m/sigma sub f) superscript 1 /b, thereby displacing both the elastic and <b>plastic</b> <b>lines</b> by an amount (1 -sigma sub m/sigma sub f) superscript 1 /b where sigma sub m is the mean stress and sigma sub f is the intercept of the elastic line at N sub f = 1 / 2 cycles and b is the slope of the elastic line...|$|R

50|$|One {{important}} use of bioceramics is in {{hip replacement}} surgery. The materials {{used for the}} replacement hip joints were usually metals such as titanium, with the hip socket usually lined with plastic. The multiaxial ball was tough metal ball but was eventually replaced with a longer-lasting ceramic ball. This reduced the roughening associated with the metal wall against the <b>plastic</b> <b>lining</b> of the artificial hip socket.

50|$|Shower {{doors are}} doors used in {{bathrooms}} that help keep water inside a shower or bathtub and are alternatives to shower curtains. They {{are available in}} many different styles such as framed or frameless, sliding or swing. They are usually constructed of aluminium, clear glass, plexi-glass or tempered glass. Shower doors can come in many different hardware finishes and glass patterns that can match other bathroom hardware such as faucets and shower heads. There are also shower doors that are in a neo angle design for use on shower pans that have the neo design as well. The design of the shower pan is extremely important as the shower door must be the type required for the pan in order to work. A shower door requires <b>plastic</b> <b>lining</b> {{along the edges of}} the door to protect against water leaking out.|$|E
50|$|The {{laminated}} carton {{was among}} the most innovative developments in packaging over the last 60 years. Laminated cartons are made from layers of paper board fused with a <b>plastic</b> <b>lining</b> containing a small amount of aluminium. The packaging can keep liquids fresh over long distances and periods of time, locked within a safe seal.The composition of laminated cartons makes it difficult to separate the various components from the paper. Recycling cartons is therefore more complicated than simply recycling paper and/or pieces of plastic.There are no recycling facilities available for laminated cartons in the UK at the moment so post-consumer cartons that are collected by local councils are sent to land fill in the UK or shipped to mainland Europe for incineration or specialist recycling. The global recycling rate of laminated cartons is approximately 20% of the 175 billion cartons sold in 2011.|$|E

40|$|Cultivated flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) is an {{important}} plant valuable for industry. Some flax lines can undergo heritable phenotypic and genotypic changes (LIS- 1 insertion being the most common) in response to nutrient stress and are called <b>plastic</b> <b>lines.</b> Offspring of <b>plastic</b> <b>lines,</b> which stably inherit the changes, are called genotrophs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{are involved in a}} crucial regulatory mechanism of gene expression. They have previously been assumed to take part in nutrient stress response and can, therefore, participate in genotroph formation. In the present study, we performed high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs extracted from flax plants grown under normal, phosphate deficient and nutrient excess conditions to identify miRNAs and evaluate their expression. Our analysis revealed expression of 96 conserved miRNAs from 21 families in flax. Moreover, 475 novel potential miRNAs were identified for the first time, and their targets were predicted. However, none of the identified miRNAs were transcribed from LIS- 1. Expression of 7 miRNAs (miR 168, miR 169, miR 395, miR 398, miR 399, miR 408, and lus-miR-N 1) with up- or down-regulation under nutrient stress (on the basis of high-throughput sequencing data) was evaluated on extended sampling using qPCR. Reference gene search identified ETIF 3 H and ETIF 3 E genes as most suitable for this purpose. Down-regulation of novel potential lus-miR-N 1 and up-regulation of conserved miR 399 were revealed under the phosphate deficient conditions. In addition, the negative correlation of expression of lus-miR-N 1 and its predicted target, ubiquitin-activating enzyme E 1 gene, as well as, miR 399 and its predicted target, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E 2 gene, was observed. Thus, in our study, miRNAs expressed in flax <b>plastic</b> <b>lines</b> and genotrophs were identified and their expression and expression of their targets was evaluated using high-throughput sequencing and qPCR for the first time.
