500|$|Bockscar {{was flown}} on 9 August 1945, by {{the crew of}} another B-29, The Great Artiste, and piloted by Major Charles W. Sweeney, {{commander}} of the 393d Bombardment Squadron. The plane was co-piloted by First Lieutenant Charles Donald Albury, the normal aircraft commander of Crew C-15. The Great Artiste was designated as the observation, instrumentation support plane for the second mission, and another B-29, The Big Stink, flown by Group Operations Officer Major James I. Hopkins, Jr., as the <b>photographic</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The mission had as its primary target the city of Kokura, where the [...] Kokura Arsenal was located. Its secondary target was Nagasaki, where two large Mitsubishi armament plants were located.|$|E
500|$|On 28 May 1944, Loper was {{appointed}} Chief Engineer of US Army Forces, Pacific Ocean Areas (USAFPOA), {{on the specific}} request of the commander of USAFPOA, Lieutenant General Robert C. Richardson, Jr. Loper immediately became involved in planning for the [...] Mariana and Palau Islands campaign. He discovered that the US Navy and Marine Corps did not have adequate map making units, so the task had to be undertaken by the Army. The 64th Topographic Battalion {{was assigned to the}} task of mapping the Caroline Islands and Palau. However, until B-29 <b>photographic</b> <b>aircraft</b> could be based in the Mariana Islands, much of the aerial survey had to be carried out by aircraft carrier-based naval aircraft. Later Loper, who was promoted to brigadier general on 11 November 1944, was involved in gathering engineer intelligence for the Battle of Iwo Jima, the Okinawa campaign, and Operation Olympic. When USAFPOA was merged with General of the Army Douglas MacArthur's Southwest Pacific Area in 1945, Loper became Chief of Engineer Intelligence under Major General Hugh J. Casey. After the fighting ended, Loper became Deputy Engineer of United States Far East Command during the Occupation of Japan. For his services in the Pacific, he was awarded the Legion of Merit on 22 September 1945. He was awarded a second Legion of Merit for his services during the Occupation of Japan on 11 September 1948.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of the production Autocars were exported to sixteen countries and later resold in five further territories. The Autocar has been primarily operated by private pilot owners and by aero clubs but some were used by small charter firms in the UK and elsewhere as taxi and <b>photographic</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Pest Control Ltd took delivery of five J/5G Autocars in 1952 for crop spraying operations in Sudan.|$|E
50|$|Moved to India, February-March 1944 and {{assigned}} to Tenth Air Force. Equipped with F-5, F-6, and F7 aircraft. Conducted photographic reconnaissance, photographic, mapping, and visual reconnaissance missions. Products created ranged from maps, mosaics, terrain models, to target charts of areas in Burma, China, French Indochina, and Thailand. Personnel also bombed and strafed enemy installations and provided escort for bombardment units, since the <b>photographic</b> <b>aircraft</b> were dual-capable as bombers.|$|E

5000|$|VFP-206 {{would be}} the last US Navy unit to operate the F-8 Crusader and was the last {{specialized}} <b>photographic</b> reconnaissance <b>aircraft</b> in Navy service.

5000|$|Dunn Spur (...) is a {{prominent}} rock spur which descends from Mount Blackburn and extends for 5 nmi km {{along the north}} side of Van Reeth Glacier, in the Queen Maud Mountains of Antarctica. It was mapped by the United States Geological Survey from surveys and from U.S. Navy air photos, 1960-63, and was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for Thomas H. Dunn of U.S. Navy Squadron VX-6, an aircrewman on <b>photographic</b> <b>aircraft</b> over Antarctica on Operation Deep Freeze 1964, 1966 and 1967.|$|E
50|$|Pursuit planes {{protected}} {{observation aircraft}} during these missions. The {{large number of}} enemy pursuit aircraft operating in the area made an attack during photographic flights almost a certainty. The pursuit protectors often flew about 500 meters above the observation aircraft. This gave them an advantage against enemy attackers. <b>Photographic</b> <b>aircraft</b> also flew during large bombing and pursuit operations {{to take advantage of}} the amassed firepower. The four black crosses on the 9th Reconnaissance Wing’s emblem today represent 1st and 99th Squadrons’ participation at St. Mihiel, Argonne-Meuse, Champagne-Marne and Aisne-Marne.|$|E
50|$|The first USAAF unit {{to use the}} {{airfield}} was the 13th Photographic Squadron of Lockheed F-5 (P-38) Lightning <b>photographic</b> <b>aircraft</b> which moved in for tutorage in March 1943 under the experienced RAF establishment. This was the 13th Photographic Squadron. The need for more photographic reconnaissance of targets by the Eighth Air Force led to other American photo/recon squadrons being assigned to the station and on 7 July 1943, the 7th Photographic Group was established at Mount Farm, the group being transferred from Peterson AAF Colorado and absorbing {{the assets of the}} 13th photo squadron.|$|E
50|$|The 183d was {{initially}} equipped with World War II-era Douglas RB-26C Invader night <b>photographic</b> reconnaissance <b>aircraft.</b> The black RB-26s were light bombers that were modified for aerial reconnaissance {{in the late}} 1940s. Most of the aircraft received were unarmed Korean War veterans, which carried cameras and flash flares for night aerial photography. Upon mobilization, the squadron would be gained by Tactical Air Command (TAC).|$|R
50|$|Six were {{produced}} as the Pembroke C(PR).1 <b>photographic</b> reconnaissance <b>aircraft.</b> These saw use by No. 81 Squadron RAF during the Malayan Emergency. The RAF's Pembrokes were modified {{to extend their}} lifespan in 1970. The last unit to use them was No. 60 Squadron RAF based at RAF Wildenrath in Germany, these were withdrawn from use in 1988 and were replaced by the Hawker Siddeley Andover.|$|R
25|$|The Northrop F-15 Reporter (later RF-61) was an American unarmed <b>photographic</b> {{reconnaissance}} <b>aircraft.</b> Based on the Northrop P-61 Black Widow night fighter, it was {{the last}} piston-powered photo-reconnaissance aircraft designed and produced for the United States Air Force. Though produced in limited quantities, and with a relatively short service life, the F-15's aerial photographs of the Korean Peninsula would prove vital in 1950, when North Korea invaded the south.|$|R
