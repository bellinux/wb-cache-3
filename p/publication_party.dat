He should have called their book The Naked and the Dead." ...|$|E

5000|$|After {{deciding}} what subjects and authors to include, {{and how to}} present the materials, the project was begun, with a budget of $2,000,000. On April 15, 1952, the Great Books of the Western World were presented at a <b>publication</b> <b>party</b> in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, in New York City. In his speech, Hutchins said, [...] "This {{is more than a}} set of books, and more than a liberal education. Great Books of the Western World is an act of piety. Here are the sources of our being. Here is our heritage. This is the West. This is its meaning for mankind." [...] The first two sets of books were given to Elizabeth II, Queen of the U.K., and to Harry S. Truman, the incumbent U.S. President.|$|E
50|$|The {{party was}} further disorganized by the churn of its rank-and-file members {{in and out}} of the party, {{exemplified}} by the count of Wellington members booming from 51 in March to 80 by May 1931 before plummeting to just 25 in January 1932. Things grew so bad that by October 1932 only one member of the Central Executive Committee had been a member of the party for longer than a year, with some members for as little as two months. The party was impoverished, its coffers drained both by the cost of producing the Red Worker (rival publication to the mainstream trade unionist Maoriland Worker), and by courtroom losses in several libel cases brought against that <b>publication.</b> <b>Party</b> publications were carefully scrutinized, with two issues of the Red Worker and a pamphlet found to be seditious in 1932 and those responsible for their publication jailed for more than a year.|$|E

5000|$|Kesey {{had flown}} to New York in November 1963 {{with his wife}} Faye and Prankster George Walker to attend the Broadway opening of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (play). He also managed to see the 1964 New York World's Fair site under construction. Kesey needed to return to New York the {{following}} year for the <b>publication</b> <b>party</b> for his novel Sometimes a Great Notion and hoped to use the occasion to visit the Fair after it opened. This plan gradually grew into an ambitious scheme to bring along {{a group of friends}} and turn their adventures into a road movie, taking inspiration from Jack Kerouac's On the Road. As more Pranksters volunteered for the trip they soon realized they had outgrown Kesey's station wagon, so Kesey bought a retired yellow school bus for $1,250 from Andre Hobson of Atherton, California. The license plates read [...] "MAZ 804". Hobson had already added bunks, a bathroom, and a kitchen with refrigerator and stove for taking his 11 kids on vacation.|$|E
