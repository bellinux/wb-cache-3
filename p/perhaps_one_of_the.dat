5|$|As critic Richard Roeper has stated, <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strongest {{indicators}} {{of the influence of}} Sesame Street has been the enduring rumors and urban legends surrounding the show and its characters, especially those concerning Bert and Ernie.|$|E
5|$|Electronic devices {{make use}} of the transistor, <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{important}} inventions of the twentieth century, and a fundamental building block of all modern circuitry. A modern integrated circuit may contain several billion miniaturised transistors in a region only a few centimetres square.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, despite setbacks, financially tight {{times and}} the American Civil War, the College {{continued}} to expand. Seton Hall opened a military science department (forerunner to the ROTC program) {{during the summer of}} 1893, but this program was ultimately disbanded during the Spanish–American War. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most pivotal events in the history of Seton Hall came in 1897 when Seton Hall's preparatory (high school) and college (undergraduate) divisions were permanently separated. By 1937, Seton Hall established a University College. This marked the first matriculation of women at Seton Hall. Seton Hall became fully coeducational in 1968. In 1948, Seton Hall was given a license by the FCC for WSOU-FM.|$|E

5|$|Popery is {{favourable}} to ceremony; {{and among}} the ignorant nations ceremony is <b>the</b> only preservative <b>of</b> tradition. Since Protestantism was extended to <b>the</b> savage parts <b>of</b> Scotland, it has <b>perhaps</b> been <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chief labours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ministers to abolish stated observances, because they continued <b>the</b> remembrance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former religion.|$|R
40|$|Pediatric {{overweight}} and obesity, which affects approximately 10 % of children worldwide {{has been described}} as an epidemic and <b>perhaps</b> as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most pressing threats to <b>the</b> health <b>of</b> children and families in developed countries. It is strongly associated with physical and psychosocial health consequences prompting calls for more effective prevention and treatment efforts to curb the current and increasing prevalence...|$|R
5|$|For a brief period, the Romans were in {{complete}} disarray. Their best armies in the peninsula were destroyed, the few remnants severely demoralized, {{and the only}} remaining consul (Varro) completely discredited. As the story goes, Rome declared a national day of mourning as {{there was not a}} single person who was not either related to or acquainted with a person who had died. The Romans became so desperate that they resorted to human sacrifice, twice burying people alive at the Forum of Rome and abandoning an oversized baby in the Adriatic Sea (<b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last instances of human sacrifices by the Romans, apart from public executions of defeated enemies dedicated to Mars).|$|E
5|$|Symbolic {{behavior}} is, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{most difficult}} aspects of modern human behavior to distinguish archaeologically. When searching {{for evidence of}} symbolic behavior in the MSA, there are three lines of evidence that can be considered: direct evidence reflecting concrete examples of symbols; indirect evidence reflecting behaviors {{that would have been}} used to convey symbolic thought; and technological evidence reflecting the tools and skills that would have been used to produce art. Direct evidence is difficult to find beyond 40ka, and indirect evidence is essentially intangible, thus technological evidence is the most fruitful of the three.|$|E
5|$|The news of Raj's {{possible}} arrest {{provoked a}} heightened {{attack on the}} North Indians in the industrial town of Nashik in Maharashtra, Raj's political stronghold. North Indians left the city by buses, trains and private vehicles. Railway officials at Nashik station {{said that this was}} the largest crowd using the railroad since the Sinhasta Kumbha Mela in 2003–2004. It was <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest exoduses from a single district in the country ever. Chhagan Bhujbal, Nashik's guardian minister, reported that 15,000migrant workers had left the city {{in the aftermath of the}} violence against North Indians.|$|E
50|$|In 1551 {{a marble}} {{statue of a}} seated figure (originally female, <b>perhaps</b> personifying <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sciences) was purportedly found in <b>the</b> {{cemetery}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Via Tiburtina and was heavily restored. On <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seat was carved a paschal cycle, and on the back <b>the</b> titles <b>of</b> numerous writings by Hippolytus. Many other works are listed by Eusebius of Caesarea and Jerome.|$|R
50|$|The {{church was}} {{building}} in the 16th century in a Greek Cross layout with a central octagonal dome with a small lantern. It is claimed {{that this was the}} first parish church in Cameri. It likely filled this function after 1583, while the present San Michele was being erected. At some point, <b>perhaps</b> after <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frequent plague epidemics, the church was dedicated to St Roch.|$|R
2500|$|As a form, {{strategy}} {{was said to}} be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> [...] "Ten Abilities and Seven Arts" [...] that a warrior should have, but Musashi disagrees that one person can gain strategy by being confined to one particular style, which seems particularly fitting as he admits [...] "I practice many arts and abilities — all things with no teacher" [...] — this <b>perhaps</b> being <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reasons he was so highly regarded a swordsman.|$|R
25|$|A {{memorial}} cross for Lord Kitchener {{was unveiled}} at St Botolph's church in 1916 (near Liverpool Street station), <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first memorials of the First World War in England.|$|E
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{striking}} applications of systoles {{is in the}} context of the Schottky problem, by P.Buser and P.Sarnak, who distinguished the Jacobians of Riemann surfaces among principally polarized abelian varieties, laying the foundation for systolic arithmetic.|$|E
25|$|The large Jaina temple, {{among the}} many temples at Lakkundi, also near Gadag, is <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{earliest}} examples of temples in this area built {{of a kind of}} fine-textured chloritic schist as distinct from the hitherto-used sandstone of this region.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Perhaps</b> surprisingly, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{most famous}} names in Burgundy has no Grand Crus, {{although}} there have been calls for Les Perrieres to be so designated ever since it was described as [...] "tête de cuvée" [...] in the 1855 list. Meursault grows Chardonnay almost exclusively (note <b>the</b> exception <b>of</b> Santenots mentioned in the Volnay section), which makes wonderfully rich and buttery white Burgundy, developing a certain nuttiness with time. The Premier Crus occupy 132ha <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 437ha.|$|R

25|$|With {{controversy}} at last left behind, the Formula One teams flourished through <b>the</b> remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1980s {{and into}} the 1990s. Despite <b>the</b> overwhelming dominance <b>of</b> two teams—McLaren and Williams—this period is regarded (<b>perhaps</b> ironically) as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brightest spots in F1's 50-year history.|$|R
25|$|Abu Bakr {{was fully}} aware of Umar's power and ability to succeed him. Succession of Umar was thus not as {{troublesome}} {{as any of the}} others. His was <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smoothest transitions of power from one authority to another in the Muslim lands.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} several {{theological}} discourses, Gregory {{was also one}} of the most important early Christian men of letters, a very accomplished orator, <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greatest of his time. Gregory was also a very prolific poet who wrote theological, moral and biographical poems.|$|E
25|$|The {{granting}} of citizenship to allies and the conquered was a vital {{step in the}} process of Romanization. This step {{was one of the most}} effective political tools and (at that point in history) original political ideas (<b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important reasons for the success of Rome).|$|E
40|$|The oft-referenced "E = mc 2 " may <b>perhaps</b> be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's {{most famous}} equations, but it {{actually}} represents only <b>one</b> aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complex branch <b>of</b> physics known as relativity. Together, relativity and quantum mechanics explain both the most cosmic and most elementary relationships and processes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe. The profound place that relativity and quantum mechanics occupy in subverting longstanding notions about space, time, matter, {{and more and}} the brilliant individuals who advanced study in these fields are <b>the</b> subjects <b>of</b> this volume...|$|R
50|$|Note {{that while}} the {{windfall}} gain/ton is fairly modest , because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vast size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coal allocations, the total figure for the windfall gain is very large. Note also that the figure stated as a windfall gain would in fact accrue to the allocatee over <b>the</b> life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reserve, which would likely exceed 100 years. Thus, using any reasonable discount rate, <b>the</b> Present value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> windfall gain will be dramatically smaller (<b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> tenth) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> windfall gain stated in the CAG Report.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{estimation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{economic return}} to education has <b>perhaps</b> been <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> predominant areas <b>of</b> analysis in applied economics for over 50 years. In this short note we consider some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recent directions {{taken by the}} literature, and also some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blockages faced by both science and policymakers in pushing forward some key issues.

25|$|Monarchs {{share the}} defense of noxious taste with the similar-appearing viceroy {{butterfly}} in what is <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most well-known examples of mimicry. Though long purported to {{be an example of}} Batesian mimicry, the viceroy is actually reportedly more unpalatable than the monarch, making this a case of Müllerian mimicry.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther articulated a doctrine of the two kingdoms. According to James Madison, <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important modern proponents of {{the separation of church and}} state, Luther's doctrine of the two kingdoms marked {{the beginning}} of the modern conception of separation of church and state.|$|E
40|$|How has a four-century {{old church}} managed {{to stand on}} its feet, {{resisting}} more than 15 earthquakes of magnitude over 7 ?

40|$|This {{painting}} {{seems to}} represent <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tibetan religious reformers, <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> Pindolabharadvaja, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chief apostles <b>of</b> Buddhism. He is bare-headed {{and has a}} thin mustache. He is seated on a lotus throne with both hands in Dharma-chakra-mudra (sign of preaching or instruction). On each side is a standing figure. Other figures are: Yamantaka?, Tara?, etc...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> cartoon-like nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> piece carried {{political}} and social overtones. Grosz drew what is essentially a sketch, alluding to <b>the</b> primitive nature <b>of</b> conscription. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surrounding soldiers are drawn in the composite view, again suggesting <b>the</b> overt superficialness <b>of</b> war and society. <b>The</b> simplicity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line drawing “contributes to the directness and immediacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work, which scathingly portrays the German Army.”2 The cartoon gains credibility by including a tone of malicious humor, despite the traumatic and horrible subject matter, and it also establishes the viewer as a passive observer, <b>perhaps</b> as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German soldiers.|$|R
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first parodies from Doctor Who was a song {{released}} the first Christmas after The Daleks was initially broadcast. The British Go-Go's Christmas novelty single {{tried to turn}} the sinister Daleks into another version of The Chipmunks, and was originally released {{as one of the}} many products fueling Dalekmania.|$|E
25|$|The smaller {{northern}} prayer hall {{dates to}} {{the first phase of}} construction. It contained a total of 16 bays supported by nine pillars, which were originally carved from coral but later replaced by timber. The structure was entirely roofed, and was <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first mosques in the area to have been built without a courtyard.|$|E
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{statistically}} significant contributors to a lasting peace {{is whether or}} not military victory was achieved by one side. According to Fortna's research, civil wars in which one side wins, resulting in a cease-fire or truce, have an approximately 85%-90% lower chance of renewed war. Moreover, peace treaties further reduce the risk by 60%-70%.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Bursting Pulsar, GRO J 1744 − 28, {{has been}} {{observed}} with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) regularly since <b>the</b> launch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> satellite in December 1995 [1]. This accretion driven pulsar has undergone two outbursts which have been accompanied by significant spin-up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pulsar. Between these two outbursts, the pulsar was detectable during each observation down to fluxes <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> thousandth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> persistent flux at <b>the</b> peak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first outburst.

50|$|The Last Frontier {{appeared}} in film under its alternative title <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Secret Ways in an April 1961 release directed by Phil Karlson. Reynolds was played by Richard Widmark. The movie was filmed in Zurich and Vienna. It was <b>the</b> first <b>of</b> MacLean's works {{to appear as}} a movie, as <b>The</b> Guns <b>of</b> Navarone was not released until June 1961. According to an interview with Euan Lloyd in Cinema Retro magazine, producer and star Widmark had disagreements with Karlson, who felt he should use a tongue-in-cheek approach for <b>the</b> story. <b>Perhaps</b> because <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> screenwriters was Widmark's wife, Jean Hazelwood, Widmark took over directing the film.|$|R
