The periderm thus consists of three different layers: ...|$|E
50|$|Often a {{secondary}} covering called the periderm forms on small woody stems and many non-woody plants, which {{is composed of}} cork (phellem), the cork cambium (<b>phellogen),</b> and the phelloderm. The periderm forms from the <b>phellogen</b> {{which serves as a}} lateral meristem. The periderm replaces the epidermis, and acts as a protective covering like the epidermis. Mature phellem cells have suberin in their walls to protect the stem from desiccation and pathogen attack. Older phellem cells are dead, {{as is the case with}} woody stems. The skin on the potato tuber (which is an underground stem) constitutes the cork of the periderm.|$|E
50|$|What is {{commonly}} called bark includes {{a number of}} different tissues. Cork is an external, secondary tissue that is impermeable to water and gases, and is also called the phellem. The cork is produced by the cork cambium which is a layer of meristematically active cells which serve as a lateral meristem for the periderm. The cork cambium, which is also called the <b>phellogen,</b> is normally only one cell layer thick and it divides periclinally to the outside producing cork. The phelloderm, which is not always present in all barks, is a layer of cells formed by and interior to the cork cambium. Together, the phellem (cork), <b>phellogen</b> (cork cambium) and phelloderm constitute the periderm.|$|E
50|$|Condensed tannin, {{which are}} in fairly high {{concentration}} in bark tissue, is thought to inhibit decomposition. It {{could be due to}} this factor that the degradation of lignin is far less pronounced in bark tissue than it is in wood.

50|$|Aloe comosa is {{considered}} a tree aloe having a single, unbranched stem which may attain heights of approximately 3 meters. As it matures and grows in height, Aloe comosa retains its dry, dead leaves and forms a tangled skirt or beard. Tree aloe bark differs from woody dicot bark in that it doesn’t have a <b>phellogen,</b> which is the meristematic tissue that differentiates into the bark. In essence, aloe bark is actually overlapping, irregular layers of incomplete bark tissues.|$|E
50|$|The {{workers who}} {{specialize}} in removing the cork are known as extractors. An extractor uses a very sharp axe to make two types of cuts on the tree: one horizontal cut around the plant, called a crown or necklace, at a height of about 2-3 times the circumference of the tree, and several vertical cuts called rulers or openings. This is the most delicate phase of the work because, even though cutting the cork requires significant force, the extractor must not damage the underlying <b>phellogen</b> or the tree will be harmed. To free the cork from the tree, the extractor pushes {{the handle of the}} axe into the rulers. A good extractor needs to use a firm but precise touch in order to free a large amount of cork without damaging the product or tree.|$|E

50|$|Dioon edule {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from other Dioon species because it lacks spines on {{the borders of}} leaflets. Spines are present on juvenile leaves, however, they are lost when the plant matures. D. edule has a crown of pinnate (i.e. feathered) leaves which measure around 135 cm long. Lateral budding is present and mucilage, or sap, is excreted from any cut surfaces on the plant body. The plant has a large central medulla and a single vascular bundle containing the xylem, phloem and cambium. Since the organism is slow-growing and xerophilous (i.e. drought-tolerant), only a small conduction channel is needed, unlike other plants. Stomata are also present to aid in transpiration and assimilation and are associated with sporophylls. D. edule has three or four large adventitious (i.e. abnormally positioned) roots surrounded by many smaller ones which harbor small nodules containing tannins. Roots are composed of large amounts of corky secondary tissue consisting of <b>phellogen.</b> It is often very difficult distinguish males and females until they develop a cone. Cones generally do not show a visual difference; however, cone intervals {{can be used to}} determine the sex of the plant.

40|$|Cork oak (Quercus suber) is a long-living {{species of}} the Fagaceae family that highly {{contributes}} for the economy of several countries such as Portugal. It is the only plant species with a <b>phellogen</b> capable of a sustainable production of cork with properties suited for industry applications. <b>Phellogen,</b> or cork cambium, usually initiates in the subepidermis and differentiates {{during the first year}} of growth [1]. Its meristematic activity gives rise to phellem (cork) cells to the outside and to phelloderm to the inside. It is likely that genes involved in the regulation of other plant meristems such as shoot apical meristem and vascular cambium are also involved in the regulation of <b>phellogen.</b> Based on its role in other meristems, and on specific expression patterns in poplar stems, we hypothesize that SHORT-ROOT (SHR), a transcription factor from the GRAS family, may be involved in the regulation of <b>phellogen.</b> This gene has been well described in the Arabidopsis root where it plays a key role in the radial patterning and in regulating the specification of the root stem cell niche [2 - 4]. Recently, its involvement in the root vascular system to control patterning processes [5] and in the control of proliferative cell division in developing leaves [6]has also been reported.

However, a deep knowledge of the cytosine methylation patterns disclosing the epigenetic variability of trees with different cork quality types is totally missing. This study investigates the hypothesis that variations in DNA methylation contribute to differences in cork cellular characteristics directly related to original or traumatic <b>phellogen</b> activity. We used MSAPs (Methylation Sensitive Amplified Polymorphism) to assess DNA methylation patterns of cork and leaf tissues of Q. suber adult trees growing in three cork oak stands. The relationship between the detected polymorphisms and the diversity of cork quality traits was explored by a marker-trait analysis focusing on the most relevant quality characteristics. Populations differed widely in cork quality, but only slightly in degree of epigenetic differentiation.

This evidence supports the potential role of cytosine methylation in the modulation of differential <b>phellogen</b> activity either involved in localized cell death or in pore production, resulting in different cork qualities. Although, the underlying basis of the methylation polymorphism of loci affecting cork quality traits remain unclear, the disclosure of markers statistically associated with cork quality strengthens the potential role of DNA methylation in the regulation of these traits, namely at the <b>phellogen</b> level...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{provides}} new insights {{on the role}} of the potato (Solanum tuberosum) suberin feruloyl transferase FHT in native and wound tissues, leading to conclusions about hitherto unknown properties of the <b>phellogen.</b> In agreement with the enzymatic role of FHT, it is shown that its transcriptional activation and protein accumulation are specific to tissues that undergo suberization such as the root boundary layers of the exodermis and the endodermis, along with the tuber periderm. Remarkably, FHT expression and protein accumulation within the periderm is restricted to the <b>phellogen</b> derivative cells with phellem identity. FHT levels in the periderm are at their peak near harvest during periderm maturation, with the <b>phellogen</b> becoming meristematically inactive and declining thereafter. However, periderm FHT levels remain high for several months after harvest, suggesting that the inactive <b>phellogen</b> retains the capacity to synthesize ferulate esters. Tissue wounding induces FHT expression and the protein accumulates from the first stages of the healing process onwards. FHT is up-regulated by abscisic acid and down-regulated by salicylic acid, emphasizing the complex regulation of suberin synthesis and wound healing.

40|$|Abstract: Cork oak (Quercus suber L.) {{is usually}} {{dominant}} in silvopastoral systems {{in many areas}} of Sicily, where the trees are debarked periodically for cork production. In spite of the importance of cork and cork oak stands in Sicilian forests and the potential economic scenarios, few research works have been carried out on these systems. Given the importance of cork thickness in cork quality evaluation, the main objective of this work is to study cork growth in cork oak productive stands spread on the north (Nebrodi Mountains) and south-east (Iblei Mountains) of Sicily. Image analysis techniques were used on cork surfaces of transverse sections of planks to measure cork rings. Dendrochronological analysis was applied to study annual fluctuation on rings growth in relation to various climate parameters in a cork cycle production. Results showed that rainfall, summer drought and temperature are determining factors in controlling cork growth. In siliceous areas of Nebrodi Mountains correlation between cork growth index and rainfall indicates that the rain period from May to September strongly influences <b>phellogen</b> activity. Temperature and water stress indices, on the other hand, show a negative correlation with cork growth. In clay and evolved soils of volcanic plateau of Iblei Mountains January precipitation shows a positive correlation with cork growth index.

40|$|Aim {{of study}} : To analyze {{the effect of}} health status on cork production, {{analyzing}} if this influence is uniform or is affected by site conditions. Area of study : Two Western Algerian cork tree forests have been studied: M’Sila located in the coastal plains under semiarid climate, and Zarieffet, located in the mountainous interior under sub-humid climate. Material and Methods : 40 trees were selected in each forest and classified according to their health status as healthy, weakened, or decaying. A sample of cork from each tree has been obtained to measure the key variables related to cork production. A two-way ANOVA was performed considering two factors: site and health status. Main results : Quercus suber L. productivity {{is affected by the}} vitality of trees in the same way in both sources, showing values between 5. 96 ± 7. 1 kg • m - 2 (coast, weakened trees) and 8. 13 ± 0. 45 kg • m - 2 (mountain, healthy trees). The health status also affects the number and area of pores, especially in the cork oak groves of the coast, where the coefficient of porosity ranges from 3. 79 ± 0. 84 % (healthy trees) to 8. 11 ± 1. 91 % (decaying trees). The variables where the site has presented a stronger effect are those related to the amount of cork produced by the <b>phellogen</b> (density -kg·l - 1, p< 0. 000 - and productivity -kg·m - 2, p= 0. 001 -), and pore density (1 ·cm - 2, p= 0. 001). Scrap thickness (mm) and porosity (%) show a smaller effect although still representative (p= 0. 041 and 0. 038 respectively). Porosity and pore density show interaction site*health status. They all have higher values in the mountain (Zarieffet) than in the coast (M’Sila). The effect of tree vitality on the formation of pores in the cork oak <b>phellogen</b> is lower in the mountain than in the coast.

40|$|During {{this period}} our focus was the {{comparative}} xylem {{anatomy of a}} resistant species, Muscadinia rotundifolia cv Cowart and a susceptible species, Vitis vinifera cv Chardonnay. When infected by Xylella fastidosa both species produced tyloses (parenchyma ingrowths into tracheary elements) and gums; M. rotundifolia tended to have fewer tyloses. The resistant species also had narrower vessels, but otherwise xylem anatomy was similar to V. vinifera. Fluorescently tagged beads were loaded into both species. Beads traveled through the stem xylem in both, but did not move into petioles in these experiments. Tyloses were first apparent 24 hours after pruning in both species and most vessels were blocked in both after eight days of pruning. This suggests that the mechanism to form tyloses in both species is similar, although the resistant species tended to show fewer tyloses in response to Xf.

Comparison of the spectra for both surfaces of the obliterated phloem specimens showed no significant differences whereas comparison of the spectra for the inner (phelloderm) and outer (phellem) surfaces of the periderm specimens were quite different. Relative to the spectrum for the outer periderm surface, the inner periderm surface had significantly greater signals for aliphatic and carbonyl functionalities. Spectral subtractions after solvent extractions {{were consistent with the}} removal of resinous and phenolic extractives. Results provide not only the first demonstration of the chemical functionalities of individual layer/surfaces in pine bark by FT-IR spectroscopy, but also new evidence suggesting moisture barrier properties for the phelloderm...|$|E
40|$|Plant growth {{regulators}} {{involved in}} cork formation In Europe, cork oak {{is the only}} tree species cultivated at large-scale and periodically harvested throughout the tree’s life for its bark (cork), suitable for industrial applications. The porosity and caliber {{are the two most}} important parameters to determine cork quality and, consequently, its economic value. In cork oak, the porosity and caliber of the cork vary along the trunk and branches of the tree. Plant growth regulators (hormones), such as auxin, are involved in the control of plant development, growth and response to stress conditions. The cork formation process involves cell division from the cork cambium (<b>phellogen)</b> and the differentiation of phellem (cork) cells which includes the deposition of suberin in the cell walls. Similarly to what has been documented for wood formation [1], it is expected that growth regulators have a crucial role in these tissues for regulation of cell division and differentiation, thus affecting the properties of cork. Project outline This work aims at the study of plant growth regulators and their signaling pathways involved in the cork formation process, focusing on auxin. The specific objectives are...|$|E
40|$|Colonisation of Notholithocarpus densiflorus (Hook. and Arn.) Rehder tissues by Phytophthora ramorum Werres, De Cock & Man in’t Veld is {{not well}} understood. The {{pathogen}} is able to colonise nearly all tissues of this host but {{it is unclear how}} a tree is ultimately killed. In this research, P. ramorum infected N. densiflorus bark tissues were examined using various microscopic techniques to better understand the role of bark infection in killing a tree. Host responses to infection were detected by histological methods in conjunction with examining P. ramorum colonisation. Results of this work indicate that the pathogen can colonise nearly all N. densiflorus bark tissues but that <b>phellogen</b> and parenchyma of the inner bark are the most frequently and densely colonised. Pathogen specific elicitin labelling of P. ramorum-infected N. densiflorus sprouts caused hyphal cell walls to fluoresce in plant tissues, allowing specific identification of hyphae. Findings of this research show that nearly all bark tissues are capable of being colonised, that this host responds to infection with callose deposition, tissue discoloration, and cell collapse; and that elicitins are present in cell walls of hyphae in infected bark tissues...|$|E
40|$|The {{origin and}} {{structure}} are described {{of the secondary}} protective tissue in the stem of Erythorxylum tortuosum Mart., a fire tolerant shrubby species common in Brazilian cerrado. The highly tortuous stems are covered with thick bark which is more developed {{at the base of}} the stem. After fire in the cerrado, rhytidome fragments of the burned stem flake off, revealing newly formed cork. The first periderm appears near of the terminal buds and is iniated by periclinal divisions in subepidermal cells giving rise to radial rows of cells. The first <b>phellogen</b> is discernible only after the differentiation of the several radial rows of cork cells. Other phellogens have their origin in successively deeper layers of the cortex. The sucessive periderms are discontinuous around the circumference. The collapsed cells with phenolic substances and the accumulated dead cells cause the formation of discontinuous blackish lines, which delimit the sucessive periderms in the rhytidome. The rhytidome contains large quantities of sclereids developed from cell wall thickening of cortex cells. The occurrence of periderm, in the young parts of the stem and of rhytidome in the older parts represents pyrophytic characteristics and may explain, in part, the fire tolerance of this species...|$|E
