This paper sets out to understand the role of blogs in supporting a dispersed community of preservice teachers through content analysis of their blogs and comments. A model of the educational affordances of blogs is proposed to examine how blogs can support self-expression, self-reflection, social interaction, and reflective dialogue {{on the part of}} student teachers. This paper revealed that the salient value of blogs centered on emotion-laden and social-oriented individual expressions and reflection.

While the scholarly literature has examined and discussed open peer review, no established definition of it exists, nor are there uniform implementations of open peer review processes. This article examines the literature discussing open peer review, identifies common open peer review definitions, and describes eight common characteristics of open peer review: signed review, disclosed review, editor-mediated review, transparent review, crowdsourced review, prepublication review, synchronous review, and post-publication review.

40|$|Accompanying the {{emergence}} of blog technology as a dominant online <b>publishing</b> <b>paradigm</b> is a growing interest in its educational benefits and applications. This study sets out to develop an empirically grounded framework for educational blogging {{in the context of}} teacher education. A working framework was first proposed that highlights four areas: self-expression, self-reflection, social interaction, and reflective dialogue. An exploratory study was then conducted to examine the framework by involving two groups of student teachers during their teaching practice. This study revealed that the salient values of blogs centered on emotionally charged and social-oriented individual expressions as well as self-reflection. The interactive functionality of blogs was used mostly for exchanging social support rather than reflective dialogue. A new dimension - blog-reading - has emerged through the investigation and been added to the original framework. The findings can contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the educational values of blogs and their meaningful applications as educational media. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Synaptic {{competition}} {{is a basic}} feature of developing neural connections. To shed light on its dependence on the activity pattern of competing inputs, we investigated in vivo rat motoneuronal firing during late embryonic and early neonatal life, when synapse elimination occurs in muscle. Electromyographic recordings with floating microelectrodes from tibialis anterior and soleus muscles revealed that action potentials of motoneurons belonging to the same pool have high temporal correlation. The very tight linkage, a few tens of milliseconds, corresponds to the narrow time windows of <b>published</b> <b>paradigms</b> of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. A striking change occurs, however, soon after birth when motoneuronal firing switches to the adult uncorrelated type. The switch precedes the onset of synapse elimination, whose time course was determined with confocal microscopy. Interestingly, the soleus muscle, whose motoneurons switch to desynchronized activity later {{than those of the}} tibialis anterior muscle, also exhibits delayed synapse elimination. Our findings support a developmental model in which synchronous activity first favors polyneuronal innervation, whereas an asynchronous one subsequently promotes synapse elimination...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND The {{scholarly}} <b>publishing</b> <b>paradigm</b> {{is evolving}} to embrace innovative open access publication models. While this environment fosters {{the creation of}} high-quality, peer-reviewed open access publications, it also provides opportunities for journals or publishers to engage in unprofessional or unethical practices. LITERATURE REVIEW Faculty take into account {{a number of factors}} in deciding where to publish, including whether or not a journal engages in ethical publishing practices. Librarians and scholars have attempted to address this issue in a number of ways, such as generating lists of ethical/unethical publishers and general guides. DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT In response to growing faculty concern in this area, the Grand Valley State University Libraries developed and evaluated a set of Open Access Journal Quality Indicators that support faculty in their effort to identify the characteristics of ethical and unethical open access publications. NEXT STEPS Liaison librarians have already begun using the Indicators as a catalyst in sparking conversation around open access publishing and scholarship. Going forward, the Libraries will continue to evaluate and gather feedback on the Indicators, taking into account emerging trends and practices...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{vision of}} the Semantic Web {{is to build a}} global Web of data that links {{different}} resources. To this end, {{the first step is to}} put data on the Web in the form that machines can naturally understand or convert to useful forms. This can be achieved through Linked Data technology, an emerging <b>publishing</b> <b>paradigm</b> in which not only documents, but also data are linked over the Web. The ultimate goal underpinning Linked Data is to enable different individuals and organisations to efficiently contribute and share data about different domains. Climate change impacts and/or energy scarcity are among the leading challenges that the international community currently faces. The domain of renewable energy (RE) is widely believed to be an innovative domain that can contribute significantly in overcoming these challenges. Consequently, the institutionalisation of policies/strategies that can potentially lead to the uptake of RE technologies by various organisations is now too common. Employing Linked Data paradigm in managing knowledge provides opportunities for disparate organisations and people to efficiently learn and share knowledge about RE technologies, hence potentiall...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} describing the use of Lotus Notes to automate the publishing process of a large subscription-based industry-research firm. The case is described and analyzed using a framework that builds on concepts used in designing physical product architectures. These concepts were applied by treating the document as an information product. The product and process platforms of both the traditional and Notes-based approaches to producing the product were compared. Notes, {{in addition to providing}} a new distribution channel, enabled the firm to move from a traditional document-based <b>publishing</b> <b>paradigm</b> to one more akin to an information refinery based on the storage and integration of modular information-units. That move had significant impact on the way in which documents were written, edited, and marketed. It was shown that digitizing documents by itself is not suficient to create a flexible platform from which multiple versions of a document may be derived. Rather, the entire structure of the document must be reconceived in terms of more primitive information-units which can be digitized, indexed, and linked for retrieval in a variety of ways. 1...|$|E
