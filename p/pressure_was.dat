50|$|Pitot <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> the <b>pressure</b> that <b>is</b> {{measured}} by a Pitot tube, an open-ended tube connected to a pressure-measuring device. For subsonic flow, pitot <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> equal to the stagnation pressure (or total pressure) of the flow, and hence the term pitot <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> often used interchangeably with these other terms. For supersonic flow, however, pitot <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> the stagnation <b>pressure</b> of the flow behind the normal shock ahead of the pitot tube. Pitot <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> named for Henri Pitot, French scientist.|$|R
50|$|Pulse <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> the {{difference}} between the systolic and diastolic <b>pressure</b> readings. It <b>is</b> measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). It represents the force that the heart generates each time it contracts. If resting blood <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> 120/80 mmHg, pulse <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> 40.|$|R
5000|$|The Bernoulli {{equation}} {{applicable to}} incompressible flow {{shows that the}} stagnation <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> equal to the dynamic pressure plus static <b>pressure.</b> Total <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> also equal to dynamic pressure plus static pressure so, in incompressible flows, stagnation <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> equal to total pressure. (In compressible flows, stagnation <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> also equal to total pressure providing the fluid entering the stagnation point is brought to rest isentropically.) ...|$|R
5|$|It {{was first}} {{suggested}} in the 18th century that intracranial pressure rather than skull damage {{was the cause of}} pathology after TBI.

5|$|The campaign's {{ultimate}} limitation was {{the poor}} formulation of military strategy. The types of targets selected from one operation {{to the next}} differed radically and no sustained <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> put on any one type of British target. The Luftwaffes strategy became increasingly aimless. Disputes among the OKL staff revolved more around tactics than strategy. This method condemned the offensive over Britain to failure before it had begun.|$|E
5|$|The metre-tonne-second {{system of}} units (MTS) {{was based on the}} metre, tonne and second – the unit of force was the sthène and the unit of <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> the pièze.

50|$|Therefore, {{when the}} volume <b>is</b> halved, the <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> doubled; {{and if the}} volume <b>is</b> doubled, the <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> halved.|$|R
50|$|The blood <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> {{recorded}} as two readings: a high systolic pressure, which occurs during the maximal contraction of the heart, {{and the lower}} diastolic or resting pressure. A normal blood <b>pressure</b> would <b>be</b> 120 being the systolic over 80, the diastolic. Usually the blood <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> read from the left arm unless there is some damage to the arm. The difference between the systolic and diastolic <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> called the pulse pressure. The measurement of these <b>pressures</b> <b>is</b> now usually done with an aneroid or electronic sphygmomanometer. The classic measurement device is a mercury sphygmomanometer, using a column of mercury measured off in millimeters. In the United States and UK, the common form is millimeters of mercury, whilst elsewhere SI units of <b>pressure</b> <b>are</b> used. There is no natural 'normal' value for blood pressure, but rather a range of values that on increasing are associated with increased risks. The guideline acceptable reading also takes into account other co-factors for disease. Therefore, elevated blood <b>pressure</b> (hypertension) <b>is</b> variously defined when the systolic number is persistently over 140-160 mmHg. Low blood <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> hypotension. Blood <b>pressures</b> <b>are</b> also taken at other portions of the extremities. These <b>pressures</b> <b>are</b> called segmental blood <b>pressures</b> and <b>are</b> used to evaluate blockage or arterial occlusion in a limb (see Ankle brachial pressure index).|$|R
5|$|The minimum central {{pressure}} of these storms is, {{for the most}} part, estimated from satellite imagery using the Dvorak technique.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave moving westward off the African coast on October 1, 2001 {{entered the}} tropical Atlantic. The wave's organization changed little until October 4 {{as it moved}} westward, when curved banding features began to increase. However, little improvement in the wave's organization occurred until October 6 after continuing to move westward for two days, when an area of low <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> identified by the National Hurricane Center. Afterward, the cloudiness became more concentrated, and the system organized into a tropical depression by noon on October 6, shortly after the first advisory from the NHC was issued at 11 a.m. AST.|$|E

30|$|Grouting <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> {{the driving}} force that causes slurry to diffuse into the rocks, and it {{obviously}} affects the grouting quality and performance.

5|$|Alex was {{the first}} Atlantic {{hurricane}} {{in the month of}} June since Hurricane Allison in 1995, and the strongest in terms of wind speed since Hurricane Alma in 1966. Its barometric pressure recording of 946 mbar (27.96inches) is the most intense from any Atlantic hurricane in June, although Hurricane Audrey in 1957 ties this intensity. Alex is thus tied for the most intense June Atlantic hurricane on record overall. However, as Audrey's <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> estimated, Audrey's actual pressure might be as low as 925 mbar.|$|E
5|$|As Delia {{neared the}} Texas coastline, it managed to intensify into a strong {{tropical}} storm with winds of 70mph (110km/h) and reconnaissance reported winds well {{in excess of}} hurricane-force in numerous squalls associated with the storm. The lowest <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> recorded at 986mbar (hPa; 29.11inHg). However, Delia was not classified a hurricane as it had not developed an eyewall around the center of circulation. Delia subsequently made its first landfall at Freeport, Texas late on September4. After executing a counterclockwise loop, the storm made its second landfall in Freeport on September5. After moving inland, the storm quickly weakened, becoming a depression on September6 before dissipating early the next day over northern Mexico.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} by the cabin rupture, the convective rush of air caused the flames to spread across the cabin, beginning the second phase. The third phase began {{when most of the}} oxygen was consumed and was replaced with atmospheric air, essentially quenching the fire, but causing high concentrations of carbon monoxide and heavy smoke to fill the cabin, and large amounts of soot to be deposited on surfaces as they cooled.|$|E

30|$|However, {{when the}} {{difference}} (skeleton pressure) between the overburden pressure and fluid pressure (pore <b>pressure,</b> formation <b>pressure)</b> <b>is</b> decreased, the elastic {{parameters of the}} skeleton decrease and their corresponding velocities are decreased as well.

5|$|By 9 April, the <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> {{decreasing}} on the New Zealand {{positions as}} the Germans shifted their offensive {{north to the}} area around Armentières. While {{the bulk of the}} New Zealand Division remained on the Somme and consolidated its defences, some of its artillery went to reinforce the British forces bearing the brunt of the renewed German attacks. Casualties for this period of the war were high; nearly 1,000 of the division's personnel were killed through March and April and almost 2,700 were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Nine days later, {{he checked}} into Methodist Hospital in Houston {{for a series}} of {{physical}} and psychological tests to determine the cause of his mysterious arm problems. An angiogram revealed an obstruction in the distal subclavian and axillary arteries of the right arm. Richard's blood pressure in his left arm was normal but <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> nearly absent in his right arm due to the completely obstructed artery. On July 25, however, the arteries in his neck were studied, and the doctors reached a conclusion that all was normal and no surgical treatment needed to be performed.|$|E
5|$|Older storms have {{incomplete}} pressure readings, {{since there}} were no satellite-based estimates; the only observations were taken by ships, land-based observations, or reconnaissance aircraft when available. Ava's minimum known <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> measured {{when it was a}} Category4 hurricane, for example. John and Gilma have incomplete pressures because the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, in general, did not publish pressure on systems in the central Pacific (140°W to the dateline) at the time. However, {{it should be noted that}} this list is not identical to the list of most intense Pacific hurricanes. The most intense known Category4 storm in the eastern Pacific was 2014's Odile. The lowest pressure of this storm was 918 millibars, lower than that of some Category 5's, such as Guillermo.|$|E
50|$|Blood <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> {{expressed}} by two measurements, the systolic and diastolic <b>pressures,</b> which <b>are</b> the maximum and minimum pressures, respectively. Normal blood <b>pressure</b> at rest <b>is</b> {{within the range}} of 100-140 millimeters mercury (mmHg) systolic and 60-90 mmHg diastolic. High blood <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> present if the resting blood <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> persistently at or above 140/90 mmHg for most adults. Different numbers apply to children. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring over a 24-hour period appears more accurate than office best blood pressure measurement.|$|R
25|$|Dynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> the {{kinetic energy}} per unit volume of a fluid particle.

50|$|If the <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> {{greater than}} vapor pressure, then the fluid is liquid, {{otherwise}} vapor.

5|$|On July15, the {{hurricane}} moved ashore near Matagorda Bay in Texas, with winds estimated around 105mph (165km/h), or a Category2 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. At landfall, the minimum barometric <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> estimated at 969mbar (28.61inHg). The hurricane's strong winds broke {{all of the}} boats from their moorings in the Matagorda harbor. Four ships were either lost or wrecked, and one schooner was washed ashore. The storm dissipated early on July16 after progressing further inland.|$|E
5|$|On May24, 1960, a {{possible}} area of low <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> identified {{to the west}} of Koror in the Republic of Palau. Tracking generally to the northwest, the system gradually developed. Despite only having winds around 30km/h (15mph), it was classified as a tropical depression early the next day and assigned the name Lucille by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). Around the same time, a second, less organized low pressure system developed off the west coast of Luzon, Philippines. That system remained almost stationary over the South China Sea as Lucille accelerated northwestward. Early on May27, the JTWC issued their final advisory on the depression as it approached the Philippines. After degenerating, the remnants of Lucille moved over the Visayas.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, a {{tropical}} depression formed {{off the coast}} of Central America. It moved west-northwest, passing southwest of the Revillagigedo Islands. It then turned north and then north-eastward. For some time, it was a hurricane, and it lost that intensity on or just before September 25. The tropical storm made landfall near San Pedro, California early on September 25 with winds of severe gale strength. It dissipated later that day. The strongest reported wind was of Force 11, reported by a ship, making this system a minimal hurricane. The lowest <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> reported by the same ship and was 28.67inHg (971mb).|$|E
