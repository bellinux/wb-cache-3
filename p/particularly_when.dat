5|$|Although {{no serious}} {{injuries}} arose from any short-pitched deliveries while a leg theory field was actually set, the tactic still led to considerable ill feeling {{between the two}} teams, <b>particularly</b> <b>when</b> Australian batsmen suffered actual injuries in separate incidents, which inflamed the watching crowds. The controversy eventually spilled into the diplomatic arena.|$|E
5|$|Cancer, <b>particularly</b> <b>when</b> metastatic (spread {{to other}} places in the body), is a {{recognised}} risk factor for thrombosis. A number of mechanisms have been proposed, such as activation of the coagulation system by cancer cells or secretion of procoagulant substances. Furthermore, particular cancer treatments (such as the use of central venous catheters for chemotherapy) may increase the risk of thrombosis further.|$|E

5|$|Ibrox {{has also}} hosted the Scotland {{national}} football team, <b>particularly</b> <b>when</b> the national stadium Hampden Park was redeveloped in the 1990s.

5|$|In a dogfight, <b>particularly</b> <b>when</b> attacking Allied {{aircraft}} in a Lufbery circle, Marseille would often favour dramatically reducing the throttle and even lowering the flaps {{to reduce speed}} and shorten his turn radius, rather than the standard procedure of using full throttle throughout.|$|E
5|$|It is {{believed}} that the Lānai hookbill inhabited montane dry forests on Lānai dominated by akoko (Euphorbia species) and ōpuhe (Urera glabra). The unique shape of the hookbill's bill, <b>particularly</b> <b>when</b> compared with the ōū's bill, and its apparent rarity suggested that the species was an extreme specialist and was therefore restricted to this habitat.|$|E

5|$|Netball {{has been}} {{featured}} at the Pacific Games, a multi-sport event with participation from 22 countries {{from around the}} South Pacific. The event is held every four years and has 12 required sports; the host country chooses the other four. Netball is not a required sport and has missed selection, <b>particularly</b> <b>when</b> former French or American territories host the games.|$|E
5|$|When landing, {{wind shear}} {{is also a}} hazard, <b>particularly</b> <b>when</b> the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind {{gradient}} on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.|$|E
5|$|According to writer Devin Grayson, {{the amount}} of {{creative}} freedom allowed by editors in the portrayal of LGBT characters depends upon how popular and established a character already is. Long-standing characters that would require a retcon to change their sexuality {{are less likely to}} be shown as LGBT than newer characters. When such changes to a character's continuity are made, fans are often disgruntled, <b>particularly</b> <b>when</b> sexuality is involved, and Alan Moore suggests that creating a new character is preferable.|$|E

5|$|As {{with most}} small birds, {{mortality}} {{in the first}} year of life is high, but adults aged three to four years are regularly recorded, and the record is more than seven years. Eggs, chicks and fledglings of this ground-nesting species are taken by stoats, weasels and crows such as the European magpie, and the adults are hunted by birds of prey, particularly the sparrowhawk. Small birds are also at the mercy of the weather, <b>particularly</b> <b>when</b> migrating, but also on the breeding and wintering grounds.|$|E
5|$|Australian ravens {{generally}} walk {{when moving}} {{around on the}} ground, though do hop when hurrying. They preen themselves frequently, <b>particularly</b> <b>when</b> roosting {{in the middle of}} the day. They also engage in allopreening, where birds will preen each other's head and neck. This takes place particularly in autumn, winter and spring, and is important in pair bonding. Either member may initiate it, generally by landing near the other bird, shuffling next to its mate, then bending its head forward and presenting its nape.|$|E
5|$|Because Jupiter {{is not a}} solid body, {{its upper}} {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. The rotation of Jupiter's polar atmosphere is about 5minutes longer {{than that of the}} equatorial atmosphere; three systems are used as frames of reference, <b>particularly</b> <b>when</b> graphing the motion of atmospheric features. System I applies from the latitudes 10°N to 10°S; its period is the planet's shortest, at 9h 50m 30.0s. System II applies at all latitudes north and south of these; its period is 9h 55m 40.6s. System III was first defined by radio astronomers, and corresponds to the rotation of the planet's magnetosphere; its period is Jupiter's official rotation.|$|E

5|$|Beef steak is graded for quality, {{with higher}} prices for higher quality. Generally, the higher the quality, the more tender the beef, the less time is needed for cooking, or the better the flavor. For example, beef fillet is the most tender and wagyu, such as Kobe beef from Japan, {{is known for its}} high quality and {{commands}} a high price. Steak can be cooked relatively quickly compared to other cuts of meat, <b>particularly</b> <b>when</b> cooked at very high temperatures, such as by broiling or grilling.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{prefer to}} eat seeds, tubers, corms, fruit, flowers and insects. They often feed in large flocks, <b>particularly</b> <b>when</b> ground-feeding. Cockatoos are monogamous and nest in tree hollows. Some {{cockatoo}} {{species have been}} adversely affected by habitat loss, particularly from a shortage of suitable nesting hollows after large mature trees are cleared; conversely, some species have adapted well to human changes and are considered agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|Divers {{may carry}} one {{cylinder}} or multiples, {{depending on the}} requirements of the dive. Where diving takes place in low risk areas, where the diver may safely make a free ascent, or where a buddy is available to provide an alternative air supply in an emergency, recreational divers usually carry only one cylinder. Where diving risks are higher, for example where the visibility is low or when recreational divers do deeper or decompression diving, and <b>particularly</b> <b>when</b> diving under an overhead, divers routinely carry more than one gas source.|$|E

5|$|Driving to the Emirates Stadium is {{strongly}} discouraged {{as there are}} strict matchday parking restrictions in operation around the stadium. An hour before kick-off to one hour after the final whistle there is a complete ban on vehicle movement {{on a number of}} the surrounding roads, except for Islington residents and businesses with a road closure access permit. The parking restrictions mean that the stadium is highly dependent on the Underground service, <b>particularly</b> <b>when</b> there is no overground service in operation. Industrial action forced Arsenal to reschedule the match for the following month.|$|E
5|$|Hemorrhage from a Rathke's cleft cyst, {{a remnant}} of Rathke's pouch that {{normally}} regresses after embryological development, may cause symptoms that are indistinguishable from pituitary apoplexy. Pituitary apoplexy is regarded by some as distinct from Sheehan's syndrome, where the pituitary undergoes infarction {{as a result of}} prolonged very low blood pressure, <b>particularly</b> <b>when</b> caused by bleeding after childbirth. This condition usually occurs {{in the absence of a}} tumor. Others regard Sheehan's syndrome as a form of pituitary apoplexy.|$|E
5|$|Higgins' song writing {{grew out}} of a desire to express her {{emotions}} when she was at school and her lyrics describe her feelings about her own life and relationships. The piano was the first instrument she learned to play, and she continues to use it as well as digital pianos including a Roland RD-300SX, RD-700 and KR-15. She also uses guitars extensively in her music <b>particularly</b> <b>when</b> touring, due to their portable nature and favours the Australian brand, Maton. On occasion she plays keytar, xylophone and melodica during performances.|$|E
