5|$|Globally, pelican <b>populations</b> <b>are</b> {{adversely}} affected by four main factors: declining supplies of fish through overfishing or water pollution, destruction of habitat, direct effects of human activity such as disturbance at nesting colonies, hunting and culling, entanglement in fishing lines and hooks, and lastly the presence of pollutants such as DDT and endrin. Most species' <b>populations</b> <b>are</b> more or less stable, although three are classified by the IUCN as being at risk. All species breed readily in zoos, which is potentially useful for conservation management.|$|E
5|$|However, {{since this}} initial skepticism, {{biologists}} {{have come to}} a consensus that declines in amphibian <b>populations</b> <b>are</b> a real and severe threat to biodiversity.

5|$|Earlier common {{throughout}} deciduous {{forests in}} India, four-horned antelopes are now found in low numbers.
