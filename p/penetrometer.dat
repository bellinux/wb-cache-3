Although the Casagrande test is widely used across North America, the fall cone test is much more prevalent in Europe due to being less dependent on the operator in determining the Liquid Limit.|$|E

25|$|The {{test method}} {{consists}} of pushing an instrumented cone, {{with the tip}} facing down, into the ground at a controlled rate (controlled between 1.5 -2.5cm/s accepted). The resolution of the CPT in delineating stratigraphic layers {{is related to the}} size of the cone tip, with typical cone tips having a cross-sectional area of either 10 or 15cm², corresponding to diameters of 3.6 and 4.4cm. A very early ultra-miniature 1 cm² subtraction <b>penetrometer</b> was developed and used on a US mobile ballistic missile launch system (MGM-134 Midgetman) soil/structure design program in 1984 at the Earth Technology Corporation of Long Beach, California.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after {{waking up}} {{on the morning of}} flight day six three and a half minutes early, they {{discussed}} with Mission Control in Houston the day's timeline of events. The second lunar excursion's primary objective was to visit Stone Mountain to climb up the slope of about 20 degrees to reach a cluster of five craters known as [...] "Cinco Craters." [...] After preparations for the day's moonwalk were completed, the astronauts climbed out of the Lunar Module. After departing the immediate landing site in the lunar rover, they arrived at the day's first destination, the Cinco Craters, [...] from the LM. At [...] above the valley floor, the pair were at the highest elevation above the LM of any Apollo mission. After marveling at the view (including South Ray) from the side of Stone Mountain, which Duke described as [...] "spectacular," [...] the astronauts gathered samples in the vicinity. After spending 54 minutes on the slope, they climbed aboard the lunar rover en route to the day's second stop, station five, a crater [...] across. There, they hoped to find Descartes material that had not been contaminated by ejecta from South Ray Crater, a large crater south of the landing site. The samples they collected there, although their origin is still not certain, are, according to geologist Don Wilhelms, [...] "a reasonable bet to be Descartes." [...] The next stop, station six, was a [...] blocky crater, where the astronauts believed they could sample the Cayley Formation as evidenced by the firmer soil found there. Bypassing station seven to save time, they arrived at station eight on the lower flank of Stone Mountain, where they sampled material on a ray from South Ray Crater for about an hour. There, they collected black and white breccias and smaller, crystalline rocks rich in plagioclase. At station nine, an area known as the [...] "Vacant Lot," [...] which was believed to be free of ejecta from South Ray, they spent about 40 minutes gathering samples. Twenty-five minutes after departing station nine, they arrived at the final stop of the day, halfway between the ALSEP site and the LM. There, they dug a double core and conducted several <b>penetrometer</b> tests along a line stretching [...] east of the ALSEP. At the request of Young and Duke, the moonwalk was extended by ten minutes. After returning to the LM to wrap up the second lunar excursion, they climbed back inside the landing craft's cabin, sealing and pressurizing the interior after 7 hours, 23 minutes, and 26 seconds of EVA time, breaking a record that had been set on Apollo 15. After eating a meal and proceeding with a debriefing on the day's activities with Mission Control, they reconfigured the LM cabin and prepared for the sleep period.|$|E
2500|$|During its 322 Earth days of operations, Lunokhod 1 {{traveled}} [...] {{and returned}} more than 20,000 TV images and 206 high-resolution panoramas.

40|$|An {{approximate}} {{solution for the}} effects of high strain rates, and gradual strength degradation, on the penetration resistance of <b>penetrometers</b> can be obtained by combining the strain-path method with the classical upper bound theorem. The stream path calculations require the integration of the material constitutive equation along the streamlines. Unless the geometry is simple so that the integration can be evaluated analytically, numerical procedures are required to backtrack streamlines. The strain at any location is calculated by finding the streamline that passes through the given point and integrating the strain rate along that streamline from its inlet boundary. Thus, the calculations can be complicated, and errors can be accumulated during the calculation procedure. This paper presents an efficient approach for evaluating cumulative strains around <b>penetrometers</b> without the need to backtrack individual streamlines. In this approach, the strain components are treated as field variables. The global solution is obtained using the streamline upwind Petrov–Galerkin method. The new method together with an Eulerian-based finite element formulation was used to study the cone penetration test and evaluate the effect of strain softening on the cone resistanc...|$|R
30|$|Further, in {{the high}} {{pressure}} region, the capillary pressure should be corrected for the effect of material compression, void collapse or both. Although, this correction, known as the ’blank’ correction tends to have {{little effect on the}} estimated permeability {{due to the fact that}} most of the permeability models use the low pressure region of the capillary pressure curve; it can lead to the deviation of the data from expected asymptotic trend (see for instance Webb 2001). The <b>penetrometers</b> used in this work were all calibrated with a set of ’blank’ runs made with plugs of varying sizes to give a blank corrected capillary pressure data.|$|R

Mission B would sequentially deploy (from an orbiter bus), four, nondestructing surface <b>penetrometers</b> carrying instrumentation to investigate soil density, composition and chemistry, subsurface water, and perhaps seismology.

2500|$|The cone {{penetration}} or cone <b>penetrometer</b> test (CPT) is {{a method}} {{used to determine the}} geotechnical engineering properties of soils and delineating soil stratigraphy. It was initially developed in the 1950s at the Dutch Laboratory for Soil Mechanics in Delft to investigate soft soils. Based on this history it has also been called the [...] "Dutch cone test". Today, the CPT {{is one of the most}} used and accepted soil methods for soil investigation worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|The Huygens probe used a <b>penetrometer</b> on landing to {{characterize}} the mechanical properties of the local regolith. The surface itself {{was reported to be}} a clay-like [...] "material which might have a thin crust followed by a region of relative uniform consistency." [...] Subsequent analysis of the data suggests that surface consistency readings were likely caused by Huygens displacing a large pebble as it landed, and that the surface is better described as a 'sand' made of ice grains. The images taken after the probe's landing show a flat plain covered in pebbles. The pebbles, which may be made of water ice, are somewhat rounded, which may indicate the action of fluids on them.|$|E
2500|$|The SSP {{contained}} {{a number of}} sensors designed to determine the physical properties of Titan's surface {{at the point of}} impact, whether the surface was solid or liquid. An acoustic sounder, activated during the last 100 meters of the descent, continuously determined the distance to the surface, measuring the rate of descent and the surface roughness (e.g., due to waves). The instrument was designed so that if the surface were liquid, the sounder would measure the speed of sound in the [...] "ocean" [...] and possibly also the subsurface structure (depth). During descent, measurements of the speed of sound gave information on atmospheric composition and temperature, and an accelerometer recorded the deceleration profile at impact, indicating the hardness and structure of the surface. A tilt sensor measured pendulum motion during the descent and was also designed to indicate the probe's attitude after landing and show any motion due to waves. If the surface had been liquid, other sensors would also have measured its density, temperature, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, electrical properties (permittivity and conductivity) and refractive index (using a critical angle refractometer). [...] A <b>penetrometer</b> instrument, that protruded 55mm past the bottom of the Huygens descent module, was used to create a <b>penetrometer</b> trace as Huygens landed on the surface by measuring the force exerted on the instrument by the surface as the instrument broke though the surface and was pushed down into the planet by the force of the probe landing itself. [...] The trace shows this force as a function of time over a period of about 400 ms. [...] The trace has an initial spike which suggests that the instrument hit one of the icy pebbles [...] on the surface photographed by the DISR camera.|$|E
40|$|The {{finite element}} {{analysis}} of dynamic penetration of soil deposits, by either free falling or propelled objects, {{is one of the}} most sophisticated and challenging problems in geomechanics. A robust numerical method is described here for dealing with such complex and difficult problems. The approach is based on the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method of analysis, whose main features and challenges are briefly described.

40|$|Investigating {{planetary}} bodies using <b>penetrometers</b> {{can provide}} {{detailed information about}} its history and evolution. An estimation of subsurface density and porosity {{can be made from}} the shape of the penetration curve. Using <b>penetrometers</b> mounted on planetary platforms could be challenging due to the uncertainty of the subsurface composition and since the maximum allowed force for penetration is the weight of the lander or rover on the surface. Estimation of penetration forces can provide a reliable constraint on the maximum reachable depth without endangering the whole mission. Therefore, knowledge of the required penetration force to specific depths can be helpful in designing the length and shape of the probe. Test probes covering the anticipated diameter (2. 5, 1. 9, 1. 2 and 0. 9 cm diameter) and tip angle (30 °, 60 °, 90 °and 120 °) were inserted mechanically into regolith analogs. The results showed that tip angle does not have a major effect, while probe diameter and density of the regolith are the most important parameters. Increasing probe diameter from 0. 9 to 1. 9 cm (i. e. a factor of 2) leads to an increase in penetration force from 200 to 1000 N (i. e. a factor of 5) at 20 cm depth. An increase in bulk density from 1550 to 1700 kg/m 3 leads to an increase in penetration force from 10 to 200 N at 20 cm depth. Square probes required less force than circular ones which can allow for easier design of lateral windows...|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} investigation of lower cost Mars missions which perform useful exploration objectives after the Viking/ 75 mission was conducted. As a study guideline, {{it was assumed}} that significant cost savings would be realized by utilizing Pioneer hardware currently being developed for a pair of 1978 Venus missions. This in turn led to the additional constraint of a 1979 launch with the Atlas/Centaur launch vehicle which has been designated for the Pioneer Venus missions. Two concepts, using an orbiter bus platform, were identified which have both good science potential and mission simplicity indicative of lower cost. These are: (1) an aeronomy/geology orbiter, and (2) a remote sensing orbiter with a number of deployable surface <b>penetrometers...</b>|$|R

30|$|Geotechnical site {{characterization}} plays {{vital role}} in selection of pavement layers such as surface course, base course, subbase and subgrade. For most of the highway projects, cone penetration test (CPT) and dynamic cone <b>penetrometers</b> (DCP) are extensively used worldwide. These tests provide continuous and uninterrupted stratigraphic data with the improved resolution along the depth of penetration. The data obtained from these tests are less disruptive {{as compared to the}} data obtained from drilling operations. The CPT and DCP data has got a strong theoretical acceptance [19]. Soil samples cannot be retrieved during the operation of these tests. Visual inspection to promote the soil classification of subgrade is the only drawback in these tests.

30|$|Mercury {{intrusion}} porosimetry (MIP) is {{a well-known}} technique used to measure pore size distribution in a porous material. The pore size distribution, pore surface area and pore volume in a cryogel samples was determined using the mercury porosimetry machine (Thermo Finnigan, Pascal 140 / 440) (Woerly et al. 1998; Lv et al. 2005). The samples were placed into <b>penetrometers</b> which are weighed {{in front of the}} experiment. The analysis is based on the principle that a non-wetting liquid (mercury) penetrates into the porous network only under pressure. To determine the porosity, it was assumed that the shape of the pores was cylindrical. The contact angle of mercury is 130 °, and the surface tension of mercury is 0.485  N m− 1. The pressure applied is inverse proportional to the inner width of the pore aperture.|$|R

The effect of the mechanical properties of the clay soil on the penetration characteristics is discussed and some of the predictions are compared with the results of laboratory experiments.

The numerical method is also adopted to examine the fundamental compaction behaviour of soils and the trends in predicted results are broadly compared with the results of physical experiments...|$|R
25|$|Full flow <b>penetrometers</b> (T-bar, ball, and plate) probes {{are used}} in {{extremely}} soft clay soils (such as sea-floor deposits) and are advanced {{in the same manner}} as the CPT. As their names imply, the T-bar is a cylindrical bar attached at right angles to the drill string forming what look likes a T, the ball is a large sphere, and the plate is flat circular plate. In soft clays, soil flows around the probe similar to a viscous fluid. The pressure due to overburden stress and pore water pressure is equal on all sides of the probes (unlike with CPT's), so no correction is necessary, reducing a source of error and increasing accuracy. Especially desired in soft soils due to the very low loads on the measuring sensors. Full flow probes can also be cycled up and down to measure remolded soil resistance. Ultimately the geotechnical professional can use the measured penetration resistance to estimate undrained and remolded shear strengths.|$|R

Key questions are where and how deep to drill? Planetary protection issues were stressed as an important consideration in the design of any drilling mission. Secondly, architectures for drilling missions were discussed, including an overview of most of the current drills in operation that would be applicable to drilling on Mars. Considerable emphasis was placed on remote operation and drilling automation technologies. Finally, alternatives to conventional drilling were discussed. These included underground moles, <b>penetrometers,</b> horizontal drilling, impactors, and access to the subsurface from subsurface cavities. Considerable discussion centered on the possible Mars drilling missions that could be performed in both the near and longer term.
