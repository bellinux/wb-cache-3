25|$|Correlation coefficient. The {{correlation}} coefficient (first conceived by Francis Galton) {{was defined as}} a <b>product-moment,</b> and its relationship with linear regression was studied.|$|E
25|$|If x and y are {{results of}} {{measurements}} that contain measurement error, the realistic limits on the correlation coefficient are not −1 to +1 but a smaller range. For {{the case of a}} linear model with a single independent variable, the coefficient of determination (R squared) is the square of r, Pearson's <b>product-moment</b> coefficient.|$|E
25|$|In case of {{a single}} regressor, fitted by least squares, R2 is {{the square of the}} Pearson <b>product-moment</b> {{correlation}} coefficient relating the regressor and the response variable. More generally, R2 is the square of the correlation between the constructed predictor and the response variable. With more than one regressor, the R2 can be referred to as the coefficient of multiple determination.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{field of}} {{statistics}} {{emerged in the}} late 19th and early 20th century in three stages. The first wave, {{at the turn of}} the century, was led by the work of Francis Galton and Karl Pearson, who transformed statistics into a rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis, not just in science, but in industry and politics as well. Galton's contributions included introducing the concepts of standard deviation, correlation, regression analysis and the application of these methods to the study of the variety of human characteristics – height, weight, eyelash length among others. Pearson developed the Pearson <b>product-moment</b> correlation coefficient, defined as a <b>product-moment,</b> the method of moments for the fitting of distributions to samples and the Pearson distribution, among many other things. Galton and Pearson founded Biometrika as the first journal of mathematical statistics and biostatistics (then called biometry), and the latter founded the world's first university statistics department at University College London.|$|E
25|$|Quantitative {{psychological}} research {{lends itself}} to the statistical testing of hypotheses. Although the field makes abundant use of randomized and controlled experiments in laboratory settings, such research can only assess a limited range of short-term phenomena. Thus, psychologists also rely on creative statistical methods to glean knowledge from clinical trials and population data. These include the Pearson <b>product–moment</b> correlation coefficient, the analysis of variance, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, structural equation modeling, and hierarchical linear modeling. The measurement and operationalization of important constructs {{is an essential part}} of these research designs.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to make statistical inferences without assuming a particular parametric family of probability distributions. In that case, one speaks of non-parametric statistics {{as opposed to the}} parametric statistics just described. For example, a test based on Spearman's rank correlation coefficient would be called non-parametric since the statistic is computed from the rank-order of the data disregarding their actual values (and thus regardless of the distribution they were sampled from), whereas those based on the Pearson <b>product-moment</b> correlation coefficient are parametric tests since it is computed directly from the data values and thus estimates the parameter known as the population correlation.|$|E
25|$|Rank {{correlation}} coefficients, such as Spearman's {{rank correlation}} coefficient and Kendall's rank correlation coefficient (τ) measure {{the extent to}} which, as one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase, without requiring that increase to be represented by a linear relationship. If, as the one variable increases, the other decreases, the rank correlation coefficients will be negative. It is common to regard these rank correlation coefficients as alternatives to Pearson's coefficient, used either {{to reduce the amount}} of calculation or to make the coefficient less sensitive to non-normality in distributions. However, this view has little mathematical basis, as rank correlation coefficients measure a different type of relationship than the Pearson <b>product-moment</b> correlation coefficient, and are best seen as measures of a different type of association, rather than as alternative measure of the population correlation coefficient.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{familiar}} measure of dependence between two quantities is the Pearson <b>product-moment</b> correlation coefficient, or [...] "Pearson's correlation coefficient", commonly called simply [...] "the correlation coefficient". It is obtained {{by dividing the}} covariance of the two variables by the product of their standard deviations. [...] Karl Pearson developed the coefficient from a similar but slightly different idea by Francis Galton.|$|E
2500|$|As we go {{from each}} pair to the next pair x increases, and so does y. This {{relationship}} is perfect, {{in the sense that}} an increase in x is always accompanied by an increase iny. This means that we have a perfect rank correlation, and both Spearman's and Kendall's correlation coefficients are 1, whereas in this example Pearson <b>product-moment</b> correlation coefficient is 0.7544, indicating that the points are far from lying on a straight line. In the same way if y always decreases when x increases, the rank correlation coefficients will be −1, while the Pearson <b>product-moment</b> correlation coefficient {{may or may not be}} close to −1, depending on how close the points are to a straight line. [...] Although in the extreme cases of perfect rank correlation the two coefficients are both equal (being both +1 or both −1), this is not generally the case, and so values of the two coefficients cannot meaningfully be compared. For example, for the three pairs (1,1) (2,3) (3,2) Spearman's coefficient is 1/2, while Kendall's coefficient is1/3.|$|E
2500|$|Internal consistency, which {{addresses}} the homogeneity {{of a single}} test form, may be assessed by correlating performance on two halves of a test, which is termed split-half reliability; {{the value of this}} Pearson <b>product-moment</b> correlation coefficient for two half-tests is adjusted with the Spearman–Brown prediction formula to correspond to the correlation between two full-length tests. [...] Perhaps the most commonly used index of reliability is Cronbach's α, which is equivalent to the mean of all possible split-half coefficients. [...] Other approaches include the intra-class correlation, which is the ratio of variance of measurements of a given target to the variance of all targets.|$|E
2500|$|The {{correlation}} matrix of n random variables X1, ..., X'n is the n×n matrix whose i,j entry is corr(X'i,X'j). [...] If {{the measures of}} correlation used are <b>product-moment</b> coefficients, the {{correlation matrix}} {{is the same as}} the covariance matrix of the standardized random variables [...] for [...] [...] This applies to both the matrix of population correlations (in which case ' is the population standard deviation), and to the matrix of sample correlations (in which case ' denotes the sample standard deviation). Consequently, each is necessarily a positive-semidefinite matrix. Moreover, the correlation matrix is strictly positive definite if no variable can have all its values exactly generated as a linear function of the values of the others.|$|E

5000|$|The tetrachoric {{correlation}} coefficient {{assumes that the}} variable underlying each dichotomous measure is normally distributed. The {{tetrachoric correlation}} coefficient provides [...] "a convenient measure of Pearson <b>product-moment</b> correlation when graduated measurements {{have been reduced to}} two categories." [...] The tetrachoric correlation {{should not be confused with}} the Pearson <b>product-moment</b> correlation coefficient computed by assigning, say, values 0 and 1 to represent the two levels of each variable (which is mathematically equivalent to the phi coefficient). An extension of the tetrachoric correlation to tables involving variables with more than two levels is the polychoric correlation coefficient.|$|E
50|$|The {{correlation}} between {{scores on the}} first test and the scores on the retest is used to estimate {{the reliability of the}} test using the Pearson <b>product-moment</b> correlation coefficient: see also item-total correlation.|$|E
50|$|The common {{measure of}} {{dependence}} between paired random variables is the Pearson <b>product-moment</b> correlation coefficient, while a common alternative summary statistic is Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. A value of zero for the distance correlation implies independence.|$|E
50|$|Normalized {{correlation}} {{is one of}} {{the methods}} used for template matching, a process used for finding incidences of a pattern or object within an image. It is also the 2-dimensional version of Pearson <b>product-moment</b> correlation coefficient.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{approach}} {{parallels the}} use of the Fisher transformation {{in the case of the}} Pearson <b>product-moment</b> correlation coefficient.

5000|$|Pearson <b>product-moment</b> {{correlation}} coefficient, {{also known}} as r, R, or Pearson's r, {{a measure of the}} strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables that is defined as the (sample) covariance of the variables divided by the product of their (sample) standard deviations.|$|E
50|$|The {{distance}} correlation {{is derived}} {{from a number of}} other quantities that are used in its specification, specifically: distance variance, distance standard deviation and distance covariance. These quantities take the same roles as the ordinary moments with corresponding names in the specification of the Pearson <b>product-moment</b> correlation coefficient.|$|E
50|$|Pearson <b>product-moment</b> {{correlation}} coefficient {{is an alternative}} method to normalize the count of common neighbors. This method compares the number of common neighbors with the expected value that count would take in a network where vertices are connected randomly. This quantity lies strictly {{in the range from}} -1 to 1.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} other {{numerical}} measures that quantify {{the extent of}} statistical dependence between pairs of observations. The most common {{of these is the}} Pearson <b>product-moment</b> correlation coefficient, which is a similar correlation method to Spearman's rank, that measures the “linear” relationships between the raw numbers rather than between their ranks.|$|E
50|$|While the Fisher {{transformation}} is mainly {{associated with the}} Pearson <b>product-moment</b> correlation coefficient for bivariate normal observations, {{it can also be}} applied to Spearman's rank correlation coefficient in more general cases. A similar result for the asymptotic distribution applies, but with a minor adjustment factor: see the latter article for details.|$|E
5000|$|Pearson's {{correlation}} coefficient is the covariance {{of the two}} variables divided by {{the product of the}}ir standard deviations. The form of the definition involves a [...] "product moment", that is, the mean (the first moment about the origin) of the product of the mean-adjusted random variables; hence the modifier <b>product-moment</b> in the name.|$|E
50|$|If x and y are {{results of}} {{measurements}} that contain measurement error, the realistic limits on the correlation coefficient are not −1 to +1 but a smaller range. For {{the case of a}} linear model with a single independent variable, the coefficient of determination (R squared) is the square of r, Pearson's <b>product-moment</b> coefficient.|$|E
50|$|Restriction of range, such as {{floor and}} ceiling effects or {{selection}} effects, reduce {{the power of}} the experiment, and increase the chance of a type II error. This is because correlations are attenuated (weakened) by reduced variability (see, for example, the equation for the Pearson <b>product-moment</b> correlation coefficient which uses score variance in its estimation).|$|E
5000|$|A {{quantity}} {{closely related}} to the covariance matrix is the correlation matrix, the matrix of Pearson <b>product-moment</b> correlation coefficients between each of the random variables in the random vector , which can be writtenwhere [...] is the matrix of the diagonal elements of [...] (i.e., a diagonal matrix of the variances of [...] for [...] ).|$|E
5000|$|The {{procedure}} adopted {{is a kind}} of randomization or permutation test. The {{correlation between}} the two sets of [...] distances is calculated, and this is both the measure of correlation reported and the test statistic on which the test is based. In principle, any correlation coefficient could be used, but normally the Pearson <b>product-moment</b> correlation coefficient is used.|$|E

5000|$|Mean-centering is {{unnecessary}} if performing a {{principal components analysis}} on a correlation matrix, as the data are already centered after calculating correlations. Correlations are derived from the cross-product of two standard scores (Z-scores) or statistical moments (hence the name: Pearson <b>Product-Moment</b> Correlation). Also see the article by Kromrey & Foster-Johnson (1998) on [...] "Mean-centering in Moderated Regression: Much Ado About Nothing".|$|E
