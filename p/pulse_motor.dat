40|$|Introduction: Excitotoxicity {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the pathogenesis of the preferential motor neuron death observed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) by transcranial magnetic stimulation has an inhibitory effect on corticospinal excitability (CSE). We characterized the neurophysiological changes induced by cTBS in ALS. Methods: The patients received 5 daily sessions of cTBS. CSE was assessed at baseline and after each session of cTBS. Results: The amplitude of a single <b>pulse</b> <b>motor</b> evoked potential was significantly decreased (34 %) over the days. The amplitude returned to baseline a week after the last session. The resting motor threshold increased significantly, whereas intracortical inhibition and facilitation did not change over the sessions. Conclusions: Daily cTBS has a cumulative depressing effect on CSE in patients with ALS. These results suggest that modulation of CSE in ALS is possible, but repetitive sessions are needed to maintain the effect. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E

Single and paired <b>pulse</b> <b>motor</b> evoked potentials (MEPs) from flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor carpi radialis (ECR) muscles were recorded at baseline (T 0), post rPMS (T 1), 30 min post (T 2), 1 h post (T 3) and 2 h post rPMS (T 4). Then, with fMRI, 25 Hz rPMS was compared to sham stimulation by utilizing a finger tapping activation paradigm. Changes in BOLD contrast were examined at baseline (PRE), post rPMS (POST 1) and 1 h post rPMS (POST 2). With TMS facilitation was observed in the target muscle (FCR) following 25 Hz rPMS: MEP recruitment curves were increased at T 1, T 2 and T 3, and intracortical facilitation was increased at T 1 and T 2.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a magnetically suspended linear <b>pulse</b> <b>motor</b> for a semiconductor wafer transfer robot {{in a vacuum}} chamber. The motor can drive a wafer transfer arm horizontally without mechanical contact. In {{the construction of the}} magnetic suspension system, four pairs of linear magnetic bearings for the lift control are used for the guidance control as well. This approach allows us to make the whole motor compact in size and light in weight. The tested motor consists of a double-sided stator and a transfer arm with a width of 50 mm and a total length of 700 mm. The arm, like a ladder in shape, is designed as the floating element with a tooth width of 4 mm (a tooth pitch of 8 mm). The mover mass is limited to about 1. 6 kg by adopting such an arm structure, and the ratio of thrust to mover mass reaches to 3. 2 N/kg under a broad air gap (1 mm) between the stator teeth and the mover teeth. The performance testing was carried out with a transfer distance less than 450 mm and a transfer speed less than 560 mm/s. The attitude of the arm was well controlled by the linear magnetic bearings with a combined use, and consequently the repeatability on the positioning of the arm reached to about 2 micron. In addition, the positioning accuracy was improved up to about 30 micron through a compensation of the 128 -step wave current which was used for the micro-step drive with a step increment of 62. 5 micron...|$|E
40|$|During {{the left}} {{ventricular}} bypass, {{it is important}} to keep the arterial and atrial pressures at a physiological level to maintain the circulation and at the same time to rest the failing heart (recovery of the failing heart). We have developed a microcomputer based control system for the left ventricular assist pump (LVAP). The control system regulates the arterial and atrial pressures at a physiological level by adjusting the cardiac output of the LVAP. The superior feature of the control system is that it has an indirect measuring system. The arterial and atrial pressures are observed from the careful analysis of pressure in the LVAP air chamber. The assist air pressure shows that the air pressure at the specific momentary points when a diaphragm begins to move reflects the pressure in proportion to the arterial or atrial pressure. The specific momentary points are monitored by an optical diaphragm position sensor when a diaphragm begins to move at a systolic or diastolic period of LVAP, and the pressures at those points are measured by means of a drive air pressure transducer. A microcomputer obtains the indirectly measured arterial and atrial pressures through the A/D converters. The control system regulates the cardiac output of LVAP by adjusting the driving conditions (driving pressure, vacuum pressure, ejection duration, and driving rate) according to the indirectly monitored parameters. The control system consists of an optical diaphragm position sensor, <b>pulse</b> <b>motor</b> driven pressure regulators, a drive air pressure transducer, and a microcomputer.

40|$|Gilles de la Tourette {{syndrome}} is a neuropsychiatric disorder in which cortical disinhibition {{has been proposed}} as a pathophysiological mechanism involved in the generation of tics. Tics are typically reduced during task performance and concentration. How this task-dependent reduction of motor symptoms is represented in the brain is not yet understood. The aim of the current research was to study motorcortical excitability at rest and during the preparation of a simple motor task. Transcranial magnetic stimulation {{was used to examine}} corticospinal excitability, short-interval intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation in a group of 11 patients with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome and age-matched healthy controls. Parameters of cortical excitability were evaluated at rest and at six points in time during the preparation of a simple finger movement. Patients with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome displayed significantly reduced short-interval intracortical inhibition at rest, while no differences were apparent for unconditioned motor evoked potential or intracortical facilitation. During the premovement phase, significant differences between groups were seen for single <b>pulse</b> <b>motor</b> evoked potential amplitudes and short-interval intracortical inhibition. Short-interval intracortical inhibition was reduced in the early phase of movement preparation (similar to rest) followed by a transition towards more inhibition. Subsequently modulation of short-interval intracortical inhibition was comparable to controls, while corticospinal recruitment was reduced in later phases of movement preparation. The present data support the hypothesis of motorcortical disinhibition in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome at rest. During performance of a motor task, patients start from an abnormally disinhibited level of short-interval intracortical inhibition early during movement preparation with subsequent modulation of inhibitory activity similar to healthy controls. We hypothesize that while at rest, abnormal subcortical inputs from aberrant striato-thalamic afferents target the motor cortex, during motor performance, motor cortical excitability most likely underlies top-down control from higher motor areas and prefrontal cortex, which override these abnormal subcortical inputs to guarantee adequate behavioural performance. status: publishe...|$|E
