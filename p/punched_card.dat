5|$|The silk industry, however, did {{not gain}} any benefit from {{innovations}} in spinning, as silk is naturally already a thread. Making silk, silver, and gold brocades {{is a very}} delicate and precise process, with each colour needing its own dedicated shuttle. In the 17th century and 18th centuries progress began {{to be made in}} the simplification and standardization of silk manufacture, with many advances following one after another. Bouchon and Falcon's <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> loom appeared in 1775, later improved on by Jacques de Vaucanson. Later, Joseph-Marie Jacquard improved on the designs of Falcon and Vaucanson, introducing the revolutionary Jacquard loom, which allowed a string of punched cards to be processed mechanically in the correct sequence. The punched cards of the Jacquard loom were a direct precursor to the modern computer, in that they gave a (limited) form of programmability. Punched cards themselves were carried over to computers, and were ubiquitous until their obsolescence in the 1970s. From 1801 embroidery became highly mechanized due to the effectiveness of the Jacquard loom. The mechanism behind the Jacquard loom even allowed complex designs to be mass-produced.|$|E

Eckert's publication of <b>Punched</b> <b>Card</b> Methods in Scientific Computation in 1940, described <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> techniques sufficiently advanced to solve some differential equations or perform multiplication and division using floating point representations, all on punched cards and unit record machines. Such machines were used during World War II for cryptographic statistical processing, {{as well as}} a vast number of administrative uses. The Astronomical Computing Bureau, Columbia University, performed astronomical calculations representing {{the state of the art}} in computing.|$|E

25|$|Hollerith {{initially}} {{did business}} {{under his own}} name, as The Hollerith Electric Tabulating System, specializing in <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> data processing equipment. He provided tabulators and other machines under contract for the Census Office, which used them for the 1890 census. The net effect of the many changes from the 1880 census: the larger population, the data items to be collected, the Census Bureau headcount, the scheduled publications, {{and the use of}} Hollerith's electromechanical tabulators, was to reduce the time required to process the census from eight years for the 1880 census to six years for the 1890 census.|$|E
25|$|Of course, it is {{possible}} to code more than two symbols in any given medium. For example, one might use respectively 0, 1, 2, and 3 volts to code a four-symbol alphabet on a wire, or holes of different sizes in a <b>punched</b> <b>card.</b> In practice, the tight constraints of high speed, small size, and low power combine to make noise a major factor. This makes it hard to distinguish between symbols when there are several possible symbols that could occur at a single site. Rather than attempting to distinguish between four voltages on one wire, digital designers have settled on two voltages per wire, high and low.|$|E

50|$|Programs {{were mostly}} still entered using <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> or paper tape. See {{computer}} programming in the <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> era. By the late 1960s, data storage devices and computer terminals became inexpensive enough that programs could {{be created by}} typing directly into the computers. Text editors were developed that allowed changes and corrections to be made much more easily than with <b>punched</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|R
25|$|Exacerbating the problem, common <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> {{character}} sets {{of the time}} were uppercase only and lacked other special characters. It {{was only in the}} late 1960s that the widespread adoption of the ASCII character set made both lower case and the underscore character _ universally available. Some languages, notably C, promptly adopted underscores as word separators, and identifiers such as end_of_file are still prevalent in C programs and libraries (as well as in later languages influenced by C, such as Perl and Python). However, some languages and programmers chose to avoid underscores—among other reasons to prevent confusing them with whitespace—and adopted camel case instead.|$|E
25|$|However, in 1955, {{the state}} doubled tolls to $1.80 round trip for cars and $4.00 {{or more for}} trucks {{in order to pay}} for repairs, new toll booths, and a new <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> system {{compatible}} with the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel. The toll plazas, which had numbered three - one for each bridge - were consolidated to two, one {{at the south end of}} the main bridge and one at the north end of the Nansemond River Bridge. Thus the Crittenden Bridge became free for local traffic. In addition, passenger vehicles and light trucks only had to pay at the first booth they reached; large trucks and buses had to pay twice. This meant that light vehicles crossing only the main bridge (for instance between Smithfield and Newport News) only had to pay southbound.|$|E
25|$|While {{working for}} the {{insurance}} company, Peel wrote programs for <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> entry for an IBM 1410 computer (which led to his entry in Who's Who noting him as a former computer programmer), and {{he got his first}} radio job, albeit unpaid, working for WRR (AM) in Dallas. There, he presented the second hour of the Monday night programme Kat's Karavan, which was primarily hosted by the American singer and radio personality Jim Lowe. Following this, and as Beatlemania hit the United States, Peel got a job with the Dallas radio station KLIF as the official Beatles correspondent on the strength of his connection to Liverpool. He later worked for KOMA in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, until 1965 when he moved to KMEN in San Bernardino, California, using the name John Ravencroft to present the breakfast show.|$|E

25|$|The Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer (Fall 1945) was a Turing complete, {{general-purpose}} computer that used 17,468 vacuum tubes {{to create the}} circuits. At its core, it {{was a series of}} Pascalines wired together. Its 40 units weighed 30 tons, occupied , and consumed $650 per hour (in 1940s currency) in electricity when idle. It had 20 base-10 accumulators. Programming the ENIAC took up to two months. Three function tables were on wheels and needed to be rolled to fixed function panels. Function tables were connected to function panels using heavy black cables. Each function table had 728 rotating knobs. Programming the ENIAC also involved setting some of the 3,000 switches. Debugging a program took a week. The ENIAC featured parallel operations. Different sets of accumulators could simultaneously work on different algorithms. It used <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> machines for input and output, and it was controlled with a clock signal. It ran for eight years, calculating hydrogen bomb parameters, predicting weather patterns, and producing firing tables to aim artillery guns.|$|E

40|$|Background: Multidrug <b>punch</b> <b>cards</b> are frame {{cards with}} 28 plastic {{cavities}} {{filled with a}} patient’s oral solid medication. They are used in primary care to facilitate medication management and to enhance adherence. Main criticism concerned handling difficulties and fading knowledge about medication of patients using them. This study aimed at exploring daily use, preferences and adherence of primary care patients using multidrug <b>punch</b> <b>cards.</b> Methods: Community pharmacies in Switzerland recruited primary care patients using multidrug <b>punch</b> <b>cards.</b> A mixed methods approach was applied with quantitative interviews performed by telephone and qualitative interviews face-to-face. Results: Of 149 eligible patients from 21 community pharmacies, 22 participated 2011 in the quantitative and 11 participated 2013 / 14 in the qualitative interview. Patients were very satisfied with the multidrug <b>punch</b> <b>cards</b> and stated increased medication safety. All considered adherence as very important. Self-reported adherence was 10 (median) on a visual analogue scale (0 = no intake, 10 = perfect adherence). The absence of package inserts and predefined handling difficulties e. g., tablets spiking at removal were not perceived as problems. Conclusions: Patients are satisfied with the multidrug <b>punch</b> <b>cards,</b> feel safe, mostly have no handling problems and adhere to their treatment. Trust in health-care professionals and patients’ experiences emerged as key variables for initiating multidrug <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> use and for medication adherence. This mixed methods study invalidates previous concerns about disadvantages of multidrug <b>punch</b> <b>cards.</b> Health-care professionals should actively recommend them for primary care patients with polypharmacy and poor adherence...|$|R
