Each of these types of <b>portals</b> is examined with examples being drawn from a range of Australian and international large corporate Internet sites. The uses of <b>portals</b> by large enterprises provided by other companies are discussed, including: the development and demise of collective procurement <b>portals</b> (corProcure, Cyberlynx, eSteel, MetalSite, and the like) and the slow development of supply chain management <b>portals.</b> A number of directions for further research are suggested, including: large enterprise plans for collective procurement <b>portals</b> in the late 1990 s, the potential of supply chain <b>portals</b> that are not dominated by a single buyer, and the potential for increased transparency in the supply chain by development of supply chain management <b>portals...</b>|$|R

40|$|Discussion of <b>portals</b> {{and their}} {{relevance}} to destination tourism {{is the main}} focus of this chapter. Traditional definitions of <b>portals</b> have focused on intraorganisational information sharing. Here a broader interorganisational view of <b>portals</b> is adopted. Information sharing beyond organisations via <b>portals</b> renders them a collaborative tool, which is of real benefit to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This applies equally to tourism destinations which are typified by many small and medium tourist enterprises (SMTEs) (Braun, 2002). In addition to the traditional view of <b>portals,</b> <b>portals</b> have a collaborative function, and this is considered along with the phenomenon of collaborative commerce (c-commerce). Here critical elements underpinning successful c-commerce adoption are identified and their application to tourism destinations via collaborative <b>portals</b> are explored. It is posited that the role of a champion, community, social identity, and collaborative behaviour are important to successful collaborative <b>portals</b> and so, to destination marketing...|$|R
5|$|<b>Portal</b> 2 is a first-person puzzle-platform {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Valve Corporation. It is the sequel to <b>Portal</b> (2007) and was released on April 19, 2011 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.

5|$|The {{symptoms}} {{produced by}} AVMs {{in the liver}} depend {{on the type of}} abnormal connection that they form between blood vessels. If the connection is between arteries and veins, a large amount of blood bypasses the body's organs, for which the heart compensates by increasing the cardiac output. Eventually congestive cardiac failure develops ("high-output cardiac failure"), with breathlessness and leg swelling among other problems. If the AVM creates a connection between the <b>portal</b> vein and the blood vessels of the liver, the result may be <b>portal</b> hypertension (increased <b>portal</b> vein pressure), in which collateral blood vessels form in the esophagus (esophageal varices), which may bleed violently; furthermore, the increased pressure may give rise to fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity (ascites). If the flow in the AVM is in the other direction, <b>portal</b> venous blood flows directly into the veins rather than running through the liver; this may lead to hepatic encephalopathy (confusion due to <b>portal</b> waste products irritating the brain). Rarely, the bile ducts are deprived of blood, leading to severe cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts). Liver AVMs are detectable in over 70% of people with HHT, but only 10% experience problems as a result.|$|E

40|$|Public <b>portals,</b> such as Web search engines, {{have been}} {{available}} {{for a number of}} years and corporate <b>portals</b> that facilitate access to enterprise information within a company, normally through the Web, {{have been available}} for the last few years. Such <b>portals</b> are made up of “channels ” of information and the purpose of these <b>portals</b> is to provide an interface that presents an organized view of the data to which the user has access, i. e., a straight forward means of access to this data.
