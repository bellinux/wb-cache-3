40|$|International audienceWe {{deal with}} the problem of {{providing}} incentives for the implementation of constrained optimal outcomes in a two-period economy with incomplete markets. Allowing both for <b>price</b> <b>observation,</b> price-manipulation and a minimal amount of coordination enables to recover (second-best) efficiency at equilibrium, therefore to do better than perfect competition. To make this point, we construct a feasible price-quantity mechanism for two-period economies. In the absence of monitoring between the first and the second period, one gets a full implementation of the (typically inefficient) GEI equilibria via Nash equilibria. By contrast, when actions are observed between the two periods, a large subset of feasible and individually rational allocations can be obtained as strategic equilibria. Furthermore, the correspondence of individually rational, second-best efficient outcomes is implemented via undominated Nash equilibria (NE) ...|$|E
30|$|One {{assumption}} of the theoretical model is that <b>price</b> <b>observations</b> could be uncorrelated. We check for serial correlation and calculate the autocorrelation function for the basket in each store–location pair. Not surprisingly, the autocorrelation between two consecutive days is fairly high; yet autocorrelations calculated with a 10 -day lag between <b>price</b> <b>observations</b> are {{not significantly different from}} zero. So when estimating search costs, we use <b>price</b> <b>observations</b> separated by 10  days.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} whether {{the performance of}} the Black-Scholes model to price stock index options is influenced by the general conditions of the financial markets. For this purpose we calculated the theoretical values of 5814 options (3366 put option <b>price</b> <b>observations</b> and 2448 call option <b>price</b> <b>observations)</b> under the Black-Scholes assumptions. We compared these theoretical values with the real market prices in order to put the degree of deviations in two different time windows built around the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers (September 15 th 2008) to the test. We find clear evidences to state that the Black-Scholes model performed differently in the period after Lehman Brothers than in the period before; therefore we are able to blame this event for our findings...|$|R

40|$|In {{commodity}} futures markets, {{contracts with}} various delivery dates trade simultaneously. Applied researchers typically discard {{the majority of}} the data and form a single time series by choosing only one <b>price</b> <b>observation</b> per day. This strategy precludes a full understanding of these markets and can induce complicated nonlinear dynamics in the data. In this paper, I introduce the partially overlapping time series (POTS) model to model jointly all traded contracts. The POTS model incorporates time-to-delivery, storability, seasonality and GARCH effects. I apply the POTS model to corn futures at the Chicago Board of Trade and the results uncover substantial inefficiency associated with delivery on corn futures. The results also support two theories of commodity pricing: the theory of storage and the Samuelson effect. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates a {{selection}} of methods disentangling contributions from price jumps to realized variance. Flat prices (consecutively sampled prices in calendar time with the same value) and no trading (no <b>price</b> <b>observation</b> at sampling points), both frequently occurring stylized facts in financial high-frequency datasets, can cause a considerable bias in each considered method. Hence, we propose an approach to robustify those methods {{so that they can}} provide undistorted statistical results based on intraday intervals not influenced by flat prices and no trading. The new approach is tested in realistic Monte Carlo experiments and shows to be extraordinary robust against varying levels of flat price and no trading bias. Additionally, we examine the new approach empirically with a dataset of electricity forward contracts traded on the Nord Pool Energy Exchange. We obtain coherent conclusions with respect to predefined qualitative indicators.

30|$|Price {{information}} is also {{obtained from the}} Bureau of Labor Statistics. Seasonally adjusted Urban Consumer Price Indices that were reported per calendar month have been used. As we need a separate price index for children’s goods, we use a U.S. city average by expenditure category and commodity and service group. This means {{that we do not}} take regional price variation into account. We compute a monthly CPI for child expenditures by averaging the available separate product CPIs and taking account of the weights that these products have in the total expenditures on children goods. Separate CPIs were available for all components of Q 2, except for baby furniture and school meals. As the quarterly IS interviews take place throughout all months of the year, our data set contains 120 monthly values of Q 2 ’s CPI. Because households report expenditures over the previous three months, we assign the CPI that pertains to the third month prior to the interview to the expenditures in a certain quarter. We take the average of these CPI’s to obtain an annual <b>price</b> <b>observation.</b> Cumulative inflation on our basket of child related goods has been 32.0 percent from January 1998 until January 2008, which amounts to a yearly average inflation rate of 2.8 percent.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new empirical approach {{to address the}} problem of trading time differences between markets in studies of financial contagion. In contrast to end-of-business-day data common to most contagion studies, we employ <b>price</b> <b>observations,</b> which are exactly aligned in time to correct for time-zone and end-of-business-day differences between markets. Additionally, we allow for time lags between <b>price</b> <b>observations</b> in order to test the assumption that the shock is not immediately transmitted from one market to the other. Our analysis of the financial turmoil surrounding the Asian crisis reveals that such corrections have an important bearing on the evidence for contagion, independent of the methodology employed. Using a correlation-based test, we find more contagion the faster we assume the shock to be transmitted.

40|$|Abstract Background National and {{international}} policy makers have been increasing {{their focus on}} developing strategies to enable poor countries achieve the millennium development goals. This requires information on the costs {{of different types of}} health interventions and the resources needed to scale them up, either singly or in combinations. Cost data also guides decisions about the most appropriate mix of interventions in different settings, in view of the increasing, but still limited, resources available to improve health. Many cost and cost-effectiveness studies include only the costs incurred at the point of delivery to beneficiaries, omitting those incurred at other levels of the system such as administration, media, training and overall management. The few studies that have measured them directly suggest that they can sometimes account for a substantial proportion of total costs, so that their omission can result in biased estimates of the resources needed to run a programme or the relative cost-effectiveness of different choices. However, prices of different inputs used in the production of health interventions can vary substantially within a country. Basing cost estimates on a single <b>price</b> <b>observation</b> runs the risk that the results are based on an outlier observation rather than the typical costs of the input. Methods We first explore the determinants of the observed variation in the prices of selected "non-traded" intermediate inputs to health programmes – printed matter and media advertising, and water and electricity – accounting for variation within and across countries. We then use the estimated relationship to impute average prices for countries where limited data are available with uncertainty intervals. Results Prices vary across countries with GDP per capita and a number of determinants of supply and demand. Media and printing were inelastic with respect to GDP per capita, with a positive correlation, while the utilities had a surprisingly negative relationship. All equations had relatively good fits with the data. Conclusion While the preferred option is to derive costs from a random sample of prices in each setting, this option is often not available to analysts. In this case, we suggest that the approach described in this paper could represent a better option than basing policy recommendations on results that are built {{on the basis of a}} single, or a few, price observations. </p...|$|E

40|$|Is the {{cross-sectional}} {{distribution of}} house prices {{close to a}} (log) normal distribution, as is often assumed in empirical studies on house price indexes? How does the distribution evolve over time? To address these questions, we investigate the cross-sectional distribution of house prices in the Greater Tokyo Area for the period 1986 to 2009. We find that size-adjusted house prices follow a lognormal distribution except {{for the period of}} the housing bubble and its collapse in Tokyo, for which the price distribution has a substantially heavier right tail than that of a lognormal distribution. In addition, we find that, during the bubble era, the sharp price movements were concentrated in particular areas, and this spatial heterogeneity {{is the source of the}} fat upper tail. These findings suggest that the shape of the size-adjusted price distribution, especially the shape of the tail part, may contain information useful for the detection of housing bubbles. Specifically, the presence of a bubble can be safely ruled out if recent <b>price</b> <b>observations</b> are found to follow a lognormal distribution. On the other hand, if there are many outliers, especially near the upper tail, this may indicate the presence of a bubble, since such <b>price</b> <b>observations</b> are unlikel...|$|R
