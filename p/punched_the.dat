5|$|Much like Week1 in Chicago {{five years}} back, in Week4 at Seattle, Johnson was {{involved}} in another controversial play. This time, late in the fourth quarter, Seahawks safety Kam Chancellor <b>punched</b> <b>the</b> ball out of Johnson's hands while {{he was trying to}} score a late go-ahead touchdown. Linebacker K. J. Wright then batted the ball out of the end zone for a touchback. The NFL later admitted the referees should have penalized Wright for illegal batting. The Seahawks won the game by a score of 1310.|$|E
5|$|In 1935–36, he {{continued}} as a fixture at outside-left, but scored fewer goals. {{one of which}} came as an equaliser against Lincoln City when the referee failed to notice that teammate Johnny Wigham <b>punched</b> <b>the</b> ball to him rather than playing it legitimately. All the same, three months into the season he was the team's top scorer with six. As in the previous season, Hartlepools played Halifax Town in the FA Cup, and again, they won after a replay; Bonass was involved in three of their four goals, two of which were scored when his shot was parried to another player. He finished the season with 13 goals, second only to Wigham, as Hartlepools finished eighth in the Third Division.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{has said he}} was regularly beaten up in high school, {{and by the time}} he left for college he was determined never to be a victim again. As such, on the first day of his freshman year he walked into class and <b>punched</b> <b>the</b> first person he saw (unfortunately, this happened to be his ethics professor). He attended Dartmouth College (instead of his first pick, Hogwarts, claiming that his white owl led them to reject him), and was a member of the ΣΑΕ fraternity, although his acceptance into the college appears to have been largely influenced by a claimed familial relationship with a wealthy donor, and graduated in the top 47 percent of his class with a major in history. He has also referred to Bob Jones University as an alma mater.|$|E

5|$|Kahn {{was sent}} off in an {{incident}} against Hansa Rostock on 3 March 2001. With his Bayern Munich team losing 2–3 {{in the final}} minutes, he sneaked into the area during a corner kick, jumped up, and <b>punched</b> <b>the</b> ball into the opponent’s net. He immediately received a red card, which dismissed him from the game. He was named man of the match when {{he was part of}} the squad which played the 2001 Champions League title against Valencia. He played an important role in the penalty shoot-out held after the teams remained tied 1–1 after extra time, making three saves. He also received the UEFA Fair Play Award for this match, after he walked up to a disappointed Santiago Cañizares, the opposition goalkeeper, after the penalty shoot-out and attempted to comfort him. The same year, Bayern Munich won the International Cup at Tokyo's National Stadium against the Argentine team Boca Juniors. But the team failed to win the UEFA Super Cup a couple of months earlier.|$|E
5|$|The Bears' opening drive {{ended at}} Cleveland's 14-yard line when Cutler had his pass tipped in the endzone by T. J. Ward and intercepted by Tashaun Gipson. The Browns then scored on Billy Cundiff's 35-yard field goal, which was tied by Robbie Gould kicking a 23-yarder. Eventually, the Bears reached the Browns' 24-yard line on another drive, {{and after a}} penalty on Alshon Jeffery forced the Bears to kick a 46-yard field goal, the score was nullified by Corey Wootton's holding penalty, forcing Chicago to punt. With 8:01 in the first half, Cutler was again intercepted by Gipson, who {{returned}} the pick 44 {{yards for a touchdown}} and the 10–3 lead. With 24 seconds remaining in the half, Cutler connected on a 5-yard touchdown pass with Marshall to close the half at 10–10. Cutler ended the first half with 13 of 19 passes completed for 168 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions. Early in the third quarter, Jason Campbell's pass for Greg Little was intercepted by Zack Bowman and returned 43 yards for the score. Cleveland's Edwin Baker eventually scored his first career NFL touchdown on a 2-yard run, and the Browns added to the score when Billy Winn <b>punched</b> <b>the</b> ball from Martellus Bennett, and Ward returned the fumble 52 yards for the 24–17 advantage. Eventually, Cutler guided the Bears from their own 5-yard line, culminating in a 45-yard touchdown pass to Jeffery after Gipson made an ill-timed leap and Julian Posey being unable to interrupt the play with 10:59 remaining. With 5:41 left in the game, Cutler threw a 5-yard pass to Earl Bennett to take the 31–24 lead, which was extended by Michael Bush on a 40-yard touchdown run. Cutler's touchdown pass to Bennett was the twenty-ninth passing touchdown of the season, which ties the team record set in 1947 and 1995. With 1:03 to go, Campbell threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Josh Gordon, but the Bears recovered the ensuing onside kick to seal the victory, 38–31. The win marked the third time since 1970 that the Bears won all four games against an AFC division, and the first since 1986.|$|E

25|$|On early Sunday, March 11, 2012, {{two days}} before his trade to the Bears, Marshall was accused of hitting {{a woman in the}} face at a New York club and being {{involved}} in a melee.

25|$|On 13 July, in the FIFA World Cup Final against Argentina, Neuer was not heavily tested but he {{nonetheless}} commanded his penalty area well, challenging attacking runs by Gonzalo Higuaín and Rodrigo Palacio {{that caused}} them to shoot wide of the net (ending up Argentina finished without a shot on goal despite several good chances). Early in the second half, Neuer <b>punched</b> <b>the</b> ball clear before colliding with Higuaín {{at the edge of}} the box. Germany ultimately defeated Argentina 1–0 thanks to a Mario Götze goal in extra time. Neuer won the Golden Glove award for the tournament's best goalkeeper.|$|E
25|$|Near {{the end of}} {{the third}} period, Sid Abel scored for the Red Wings to narrow the Maple Leafs' lead to 3–1. However, a melee erupted when Abel and Maple Leafs' Gus Marker engaged one another. Within an instant, every player on the ice engaged an {{opponent}} in a fight, with players from both benches going over the boards to join them. The brawl lasted for more than 10 minutes with the last two engaged players being Jimmy Orlando and Horner. When peace was restored, the referee assessed majors and misconducts to Gus Marker and Abel, a major to Orlando, and a misconduct to Horner, who left the penalty box to join the altercation. At the games conclusion, Red Wings' coach Jack Adams had his own altercation. As the Red Wings headed towards their own dressing room, a fan attempted to assault Adams before he <b>punched</b> <b>the</b> fan himself.|$|E
25|$|In April 2010, {{with the}} hopes {{of being part of}} a golden era at the Wildcats, Redhage re-signed with the team on a three-year deal. However, on 23 January 2011, his season came to an end after dislocating his hip during the Wildcats' 77–76 loss to the Adelaide 36ers in Adelaide. It was {{originally}} feared that it could be a career-ending injury with there being a real possibility at the time of him requiring a hip replacement. The injury occurred after Redhage lunged for a contested ball in a way that <b>punched</b> <b>the</b> head of his femur through his pelvis, breaking the bone and dislocating the joint. For the first time since joining the Wildcats in 2005, Redhage was injured and out of action. The Wildcats lost four consecutive games after their skipper was whisked to the US for surgery, winning only two from the remaining eight. Despite missing {{the second half of the}} season, Redhage shared the Gordon Ellis Medal with Kevin Lisch for 2010/11.|$|E

25|$|Florida {{entered the}} 2012 matchup with their arch-rivals holding a 7–0 {{record and a}} No. 2 ranking while Georgia came in 6–1 and ranked No. 12, making the contest a key game {{in the race for}} the SEC East title. Both teams {{featured}} had strong defenses and ball control offenses, so the contest was unsurprisingly low scoring. Florida was down 17–9 late in the 4th quarter when they mounted a potential game-tying drive deep into Georgia territory. Gator quarterback Jeff Driskel completed a pass over the middle to tight end Jordan Reed, who appeared to be heading to the endzone before Bulldog outside line-backer Jarvis Jones <b>punched</b> <b>the</b> ball out of his hands, and Georgia recovered in the back of the endzone for a touchback. The lost fumble was Florida's sixth turnover of the game and allowed Georgia to hold on for the win. The teams finished the regular season tied for first in the SEC East with identical 7–1 records in conference play, but by virtue of their head-to-head victory over the Gators the Bulldogs advanced to the SEC Championship game, losing to eventual BCS national champion Alabama.|$|E
25|$|In {{the opening}} race in South Africa, Senna {{finished}} {{in second place}} after surviving a collision with Schumacher. Senna won in changing conditions in Brazil and Donington. The latter has often been {{regarded as one of}} Senna's greatest victories, in the process setting a record for the fastest lap in an F1 race driving through the then speed-unrestricted pit lane. He was fifth at the first corner and led the race {{at the end of the}} first lap going on to lap all but second place in a race where up to seven pit stops were required by some drivers for rain or slick tyres. Senna then scored a second-place finish in Spain and a record-breaking sixth win at Monaco. After Monaco, the sixth race of the season, Senna unexpectedly led the championship from Prost in the Williams-Renault. As the season progressed, Alain Prost and Damon Hill asserted the superiority of their Williams-Renault cars, while Senna suffered mechanical failures in Imola, Canada, Britain, Hungary, and Portugal. Senna won the penultimate race of the season in Japan, which was marked by an incident involving Jordan's rookie Eddie Irvine, twice unlapping himself against Senna. Immediately after the race, Senna attended at Jordan's garage and, following a lengthy and heated discussion, <b>punched</b> <b>the</b> Irishman in the face.|$|E
25|$|Virginia Tech's Logan Thomas fumbled on {{the first}} play from {{scrimmage}} when he was sacked by Sylvester Williams. This set up UNC with a 3 play, 20 yard drive that concluded with a Giovani Bernard 4 yard touchdown. After preventing Virginia Tech from converting a 4th down on the UNC 26 yard line, the Heels drove {{the length of the}} field to the 5 yard line where Ryan Houston fumbled the ball and it was recovered by the Hokies. The last time that UNC and Virginia Tech played on Thursday night was in 2009 when Virginia Tech fumbled the ball on a drive in the fourth quarter that eventually lead to a UNC victory. After coming 5 yards from taking a 14-0 lead, UNC found itself giving up 24 unanswered points to the Hokies by the fourth quarter. However, with 7:06 left in the game, Bryn Renner completed a pass to Erik Highsmith to reduce the lead to 10 points. After forcing the Hokies to punt on their next possession, Renner completed a 25 yard pass to Dwight Jones, then a 64 yard pass to Erik Highsmith to the 2 yard line where Houston <b>punched</b> <b>the</b> ball into the endzone to cut the lead to 3 with 2:32 left in the game. The Heels recovered the onside kick on the subsequent kick-off, but upon further review, it was judged that the ball did not travel the required 10 yards on the kickoff which gave the Hokies the ball. They were able to run the clock down to where only one play would be left for UNC, who was not able to convert it into a touchdown.|$|E
