A 52-kilowatt (70hp) Panhard et Levassor four-cylinder engine running at 1,000rpm, mounted centrally in the gondola, drove two 2.6-metre (8.5ft) diameter, two-bladed steel propellers that were mounted on cantilever arms, one on each side, rotating at 1,000–1,200rpm in opposite directions to prevent torque forces from twisting the airship. The exhaust pipe, below {{the rear of the}} gondola, was covered with metal gauze and pointed downwards to minimise the fire risk. The fuel tank, with a capacity in excess of 280L (61.6gal), was housed below the gondola within a pyramid of steel tubing that was designed to protect the gondola and the propellers during landing.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pilot</b> <b>operated</b> surge {{relief valves}} are {{typically}} {{used to protect}} pipelines that move low viscosity products like gasoline or diesel. This style of valve is installed downstream of the pump/valve that creates the surge. The valve is controlled by an external, normally closed pilot valve. The pilot will be set to the desired set point of the system, with a sense line that runs up stream of the valve. When the upstream process conditions start to exceed the pilot set point, the valve begins to open and relieve the excess pressure until the correct pressure is met causing the valve to close.|$|E

5000|$|The Villiers XXIV first flew in March 1928 and {{was soon}} {{undergoing}} tests at the military testing ground at Villacoublay, flown by Descamps. The slats were particularly closely examined. Fully loaded, the lowest flying speed was 101 km/h with slats shut, reduced to 70 km/h with them open. A planned second machine was intended to have automatic, aerodynamically opened slats {{in place of the}} <b>pilot</b> <b>operated</b> ones on the first prototype. [...] However, the CAN2 programme was dropped by the air force and development of the Villiers XXIV abandoned, so this second prototype was never built.|$|E
5000|$|Like other {{pressure}} relief valves (PRV), <b>pilot</b> <b>operated</b> relief valves (PORV) are used for emergency relief during overpressure events (e.g., a tank gets too hot and the expanding fluid increases the pressure to dangerous levels). The difference between PORV and conventional PRV is that pilot valves use system pressure to seal the valve. A PRV typically uses a spring to hold the disc or piston on seat. The essential parts of a PORV are a pilot valve (or control pilot), a main valve, a pilot tube, the dome, a disc or piston, and a seat. The volume above the piston is called the dome.|$|E
50|$|ADS {{consists}} {{in the case}} of Boiling water reactors of a series of valves which open to vent steam several feet under the surface of a large pool of liquid water (known as the wetwell or torus) in pressure suppression type containments, or directly into the primary containment structure in other types of containments, such as large-dry or ice-condenser containments. The actuation of these valves depressurizes the reactor vessel and allows lower pressure coolant injection systems to function, which have very large capacities in comparison to high pressure systems. Some depressurization systems are automatic in function but can be inhibited, some are manual and operators may activate if necessary. In Pressurized water reactors with large dry or ice condenser containments, the valves of the system are called <b>Pilot</b> <b>operated</b> release valves.|$|E

50|$|After {{achieving}} a lunar parking orbit, the Commander and LM Pilot entered and powered up the LM, replaced the hatches and docking equipment, unfolded and locked its landing legs, and {{separated from the}} CSM, flying independently. The Commander operated the flight controls and engine throttle, while the Lunar Module <b>Pilot</b> <b>operated</b> other spacecraft systems and kept the Commander informed on systems status and navigational information. After visual inspection of the landing gear by the Command Module Pilot, the LM was withdrawn to a safe distance, then the descent engine was pointed forward into the direction of travel to perform the 30 second Descent Orbit Insertion burn to reduce speed and drop the LM's perilune to within approximately 50000 ft of the surface, about 260 nmi km uprange of the landing site.|$|E

5000|$|Because {{the upper}} wing tilted, {{it had to}} be a {{cantilever}} structure. It was built around two wooden spars and was mounted at its centre on a chordwise circular cross-section rod, fixed to the fuselage, which acted as a hinge and allowed the wing to see-saw. When the Jona J-6 appeared at the Milan show in 1935, the year before its first flight, this hinge was held above the fuselage on a faired column, but before it flew this was replaced by four pairs of faired V-form struts with their eight ends fixed to it. [...] Control wires from the ailerons were attached to the fixed hinge rod, providing the required automatic deflections as the wing tilted. The rate of tilt was limited by a pair of telescopic, sprung struts from mid-chord quite close to the centreline, which met at the bottom centre of the fuselage after passing in through the upper sides. These could be hydraulically locked for aerobatics and spins or when stabilisation was not wanted. Leading edge automatic Handley Page slots were fitted to prevent spinning via wingtip stalling. The wing was plywood-covered and straight-tapered in plan form, with semi-elliptical tips. The lower wing was generally similar, though much smaller and rigidly mounted. Though not required when the automatic lateral control system was engaged, conventional, <b>pilot</b> <b>operated</b> ailerons were later added to the lower wing.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the ground}} a vapor lock {{condition}} in the fuel lines {{is merely an}} inconvenience however, in the air it becomes an emergency situation due to the difficulty in restarting the engine. Therefore, {{it is important that}} operators of reciprocating fuel injected engines switch fuel tanks prior to fuel exhaustion and to know and understand the hot start engine starting procedure. Most <b>pilot</b> <b>operating</b> handbooks for aircraft with reciprocating fuel injected engines describe specific procedures for starting the engine(s) after a recent shutdown while the engine is still [...] "hot" [...] in an attempt to avoid a vapor lock condition in the fuel feed lines or injector lines and enable a successful engine restart. Not all <b>pilot</b> <b>operating</b> handbooks use the hot start terminology to describe this procedure. As well, most <b>pilot</b> <b>operating</b> handbooks for aircraft susceptible to a vapor lock condition have a procedure for addressing vapor lock or [...] "rough engine" [...] if encountered in flight.|$|R
