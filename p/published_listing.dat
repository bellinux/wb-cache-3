The work groups conducted a three-step process: first, each group conducted an extensive literature review of their diagnoses; then, they requested data from researchers, conducting analyses to determine which criteria required change, with instructions to be conservative; finally, they conducted multicenter field trials relating diagnoses to clinical practice. A major change from previous versions was {{the inclusion of a}} clinical significance criterion to almost half of all the categories, which required that symptoms cause [...] "clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning".

The observable component is a G-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of G0V Fe-0.8 CH-0.5, indicating abnormal deficiencies in iron and the CH molecule. The surface magnetic activity for this star is distinctly lower than the typical level for regular stars, and hence it is considered {{a good candidate for}} being in a Maunder minimum phase.|$|E

Francis was sued repeatedly in Brazilian courts for libel, to no avail. In early 1996, he was attacked bitterly by the anthropologist and then senator Darcy Ribeiro, who, reacting to Francis' disparaging comments on a bill he had presented on the restructuring of Brazil's education system, called him a neogringo and charged him with lobbying for private universities' interests. In Ribeiro's words, Francis was well {{aware of the fact that}} what he offered as [...] "news" [...] was actually a task on behalf of interest groups. Late this year, an entire book was <b>published</b> <b>listing</b> and describing various cases of his supposed plagiarisms and abuses.|$|E
50|$|Trevor's World of Sport {{began as}} a 2003 BBC {{television}} sitcom {{written and directed by}} Andy Hamilton and starring Neil Pearson as Trevor. Only one television series was made, and Hamilton felt mistreated by the BBC over the scheduling of the show. The first episode attracted an average of 3.4 million viewers, dropping to 2.9 million for the second and third episodes. The subsequent episodes were rescheduled from Friday evenings (just after the 9:00pm watershed) to Monday nights (after the 10:00pm news), despite the Radio Times issues having already been <b>published</b> <b>listing</b> the originally scheduled transmission dates. Hamilton went public with his displeasure over the show's scheduling and vowed never to work for BBC1 again, though he has since changed his mind. A radio version was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2004, with subsequent series in 2005 and 2007.|$|E

50|$|The Protestant Reformation of the 16th century {{swept away}} centuries of church tradition; the {{whitewashing}} of sacred images {{led to a}} backlash against saints associated with the church. Whilst not prohibiting them, the Book of Common Prayer contained no text for a dedication service, and with new church builds becoming fewer the practice became less well known. By the 18th century many churches had even forgotten their dedication entirely, {{so that when the}} first books were <b>published</b> <b>listing</b> church dedications in the early 18th century (e.g. Browne Willis) many of them had been lost; in a modern analysis of his results on the churches of Devon, around a third of the churches were listed as having unknown dedication, and a further 30% listed dedications that were incorrect, {{or at the very least}} differed from their medieval dedication. Worse still, having appeared in print, many took the dedications to be authoritative and some were thus subsequently adopted by the parish as the authentic dedication.|$|E

Smith failed to set the record straight; and her lack of documented Cherokee descent became [...] "something of an open secret" [...] until 2015.

5000|$|According to {{the actor}} Sir Donald Sinden, in his Sky Arts TV series Great West End Theatres, {{contrary}} to popular myth, Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth is not the unluckiest play as superstition likes to portray it. Exactly the opposite! The origin of the unfortunate moniker dates back to repertory theatre days when each town and village {{had at least one}} theatre to entertain the public. If a play was not doing well, it would invariably get 'pulled' and replaced with a sure-fire audience pleaser - Macbeth guaranteed full-houses. So when the weekly theatre newspaper, The Stage was <b>published,</b> <b>listing</b> what was on in each theatre in the country, it was instantly noticed what shows had NOT worked the previous week, as they had been replaced by a definite crowd-pleaser.

5000|$|Gérard Souzay's first {{recordings}} {{were made}} in 1944 with the sopranos Germaine Lubin and Geneviève Touraine. (These were almost his only recorded duets, apart from some later ones with Elly Ameling.) He made other recordings in the 1940s for the small French company Boîte à Musique, and then {{signed a contract with}} English Decca. He subsequently recorded for Philips and EMI. A discography of his recordings has been <b>published,</b> <b>listing</b> over 750 titles [...] He participated in complete recordings of the songs of Fauré and Poulenc. On three occasions he won the prestigious Grand Prix du Disque, including one for his recording of the songs of Ravel. Later in his career, he sought to disown his early recordings and to veto the radio from broadcasting them, preferring his later versions of some of the same works. Much to the relief of admirers of the smooth and beautiful quality of his younger voice, he was not widely heeded, and many of his early recordings have been re-released to considerable acclaim.|$|E
5000|$|One {{hypothesis}} for {{the origin}} of this superstition is that Macbeth, being a popular play, was commonly put on by theatres in financial trouble, or that the high production costs of Macbeth put theatres in financial trouble, and hence an association was made between a production of Macbeth and theatres going out of business. According to the actor Sir Donald Sinden, in his Sky Arts TV series Great West End Theatres, [...] "Contrary to popular myth, Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth is not the unluckiest play as superstition likes to portray it.
