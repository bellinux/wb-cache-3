A modified Hausner Ratio was obtained by measurement of the poured and the compressed bulk densities.

Furthermore, the relation between ordered mixture composition and flowability was examined. Of the methods investigated, the modified Hausner Ratio discriminates well between the investigated powders and {{seems to have the}} widest measuring range. It was also found that the poured and compressed bulk densities provide information about the packing of the particles in the powders. A good correlation was obtained between the modified Hausner Ratio and the angle of repose. The AeroFlow was suitable for powders with a low percentage of fine particles, but could not discriminate between the more cohesive powders. The Uniaxial tester, on the other hand, seems to be better suited for more cohesive powders. Regarding the powder composition, addition of micronized particles has a strong influence on the flowability of ordered mixtures, while intermediate sized particles have little impact on the powder flow.

40|$|The major {{component}} of liquorice root extract, glycyrrhizinate (GZ), has been formulated as an injection {{for the treatment of}} hepatitis. If given orally, GZ has poor bioavailability and is catalysed to glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) by intestinal bacteria. GA is subsequently responsible for significant side effects. This study was conducted to clarify the relationship between GZ and GA absorption and bioavailability. GZ and GA absorption were investigated using the in situ single pass isolated perfused intestine (IPI). Hepatic disposition was investigated using isolated perfused liver (IPL) and in vivo biliary excretion models. The apparent permeability and absorption rate constants in the IPI for GZ were 0. 36 ± 0. 31 cm/ min and 0. 35 ± 0. 33 min- 1, while those for GA were 5. 73 ± 0. 11 cm/min and 1. 53 ± 0. 05 min - 1, re spectively. The hepatic extraction ratios of unbound GZ and GA in the IPL were 0. 22 ± 0. 01 and 0. 44 ± 0. 15, respectively. Seven hours after intraportal venous injection in vivo, the cumulative biliary excretion ratio for GZ was 96 %. There was negligible biliary excretion of unchanged GA during the same period. It was apparent in all models used that in the absence of intestinal bacteria GZ was not metabolised to GA, or vice versa. Hence, GZ can be absorbed unchanged from the intestine provided it has sufficient time and is protected from intestinal bacteria. This opens up the possibility that the use of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>carrier</b> systems or similar formulation approaches may allow effective oral administration of therapeutic levels of GZ without the side effects associated with GA. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG...|$|E
40|$|Success of {{treatments}} involving medications depends {{to a large}} extent on target specificity. Recent interest has been focused on developing nanoscale biodegradable vehicles capable of targeted delivering while minimizing toxic side effects by limiting wide spread distribution to non-targets. Lipid-based systems such as liposomes are one such approach, being biocompatible and widely accepted, has and having already reached US-FDA approval and clinical use. Liposomes have been further developed by incorporating ultrasound imaging gas to create bubble liposomes which can be used for ultrasound-guided tracking and bursting. The overall aim of this research was to develop lipid-based liposome and bubble liposomal delivery systems for an organic molecule, the traditional anticancer agent curcumin, and an inorganic vector, layered double hydroxide (LDH). Curcumin is a hydrophobic molecule. In order to enhance the solubility and delivery characteristics of curcumin, a hydrophilic form of it was prepared by complexing curcumin within β-cyclodextrin (βCD) using a methanol reflux method. Optimization of curcumin entrapment within βCD was achieved, and confirmed by measuring enhanced water solubility. Successful entrapment of both native hydrophobic curcumin and the hydrophilic βCD-curcumin complex into liposomes, prepared using a thin-film hydration approach, was achieved. All curcumin-containing formulations were effective in inhibiting cell proliferation in lung (A- 459) and colon (SW- 620) cancer cell lines, with median lethal dose (LC 50) being in the low µM range. Our research demonstrated that βCD inclusion complexes of poorly water soluble drugs, such as curcumin, can be entrapped within biocompatible vesicles such as liposomes, and this does not preclude their anticancer activity. The next step was to upgrade the liposome delivery system to bubble liposomes. Bubble liposomes were prepared by supercharging with perfluoropropane (PFP) gas using a conventional well-published method involving sonication, which we optimised to improve ultrasound imaging intensity and long term particle stability. Low nanometre sized particles (150 - 300 nm) were achieved but polydispersity fluctuated in the mid-high (0. 5 - 1) range and when stored at 2 - 8 °C these bubble liposomes decreased in size and lost ultrasound signal intensity due to leaching out of PFP gas. To improve bubble liposome size and stability we designed a novel approach involving supercharging using a ‘short burst’ method involving vortexing rather than sonication. Our approach delivered bubble liposomes of comparable low nanometre size to those prepared by reported methods, but with a more acceptable level of polydispersity (0. 2 - 0. 4). Stability was also improved; ultrasound imaging intensity was retained during storage at 2 - 8 °C for 7 days, paving the way for development of bubble liposomes into a <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>carrier</b> system. Previous studies have reported the use of bubble liposomes with ultrasound as successful cavitation-inducing agents which enhance the delivery of therapeutics that are co-administered. In this study we investigated the feasibility of preparing therapeutic-entrapped bubble liposomes instead of delivering them separately. Using a method based on sonication to add PFP to liposomes containing native curcumin produced very few bubbles as evidenced by their almost unchanged particle size and very weak ultrasound signal intensities. This was likely due to insufficient force generated by sonication to replace some preoccupied curcumin from lipid bilayers and allow PFP gas to form nanobubbles with the lipids. Bubble liposomes containing hydrophilic curcumin (βCD-curcumin complex) prepared by the same method indicated bubble formation but the formulations appeared to be unstable with particle size reducing dramatically after 24 hrs indicating PFP gas release. Preparation of bubble liposomes containing native curcumin using our vortexing approach caused larger particle sizes and strong ultrasound signal intensity, indicating PFP gas uptake, which remained unchanged when stored for 14 days at 2 - 8 °C. Bubble liposomes containing hydrophilic curcumin were also produced using our method, and importantly, these formulations appeared to be stable for at least 28 days of storage at 2 - 8 °C because particle size remained unchanged. Therefore, our optimized vortexing approach was efficient in formulating both hydrophobic and hydrophilic therapeutics into bubble liposomes. As a contrast to formulation of organic agents, we aimed to prepare liposomes containing the inorganic gene delivery vector, layered double hydroxide (LDH). The first step was to prepare small layered double hydroxides (sLDH) with sizes below 50 nm to allow entrapment into standard sized liposomes (c. 200 nm). Preparation of sLDH was optimised by investigating the precipitation, hydrothermal treatment, washing and dispersion conditions along with aging of the product at least for 6 days. Sonication was added to speed up the process, resulting in particles that were 20 nm in size. Indeed, these sLDH particles maintained their structural integrity, shape and size for at least 24 days at room temperature. Finally, these sLDH particles were entrapped into pegylated liposomes prepared by thin-film hydration, showing that entrapment into the liposomes is possible. Hence, delivering sLDH by entrapping into liposomes could form a novel organic-inorganic hybrid delivery vector. Overall, this research demonstrated that forming inclusion complex of poor water soluble drug with β-cyclodextrin and their subsequent up-gradation with a liposome-based formulation does not preclude their therapeutic activity. We have developed a novel approach to prepare consistent low nanometre sized bubble liposomes with acceptable polydispersity and good ultrasound signal intensity. In addition, this novel approach has also proved to be effective in formulating bubble liposomes containing either hydrophobic or hydrophilic therapeutics. Lastly, this research has paved the way of finding a solution to the bio-incompatibity of layered double hydroxides by forming a new liposome-based organic-inorganic hybrid delivery vector with sLDH...|$|E

40|$|Spray drying is a {{continuous}} operation that converts atomized liquid droplets into dry particles {{usually in a}} high temperature environment. The concept of spray drying was firstly reported over 150 years ago. Due to its scalable feeding capacity and simple mechanical device manipulation spray drying {{has become one of}} the most important powder manufacturing methods in both research laboratory and industry. The applications of spray drying technology has been expanded to an increasingly wide range, covering food, pharmaceutical, agrochemical, detergent, pigment, ceramic, chemicals, etc. In the last three decades significant amount of research and development has been conducted in the area of spray drying in order to handle various precursor materials, to obtain desirable product characteristics, and to reduce materials waste and energy cost. For particle engineering/science research, spray drying, compared to wet-chemistry process, avoids extensive conjugation or purification steps and offers a more efficient means for obtaining powders in one single step to complete encapsulation, complex formation and polymerization. In terms of product quality, there are always specific requirements on particle properties to realize optimal applications. For example, in drug delivery research, there exists desirable particle size range that is dependent on the targeted organs/cells and the routes of administration. For pharmaceutical controlled release applications, the uniformity of particle size and of morphology can be highly beneficial since wide distribution of particle size could lead to more undesirable ‘burst’ effects. For synthesizing functional inorganic products, e. g. photoluminescence, catalysis, and ceramic materials, non-agglomerated spherical particles are usually desirable to increase the packing density and to elevate PL yield or catalysis efficiency. In terms of spray drying kinetics and particle formation studies, the validation of various mathematical models can be facilitated by the narrow size distribution of droplets/particles. Conventional spray dryers, however, suffer from uneasy controllability on particle characteristics (e. g. particle size, size distribution, density, porosity, shape, morphology, moisture content, etc.) and functionalities (e. g. solubility, dispersibility, flowability, hygroscopicity, etc.). It is mostly ascribed to the size polydispersity of the atomized droplets and complicated air flow pattern making the droplets undergo different thermal-mass transfer histories and evaporation processes despite within the same dryer chamber. In addition, complex drop/particle travelling trajectories may result in unwanted particle agglomeration. In this thesis, a specially designed monodisperse droplet generator, referred as micro-fluidic-aerosol-nozzle (MFAN), is presented. Moreover, design and fabrication is introduced for a novel micro-fluidic-jet-spray-dryer equipped with MFAN as the atomizer, capable of synthesizing particles with uniform characteristics. Numerous trials using commercially available monodisperse droplet generators encountered several challenges, such as complicated operating procedures, limited ability to handle viscous liquid, vulnerability to blockage and low yield in droplet production, etc. Thus special designs of the MFAN have been motivated with a few improved features making it an excellent option as the spray dryer atomizer. A cost-efficient visualization means of using a digital SLR camera with a strobe and a micro-lens has been shown to be sufficiently effective to monitor the droplet generation process and to measure the droplet size. The MFAN operating mechanism has been investigated to construct an operability diagram for monodisperse droplet generation. It has been found that a wide frequency range is able to produce monodisperse droplets. The size of monodisperse droplet formed by the MFAN is ranged from 15 to 600 μm. A range of different materials have been tested using the MFJSD, such as functional food and <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>carrier</b> particles, ceramic and catalysis composites. The size of uniform particle can be made from 10 to 300 μm. Two experimental case studies using the MFJSD are introduced. Firstly, non-agglomerated and uniform microcomposites containing alpha-D-lactose monohydrate, silica nanoparticle, and Eu(III) have been synthesized by the MFJSD-II. The as-prepared particles have been characterized using the light microscope, field emission scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The impact of the precursor composition, ingredient concentration, and drying temperature profile on the particle size, morphology, structure, and element distribution in the composite matrix has been investigated. Distinct from the spherical lactose microparticles with smooth surface, both silica nanoparticle/lactose and Eu(III) /silica nanoparticle/lactose microcomposites are of a bowl-like shape with smooth top and wrinkled bottom. Two possible mechanisms induced by the presence of colloidal silica nanoparticles have been proposed for the formation of such composite structure. X-ray diffractometer and Fourier transform infrared spectra have been carried out to identify the physical state and surface chemistry of the particles. Transmission electron microscope images of the calcined spray-dried Eu(III) /silica nanoparticle/lactose microcomposites shows the homogeneous distribution of Eu 2 O 3 nanoparticles. Photoluminescence spectra indicate that high Eu(III) -doped concentration has led to the photoluminescence intensity enhancement, whereas spray drying temperature has shown little impact on the photoluminescence property. Secondly, uniform-sized vitamin B 12 -loaded silica microencapsulates have been synthesized via the MFJSD-I. Particle size and morphology have been characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscope. With similar initial droplet size and spray drying conditions, added of either alpha-D-lactose monohydrate or Na-alginate generally results in larger particle size. Furthermore, additive lactose facilitates the formation of spherical particles with relatively smooth surface, whereas the presence of Na-alginate renders the particles buckled with either smooth or rough surface, depending on additive amount. In vitro vitamin B 12 release and silica-matrix degradation profiles have shown significant dependence with the additive type and content. In general, lactose accelerates both of the drug release and matrix degradation, likely due to the relatively fast lactose dissolution facilitating the buffer penetration. On the contrary, Na-alginate appears to serve as an additional barrier decelerating the matrix degradation and prolonging the drug release. Increasing drug loading accelerates the drug release, especially in first few hours of the process, probably due to the drug enrichments near or on the particle surface increasing the driving force for mass transfer. However, the drug loading amount tested in this study has shown no obvious impact on the silica-matrix degradation rate. The drug release kinetics studies indicate the drug diffusion-dependant release mechanism regardless the additive type and amount...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to prepare and characterize PEGylated liposome of cantharidin and investigate its therapeutic effect on human hepatocellular carcinoma treatment in vitro and in vivo. Liposomal cantharidin was evaluated for their anticancer effects in vitro using human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG 2 cells and in vivo using HepG 2 -bearing nude mice compared to free drug. PEGylated liposome of cantharidin had a particle size of 129. 9 nm and a high encapsulation efficacy of approximately 88. 9 %. The liposomal cantharidin had a higher anti-proliferative effect vis-à-vis free cantharidin in inducing G 2 /M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Liposomal cantharidin killed more HepG 2 cancer cells at the same concentration equivalent to free cantharidin. Further study in vivo also showed that liposomal cantharidin achieved a higher tumor growth inhibition efficacy than free drug on hepatocellular carcinoma. As our study exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity against HepG 2 cells and augmented tumor inhibitory effects in vivo, the results validate the potential value of cantharidin-liposome in improving the therapeutic efficacy of cantharidin for liver cancer...|$|R
40|$|Liposomes are lipid vesicles largely {{investigated}} {{in the past}} 30 years as <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>carriers.</b> In {{the development of new}} liposome-based formulations, the study of liposome surface properties remains a crucial step. For this purpose, microscopy techniques can provide useful information, although each such technique suffers from some limitations. Here, we have used cold field emission gun-scanning electron microscopy (cFEG-SEM) to acquire detailed images of liposome surface. In particular, we observed PEGylated and non-PEGylated liposomes in different size ranges. In the case of nanosized liposomes (mean diameter about 200 nm), a morphological evaluation of the whole preparation was obtained. On the other hand, in the case of giant liposomes (mean diameter about 2 mum), it was possible to observe the different surface ultrastructures of the two formulations. In particular, a regular and only slightly wrinkled surface was observed in the case of non-PEGylated liposomes, while a very irregular surface ultrastructure was visible in the case of PEGylated liposomes. This study shows, for the first time, the potential of cFEG-SEM as a new and powerful tool to obtain information on liposome morphology and, at least in the case of giant liposomes, on ultrastructure of the liposome surface...|$|R
40|$|Lyophilisomes are a novel {{class of}} {{biodegradable}} proteinaceous nano/micrometer capsules with potential use as drug delivery carrier. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) including the TAT peptide {{have been successfully}} implemented for intracellular delivery of a broad variety of cargos including various nanoparticulate <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>carriers.</b> In the present study, lyophilisomes were modified using CPPs {{in order to achieve}} enhanced cellular uptake. Lyophilisomes were prepared by a freezing, annealing, and lyophilization method and a cystein-elongated TAT peptide was conjugated to the lyophilisomes using a heterobifunctional linker. Fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) was utilized to acquire a lyophilisome population with a particle diameter smaller than 1000 nm. Cultured HeLa, OVCAR- 3, Caco- 2 and SKOV- 3 cells were exposed to unmodified lyophilisomes and TAT-conjugated lyophilisomes and examined with FACS. HeLa cells were investigated in more detail using a trypan blue quenching assay, confocal microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. TAT-conjugation strongly increased binding and cellular uptake of lyophilisomes in a time-dependent manner in vitro, as assessed by FACS. These results were confirmed by confocal microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy indicated rapid cellular uptake of TAT-conjugated lyophilisomes via phagocytosis and/or macropinocytosis. In conclusion, TAT-peptides conjugated to albumin-based lyophilisomes are able to enhance cellular uptake of lyophilisomes in HeLa cells...|$|R
40|$|<b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>carriers</b> {{have been}} widely {{investigated}} in both laboratory and clinical settings to improve the efficiency of delivering therapeutic and diagnostic agents via different administration routes (1). Nano-drug delivery systems based on polymeric biomaterials have attracted considerable interest as drug delivery vehicles in recent decades (2). In this work new polyelectrolyte complex-based nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized and characterized starting from methacrylic acid (MAA) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The presence of PVP in the complex favors the interaction with nucleic acids and makes the nanoparticles able to elude the RES, thus increasing the circulation time (3). NPs were developed {{in the form of}} both nanospheres (NSs) and nanocapsules (NCs), an innovative kind of hollow nanoparticles with a great potential because of their low effective density and high specific surface area. Moreover, thanks to their internal cavity, NCs can maximize the amount of absorbed and released drug (4). Due to the fact that folic acid receptors exhibit limited expression on healthy cells but are often present in large number on cancer cells, NPs were functionalized using folic acid to obtained an active targeting towards cancer cells (5). Finally the ability of functionalized NPs to load and then release a nucleic acid was investigate...|$|R

Eradicating cancer stem cells by efficient targeting agents may {{have the potential to}} cure cancer. In this review, we summarize recent breakthroughs that have improved our understanding of cancer stem cells, and we discuss the therapeutic strategy of targeting cancer stem cells, a promising future direction for cancer stem cell research. Key words Cancer stem cells, targeting therapy, <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>carriers</b> Review Advances in medical investigation have fostered a deeper understanding of cancer, from tissue anatomy to molecular mechanisms of tumor initiation and development. However, there is no consensus on how cancers are initiated or how they develop from small neoplasms to fatal tumors. Based on experimental evidence, scientists have proposed that tumors may possess cells similar in phenotype to normal stem cells and that these cancer stem cells (CSCs) are the origin of tumors. At the end of the 20 th century, Canadian scientists identified a hierarchy in leukemia cells, a breakthrough that laid the foundation for CSC research and cast new light on cancer therapy. Here, we will summarize recent discoveries about CSCs and discuss how the cancer stem cell theory has impacted the potential for targeted therapy...|$|R

Lignocellulosic biomass is a complex biopolymer that is primary composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The presence of cellulose in biomass is able to depolymerise into nanodimension biomaterial, with exceptional mechanical properties for biocomposites, <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>carriers,</b> and electronic substrate’s application. However, the entangled biomass ultrastructure consists of inherent properties, such as strong lignin layers, low cellulose accessibility to chemicals, and high cellulose crystallinity, which inhibit the digestibility of the biomass for cellulose extraction. This situation offers both challenges and promises for the biomass biorefinery development to utilize the cellulose from lignocellulosic biomass. Thus, multistep biorefinery processes are necessary to ensure the deconstruction of noncellulosic content in lignocellulosic biomass, while maintaining cellulose product for further hydrolysis into nanocellulose material. In this review, we discuss the molecular structure basis for biomass recalcitrance, reengineering process of lignocellulosic biomass into nanocellulose via chemical, and novel catalytic approaches. Furthermore, review on catalyst design to overcome key barriers regarding the natural resistance of biomass will be presented herein. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in human therapy is to develop delivery systems that are convenient and effective for tackling problems in disease treatments. In the past 20 years, liposomes have represented promising <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>carriers</b> for drug delivery. Due to their biophysical properties, liposomes can deliver and specifically target a large set of bioactive molecules, they can protect molecules from degradation, and their composition is easily modifiable. The use of recombinant proteoliposomes containing therapeutic membrane proteins is a recently developed technology that allows biologically active proteins to penetrate across the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells. One of the bottlenecks in this powerful delivery system lies {{in the production of}} functional therapeutic membrane proteins mainly due to their biophysical characteristics. Membrane proteins represent about 30 % of the total proteins from an organism, and {{play a central role in}} drug discovery as potential pharmaceutical targets. This chapter describes the methodology for the production of bioactive proteoliposomes containing therapeutic, proapoptotic membrane proteins synthesized with an optimized cell-free expression system. We will examine (1) the design of the expression vectors and the liposome compositions compatible with the cell-free expression system; (2) the production of membrane proteins using a cell-free expression system in combination with liposomes, to obtain in a one-step reaction functional therapeutic proteoliposomes; (3) proteoliposome purification for further use in the treatment of cancer cells; and (4) the methodology for detecting apoptosis in cells after treatment. Furthermore, this system can be easily adapted for producing "difficult to express proteins" compared with the classical overexpression (bacterial or eukaryotic) systems...|$|R
40|$|To develop {{targeted}} <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>carriers</b> additionally {{capable of}} responding to certain local stimuli, such as decreased pH values in tumors or infarcts, targeted long-circulating PEGylated liposomes and PEG-phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE) -based micelles have been prepared with several functions. First, {{they are capable of}} targeting a specific cell or organ by attaching the monoclonal antimyosin antibody 2 G 4 to their surface via pNP-PEG-PE moieties. Second, these liposomes and micelles were additionally modified with biotin or TAT peptide (TATp) moieties attached {{to the surface of the}} nanocarrier by using biotin-PE or TATp-PE or TATp-short PEG-PE derivatives. PEG-PE used for liposome surface modification or for micelle preparation was made degradable by inserting the pH-sensitive hydrazone bond between PEG and PE (PEG-Hz-PE). Under normal pH values, biotin and TATp functions on the surface of nanocarriers were "shielded" by long protecting PEG chains (pH-degradable PEG(2000) -PE or PEG(5000) -PE) or by even longer pNP-PEG-PE moieties used to attach antibodies to the nanocarrier (non-pH-degradable PEG(3400) -PE or PEG(5000) -PE). At pH 7. 4 - 8. 0, both liposomes and micelles demonstrated high specific binding with 2 G 4 antibody substrate, myosin, but very limited binding on an avidin column (biotin-containing nanocarriers) or internalization by NIH/ 3 T 3 or U- 87 cells (TATp-containing nanocarriers). However, upon brief incubation (15 - 30 min) at lower pH values (pH 5. 0 - 6. 0), nanocarriers lost their protective PEG shell because of acidic hydrolysis of PEG-Hz-PE and acquired the ability to become strongly retained on an avidin column (biotin-containing nanocarriers) or effectively internalized by cells via TATp moieties (TATp-containing nanocarriers). We consider this result as the first step in the development of multifunctional stimuli-sensitive pharmaceutical nanocarriers...|$|R
