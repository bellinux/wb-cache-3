This study utilized a modified differential thermal analysis method, in which the combustion furnace temperature was the reference to which the sample temperature was compared. Based on the distribution of the maximum temperature differential and the sample heating rate, a self-heating probability value (SHPV) was calculated that corresponded to observed self-heating behavior.
