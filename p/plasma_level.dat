25|$|Benzodiazepines {{have been}} abused both orally and intravenously. Different benzodiazepines have {{different}} abuse potential; the more rapid {{the increase in the}} <b>plasma</b> <b>level</b> following ingestion, the greater the intoxicating effect and the more open to abuse the drug becomes. The speed of onset of action of a particular benzodiazepine correlates well with the ‘popularity’ of that drug for abuse. The two most common reasons for preference were that a benzodiazepine was ‘strong’ and that it gave a good ‘high’.|$|E
25|$|Reabsorption is the {{transport}} of molecules from this ultrafiltrate and into the peritubular capillary. It is accomplished via selective receptors on the luminal cell membrane. Water is 99% reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. Glucose at normal plasma levels is completely reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. The mechanism {{for this is the}} Na+/glucose cotransporter. A <b>plasma</b> <b>level</b> of 350mg/dL will fully saturate {{the transport}}ers and glucose will be lost in the urine. A plasma glucose level of approximately 160 is sufficient to allow glucosuria, which is an important clinical clue to diabetes mellitus.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: ischaemic renal {{dysfunction}} {{is present}} in many clinical settings, including cardiovascular surgery. Renal hypoperfusion {{seems to be the}} most important pathophysiologic mechanism. Arginine <b>plasma</b> <b>levels</b> are rate limiting for NO synthesis, and low arginine <b>plasma</b> <b>levels</b> are seen after major vascular surgery. Objective: to establish the effects of low arginine <b>plasma</b> <b>levels</b> on renal blood flow after renal ischaemia/reperfusion. Design: Wistar rats were used in this unilateral renal ischaemia/reperfusion model. After 70 min of ischaemia, the kidney was reperfused for 150 min. Arginase infusion was used to lower arginine <b>plasma</b> <b>levels.</b> Blood flow measurement was performed at the end of the experiment using radiolabelled microspheres. Additional experiments were performed for histopathology. Results: arginase efficiently decreased arginine <b>plasma</b> <b>levels</b> to about 50 % of normal. There was a lower blood flow in the ischaemic kidney than the contralateral (non-ischaemic) kidney. Lowering arginine <b>plasma</b> <b>levels</b> did not reduce renal blood flow in the ischaemic kidney. Renal histopathology was not influenced by lowered arginine <b>plasma</b> <b>levels.</b> Conclusions: lowering arginine <b>plasma</b> <b>levels</b> did not affect blood flow or histology following renal ischaemia and reperfusion...|$|R

25|$|Sibutramine is well absorbed {{from the}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract (77%), but undergoes considerable first-pass metabolism, reducing its bioavailability. The drug itself reaches its peak <b>plasma</b> <b>level</b> after 1 hour {{and has also}} a half-life of 1 hour. Sibutramine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP3A4 into two pharmacologically-active primary and secondary amines (called active metabolites 1 and 2) with half-lives of 14 and 16 hours, respectively. Peak plasma concentrations of active metabolites 1 and 2 are reached after three to four hours. The following metabolic pathway mainly results in two inactive conjugated and hydroxylated metabolites (called metabolites 5 and 6). Metabolites 5 and 6 are mainly excreted in the urine.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines {{are common}} drugs of abuse in Australia and New Zealand, {{particularly}} {{among those who}} may also be using other illicit drugs. The intravenous use of temazepam poses {{the greatest threat to}} those who misuse benzodiazepines. Simultaneous consumption of temazepam with heroin is a potential risk factor of overdose. An Australian study of non-fatal heroin overdoses noted that 26% of heroin users had consumed temazepam {{at the time of their}} overdose. This is consistent with an NSW investigation of coronial files from 1992. Temazepam was found in 26% of heroin-related deaths. Temazepam, including tablet formulations, are used intravenously. In an Australian study of 210 heroin users who used temazepam, 48% had injected it. Although abuse of benzodiazepines has decreased over the past few years, temazepam continues to be a major drug of abuse in Australia. In certain states like Victoria and Queensland, temazepam accounts for most benzodiazepine sought by forgery of prescriptions and through pharmacy burglary. Darke, Ross & Hall found that different benzodiazepines have different abuse potential. The more rapid the increase in the <b>plasma</b> <b>level</b> following ingestion, the greater the intoxicating effect and the more open to abuse the drug becomes. The speed of onset of action of a particular benzodiazepine correlates well with the ‘popularity’ of that drug for abuse. The two most common reasons for preference for a benzodiazepine were that it was the ‘strongest’ and that it gave a good ‘high’.|$|E
