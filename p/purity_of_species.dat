60|$|But {{is it not}} {{possible}} to apply a test whereby a true species may be known from a mere variety? Is there no criterion of species? Great authorities affirm that there is--that the unions {{of members of the}} same species are always fertile, while those of distinct species are either sterile, or their offspring, called hybrids, are so. It is affirmed not only that this is an experimental fact, but that it is a provision for the preservation of the <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> <b>species.</b> Such a criterion as this would be invaluable; but, unfortunately, not only is it not obvious how to apply it in the great majority of cases in which its aid is needed, but its general validity is stoutly denied. The Hon. and Rev. Mr. Herbert, a most trustworthy authority, not only asserts as the result of his own observations and experiments that many hybrids are quite as fertile as the parent species, but he {{goes so far as to}} assert that the particular plant 'Crinum capense' is much more fertile when crossed by a distinct species than when fertilised by its proper pollen! On the other hand, the famous Gaertner, though he took the greatest pains to cross the primrose and the cowslip, succeeded only once or twice in several years; and yet it is a well-established fact that the primrose and the cowslip are only varieties of the same kind of plant. Again, such cases as the following are well established. The female of species A, if crossed with the male of species B, is fertile; but, if the female of B is crossed with the male of A, she remains barren. Facts of this kind destroy the value of the supposed criterion.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA novel {{analytical}} {{strategy was}} {{proposed for the}} identification <b>of</b> selenium <b>species</b> in selenised yeast. It was based on on-line nanoHPLC electrospray hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight MS/MS analysis following a one-step fractionation of an aqueous extract by size-exclusion chromatography. The enhanced <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>species</b> arriving at a given moment at the detector allowed the detection {{of a series of}} compounds with the characteristic selenium isotopic pattern during a single chromatographic run. The high resolution and mass accuracy provided by the TOF analyser allowed, in combination with the double bond equivalent information and in-source fragmentation data, the determination of the empirical formulae of the detected selenium species. The identification was completed by targeted on-line fragmentation of pseudomolecular ions corresponding to the most abundant Se isotopes. Besides the identification of previously reported compounds (m/z 433, m/z 431) the data obtained confirmed the presence and allowed the structural characterization of 5 new adenine-containing selenium species (m/z 661, 613, 475, 406 and 403) along with some of their sulfur analogues. The signal-to background ratios obtained for these compounds with ES-MS detection were distinctly higher than those obtained with ICP-MS detection. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2006...|$|R

5000|$|Animals of {{domestic}} origin sometimes can produce fertile hybrids with native, wild animals {{which leads to}} genetic pollution (not a clear term itself) in the naturally evolved wild gene pools, many times threatening rare species with extinction. Cases include the mallard duck, wild boar, the rock dove or pigeon, the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) (ancestor of all chickens), carp, and more recently salmon. Other examples of genetic swamping lie in the breeding history of dingoes. Dingoes are wild true dogs that will interbreed with dogs of other origins, thus leading to the proliferation of dingo hybrids {{and the possibility of}} the extinction of pure wild dingoes. Researches in Scotland have remarked on a similar phenomenon of the genetic mixing of feral domestic cats and their wild counterparts. In some cases like rabbits, genetic pollution seems not to be noticed.

40|$|Background:Purity of drug {{substance}} (API) used for clinical study {{must be the}} same orhigher than that of API used for non-clinical study (NCAPI). It is important toallow flexibility in developing manufacturing process to designand control the <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> NCAPI. There arevarious ways to optimize the purity on purpose, such as addition of individualimpurities on use of harsh chemical reactions. Inthe present study, we established a method to ensurethe desired <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> NCAPI by adding a separate setof API containing various <b>species</b> <b>of</b> impurities (IMAPI). Methods: Firstly, the target purity ofNCAPI {{was determined by the}} <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> API used for a two-week repeated dosetoxicity study in the dog. Secondly, IMAPI was prepared in lab, and labexperiments were conducted to determine how much IMAPIneeded to achieve the target <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> NCAPI at large-scalemanufacturing. Thirdly, we conducted large-scale manufacturing by addition ofIMAPI and confirmed whether the <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> NCAPI was within the desired one. Results: The <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> API used in the dogtoxicity study was 97. 8 %, so we set the target purity at 98 %. IMAPI wassynthesized with the <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> 82. 2 %, and added to the reaction mixture inlarge-scale production.

40|$|The project {{traces the}} {{cultural}} changes in European botanic gardens with special reference {{to those in}} Britain, {{from the early days}} of medicine to more recent habitat creations and from plant taxonomy through to the new science of plant ecology. The main aim was to identify which British botanic gardens contribute to the biodiversity, conservation and display of British flora. Another important part was to :find out the opinions of the botanic garden administration and the informed public, thereby discovering the merits, validity and impact of British habitat creation within the botanic garden situation. First-hand investigations were made into the types of habitat which have, or are being, created, discovering habitat definition and the principles behind habitat creation as well as the value that these habitats have for conservation and education. During the research period, out of the listed botanic gardens, twelve botanic gardens were found to contribute in a major way to British Habitat Creation, most of them being influenced by their geographical position. A small number show some evidence of British habitat representation but not in a sufficiently comprehensive manner for detailed study. Botanic gardens are becoming more aware of the recovery, maintenance and preservation <b>of</b> genetic <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> native <b>species.</b> For further reform to take place {{there is a need to}} review training programmes to include principles of British conservation as well as co-ordinated action between national and local wildlife groups and to improve interpretation and display in order to encourage public interest in British habitats.

40|$|Introduction of {{non-indigenous}} taxa by anthropogenic {{activities may}} lead to the generation of hybrid forms and cause genetic pollution <b>of</b> native <b>species.</b> Populations <b>of</b> different Salmo <b>species</b> are threatened in Italy by hybridization and introgression caused by allochthonous lineages introduced since historical times. In particular, Salmo marmoratus is currently sympatric with domestic lineages of Salmo trutta in most of its native geographical range and reproductive interfecundity between the two taxa is seriously threatening the genetic <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> the endemic <b>species.</b> To fulfill conservation purposes and fisheries management, an investigation based on single and multilocus DNA fingerprinting was carried out both to assess marble trout genetic diversity and the method's amenability to restocking practices. RFLPs (Restriction Fragments Length Polymorphisms) and SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) in mitochondrial 16 S rDNA, D-loop, and nuclear LDH-C 1 * sequences were genotyped in more than 350 samples collected from different hatcheries in Northern Italy. The combination of the three markers allowed the selection of putative pure individuals of S. marmoratus to be submitted to additional highly polymorphic AFLPs (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms) analyses. Additional benefits of AFLPs over other techniques emerged in connection with their potential power for fish stock identification. In fact, 52 % of all analyzed samples were potentially pure marble trout, 4 % were pure Atlantic trout and 44 % were hybrids showing different combinations of haplotypes/genotypes. The combined approach demonstrated improved resolution to reveal hybridization not detected by classical diagnostic markers, and to select breeders for reintroduction programs...|$|R

40|$|Hybridization between {{wild species}} and their {{domestic}} relatives {{can be an}} important conservation and management problem. Genetic <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> the wild <b>species</b> is desirable per se and the phenomenon can have unpredictable evolutionary consequences. Declining European wild boar populations were frequently restocked with farmed wild boars that sometimes had been crossed with domestic pigs. We used simple polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostic tests to detect the presence of mitochondrial DNA and coat colour alleles of domestic origin in wild boars from Belgium, Luxembourg, and western Germany. Microsatellite genotypes were used to test for genetic admixture between the wild boars and domestic pigs. Although almost one-third of all Luxembourg wild boars carried Asian mitochondrial DNA haplotypes originating from domestic pigs, microsatellite-based clustering only identified four putatively admixed individuals in Luxembourg. By contrast, clustering identified wild boar x domestic hybrids in most sampling locations in Belgium. We interpret these results as evidence of releases of hybrid captive-reared wild boars. Our results emphasize the need (if working with classical markers) to use different systems to obtain an understanding as to whether hybridization between wild and domestic relatives might have affected the genetic make-up of a local population.

40|$|Laboratories {{studying}} high-priority pathogens need comprehensive {{methods to}} confirm microbial species and strains while also detecting contamination. Metagenomic deep sequencing (MDS) inventories nucleic acids present in laboratory stocks, providing an unbiased assessment of pathogen identity, {{the extent of}} genomic variation, {{and the presence of}} contaminants. Double-stranded cDNA MDS libraries were constructed from RNA extracted from in vitro-passaged stocks of six viruses (La Crosse virus, Ebola virus, canine distemper virus, measles virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus). Each library was dual indexed and pooled for sequencing. A custom bioinformatics pipeline determined the organisms present in each sample in a blinded fashion. Single nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis identified viral isolates. We confirmed that (i) each sample contained the expected microbe, (ii) dual indexing of the samples minimized false assignments of individual sequences, (iii) multiple viral and bacterial contaminants were present, and (iv) SNV analysis of the viral genomes allowed precise identification of the viral isolates. MDS can be multiplexed to allow simultaneous and unbiased interrogation of mixed microbial cultures and (i) confirm pathogen identity, (ii) characterize the extent of genomic variation, (iii) confirm the cell line used for virus propagation, and (iv) assess for contaminating microbes. These assessments ensure the true composition of these high-priority reagents and generate a comprehensive database of microbial genomes studied in each facility.

Discourses around the <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> the human <b>species</b> abound, and they help to maintain the separation between humans and between humans and nonhuman animals. Birke and Michael, 1 following Latour, 2 call this process of keeping separate the human and nonhuman ‘purification’. This artificial separation perpetuates discourses and practices of colonialism, racism and sexism, which extend to nonhuman animals through the process I call ‘othering’, which is a desperate attempt at keeping the boundaries between ‘the self‘ and ‘the other’, intact. However, this constant policing of boundaries, which Latour sees as obsessive in modernity, covers up increasing anxieties over hybridity [...] because, as Birke and Michael note: ‘[T]he notion of hybridity implies boundary [...] crossing and mixing [...] if not literally, then certainly at a conceptual level’. 3 This would confuse, they suggest, issues of humanity, animality and even of individuality.

40|$|AbstractCarboxylate anions {{arising from}} collision-induced {{dissociation}} (CID) of the [M − 15]− ion produced by {{fast atom bombardment}} (FAB) of glycerophosphocholine (GPCho) were previously shown to be produced in an abundance ratio of 1 : 3 for the carboxylic acids esterified at sn - 1 and sn - 2, respectively. This observation has been confirmed {{in a series of}} 13 synthetic GPCho molecular species. A good correlation was found between the isomeric <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> GPCho molecular <b>species</b> as determined by negative-ion FAB/CID analysis and the isomeric <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> the sn - 2 fatty acid using a phospholipase A 2 assay. Negative-ion FAB mass spectra of several 1 -O-alkyl- 2 -acyl-GPCho molecular species were found to be similar to those of diacyl GPCho. However, the CID spectra from the major high-mass ions are different from those <b>of</b> the diacyl <b>species</b> in that the [M − 15]− ion yields only one carboxylate anion and the [M − 86]− undergoes a neutral loss of the sn - 2 carboxylic acid as a major decomposition product. These reuslts suggest several rules useful for structural characterization <b>of</b> GPCho molecular <b>species</b> by negative-ion tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) : (1) For diacyl <b>species,</b> the mass <b>of</b> the two carboxyl anions plus the mass of the GPCho backbone (minus a methyl group) must correspond to the mass of the [M − 15] anion; (2) for diacyl species there is a carboxylate anion ratio approximately 1 : 3 for the substituents at sn - 1 and sn - 2; and (3) for alkylether species, only one fatty acyl group is present, and the difference between the [M − 15] ion and the GPCho backbone (minus methyl) plus the fatty acyl group at sn - 2 corresponds to an alkylether substituent. (4) Assignment <b>of</b> ether-linked molecular <b>species</b> can be made from the [M − 86]− ion, which has a strong neutral loss of the sn - 2 fatty acid. Analysis of GPCho isolated from human neutrophils by total lipid extraction and normal-phase HPLC was carried out by negative-ion FAB and MS/MS. The major arachidonate-containing molecular species, which comprise only 5 % of total GPCho, were identified by using precursor ion scans for the arachidonate anion, m/z 303. Decomposition of identified precursor ions permitted the assignment <b>of</b> those molecular <b>species</b> <b>of</b> GPCho that contain arachidonate at sn - 2 and identification of the substituent at the sn - 1 position.
