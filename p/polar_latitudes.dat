Early on February1, the disturbance intensified into a tropical depression while turning more to the south. Around that time, it passed about 500km (310mi) east of Rodrigues. The system became extratropical on February3, after increased wind shear weakened the convection.

Besides, there is a probability of temperature changes in meso- and lower thermosphere. However, it is not quite clear if the temperature always increases as expected from some observations (von Savigny et al. 2007) and model calculations (Roble et al. 1987; Barabash et al. 2004). Jackman et al. (2007) found that the temperature is decreasing in most cases of the investigated events. Singer et al. (2008) reported that the observations made with meteor radars in polar (Andenes, 69 °N) and middle (Juliusruh, 54 °N) latitudes also gave strong indications for such temperature decreases, which may have a dynamic cause. On the other hand, if temperature was increased because of particle precipitation, then the photo-dissociation of water vapor may destroy PMSE by compensating the increasing electron density. Bremer et al. (2006) observed an unusual low PMSE occurrence rate during the year 2002.

" "This thesis examines one possible influence on meteor decay times, the background atmospheric electron density variations. At the main meteor layer (about 50 to 95 km above Earth’s surface), the ionosphere electron density varies between daytime and nighttime. The meteor decay time dependency on solar zenith angle, time of year and altitude were studied to understand the relation between meteor decay time behaviour and background atmospheric electron density variations.

40|$|The {{climate of}} the Earth is {{determined}} by its balance of radiation. The incoming and outgoing radiation fluxes are strongly modulated by clouds, which are not well understood. The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (Barkstrom and Smith, 1986) provided data from which the effects of clouds on radiation {{at the top of}} the atmosphere (TOA) could be computed (Ramanathan, 1987). At TOA, clouds increase the reflected solar radiation, tending to cool the planet, and decrease the OLR, causing the planet to retain its heat (Ramanathan et al., 1989; Harrison et al., 1990). The effects of clouds on radiation fluxes are denoted cloud forcing. These shortwave and longwave forcings counter each other to various degrees, so that in the tropics the result is a near balance. Over mid and <b>polar</b> <b>latitude</b> oceans, cloud forcing at TOA results in large net loss of radiation. Here, there are large areas of stratus clouds and cloud systems associated with storms. These systems are sensitive to surface temperatures and vary strongly with the annual cycle. During winter, anticyclones form over the continents and move to the oceans during summer. This movement of major cloud systems causes large changes of surface radiation, which in turn drives the surface temperature and sensible and latent heat released to the atmosphere...|$|R

The seasonal pattern of phase scin-tillation with respect to the station indicates that the GPS phase scintillation occurrence is a local winter phenome-non, which shows consistent results with past studies of 250 MHz satellite beacon measurements. The occurrence rates of GPS amplitude scintillation at the two stations are below 1 %. A comparison with the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) By and Bz components shows that the phase scintillation occurrence level is higher during the period from later afternoon to sunset (16 – 19 h) at Ny-Alesund, and from sunset to pre-midnight (18 – 23 h) at Larsemann Hills for negative IMF components.

The abundant corals and reptiles of the Oolite and Lias indicate equally tropical conditions; but further back, in the Trias, the flora and fauna, in the British area, become poorer, and there is nothing incompatible with a climate no warmer than that of the Upper Miocene. This poverty is still more marked in the Permian formation, and it is here that some indications of ice-action are found in the Lower Permian conglomerates of the west of England. These beds contain abundant fragments of various rocks, often angular and sometimes weighing half a ton, while others are partially rounded, and have polished and striated surfaces, just like the stones of the [...] "till."

3000|$|More {{than four}} years of {{simulated}} vector Swarm A and B data are selected between a simulated time period extending from July 1998 to December 2002. These data are sub-sampled every 10 seconds, corresponding to a spacing of about 70 km along the satellite track at 400 km altitude. This ensures that no aliasing occurs because of magnetic field contributions at small wavelengths (recall that the minimum spatial wavelength detected by the regional model is 130 km with the current setting). Although the synthetic data do not contain toroidal external fields from field aligned currents, we account for the different behavior of the external field with latitudes by separating the vector data in two sets, one for mid-latitudes (− 52 ° to 52 ° magnetic latitudes), and one for polar regions (> 52 ° and <− 52 °). In addition, we allow an overlap of 10 ° between mid and <b>polar</b> <b>latitude</b> regions (see also Maus et al., 2008, for instance) so that the provisional selected data for both sets range between − 57 ° to 57 ° magnetic latitude for the mid-latitude set and above ǀ± 47 ǀ for the polar set. As discussed below, this overlap is introduced to reduce correction errors caused by dedicated corrections applied along the satellite tracks.

Special attention is paid to a comparison of climatological aspects between the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and the Southern Hemisphere (SH). In order to see the general picture of the annual mach of the upper stratosphere, the zonal mean values of geopotential height of the 1 mb level at 70 deg N and 70 deg S were plotted on the daily basis throughout a year. It is observed that, during the winter, the zonal mean 1 mb height in the NH is much more variable than that in the SH. It is also notable that the SH height is rather oscillatory throughout the longer period from midwinter to early summer. Since the zonal mean height in the <b>polar</b> <b>latitude</b> is a rough measure of the mean zonal flow in extratropical latitudes, the difference of the seasonal variation between the two hemispheres mentioned above is considered to be due mainly to the planetary wave-mean flow interaction in the middle atmosphere. The wave activity in the middle atmosphere is represented more rigorously by the Eliassen-Palm flux associated with vertically propagating planetary waves forced from below. The day-to-day variation of the EP flux in the upper stratosphere shows that the wave activity varies intermittently with a characteristic time scale of about two weeks...|$|R

The lidar at Poker Flat Research Range (PFRR), Chatanika (65 °N, 147 °W) measured a maximum integrated backscatter coefficient of 2. 4 × 10 − 6 sr− 1 with a peak backscatter coefficient of 2. 6 × 10 − 9 m− 1 sr− 1 corresponding to an aerosol backscatter ratio of 120 at an altitude of 82. 1 km. The camera at Donnelly Dome, 168 km southeast of PFRR, recorded an extensive NLC display across the sky with distinct filamentary features corresponding to wave structures measured by the lidar. The occurrence of the maximum integrated backscatter coefficient corresponded to the passage of a bright cloud band to the southwest over PFRR. The camera observations indicate that the cloud band had a horizontal width of 50 km and a length of 150 km. The horizontal scale of the cloud band was confirmed by medium-frequency radar wind measurements that reported mesopause region winds of 30 m/s to the southwest during the period when the cloud band passed over PFRR. Comparison of these measurements with current NLC microphysical models suggests a lower bound on the water vapor mixing ratio at 83 km of 7 – 9 ppmv and a cloud ice mass of 1. 5 – 1. 8 × 103 kg.
