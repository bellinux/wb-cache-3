5|$|Ballas and {{carbonado}} diamond are exceptional, as {{they are}} <b>polycrystalline</b> and therefore much tougher than single-crystal diamond; they are used for deep-drilling bits and other demanding industrial applications. Particular faceting shapes of diamonds {{are more prone to}} breakage and thus may be uninsurable by reputable insurance companies. The brilliant cut of gemstones is designed specifically to reduce the likelihood of breakage or splintering.|$|E
5|$|Little Ring Mountain at the {{northern}} end of the field contains at least 70% brown volcanic glass with isolated phenocrysts of plagioclase. Vesicular textures are up to 5%, suggesting that the lava erupted subaerially. Probable xenocrysts of quartz have been identified at the volcano. At least one xenolith fragment has been found in loose rubble at the volcano and included several quartz xenocrysts and <b>polycrystalline</b> quartz xenoliths in a glassy matrix with trachytic plagioclase.|$|E
5|$|Rhodocene {{itself is}} then formed by {{reduction}} of rhodocenium salts with molten sodium. If a rhodocenium containing melt is treated with sodium or potassium metals and then sublimed onto a liquid nitrogen-cooled cold finger, a black <b>polycrystalline</b> material results. Warming this material to room temperature produces a yellow solid which has been confirmed as the rhodocene dimer. A similar method {{can be used to}} prepare the iridocene dimer.|$|E
5|$|The free {{element is}} {{remarkable}} for its robustness, especially {{the fact that}} it has the highest melting point of all the elements discovered, melting at 3422°C (6192°F, 3695K). It also has the second highest boiling point, at 5930°C (10706°F, 6203K). Its density is 19.3 times that of water, comparable to that of uranium and gold, and much higher (about 1.7 times) than that of lead. <b>Polycrystalline</b> tungsten is an intrinsically brittle and hard material (under standard conditions, when uncombined), making it difficult to work. However, pure single-crystalline tungsten is more ductile, and can be cut with a hard-steel hacksaw.|$|E
5|$|The usual form of {{diamond in}} cutting tools is micrometer-sized grains {{dispersed}} {{in a metal}} matrix (usually cobalt) sintered onto the tool. This is typically referred to in industry as <b>polycrystalline</b> diamond (PCD). PCD-tipped tools {{can be found in}} mining and cutting applications. For the past fifteen years, work has been done to coat metallic tools with CVD diamond, and though the work still shows promise it has not significantly replaced traditional PCD tools.|$|E
5|$|Those {{materials}} are extremely hard, with the hardness of bulk c-BN being slightly smaller and w-BN even {{higher than that}} of diamond. <b>Polycrystalline</b> c-BN with grain sizes on the order of 10nm is also reported to have Vickers hardness comparable or higher than diamond. Because of much better stability to heat and transition metals, c-BN surpasses diamond in mechanical applications, such as machining steel. The thermal conductivity of BN is among the highest of all electric insulators (see table).|$|E
5|$|Conductive CVD diamond is {{a useful}} {{electrode}} under many circumstances. Photochemical methods {{have been developed for}} covalently linking DNA to the surface of <b>polycrystalline</b> diamond films produced through CVD. Such DNA modified films can be used for detecting various biomolecules, which would interact with DNA thereby changing electrical conductivity of the diamond film. In addition, diamonds can be used to detect redox reactions that cannot ordinarily be studied and in some cases degrade redox-reactive organic contaminants in water supplies. Because diamond is mechanically and chemically stable, it can be used as an electrode under conditions that would destroy traditional materials. As an electrode, synthetic diamond can be used in waste water treatment of organic effluents and the production of strong oxidants.|$|E
5|$|Copper, silver, {{and gold}} are in group 11 of the {{periodic}} table; these three metals have one s-orbital electron {{on top of}} a filled d-electron shell and are characterized by high ductility, and electrical and thermal conductivity. The filled d-shells in these elements contribute little to interatomic interactions, which are dominated by the s-electrons through metallic bonds. Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in copper are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of copper. At the macroscopic scale, introduction of extended defects to the crystal lattice, such as grain boundaries, hinders flow of the material under applied stress, thereby increasing its hardness. For this reason, copper is usually supplied in a fine-grained <b>polycrystalline</b> form, which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{technological}} important impurities in semiconductors, including diamond. Hydrogen-related defects are very different in natural diamond and in synthetic diamond films. Those films are produced by various chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques in an atmosphere rich in hydrogen (typical hydrogen/carbon ratio >100), under strong bombardment of growing diamond by the plasma ions. As a result, CVD diamond is always rich in hydrogen and lattice vacancies. In <b>polycrystalline</b> films, much of the hydrogen may be located at the boundaries between diamond 'grains', or in non-diamond carbon inclusions. Within the diamond lattice itself, hydrogen-vacancy and hydrogen-nitrogen-vacancy complexes have been identified in negative charge states by electron paramagnetic resonance. In addition, numerous hydrogen-related IR absorption peaks are documented.|$|E
25|$|Zinc oxide (ZnO)–Wurtzite structure. While single {{crystals}} of ZnO are piezoelectric and pyroelectric, <b>polycrystalline</b> (ceramic) ZnO with randomly oriented grains exhibits neither piezoelectric nor pyroelectric effect. Not being ferroelectric, <b>polycrystalline</b> ZnO {{cannot be}} poled like barium titanate or PZT. Ceramics and <b>polycrystalline</b> thin films of ZnO may exhibit macroscopic piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity {{only if they}} are textured (grains are preferentially oriented), such that the piezoelectric and pyroelectric responses of all individual grains do not cancel. This is readily accomplished in <b>polycrystalline</b> thin films.|$|E
25|$|Ribbon silicon {{is a type}} of <b>polycrystalline</b> silicon—it {{is formed}} by drawing flat thin films from molten silicon and results in a <b>polycrystalline</b> structure. These cells are cheaper to make than multi-Si, due to a great {{reduction}} in silicon waste, as this approach does not require sawing from ingots. However, they are also less efficient.|$|E
25|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopes {{are often}} used in electron diffraction mode. The advantages of electron diffraction over X-ray crystallography are that the specimen {{need not be a}} single crystal or even a <b>polycrystalline</b> powder, and also that the Fourier transform reconstruction of the object's magnified structure occurs physically and thus avoids the need for solving the phase problem faced by the X-ray crystallographers after obtaining their X-ray diffraction patterns of a single crystal or <b>polycrystalline</b> powder.|$|E
25|$|Euhedral {{crystals}} {{are those}} with obvious, well-formed flat faces. Anhedral crystals do not, usually because the crystal is one grain in a <b>polycrystalline</b> solid.|$|E
25|$|Monodisperse powders of {{colloidal}} silica, for example, {{may therefore}} be stabilized sufficiently {{to ensure a}} high degree of order in the colloidal crystal or <b>polycrystalline</b> colloidal solid which results from aggregation. The degree of order appears to be limited by the time and space allowed for longer-range correlations to be established. Such defective <b>polycrystalline</b> structures would appear to be the basic elements of nanoscale materials science, and, therefore, provide the first step in developing a more rigorous understanding of the mechanisms involved in microstructural evolution in inorganic systems such as sintered ceramic nanomaterials.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic {{sapphire}} is {{also produced}} industrially from agglomerated aluminium oxide, sintered and fused (such as by hot isostatic pressing) in an inert atmosphere, yielding a transparent but slightly porous <b>polycrystalline</b> product.|$|E
25|$|MHV, {{made out}} of metal are also {{susceptible}} to fatigue failure owing to the <b>polycrystalline</b> characteristic of metals, {{but this is not}} an issue with pyrolytic carbon MHV because this material is not crystalline in nature.|$|E
25|$|Work in the 1970s through 1990’s {{identified}} sufficiently stable resonator {{materials and}} associated fabrication techniques. In particular, single and <b>polycrystalline</b> silicon {{was found to}} be suitable for frequency references with effectively zero aging, fatigue and hysteresis, and with moderate temperature sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|La2O3 films can be {{deposited}} by {{many different}} methods, including: chemical vapor disposition, atomic layer deposition, thermal oxidation, sputtering, and spray pyrolysis. Depositions {{of these films}} occur in a temperature range of 250–450°C. <b>Polycrystalline</b> films are formed at 350°C.|$|E
25|$|Water-based ice in {{the form}} of snow, sea ice and glaciers is a very common manifestation of {{crystalline}} or <b>polycrystalline</b> matter on Earth. A single snowflake is a single crystal or a collection of crystals, while an ice cube is a polycrystal.|$|E
25|$|AlN {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1877, {{but it was}} not until the middle of the 1980s that its potential for application in microelectronics was realized due to its relatively high thermal conductivity for an electrically insulating ceramic (70–210 W·m−1·K−1 for <b>polycrystalline</b> material, and as high as 285 W·m−1·K−1 for single crystals).|$|E
25|$|Glass is in {{widespread}} use {{largely due to}} the production of glass compositions that are transparent to visible light. In contrast, <b>polycrystalline</b> materials do not generally transmit visible light. The individual crystallites may be transparent, but their facets (grain boundaries) reflect or scatter light resulting in diffuse reflection. Glass does not contain the internal subdivisions associated with grain boundaries in polycrystals and hence does not scatter light {{in the same manner as}} a <b>polycrystalline</b> material. The surface of a glass is often smooth since during glass formation the molecules of the supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and can follow surface tension, which imposes a microscopically smooth surface. These properties, which give glass its clearness, can be retained even if glass is partially light-absorbing—i.e., colored.|$|E
25|$|Material {{development}} is still ongoing in MEMS resonator research. Significant {{effort has been}} invested in silicon-germanium (SiGe) for its low temperature fabrication and aluminum nitride (AlN) for its piezoelectric transduction. Work on micromachined quartz continues, while <b>polycrystalline</b> diamond {{has been used for}} high frequency resonators for its exceptional stiffness-to-mass ratio.|$|E
25|$|Metals {{are almost}} always <b>polycrystalline,</b> though there are {{exceptions}} like amorphous metal and single-crystal metals. The latter are grown synthetically. (A microscopically-small piece of metal may naturally form into a single crystal, but larger pieces generally do not.) Ionic compound materials are usually crystalline or <b>polycrystalline.</b> In practice, large salt crystals can be created by solidification of a molten fluid, or by crystallization out of a solution. Covalently bonded solids (sometimes called covalent network solids) are also very common, notable examples being diamond and quartz. Weak van der Waals forces also help hold together certain crystals, such as crystalline molecular solids, {{as well as the}} interlayer bonding in graphite. Polymer materials generally will form crystalline regions, but the lengths of the molecules usually prevent complete crystallization—and sometimes polymers are completely amorphous.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polycrystalline</b> silicon wafers {{are made}} by wire-sawing block-cast silicon ingots into 180 to 350 {{micrometer}} wafers. The wafers are usually lightly p-type-doped. A surface diffusion of n-type dopants is performed on the front side of the wafer. This forms a p–n junction a few hundred nanometers below the surface.|$|E
25|$|For a high {{resolution}} display like a TV, a TFT backplane {{is necessary to}} drive the pixels correctly. Currently, low temperature <b>polycrystalline</b> silicon (LTPS)– thin-film transistor (TFT) is used for commercial AMOLED displays. LTPS-TFT has variation of the performance in a display, so various compensation circuits have been reported.|$|E
25|$|Crystal phases {{are defined}} as regions with the same crystal structure, {{irrespective}} of orientation or twinning. Single and twinned crystalline specimens therefore constitute individual crystal phases. <b>Polycrystalline</b> or crystal powder samples may consist {{of more than one}} crystal phase. Such a phase comprises all the crystallites in the sample with the same crystal structure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polycrystalline</b> silicon, or {{multicrystalline}} silicon (multi-Si) {{cells are}} made from cast square ingots—large blocks of molten silicon carefully cooled and solidified. They consist of small crystals giving the material its typical metal flake effect. Polysilicon cells {{are the most common}} type used in photovoltaics and are less expensive, but also less efficient, than those made from monocrystalline silicon.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) {{structure is}} obtained by growing {{a layer of}} silicon dioxide (2) {{on top of a}} silicon substrate and depositing a layer of metal or <b>polycrystalline</b> silicon (the latter is commonly used). As the silicon dioxide is a dielectric material, its structure is equivalent to a planar capacitor, with one of the electrodes replaced by a semiconductor.|$|E
25|$|The high {{melting point}} of {{zirconia}} (2750°C or 4976°F) hinders controlled growth of single crystals. However, stabilization of cubic zirconium oxide had been realized early on, with the synthetic product stabilized zirconia introduced in 1929. Although cubic, {{it was in the}} form of a <b>polycrystalline</b> ceramic: it was used as a refractory material, highly resistant to chemical and thermal attack (up to 2540°C or 4604°F).|$|E
25|$|Among {{the more}} unusual body {{materials}} are amorphous silicon, <b>polycrystalline</b> silicon or other amorphous semiconductors in thin-film transistors or organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) {{that are based}} on organic semiconductors; often, OFET gate insulators and electrodes are made of organic materials, as well. Such FETs are manufactured using a variety of materials such as silicon carbide (SiC), gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium nitride (GaN), and indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs).|$|E
25|$|The acoustoelastic {{effect is}} {{an effect of}} finite {{deformation}} of non-linear elastic materials. A modern comprehensive account {{of this can be}} found in. This book treats the application of the non-linear elasticity theory and the analysis of the mechanical properties of solid materials capable of large elastic deformations. The special case of the acoustoelastic theory for a compressible isotropic hyperelastic material, like <b>polycrystalline</b> steel, is reproduced and shown in this text from the non-linear elasticity theory as presented by Ogden.|$|E
25|$|Photovoltaics (PV) is {{a method}} of {{generating}} electrical power by converting solar radiation into direct current electricity using semiconductors that exhibit the photovoltaic effect. Photovoltaic power generation employs solar panels composed {{of a number of}} solar cells containing a photovoltaic material. Materials presently used for photovoltaics include monocrystalline silicon, <b>polycrystalline</b> silicon, amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride, and copper indium gallium selenide/sulfide. Due to the increased demand for renewable energy sources, the manufacturing of solar cells and photovoltaic arrays has advanced considerably in recent years.|$|E
25|$|In the {{electron}} gun, monochromatic electrons are emitted by a cathode filament {{which is at}} a negative potential, typically 10-600 V, {{with respect to the}} sample. The electrons are accelerated and focused into a beam, typically about 0.1 to 0.5mm wide, by a series of electrodes serving as electron lenses. Some of {{the electron}}s incident on the sample surface are backscattered elastically, and diffraction can be detected if sufficient order exists on the surface. This typically requires a region of single crystal surface as wide as the electron beam, although sometimes <b>polycrystalline</b> surfaces such as highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) are sufficient.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{attenuation}} {{results from}} the incoherent scattering of light at internal surfaces and interfaces. In (<b>poly)crystalline</b> materials such as metals and ceramics, in addition to pores, most of the internal surfaces or interfaces are {{in the form of}} grain boundaries that separate tiny regions of crystalline order. It has recently been shown that when the size of the scattering center (or grain boundary) is reduced below the size of the wavelength of the light being scattered, the scattering no longer occurs to any significant extent. This phenomenon has given rise to the production of transparent ceramic materials.|$|E
25|$|The {{refractive}} index (as measured by sodium light, 589.3nm) of turquoise is approximately 1.61 or 1.62; {{this is a}} mean value seen as a single reading on a gemmological refractometer, owing to the almost invariably <b>polycrystalline</b> nature of turquoise. A reading of 1.61–1.65 (birefringence 0.040, biaxial positive) has been taken from rare single crystals. An absorption spectrum may also be obtained with a hand-held spectroscope, revealing a line at 432nm and a weak band at 460nm (this is best seen with strong reflected light). Under longwave ultraviolet light, turquoise may occasionally fluoresce green, yellow or bright blue; it is inert under shortwave ultraviolet and X-rays.|$|E
25|$|EBPVD {{systems are}} {{equipped}} with ion sources. These ion sources are used for substrate etching and cleaning, sputtering the target and controlling the microstructure of the substrate. The ion beams bombard the surface and alter the microstructure of the film. When the deposition reaction takes place on the hot substrate surface, the films can develop an internal tensile stress due to the mismatch in the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} between the substrate and the film. High-energy ions can be used to bombard these ceramic thermal barrier coatings and change the tensile stress into compressive stress. Ion bombardment also increases the density of the film, changes the grain size and modifies amorphous films to <b>polycrystalline</b> films. Low-energy ions are used for the surfaces of semiconductor films.|$|E
