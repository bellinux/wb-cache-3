40|$|A {{preliminary}} study of self-interrupted regenerative turning is performed in this paper. To facilitate the analysis, {{a new approach}} is proposed to model the regenerative effect in metal cutting. This model automatically incorporates the multiple-regenerative effects accompanying self-interrupted cutting. Some lower dimensional ODE approximations are obtained for this model using Galerkin projections. Using these ODE approximations, a bifurcation diagram of the regenerative turning process is obtained. It is found that the unstable branch resulting from the subcritical Hopf bifurcation meets the stable branch resulting from the self-interrupted dynamics in a turning point bifurcation. Using a rough analytical estimate of the turning <b>point</b> <b>tool</b> displacement, we can identify regions in the cutting parameter space where loss of stability leads to much greater amplitude self-interrupted motions than in some other regions...|$|E

40|$|A steel disc is cut using {{a single}} <b>point</b> <b>tool.</b> The {{coefficient}} of friction of the nascent cut surface is measured by a spherical steel pin situated in close proximity of the point of cutting. The tool, disc and the friction pin are immersed in an oil in water emulsion bath during the experiment. The purpose of the experiments conducted here is to record the effect of hydrophilic/lypophilic balance (HLB) of the emulsifier on the lubricity experienced in the cutting operation. The more lypophilic emulsifiers were found to give greater lubricity than what is recorded when the emulsifier is more hydrophilic. XPS and FTIR spectroscopy are used to explore the tribofilm generated on the nascent cut surface to indicate a possible rationale for the effect. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|International audienceToday {{embedded}} systems {{are complex and}} their development {{is based on the}} use of a large set of tools. Although point to <b>point</b> <b>tool</b> integration can be e cient, it is not very well adapted to changing because it remains costly and human expensive. To solve this problem, several approaches on tool integration have been proposed. Even if those approaches handle the exibility and the obsolescence issues, the tool synergy cannot still be achieved due to major problems such as technological or semantic gaps. Recently, new techniques such as model based engineering and communities such as OSLC have emerged. They represent a promising approach for signi cant improvement of integration frameworks. In this paper, we present the basics for an integration framework supporting HW/SW co-design development that takes bene- ts from modeling and current standards.

40|$|The {{functions}} {{to evaluate the}} machinability of ceramics in grinding, honing and superfinishing are derived theoretically, assuming that one stone (wheel) corresponds to a single <b>point</b> <b>tool</b> with a long cutting edge. The dimensional analysis is employed to investigate the effect of physical properties of the ceramic material on its machinability. Work materials used in experiments are Al 2 O 3, SiC, Si 3 N 4, ZrO 2 which are sintered under atmospheric pressure, Mn-Zn ferrite and SiO 2. The main results are as follows. The machinability of the ceramic material depends on not only its physical properties but also the method of machining. For the work materials of Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2, the honing is superior in cutting ability to the grinding. In grinding and superfinishing the strong relation is observed between the energy release rate of the ceramic and its machinability, but in honing it is observed between the hardness of the ceramic and its machinability...|$|E

The formability was also investigated by comparing the forming limits of micropyramids of aluminum foil formed with and without ultrasonic vibration. The shapes of pyramids incrementally formed were truncated pyramids, twisted pyramids, stepwise pyramids, and star pyramids about 1 mm in size. A much smaller truncated pyramid was formed only for titanium foil for qualitative investigation of the size reduction on forming accuracy. It was found that the ultrasonic vibration improved the shape accuracy of the formed pyramids. In addition, laser heating increased the forming limit of aluminum foil and it is more effective when both the ultrasonic vibration and laser heating are applied...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Glass is an {{important}} engineering material used {{in the manufacture of}} different components of engineering systems. Sodalime glass is {{the most common form of}} glass whose application includes manufacture of glass plates which are used in modern devices including TFT-LCDs, touch panels, thin-film solar cells, and color filters. For any application, the cutting of glass is the initial step in fabrication. The conventional method of glass cutting involves using a diamond <b>point</b> <b>tool</b> or wheel to mechanically score a line along the desired path. This is followed by application of bending force to break the glass along the scored line. This method has disadvantages that include: microcracks that serve as stress risers of tension and cause the fracture of the glass if loaded, rough edges requiring further machining and material wastage among others. Laser cutting has numerous advantages over the conventional methods regarding quality and is attaining wide acceptance in ma-chining of glass. Laser machining can be achieved through melting and vaporization or thermal stress fracture. The performance and thermal effects of a process must be well understood in order for process control to succeed.
