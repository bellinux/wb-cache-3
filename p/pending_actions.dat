25|$|When the {{existence}} of the skin gambling situation was discovered in mid-2016, estimates for the economics of skin gambling market had dropped, but by early 2017, these analysts found the market did not drop as much as they expected, and with gambling sites still open and growing, they do not expect to see this diminish in the near future unless the legal matters are resolved. Analysis firm Naruscope estimated in early 2017 that even with increased awareness of the legal ramifications of skin gambling, there could be as much as $12.9 billion gambled this way by 2020, compared to their previous estimate of $20 billion made in mid-2016. Grove places much of the future of skin gambling on Valve and its control over the Steam API that enables the third-party websites; Valve had stated that changing the API to cut off these websites would also affect other legal activities that could be performed with it, making it difficult to enforce without more direct oversight and monitoring by Valve. It is unclear if the two lawsuits against Valve will come to a full trial, and thus attention is being placed on the Washington State Gambling Commission's <b>pending</b> <b>actions</b> to resolve the situation.|$|E

The law provides solutions to problems which arise in connection with cross-border bankruptcy, allowing US courts to issue subpoenas, orders to turn over assets, the issuance of stays on <b>pending</b> <b>actions,</b> and orders of other types as circumstances dictate. The ancillary proceeding permitted under Chapter 15 is often a more efficient and less costly alternative to initiating an independent bankruptcy proceeding in the United States. It also avoids the conflicts which could arise between the jurisdictions involved in two independent bankruptcy proceedings initiated {{in connection with the}} same debtor.|$|E

40|$|With {{less than}} two years after its ratification, many of the {{economic}} gains expected under JPEPA have yet to be realized. But while critics may be quick to judge its failure due to this seeming lack of progress, neither have there been costs and dislocations that should have been more immediately evident. Moreover, the recent trends in trade and investments appear encouraging. Nonetheless, the implementation of JPEPA is wrought with challenges particularly those that involve undertaking internal reforms needed to realize its rich potential and achieve the vision upon which it was established. Being the first bilateral free trade agreement entered into by the Philippines, the performance of and experience with JPEPA are crucial in determining the prospects for negotiated trade agreements with the country. The Philippines cannot afford to slow down with the pace of reform and needs to march aggressively alongside its neighbors in East Asia, which is leading the move toward regional integration. This paper will revisit the seminal studies that examined the desirability of JPEPA with the aim of bringing to the fore the <b>pending</b> <b>actions</b> to generate the expected benefits from JPEPA.

40|$|Poland {{joined the}} EU on 1 May 2004. The initial “honeymoon” period has, {{generally}} speaking, been a happy one {{and there have}} been few prominent cases decided at the administrative level (i. e. the European Commission) or brought before the judiciary (i. e. the European Community Courts). That said, usually following notifications by Polish authorities, the Commission has taken a number of important individual decisions in the field of State aid (including the misuse of aid decisions in the steel sector and the Power Purchase Agreements decision), which have led to litigation before the Community Courts. The Commission’s decisions in Polish cases have already provided important clarifications (e. g. regarding the application of alternative State aid exemptions to pre-accession restructuring cases in Technologie Buczek) and raised significant new legal issues (e. g. the application of the EC State aid rules to pre-accession aid under Protocol No. 8 of the Accession Treaty in Huta Częstochowa or an agent’s actions triggering pre-accession cartel liability in BR/ESBR). <b>Pending</b> <b>actions</b> in these cases can and lead to further case law developments, especially with regard to Protocol No. 8 the Commission’s Rescue & Restructuring Guidelines. ...|$|E
40|$|Management of pending tasks {{is one of}} the {{activities}} commonly performed in email [12].

This research explores how to better support <b>pending</b> <b>actions</b> in email and explores alternative solutions that use different external representations and interaction techniques with messages and associated tasks. In a recent study we compared the effects of two email user interfaces (a typical tabular inbox and a 2 D grid containing explicit temporal information) on efficiency and effectiveness of task information retrieval from email messages. We found that the latter interface was overall faster for finding information related to task dates, time and task overviews, while the inbox interface was faster for finding information from subject lines, senders or from the message body. We are currently designing and implementing a new prototype email user interface (Email Land), where users will be able to create their own visual organization of messages on a 2 D plane. The interface is based on ZUI...|$|E
