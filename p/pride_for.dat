5|$|Manchester United {{winning the}} 2010–11 Premier League title {{earlier in the}} day meant double <b>pride</b> <b>for</b> Manchester as its teams claimed both of English {{football}}'s blue ribbon competitions. Some football pundits debated whether the joint win – along with City's qualification for the Champions League – would mark the start of new era similar to the late 1960s when both City and United dominated English football; during that period, both clubs won the league championship once, with United winning the European Cup and City winning the FA Cup, League Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup within four years. The '35 years' banner that had stood at Old Trafford, home of Manchester United which referenced to Manchester City's long trophy drought, was taken down in recognition of City's victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{aesthetic}} and technical mastery of Borobudur, and also its sheer size, has evoked {{the sense of}} grandeur and <b>pride</b> <b>for</b> Indonesians. Just like Angkor Wat for Cambodian, Borobudur has become a powerful symbol for Indonesia — to testify for its past greatness. Sukarno {{made a point of}} showing the site to foreign dignitaries. The Suharto regime — realized its important symbolic and economic meanings — diligently embarked on a massive project to restore the monument with the help from UNESCO. Many museums in Indonesia contain a scale model replica of Borobudur. The monument has become almost an icon, grouped with the wayang puppet play and gamelan music into a vague classical Javanese past from which Indonesians are to draw inspiration.|$|E
5|$|The territory's {{contributions}} {{during the}} First World War {{became a major}} entry in many histories of the colony, and {{a great source of}} <b>pride</b> <b>for</b> the white community, as well as for some black Rhodesians. It played a part in the UK government's decision to grant self-government in 1923, and remained prominent in the national consciousness for decades. When the colonial government unilaterally declared independence from Britain in 1965, it deliberately did so on Armistice Day, 11 November, and signed the proclamation at 11:00 local time. Since the territory's reconstitution and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, the modern government has removed many references to the war, such as memorial monuments and plaques, from public view, regarding them as unwelcome vestiges of white minority rule and colonialism. The Zimbabwean cultural memory has largely forgotten the First World War; the country's war dead today have no official commemoration, either there or overseas.|$|E

5|$|When she died, Tubman {{was buried}} with semi-military honors at Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn. The city commemorated {{her life with}} a plaque on the courthouse. Although it showed <b>pride</b> <b>for</b> her many achievements, its use of dialect ("I nebber run my train off de track"), {{apparently}} chosen for its authenticity, {{has been criticized for}} undermining her stature as an American patriot and dedicated humanitarian. Still, the dedication ceremony was a powerful tribute to her memory, and Booker T. Washington delivered the keynote address. The Harriet Tubman home was abandoned after 1920, but was later renovated by the AME Zion Church. Today, it welcomes visitors as a museum and education center.|$|E
