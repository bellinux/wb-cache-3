40|$|This thesis mainly {{studies the}} 3 D {{homogeneous}} Boltzmann equation for hard potentials and moderately soft potentials and the equivalence between some jumping SDE {{and the corresponding}} PDE. In particular, we compute the multifractal spectrum of some stochastic processes, study the well-posedness and the propagation of chaos for the Boltzmann equation. The purpose of the first chapter is to study the pathwise properties of the stochastic process (V_t) _t≥ 0, representing the time-evolution of the velocity of a typical particle in a gas modeled by the Boltzmann equation for hard or moderately potentials. We show that this process is multifractal and has a deterministic spectrum. For hard potentials, we also give the multifractal spectrum of the process X_t =∫_ 0 ^t V_s ds, representing the time-evolution {{of the position of}} the typical particle. The second chapter is devoted to study the uniqueness of the weak solution to the Boltzmann equation in the class of all measure solutions, in the case of moderately soft potentials. This allows us to obtain a quantitive rate of propagation of chaos for Nanbu particle system for this singular interaction. Finally in the third chapter, we extend Figalli’s work [19] to study the relation between some jumping SDE and the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. We prove that for any weak solution (ft) _t∈[0,T] of the PDE, there exists a weak solution to the SDE of which the time-marginals are given by the family (f_t) _t∈[0,T]Dans cette thèse, on étudie principalement l’équation de Boltzmann homogène 3 D pour les <b>potentiels</b> durs et les <b>potentiels</b> modérément mous et l’équivalence entre une EDS à sauts et l’EDP correspondante.

40|$|We {{take up the}} {{question}} of potential conflicts between the objectives of risk management policies and those connected with maximization of the firm’s value. This question is a timely one, since many firms have a special committee devoted to risk management—banks and insurance companies in particular. In {{the wake of the}} Enron affair, various proposals have been formulated regarding the composition of the different committees set up by boards of directors. In the financial literature, it is now a widely accepted fact that risk management issues can give rise to conflicts of interest between heads of firms and shareholders, notably when executives are remunerated in stock options. In our opinion, the board’s risk management committee must be composed of competent and independent directors who hold no options to purchase the firm’s shares.

It follows from an article that {{was published in the}} Canadian Journal of Communication in 1990, “Integrating Research into Instructional Practice: The Use and Abuse of Meta-analysis, ” which introduced meta-analysis as a means for estimating population parameters and summarizing quantitative research around instructional research questions.

It then goes on to describe substantive and methodological aspects of meta-analysis where various kinds of bias can influence the outcomes and suggests measures that can be taken to avoid them. The intention is to improve the reliability and accuracy of reviews so that practitioners can trust the results and use them more effectively.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between 2 defecting strategies based on the manipulation of information; namely, Machiavellianism and economic opportunism. There are 3 main hypotheses that were confirmed in questionnaire investigations among samples of 191 and 113 university students in Athens. Machiavellianism {{was positively correlated with}} economic opportunism, shown by a statistically highly significant positive correlation between scores on scales measuring these 2 concepts. In situations of asymmetric information where they held the advantage, high Machs adopted more opportunistic strategies, showing the greatest inclination to maximize their own profit. High Machs showed less trust in potential economic partners, whom they regarded as untrustworthy maximizers. Cette recherche vise à explorer les relations entre deux stratégies de défection basées sur la manipulation de l'information, à savoir le machiavélisme et l'opportunisme économique. Dans les situations d'asymétrie d'information où les sujets ont un avantage informationnel, les « Higth Machs » adoptent des stratégies plus opportunistes qui montrent leur inclinaison plus grande à maximiser leurs profits. Par ailleurs,, ils manifestent moins de confiance envers les partenaires économiques <b>potentiels</b> qu'ils regardent ou envisagent comme maximisateurs non fiables...|$|R
40|$|Driver {{internal}} state, including emotion, {{can have}} negative impacts on road safety. Studies {{have shown that}} an anger state can provoke aggressive behavior and impair driving performance. Apart from driving, anger can also influence attentional processing and increase the benefits taken from auditory alerts. However, to our knowledge, no prior event-related potentials study assesses this impact on attention during simulated driving. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the impact of anger on attentional processing and its consequences on driving performance. For this purpose, 33 participants completed a simulated driving scenario once in an anger state and once during a control session. Results indicated that anger impacted driving performance and attention, provoking an increase in lateral variations while reducing the amplitude of the visual N 1 peak. The observed effects were discussed as a result of high arousal and mind-wandering associated with anger. This kind of physiological data may be used to monitor a driver's internal state and provide specific assistance corresponding to their current needs.

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{to be described}} in this paper {{is concerned with the}} release of phage from the lysogenie strain of B. raycoides N. Lwoff and his coworkers (1950 a) approached the problem of determining how phage is liberated in the lysogenic B. raegatkeriura, strain 899, by mieromanipulation studies. They found that bacteria in broth mierocolonies can undergo many cell divisions without releasing phage. When free phage did appear in the medium, it almost invariably followed lysis of a bacillus. Two kinds of lysis took place: slow and instantaneous. In a few cases in which free phage cropped up {{in the absence of any}} observed lysis, Lwoff contended that a bacterium had lysed so rapidly that it had gone undetected. He calculated that 1 per 300 to 1200 log phase cells lysed out, thereby releasing phage. The mechanisms postulated by the Lwoff group (1950 a, b, 1951) center about two types of bacteria existing in a lysogenic culture, namely, "lysog$nes <b>potentiels</b> " and "produaeurs. " The first are bacteria which are capable of multiplying; each cell conrains a specific particle (the probacteriophage) possessing genetic continuity. Thi...|$|R

The cell partition functions are evaluated in both the Devonshire spherical-cell approximation and by rigorous Monte Carlo inte-gration. The two methods gave satisfactory, and closely similar, results. The low occupancies of the small cages of the xenon and CF, hydrates observed experimentally are reproduced and may be ex-plained primarily as a size effect of the encaged molecules. A procedure based on the more rigorous theory of intermolecular forces is used to construct more-realistic exp- 6 - 8 - 10 potential functions for unlike pair interactions.

40|$|The {{mortality}} rates of Pacific sardine, Sardinops sagax caerulea, larvae (< 20 d) increased during 1951 - 67, and this increase {{was positively correlated}} with the increase in biomass of northern anchovy, Engraulis mordax. Other potential correlates with larval sardine {{mortality rates}} were examined using multiple correlation. These included temperature and zooplankton volumes at stations positive for sardine larvae, water column stability, upwelling, transport, salinity anomalies, and Pacific mackerel, Scomber japonicus, abundance. None contributed signifi-cantly to the multiple regression with anchovy abundance. Thus, no evidence existed for either Lasker’s stable ocean hypothesis of larval mortality or Hjort‘s larval transport hypothesis. The logarithm of the ratio of sardine recruits at age 2 to the spawning biomass was used as an index of recruitment success. Sardine recruitment success at age 2 was not correlated with larval mortality rates. Sardine recruitment, however, was negatively correlated with both northern anchovy biomass and the combined biomass of Pacific sardine, Pacific mackerel, and northern anchovy. A plausible explanation for this result is that predation by pelagic fishes results in greater mortality rates of sardine larvae and juveniles which in turn decrease sardine recruitment.
