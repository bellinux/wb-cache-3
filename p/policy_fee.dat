40|$|The Rothschild and Stiglitz adverse {{selection}} model {{is considered a}} classic among papers on the theory of markets with asymmetric information. However, this model relies on the unrealistic assumption {{that there are no}} profits or transaction costs. This paper modifies the model by incorporating various forms of transaction costs, which are either a fixed per <b>policy</b> <b>fee</b> or variable costs proportional to the premium and expected indemnity amount. Proportional costs bring distinct consequences to insurance buyers ’ behavior and partial coverage becomes the optimal choice for consumers. Departure from full coverage significantly changes the dynamics of Rothschild and Stiglitz’s arguments. We can see a new separating equilibrium if customer groups have heterogeneous risk aversion or heterogeneous endowment wealth. In these two scenarios, neither high-risk individuals nor low-risk individuals cause any externality to the other group in the market. It is demonstrated that, under more realistic hypotheses, the standard result in the analysis of the insurance market under {{adverse selection}} can be reversed...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{debate whether}} {{services}} must be charged {{or not is}} widely discussed in the library world and it still represents a controversial issue: {{the scope of this}} study is to analyse the Italian situation in order to evaluate what kind of <b>policy</b> (<b>fee</b> or free based) biomedical libraries have adopted in supplying the document delivery service (DD). Above all this study aims to state how “free” this service is in Italy. METHODS: The analysis is based on the Italian Union Catalogue of Serials - Catalogo Italiano dei Periodici (ACNP) which collects detailed data on the holdings and services of the Italian libraries and can be considered the most reliable source in this field. The available libraries’ web sites have also been consulted whenever the ACNP data were not complete or updated. DISCUSSION: Starting from the Italian context the case of the Italian National Institute of Health - Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS), one of the main biomedical Italian libraries, is presented. Special attention is focused on how the DD policy of this Library has been changing over the years from a free basis system to a hybrid one based on exchange or fee. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion it is suggested that the results of the survey could be useful in order to re-examine the current DD policy of the ISS Library and its possible future developments...|$|E

40|$|The Indiana House Enrolled Act 1481 (HEA- 1481) {{requires}} that the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) adopt final rules by December 31, 2014, for the issuance, fee structure and enforcement of permits for overweight divisible loads, fee structure of permits for loads on extra heavy duty highways, and fee structure of permits for overweight loads. On December 26, 2013, INDOT adopted the Emergency Rules regarding these items, as required by HEA- 1481, effective January 1, 2014. HEA- 1481 requires INDOT to use {{the results of this}} impact study to inform the setting of final rules. Three different fee structures were considered: Pre-HEA- 1481 fee structures were in place prior to HEA- 1481; Interim <b>Policy</b> <b>fee</b> structures were in place between June 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013; these were superseded by Emergency Rules which took effect January 1, 2014. INDOT commissioned this study to evaluate the impacts of overweight divisible load permits on revenue, asset consumption, alternative transportation modes, Indiana’s economic development, and economic competitiveness relative to other Midwestern states. The results of the analysis indicate that overall, the overweight commodities divisible permit structure arising from HEA- 1481 is not expected to change dramatically the consumption of pavement and bridge assets, lead to a slight increase in the revenue collected per permit and a slight decrease in the gap between consumption and revenue. However, the gap between revenue and consumption is still significant. From an operations standpoint, it was estimated that HEA- 141 will lead to a net decrease in safety but a net increase in mobility of the traffic stream, due to the twin but opposing effects of traffic impairment and trip substitution associated with overweight vehicle operations. Also, HEA- 1481 is expected to lead to little or no shift in the modal share across truck and rail, but significant shift in the specific configurations of vehicles used in trucking operations. The Act is expected to increase the economic competitiveness of trucking operations Indiana, compared to the pre-HEA 1481 situation. Finally, the Act is expected to increase economic development at least in the long term by reducing the cost of transportation, an essential expenditure item of most major businesses in Indiana. Overall, HEA- 1481 is expected to protect the highway bridge and pavement infrastructure by providing incentives for less-damaging loading behavior, reduce the gap between revenue and consumption, generally have slightly adverse net impacts on safety and slightly beneficial impacts of mobility, increase the economic competitiveness of trucking operations relative to other states, and provide grounds for increased economic development...|$|E

This article challenges the view that takes discrimination based on disability and discrimination based on age as so discrepant that they do not deserve similar efforts for justice and argues instead for an inclusive justice that affords meaningful access to all.
