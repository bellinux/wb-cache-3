50|$|A {{more modern}} cache might be 16 KB, 4-way set-associative, {{virtually}} indexed, virtually hinted, and physically tagged, with 32 B lines, 32-bit read width and 36-bit physical addresses. The read path recurrence {{for such a}} cache looks {{very similar to the}} path above. Instead of tags, vhints are read, and matched against a subset of the virtual address. Later on in the pipeline, the virtual address is translated into a physical address by the TLB, and the <b>physical</b> <b>tag</b> is read (just one, as the vhint supplies which way of the cache to read). Finally the physical address is compared to the <b>physical</b> <b>tag</b> to determine if a hit has occurred.|$|E
50|$|The extra area (and some latency) can be mitigated {{by keeping}} virtual hints with each cache entry instead of virtual tags. These hints {{are a subset}} or hash of the virtual tag, and are used for {{selecting}} {{the way of the}} cache from which to get data and a <b>physical</b> <b>tag.</b> Like a virtually tagged cache, there may be a virtual hint match but <b>physical</b> <b>tag</b> mismatch, in which case the cache entry with the matching hint must be evicted so that cache accesses after the cache fill at this address will have just one hint match. Since virtual hints have fewer bits than virtual tags distinguishing them from one another, a virtually hinted cache suffers more conflict misses than a virtually tagged cache.|$|E

40|$|Out-of-order {{processor}} {{performance is}} limited by instruction scheduler size. Current “issue buffer ” based instruction scheduler implementations do not scale {{with the size of}} the instruction window. We propose distributing the functions of instruction wakeup and selection-issue across separate structures specialized for each task and conclude that (1) limiting the “bandwidth of wakeup ” to the width of the pipeline does not significantly impact performance, (2) the number of instructions awaiting wakeup by a particular <b>physical</b> <b>tag</b> does not significantly increase with the scheduler size, and (3) the number of instructions which are ready for issue is considerably smaller than the size of the scheduler itself. Thus we propose the wakeup-set scheduler. Instructions with unsatisfied dependencies are placed in a bankable, limited sized wakeup-sets array where they await the production of their operands. A separate ready-instruction queue holds the instructions which are ready to issue for execution. As register values are produced, they index their wakeup-sets to discover waiting instructions. When an instruction’s dependencies are satisfied, it moves from its wakeup-set to the ready-instruction queue from where it may be issued for execution. We present a...|$|E

There {{are a number of}} new programs that have been planned for farmed abalone, such as selective breeding and genetic manipulation to meet world demand. These methods can only be successful if abalone traits and behaviour can be identified properly. Therefore, <b>physical</b> <b>tagging</b> of abalone shells and DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) pedigree markers have been developed to enable tracking and tracing of individuals. Researchers are continually finding more effective methods of <b>physical</b> <b>tagging</b> so that tags can be visualised more readily and will be retained on the abalone shell {{for a longer period of}} time. Identifying the tag and character information is also time and labour intensive. Therefore, automated image analysis of abalone tags may provide a solution for tracking abalone and for identifying abalone behaviour and pedigree information. After reviewing the broad field of computer vision, an image processing system was developed in MATLAB using appropriate image analysis and processing techniques, to automate the process of extracting sub-images of <b>physical</b> <b>tags</b> attached to the abalone shells, in preparation for input to an optical character recognition system, which would read the tags on the shells. The image processing system developed was able to successfully identify a number of tags from digital images directly taken from land-based tanks on various abalone farms; tag colour and character recognition was achieved. In addition, this research will help aquaculture researchers to study abalone movement, behaviour and performance traits in a cultured environment...|$|R

50|$|The great {{advantage}} of virtual tags is that, for associative caches, they allow the tag match to proceed before the virtual to physical translation is done. However, coherence probes and evictions present a physical address for action. The hardware {{must have some}} means of converting the physical addresses into a cache index, generally by storing <b>physical</b> <b>tags</b> as well as virtual tags. For comparison, a physically tagged cache {{does not need to}} keep virtual tags, which is simpler. When a virtual to physical mapping is deleted from the TLB, cache entries with those virtual addresses will have to be flushed somehow. Alternatively, if cache entries are allowed on pages not mapped by the TLB, then those entries will have to be flushed when the access rights on those pages are changed in the page table.|$|R

The instantiation of this link was often a complex task that involved special purpose techniques to identify and search for the virtual information that belongs to a selected physical object.

In this paper we show a simple yet effective approach to extract the virtual information of physical objects and aggregate it in a sensible way for the user.

40|$|Long-term {{ecological}} and genetic studies in natural populations of tree species require marking techniques so that individuals can be re-visited over time, even in difficult terrain. Both GPS coordinates and physical labels have disadvantages {{that can make}} re-finding trees difficult. We tested passive and semi-active radio frequency identification (RFID) tags and readers {{as a means to}} relocate individual trees. Passive RFID tags do not provide a good solution because of low transmission power of hand-held readers and strong directionality. Semi-active RFID tags provide detection over longer distances, but also suffer from strong directionality. Active RFID tags promise an improvement over semi-passive tags, and could be evaluated in a future study. We conclude that RFID technology has the potential to improve the ability of researchers to locate individual trees repeatedly under natural conditions, and can be used in conjunction with other marking techniques such as <b>physical</b> <b>tags</b> and GPS coordinates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Dispersal {{in birds}} and mammals tends to be female-biased in monoga-mous species and male-biased in {{polygamous}} species. However results for other taxa, most notably fish, are equivocal. We employed molecular markers and <b>physical</b> <b>tags</b> {{to test the hypothesis}} that Atlantic salmon, a promiscuous species with intense male-male competition for access to females, displays male-biased dispersal. We found significant variation in sex ratios and in asymmetric gene flow between neighbouring salmon populations, but little or no evidence for sex-biased dispersal. We show that conditions favouring male dispersal will often be offset by those favouring female dispersal, and that spatial and temporal variation in sex ratios within a metapopulation may favour the dispersal of different sexes in source and sink habitats. Thus, our results reconcile previous discrepancies on salmonid dis-persal and highlight the need to consider metapopulation dynamics and sex ratios in the study of natal dispersal of highly fecund species...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Recent {{research}} on multi-agent systems has pro-duced {{a plethora of}} decentralized controllers that implicitly assume various degrees of agent localization. However, many practical arrangements commonly taken to allow and achieve localization imply some form of centralization, {{from the use of}} <b>physical</b> <b>tagging</b> to allow the identification of the single agent to the adoption of global positioning systems based on cameras or GPS. These devices clearly decrease the system autonomy and range of applicability, and should be avoided if possible. Follow-ing this guideline, this work addresses the mutual localization problem with anonymous relative position measures, presenting a robust solution based on a probabilistic framework. The proposed localization system exhibits higher accuracy and lower complexity (O(n 2)) than our previous method [1]. Moreover, with respect to more conventional solutions that could be conceived {{on the basis of the}} current literature, our method is theoretically suitable for tasks requiring frequent, many-to-many encounters among agents (e. g., formation control, cooperative exploration, multiple-view environment sensing). The proposed localization system has been validated by means of an extensive experimental study. I...|$|R

5000|$|Virtually indexed, {{virtually}} tagged (VIVT) caches use {{the virtual}} address {{for both the}} index and the tag. This caching scheme can result in much faster lookups, since the MMU {{does not need to}} be consulted first to determine the physical address for a given virtual address. However, VIVT suffers from aliasing problems, where several different virtual addresses may refer to the same physical address. The result is that such addresses would be cached separately despite referring to the same memory, causing coherency problems. Another problem is homonyms, where the same virtual address maps to several different physical addresses. It is not possible to distinguish these mappings merely by looking at the virtual index itself, though potential solutions include: flushing the cache after a context switch, forcing address spaces to be non-overlapping, tagging the virtual address with an address space ID (ASID), or using <b>physical</b> <b>tags.</b> Additionally, there is a problem that virtual-to-physical mappings can change, which would require flushing cache lines, as the VAs would no longer be valid.|$|R
40|$|The {{key issues}} for {{register}} file design in high-performance processors are access time and energy. While previous work {{has focused on}} {{reducing the number of}} registers, we propose {{to reduce the number of}} register ports through two proposals, one for reads and the other for writes. For reads, we propose bypass hint to reduce register port requirements by avoiding unnecessary register file reads for cases where values are bypassed. Current processors are unable to avoid these unnecessary reads due to timing constraints. For writes, we use register file banking. Current banking schemes assign different banks to instructions that are renamed together, which does not necessarily avoid conflicts among instructions that writeback together. We use decoupled rename, a technique which separates dependence and <b>physical</b> <b>tagging</b> of register operands. Decoupled rename allows us to perform physical register allocation just before writeback, avoiding bank conflicts. Our results show that combining bypass hint and write banking, our 1 cycle register file with 6 read ports, and two 4 -write-ported banks achieves a 9 % processor energy-delay savings over a system using a perfectly-pipelined, 2 -cycle register file with 16 read ports and 8 write ports. ...|$|R

A ‘DNA stand-by method’ for identification of escaped Atlantic salmon, back to the cage and farm of origin, was established at the Institute of Marine Research in Norway.

Significant genetic structure was observed over all regions at both sets of nuclear markers, though the microsatellite data provided greater resolution in identifying significant genetic differences in pairwise tests between regions. Inferences about population structure and migration rates from the microsatellite data varied depending on whether statistics were based on the stepwise mutation or infinite allele model, with the latter being more congruent with geography. Estimated rates of gene flow were generally higher than expected for nuclear DNA (nDNA) in comparison to mtDNA, and this difference was most pronounced in comparisons between the northern and southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The genetic data combined with results from <b>physical</b> <b>tagging</b> studies indicate that the lack of nuclear gene divergence through the GBR is likely due to the migration of sGBR turtles through the courtship area of the nGBR population, rather than male-biased dispersal.
