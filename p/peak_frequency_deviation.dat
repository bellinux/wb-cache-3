30|$|From Fig  14 a, it is {{observed}} that the curve “ST-VSG” presents a frequency nadir that lies above the other two curves and the frequency overshoot is suppressed effectively. This is because the ST-VSG makes its virtual inertia increase in the acceleration phase, but makes its virtual inertia equal to zero in the deceleration phase according to (10). The virtual damping is self-tuning to keep a larger value in the whole cycle of oscillation according to (11). As a result, the average active power injected into the system by the ST-VSG is much more than either the CP-VSG or the droop method, as can be seen from Fig.  14 b. From Fig.  14 c, it {{is observed}} that {{with the help of the}} ST-VSG, the DGS presents the lowest average output active power under the step load condition.

The first is a frequency modulated (FM) oscillator that requires only a single low cost ultrahigh frequency operational amplifier.

The oscillator can be calibrated in the static mode and has a negative <b>peak</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> of 400 kHz for a typical rotor blade. High temperature performance tests of the probe and 13 cm of the adjacent cable show good accuracy up to 600 C, the maximum which produces a clearance error of + or - 10 microns at a clearance of 500 microns.

Here, we systematically studied variability in posterior alpha <b>peak</b> <b>frequency</b> both between and within subjects. We recorded brain activity using MEG in 51 healthy human subjects under three experimental conditions — rest, passive visual stimulation and an N-back working memory paradigm, using source reconstruction methods to separate alpha activity from parietal and occipital sources. We asked how alpha <b>peak</b> <b>frequency</b> differed within subjects across cognitive conditions and regions of interest, and looked at the distribution of alpha <b>peak</b> <b>frequency</b> between subjects. In both regions we observed an increase of alpha <b>peak</b> <b>frequency</b> from resting state and passive visual stimulation conditions to the N-back paradigm, with a significantly higher alpha <b>peak</b> <b>frequency</b> in the 2 -back compared to the 0 -back condition. There was a trend for a greater increase in alpha <b>peak</b> <b>frequency</b> during the N-back task in the occipital vs. parietal cortex. The average alpha <b>peak</b> <b>frequency</b> across all subjects, conditions, and regions of interest was 10. 3 Hz with a within-subject SD of 0. 9 Hz and a between-subject SD of 2. 8 Hz. We also measured beta <b>peak</b> <b>frequencies,</b> and except in the parietal cortex during rest, found no indication of a strictly harmonic relationship with alpha <b>peak</b> <b>frequencies.</b> We conclude that alpha <b>peak</b> <b>frequency</b> in posterior regions increases with increasing cognitive demands, and that the alpha rhythm operates across a wider frequency range than the 8 – 12 Hz band many studies tend to include in their analysis. Thus, using a fixed and limited alpha frequency band might bias results against certain subjects and conditions...|$|R

However, the determination of this <b>peak</b> <b>frequency</b> on a spatial scale of a single pixel (8 arc seconds for the GONG data) is limited by the stochastic variations in the power spectrum presumably caused by the stochastic nature of the excitation process.

40|$|An {{automated}} {{modeling system}} for piano sounds is presented. A piano consists of multiple strings and hammers with a soundboard. When a key is pressed, the hammer hits a string and the string resonates at frequencies {{depending on the}} material used, acoustics of the piano from its construction. The system described in this thesis aims to create a simulation sound modeling system to investigate the potential of Perceptual audio quality based modeling of musical instruments. The modeling system {{is based on the}} combination of three main parts: analysis part, synthesis part and audio quality assessment. From recordings of high quality piano sounds taken from sample CDs, the analysis engine filters the original sounds, extracts harmonics peaks that correspond to the resonances of the piano string. The resonances are used to design the string filter, used to "reverse filtering" the original sound and to obtain the excitation signal. The excitation signal physically corresponds to the impact of the hammer on the string. The synthesis part is based on the excitation/filter modeling technique described by Laroche and Mellier and offers an interesting view on piano modeling with a similar flavour to physical modeling (digital waveguide modeling) but still very much based on Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques. The assessment of audio quality, the main novelty of this research project, is based on the Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality (PEAQ) algorithm and ITU recommendation BS. 1387. A series of experiments have been carried out to investigate this novel perceptual audio quality based piano modeling. First, the analysis stage has been improved from the original model to accurately detect the harmonics peaks. On the Synthesis side and the filter design stage, quantisation has been performed on the filter coefficients to assess the <b>peaks</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> and thus audio quality degradation. Experiments on reducing the number and length of excitation signals have also been carried out looking at saving the memory space for future hardware implementation. This data reduction includes: group the excitations of notes that closed together to a common excitation; shorten the excitation signal by applying different windowing functions and interpolating the excitation. For each and every experiment, the degradation of the final audio quality as been assessed so that future model development can focus on directions that are worth improving the audio quality. All the simulations have been carried out under the Matlab environment. The Opticom Opera system of (Opticom GmbH, Germany) was used for the assessment of audio quality. Overall results show that {{only a limited number of}} harmonics is required for top keys (C 5 upwards) but the modeling system has difficulty to model low pitch notes mainly because of the frequency analysis limitations. This could be resolved in the future with special attention to add a soundboard model (post-string processing stage) to reduce the resonance complexity. Filter quantisation is also very sensible as most poles are close to the unit circle and coefficient accuracy seems critical. Excitation signals can be reduced to a certain extent. Common excitation has been investigated with interesting results. More work is still need in this direction for future hardware implementation. It term of data reduction the system is able to reduce several hundreds of MB (original data from CD sample) into a more compact (hundreds of KB) set of data of excitation signals and filter coefficients. Results from this research project will help future implementations onto a multimedia PC as a VST plug-in or a hardware implementation on a Motorola DSP or FPGA chip. Hardware implementation would lead to full piano model for an electronic musical instrument. Perceptual audio quality based modeling improves greatly the optimisation of musical instrument sound model parameters. It is based on PEAQ and thus very sensible to small audio degradation. One can hope to use the results of this research to develop, implement in hardware and evaluate a Grand piano electronic musical instrument...|$|R
