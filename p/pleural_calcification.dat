5000|$|The {{incidence}} of mesothelioma {{has been found}} to be higher in populations living near naturally occurring asbestos. People can be exposed to naturally occurring asbestos in areas where mining or road construction is occurring, or when the asbestos-containing rock is naturally weathered. Another common route of exposure is through asbestos-containing soil, which is used to whitewash, plaster, and roof houses in Greece. In central Cappadocia, Turkey, mesothelioma was causing 50% of all deaths in three small villages—Tuzköy, Karain, and Sarıhıdır. Initially, this was attributed to erionite. Environmental exposure to asbestos has caused mesothelioma in places other than Turkey, including Corsica, Greece, Cyprus, China, and California. In the northern Greek mountain town of Metsovo, this exposure had resulted in mesothelioma incidence around 300 times more than expected in asbestos-free populations, and was associated with very frequent <b>pleural</b> <b>calcification</b> known as [...] "Metsovo Lung".|$|E

40|$|Inhabitants of Metsovo, NW Greece, {{have been}} exposed to an {{asbestos}} whitewash, resulting in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and <b>pleural</b> <b>calcifications</b> (PCs).

They also have lymphocytic alveolitis, and differences in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) proteins, compared with those without <b>pleural</b> <b>calcifications</b> (PC-). This may mean a different response to the fiber leading to different susceptibility to neoplasia. To further evaluate this, a proteomic analysis of BAL proteins was performed. Proteomic analysis (2 D-electrophoresis/Mass Spectrometry) of BAL in Metsovites nonoccupationally exposed to asbestos revealed increased albumin fragments, R 1 -antitrypsin, S 100 -A 9 and HSP 27, suggesting ongoing inflammation.

Pleural mesothelioma presents as pleural thickening, pleural-based nodules, pleural effusion, thickening of interlobular fissures and <b>pleural</b> <b>calcifications.</b> The tumour frequently causes invasion of the chest wall, pericardium, heart and diaphragm. MRI is particularly helpful in detecting chest wall and mediastinal involvement because of the improved soft tissue contrast resolution [70, 71].

40|$|SummaryBackgroundPeritoneal {{mesothelioma}} is a {{very rare}} diagnosis with an incidence of 1 case per 4 – 5 million of the population. It accounts for 20 – 30 % of all mesothelioma type cancers. There is great interest in this disease entity amongst the medical community and indeed the general population due to the well-substantiated link between asbestos related exposure and mesothelioma. Case presentationIn this article we report {{a case of a}} 77 year old man who presented with a one week history of breathlessness and a right pleural effusion. An incidental right upper quadrant abdominal mass was noted leading to ultrasound and subsequent CT scans. A large subhepatic mass was identified, in addition to <b>pleural</b> <b>calcification</b> and thickening. Biopsy and histological examination of the abdominal mass suggested a spindle cell tumour, most likely a mesothelioma. Thoracocentesis and cytology of the pleural fluid confirmed the diagnosis of a malignant mesothelioma. Our patient is a retired dairy farmer. A detailed occupational history revealed likely asbestos exposure when he worked as a plumber, approximately 50 years ago. DiscussionPatients with peritoneal mesothelioma often present late, and as a result treatment is often palliative. Interventions include cytoreductive (debulking) surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

40|$|CONTEXT: Occupational and {{environmental}} exposures to asbestos remain {{a public health}} problem even in developed countries. Because of the long latency in asbestos-related pathology, past asbestos exposure continues to contribute to incident disease. Asbestos most commonly produces pulmonary pathology, with asbestos-related pleural disease as the most common manifestation. Although the pleurae and pericardium share certain histologic characteristics, asbestos-related pericarditis is rarely reported. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 59 -year-old man who worked around boilers for almost 30 years and was eventually determined to have calcific, constrictive pericarditis. He initially presented with an infectious exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Chest radiographs demonstrated <b>pleural</b> and pericardial <b>calcifications.</b> Further evaluation with cardiac catheterization showed a hemodynamic picture consistent with constrictive pericarditis. A high-resolution computerized tomography scan of the chest demonstrated dense calcification in the pericardium, right pleural thickening and nodularity, right <b>pleural</b> plaque without <b>calcification,</b> and density in the right middle lobe. Pulmonary function testing showed mild obstruction and borderline low diffusing capacity. DISCUSSION: Based on the patient’s occupational history, the presence of pleural pathology consisten...|$|R

30|$|Tuberculosis {{is a close}} mimicker of {{melioidosis}} on imaging. Other pyogenic infections {{also share}} some of the imaging characteristics as melioidosis. The lung nodules in melioidosis are commonly larger and irregular. Lung nodules in active tuberculosis are commonly smaller, miliary nodules being typical. In our cohort, we did not encounter isolated lung cavities, though there were cavities within the consolidation. Melioid cavities are thin walled, and air-fluid levels are unusual findings, as compared to tuberculosis [37]. Isolated pleural effusion or <b>pleural</b> <b>calcification</b> could be seen with tuberculosis as well as melioidosis but uncommon in other pyogenic infection. Melioid abscesses in the liver could be larger or smaller. Honeycomb sign is found to be specific for melioidosis [38]. Abscesses in the liver and spleen are not commonly encountered in tuberculosis, whereas they are common with other pyogenic infections. Larger pyogenic abscesses can also demonstrate honeycomb sign, though not specific. Superficial soft tissue abscess along with deep solid visceral organ abscess is common with melioidosis and pyogenic infection, but uncommon with tuberculosis. Superficial soft tissue abscess along with underlying bone or joint infection is common with melioidosis and tuberculosis but uncommon with other pyogenic infections.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundRadiofrequency {{ablation}} has {{became a}} validated technique to cure symptomatic refractory atrial fibrillation (AF). Cardiac computed tomography (CT) {{is used to}} evaluate the left atrial (AT) anatomy in order to improve the ablation technique. The analysis of non-cardiac structures during cardiac CT may identify clinically significant incidental findings (IF). The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence of IF in patients undergoing AF catheter ablation. MethodsBetween February 2006 and March 2010, patients undergoing a procedure of AF or left atrial tachycardia (LAT) ablation were enrolled and underwent a cardiac CT scan. Extracardiac IF were considered to be present if an abnormality was identified without previous clinical suspicion or known disease. Results 250 patients (55. 2 ± 9. 6 years of age, 82. 4 % men) were enrolled (133 paroxysmal, 43 persistent, 58 permanent AF and 16 LAT). Fifty-eight patients (23. 2 %) had a total of 76 IF. Patients with IF were significantly older (59. 5 ± 8. 2 vs 53. 8 ± 9. 7 years old, p< 0. 001). No relationship exist between the type of arrhythmia and the existence of IF. The majority of IF were pulmonary (50 %). Two lung cancers were discovered. ConclusionsCardiac CT scan is a useful tool to evaluate LA and pulmonary veins morphology before AF ablation. However, as a considerable prevalence of IF was found in our study, extracardiac structures should be routinely analyzed to detect unknown diseases.

40|$|Abstract Background Investigation of {{pulmonary}} pathology with {{computed tomography}} also allows visualisation {{of the heart}} and major vessels. We sought to explore whether clinically relevant cardiac pathology could be identified on computed tomography pulmonary angiograms (CTPA) requested for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism (PE). 100 consecutive CT contrast-enhanced pulmonary angiograms carried out for exclusion of PE at a single centre were assessed retrospectively by two cardiologists. Findings Evidence of PE was reported in 5 % of scans. Incidental cardiac findings included: aortic wall calcification (54 %), coronary calcification (46 %), cardiomegaly (41 %), atrial dilatation (18 %), mitral annulus calcification (15 %), right ventricular dilatation (11 %), aortic dilatation (8 %) and right ventricular thrombus (1 %). Apart from 3 (3 %) reports describing cardiomegaly, no other cardiac findings were described in radiologists' reports. Other reported pulmonary abnormalities included: lung nodules (14 %), lobar collapse/consolidation (8 %), pleural effusion (2 %), lobar collapse/consolidation (8 %), emphysema (6 %) and <b>pleural</b> <b>calcification</b> (4 %).

40|$|To {{study the}} {{clinical}} usefulness of computed tomography (CT) scanning of the thorax in asbestos related pleuropulmonary disease, 127 long term asbestos {{workers of the}} mines and mills in the Eastern Townships of Québec were examined. The CT scan was compared with the standard posteroanterior (PA) chest film and the four view films using the ILO grading system for profusion of disease. Six lung areas and six pleural sites were studied. On {{the basis of the}} usual diagnostic criteria, 41 % of the workers had asbestosis. For profusion of parenchymal disease, there was an excellent correlation (r = 0. 96, p less than 0. 001) between PA and four view films and the latter did not significantly increase the total profusion score; the CT scan correlated less well with the PA film (r = 0. 79, p less than 0. 01) and the scatter of the data was larger. In 10 of the 53 (19 %) workers with asbestosis the pulmonary lesions were not recognised by CT scan. For profusion of pleural plaques, there was an excellent correlation (p = 0. 91, p less than 0. 001) between PA and four view films; scores were identical in 73 %, higher for PA in 7 %, and higher for four view films in 19 %. CT scan scores, however, were identical with PA films in 31 %, higher for CT scan in 13 % (owing to higher scores on lateral pleural sites), and lower for CT scan in 56 % (owing to lower scores at diaphragm and costophrenic angle sites). <b>Pleural</b> <b>calcifications</b> were identified in 24 workers for a total of 40 sites; 13 as possible, 31 % identified by two modes, and 27 as definite.

We performed logistic regression analysis to determine the association of image characteristic on chest CT with severe pleural adhesion. Localized pleural thickening was found in 8 patients (6. 5 %), localized <b>pleural</b> <b>calcification</b> in 8 (6. 5 %), pulmonary calcified nodules in 28 (22. 6 %), and active pulmonary inflammation in 22 (17. 7 %). There was no patient with diffuse pleural thickening or calcification in this study. Trivial, mild, and moderate emphysema was found in 31 (25. 0 %), 21 (16. 9 %), and 12 (9. 7 %) patients, respectively. Severe pleural adhesion was found in 31 (25. 0 %) patients. The association of localized pleural thickening or calcification on CT with severe pleural adhesion was not found (P = 0. 405 and 0. 107, respectively). Size of pulmonary calcified nodules and extent of emphysema were significant variables in a univariate analysis (P = 0. 045 and 0. 005, respectively). In a multivariate analysis, moderate emphysema was significantly associated with severe pleural adhesion (odds ratio of 11. 202, P = 0. 001). In conclusion, severe pleural adhesion might be found during lung cancer surgery, provided that preoperative chest CT shows substantial pulmonary calcified nodules or emphysema...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to compare the {{possibilities}} and limitations of direct digital radiography of the chest (DDR), the use of ultrasound of the chest (US) and single slice computed tomography of the chest (CT) in diagnosing pleural mesothelioma. The study was conducted during the course of one year, on 80 patients who were successively referred to a specialized institution, under clinical suspicion of mesothelioma. The method of investigation was the comparison of findings, obtained by the reviewed methods of examination, with the pathohistologic results of a biopsy performed on each patient. The findings that were obtained by the enumerated methods were classified according to the radiologic signs that were found in each individual patient. We evaluated following radiological findings (signs), on each of the investigated methods: plaques, localized and generalized <b>pleural</b> thickenings, <b>calcifications</b> of the pleura, pleural effusions, parapneumonic effusions, pleural empyema, (round) atelectasis, pneumothorax, tumor mass or node, inflammatory infiltrate, elevation of the hemidiaphragm and osteolysis. The results of these were compared with pathohistologic findings and analyzed by means of standard statistical methods. The highest sensitivity was found for CT (94. 4 %), followed by US (92. 6 %), and by DDR (90. 7 %). The highest specificity was obtained with DDR (46. 2 %), followed by CT (35. 5 %) and US (23. 8 %). The comparison of these methods showed 90 % diagnostic accuracy for DDR in relation to CT. CT as an individual method best satisfied most of the criteria for diagnosing mesothelioma. No pathognomonic radiologic sign for mesothelioma was found...|$|R
40|$|Kriteriji za priznavanje prolesionalne azbestoze plućnog parenhima navedeni su u Listi profesionalnih bolesti iz 1983. g. Unatoč tome, invalidske komisije bolest priznaju samo ako zadovoljava nikada ozakonjene Kriterije preporučene u zaključcima radnih sastanaka o azbestozi održavanih u bivšoj Jugoslaviji. Po njima azbestoza se priznaje tek pri prožetosti parenhima supkategorije 2 / 1 i više, ili najmanje supkategorije 1 / 1 uz istodobno obostrano vidljive pleuralne plakove i/ili kalcifikate. U Odjelu {{medicine}} rada Institute za medicinska istraživanja i medicinu rada, Zagreb, učinjene su, i po preporukama Međunarodne organizacije rada iz 1980. g očitane, rendgenske snimke pluća 350 radnika profesionalno izloženih azbestu. U 15 % pregledanih radnika isključena je fibroza pluća. a u 70 % rendgenske snimke opisane su kao »jasno vidljiva fibroza«. Prema Kriterijima, na temelju prožetosti parenhima, azbestoza pluća bila bi obvezno priznata u 4 % pregledanih, u 9 % samo uz istodobno obostrano vidljive plakove ili kalcifikacije pleure. Nasuprot tome, prema Listi profesionalnih bolesti tek 15 % ispitanika nema temelja za priznavanje profesionalne plućne azbestoze, a u 15 % potrebno je drugim metodama azbestozu ili isključiti ili potvrditi. Azbestoza pluća je bolest sui generis i treba je, uz pozitivnu radnu anamnezu, priznati profesionalnom kada je fibroza jasno vidljiva i kada je isključena druga etiologija neosporno dokazane fibroze parenhima. The {{criteria for}} acknowledgement of occupational parenchymal asbestosis were {{set out in}} the List of Occupational Diseases of 1983, under paragraph 26. In spite of this, some occupational health specialists and invalidity committees acknowledge Ihe disease only when it meets the criteria recommended in the Conclusions of a Workshop on Asbestosis, held in former Yugoslavia, although such criteria were never legally implemented. According to these criteria asbestosis of the lung is recognized only when parenchymal profusion is subcategory 2 / 1 and higher, or at least subcategory 1 / 1 with visible pleural plaques and/or bilateral calcifications. In the Department of Occupational Health of the Institute for Medicai Research and Occupational Health in Zagreb chest X-rays were taken and examined in 350 workers occupationally exposed to asbestos. In 51 (15 %) of the workers lung fibrosis was excluded (profusion of the parenchyma was subcategory 0 /-) and in 53 (15 %) fibrosis of the parenchyma could not be excluded or confirmed {{on the basis of the}} X-rays. In the remaining 245 (70 %) the X-rays demonstrated "clearly visible fibrosis" and, depending on the parenchymal profusion, the finding was classified as subcategory 0 / 1 - 2 / 1 and higher, i. e. in 9 % of the workers subcategory 1 / 1 was accompanied by visible bilateral pleuial plaques. According to the Criteria from the Conclusions ol a Workshop, on the basis of parenchymal profusion, asbestosis of the lungs would have to be acknowledged in 4 % of those examined, while in 9 % of the workers with parenchymal profusion of subcategory 1 / 1 or 1 / 2 asbestosis could be acknowledged only if visible bilateral plaques or <b>pleural</b> <b>calcifications</b> were present. On the other hand, according to the List of Occupational Diseases, only 15 % of the examined workers offered no ground for acknowledging occupational parenchymal asbestosis. In another 15 % of the workers additional confirmation would be necessary, based on computerized tomography or histopathological examination, by which parenchymal asbestosis could be confirmed or excluded. Asbestosis of the lungs is a disease sui generis which should, with a positive work history, always be recognized as an occupational disease, after other etiology of the parenchymal fibrosis has been excluded. The extent of parenchymal profusion, other asbestos-related diseases and/or impaired ventilatory or diffusive function of the lungs are not decisive...|$|R
40|$|Around {{the town}} of Cermik in {{south-east}} Turkey there are many deposits of asbestiform minerals, {{some of which are}} used to make whitewash or stucco. A sample of 7000 of the population revealed 461 (6. 5 %) with <b>pleural</b> thickening and <b>calcification,</b> of whom 103 (1. 47 % of the total) had evidence of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Forty-one patients with respiratory cancer were admitted to the Diyarbakir Chest Hospital from around Cermik and from a comparable area of equal population (but without asbestos deposits) in 1977 - 8. Of these 23 were mesotheliomas, 22 coming from around Cermik. In addition, 11 of the 18 primary bronchial cancers came from around Cermik. A similar excess of mesothelioma and bronchial cancer had been admitted from the Cermik area in previous years. The whitewash or stucco material has been shown to contain fibrous tremolite and non-fibrous antigorite/lizardite, chlorite, and talc. A lung biopsy of a patient from Cermik contained large numbers of tremolite fibres, both free and forming asbestos bodies. There were only occasional chrysotile fibres...|$|R
