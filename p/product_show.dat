In this paper we extend these three kinds of products to abstract polytopes and introduce a new product, called the topological product, which also arises in a natural way. We show that these products have unique prime factorization theorems. We use this to compute the automorphism group of a product {{in terms of the}} automorphism groups of the factors and show that (non trivial) products are almost never regular or two-orbit polytopes. We finish the paper by studying the monodromy group of a <b>product,</b> <b>show</b> that such a group is always an extension of a symmetric group, and give some examples in which this extension splits...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{oxidation}} behaviour of three industrial Fe-Cr-Al alloys (with or without yttrium) at temperatures ranging between 1200 and 1350 °C. At 1200 °C, the behaviour of these alloys is improved as the yttrium content rises. However, for temperatures higher or equal to 1300 °C, the presence of yttrium seems to be detrimental. In particular, the distribution of this element in YFe 9 or Y 2 Fe 17 intermetallic particles allows yttrium to diffuse towards {{the surface of the}} product. The high kinetic of this diffusion leads to the formation of oxidized cavities by Kirkendall effect. The results obtained on the 0. 14 %-yttrium <b>product</b> <b>show</b> that the distribution of this element under the oxidized form could help to avoid this damage...|$|E

Assessment of how those properties changed over a storage period of two months was also carried out. The texture analysis results {{that relate to}} large deformations of the <b>product</b> <b>show</b> that the samples were not significantly affected by storage for one month, but subsequent storage for an extra month did result in softer samples. Rheological characterisation shows that upon heating samples become more elastic, however, this behaviour was reversed upon cooling. The rheological behaviour did not change significantly over the two month storage period. Overall results indicate that textural changes are not the limiting factor in the shelf life of this product.
