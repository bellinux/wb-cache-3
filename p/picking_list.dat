40|$|Background Routinely {{collected}} {{general practice}} computer data {{are used for}} quality improvement; poor data quality including inconsistent coding can reduce their usefulness. Objective To document the diversity of data entry systems currently in use in UK general practice and highlight possible implications for data quality. Method General practice volunteers provided screen shots of the clinical coding screen they would use to code a diagnosis or problem title in the clinical consultation. The six clinical conditions examined were: depression, cystitis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, sore throat, tired all the time, and myocardial infarction. We looked at the picking lists generated for these problem titles in EMIS, IPS, GPASS and iSOFT general practice clinical computer systems, using the Triset browser as a gold standard for comparison. Results A mean of 19. 3 codes is offered in the <b>picking</b> <b>list</b> after entering a diagnosis or problem title. EMIS produced the longest picking lists and GPASS the shortest, with a mean number of choices of 35. 2 and 12. 7, respectively. Approximately three-quarters (73. 5 %) of codes are diagnoses, one-eighth (12. 5 %) symptom codes, and the remainder come {{from a range of}} Read chapters. There was no readily detectable consistent order in which codes were displayed. Velocity coding, whereby commonly-used codes are placed higher in the <b>picking</b> <b>list,</b> results in variation between practices even where they have the same brand of computer system. Conclusions Current systems for clinical coding promote diversity rather than consistency of clinical coding. As the UK moves towards an integrated health IT system consistency of coding will become more important. A standardised, limited list of codes for primary care might help address this need...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse {{the impact of}} the yard {{organisation}} on container stowing operations. We deal with the Master Bay Plan problem (MBPP), that consists in stowing containers of different types into available locations on a containership; the aim is to minimise the berthing time {{in such a way that}} structural and operational constraints, related to both the containers and the ship, are satisfied. In particular, we study how the total stowage time changes due to possible reloading operations, when different picking sequences are considered. We use a binary linear programming model for MBPP that has been recently proposed in literature considering two main scenarios. First, we assume to have all containers ready to be loaded on board in the quay independently of their stack position in the yard. In this case, we solve MBPP as it is having as objective function just the minimisation of the loading time. Then, we take into account the yard constraints following the directions of the planning office, which makes the bay plans according to the stocking area requirements and the <b>picking</b> <b>list</b> for the containers to be loaded. In the third case, we present a procedure that enables us to consider different lot arrivals and opportunely relax some constraints. Moreover, we assume that the containers are stored in the yard into different stacks on the basis of their size, destination and weight, depending on the storage strategy chosen by the yard managers. We evaluate alternative yard storage strategies with real size stowage plans of a containership located at a maritime terminal in Genoa. The results show that, when we look for the berthing time minimisation, it is quite important to think about the optimisation of the flow of containers from the yard to the quay.

40|$|Purpose Warehouse {{order picking}} {{has often been}} {{described}} as the most labor-intensive operation in manual warehouses, as well as the most expensive and time consuming. These factors have inevitably become even more crucial due to manufacturing and warehousing recent trends, requiring high flexibility and efficiency in processing orders that are always smaller and needed in very few time. For this reason, in the recent years more efficient and performing systems have been proposed and developed, employing various technological solutions that can support pickers during their work. The aim {{of this study is to}} present a new pick-to-light design solution capable of driving a number of different operators in their picking activities, preventing the possibility of human errors by a new real-time control and alert system. The new solution has been analyzed from a technical and economical point of view, developing also a cost and benefit analysis in comparison with other existing solutions. Design/methodology/approach The most widespread techniques adopted to facilitate picking operations generally rely on led displays or digital screens, voice-activated devices, RFID technology, wireless appliances or lighting systems. As far as the latter are concerned, a pick-to-light system supports the picker during his activities by using different kind of lighting devices that can send evident light signals. In particular, the pick-to-light system here described drives an operator through the various storage locations he has to visit with a set of different coloured lights. These lights can be turned on or off according to the picker’s <b>picking</b> <b>list.</b> Furthermore, they are linked to a control system that it is able to recognize whether the operator is accessing the right storage location or not and to alert him with a set of visual (or also acoustic) signals, preventing him from completing the wrong picking action. A prototype of the new pick-to-light system is under development and implementation too, in order to directly understand its strengths and weaknesses. Originality/value The benefits that such support device can typically provide can be summed up in three main points: - Increased accuracy: picking errors are strongly reduced, since pickers can quickly understand whether they are collecting the right item or not - Increased productivity: picking is made easier and more focused on other activities, and the time needed to look for the right picking location or to remedy errors is reduced - Reduced training: finding the various locations is more intuitive and immediate and pickers don’t have to learn to use complex devices The new presented pick-to-light configuration is designed to be easy-to-use, inexpensive, modular and with a low energy impact. Furthermore, the different coloured lights allow multiple operators to work simultaneously in the same area, as every picker can follow the lights of a specific colour. Finally, comparing this solution with other systems already available on the market, its economic sustainability emerges, making it applicable in every kind of industrial environment...|$|E

30|$|When {{considering}} e-commerce supply chains, the warehousing {{and delivery}} operations {{need to be}} optimised. After (e-commerce) orders are picked in a warehouse, the goods need to be delivered to the preferred delivery location of the customer. Accordingly, order picking and distribution are interrelated. Disruptions in the order picking operations will impact the deliveries. Extensive research {{has already been done}} on the optimization of warehouse operations [8]. However, to obtain more efficient schedules, the order picking and delivery decisions need to be taken at the same time. Such an integrated planning approach leads lower operational costs and/or faster deliveries in comparison with solving both problems separately and sequentially [9]. In the integrated order picking-vehicle routing problem(I-OP-VRP), <b>picking</b> <b>lists</b> and vehicle routes are determined simultaneously. Requirements and constraints of both the order picking problem and the vehicle routing problem are considered at the same time. For example, delivery time windows are taken into account when <b>picking</b> <b>lists</b> are established.|$|R

40|$|Materials {{handling}} is a {{term that}} includes a corporate transport and warehouse processes. Materials handling has impact on the flow of materials and constitute {{a significant part of}} costs. The aim of the thesis is to identify internal transport and warehouse management. The study will clarify the extent of collaboration between production and warehouse affect materials handling. The aim is to suggest approaches to streamline material shipments and inventory management system enhancing interaction between warehouse and production. The study was initiated with a comprehensive survey of the internal inventory management process. This was made by observations and interviews with operators. Continued work in the study included detailed mapping of materials transport, which mainly was done through observations and interviews. The survey showed that the inventory management process was inefficient in terms of time and resources. A major part of Lundqvist’s internal transports were shown to constitute searching for materials. This resulted in the production suffering from impaired supply of materials. Inventory management process was showed to be interference sensitive and very critical for the production. The study resulted in an inventory management system and a layout solution. The inventory management system was designed for using stock cards and <b>pick</b> <b>lists.</b> The inventory cards' feature at the warehouse management process means that documentation is done at each entry and removal from storage. This will result in increased interaction for all organisational units and reduced interference problems. Solutions for <b>pick</b> <b>lists</b> are targeted to streamline the supply of materials to production, which provides a planned supply of materials that enable just-in-time use.

40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} {{two-phase}} model {{for planning and}} scheduling of order picking processes. In many warehousing environments order picking processes are organized according to the pick&pack principle. Pickers must build stabile loads during the picking process under strict time constrains. A genetic algorithm with Pareto elitist-based selection has been developed for this multi-criteria optimization problem. The resulting order <b>pick</b> <b>lists</b> are the input of the scheduling module. Starting times of the lists are determined with simulation optimization techniques considering time constrain, labor and earliness/tardiness penalty costs, and utilization grades. Costs of order picking can reach as high as fifty percent of all warehousing costs. Travel times consume almost half of a complete order picking tour. So {{there is always a}} need to optimize order picking processes...|$|R
