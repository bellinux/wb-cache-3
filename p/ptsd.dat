40|$|Most peroxisomal matrix {{proteins}} {{possess a}} carboxy-terminal tripeptide targeting signal, termed peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (<b>PTS</b> 1), and follow a relatively well-characterized pathway of import into the organelle. The peroxisomal targeting signal type 2 (<b>PTS</b> 2) pathway of peroxisomal matrix protein import is less well understood. In this study, we investigated {{the mechanisms of}} <b>PTS</b> 2 protein binding and import using an optimized in vitro assay to reconstitute the transport events. The import of the <b>PTS</b> 2 protein thiolase differed from <b>PTS</b> 1 protein import in several ways. Thiolase import was slower than typical <b>PTS</b> 1 protein import. Competition experiments with both <b>PTS</b> 1 and <b>PTS</b> 2 proteins revealed that <b>PTS</b> 2 protein import was inhibited by addition of excess <b>PTS</b> 2 protein, but it was enhanced {{by the addition of}} <b>PTS</b> 1 proteins.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{import of}} most intraperoxisomal {{proteins}} is mediated by peroxisome targeting signals at their C-termini (<b>PTS</b> 1) or N-terminal regions (<b>PTS</b> 2). Both signals have been integrated in subcellular location prediction programs. However their present performance, particularly of <b>PTS</b> 2 -targeting {{did not seem}} fitting for large-scale screening of sequences. Results We modified an earlier reported <b>PTS</b> 1 screening method to identify <b>PTS</b> 2 -containing mouse candidates {{using a combination of}} computational and manual annotation. For rapid confirmation of five new <b>PTS</b> 2 - and two previously identified <b>PTS</b> 1 -containing candidates we developed the new cell line CHO-perRed which stably expresses the peroxisomal marker dsRed-PTS 1. Using CHO-perRed we confirmed the peroxisomal localization of <b>PTS</b> 1 -targeted candidate Zadh 2. Preliminary characterization of Zadh 2 expression suggested non-PPARα mediated activation. Notably, none of the <b>PTS</b> 2 candidates located to peroxisomes. Conclusion In a few cases the <b>PTS</b> may oscillate from "silent" to "functional" depending on its surface accessibility indicating the potential for context-dependent conditional subcellular sorting.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the mechanisms of}} peroxisome assembly and the molecular basis of peroxisome assembly disorders, we isolated and characterized a peroxisome-deficient CHO cell mutant, ZP 139, which was found to belong to human complementation group II, the same group as that of our earlier mutant, ZP 105. These mutants had a phenotypic deficiency in the import of peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (<b>PTS</b> 1) proteins. Amino-terminal extension signal (<b>PTS</b> 2) -mediated transport, including that of 3 -ketoacyl coenzyme A thiolase, was also defective in ZP 105 but not in ZP 139. PEX 5 cDNA, encoding the <b>PTS</b> 1 receptor (<b>PTS</b> 1 R), was isolated from wild-type CHO-K 1 cells. <b>PTS</b> 1 R’s deduced primary sequence comprised 595 amino acids, 7 amino acids less than the human homolog, and contained seven tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs at the C-terminal region. Chinese hamster <b>PTS</b> 1 R showed 94, 28, and 24 % amino acid identity with <b>PTS</b> 1 Rs from humans, Pichia pastoris, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively. A <b>PTS</b> 1 R isoform (<b>PTS</b> 1 RL) with 632 amino acid residues was identified in CHO cells; for <b>PTS</b> 1 R, 37 amino acids were inserted between residues at positions 215 and 216 of a shorter isoform (<b>PTS</b> 1 RS).

5|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of benzodiazepines that tolerance to therapeutic effects develops relatively quickly while many adverse effects persist. Tolerance develops to hypnotic and myorelexant effects within days to weeks, and to anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects within weeks to months. Therefore, benzodiazepines {{are unlikely to}} be effective long-term treatments for sleep and anxiety. While BZD therapeutic effects disappear with tolerance, depression and impulsivity with high suicidal risk commonly persist. Several studies have confirmed that long-term benzodiazepines are not significantly different from placebo for sleep or anxiety. This may explain why patients commonly increase doses over time and many eventually take more than one type of benzodiazepine after the first loses effectiveness. Additionally, because tolerance to benzodiazepine sedating effects develops more quickly than does tolerance to brainstem depressant effects, those taking more benzodiazepines to achieve desired effects may suffer sudden respiratory depression, hypotension or death. Most patients with anxiety disorders and <b>PTSD</b> have symptoms that persist for at least several months, making tolerance to therapeutic effects a distinct problem for them and necessitating the need for more effective long-term treatment (e.g., psychotherapy, serotonergic antidepressants).|$|E

40|$|We have {{identified}} a novel peroxisomal targeting sequence (<b>PTS)</b> at the extreme COOH terminus of human catalase. The last four amino acids of this protein (-KANL) are necessary and sufficient to effect targeting to peroxisomes in both human fibroblasts and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, when appended to the COOH terminus of the reporter protein, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase. However, this <b>PTS</b> differs from the extensive family of COOH-terminal <b>PTS</b> tripeptides collectively termed <b>PTS</b> 1 in two major aspects. First, {{the presence of the}} uncharged amino acid, asparagine, at the penultimate residue of the human catalase <b>PTS</b> is highly unusual, in that a basic residue at this position has been previously found to be a common and critical feature of <b>PTS</b> 1 signals. Nonetheless, this asparagine residue appears to constitute {{an important component of the}} catalase <b>PTS,</b> in that replacement with aspartate abolished peroxisomal targeting (as did deletion of the COOH-terminal four residues). Second, the human catalase <b>PTS</b> comprises more than the COOH-terminal three amino acids, in that COOH-terminal-ANL cannot functionally replace the <b>PTS</b> 1 signal-SKL in targeting a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase fusion protein to peroxisomes. The critical nature of the fourth residue from the COOH terminus of the catalase <b>PTS</b> (lysine) is emphasized by the fact that substitution of this residue with a variety of other amino acids abolished or reduced peroxisomal targeting. Targeting was not reduced when this lysine was replaced with arginine, suggesting that a basic amino acid at this position is required for maximal functional activity of this <b>PTS.</b> In spite of these unusual features, human catalase is sorted by the <b>PTS</b> 1 pathway, both in yeast and human cells. Disruption of the PAS 10 gene encoding the S. cerevisiae <b>PTS</b> 1 receptor resulted in a cytosolic location of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase appended with the human catalase <b>PTS,</b> as did expression of this protein in cells from a neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy patient specifically defective in <b>PTS</b> 1 import. Furthermore, through the use of the two-hybrid system, it was demonstrated that both the PAS 10 gene product (Pas 10 p) and the human <b>PTS</b> 1 receptor can interact with the COOH-terminal region of human catalase, but that this interaction is abolished by substitutions at the penultimate residue (asparagine-to- aspartate) and at the fourth residue from the COOH terminus (lysine-to-glycine) which abolish <b>PTS</b> functionality. We have found no evidence of additional targeting information elsewhere in the human catalase protein. An internal tripeptide (-SHL-, which conforms to the mammalian <b>PTS</b> 1 consensus) located nine to eleven residues from the COOH terminus has been excluded as a functional <b>PTS.</b> Additionally, in contrast to the situation for S. cerevisiae catalase A, which contains an internal <b>PTS</b> in addition to a COOH-terminal <b>PTS</b> 1, human catalase lacks such a redundant <b>PTS,</b> as evidenced by the exclusive cytosolic location of human catalase mutated in the COOH-terminal <b>PTS.</b> Consistent with this species difference, fusions between catalase A and human catalase which include the catalase A internal <b>PTS</b> are targeted, at least in part, to peroxisomes regardless of whether the COOH-terminal human catalase <b>PTS</b> is intact...|$|R
