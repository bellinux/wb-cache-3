It is also argued here that a clear conceptualization of <b>Privacy</b> <b>Right</b> will allow for the establishment of legitimate limits in State regulation of the family.

25|$|Currently, as of March 2012, {{the need}} for a set of unified privacy {{policies}} has been met by the European Union with proposed legislation. The Data Protection Regulation is a proposed set of consistent regulations across the European Union that will protect Internet users from clandestine tracking and unauthorized personal data usage. This regulation will further protect users' <b>privacy</b> <b>rights</b> in two key ways: clearly defining the term “personal data” and increasing punishments for those who violate users' online privacy. In Article 4(2) of the proposed legislation, the definition of personal data is expanded significantly to include any information online that could be traced to an individual. In Articles 77 and 79 of the proposed legislation, appropriate punishments are outlined for many possible violations of users' <b>privacy</b> <b>rights</b> by controllers and effective enforcement of data protection is guaranteed. The Data Protection Regulation will also hold companies accountable for violations of the regulation by implementing a unified legislation outlining specific repercussions for various types of violations based on severity.|$|E

In 1950 he led an unsuccessful fight against the “Ober Oath,” one of many “loyalty oaths” directed at libraries put in place by the United States government. However, Greenaway also supported anti-communist measures by the United States and was privately thought by many to be a supporter of Joseph McCarthy. Greenaway argued that one of the main purposes of public access to information was to educate the masses against beliefs he found undesirable, such as communism. One may perhaps surmise that Greenaway was himself politically conservative but nevertheless respected and believed in the value of freedom to information.|$|E
