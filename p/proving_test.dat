5000|$|The {{first of}} the [...] "flying" [...] IAe 33 prototypes, (No. 02) built in 1950, {{completed}} its maiden flight on 27 June of that year, with Captain Edmundo Weiss at the controls. On the second flight, ex-Focke-Wulf test pilot Otto Behrens encountered severe lateral stability problems at speeds over 700 km/h {{and returned to the}} airfield as a precaution. Landing at very high speed, the aircraft bounced with sufficient force to cause the right main undercarriage strut to fail. During repairs to the aircraft, in order to rectify the [...] "tricky" [...] landing characteristics, the front undercarriage strut was increased in length, which served to alter the angle of incidence of the aircraft, while the shock absorbers were adjusted to have a greater [...] "throw". Although never considered docile, the modifications improved the takeoff, landing and low-speed characteristics of the IAe 33. More serious aerodynamic problems persisted, stemming from tip stall— in which the wingtip stalled before the wingroot resulting in an unpredictable [...] "rolling moment"— leading to a change in the wing leading edge near the wingroot, while the rudder was modified in an attempt to resolve the interminable lateral instability issues. In addition, the canopy was reinforced with two external frames and a small fairing was installed above the engine exhaust.Tank, himself a capable development test pilot, took over the test program to investigate the aircraft's stalling characteristics, although the requisite airframe changes took several months to complete, with the Pulqui II N. 02(m) so modified not able to undertake its third proving flight until 23 October. During the ensuing high-altitude test, on two successive occasions, the IAe 33 stalled inadvertently, although Tank had sufficient height at 9,000 m for recovery. Adding ballast to the nose of the aircraft cured the problem. On 8 February 1951, Tank publicly demonstrated the IAe 33 before Perón at the Aeroparque Jorge Newbery in Buenos Aires. The audience also included government officials, legislators and the foreign diplomatic corps in the military attaches of the embassies, along with a large crowd of spectators. Both the IAe 27 Pulqui I and IAe 33 Pulqui II flew during the demonstration.With the successful completion of the <b>proving</b> <b>test</b> flights, the Argentine Air Force requested a pre-production order of 12 IAe 33 aircraft.

This paper investigates these two methods of TIT for synchronous generator rotors.

40|$|A robust {{method has}} been {{developed}} for the test and characterization of analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits. The method relies on a compact, robust, and easily synthesized integrated test core capable of emulating the function of external automatic test equipment. The core consists of a 2 x N memory whose contents are periodically circulated, a coarse analog filter, and a voltage comparator. One half of the circular memory is used to generate analog signals {{without the need for}} multi-bit digital-to-analog converters. The second half is used to generate extremely accurate DC levels, the latter being programmed using a clever software encoding technique that relies on some form of sigma-delta modulation. The DC levels, in combination with the comparator, enable multi-bit digitization using a progressive multiple conversion pass procedure. In order to accommodate broadband circuit phenomena, a delayed-clock sub-sampling mechanism is also employed, in which the digitizer sample clock is consistently delayed over multiple runs of the periodic test signal. One method of delaying the clock is to use a voltage-controlled delay line tuned by a delay-locked loop. The timing resolution of this approach is determined by the value of the consistent clock delay and not its period. A divide-and-conquer approach to the test of deeply embedded analog integrated circuits using the proposed test core is described. Multiple test configurations are presented that can span a wide range of phenomena to be tested both internally to the integrated circuit and externally through I/O interfaces. The applicability of these configurations to increasing test parallelism both at the core and die levels is investigated. Performance limits of the proposed test core are also derived by drawing a comparison to conventional circuits used for data-conversion applications. The same fundamental limitations on integrated circuit performance are shown to affect the test core electronics, although test-specific requirements, such as forcing periodicity and the reliance on software signal processing, help further enhance on-chip measurement accuracy and repeatability. Finally, several successful experimental prototypes that demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach are presented. The prototypes range from concept <b>proving</b> <b>test</b> core integrated circuits to ones containing multiple simultaneously operated test cores and completely embedded circuits under test. In total, several hundred different test cores have been demonstrated, which is further testimony to the practicality of the proposed techniques...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTwo {{sorts of}} lumber drying house {{covered by a}} {{composite}} surface consisting of three layer transparent films and a carbon-fibre sheet (CF-sheet; looks like a semi-opaque) were invented and developed. One of them was built in Ashoro-cho, {{the eastern part of}} Hokkaido, Japan (the first proving site), and the other was built in Asahikawa-shi, the central part of Hokkaido (the second proving site). The dimension of each drying houses is a frontage of 4. 5 m, depth of 5. 0 m and height of 3. 4 m (the 1 st site) and the same frontage and depth as the former, but height of 3. 8 m (the 2 nd site), respectively. Two types of models of the drying house (East-West type and South-North-type) were desinged. The former is shaped like a half Quonset hut and the latter a just Quonset hut. All of the surfaces including the roof and walls except for a north wall of both models are covered by a composite surface. The composite surface is specially consisted by a triple transparent film from upper side and a CF-sheet to bottom side between which there are a few space of air layers. As a result of mutual effect of a spectral radiation properties of the films and the CF-sheet, a total solar radiation incident upon the drying house with cubic body composed of multi-surface from all the sky globally, can be collected into the house as solar rays volumetrically, converted into infrared radiation and trapped inside the drying house as solar heat passively, without any electric power. Moreover, the moist air inside the house being evaporated when drying green lumber can be naturally exhausted through two insulated cylinders (chimney) outside the drying house according to a principle of the thermo-siphon. From these reasons, “An opaque solar lumber drying house covered by a composite surface consisting of a triple-transparent film and a CF-sheet” could be called “A fully passive solar lumber drying house” in other word.
