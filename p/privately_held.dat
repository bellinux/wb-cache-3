5|$|At the time, Monet's {{innovative}} use {{of light}} and color led to its rejection by the Paris Salon of 1869.

5|$|Youngstown's downtown, {{which once}} underscored the community's {{economic}} difficulties, is {{a site of}} new business growth. The Youngstown Business Incubator (YBI), {{in the heart of}} the downtown, houses several start-up technology companies that have received office space, furnishings, and access to utilities. Some companies supported by the incubator have earned recognition, and a few are starting to outgrow their current space. One such company–Turning Technologies–has been rated by Inc. Magazine as the fastest-growing <b>privately</b> <b>held</b> software company in the United States and 18th fastest-growing <b>privately</b> <b>held</b> company overall. In an effort to keep such companies downtown, the YBI secured approval to demolish a row of vacant buildings nearby to clear space for expansion. The project will be funded by a $2 million federal grant awarded in 2006. In 2014, the YBI was ranked as the number 1 university associated business incubator in the world by the Swedish UBII (University Business Incubator Index). In 2015, the YBI was the top University Associated Incubator in North America, and came in second to the Dublin Enterprise & Technology Centre, also known as the Guinness Enterprise Centre, in Dublin.|$|E

5|$|TouchWave, Inc. (now WebCom), was a <b>privately</b> <b>held</b> Palo Alto, California IP-telephony {{network switch}} {{provider}} founded in 1997. TouchWave developed a product line called WebSwitch {{that was designed}} to replace traditional private telephone exchange systems in small-to-medium-sized companies. WebSwitch was part of a phone system that incorporates communication features provided by the Internet. The rapid success of TouchWave was memorialized with awards and an acquisition by Ericsson Communications for $46M two years after TouchWave was founded. Ericsson continued the TouchWave product line under the name WebCom, but its efforts have been viewed as less than successful.|$|E

5|$|Although ferries (and later bridges) {{had crossed}} the river to the east at Richmond since 1459 and to the west at Eel Pie Island since at least 1652 the lands {{to the south of}} the river at this point had {{historically}} been <b>privately</b> <b>held</b> by the Tollemache family (owners of Ham House) and off limits to the public. Consequently, despite the distance from the nearest crossings there was little demand for cross-river services at this location. Additionally, the Tollemache family had licensing rights for the Twickenham Ferry at Eel Pie Island (sometimes known as Dysart's ferry after the family), and consequently had little interest in promoting a competing service. The Twickenham Ferry is a setting for some action in Little Dorritt by Charles Dickens.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, SAS {{was one of}} Inc. Magazine's {{fastest growing}} {{companies}} in America from 1979 and 1985. It grew more than ten percent per year from $10 million in revenues in 1980 to $1.1 billion by 2000. In 2007, SAS revenue was $2.15 billion, and in 2013 its revenue was $3.02 billion. By the late 1990s, SAS was the largest <b>privately</b> <b>held</b> software company. The Associated Press reported that analysts attributed the growth to aggressive R spending. It had the highest ratio of its revenues spent on R in the industry for eight years, setting a record of 34 percent of its revenues in 1993, as it {{was working on a}} new menu-based interface. The company began its relationship with Microsoft and development for Windows operating systems in 1989. Shortly afterwards it established partnerships with database companies like Oracle, Sybase and Informix.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, TouchWave was a <b>privately</b> <b>held,</b> venture-backed startup {{company in}} Palo Alto, California, with future {{entrepreneur}} Oliver Muoto as its marketing director. Co-founded by CEO Bo Larsson, Jeff Snider, David F. Wittenkamp, and Jesper Stroe, TouchWave released its first product, WebSwitch, in 1997. WebSwitch, a Web-based phone switch, provided telephony over IP and targeted small to medium-sized businesses and branch networks of larger organizations. The WebSwitch {{was designed to}} deliver significantly lower costs for communications, ease of management and administration and offered services on a single IP-based network platform. The timing of TouchWave's late 1997 release of its phone switch product matched Level 3's development of its first softswitch, a method to connect calls from one phone line to another without a need to use traditional hardware.|$|E

5|$|The first {{healthcare}} structure, the Santa Casa da Misericórdia da Póvoa de Varzim (Holy House of Mercy), {{opened in}} 1756. The hospitals {{of the city}} are the São Pedro Pescador Hospital (state-run) in Largo das Dores and the <b>privately</b> <b>held</b> Hospital da Luz Póvoa de Varzim (notable private hospital previously known as Clipóvoa) in Rua Manuel I street. The public hospital suffers from lack of bed spaces. Due to this, it underwent expansion works {{and there is an}} ongoing plan to build a modern hospital in the border between the cities of Póvoa de Varzim and Vila do Conde, to serve the population of both municipalities. The Centro de Saúde da Póvoa de Varzim (Health Centre) is a public primary care building which has extensions in the main suburbs.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} declining {{interest}} rates, combined with excess liquidity continually {{provided by the}} ECB, {{made it easier for}} banks within the countries in which interest rates fell the most, and their linked sovereigns, to borrow significant amounts (above the 3% of GDP budget deficit imposed on the eurozone initially) and significantly inflate their public and private debt levels. Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, governments in these countries found it necessary to bail out or nationalise their <b>privately</b> <b>held</b> banks to prevent systemic failure of the banking system when underlying hard or financial asset values were found to be grossly inflated and sometimes so near worthless there was no liquid market for them. This further increased the already high levels of public debt to a level the markets began to consider unsustainable, via increasing government bond interest rates, producing the ongoing European sovereign-debt crisis.|$|E
5|$|During the 1650s, Ashmole {{devoted a}} great deal of energy to the study of alchemy. In 1650, he {{published}} Fasciculus Chemicus under the anagrammatic pseudonym James Hasolle. This work was an English translation of two Latin alchemical works, one by Arthur Dee, the son of John Dee. In 1652, he published his most important alchemical work, Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum, an extensively annotated compilation of metaphysical poems in English. The book preserved and made available many works that had previously existed only in <b>privately</b> <b>held</b> manuscripts. A corrected edition using Ashmole's two errata sheets and the additional chapter seven of a piece by Thomas Charnock was published in 2011. There is little evidence that Ashmole conducted his own alchemical experiments. He {{appears to have been a}} collector of alchemical writings and a student of alchemy rather than an active practitioner, and refers to himself as a pupil of William Backhouse. His final alchemical publication was The Way to Bliss in 1658, but thereafter his interest seems to wane in favour of his other pursuits. Ashmole promoted the use of therapeutic remedies drawing on both Galenic and Paracelsian principles, and his works attempt to merge the two schools. The Way to Bliss recommends ways to prevent illness: a balanced diet, moderate exercise and enough sleep. His works were avidly studied by other natural philosophers, such as Isaac Newton.|$|E
