25|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} convert {{malic acid}} into lactic acid as an indirect means of creating {{energy for the}} bacteria by chemiosmosis which uses the difference in <b>pH</b> <b>gradient</b> between inside the cell and outside in the wine to produce ATP. One model on how this is accomplished notes that the form of L-malate most present at the low pH of wine is its negatively charged monoanionic form. When the bacteria move this anion from the wine into higher pH level of its cellular plasma membrane, it causes a net-negative charge that creates electrical potential. The decarboxylation of malate into L-lactic acid releases not only carbon dioxide, but also a proton that generates the <b>pH</b> <b>gradient</b> which can produce ATP.|$|E
25|$|A common {{technique}} {{is to use}} an Immobilized <b>pH</b> <b>gradient</b> (IPG) in the first dimension. This {{technique is}} referred to as IPG-DALT. The sample is first separated onto IPG gel (which is commercially available) then the gel is cut into slices for each sample which is then equilibrated in SDS-mercaptoethanol and applied to an SDS-PAGE gel for resolution in the second dimension. Typically IPG-DALT is not used for quantification of proteins due to the loss of low molecular weight components during the transfer to the SDS-PAGE gel.|$|E
25|$|While {{cultivating}} D. discoidium in a laboratory, it {{is important}} to take into account its behavioral responses. For example, it has an affinity toward light, higher temperatures, high humidity, low ionic concentrations, and the acidic side of the <b>pH</b> <b>gradient.</b> Experiments are often done to see how manipulations of these parameters hinder, stop, or accelerate development. Variations of these parameters can alter the rate and viability of culture growth. Also, the fruiting bodies, being that this is the tallest stage of development, are very responsive to air currents and physical stimuli. It is unknown if there is a stimulus involved with spore release.|$|E
40|$|The {{transport}} of protons across liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine {{in response to}} electrical potentials or <b>pH</b> <b>gradients</b> has been investigated. The results support three major conclusions. The first of these concerns the need for reliable measurements of electrical potentials and <b>pH</b> <b>gradients.</b> It is shown that the potential probe tetraphenylphosphonium and the pH probe methylamine provide accurate and self consistent measures of electrical potentials and <b>pH</b> <b>gradients</b> respectively in these systems. Second, it is shown by two independent techniques that the <b>pH</b> <b>gradients</b> induced in response to valinomycin and potassium dependent electrical potentials are significantly smaller than would be expected for electrochemical equilibrium. The <b>pH</b> <b>gradients</b> observed are stable over an 8 h time course and {{are sensitive to the}} ionic composition of the buffers employed, where the presence of external sodium results in the smallest induced <b>pH</b> <b>gradients.</b> These results are discussed in terms of current models of proton conductance across membranes. In a final area of investigation, it is shown that valinomycin and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) can transport sodium ions in a synergistic manner...|$|R
40|$|The {{polymorphism}} of transferrin (Tf) {{is currently}} being studied by isoelectric focusing in carrier ampholyte-generated <b>pH</b> <b>gradients,</b> carrier ampholyte-separator <b>pH</b> <b>gradients</b> or in immobilized <b>pH</b> <b>gradients.</b> Details for obtaining reproducible results {{with each of the}} three procedures are outlined. The effectiveness of pretreatment of serum samples with ferrous/ferric salts is discussed, and incubation times optimized after spectrophotometric measurement of the monoferric Tf conversion. Most of the presently available commercial batches of carrier ampholytes do not reliably discriminate the six common TfC subtypes. Resolution of C 1, C 3 and C 2 was achieved by adding 20 to 90 mM HEPES slab gels prepared with various carrier ampholytes. Isoelectric focusing in carrier ampholyte-separator <b>pH</b> <b>gradients</b> cannot be recommended as a standard typing procedure because the results strongly depend on the batch of carrier ampholytes. Tf subtype resolution was only achieved by using isoelectric focusing in immobilized <b>pH</b> <b>gradients</b> with <b>pH</b> slopes reliably reproducible from one experiment to another. Two major shortcomings of immobilized <b>pH</b> <b>gradients</b> are a marked tendency to protein precipitation at the application site and an interaction of proteins with the charged matrix. A protocol for Tf subtyping in immobilized <b>pH</b> <b>gradients</b> is described, based on prior desialylation of samples instead of pretreatment with iron. Sample entry into the matrix was optimized by addition of 5 mM Tris to the gels, and initially running them at low voltage. Recommendations are provided for the application of Tf typing for paternity testing...|$|R
40|$|Summary: We {{present a}} new method for {{analysis}} of haemoglobin variants in immobilized <b>pH</b> <b>gradients.</b> The isoelectric fractionation is performed in polyacrylamide gels with copolymerized <b>pH</b> <b>gradients</b> between <b>pH</b> 7. 0 and 8. 0. The common haemoglobin variants (HbA, HbF, HbS, HbC, HbE and HbA 2) are clearly resolved within this pH range. The high resolving power and reproducibility of immobilized <b>pH</b> <b>gradients</b> combined with extremely short separation times make this fractionation technique superior to all electrokinetic procedures used for haemoglobin analysis. At present, isoelectric focusing in immobilized <b>pH</b> <b>gradients</b> is a complementary tool for haemoglobin analysis when classical electrophoretic techniques do not provide sufficient resolution. We hope {{that in the future}} this technique will gain the popularity it deserves...|$|R
25|$|Thylakoid {{proteins}} {{are targeted}} to their destination via signal peptides and prokaryotic-type secretory pathways inside the chloroplast. Most thylakoid proteins encoded by a plant's nuclear genome need two targeting signals for proper localization: An N-terminal chloroplast targeting peptide (shown in yellow in the figure), {{followed by a}} thylakoid targeting peptide (shown in blue). Proteins are imported through the translocon of outer and inner membrane (Toc and Tic) complexes. After entering the chloroplast, the first targeting peptide is cleaved off by a protease processing imported proteins. This unmasks the second targeting signal and the protein is exported from the stroma into the thylakoid in a second targeting step. This second step requires the action of protein translocation components of the thylakoids and is energy-dependent. Proteins are inserted into the membrane via the SRP-dependent pathway (1), the Tat-dependent pathway (2), or spontaneously via their transmembrane domains (not shown in figure). Lumenal proteins are exported across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen by either the Tat-dependent pathway (2) or the Sec-dependent pathway (3) and released by cleavage from the thylakoid targeting signal. The different pathways utilize different signals and energy sources. The Sec (secretory) pathway requires ATP as energy source and consists of SecA, which binds to the imported protein and a Sec membrane complex to shuttle the protein across. Proteins with a twin arginine motif in their thylakoid signal peptide are shuttled through the Tat (twin arginine translocation) pathway, which requires a membrane-bound Tat complex and the <b>pH</b> <b>gradient</b> as an energy source. Some other proteins are inserted into the membrane via the SRP (signal recognition particle) pathway. The chloroplast SRP can interact with its target proteins either post-translationally or co-translationally, thus transporting imported proteins {{as well as those}} that are translated inside the chloroplast. The SRP pathway requires GTP and the <b>pH</b> <b>gradient</b> as energy sources. Some transmembrane proteins may also spontaneously insert into the membrane from the stromal side without energy requirement.|$|E
25|$|Anthrax toxin protein {{components}} must assemble into holotoxin complexes to function. In {{order for}} LF and EF to function inside a target cell, they must localize {{to the cell}} and enter its cytoplasm. Through a series of steps, PA can translocate EF and LF into the cell (Fig. 2). This process starts when the 83-kDa form of PA, called PA83, binds to an anthrax toxin receptor. There are two known homologous receptors, which bind to PA83, called tumor endothelium marker-8 (TEM8) and capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2). Then a 20 kDa fragment (PA20) is cleaved off PA83's amino terminus by membrane endoproteases from the furin family. When PA20 dissociates, the remaining receptor-bound portion of PA, called PA63, may assemble into either a heptameric or octameric ring-shaped oligomer. This ring-shaped oligomer {{is often referred to}} as the pre-pore (or pre-channel) form of PA, since later in the pathway it will become a translocase pore (or channel). The surface of the pre-pore oligomer, which was exposed upon release of the PA20 moiety, can then bind to LF and EF. The heptameric and octameric forms of the PA oligomer may then bind with up to three or four molecules of EF and/or LF, respectively. The cell then endocytoses these assembled complexes and carries them to an acidic compartment in the cell. The low pH encountered in the endosome causes the PA63 pre-channel to convert into a cation-selective channel. EF and LF are driven through the channel by a <b>pH</b> <b>gradient,</b> allowing the enzyme factors to enter the cytosol.|$|E

These sera were analyzed {{for the presence}} of individual clonotypes of specific antitetanus or antimicrococcal antibodies by isoelectric focusing in immobilized <b>pH</b> <b>gradients</b> with added carrier ampholytes followed by affinity immunoblotting. The affinity immunoblots obtained clearly defined both the rapid disappearance and late appearance of distinct subsets of antibody clonotypes during the response.

500|$|In {{oxidative}} phosphorylation, {{the passage}} of electrons from NADH and FADH2 through the electron transport chain pumps protons out of the mitochondrial matrix and into the intermembrane space.

500|$|To {{avoid the}} acidic {{environment}} of {{the interior of the}} stomach (lumen), H. pylori uses its flagella to burrow into the mucus lining of the stomach to reach the epithelial cells underneath, where it is less acidic. [...] H. pylori is able to sense the <b>pH</b> <b>gradient</b> in the mucus and move towards the less acidic region (chemotaxis). [...] This also keeps the bacteria from being swept away into the lumen with the bacteria's mucus environment, which is constantly moving from its site of creation at the epithelium to its dissolution at the lumen interface.|$|E
500|$|The energy {{released}} by electrons flowing through this electron transport chain {{is used to}} transport protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, in a process called electron transport. This generates potential {{energy in the form}} of a <b>pH</b> <b>gradient</b> and an electrical potential across this membrane. This store of energy is tapped when protons flow back across the membrane and down the potential energy gradient, through a large enzyme called ATP synthase; this process is known as chemiosmosis. The [...] ATP synthase uses the energy to transform adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into adenosine triphosphate, in a phosphorylation reaction. The reaction is driven by the proton flow, which forces the rotation of a part of the enzyme; the ATP synthase is a rotary mechanical motor.|$|E

40|$|Liposome {{permeability}} to net proton-hydroxide flux {{was compared}} under two conditions that have produced extreme values in previous studies. In the first [Nichols, J. W. & Deamer, D. W.

We have repeated the conditions of the latter study and have found that the decay of large <b>pH</b> <b>gradients</b> produces a diffusion potential that limits net proton-hydroxide flux. The permeability coefficients calculated from the flux are therefore underestimated and do not reflect intrinsic proton permeability.

2500|$|Yeast {{transport}} {{amino acids}} and small peptides (less than 5 amino acid residues) {{into the cell}} via an active transport process that utilizes specialized membrane proteins and {{the difference in the}} <b>pH</b> <b>gradient</b> of the acidic wine solution (pH between 3-4) and the near neutral pH of cytoplasm inside the yeast cells. The proton symport proteins in the membrane take in the amino acid coupled with a hydrogen ion that later gets expelled by the cell via a hydrogen ion pump. This is an energy dependent process that becomes more energetically unfavorable for the yeast cell as fermentation progressed and ethanol levels increase, creating [...] "passive leakage" [...] of excess hydrogen ions into the cell. The cell's hydrogen ion pumps have to work even harder to maintain its internal pH so it sends a signal to the symport proteins to stop bringing other ions.

The axial variation of the channel cross-sectional area will induce non-uniform Joule heating and set up temperature gradient, which will generate pH gra-dient when proper medium is used. In order to operationally control the thermally generated <b>pH</b> <b>gradients,</b> fundamental understanding of heat transfer phenomena in microfluidic chips with diverging microchannels must be improved. In this paper, two 3 -D numerical models are presented to study heat transfer in diverging microchannels, with static and moving liquid, respectively. Through simulation, the temperature dis-tribution for the entire chip has been revealed, including both liquid and solid regions. The model for the static liquid scenario has been compared with published results for validation. Parametric studies have showed that the channel geometry has significant effects on the peak temperature location, and the electrical conductivity of the medium and the wall boundary convection have effects on the generated temperature gra-dients and thus the generated <b>pH</b> <b>gradients.</b> The solution to the continuous flow model, where the medium convection is considered, shows that liquid convection has signifi-cant effects on temperature distribution and the peak temperature location...|$|R

The immobilized <b>pH</b> <b>gradient</b> is {{obtained by the}} continuous change in the ratio of Immobilines. An Immobiline is a weak acid or base defined by its pK value. Immobilized pH gradients (IPG) are made by mixing two kinds of acrylamide mixure, one with Immobiline having acidic buffering property and other with basic buffering property. The concentrations of the buffers in the two solutions define the range {{and shape of the}} <b>pH</b> <b>gradient</b> produced. Both solutions contain acrylamide monomers and catalysts. During polymerization, the acrylamide portion of the buffers co polymerize with the acrylamide and bisacrylamide monomers to form a polyacrylamide gel. These polymerised gels are backed with plastic based backing that allow ease in handling and improve IPG's performance. The gel is then washed to remove catalysts and unpolymerized monomers, which interfere with isoelectric separation. IPG increased reproducibility of Isoelectric focusing and 2D-Gel Electrophoresis. Other advantages are increased resolution, reproducible separation of alkaline proteins and increased loading capacity (up to 10 mg).|$|E

Failure of this repair process is characteristic of neurodegeneration in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, and it remains unclear how the lesion microenvironment contributes to decreased remyelination potential of oligodendrocytes. Here, we show that acidic extracellular pH, which is characteristic of demyelinating lesions, decreases the migration, proliferation, and survival of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), and reduces their differentiation into oligodendrocytes. Further, OPCs exhibit directional migration along <b>pH</b> <b>gradients</b> toward acidic <b>pH.</b> These in vitro findings support a possible in vivo scenario whereby <b>pH</b> <b>gradients</b> attract OPCs toward acidic lesions, but resulting reduction in OPC survival and motility in acid decreases progress toward demyelinated axons and is further compounded by decreased differentiation into myelin-producing oligodendrocytes.
