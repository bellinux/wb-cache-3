5|$|Manchester City elected not to <b>parade</b> {{the trophy}} at the match {{as they did}} not wish to be seen as 'crass' in front of the visiting Stoke City supporters. Instead, Manchester City were invited by Manchester City Council to host an open-top bus <b>parade</b> through the City of Manchester in celebration of their victory. The <b>parade</b> took place on 23 May 2011 and began at 18:00 {{starting}} at Albert Square outside Manchester Town Hall where 10,000 people were present to see the team set off on the bus <b>parade</b> with various streets of the city centre closed by 12:00 in preparation for the <b>parade.</b> The open-top bus then travelled out of Manchester city centre via Princess Street, Portland Street, Piccadilly Gardens, Newton Street on onto Great Ancoats Street. The <b>parade</b> finally reached Ashton New Road where thousands supporters were waiting at the gates of the City of Manchester Stadium to welcome the team home. The <b>parade</b> culminated in a special reception at the stadium, where 40,000 who claimed free tickets for the event were waiting. Greater Manchester Police estimated that the <b>parade</b> attracted a crowd in excess of 100,000.|$|E

5|$|On April 16, 2010, the {{day prior}} to the annual Vaisakhi <b>Parade</b> held in Surrey, B.C., one of the <b>parade</b> {{organizers}} issued a statement indicating should Dosanjh and BC Liberal backbencher Dave Hayer choose to attend the <b>parade,</b> their safety could not be guaranteed. This was {{due in part to}} comments that Dosanjh had made after the <b>parade</b> in 2007, suggesting a police investigation into reports of a <b>parade</b> float that had a picture of Talwinder Singh Parmar on it, the alleged mastermind behind the bombing of Air India Flight 182. Dosanjh also expressed concerns over some attendees wearing International Sikh Youth Federation T-shirts, a terrorist organization that is banned in India, Britain, the United States, and Canada.|$|E

The <b>parades</b> are not street <b>parades,</b> but military <b>parades</b> consisting of ceremonial pomp that are symbolic of Marine professionalism, discipline, and esprit de corps.|$|R
50|$|Other <b>parades</b> {{have been}} held on {{important}} days during and close to Lent. An example {{can be found in}} today's <b>parades</b> on Mardi Gras.

5|$|The Ypsilanti Heritage Festival <b>Parade</b> {{began in}} 1979, {{and has been}} held every year. In 2007, the <b>parade</b> {{attracted}} wider attention when <b>parade</b> organizers approved {{the inclusion of a}} group protesting a proposed city income tax and subsequently revoked the permission. Festival coordinators explained that their rule was to exclude groups marching to represent controversial or political issues, and that the initial approval was an error.|$|E
50|$|According to the <b>Parades</b> Commission, a {{total of}} 3405 <b>parades</b> (not {{counting}} funerals) were held in Northern Ireland in 2007. The following table groups these <b>parades</b> by type and sponsoring organisation.|$|R
50|$|One of the position's more {{problematic}} duties was responsibility for <b>parades</b> in Northern Ireland under the Special Powers Act and from 1951 the Public Order Act. <b>Parading</b> was (and is) extremely contentious in Northern Ireland, {{and so the}} Minister was bound to anger one community or other regardless of what decision he made. Ministers generally allowed <b>parades</b> by the Orange Order and other Protestant groups to go where they wanted, while restricting nationalist <b>parades</b> to Catholic areas and banning republican or anti-partitionist <b>parades.</b> Communist and other far-left <b>parades</b> were also sometimes banned. From time to time Ministers, for example Brian Maginess, attempted to administer the <b>parading</b> issue more fairly, but usually suffered career damage as a result. The <b>parading</b> issue may be {{the reason why the}} Home Affairs portfolio changed hands more often than most other Ministerial positions.|$|R
2500|$|After the {{partition}} of Ireland in 1921, the Northern Ireland Government's policy tended to favour Protestant and unionist <b>parades.</b> From 1922 to 1950, almost 100 <b>parades</b> and meetings were banned under the Special Powers Act – nearly all were Irish nationalist or republican. Although violence died down during this period, there were clashes at the 1931 and 1950 Drumcree <b>parades.</b> The Public Order Act 1951 exempted [...] "traditional" [...] <b>parades</b> from having to ask police permission, but [...] "non-traditional" [...] <b>parades</b> could be banned or re-routed without appeal. Again, the legislation tended to benefit Protestant <b>parades.</b>|$|R
5|$|The inaugural <b>parade</b> route {{ran along}} Pennsylvania Avenue,N.W. from the U.S.Capitol, ending {{at the north}} face of the White House. During most of the <b>parade,</b> President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama {{traveled}} in the new armored limousine because of potential security threats. The President and First Lady twice exited their limousine, walking on Pennsylvania Avenue for portions of the <b>parade.</b> Vice President Biden and his wife Jill walked the <b>parade</b> route at several points with their children Beau, Hunter and Ashley.|$|E
5|$|A {{ceremony}} of dedication {{was held on}} the afternoon of October 28, 1886. President Grover Cleveland, the former New York governor, presided over the event. On the morning of the dedication, a <b>parade</b> was held in New York City; {{estimates of the number of}} people who watched it ranged from several hundred thousand to a million. President Cleveland headed the procession, then stood in the reviewing stand to see bands and marchers from across America. General Stone was the grand marshal of the <b>parade.</b> The route began at Madison Square, once the venue for the arm, and proceeded to the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan by way of Fifth Avenue and Broadway, with a slight detour so the <b>parade</b> could pass in front of the World building on Park Row. As the <b>parade</b> passed the New York Stock Exchange, traders threw ticker tape from the windows, beginning the New York tradition of the ticker-tape <b>parade.</b>|$|E

50|$|Every Twelfth between 1970 and 2005, British Army {{soldiers}} were deployed in Belfast to help police the <b>parades.</b> Due to improved policing, dialogue between marchers and residents, and the Northern Ireland peace process, <b>parades</b> have been generally more peaceful since the 2000s. The <b>Parades</b> Commission {{was set up}} in 1998 to deal with contentious <b>parades.</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>Parading</b> is a {{controversial}} issue in Northern Ireland. In general debates centre {{on the route}} of particular parades; people from one community often object to <b>parades</b> by [...] "the other side" [...] passing through or near [...] "their" [...] area, for example Orange Order <b>parades</b> marching through mainly nationalist or republican areas(see http://orangecitadel.blogspot.com/) A few <b>parades</b> are seen as objectionable regardless of route. These involve or commemorate paramilitary groups, such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army and Ulster Defence Association, and otherwise non-controversial <b>parades</b> have sometimes caused conflict because of a band or lodge carrying a banner or flag associated with a paramilitary group. Gay pride <b>parades</b> have also been controversial.|$|R
50|$|To ensure {{fairness}} and reliability, {{there are certain}} recognised procedures for identity <b>parades.</b> The police also have standing rules to govern identity-parade procedures. Nowadays identity <b>parades</b> are often videotaped to minimise disputes about what occurred in or was established by them. Some specially-fitted identity-parade rooms have one-way glass so that witnesses do not feel intimidated by confrontation with possible suspects. Sometimes identity <b>parades</b> are not possible or feasible, in which case photo <b>parades</b> take place. For the suitable conditions for photo <b>parades,</b> see S v Ndika.|$|R
5|$|During {{their two}} years at Valley <b>Parade,</b> the Bradford Bulls {{recorded}} their highest attendance on 4 March 2001 against St. Helens with a crowd of 16,572.

50|$|The {{majority}} of <b>parades</b> in Northern Ireland (nearly 70% in 2003/4) are organised by Protestant and/or unionist groups, leading {{some people to}} view attempts to restrict <b>parades</b> as an attack on Protestant and/or unionist culture. <b>Parades</b> typically take place on Saturdays, which means that participants and spectators {{do not have to}} take time off work, and avoid <b>parading</b> on Sunday, which some Protestants believe should only be spent on purely religious activities. The only exceptions to this are the Twelfth of July <b>parades,</b> which are held on the same date each year, (unless the 12th falls on a Sunday, in which case it is postponed to Monday the 13th), and church <b>parades,</b> which are held on Sunday.|$|R
50|$|Military {{brass and}} reed bands perform as a marching band in <b>parades,</b> {{military}} <b>parades,</b> or seated, in concert, {{and play a}} part in military funeral, convocation, ceremonies such as Trooping the Colour, and <b>parades.</b> They participate in community events such as Remembrance Day <b>parades</b> and band concerts. These bands wear a mix of standard military service dress (either battle dress, DEU or shirtsleeves) and Highland dress as appropriate.|$|R
