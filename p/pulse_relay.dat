40|$|In this thesis, relay {{control is}} applied {{to a pair of}} {{antagonistic}} Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuators for rapid and accurate regulation and tracking of position and force. Similar control is applied for the attenuation of impulse disturbances in the case of vibration isolation. When SMA actuators are used in an antagonistic configuration, relay control has the advantage that the SMA hysteresis is not a concern. This provides a major simplification for the modelling and control of SMA devices. Force and position models for the SMA actuators relevant to control are proposed. Both models are based on a theoretically derived current-stress model for a single SMA fiber. The models are sufficiently true to the original system that control design can be done in simulation and the resultant controllers applied to the actual system without tuning. Three applications are explored in this work: force control, position control, and impulse disturbance attenuation for vibration isolation. Both the step response and tracking are examined for the constrained force control using a two stage multi-relay controller that switches on the sign of the error. The same two stage controller is used to control position and examine the effects of varying the load on the system. As the applied load increases, the limit cycle magnitude increases, greatly diminishing the accuracy of the response. A position/velocity relay controller is proposed to reduce the limit cycle magnitude to a low level, subject to sensing and sampling rate limitations, even with a difficult undamped inertial load. For vibration isolation, an acceleration/jerk <b>pulse</b> <b>relay</b> controller is presented that rapidly attenuates an impulse disturbance. The presented experimental results set a new standard for accurate and rapid control of SMA devices...|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 22 - 25, 1984 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaA {{system has}} been {{developed}} to simultaneously sample and transmit digital data from five remote geophysical data receiver stations to a control station that processes, displays, and stores the data. A microprocessor in each remote station receives commands from the control station over a single telemetry channel. The commands adjust the sensing amplifier’s input voltage range (1 microvolt to 2 volts peak-to-peak), the number of samples (128 to 30, 000), the sampling rate (256 to 32, 768 samples/sec), {{and the number of}} signals (1 to 16) to average at the remote stations. A 12 bit analog-to-digital converter samples data with bandwidths of 100 Hz to 10 kHz for time periods selected from 100 seconds to 1 second, respectively. Each remote station begins sampling geophysical signals when it receives a synchronizing <b>pulse</b> <b>relayed</b> from the control station. Digitized geophysical data is transmitted to the control station over broadband (100 kHz bandwidth) UHF telemetry channels using standard asynchronous serial (19. 2 kbaud) techniques and hardware dropout detection and recovery. The amount of data (480 kbits) and the maximum time to transmit data (30 secs) dictate using broadband telemetry (even though most geophysical telemetry is less than 10 kHz in bandwidth). Header information (transmitted before the data) contains station number, digital sampling parameters, transmission block size, and checksum. This information is used by a computer program (in a PDP- 11 / 23 (***) minicomputer) to maintain up to 5 simultaneous Direct Memory Access (DMA) transfers from the remote stations into 5 separate data buffers. Filled buffers are transfered (via an IEEE- 488 bus) to an interactive analysis and display system (HP 9845 C (***)) for selecting data to be stored on magnetic media for subsequent laboratory analysis...|$|R

In conditions of poor peripheral perfusion such as hypotension, hypothermia, and vasoconstriction, pulse oximeters become inaccurate or provide no reading. This {{is due to the}} poor quality of the PPG signals detected at that instance. In order to overcome this problem, the ear canal has been proposed as a alternative measurement site for measuring reliable SpO 2. Hence, an ear canal PPG sensor was developed along with a PPG processing system. The performance of the sensor was evaluated by measuring the red and infrared PPGs and SpO 2 from 10 healthy volunteers undergoing artificially induced hypothermia. The results from the ear canal sensor were compared with simultaneously acquired results from the finger. Hypothermia was induced by exposing the volunteers to cold temperatures of 10 ± 1 °C. The results acquired suggest that the ear canal pulse oximeter endures more in estimating SpO 2 values accurately when compared with the more common finger pulse oximeter...|$|R

40|$|We propose {{wireless}} sensor networks {{composed of}} nodes using low-power 802. 15. 4 radios as an enabling technology for patient monitoring in general hospital wards. A key challenge for such applications is to reliably deliver sensor data from mobile patients. We propose a monitoring system with two types of nodes: patient nodes equipped with wireless <b>pulse</b> oximeters and <b>relays</b> nodes used to route data to a base station. A reliability analysis of data collection from mobile users shows that mobility leads to packet losses exceeding 30 %. The majority of packet losses occur between the mobile subjects and the first-hop relays.

DRAP enables highly reliable data collection from mobile subjects. Empirical evaluation showed that DRAP delivered at least 96 % of data from multiple users.

We investigated {{the cause of}} the aggregation defect in transformants overexpressing dominant-negative PKA regulatory subunits (PKA-RM) under an actin 15 promoter.

Unstimulated and cAMP pulse-induced expression of other aggregative genes encoding the cAMP receptor cAR 1, adhesive contact sites A and cAMP-phosphodiesterase were also strongly reduced in the mutants. Additionally, the expression of the discoidin I gene, that is expressed early in development in response to cell density sensing factors, was almost completely absent. These data are in interesting contrast with observations that cAMP relay and aggregative gene expression are normal in null mutants for the PKA catalytic (C) subunit and suggest the presence of multiple C subunit genes in Dictyostelium and an almost universal requirement for PKA activity in developmental gene expression...|$|R

40|$|SummaryPerhaps {{the most}} {{difficult}} biological question of all might be how and why electrochemical neuronal activity in the brain generates subjective conscious experience such as the redness of red or the painfulness of pain. Neuroscientists track how light impinging on the retina is transformed into electrical <b>pulses</b> (neuronal spikes), <b>relayed</b> through the visual thalamus to reach the visual cortex, and finally culminates in activity within speech-related areas causing us to say ‘red’. But how such experience as the redness of red emerges from the processing of sensory information is utterly mysterious. It is also unclear why these experiences possess phenomenal characteristics, which can be directly accessed only from the subject having the experience. This is called the ‘hard problem’ of consciousness as coined by the philosopher David Chalmers. The phenomenal aspect of consciousness or ‘what it is like’ character of subjective experience is called ‘qualia’; the singular form of the word is ‘quale’, from the Latin for ‘what sort’ or ‘what kind’. In this Primer, we {{provide an overview of}} the term ‘qualia’ and its conceptual issues, and how neurobiological approaches can contribute to clarify some of these issues...|$|R

The Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT) is the designated United States representative to INTELSAT and also performs technical service for INTELSAT in monitoring the design, fabrication, and test of {{communications satellite}}s. The TT&C subsystem consists of two functionally redundant and independent command and telemetry channels, the major elements of which are shown in Figure 1. The telemetry subsystem provides two data channels for formatting and transmitting data received from sensors, transducers, and status indicators in the various subsystems of the spacecraft. In addition, the output of a command receiver can be connected to a telemetry transmitter to form a ranging transponder. The telemetry unit can provide normal or dwell PCM data in NRZ-M format modulated on a 32 KHz subcarrier. The telemetry transmitter phase modulates one of the data subcarriers or ranging tones on a 4 GHz band downlink carrier. The transmitter output is routed directly to an earth coverage conical horn for transmission {{at a level of}} approximately 0. 0 dbW. The transmitter output can also be routed through a zone communications channel TWTA to a telemetry omni-directional bicone antenna for extended coverage. Commands and ranging tones are received on a 6 GHz band uplink carrier through dual Omni pattern antennas. The received signal is routed through a passive filter to the two command receivers where the frequency modulated command or ranging tones are detected. The command tones are routed to the command units for processing. The command transmission is either a command message, consisting of 58 serial bit, or a command execute.

40|$|An {{interesting}} but largely unanswered biological {{question is}} how eukaryotic organisms regulate the size of multicellular tissues. During development, a lawn of Dictyostelium cells breaks up into territories, and within the territories the cells aggregate in dendritic streams to form groups of ∼ 20, 000 cells. Using random insertional mutagenesis to search for genes involved in group size regulation, we found that an insertion in the cnrN gene affects group size. Cells lacking CnrN (cnrN−) form abnormally small groups, which can be rescued by the expression of exogenous CnrN. <b>Relayed</b> <b>pulses</b> of extracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) direct cells to aggregate by chemotaxis to form aggregation territories and streams. cnrN− cells overaccumulate cAMP during development and form small territories. Decreasing the cAMP pulse size by treating cnrN− cells with cAMP phosphodiesterase or starving cnrN− cells at a low density rescues the small-territory phenotype. The predicted CnrN sequence has similarity to phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which in Dictyostelium inhibits cAMP-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase signaling pathways. CnrN inhibits cAMP-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 -trisphosphate accumulation, Akt activation, actin polymerization, and cAMP production. Our results suggest that CnrN is a protein with some similarities to PTEN and that it regulates cAMP signal transduction to regulate territory size...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{oscillation}} of chemoattractant cyclic AMP (cAMP) in Dictyostelium discoideum is {{a collective}} phenomenon {{that occurs when}} the basal level of extracellular cAMP exceeds a threshold and invokes cooperative mutual excitation of cAMP synthesis and secretion. For <b>pulses</b> to be <b>relayed</b> from cell to cell repetitively, secreted cAMP must be cleared and brought down to the subthreshold level. One of the main determinants of the oscillatory behavior is thus how much extracellular cAMP is degraded by extracellular phosphodiesterase (PDE). To date, {{the exact nature of}} PDE gene regulation remains elusive. Here, we performed live imaging analysis of mRNA transcripts for pdsA—the gene encoding extracellular PDE. Our analysis revealed that pdsA is upregulated during the rising phase of cAMP oscillations. Furthermore, by analyzing isolated cells, we show that expression of pdsA is strictly dependent on the presence of extracellular cAMP. pdsA is induced only at ∼ 1  nM extracellular cAMP, which is almost identical to the threshold concentration for the cAMP relay response. The observed precise regulation of PDE expression together with degradation of extracellular cAMP by PDE form a dual positive and negative feedback circuit, and model analysis shows that this sets the cAMP level near the threshold concentration for the cAMP relay response {{for a wide range of}} adenylyl cyclase activity. The overlap of the thresholds could allow oscillations of chemoattractant cAMP to self-organize at various starving conditions, making its development robust to fluctuations in its environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} a two-way relay network {{in which two}} users exchange messages through a single relay using a physical-layer network coding (PNC) based protocol. The protocol comprises two phases of communication. In the multiple access (MA) phase, two users transmit their modulated signals concurrently to the relay, and in the broadcast (BC) phase, the relay broadcasts a network-coded (denoised) signal to both users. Nonbinary and binary network codes are considered for uniform and nonuniform pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) adopted in the MA phase, respectively. We {{examine the effect of}} different choices of symbol mapping (i. e., mapping from the denoised signal to the modulation symbols at the relay) and bit mapping (i. e., mapping from the modulation symbols to the source bits at the user) on the system error-rate performance. A general optimization framework is proposed to determine the optimal symbol/bit mappings with joint consideration of noisy transmissions in both communication phases. Complexity-reduction techniques are developed for solving the optimization problems. It is shown that the optimal symbol/bit mappings depend on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the channel and the modulation scheme. A general strategy for choosing good symbol/bit mappings is also presented based on a high-SNR analysis, which suggests using a symbol mapping that aligns the error patterns in both communication phases and Gray and binary bit mappings for uniform and nonuniform PAM, respectively.

40|$|Abstract: We {{studied the}} {{response}} of males to the singing of nearby male conspecifics in two species of the orthopteran genus Cyphoderris, primitive relatives of crickets and katydids. Lone male Cyphoderris buckelli stridulating in a large cage made a phonotactic approach to a nearby speaker broadcasting conspecific calling song. But in field experiments no phonotaxis to song broadcasts occurred; rather, {{a significant number of}} male C. buckelli increased their chirp duty cycle and pulse rate. There was no change in their carrier frequency. Calling male Cyphoderris monstrosa were exposed in the field to (i) playback of a synthetic calling song at a typical conspecific <b>pulse</b> rate, (ii) <b>relayed</b> broadcast of their own call, and (iii) low-frequency audio noise. Call duty cycle decreased significantly in response to the noise, while the pooled song models fell just short of significance. Singing C. buckelli were marked individually and their perches flagged over successive nights. We observed low site fidelity and extensive male displacement. Such behaviour is inconsistent with defense of topographically fixed singing territories and concurs with the absence of fighting in this species. Chirp duty cycle was increased significantly in C. buckelli in response to the singing of nearby conspecifics, but unlike in C. monstrosa, this change in duty cycle plays no role in overt aggression, though it may maintain a male’s relative attractiveness to females.

The activations of Ca 2 + influx, adenylyl cyclase, and guanylyl cyclase in response to a pulse of cAMP are strongly inhibited in cells lacking CMF, but are rescued by as little as 10 s exposure of cells to CMF. The activation of phospholipase C by cAMP is not affected by CMF. Northern blots indicate normal levels of the cAMP receptor mRNA in CMF antisense cells during development, while cAMP binding assays and Scatchard plots indicate that CMF antisense cells contain normal levels of the cAMP receptor. In Dictyostelium, both adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases are activated via G proteins. We find that the interaction of the cAMP receptor with G proteins in vitro is not measurably affected by CMF, whereas the activation of adenylyl cyclase by G proteins requires cells to have been exposed to CMF. CMF thus appears to regulate aggregation by regulating an early step of cAMP signal transduction. ...|$|R
