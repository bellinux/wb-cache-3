40|$|Indoor {{residual}} spraying (IRS) {{has been}} proposed by the National Malaria Control Programme of Benin in the districts of Adjohoun, Dangbo, Misserete and Seme. Up to date entomological data are unavailable in these districts. To be effective, this measure {{must be based on}} the knowledge of biology of the malaria vectors. To achieve this aim, vector collections were made in the study area. A total of 49. 059 Culicidae were captured. Anopheles gambiae s. s accounted for 20. 91 % while Anopheles funestus accounted for only 0. 007 %. An. gambiae s. s were molecular form M, resistant to DDT and permethrin, but susceptible to deltamethrin (mortality 100 %) and bendiocarb (mortality 100 %). Endophilic, blood feeding and endophagic rates were respectively estimated to be 65. 74 %, 53. 23 and 70. 18 %. There was no seasonal variation of longevity, but the entomological inoculation rate ranged from 0 to 0. 73 infective bites / person / night according to localities and seasons. This study confirms a high spatial heterogeneity in mosquito distribution and shows that An. gambiae s. s is highly endophagic and endophilic (feed and rest indoor) in south east Benin. While the vector remains susceptible to deltamethrin, high levels of kdr suggest that the use of <b>pyrethrinoid</b> for IRS may be at risk...|$|E
40|$|Influence of {{previous}} pesticide use on Tetranychus urticae and Phytoseiulus persimilis (Acari: Tetranychidae, Phytoseiidae) from strawberry crops {{in the north}} of Morocco. Description of the subject. Effects of recommended doses of five common pesticides in the strawberries of Loukkos area (Morocco) were tested on the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae and its predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis. Laboratory study assessed the contact toxicity of one avermectin miticide (abamectin), two <b>pyrethrinoid</b> insecticide-acaricides (bifenthrin and lambda-cyalothrin), and two fungicides: firstly, mancozeb, which belongs to the dithiocarbamates family of chemicals and secondly, hexaconazole, of the triazole family. Objectives. The aim {{of the present study was}} to test in laboratory conditions the effect of five pesticides on the two-spotted spider mite, T. urticae and its predatory mite, P. persimilis. The five pesticides tested were those most frequently applied for at least two years on strawberries at the experimental site. Method. Bioassays were performed with populations of mites originating from different plots with various crop protection backgrounds. The first group of plots had been repeatedly treated with the five tested pesticides during a two-year period, the second group had been moderately treated, and the third had been treated once with the tested pesticides. Results. Our results showed that the tested pesticides provided effective control of T. urticae but that they were not compatible with use on the predatory mite P. persimilis, as these particular mites did not usually come into contact with these products. On the other hand, in plots where pesticides had been used for a long time, the susceptibility of P. persimilis populations to these products was significantly reduced. Conclusions. If the tested pesticides are to be considered for integrated pest control programs in plots where they have been used for a long time and where P. persimilis is present, their use should be minimized in plots where they have never or rarely been applied...|$|E
40|$|Biomarker {{measurements}} on organisms known as bioindicators are considered as good tools to assess both environmental quality and functioning. Earthworms, by their ecological functions and sensitivity, are relevant organisms {{to evaluate the}} quality of soils disturbed by human activities. Despite {{a great amount of}} experiments intended to study xenobiotics effects on the physiology of soil organisms under controlled conditions, no clear trend emerged concerning the responses of biomarkers. Owing to the high heterogeneity observed in laboratory protocols (species used as models, types and concentrations of contaminants, time of exposure, analysis methods) can even lead to contradictory results. The aim {{of this study was to}} underline the kinetic responses of biomarkers involved in earthworm physiology (defense against oxidative stress, detoxification mechanisms and energy reserves) within time. Our main hypothesis was that the conditions and particularly the time of exposure strongly influenced the results obtained in these studies. Here we provide the most relevant interval of time exposure for each biomarker. Earthworms of the species Aporrectodea icterica were exposed to pesticides in laboratory conditions, at realistic agronomic dose or agronomic dose x 10, alone or in a mixture. Earthworms were placed in microcosms containing contaminated soil, during periods of 2, 4, 7, 10, 14 and 21 days before biomarkers analysis. The two selected pesticide were an insecticide of the <b>pyrethrinoids</b> family, CYTHRINE MAX ® (Cypermethrin) and a fungicide of the strobilurin family, AMISTAR ® (Azoxystrobin), commonly applied in cereal crops. We will present the results of the kinetic responses for each selected biomarkers (catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, proteins …), time of exposure and pesticide dose within time. We will also identify the most suitable period to their measurement...|$|R
40|$|Taking up the {{environmental}} {{challenges of the}} cotton production and marketing chains in Western and Central Africa. The extension of cotton cultivation in Western and Central Africa involves negative consequences for the environment on thelevel of the climatic changes, the reduction of biological diversity and the acceleration of desertifi cation. In addition to the fallof wooded areas {{and the death of}} various animals related to the use of pesticides, it appears that the current production practicesare at the origin of the degradation of the soil fertility through erosion and accelerated mineralization of the organic matter. Being given the major socio-economic importance of the cotton crop in the farming systems of these areas, it is essential toevolve to systems that are at the same time more sustainable and more productive. The achievement of this objective impliesdrastic changes on several levels in the operation of the cotton agrarian systems. These changes concern mainly the applicationof anti-erosive techniques and the restoration/improvement of the soil organic content. With this intention, the introductionof the tree into the agrarian systems and a true integration of agriculture and animal breeding in order to produce and usemore organic manure appear impossible to circumvent. In the long term, the development cropping system under permanentvegetable cover seems to be the technical solution best adapted to the problems of erosion and fall of the soil organic mattercontent; these systems allow indeed a stabilization and a durable improvement of the yields and should favour the applicationof intensifi ed practices regarding the integration of agriculture and animal breeding. The application of these new techniquesimplies important changes on the level of the natural resources management in order to guarantee a right remuneration of the investments made by the producers in terms of land improvements (installation of hedges, windshield, permanent vegetablecover, etc.) and to avoid the negative impact on the produced biomass of the animal divagation and bush fi res. This supposesactions on the level of the land security of the producers, management of the bush fi res and resolution of the potential confl ictsbetween farmers and transhumant stockbreeders. The profi tability of the cotton systems also depends on an effective controlat the best cost of the pests to face the development of resistances to pesticides (in particular to <b>pyrethrinoids).</b> The solution bythe genetically modifi ed plants is the subject of debates with different attitudes from a country to another. The possible answersto take up {{the environmental}} challenges to which the cotton production and marketing chains are confronted are discussed inthe present communication...|$|R
