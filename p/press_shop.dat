50|$|Notching is a {{low-cost}} process, particularly for its low tooling costs {{with a small}} range of standard punches.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A decisive {{criterion}} for {{the selection of}} the optimal press line within the <b>press</b> <b>shop's</b> layout plan is the required press force. The press force necessary to form the component is defined significantly by the stroke range and the corresponding bottom dead centre. The latter finalises the embossing process commonly used for reinforced structures on body components. The high forces required hereby strongly impact the deformation behaviour of the tool and the press and result in force requirements specific to individual presses. This paper examines the significant influences on the maximum force requirements. Examinations of the force requirements using parameter studies on bending, bulge test as well as embossing tests will be presented. The impact of the presses and tools rigidity was determined by way of extensive measurements performed on a mechanical and on a hydraulic press. The decisive criterion here is the bottom dead centre, which can be reproducibly determined using a simple and reliable measurement technique...|$|R
40|$|This note {{is based}} on an {{interview}} with Mr. Kaneyoshi Kusunoki, who worked closely with Mr. Taiichi Ohno, the creator of so-called Toyota Production System. An interview with him was conducted on April 17, 1996 by the authors. First, there was a brief interview on Mr. Kusunoki's involvement in the evolution of Toyota Production System. The interview then focused on how body buffer management between Toyota's assembly, point, body and <b>press</b> <b>shops</b> changed over time. For example, it was revealed that the main functions of painted body storage (PBS) between assembly and paint shops changed as the company automated upstream processes (e. g., welding) in the 1960 s and then expanded exports in the 1970 s. It is obvious from this interview that Toyota did have certain minimum levels of buffers between its production processes, and that the function of the buffers changed as the situations and the firm's capabilities changed historically. ...|$|R
