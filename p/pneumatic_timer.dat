5000|$|The <b>pneumatic</b> <b>timer</b> {{consists}} of a timing disk, filter, diaphragm, solenoid coil, operating spring and a solenoid core. When the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>timer</b> is energized, the solenoid core moves up into the coil. When this occurs, the core applies pressure on the diaphragm. This moves the diaphragm into the top chamber, air trapped in the chamber is expelled through the needle valve timing disk. In pneumatic timers the amount of delay that occurs can be altered by adjusting the needle valve. Pneumatic timers are very reliable and have a very long operational life expectancy ...|$|E
50|$|An {{electronic}} timer allow simple push-buttons to be used. One timer is installed controlling {{the lights and}} any number of push-buttons, without <b>pneumatic</b> <b>timers</b> and connected in parallel, are used to trigger it. With many push-buttons, the cost savings for equipment may be substantial.|$|R

50|$|Hydraulic dashpots or hydraulic-action timers {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} and operation to <b>pneumatic</b> <b>timers.</b> Hydraulic-action timers work by energizing the solenoid coil which pulls the hollow core {{into the center of}} the coil. Fluid in the hollow core is then forced to go through an orifice at the top, a one way check valve at the bottom of the hollow core prevents the fluid from escaping through the bottom. After the fluid is expelled, the core completes its upward movement and closes an air gap in the core, which in turn increases its electromagnetic field strength. When the coil becomes de-energized, it releases the core, and fluid is forced back into the hollow area of the core through the check valve, so the fluid is used again next time the coil is energized. Hydraulic action timers are usually designed for a specific time, which is set in the factory during their manufacture. These timers are also very reliable.|$|R
