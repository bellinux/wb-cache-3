5|$|Systemin and AtPEP1 {{are found}} in the cell cytosol. The <b>precursor</b> <b>to</b> tomato systemin is {{transcribed}} as a 200 amino acid polypeptide. It does not contain a putative signal sequence suggesting that it is synthesised on free ribosomes in the cytosol. The <b>precursor</b> <b>to</b> AtPEP1 is a 92 amino acid polypeptide and also lacks a signal sequence. In tomato, mRNA encoding the precursor for systemin is present at very low levels in unwounded leaves but accumulates upon wounding, particularly in the cells surrounding the sieve elements of the phloem in vascular bundles of mid veins. The precursor accumulates exclusively in the phloem parenchyma cells of leaves in tomato after wounding. The <b>precursor</b> <b>to</b> potato systemin is also localised in a similar manner suggesting it is under the same cell-type-specific regulation in both species.|$|E

5|$|The {{allotetraploid}} hybrid species {{derived from}} A.montanum can backcross with A.montanum to form triploid hybrids. The backcross hybrid between A.montanum and A.pinnatifidum is A.×trudellii, {{as suggested by}} Wherry. He also collected specimens of the backcross hybrid between A.montanum and A.bradleyi from a cliff near Blairstown, New Jersey in 1935. The hybrid received no further attention until 1961, when it was described and named in Wherry's honor as Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi). The sterile diploid A.montanum × platyneuron, <b>precursor</b> <b>to</b> A.bradleyi, was collected in 1972 at Crowder's Mountain, Georgia; A.montanum × rhizophyllum, <b>precursor</b> <b>to</b> A.pinnatifidum, has never been found.|$|E
