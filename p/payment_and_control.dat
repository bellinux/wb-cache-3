40|$|We study a risk {{management}} {{problem in the}} scenario of ship procurement. A shipping firm faces a certain financing pressure for the procurement of a new ship. On the other hand, {{the capacity of the}} ship excesses the demand requirement of the firm. The firm wants to reduce the <b>payment</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> the risk by selling a percentage of capacity to another shipping company. We introduce an auction mechanism for the firm to select the partner and determine the sharing percentage. Acting as the auctioneer, the firm announces a certain percentage of capacity to a set of buyers. The payment from the buyer is determined as the highest bid level except the winning price in a second-price auction. The bidding strategy depends on two signals: the demand and financial fiction. For both the risk-neutral and risk-averse utility functions, we find the unique equilibrium for buyers, and the unique percentage of sharing capacity for the auctioneer. Our new policy not only reduces the cost of financial fiction, but also increases the overall utilization of ship capacity. The numerical experiments illustrate that the percentage of the payments from auction is usually higher than the percentage of the capacity shared to the partner. The firm improves the performance significantly through our auction mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Current {{relational}} database systems are ill-equipped {{for changing the}} structure of data while the database is in use. This {{is a real problem}} for systems for which we expect 24 / 7 availability, such as telecommunication, <b>payment,</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> systems. As a result, developers tend to avoid making changes because of the downtime consequences. The urgency to solve this problem is evident by a multitude of tools developed in industry, such as pt-online-schema-change 1 and oak-online-alter- table 2. Also, MySQL recently added limited support for online schema changes 3. Contributions: We want to draw the attention of the database community to the problem of online schema changes. We have defined requirements for online schema change mechanisms, and we have experimentally investigated existing solutions. Our results show that current solutions are unsatisfactory for complex schema changes. We propose lazy schema changes as a solution. Experimental Setup: To assess the performance and behaviour of existing mechanisms for on- line schema changes, we have developed an experiment based on the standard TPC-C benchmark. For each of the relational schema transformation classes that we have identified, we chose a rep- resentative transformation for the TPC-C schema. We perform the schema change online while the TPC-C benchmark is running, and measure the impact on the TPC-C transaction through- put. We have performed our experiment on PostgreSQL, which does not support online schema changes, MySQL, which supports basic online schema changes, and using pt-online-schema-change on MySQL, as a representative for tools that use triggers to allow online schema changes. Results: We found that existing solutions are inadequate except for the simplest of schema changes. Some single-relation transformations can be performed transactionally and online. How- ever, existing solutions do not allow schema transformations to be composed using transactions. As a result, in complex transformations, intermediate states can be exposed to database programs, which are non-trivial to handle correctly. A secondary problem is that these solutions are much slower than offline transformations, which may not be acceptable for certain applications. Proposal: We propose a more fundamental solution based on lazy schema transformations. The main idea is that schema changes can be described as a view on the existing schema, which can be materialized lazily to perform the schema transformation. The data in the new schema is immedi- ately accessible by computing parts of the view on demand. For a large number of cases we expect that this approach allows schema transformations without any downtime, and with minimal impact on running transactions, while the ACID properties are maintained. Moreover, lazy transforma- tions can naturally be composed as transactions, allowing complex online schema transformations. We are developing an implementation of these ideas based on a persistent functional language...|$|E

40|$|Considered {{by many to}} be science fiction, {{information}} and communication technology (ICT) has been implanted into the human body for years. Medical human ICT implants such as cochlear implants are in common use, forming intimate links between technology and body. Such restorative devices are increasingly advanced, with some directly interacting with the brain and others near outperforming their natural counterpart. Recently, low-tech human ICT implants have been increasingly employed in non-therapeutic contexts. Applications include VIP nightclub entry, automated <b>payments</b> <b>and</b> <b>controlling</b> secure access. With self-experimenters pushing boundaries and medical technology drift to non-medical application, this is clearly just the beginning. Opportunities for human enhancement through ICT implants have become very real. Despite stakeholders calling for greater legal certainty, gaps have already emerged between the commercial reality of human ICT implants and the legal frameworks used to regulate them. It is not surprising that increasing commercialisation and growing potential has generated debate over the ethical, legal and social aspects of the technology, its products and application. And its trajectory. The contributors to this book, all leaders in their respective fields, not only focus on the latest technological developments, but also the legal, social and ethical implications of the use and further application of these technologies. nrpages: XXII, 184 pstatus: publishe...|$|R

Accordingly, we introduce the cameral accounting as an alternative framework, which allows using the money (cash) accounts to report the money effects of revenues and expenditures.

We argue that the Bank of France always favoured informal methods to manage the Paris money market, but that bimetallism did not generally facilitate such techniques.
