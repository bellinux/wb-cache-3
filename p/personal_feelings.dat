In 1986, he signed with the American Musical Academy of Arts Association (AMAAA), and released another album, <b>Personal</b> <b>Feelings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Love in Several Masques is a play by Henry Fielding {{that was}} first {{performed}} on 16 February 1728 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. The moderately received play comically depicts three lovers trying {{to pursue their}} individual beloveds. The beloveds require their lovers to meet their various demands, {{which serves as a}} means for Fielding to introduce his <b>personal</b> <b>feelings</b> on morality and virtue. In addition, Fielding introduces criticism of women and society in general.|$|E
5|$|The couple first {{wrote about}} the {{experience}} in articles for the online magazine The Tyee. The popularity of the articles led to a book deal. In the book, Smith and MacKinnon each write alternate chapters, 12 in total. The first chapter is written by MacKinnon and focuses on {{the first month of}} their experience. They write in the first person as a memoir that explores their own dietary experiences and <b>personal</b> <b>feelings.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{last point}} about the pre-{{engagement}} and engagement was whether participants provided any case of <b>personal</b> <b>feeling.</b> At {{the beginning of the}} task, participants didn’t provide their own <b>personal</b> <b>feeling,</b> neither about the content of the tasks nor about the syntactic, intonation and discourse devices. But, {{towards the end of the}} task they showed their <b>personal</b> <b>feeling</b> by saying if they liked a special grammatical structure or if they always had problems in using a special kind of syntactic device or whether they wanted to provide special kind of organization at discourse level such as showing cause and effect or putting an order to the ideas in the way they liked.|$|R

5|$|Besides {{the many}} {{literary}} sources, Eliot also draws on his <b>personal</b> <b>feelings</b> and experience, {{especially on the}} great stress that he felt while composing the poem. Similarly, Eliot used the image of pilgrims coming to America and the stories of them that were common throughout his childhood. In particular, his mother wrote poems about the pilgrims arriving in New England, and Eliot found information related to his family's history in a book called Sketch of the Eliot Family. The location, East Coker, was where Andrew Eliott, T. S. Eliot's ancestor, left when joining the pilgrimage.|$|E
5|$|Life Is Good is the {{eleventh}} studio album by American rapper Nas. It was recorded at various studios in New York and California, and produced primarily by No I.D. and Salaam Remi. Nas wrote the album after his divorce from recording artist Kelis and {{compared it to}} Marvin Gaye's 1978 record Here, My Dear. He wanted to vent <b>personal</b> <b>feelings</b> and address moments in his life in his songs, while drawing on 1980s hip hop influences for the album's production in order to complement its nostalgic tone.|$|E
5|$|Musically, {{the album}} is {{structured}} like a DJ's set. The songs are sequenced and blended together {{so that they are}} played continuously without any gaps. The title arrived {{from the fact that the}} album track listing consists of light-hearted and happy songs in the beginning, and progresses to much darker melodies and lyrics describing <b>personal</b> <b>feelings</b> and commitments. Songs on the album sample and reference the music of other dance-oriented artists like ABBA, Donna Summer, Pet Shop Boys, the Bee Gees and Depeche Mode, as well as Madonna's 1980s output.|$|E

Perhaps it seems like <b>personal</b> <b>feeling</b> in me to say so--and there's a good deal of that, I own--but <b>personal</b> <b>feeling</b> is not always in the wrong if you boil it down to the impressions which make it simply an opinion." ...|$|R

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} influences on History of a Six Weeks' Tour was Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (1796), written by Mary Shelley's mother Mary Wollstonecraft. A travel narrative that reflects on topography, politics, society, aesthetics, and the author's <b>personal</b> <b>feelings,</b> it provided a model for Mary Shelley's work. Like her mother, Mary Shelley revealed her liberalism by boldly discussing politics; however, this political tone was unusual for travel works at the time and was considered inappropriate for women writers. Like Wollstonecraft's Letters, History of a Six Weeks' Tour blurs the line between private and public spheres by using intimate genres such as the journal and the letter, allowing Mary Shelley to present political opinions through personal anecdote and the picturesque.|$|E
5|$|The Baltimore Sun runs {{a front-page}} story accusing the {{homicide}} unit of fumbling the investigation and protecting the Wilsons based on their race. Under pressure form his superiors, Gee demands they solve the murder immediately. Pembleton admits privately to his wife Mary (Ami Brabson) that he let his <b>personal</b> <b>feelings</b> of respect for Felix Wilson {{get in the way}} of the investigation; he agrees to make them a central part of the investigation. After searching the Wilson house, the detectives find love letters written by Hal Wilson to Brierre. Pembleton questions Felix and Hal, who agree to talk only if their statements are not admissible in court. Pembleton confronts the Wilsons with the love letters, which Hal said he never had the courage to give to Brierre. Felix said he would not have had sex with Brierre if he had known, which Hal said he does not believe. Felix demands the truth from Hal, who admits to killing Brierre in a jealous rage upon learning of her affair with his father.|$|E
5|$|Within the year, Edward {{caused a}} {{constitutional}} crisis by announcing {{his desire to}} marry his twice-divorced American mistress, Wallis Simpson. Mary disapproved of divorce, which was against {{the teaching of the}} Anglican church, and thought Simpson wholly unsuitable to be the wife of a king. After receiving advice from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Stanley Baldwin, as well as the Dominion governments, that he could not remain king and marry Simpson, Edward abdicated. Though loyal and supportive of her son, Mary could not comprehend why Edward would neglect his royal duties in favour of his <b>personal</b> <b>feelings.</b> Simpson had been presented formally to both King George V and Queen Mary at court, but Mary later refused to meet her either in public or privately. She saw it as her duty to provide moral support for her second son, the reserved and stammering Prince Albert, Duke of York, who ascended the throne on Edward's abdication, taking the name George VI. When Mary attended the coronation, she became the first British dowager queen to do so. Edward's abdication did not lessen her love for him, but she never wavered in her disapproval of his actions.|$|E

25|$|Dejection: An Ode is a poem {{written by}} Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1802. The poem in its {{original}} form was written to Sara Hutchinson, {{a woman who was}} not his wife, and discusses his feelings of love for her. The various versions of the poem describe Coleridge's inability to write poetry and living in a state of paralysis, but published editions remove his <b>personal</b> <b>feelings</b> and mention of Hutchinson.|$|E
25|$|Suggested by Leon Festinger, {{cognitive}} dissonance occurs {{when an individual}} experiences some degree of discomfort resulting from an inconsistency between two cognitions: {{their views on the}} world around them, and their own <b>personal</b> <b>feelings</b> and actions. For example, a consumer may seek to reassure themselves regarding a purchase, feeling that another decision may have been preferable. Their feeling that another purchase would have been preferable is inconsistent with their action of purchasing the item. The difference between their feelings and beliefs causes dissonance, so they seek to reassure themselves.|$|E
25|$|Cromwell {{controversy}} {{continued into}} the 20th century. As First Lord of the Admiralty before the First World War, Winston Churchill twice suggested naming a British battleship HMS Oliver Cromwell. The suggestion was vetoed by King George V, {{not only because of}} his <b>personal</b> <b>feelings</b> but because he felt, given the anger caused by the erection of the statue outside Parliament, to give such a name to an expensive warship at a time of Irish political unrest was unwise. Churchill was eventually told by the First Sea Lord Admiral Battenberg that the king's decision must be treated as final.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1927 {{the family moved to}} Vodice, near Šibenik, and from 1928 they lived in Supetar on the island of Brač. There, Job {{embarked}} on the most creative time of his artistic career, and his style began to resemble that of Van Gogh. Job's focus was on recording the impulse of his <b>personal</b> <b>feelings,</b> and strong expressiveness became a feature of his work. The following year, 1929, he held his first solo exhibition in Split, which was well received by public and critics alike. By his next solo exhibition at the Salon Galić in Split, Job's style had developed more toward expressionism.|$|E
25|$|By 1457, however, she had {{withdrawn}} from the court and distanced herself from her husband, partly to side with her son in his estrangement with him, partly out {{of a desire to}} live a more devout and quieter life. Her <b>personal</b> <b>feelings</b> came into conflict with the decisions of her husband, resulting in her abandoning court and taking up refuge in the castle of La Motte-au Boi, where she established a parallel court, which became a protectorate for the victims of her husband's official politics. At that time she assisted the Flemish harmed by Philip's military actions and, under her protection, advanced Josse van Huerter to her nephew, the Infante Fernando of Portugal.|$|E
25|$|During {{the second}} quarter-final match between India and Bangladesh, Rubel Hossain bowled a full toss to Rohit Sharma who was caught at square-leg. The umpire thought {{the ball was}} too high and {{declared}} it a no ball, meaning the batsman was not out. Replays showed that the ball was waist height, and therefore a legal delivery. The ICC's Bangladeshi President, Mustafa Kamal, later questioned {{the integrity of the}} umpire and threatened to resign in protest and Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said India won the match because of umpiring errors. However, ICC chief executive Dave Richardson claimed the accusations were baseless, and based on <b>personal</b> <b>feelings</b> of an individual. He said the incident was a 50–50 call and the decision belonged to the umpire.|$|E
50|$|The Ravad's {{criticism}} of the Rambam's code of Jewish law, the Mishneh Torah, is very harsh. This was not due to <b>personal</b> <b>feeling,</b> but to radical differences of view in matters of faith between the two greatest Talmudists of the twelfth century.|$|R
