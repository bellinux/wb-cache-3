5|$|<b>Psychedelic</b> rock is {{a diverse}} style of rock music inspired, influenced, or {{representative}} of <b>psychedelic</b> culture, which is centred around perception-changing hallucinogenic drugs. <b>Psychedelic</b> rock {{is intended to}} replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of <b>psychedelic</b> drugs, most notably LSD. Many <b>psychedelic</b> groups differ in style, and the label is often used indiscriminately.|$|E
5|$|<b>Psychedelic</b> rock, {{with its}} {{distorted}} guitar sound, extended solos and adventurous compositions, {{has been seen}} as an important bridge between blues-oriented rock and later heavy metal. American bands whose loud, repetitive <b>psychedelic</b> rock emerged as early heavy metal included the Amboy Dukes and Steppenwolf. From England, two former guitarists with the Yardbirds, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page, moved on to form key acts in the genre, The Jeff Beck Group and Led Zeppelin respectively. Other major pioneers of the genre had begun as blues-based <b>psychedelic</b> bands, including Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Judas Priest and UFO. <b>Psychedelic</b> music also contributed to the origins of glam rock, with Marc Bolan changing his <b>psychedelic</b> folk duo into rock band T. Rex and becoming the first glam rock star from 1970. From 1971 David Bowie moved on from his early <b>psychedelic</b> work to develop his Ziggy Stardust persona, incorporating elements of professional make up, mime and performance into his act.|$|E
5|$|While <b>psychedelic</b> rock {{began to}} waver {{at the end}} of the 1960s, <b>psychedelic</b> soul {{continued}} into the 1970s, peaking in popularity in the early years of the decade, and only disappearing in the late 1970s as tastes began to change. Acts like Earth, Wind and Fire, Kool and the Gang and Ohio Players, who began as <b>psychedelic</b> soul artists, incorporated its sounds into funk music and eventually the disco which partly replaced it.|$|E
50|$|Examples of {{classical}} <b>psychedelics</b> include DMT, LSD and psilocybin. The tryptamine <b>psychedelics,</b> such as DMT and psilocybin, structurally resemble serotonin itself. The phenethylamine <b>psychedelics</b> {{on the other}} hand, such as mescaline, and compounds of the 2C family, more closely resemble the neurotransmitter dopamine.|$|R

50|$|According to Johansen, {{the ban on}} <b>psychedelics</b> {{goes against}} human rights because the {{substances}} are less harmful than other common activities and because <b>psychedelics</b> {{play an important role}} in belief, spiritual practice, personality development and leisure.|$|R
5|$|After {{about two}} months of rehearsals, Shades of Deep Purple was {{recorded}} in only three days in May 1968 and contains four original songs and four covers, thoroughly rearranged to include classical interludes and sound more <b>psychedelic.</b> Stylistically the music is close to <b>psychedelic</b> rock and progressive rock, two genres with an ever-growing audience in the late 1960s.|$|E

[...] She reports that her first experience with <b>psychedelics</b> was cannabis as a performing arts student in the 1980s.

5|$|Song of Innocence is an {{instrumental}} jazz fusion record that incorporates elements of classical, rock, funk, pop, and theatre music. It {{is arranged for}} bass, drums, and string instruments, written in the rock idiom with tempos centered on rock-based patterns by Palmer. Axelrod used contrast in his orchestral compositions and interspersed the album's euphoric <b>psychedelic</b> R form with dramatic, harrowing arrangements to reflect the supernatural themes found in Blake's poems. The music's reverent, <b>psychedelic</b> overtones evoke their themes of innocence and spirituality.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the lead}} of Hendrix in rock, psychedelia began to {{influence}} African American musicians, particularly {{the stars of the}} Motown label. This <b>psychedelic</b> soul was influenced by the civil rights movement, giving it a darker and more political edge than much <b>psychedelic</b> rock. Building on the funk sound of James Brown, it was pioneered from about 1968 by Sly and the Family Stone and The Temptations. Acts that followed them into this territory included Edwin Starr and the Undisputed Truth. George Clinton's interdependent Funkadelic and Parliament ensembles and their various spin-offs took the genre to its most extreme lengths making funk almost a religion in the 1970s, producing over forty singles, including three in the US top ten, and three platinum albums.|$|E
5|$|Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of {{rock music}} {{that began in}} the mid-1960s, with the garage, <b>psychedelic</b> and blues rock movements.

5|$|In the 1990s the Elephant 6 collective, {{including}} {{acts like}} The Apples in Stereo, The Olivia Tremor Control, Neutral Milk Hotel, Elf Power and of Montreal, produced eclectic <b>psychedelic</b> rock and folk. Other alternative acts to pursue psychedelia from the 1990s included The Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Dandy Warhols, Kula Shaker and Super Furry Animals. Stoner rock also emerged, combining elements of <b>psychedelic</b> rock, blues-rock and doom metal. Typically using a slow-to-mid tempo and featuring low-tuned guitars in a bass-heavy sound, with melodic vocals, and 'retro' production, it was pioneered by the Californian bands Kyuss and Sleep. In the UK the Madchester scene influenced the early sound of 1990s Britpop bands like Blur. The Verve mixed on 1960s psychedelia with the shoegazing aesthetic. Oasis also drew on 1960s <b>psychedelic</b> pop and rock. In the immediate post-Britpop era Kula Shaker incorporated swirling, guitar-heavy sounds of late-'60s psychedelia with Indian mysticism and spirituality. In {{the new millennium}} neo-psychedelia was continued by bands directly emulating {{the sounds of the}} 60s such as The Black Angels, Tame Impala, Pond, King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard, Unknown Mortal Orchestra and The Essex Green, while bands like Animal Collective and The Bright Light Social Hour applied an experimental approach that combined genres from the 1960s and the present.M.
