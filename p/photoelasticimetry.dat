40|$|We {{present a}} novel Couette shear {{apparatus}} capable of generating programmable azimuthal strain inside 2 D granular matter under Couette shear. The apparatus consists of 21 independently movable concentric rings and two boundary wheels with frictional racks. This {{makes it possible}} to quasistatically shear the granular matter not only from the boundaries but also from the bottom. We show that, by specifying the collective motion of wheels and rings, the apparatus successfully generates the desired strain profile inside the sample granular system, which is composed of about 2000 photoelastic disks. The motion and stress of each particle is captured by an imaging system utilizing reflective <b>photoelasticimetry.</b> This apparatus provides a novel method to investigate shear jamming properties of granular matter with different interior strain profiles and unlimited strain amplitudes...|$|E
40|$|The {{propagation}} of laser-induced shock waves in a transparent epoxy sample is investigated by optical shadowgraphy. The shock waves are {{generated by a}} focused laser (3 ns pulse duration— 1. 2 to 3. 4 TWcm− 2) producing pressure from 44 to 98. 9 GPa. It is observed that the shock wave and the release wave created by the shock reverberation at the rear face are both followed by a dark zone in the pictures. This corresponds {{to the creation of}} a tensile zone resulting from the crossing on the loading axis of the release waves coming from the edge of the impact area (2 D effects). After the laser shock experiment, the residual stresses in the targets are identified and quantified through a <b>photoelasticimetry</b> analysis of the recovered samples. This work results in a new set of original data which can be directly used to validate numerical models implemented to reproduce the behaviour of epoxy under extreme strain rate loading. The residual stresses observed prove that the high-pressure shocks can modify the pure epoxy properties, which could have an influence on the use made of these materials...|$|E
