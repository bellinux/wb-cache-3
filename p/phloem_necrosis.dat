40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to develop a}} better understanding of the relationship between symptom development and the nature of the citrus disease, huanglongbing. The most characteristic symptom of huanglongbing (HLB) is the non-symmetrical mottled chlorosis of leaf blades. Starch accumulation and phloem collapse have been associated with symptom development in this disease presumed to be caused by Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus. Several hypotheses regarding phloem disruption to starch accumulation to chlorosis evolved concerning symptom development. These were tested using light and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Samples collected and fixed for TEM with various stages of HLB symptoms, revealed the following: starch accumulation occurred after phloem plugging and cell collapse and therefore, localized carbohydrate deficiency may be a factor. Starch packing of chloroplasts did not rupture the outer membranes, but the inner grana structure was disrupted thus, leading to chlorosis. This occurred only in parts of the leaf where phloem plugging occurred. Sieve elements were obstructed by both amorphous and filamentous materials and both occurred in readily observed amounts, while bacteria were insufficient to directly cause plugging. The amorphous material was positively identified as callose by immunoassay with gold labeling. Phloem protein 2 was identified in the filamentous plugging material using immunoassay with gold labeling. This information supports the development of HLB symptoms in the following sequence: <b>phloem</b> plugging and <b>necrosis</b> with cell wall swelling of sieve elements and companion cells followed by some phloem cell collapse, presumed sugar backup in localized leaf blade areas leading to starch accumulation until chloroplast structure is disrupted with resulting chlorosis...|$|R

40|$|Elm yellows (EY) and alder yellows (ALY) are decline {{diseases}} {{associated with}} the presence of phytoplasmas that affects several Ulmus (elm) and Alnus (alder) species, respectively. EY is widespread in North America and Europe whereas ALY is restricted to Europe. These diseases are mainly {{associated with the}} presence of closely related phytoplasmas, the EY agent ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma ulmi’ and the ALY agent, which are members of the EY or 16 SrV group, subgroups 16 SrV-A and -C, respectively. EY symptoms vary among the elm species. Foliar yellowing, extensive <b>phloem</b> <b>necrosis</b> and death are predominant in North American species.

40|$|Vigor {{state of}} middle-aged pine stands was {{estimated}} during 2002 - 2008 at {{permanent sample plots}} by two methods: 1) visual estimation of stand vigor rank according to the 6 -point scale of Forest Regulations of RF and 2) method of induction of tree defense response (injection of stem with high molecular extractives from Ceratocystis laricicola mycelium and registration of parameters of stem <b>phloem</b> <b>necrosis).</b> The stands of similar origin and structure were preliminarily divided into background and polluted ones {{on the basis of}} different amount of polluting substances in snow cover. Estimation of external tree signs according to 6 -point scale didn't reveal significant differences between stands in monitored period. In contrast to this morphological method parameters of specific necrotic response of stem inner bark to fungal extract differed significantly in background and polluted stands. Parameters of the necrotic spots on the phloem were shown to depend on effect of creeping fire. The necrosis size increased and the necrosis "moved" toward crown during two years after the fire.

40|$|Trunk <b>phloem</b> <b>necrosis</b> (TPN) is {{currently}} a main constraint in rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations. The apparent spread of the disease, {{from tree to tree}} along the planting line, strongly supported the implication of a pathogen that could be transmitted mechanically via the tapping knife. In order to detect a causal agent of the disease, studies focusing on characterization of the known mechanically transmitted pathogens (e. g. viroids, cryptic viruses or phytoplasma) were initiated. RNA strands of low molecular weight (200 - 400 and > 500 bp) displaying structural similarities with viroids and viral dsRNAs were observed in various tested samples. However, attempts to show the potential role of these RNA molecules in the spread of the disease failed. First of all, there was no significant or reproducible correlation between the health status of the rubber trees sampled and these RNA molecules. Moreover, no sequence homology with known pathogens could be found when randomly amplified cDNA fragments isolated from trees presenting the disease symptoms were sequenced. In conclusion, the aetiological investigations, in order to show the presence of a pathogen responsible of the TPN disease, were non-conclusive, which tends to disprove the hypothesis of a biotic causal agent...|$|E
40|$|Trunk <b>phloem</b> <b>necrosis</b> (TPN) is {{currently}} {{one of the}} most economically important diseases of the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). Investigations of the aetiology of the disorder have failed to identify any biotic causal agents but a multidisciplinary study has recently suggested that the disease may be caused by a combination of exogenous and endogenous stresses. These stresses can affect plant physiology and may also have an impact on soil biology and soil biochemistry. In this study, macrofauna diversity and soil enzyme activities were compared for the soils under trees affected by TPN and under healthy trees. Principal component analysis revealed associations between TPN and macrofauna diversity and soil enzyme activities. Groups of ants and termites were associated with the soil under healthy and trees affected by TPN respectively. Polysaccharidase (cellulase, xylanase and, particularly, amylase) activities were lower in the soil under trees affected by TPN whereas N-acetylglucosaminidase activity was higher. These findings suggested that termite density and N-acetylglucosaminidase activity are useful indicators of TPN, while lower values of polysaccharidases activities are the consequence of this disease. The impact of TPN on soil ecosystem was discussed...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at IRRDB Annual Meeting, Siem Reap Cambodia, 12 - 16 November 2007 This paper {{presents the results}} of a pilot project aimed at unravelling putative links between the occurrence of Trunk <b>Phloem</b> <b>Necrosis</b> (TPN) and impeded root system development in a small rubber tree (RRIM 600) plantation of NE Thailand. To investigate as many root parameters as possible, our methodology included a wide range of techniques: destructive sampling, root mapping, rhizolocation, architectural characterisation of coarse woody roots, and electrical measurements by capacitance and earth impedance. We found that under the environmental conditions that prevail in NE Thailand, there is no relationship between most of the root parameters we measured and TPN, at least within the first meter of the soil profile. This result contrasts with observations previously made in western Africa. However, we found that at a soil depth of ~ 25 cm where maximum soil bulk density is generally observed, Healthy (H) trees can grow roots of significantly higher Specific Root Length (SRL) than those affected by TPN. The next phase of this work which is part of a multidisciplinary programme on TPN, will therefore focus on root morphological descriptors such as SRL and on the analysis of the deeper parts of rubber tree root systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Apple stem {{grooving}} virus (ASGV, genus Capillovirus) is disseminated worldwide, usually {{causing a}} latent infection in most commercial apple cultivars.

The differing intensity of symptoms they co-induced on several woody indicator species/cultivars are indicative of biological {{differences between the two}} inocula.

Annual assessments of parameters of defense response of stem phloem of the sample trees on the action of extractives from mycelium Ceratocystis laricicola (Redfern & Minter) were carried out. The size of a <b>phloem</b> <b>necrosis</b> and its shift along a stem relative to inoculation hole were measured. The pine stands (polluted and conditionally background) are convenient for determining condition changes at early stages of damage. These stands are affected by different anthropogenic factors, but don't differ in vigor state as visually estimated on a 6 -point scale of Forest Regulation of Russian Federation. PPs have similar forest inventory characteristics, except for PPs on an edge of polluted pine forest where the site class is reduced. Significant shift of necrosis in phloem up on a stem within two years following a year {{when there was a}} spring creeping fire is registered. It proves the reversal of normal basipetal transport of assimilates toward crown and feasibility of using necrosis asymmetry for assessment of fire influence on physiological condition of pine stands. The increase of necroses size (decrease of resistance) after a fire was noted during later period in comparison with reversal of transport of assimilates in the stem.

40|$|Trunk <b>phloem</b> <b>necrosis</b> (TPN) of Hevea brasiliensis is an {{irreversible}} syndrome of the phloem that spreads {{from the}} collar towards the tapping cut. It {{is responsible for}} the cessation of latex production, the main constraint in rubber plantations worldwide. Numerous investigations have been undertaken to understand the mechanisms of this disease. The apparent linear spread of TPN supported the initial hypothesis of a biotic causal agent for TPN. However, previous and recent aetiological analyses remained inconclusive and the pathogen hypothesis is tending to be abandoned. In this paper we present a complementary statistical analysis of spatio-temporal epidemiological data collected in a rubber plantation in Cote d'Ivoire. There, four study plots were surveyed each year from 2000 to 2003, with tree-by-tree disease assessment. In two plots, the tapping knife was systematically disinfected with sodium hypochlorite to stop any virus or viroid transmission. Based on permutation tests, our analysis confirmed the aetiological results: there was no evidence for spread by pathogen transmission. However, the spatial structure of the disease was clear. These results strengthen the current alternative scenario of a multi-factor physiological disease caused by an accumulation of exogenous and endogenous stresses. Spatial heterogeneity of the risk factors probably results in the presence of areas of stress that can explain the spatial patterns observed among the TPN cases. The final contribution of this study was confirmation of the curative effect of sodium hypochlorite in the earliest stages of the disease, thus opening the way for control of this disease...|$|E
40|$|We {{performed}} an inoculation experiment using the blue-stain fungus Endoconidiophora polonica at the Rosalia Roof study site, which {{was set up}} to study drought effects on Norway spruce susceptibility to attacks by the European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus. Tree resistance parameters such as resin flow rate and extent of hypersensitive wound reaction in the phloem were investigated prior to and after fungal infection. Sample trees with different drought treatments (trees fully covered or semi-covered by roofs, control trees) were inoculated with E. polonica in July 2014. In order to check for areas of <b>phloem</b> <b>necrosis,</b> the outer bark around the inoculation holes was scratched off 6 weeks later. We recorded the amount of resin exudation within 12 hours overnight in August and September 2013 and 2014. Although wound reaction zones did not differ in size between tree collectives of the various treatments, fully covered trees tended to exhibit larger necrotic areas compared to control trees. The least water supplied trees showed lowest resin flow rates prior to fungal inoculation, but were the only group to show significantly enhanced resin flow five weeks after the evaluation of defence reactions. Our results agree with earlier findings that wounding and few fungal inoculations can increase tree resistance in the medium term given not too severe water stress. Further investigations will clarify how water stress affects the availability of non-structural carbohydrates for secondary metabolism, when depletion of resources eventually occurs, and at which point trees are most susceptible to bark beetle attack...|$|E
40|$|The Panel on Plant Health {{performed}} a pest categorisation of Elm <b>phloem</b> <b>necrosis</b> mycoplasma, now renamed Candidatus Phytoplasma ulmi (CPu), for the European Union (EU) territory. CPu is a well-defined phytoplasma {{species of the}} genus Candidatus Phytoplasma, for which molecular detection assays are available. CPu is transmitted by grafting and vegetative propagation material {{as well as by}} insect vectors. CPu is reported from North America and is present in at least four EU Member States: the Czech Republic, France, Germany and Italy. CPu distribution in Europe is suspected to be underestimated, with high uncertainty since no systematic surveys are carried out. CPu has a host range restricted to Ulmaceae species, and especially to the genus Ulmus, with some variations in susceptibility to the disease. It is listed in Annex IAI of Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. CPu is not expected to be affected by EU ecoclimatic conditions wherever its hosts are present and has the potential to establish largely within the EU territory. Two insect vectors, Macropsis glandacea and Philaenus spumarius, are widely distributed in Europe. The uncertainty about other potential vector species, in which the phytoplasma has been detected, is considered as high. There is a lack of data to fully assess the potential consequences of the disease, with regards to the susceptibility of European elm species and virulence of European CPu strains. Data are not sufficient to reach a conclusion on pest categorisation of CPu and a full risk assessment can be conducted but is unlikely to bring any additional value unless the key additional data gaps on distribution, insect vectors, elm species susceptibility and potential consequences of the pest are filled...|$|E
40|$|Trunk <b>phloem</b> <b>necrosis</b> (TPN), a {{physiological}} bark disorder of the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), {{is a serious}} problem that affects the yield of natural rubber. The resultant bark dryness occurs in up to half of a plantation's trees in almost every rubber tree plantation region, causing a great annual loss of dry rubber for natural rubber production. Different types of injury and physical damage caused by mechanical activation as well as environmental stresses cause physiological bark disorder in tree. Due to the essential role of miR 166, miR 393 and miR 167 in vascular development and abiotic stress response in diverse plant species, it was interesting to investigate the role of these miRNAs in rubber trees, particularly during development of {{a physiological}} bark disorder. In this study, the expression pattern of miR 166, miR 393 and miR 167; and their target genes, HD-ZIP III; TIR 1 and ARF 8, respectively; was demonstrated in healthy tree and different TPN trees. Their existence and function in vivo was validated using RNA ligase-mediated 5 ' rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Taken together, the results suggest a possible dual role of these three miRNAs in maintaining normal bark regeneration in healthy trees, coping with overtapping by affecting the wound healing system leading to abnormal bark regeneration in overtapped-TPN trees, and act as additional forces that enhance the attenuation of vascular development resulting in bark necrosis and cell death in the natural-TPN tree. This is the first study to address the molecular events of miRNAs involved in the physiological bark disorder TPN in rubber tree. Further study will open the possibility to better understanding of physiological and molecular perspectives during TPN development, and lead to improvement of monitoring the exploitation of rubber tree plantations...|$|E
