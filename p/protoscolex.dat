50|$|T. solium eggs {{can cause}} {{cysticercosis}} in humans. Intermediate hosts, which harbor the disease {{for a short}} period of time, include: sheep, horses, cattle, pigs, and deer. Definitive hosts, which harbor the parasite until it reaches maturity and during sexual reproduction, include dogs, foxes, and other canids. The cysticercus, the larval form, travels and persists in the liver for 18 - 30 days, then burrows out into the peritoneal cavity and attaches to the viscera. When the sheep viscera is scavenged and the scavenger ingests the cysticercus, the <b>protoscolex</b> attaches to the small intestinal wall and the worm begins to form proglottids. Gravid proglottids, containing the eggs, move from the end of the worm and leave the body in the feces. The prepatent period is about 51 days.|$|E
50|$|Pigs ingest {{the eggs}} from human faeces or {{vegetation}} contaminated with human excreta. The embryonated eggs enter the intestine where they hatch into motile oncospheres. The embryonic and basement membranes are removed by the host's digestive enzymes (particularly pepsin). Then the free oncospheres get attached on the intestinal wall using their hooks. With {{the help of}} digestive enzymes from the penetration glands, they penetrate the intestinal mucosa to enter blood and lymphatic vessels. They move along the general circulatory system to various organs, and large numbers are cleared in the liver. The surviving oncospheres preferentially migrate to striated muscles, {{as well as the}} brain, liver, and other tissues, where they settle to form cysts called cysticerci. A single cysticercus is spherical, measuring 1-2 cm in diameter, and contains an invaginated <b>protoscolex.</b> The central space is filled with fluid like a bladder, hence it is also called bladder worm. Cysticerci are usually formed within 70 days and may continue to grow for a year.|$|E
50|$|The {{lifecycle}} {{begins with}} either the gravid proglottids or free eggs (embryophores) with oncospheres (also known as hexacanth embryos) being passed in the feces, which can last for days to months in the environment. Sometimes, these segments will still be motile upon excretion—they either empty themselves of their eggs {{within a matter of}} minutes, or in some species, retain them as a cluster and await the arrival of a suitable intermediate vertebrate host. The intermediate host (cattle, pigs, rodents, etc., depending on the species) must then ingest the eggs or proglottids. If the host is a correct one for the particular species, the embriophores then hatch, and the hexacanth embryos invade the wall of the small intestine of the intermediate host to travel to the striated muscles to develop into cysticerci larvae. Here they grow, cavitate, and differentiate into the second larval form shaped like a bladder (and erroneously believed until the middle of the 19th century to be a separate parasite, the bladderworm) which is infectious to the definitive host when an invaginated <b>protoscolex</b> is completely developed. To continue the process, the definitive host must eat the uncooked meat of the intermediate host. Once in the small intestine of the definitive host, the bladder is digested away, the scolex embeds itself into the intestinal wall, and the neck begins to bud off segments to form the strobila. New eggs usually appear in the feces of the definitive host within 6 to 9 weeks, and the cycle repeats itself.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{viability}} assessment in hydatid cyst {{is important for}} both in vitro and in vivo studies, and also in drug experiments. Several vital and avital stains as neutral red, methylene blue, eosin, Papanicolao, Giemsa, Ziehl-Neelsen, toluidine blue and trypan blue {{have been used to}} assess viability of protoscoleces in fertile cysts. Of them, eosin is the most widely preferred stain. Various concentrations of eosin have been used in the dying procedures. In this study, it was aimed to determine the ideal concentration of eosin for assessing <b>protoscolex</b> fertility. Method: Protoscoleces were treated with eosin concentrations: 0. 05 %, 0. 1 %, 1 %, 3 %, and 5 %. A total of 500 protoscoleces were examined by eosin staining techniques with 0., 5., 15., 30. and 60. -minute intervals. Results: Ideal concentrations of eosin which will be used for viability test to determine the motile flame cells and contractile <b>protoscolex</b> were found as 0. 1 % and 1 %. In viability test of <b>protoscolex,</b> above the 1 % concentration of eosin caused difficulty in the decision of viability because of the darker background.

40|$|Echinococcus granulosus is a {{parasitic}} platyhelminth that {{is responsible}} for cystic hydatid disease. From the inner, germinal layer of hydatid cysts protoscoleces are generated, which are are the infective forms to the dog. Systematic studies on the cell biology of E. granulosus <b>protoscolex</b> formation in natural infections are scarce and incomplete. In the present report we describe seven steps in the development of protoscoleces. Cellular buds formed by a clustering of cells emerge from the germinal layer of hydatid cysts. The buds elongate and the cells at their bases seem to diminish in number. Very early on a furrow appears in the elongated buds, delimiting anterior (scolex) and caudal (body) regions. Hooks are the first fully-differentiated structures formed at the apical region of the nascent scolex. In a more advanced stage, the scolex shows circular projections and depressions that develop into suckers. A cone can later be seen {{at the center of the}} hooks, the body is expanded and a structured neck is evident between the scolex and the body.

40|$|Echinococcus granulosus is the causative {{agent of}} hydatidosis, a major zoonoses that affects humans and herbivorous {{domestic}} animals. The disease {{is caused by}} the pressure exerted on viscera by hydatid cysts that are formed upon ingestion of E. granulosus eggs excreted by canine. Protoscoleces, larval forms infective to canine, develop asynchronously and clonally from the germinal layer (GL) of hydatid cysts. In this report, we describe the cellular organization and the appearance of differentiated structures both in nascent buds and developed protoscoleces attached to the GL. Early <b>protoscolex</b> morphogenesis is a highly complex and dynamic process starting from the constitution of a foramen in the early bud, around which nuclei are distributed mainly at the lateral and apical regions. Similarly, distribution of nuclei in mature protoscoleces is not homogenous but underlies three cellular territories: the suckers, the rostellar pad, and the body, that surrounds the foramen. Several nuclei are associated to calcareous corpuscles (Cc), differentiated structures that are absent in the earlier bud stages. The nurnber of nuclei is similar from the grown, elongated bud stage to the mature <b>protoscolex</b> attached to the GL, strongly suggesting that there is no significant cellular proliferation during final <b>protoscolex</b> development. The amount of DNA per nucleus is in the same range to the one described for most other platyhelminthes. Our results point to a sequential series of events involving cell proliferation, spatial cell organization, and differentiation, starting in early buds at the GL of fertile hydatid cysts leading to mature protoscoleces infective to canine.

40|$|Alveolar {{echinococcosis}} (AE) is {{a severe}} hepatic disorder caused by larval infection by the fox tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis. The course of parasitic development and host reactions {{are known to}} vary significantly among host species, and even among different inbred strains of mice. As reported previously, after oral administration of parasite eggs, DBA/ 2 (D 2) mice showed {{a higher rate of}} cyst establishment and more advanced <b>protoscolex</b> development in the liver than C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) mice. These findings strongly suggest that the outcome of AE is affected by host genetic factor(s). In the present study, the genetic basis of such strain-specific differences in susceptibility/resistance to AE in murine models was studied by whole-genome scanning for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) using a backcross of (B 6 × D 2) F 1 and D 2 mice with varying susceptibility to E. multilocularis infection. For cyst establishment, genome linkage analysis identified one suggestive and one significant QTL on chromosomes (Chrs.) 9 and 6, respectively, whereas for <b>protoscolex</b> development, two suggestive and one highly significant QTLs were detected on Chrs. 6, 17 and 1, respectively. Our QTL analyses using murine AE models revealed that multiple genetic factors regulated host susceptibility/resistance to E. multilocularis infection. Moreover, our findings show that establishment of the parasite cysts in the liver is affected by QTLs that are distinct from those associated with the subsequent <b>protoscolex</b> development of the parasite, indicating that different host factors are involved in the host–parasite interplay at each developmental stage of the larval parasite. Further identification of responsible genes located on the identified QTLs could lead to the development of effective disease prevention and control strategies, including an intensive screening and clinical follow-up of genetically high-risk groups for AE infection...|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} plasma and cyst concentrations of albendazolesulphoxide (ASO) and their effects on parasitological findings and disease recurrence in patients with liver hydatidosis. Methods The study was conducted at the University Hospital for Infectious Diseases “Dr. Fran Mihaljević,” Zagreb, Croatia, between August 2006 and January 2011. Consecutive patients (N = 48, age 6 - 77 years) were treated with albendazole (3 × 5 mg/kg/d) over 28 days before surgical cyst removal (n = 34) or percutaneous evacuation (PAIR) (n = 14). Plasma ASO was determined on days 10 and 28 of treatment and cyst concentrations at surgery/PAIR. Results Disease recurred in 3 surgically treated patients. Variability of ASO concentrations was substantial. Plasma concentrations on day 10 were higher than on day 28 (geometric means ratio [GMR] 2. 00; 95 %CI 1. 38 - 2. 91, P < 0. 001) and higher than cyst concentrations {{at the time of}} treatment (GMR = 1. 58, 1. 01 - 2. 34, P = 0. 045). Higher cyst (but not plasma) concentrations were independently associated with lower odds of <b>protoscolex</b> motility (OR = 0. 23, 0. 01 - 0. 70, P < 0. 001) and higher odds of <b>protoscolex</b> destruction (OR = 1. 17, 1. 04 - 1. 46, P < 0. 001).

40|$|Background The metacestode larva of Echinococcus multilocularis (Cestoda: Taeniidae) {{develops}} {{in the liver}} of intermediate hosts (typically rodents, or accidentally in humans) as a labyrinth of interconnected cysts that infiltrate the host tissue, causing the disease alveolar echinococcosis. Within the cysts, protoscoleces (the infective stage for the definitive canid host) arise by asexual multiplication. These consist of a scolex {{similar to that of}} the adult, invaginated within a small posterior body. Despite the importance of alveolar echinococcosis for human health, relatively little is known about the basic biology, anatomy and development of E. multilocularis larvae, particularly with regard to their nervous system. Results We describe the existence of a subtegumental nerve net in the metacestode cysts, which is immunoreactive for acetylated tubulin-α and contains small populations of nerve cells that are labeled by antibodies raised against several invertebrate neuropeptides. However, no evidence was found for the existence of cholinergic or serotoninergic elements in the cyst wall. Muscle fibers occur without any specific arrangement in the subtegumental layer, and accumulate during the invaginations of the cyst wall that form brood capsules, where protoscoleces develop. The nervous system of the <b>protoscolex</b> {{develops in}}dependently of that of the metacestode cyst, with an antero-posterior developmental gradient. The combination of antibodies against several nervous system markers resulted in a detailed description of the <b>protoscolex</b> nervous system, which is remarkably complex and already {{similar to that of the}} adult worm. Conclusions We provide evidence for the first time of the existence of a nervous system in the metacestode cyst wall, which is remarkable given the lack of motility of this larval stage, and the lack of serotoninergic and cholinergic elements. We propose that it could function as a neuroendocrine system, derived from the nervous system present in the bladder tissue of other taeniids. The detailed description of the development and anatomy of the <b>protoscolex</b> neuromuscular system is a necessary first step toward the understanding of the developmental mechanisms operating in these peculiar larval stages...|$|E
40|$|Through the light- and electron-microscopical {{investigations}} on the histogenesis of larval Echinococcus multilocularis at 5 ～ 60 {{days after}} the inoculation, the following results were obtained. The cyst wall at the initial unilocular stage, 5 ～ 7 {{days after the}} inoculation, is composed of 2 types of cells; the immature syncytial cells, and the light-stained undifferentiated cells with many polysomes. The latter show active mitosis. The wall of the multilocular cysts without a cuticular layer after 7 ～ 14 days comprises light- and dark-stained undifferentiated cells, and the syncytial cells. The dark-stained undifferentiated cells, which contain small mitochondria and polysomes, manifest active mitosis. The initial formation of the cuticular layer begins at the stage later than about 14 days. The cyst wall at this stage is constructed by the cells similar to those at the early stage, but many microvilli and terminal web-like structures are more distinctly demonstrable in the syncytial cytoplasm. At the stage of brood capsule and <b>protoscolex</b> formations, new types of cells are confirmed to appear; the asteroid transforming cells, the muscle cells, the glycogenstoring cells, and the reticular interstitial cells. These cells can be distinguished from one another {{by the appearance of}} myofilaments, glycogen particles and mitochondria, respectively. The perikaryon of the syncytial cell removes {{to the inside of the}} germinal layer and is distant from its distal syncytial cytoplasm. Brood capsule formation originates in the massive accumulation of the dark-stained undifferentiated cells proliferated. A lumen surrounded by the syncytial cells, which line the brood capsule and possess the microvilli, is established at the center of the cellular accumulation. At first, the anlage of <b>protoscolex</b> manifests also the massive accumulation of proliferated dark-stained undifferentiated cells on the brood capsule wall. The anlage protrudes gradually into the lumen of the brood capsule.

40|$|Objectives: Infection {{of humans}} and {{domestic}} ruminants with the larval stage (metacestode) of Echinococcus granulosus results in cystic echinococcosis (CE). The metacestode causes a space-occupying lesion in visceral organs, most commonly in the liver. Benzimidazole carbamate derivatives, such as mebendazole and albendazole, are currently used for chemotherapeutic treatment of CE. In human patients, benzimidazoles have to be applied in high doses for extended periods of time, and adverse side effects are frequently observed. In order to evaluate alternative treatment options, the in vitro efficacy of nitazoxanide, a broad-spectrum drug used against intestinal parasites and bacteria, was investigated. Methods: Freshly isolated E. granulosus protoscoleces were subjected to nitazoxanide treatment (1, 5 and 10 [*]μg/mL), and the effects on parasite viability were monitored by Trypan Blue staining and scanning electron microscopy. <b>Protoscolex</b> cultures were maintained further, until metacestode development took place.

Results: Dose-dependent <b>protoscolex</b> death {{within a few days}} of nitazoxanide treatment was observed. Subsequent in vitro culture of drug-treated protoscoleces confirmed the non-viability of parasites, while further cultivation of non-treated protoscoleces for a period of at least 3 months resulted in stage conversion and the formation of small metacestodes 3 - 4 [*]mm in diameter. Nitazoxanide had a deleterious effect on these metacestodes, which was comparable to that of albendazole.

40|$|AbstractGlycolytic enzymes, such as fructose-bisphosphate {{aldolase}} (FBA) and enolase, {{have been}} described as complex multifunctional proteins that may perform non-glycolytic moonlighting functions, but little is known about such functions, especially in parasites. We have carried out in silico genomic searches in order to identify FBA and enolase coding sequences in Echinococcus granulosus, the causative agent of cystic hydatid disease. Four FBA genes and 3 enolase genes were found, and their sequences and exon–intron structures were characterized and compared to those of their orthologs in Echinococcus multilocularis, the causative agent of alveolar hydatid disease. To gather evidence of possible non-glycolytic functions, the expression profile of FBA and enolase isoforms detected in the E. granulosus pathogenic larval form (hydatid cyst) (EgFBA 1 and EgEno 1) was assessed. Using specific antibodies, EgFBA 1 and EgEno 1 were detected in <b>protoscolex</b> and germinal layer cells, as expected, but they were also found in the hydatid fluid, which contains parasite's excretory–secretory (ES) products. Besides, both proteins were found in <b>protoscolex</b> tegument and in vitro ES products, further suggesting possible non-glycolytic functions in the host–parasite interface. EgFBA 1 modeled 3 D structure predicted a F-actin binding site, and the ability of EgFBA 1 to bind actin was confirmed experimentally, which was taken as an additional evidence of FBA multifunctionality in E. granulosus. Overall, our results represent the first experimental evidences of alternative functions performed by glycolytic enzymes in E. granulosus and provide relevant information for the understanding of their roles in host–parasite interplay...|$|E

EgTPx expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) exhibited significant thiol-dependent peroxidase activity that protected plasmid DNA from damage by metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO) in vitro. Furthermore, the suggested antioxidant role for EgTPx was reinforced in an in vivo assay, whereby its expression in BL 21 bacterial cells markedly increased the tolerance and survival of the cells to high concentrations of H 2 O 2 compared with controls. Immunolocalization studies revealed that EgTPx was specifically expressed in all tissues of the <b>protoscolex</b> and brood capsules. Higher intensity of labelling was detected in many, but not all, calcareous corpuscle cells in protoscoleces. The purified recombinant EgTPx protein was used to screen sera from heavily infected mice and patients with confirmed hydatid infection. Only {{a portion of the}} sera reacted positively with the EgTPx-GST fusion protein in Western blots, suggesting that EgTPx may form antibody-antigen complexes or that responses to the EgTPx antigen may be immunologically regulated. Recombinant EgTPx may prove useful for the screening of specific inhibitors that could serve as new drugs for treatment of hydatid disease. Moreover, given that TPx from different parasitic phyla were phylogenetically distant from host TPx molecules, the development of antiparasite TPx inhibitors that do not react with host TPx might be feasible.

We infected 21 M. arvalis aged 35 days (n= 2), 56 days (n= 6), 84 days (n= 4) and 263 days (n= 9) with 100 E. multilocularis eggs. Four voles aged 263 days were euthanized at 6 weeks post inoculation (wpi) with the remainder euthanized 10 wpi for analysis of metacestode growth and <b>protoscolex</b> development. Eight C 57 BL/ 6 j mice (age 35 - 231 days) were included as controls for egg viability (they have been shown to exhibit visible infection after 4 wpi) and dissected at 6 (n= 2) and 10 (n= 6) wpi. M. arvalis had significantly higher metacestode establishment (p= 0. 008) 6 wpi with 27. 5 ± 6. 63 S. D. compared to C 57 BL/ 6 j with 15. 5 ± 0. 71 S. D. Multivesiculation precluded enumeration at 10 wpi in M. arvalis. No protoscolices were found in metacestodes in M. arvalis 6 wpi or C 57 BL/ 6 j at any time point but were found in all infected voles 10 wpi (48, 056 ± 52, 574 S. D.). It has been reported that glucocorticoid (GC) profile can affect E. multilocularis establishment. This was assessed by measuring corticosterone in rodent hair to determine if parasite establishment or fertility was related to this stress hormone. No significant differences were found.

This approach provides a far superior method for obtaining secondary echinococcosis infections in mice compared with the traditional method of direct inoculation of protoscoleces (PSC) {{where the majority of}} parasites are killed by the host. We obtained a high rate of recovery both in terms of secondary cyst numbers and their viability. After 50 weeks post-infection (p. i.), brood capsules were formed and the first PSC developed in each of the capsules. After 56 weeks p. i., the fastest developing brood capsule contained four PSC.

40|$|Effect of leaf {{extracts}} of Dendrosicyos socotrana and Jatropha unicostata on {{the viability}} of Echinococcus granulosus protoscoleces The present work evaluates the effect of aqueous and methanolic extracts of Dendrosicyos socotrana and Jatropha unicostata on {{the viability of}} Echinococcus granulosus protoscoleces in vitro, and {{on the development of}} secondary hydatid cysts, in vivo. Three different concentrations of each leaf extract were used. Concentrations of 5000 and 1000 μg/mL, for D. socotrana and J. unicostata, respectively, exhibited the highest protoscolicidal activity, significantly reducing and/or stopping <b>protoscolex</b> viability.

The interaction in vitro between ASGP-R and surface oligosaccharide structures of Echinococcus granulosus and Trichinella spiralis was studied by immunohistochemical methods. Specific binding of ASGP-R to ligands on the surface <b>protoscolex</b> of E. granulosus was demonstrated. To the contrary, ASGP-R bound ligand(s) of T. spiralis stihocytes, while a staining reaction was absent from the parasite cuticle.

40|$|Echinococcosis is {{a serious}} {{parasitic}} disease caused by Echinococcus tapeworms. Protoscoleces are sometimes released during surgical treatment for hydatid cysts, causing the recurrence of echinococcosis. Protoscoleces may be susceptible to radiation therapy. In this study Echinococcus protoscoleces were cultured in vitro and then divided into four different γ-ray irradiation dose groups (10 [*]Gy, 20 [*]Gy, 40 [*]Gy, and 80 [*]Gy) and a blank group. The protoscoleces were then implanted into the abdominal cavity of mice. Four months later, we observed that the incidence and weight of cysts declined {{with the increase of}} irradiation dose. γ-ray irradiation can suppress the generation of Echinococcus originated from <b>protoscolex,</b> the reason of which is due to the damaging to the structure of Echinococcus.

Immunofluorescence, in combination with confocal microscopy, revealed that the protein was distributed in small annular foci near the peripheral regions of the protoscoleces. Immunoelectron microscopy of thawed cryosections demonstrated that the laminin-binding protein was present in the cytoplasm of tegumentary cytons and myocytons, but not in cells of the excretory system. The protein was associated with amorphous regions of the cytoplasm, and was not expressed at the surfaces of cells.

40|$|The general fine {{structure}} were studied on fully developed larval Echinococcus multilocularis in cotton rats {{by use of}} electron microscope. The tegument of <b>protoscolex</b> consists essentially of the distal, syncytial cytoplasm (tegumental cytoplasm) of tegumental cell in the parenchyma. The surface of tegument is covered with spinous projections, on the rostellum and suckers, and with knob-like projections, on the posterior part of <b>protoscolex.</b> The tegumental cytoplasm contains vesicles and tubules with or without electron-opaque material. The cytoplasmic continuity is recognized between the tegumental cytoplasm and the perinuclear cytoplasm of tegumental cell. The basement membrane is found beneath the basal plasma membrane of tegumental cytoplasm. The zone of fibrous interstitium underlaying the basement membrane is continuous with the extracellular interspace in the parenchyma. The muscle cells in the parenchyma and sucker of <b>protoscolex,</b> brood capsule and germinal layer comprise the perinuclear cytoplasm with ribosomes and the projections which consist of the amyofibrillar portion with glycogen particles and myofibrillar one with myofibrils. The cells containing numerous alpha particles of glycogen in the perinuclear cytoplasm and the projections, {{are found in the}} above-mentioned places. The sucker established by a mass of muscles and is surrounded with a basement membrane. In the tegumental cytoplasm of rostellum and suckers, the sensory endings are confirmed and show the bulb-like expansion with a cilium-like terminal process. Unmyelinated nerve fibers and those synaptic junctions are recognized among the muscle cells in the parenchyma and the sucker. The nerve fiber contains mitochondria and vesicles, and the synaptic junction has many vesicles accumulating on one side of it. The flame cell in the parenchyma has a bundle of cilia characterized by the general pattern (9 + 2) and the bundle is enveloped with the extension of membraneous cytoplasm. The wall of the excretory duct is made up of the syncytial cytoplasm showing the same character as the tegumental cell. The inner surface of the wall of the brood capsule is covered with the syncytial cytoplasm possessing the villiform projections (microvilli). The perikarya of the syncytial cytoplasm, muscle cells, glycogen-containing cells, and excretory ducts occur along the outer side of the syncytial cytoplasm. The interspace among the above elements is filled with fibrous interstitial material (fibrous interstitium). The cuticular layer of the cyst wall is composed of extracellular, fine, fibrous material which distributes quite equally without lamination. The outer surface of the germinal layer is overlain with the distal, syncytial cytoplasm resembling tegumental cytoplasm. The distal, syncytial cytoplasm of the germinal layer containing a number of mitochondria attaches to the cuticular layer, and is ornamented with a number of well developed microvilli which invade into the cuticular layer. The perikarya of the syncytial cytoplasm, muscle cells, glycogencontaining cells, excretory ducts and fibrous interstitium are recognized along the inner side of the distal, syncytial cytoplasm. Those components are continuous, without a line of distinction, to those of the adjoining brood capsule wall...|$|E
40|$|Background: Alveolar echinococcosis, {{caused by}} Echinococcus multilocularis larvae, is a chronic disease {{associated}} with considerable modulation {{of the host}} immune response. Dendritic cells (DC) are key effectors in shaping the immune response and among the first cells encountered by the parasite during an infection. Although {{it is assumed that}} E. multilocularis, by excretory/secretory (E/S) -products, specifically affects DC to deviate immune responses, little information is available on the molecular nature of respective E/S-products and their mode of action. Methodology/Principal Findings: We established cultivation systems for exposing DC to live material from early (oncosphere), chronic (metacestode) and late (<b>protoscolex)</b> infectious stages. When co-incubated with Echinococcus primary cells, representing the invading oncosphere, or metacestode vesicles, a significant proportion of DC underwent apoptosis and the surviving DC failed to mature. In contrast, DC exposed to protoscoleces upregulated maturation markers and did not undergo apoptosis. After pre-incubation with primary cells and metacestode vesicles, DC showed a strongly impaired ability to be activated by the TLR ligand LPS, which was not observed in DC pre-treated with <b>protoscolex</b> E/S-products. While none of the larvae induced the secretion of pro-inflammatory IL- 12 p 70, the production of immunosuppressive IL- 10 was elevated in response to primary cell E/S-products. Finally, upon incubation with DC and naive T-cells, E/S-products from metacestode vesicles led to a significant expansion of Foxp 3 + T cells in vitro. Conclusions: This is the first report on the induction of apoptosis in DC by cestode E/S-products. Our data indicate that the early infective stage of E. multilocularis is a strong inducer of tolerance in DC, which is most probably important for generating an immunosuppressive environment at an infection phase in which the parasite is highly vulnerable to host attacks. The induction of CD 4 +CD 25 +Foxp 3 + T cells through metacestode E/S-products suggests that these cells fulfill an important role for parasite persistence during chronic echinococcosis...|$|E
