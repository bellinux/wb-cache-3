50|$|<b>Pit</b> <b>water,</b> {{mine water}} or mining water is water that {{collects}} in a mine {{and which has}} {{to be brought to}} the surface by water management methods in order to enable the mine to continue working.|$|E
50|$|The pit and {{its water}} present a serious {{environmental}} problem because the water, with dissolved oxygen, allows pyrite and sulfide minerals in the ore and wall rocks to decay, releasing acid. When the <b>pit</b> <b>water</b> level eventually reaches the natural water table, estimated to occur by around 2020, the <b>pit</b> <b>water</b> will reverse flow back into surrounding groundwater, polluting into Silver Bow Creek {{which is the}} headwaters of Clark Fork River. The acidic water in the pit carries a heavy load of dissolved heavy metals. In fact, the water contains so much dissolved metal (up to 187 ppm Cu) that some material is mined directly from the water.|$|E

50|$|On November 28, 2016 several {{thousand}} snow geese died after a large flock {{landed in the}} <b>pit's</b> <b>water</b> to avoid a snow storm. Although an official count is incomplete as of early December 2016, the total {{is expected to be}} many times greater than the earlier 1995 incident. Immediately after the event, officials made efforts to scare birds away and prevent more from landing in the area.|$|R

50|$|In 1823, coal {{began to}} be coked in Burgk and, from 1828, the first gas was produced. As a result, Burgk, became the first village {{in the world to}} have public gas lighting. In 1842, the first Saxon {{smelting}} furnace entered service. It was located in the area of Burgk iron works. In order to extract the large quantities of <b>water</b> from the <b>pits,</b> <b>water</b> management structures had to be built, such as the Tiefe-Weißeritz-Stolln (1800-1838) and the Tiefe Elbstolln (1817-1836).|$|R
50|$|The {{engine shed}} {{was not just}} a {{building}} for housing locomotives. It was a combined 'stable', workshop, office and servicing area, often with living accommodation integrated. There were external locomotive facilities such as cleaning <b>pits,</b> <b>water</b> cranes and nearby coaling bunkers. Inside there were sanding facilities. There was a work table and vice, an office with the duty roster, regulations, operating instructions and other reference material as well as clothes lockers and washing facilities for the staff. Oil was kept in the cellar.|$|R
50|$|The Hüttenstollen, also Straßberger Hüttenstollen, was {{the central}} {{drainage}} adit in the Straßberg mining field and was {{also part of the}} Lower Harz Pond and Ditch System in the Harz Mountains of Germany. The adit lies at a depth of 50 m and is 750 m long. The <b>pit</b> <b>water</b> was drained into the Selke. The drainage ditches were the Straßberger Flösse and the Stollgraben.|$|E
50|$|Although all {{water that}} enters pit {{workings}} originates from atmospheric precipitation, the miner distinguishes between surface water and groundwater. Surface water enters the pit through {{openings in the}} mine at {{the surface of the}} ground, such as tunnel portals or shaft entrances. During heavy rain, water seeps into the earth and forms ground water when it meets layers of impervious rock. <b>Pit</b> <b>water</b> is mainly interstitial water and groundwater that seeps into the mine workings.|$|E
50|$|The {{most recent}} {{development}} in the clean-up was {{the construction of a}} treatment plant on Horseshoe Bend. This facility treats and diverts water coming from the Horseshoe Bend flow. In addition, {{it will be able to}} treat the existing Berkeley <b>Pit</b> <b>water</b> in 2018, or whenever the water level hits the critical point of 5410 ft above sea level. This number was set by federal order and is intended to protect the ground water from being contaminated by the water in the pit.|$|E

40|$|Breach and {{subsequent}} decant of an acidic brackish pit {{lake in the}} Collie Coal region in south-western Australia occurred during flooding of a pre-mining diverted eutrophic river. Inflowing fresher river water with high alkalinity and nutrient concentrations settled over more saline and acidic <b>pit</b> lake <b>water.</b> This created a halocline with better mixoliminion water quality and monimolimnion water quality typical of the pre-breach lake. Flow-through may represent the best long-term mine closure option for this and other pit lakes {{in the state and}} internationally where <b>pit</b> lake <b>water</b> quality degrades over time when excised from regional water systems...|$|R

50|$|In 1995, a {{flock of}} {{migrating}} geese landed in the Berkeley <b>Pit</b> <b>water</b> and died. A total of 342 carcasses were recovered. ARCO, the custodian of the pit, denied that the toxic water caused {{the death of the}} geese, attributing the deaths to an acute aspergillosis infection that may have been caused by a grain fungus, as substantiated by Colorado State University necropsy findings. These findings were disputed by the State of Montana {{on the basis of its}} own lab tests. Necropsies showed their insides were lined with burns and festering sores from exposure to high concentrations of copper, cadmium, and arsenic.|$|E

50|$|In their heyday, {{the mines}} of the Upper Harz {{were among the}} deepest in the world. For example, as early as 1700, shaft depths of 300 metres were {{exceeded}} and, around 1830, a depth of 600 metres was attained; this was now so deep that the mine was actually below sea level - something which was considered significant at that time. Deep shafts, however, demanded correspondingly high levels of energy to lift ore and <b>pit</b> <b>water.</b> This high energy consumption, combined with the heavy demand for water, led to even more strenuous attempts to develop the available water power.|$|E
50|$|In {{recent years}} the city, along with its neighbors Coleraine and Taconite, has been under a serious threat of {{flooding}} from the nearby Canisteo Mine Pit. The pit, which comprises a series of 19 mines that ceased to be worked in 1985, {{has now become a}} lake some 4.8 miles long and up to 300 ft deep. In June 2011 the water level was recorded as having reached 1316.1 feet above sea level, higher than low-lying areas of the town. A project to drain some of the lake to prevent it overflowing and swamping the town was due to commence in mid-2011. The most recent <b>pit</b> <b>water</b> level is 1316.60 MSL.|$|E
50|$|Northern Nevada has {{a limited}} supply of surface water which is {{considered}} a precious commodity, however large amounts of water can be found underground. At the Pipeline, <b>pit</b> <b>water</b> is pumped from aquifers where it is pumped to ranch land to be reintroduced into the groundwater supply. The mine keeps two streams of water, a contact water stream in which the water has {{come into contact with}} the mining operation, and a non-contact water stream where the water has not come into contact with the mining operation. The 'contact water stream is recycled and reused in the mining operation where the noncontact water is pumped off site.|$|E

5000|$|Low neutron {{activation}} - {{when exposed to}} neutron radiation during the microsecond of active detonation of a nuclear <b>pit,</b> <b>water</b> does not [...] "activate", or become radioactive. The two atoms in water, hydrogen and oxygen, can absorb an extra neutron, becoming deuterium and oxygen-17 respectively, {{both of which are}} stable isotopes. Even oxygen-18 is stable. Radioactive atoms can result if a hydrogen atom absorbs two neutrons, an oxygen atom absorbs three neutrons, or oxygen-16 undergoes a high energy neutron (n-p) reaction to produce a short lived nitrogen-16. In any typical scenario the probability of such multiple capture in significant numbers in the short time of active nuclear reactions around a bomb are very low. They are somewhat greater when the water is continuously irradiated, as in the closed loop of a nuclear reactor.|$|E
