500|$|The game's {{multi-platform}} crossover {{was justified}} {{by emphasizing the}} Xbox 360's success in the North American and European markets, labeling the move as [...] "natural". The final game uses Capcom's internally developed MT Framework engine. In a thread questioning the move on the official Capcom message board, the company's senior director of strategic <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>research,</b> Christian Svensson, responded by {{saying that they were}} moved by people's strong feelings about the decision, but that it was the best decision for the company and consumers. He also claimed that the contents would be identical, except that [...] "the feel of the controller" [...] may cause a slight difference.|$|E
500|$|The {{magazine}} was co-founded in 2003 by Nicole Vogel {{and her brother}} journalist Scott Vogel, and began as a glossy magazine {{with a focus on}} the lifestyle of Portland. Nicole Vogel had previously been a vice president at Cendant Corporation, and had worked at Time Warner for five years and was a vice president at CNN. Scott Vogel had previously worked as a journalist for The New York Times. The niche market focus of the {{magazine was}} for [...] "25- to 65-year-olds with household incomes of at least $100,000". Nicole Vogel used Texas Monthly as one of her models for the magazine, which she had read growing up in Texas. <b>Planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>research</b> for the magazine included conducting 200 interviews with residents of Portland, in addition to raising US$40,000 from angel investors.|$|E
500|$|In April 1949, General Ennis Whitehead was put {{in charge}} of CONAC. He devised his own command methods rather than those {{established}} by Saville, making Saville redundant in his role as air defense chief. In support of Saville, Colonel Jacob E. Smart, assistant to USAF Commander Henry H. Arnold, wrote that Saville's unorthodox methods since the end of World War II provided [...] "the only tangible results toward building an air defense system" [...] of any worth. Smart said that Saville, though a [...] "thorn in the side to many people", should be credited for all recent air defense progress in the U.S. Saville was moved from air defense operations to long-range <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>research.</b> In September 1949, Arnold appointed Saville head of the newly established Directorate of Requirements in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations at USAF headquarters. The following January, Saville became deputy chief of staff for Development, Air Research and Development Command, a new staff section at USAF headquarters. To equip the U.S. with a fighter that could defend against the new threat of Soviet nuclear bombers, Saville initiated a design competition for a fire-control system (FCS) codenamed MX-1179, the basis of a guided air-to-air missile system simple enough that it could be operated alone by the pilot of a supersonic fighter rather than by a weapons officer. The proposed fighter concept was referred to as the 1954 interceptor, resulting directly in the 1956 Convair F-102 Delta Dagger, and several other fighter models indirectly. Saville was less concerned with the aircraft details than with the weapons system; regarding the FCS he said, [...] "when that system is developed, we're going to put aluminum around it, engines on it, and a pilot to run the aluminum, and that is the interceptor." ...|$|E
