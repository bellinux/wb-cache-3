40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{question}} of what factors in development <b>policy</b> create specific <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> capacity and under what circumstances developmentoriented complementarities or mismatches between {{the public and private sectors}} emerge. We argue that specific <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> capacity emerge from three interlinked policy choices, each fundamentally evolutionary in nature: policy choices on understanding the nature and sources of technical change and innovation; on the ways of financing economic growth, in particular technical change; and on the nature of public management to deliver and implement both previous sets <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> choices. Thus, policy capacity is not so much a continuum of abilities (from less to more), but rather a variety of modes <b>of</b> making <b>policy</b> that originate from co-evolutionary processes in capitalist development. To illustrate, we briefly reflect upon how the East Asian developmental states of the 1960 s- 1980 s and Eastern European transition policies since the 1990 s led to almost opposite institutional systems for financing, designing and managing development strategies, and how this led, through co-evolutionary processes, to different <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> capacity...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores {{a rather}} new and {{somewhat}} colloquial style of polite language in Japanese, which will mostly {{be referred to}} as the semi-polite or nai desu form. In most grammars and textbooks we are usually taught that the negative <b>plain</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> the verb taberu eat is tabenai not eat and the negative polite form is tabemasen. For the semi-polite form we add the politeness marker desu to the negative <b>plain</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> the verb, giving us tabenai desu. The semi-polite or nai desu form is thus a grammaticalized hybrid of the <b>plain</b> and polite <b>forms,</b> where the politeness marker desu, which was originally used to make adjectives polite, has spread to verbal negatives. It is semi-polite in that it is less polite than the standard polite form used in more formal settings or between strangers, yet more polite than the <b>plain</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> speech generally used at home or with one s close friends etc. The semi-polite nai desu form seems to have been gaining popularity in the last decades. This study thus investigates the distribution of masen and nai desu forms in verbs, adjectives and copula. Previous studies and my corpus analysis show that there are some general tendencies that affect the choice of masen or nai desu forms. In written materials, masen is preferred, however in natural speech materials; nai desu forms are more used. Other general tendencies found in these studies include: nai desu is preferred with verbs when sentence final particles are used, but masen is still preferred when not followed by these particles; declarative sentences will have more nai desu forms, while interrogative sentences have more masen forms; nai desu is preferred when negation is emphasized, whereas masen is preferred with modality and other fixed expressions. Levels of formality, and possibly age, also seem to play a role, e. g. there are more nai desu forms in conversations between university students, while in circumstances with higher levels of formality, e. g. in the workplace, masen is preferred. The grammaticalization process of the polite auxiliary verb desu, which has hitherto developed into a semi-polite <b>form</b> <b>of</b> verbal negatives (e. g. tabenai desu), could theoretically spread even further and could possibly someday become a variant form for affirmatives as well (e. g. taberu desu instead of tabemasu). Thus, desu might either replace the masu/masen (affirmative/negative) polite verb endings, or become a variant form on par with masu/masen, or become an established semi-polite level of politeness between polite and <b>plain</b> <b>forms...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{birth of}} the {{croissant}} itself-that is, its adaptation from the <b>plainer</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> Kipferl, before the invention of viennoiseries-can be dated to at least 1839 (some say 1838) when an Austrian artillery officer, August Zang, founded a Viennese bakery ("Boulangerie Viennoise") at 92, rue de Richelieu in Paris. This bakery, which served Viennese specialities including the Kipferl and the Vienna loaf, quickly became popular and inspired French imitators (and the concept, if not the term, of viennoiserie, a 20th-century term for supposedly Vienna-style pastries). The French version of the Kipferl was named for its crescent (croissant) shape and has become an identifiable shape across the world.|$|R
