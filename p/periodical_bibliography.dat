[...] Boston University, 1950 Problem: In {{the modern}} {{secondary}} school where programs are being altered {{to fit the}} needs of the students, the science courses still provide little at the secondary level for supplementary reading. This study seeks to find and justify supplementary, up-to-date science articles in the popular periodicals which will fill this need. It further seeks to make a useful catalogue of these articles with brief annotations of each for the convenience of secondary school science teachers who may be interested in using such a source. The articles are catalogued under both a topic heading for possible use in unit teaching and cross-referenced under a subject index. 	Scope and limitations of study: 1. Study is limited to reading activity for supplementing high school science. 2. Periodicals, rather than auxiliary texts, are considered for up-to-dateness, reality, and interest. 3. The periodical selection is based on circulation, availability in high school and town libraries and popularity among high school students and teachers. 4. The periodicals selected are Reader's Digest, Life Magazine, Popular Science, Popular Mechanics and National Geographic Magazine. 5. The periodicals are studied for the two year period January 1948 through December l 949. 6. All articles of possible value to high school science teachers are listed and annotated. 	Procedure : 	A survey of modern education texts shows that extensive science reading is highly praised and little used. This study proposes a supplementary reading program which will be more than simply double-checking in another text; but which will bring reality, interest and up-to-dateness into the classroom by using popular periodicals. 	By carefully examining Gregory's Union List of Serials, Ayer's directory of Newspapers and Periodicals and Articles and Studies found by using the Education Guide and Education Index, the author selected the periodicals which were read and preferred by both high- school teachers and high-school students and which were generally available and highly circulated. 	The articles over a two- year period 1848 -l 849 were catalogued and annotated and listed under convenient topic headings. The topic heading were selected after examining both the concept-divided projects for unit method teaching and the standard texts which have for years followed the chapter headings in chemistry and physics books. In selecting the topic headings the most important consideration was to make the catalogue as practical as possible. 	A subject index was also devised and included as a cross-reference to the annotated bibliography of articles which make up {{the main body of the}} work. 	Recommendations and suggestions for use of the catalogue are included. 	Major findings and conclusions: 1. In a two-year period 775 articles of possible use in high school science are found. 2. These articles, complete with details of author, periodical, name, date, and volume and descriptive annotation are catalogued in the work. 3. A convenient list of topic head 1 ngs is arranged so as to be of value to teachers using different methods of approach. 4. A subject index as cross-reference is included. 5. Recommendations for use of catalogue. a) A quick reference list for teachers for keeping up in science. b) Selections of topics for possible science projects. c) A <b>periodical</b> <b>bibliography</b> for students on projects. d) A general science reading list for students. e) A basis for teachers to construct a science-abstract file. f) A partial means of developing unit-science teaching. g) A springboard for science research in other periodicals. 	Criticisms and suggestions for further study: 1. Because of current nature of a study like this one, it is suggested that annual supplements to keep the catalogue up to date would, give it a long-run value. 2. Later studies of article and periodical preference might indicate sources not considered here. 5. Supplementary reading material for special purposes could be found in other periodicals. 4. The topic division which is made here may not be adequate since information in this field is scarce. Future studies and research in topic division should be considered in cataloguing science articles. 5. Articles of long-range value which were published before the period covered in this study would make a worth while project...|$|E
