25|$|An {{example of}} a {{successful}} application of the CCU method {{can be found at}} Exact Software (ES). ES is a manufacturer of accounting and enterprise resource planning software based in the Netherlands. ES has combined <b>Product</b> <b>Data</b> Management (PDM), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Software Configuration Management (SCM) {{in order to maintain the}} configuration at the customer site in a better and less complex way. ES has a module in its CRM software that contains all contracts of each customer. This is linked to their PDM system. Every contract corresponds to files that can be downloaded for a new version or update of a previous version. In the delivery phase this means that the customers are able to obtain all the products through an online connection. So ES sells contracts (licenses) and stores them into their CRM system, the delivery of the actual products can be done by the customers themselves completely automated requiring little effort. The PDM system is on its turn linked to the SCM system which keeps track of the configurations the customers are using. In the delivery phase this means that ES is able to automatically determine the customer needs whenever a customer does a request.|$|E

Additionally, {{there is a need}} to create Complex products (packages) which can contain onz or more of the simple products, along with descriptive information about the package itseif. The ability to track both types of these <b>data</b> <b>products</b> is crucial for providing visibility of in-process status along the <b>data</b> <b>product</b> pipeline between space and ground.

[...] In practice however, in both fields of open-source hardware and open-source software, products may either be the result of a development process performed by a closed team in a private setting or by a community in a public environment, the first case being more frequent than the second which is more challenging. Establishing a community-based product development process faces several challenges such as: to find appropriate <b>product</b> <b>data</b> management tools, document not only the product but also the development process itself, accepting losing ubiquitous control over the project, ensure continuity in a context of fickle participation of voluntary project members, among others.|$|E
