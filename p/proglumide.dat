40|$|Abstract. Previous {{studies have}} {{revealed}} a stimulatory action of cholecystokinin on growth hormone release in the rat. To evaluate the physiologic {{significance of these}} effects we employed the cholecystokinin antagonist, <b>proglumide</b> and injected it intravenously and intraventricularly (third cerebral ventricle, 3 V) to determine its actions on growth hormone. The experiments were performed in conscious, freely moving rats with indwelling cannulae in the 3 V and/or external jugular vein. Intraventricular injection of 2 or 10 µg of <b>proglumide</b> significantly elevated plasma growth hormone concentrations in intact and castrated male rats and in ovariectomized females. Intravenous injections of 10 or 100 µg of <b>proglumide</b> were also effective in elevating growth hormone in a dose-related manner. Surprisingly, {{the response to the}} lower dose given intraventricularly was somewhat greater than that of the higher dose. We speculate that these stimulatory effects of <b>proglumide</b> given intraventricularly are due to the agonist action of <b>proglumide</b> at these doses since action of cholecystokinin itself is to increase plasma growth hormone following its intraventricular injection. The studies therefore do not establish a physiologically significant growth hormone-releasing action of brain cholecystokinin but provide more evidence that activation of cholecystokinin receptors in the brain can induce a stimulation of growth hormone release either by activation of the release of growth hormone-releasing hormone or by inhibition of the release of somatostatin or by a combination of these two actions...|$|E

The animals were observed daily for neurobehavioral abnormalities including dyskinetic head movements, circling, tail hanging, air righting reflex, locomotor activity, and contact inhibition of the righting reflex. After behavioral studies, blood and brain samples were collected {{for the analysis of}} malondialdehyde (MDA), conjugated dienes, vitamin E, and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). The temporal bones were also collected for inner ear histopathology. Our results showed that <b>proglumide</b> significantly and dose-dependently exacerbated the incidence and the severity of IDPN-induced ECC syndrome during the treatment period as well as up to 3 weeks of postdosing. Administration of IDPN produced a significant increase in MDA and conjugated dienes and a decrease in vitamin E and GSH-Px, suggesting the role of oxygen-derived free radicals (ODFR) in IDPN-induced neurotoxicity. Concomitant treatment with <b>proglumide</b> potentiated IDPN-induced oxidative stress. The histopathology of the inner ear showed significantly high degeneration of sensory hair cells in the crista ampullaris of the rats treated with IDPN plus <b>proglumide</b> compared to IDPN-alone-treated animals.

First, the effects of CCK- 8 and <b>proglumide</b> upon passive avoidance behavior was investigated. Rats were trained to avoid a darkened chamber by presenting electrical footshock (two seconds of intensity levels) inside the chamber. Directly following the footshock, injections of CCK- 8 or <b>proglumide</b> were given, with avoidance behavior measured 24 hours following the injection. CCK- 8 was found to produce reductions in the passive avoidance latency at doses ranging from 30 ug/Kg to 500 ug/Kg.

The CCK- 8 effect was found when the current was at 0. 25 mA, but at no other current setting tested. <b>Proglumide</b> (5 mg/Kg) was found to block the CCK- 8 effect upon passive avoidance behavior. A lower dose of <b>proglumide</b> (2 mg/Kg) was found to produce reductions in the passive avoidance latency. These results suggest that CCK- 8 {{may play a role in}} passive avoidance conditioning in rats. The effects of CCK- 8 upon an appetitively conditioned behavior were then investigated. Rats were trained to locate and drink from a drinking tube that contained a 10 percent sucrose solution. Following 30 seconds exposure to the solution, injections of CCK- 8 were given, with the latency to begin drinking from the tube measured 24 hours later. CCK- 8 was found to produce increases in the latency to begin drinking, at doses of 20 ug/Kg and 100 ug/Kg. CCK- 8 also produced a reduction in the amount of sucrose solution consumed during the test period. When CCK- 8 was given following exposure to regular tap water, no increase in drinking latency or reduction in consumption was found. These results suggest that CCK- 8 can act as an aversive stimulus and is capable of producing conditioned taste aversions.

In this study, we investigated interactions between 5 -HT and CCK into the LPBN to control water and NaCl intake. Male Holtzman rats with cannulas implanted bilaterally in the LPBN were treated with furosemide + captopril to induce water and NaCl intake. Bilateral LPBN injections of high doses of the 5 -HT antagonist methysergide (4 mug) or the CCK antagonist <b>proglumide</b> (50 mug), alone or combined, produced similar increases in water and 1. 8 % NaCl intake.

40|$|Introduction: Recent {{studies have}} shown that cold water {{swimming}} stress (CWSS) produces analgesia. Although exact mechanism of the analgesia is until unclear, it may attributed to CCK receptors. On the other hand, the effectiveness of analgesic drugs for treatment of neuropathic pain is limited. In the present study, the effects of CCK receptor agonist caerulein and antagonist <b>proglumide,</b> both alone and together on the CWSS- induced analgesia was investigated and compared in normal mice and those whose sciatic nerve was ligated. Material & Methods: In this research, fifty groups of nine male albino mice were used. As a model of neuropathy, the unilateral nerve ligation was made by a surgical procedure on the right hind limb. Pain sensitivity was measured by the hot plate test. Results: Different CWSS regimes (0. 5 - 3 min) induced time-dependent analgesia. Nerve ligation did not alter the CWSS induced analgesia. Caerulein (0. 025, 0. 05 and 0. 1 mg/kg) induced analgesia in both nerve ligated and intact animals. Different doses of <b>proglumide</b> (20, 40 and 60 mg/kg) alone produced analgesic effect. The response of caerulein was not inhibited by <b>proglumide.</b> In the stressed mice, both drugs and the combination of them showed analgesia but there appeared to be no potentiation in CWSS- induced analgesia.

40|$|Cholecystokinin exerts a {{composite}} influence on gastrointestinal motility but {{little is known}} about its effect on small-intestinal slow waves. Thus, six rams were implanted with four bipolar serosal electrodes onto the duodeno-jejunal wall. In the course of chronic experiments the myoelectric activity was continuously recorded in the non-fasted animals. After recording of the full normal migrating myoelectric complex (MMC), 0. 15 M NaCl or CCK peptides were injected intravenously during various phases of the next MMC cycle. Five mℓ of saline was injected over 30 s during phases 1, 2 a, or 2 b of the MMC. Cerulein was administered at doses of 1 (over 30 s), 10 (over 30 or 60 s), or 100 ng/kg (over 30, 60, 120 or 300 s) and cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-OP) at doses 20 times higher. CCK peptides were applied during early or late phase 1 of the MMC and during phases 2 a and 2 b of the MMC. In the course of additional experiments, saline and hormone administration was directly preceded by infusion of <b>proglumide,</b> an unspecific CCK receptor antagonist, at a dose of 10 mg/kg. The myoelectric recordings were continued until the arrival of a subsequent regular phase 3 of theMMC. In the duodenal bulb, slow waves were occasionally observed. In the duodenum the slow-wave frequency oscillated between 20 and 24 cpm and in the jejunum between 19 and 22 cpm before or after CCK peptides and <b>proglumide.</b> In the duodenum the slow-wave amplitude increased significantly after all doses of cerulein injected during phase 2 b of the MMC. After administration of CCK-OP changes in duodenal slow-wave amplitude were not significant but exhibited a tendency similar to those after cerulein. In the jejunum, injection of cerulein and CCK-OP during phase 2 of the MMC increased the slow-wave amplitude significantly and the duration of these changes was longer than in the duodenum. After infusion of <b>proglumide,</b> administration of cerulein at the low dose over 30 s and at the high dose over 300 s in the course of late phase 1 and phases 2 a and 2 b of the MMC, significantly increased the duodenal slow-wave amplitude.

Perfusion with cholecystokinin- 8 (100 microM but not 1 microM or 10 nM) increased the dialysate levels of dopamine without affecting those of DOPAC or HVA. At low concentrations (1 microM and 10 nM but not 1 nM), cholecystokinin- 8 counteracted the inhibitory effect of apomorphine (0. 05 mg/kg, s. c.) on dopamine release. This counteraction was antagonized by perfusion with the cholecystokinin- 8 antagonist <b>proglumide</b> (3 microM). At this concentration, <b>proglumide</b> perfused alone was without effect on basal or apomorphine-reduced levels of dopamine. The results indicate a facilitatory effect of cholecystokinin- 8 on dopamine release in rat neostriatum only at high concentrations.

One month after reopening the closed pancreaticobiliary duct (PBD), the pancreas showed regeneration of acinar cells, and the above-mentioned parameters were significantly lower than in the control group.

The administration of <b>proglumide</b> (20 mg/kg i. p.), a cholecystokinin receptor antagonist, accelerated pancreatic regeneration and approached all these parameters to control values one month after reopening the closed PBD. The present study suggests that the beneficial effects of SS on established pancreatitis induced by PBDL may not be due to a direct action of the peptide on pancreatic acinar cells at least at 14 hours after PBDL. In addition, these findings suggest that in established pancreatitis the effect of <b>proglumide</b> on the SS receptor-adenylate cyclase system could be due to its action on pancreatic regeneration.

40|$|The hormone gastrin exerts a growth-promoting {{effect on}} {{gastrointestinal}} cells. The molecular {{mechanisms by which}} colonic epithelial cells respond to gastrin are still poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate a novel feature of the action of gastrin on normal colonic cells, namely the rapid phosphorylation on tyrosine of phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC gamma 1, elicited by gastrin, was transient, concentration-dependent, and was abrogated by pretreating the colonic cells with the gastrin-receptor antagonist <b>proglumide,</b> the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, and by removal of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate from the isolation buffer. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC gamma 1 correlated with the time- and concentration-dependent decrease in the mass of membrane phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2) {{and the increase in}} the epithelial concentration of inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3). Likewise, the stimulated increase in IP 3 was also prevented by <b>proglumide</b> and genistein. Gastrin induced a definite but transient increase in the intracellular concentration of free Ca 2 + [Ca 2 +]i, and increased membrane-translocation of immunoreactive alpha- and beta-protein kinase C. The data thus indicate that gastrin elicits at least one signalling cascade, through rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC gamma 1, leading to the activation of a PIP 2 -specific PLC pathway...|$|E
40|$|An {{intraperitoneal}} (i. p.) {{injection of}} pentagastrin (250 micrograms/kg, three times daily) for 1 week increased somatostatin like-immunoreactivity (SSLI) {{content in the}} pancreas {{and the number of}} somatostatin (SS) receptors in pancreatic acinar membranes without influencing their apparent affinity as compared with control animals. No significant differences were seen in basal or forskolin (FK) -stimulated adenylate cyclase (AC) enzyme activities in the control and pentagastrin treated rats. In spite of {{the increase in the number}} of SS receptors, SS caused a significantly lower inhibition in AC activity in these membranes. This finding is related to the fact that the stable GTP analogue, 5 '-guanylylimidodiphosphate (Gpp[NH]p) was a much less potent inhibitor of binding in the pancreatic acinar cell membranes from pentagastrin-treated animals than in those from controls. In addition the ability of Gpp(NH) p to inhibit FK-stimulated AC activity was also decreased in pancreatic acinar cell membranes from pentagastrin-treated rats. Pretreatment with <b>proglumide,</b> (20 mg/kg i. p.) a gastrin/cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist, prevented the pentagastrin-induced changes in SS level and binding as well as the inhibitory effect of SS on AC activity in pancreatic acinar cell membranes. <b>Proglumide</b> alone had no observable effect on the somatostatinergic system. These data suggest a SS receptor/G protein uncoupling as a result of binding of pentagastrin to gastrin receptors present in pancreatic acinar cell membranes...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate the role of cholecystokinin (CCK) on the food-induced insulin sensitization phenomenon in healthy Long Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) and Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats. Whole body insulin sensitivity determined by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic glucose clamping and the rapid insulin sensitivity test served as endpoints. Determinations were done in both fasted and re-fed animals. The involvement of CCK in post-prandial insulin sensitization was assessed by using <b>proglumide,</b> a CCK receptor blocker, by assessment of hypothalamic CCK- 1 /CCK- 2 receptor expression by rt-PCR technique and by plasma insulin immunoreactivity determinations by means of radioimmunoassay as pharmacological, genetic and analytical approaches, respectively. The body weight of the OLETF rats and the amount of food consumed much exceeded those seen with LETO rats. The post-prandial increase in insulin sensitivity was marked in LETO, but not in OLETF rats. Intravenous <b>proglumide</b> attenuated post-prandial insulin sensitivity in LETO rats, with no effect in OLETF rats. Nevertheless, baseline insulin sensitivity was much lower in OLETF than in LETO rats. Treatment with rosiglitazone increased baseline insulin sensitivity of OLETF rats and evoked an increase in CCK- 1 receptor gene expression in LETO rats. The results provide evidence for the involvement of CCK receptors in adjustment of both fasting and post-prandial insulin sensitivity. The data obtained with OLETF rats strongly suggest the predominant role of CCK- 1 receptor...|$|E
40|$|Inhibition {{of colon}} {{carcinoma}} cell growth by the nonselective gastrin/cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists <b>proglumide</b> and benzotript provided evidence that gastrin functions as an autocrine growth factor. However, the molecular {{properties of the}} receptor mediating the antagonist effects have not been identified. A 78 -kDa gastrin-binding protein (GBP), the sequence of which {{is related to the}} family of enzymes possessing enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3 -hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities, has been previously purified from porcine gastric mucosal membranes. I now report that covalent cross-linking of 125 I-labeled [Nle 15]gastrin 2, 17 to the 78 -kDa GBP is inhibited by crotonyl-CoA and by acetoacetyl-CoA. Gastrin, CCK, and their analogues also inhibit cross-linking, and the spectrum of analogue affinities correlates better with the values previously reported for binding to the gastrin/CCK-C receptor than with the values reported for binding to either the CCK-A or the gastrin/CCK-B receptor. Cross-linking is also inhibited by <b>proglumide</b> and benzotript, but no inhibition is seen with either the CCK-A receptor-selective antagonist L 364, 718 or the gastrin/CCK-B receptor-selective antagonist L 365, 260. The affinities of antagonists for the GBP correlate well with their affinities for the gastrin/CCK-C receptor and with their potencies for inhibition of colon carcinoma cell growth. I conclude that the 78 -kDa gastrin-binding protein is (i) a member of the hydratase/dehydrogenase family of fatty acid oxidation enzymes, (ii) the gastrin/CCK-C receptor, and (iii) the target for the antiproliferative action of two gastrin/CCK receptor antagonists...|$|E
