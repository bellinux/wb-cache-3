Physicochemical parameters such as water activity, color, expansion ratio, bulk density, lipid content, and <b>peroxide</b> <b>values</b> of extruded snack were analyzed. Scanning electron micrographs were taken. <b>Peroxide</b> <b>values</b> and propanal contents were measured over four months of storage. Rancidity scores of extruded snack were measured using a trained panel. As expected, omega- 3 fatty acids and bulk density increased with increasing flaxseed fortification levels. Extrudates with more flaxseed had decreased lightness values and expansion ratios. However, only the 15 and 20 % flaxseed containing extrudates had expansion ratios that were significantly (P≤ 0. 05) different from the control. In general, no significant difference (P> 0. 05) in water activity values was observed in the flaxseed fortified extrudates, except in the navy-corn based extrudates. <b>Peroxide</b> <b>values</b> increased with increased flaxseed levels and over a storage period. However, propanal values did not change significantly in the 5 – 10 % flaxseed fortified extrudates but increased in extrudates {{with higher levels of}} flaxseed.

Fresh mayonnaise samples were examined by sensory analysis (analytical descriptive test) and physico-chemical analyses (pH, acid and <b>peroxide</b> <b>values)</b> first after being stored for one month and then after two months. The effects of individual factors were examined and the results were statistically valued. The results show that fresh standard mayonnaise containing 75 % of oil as opposed to low-fat mayonnaise (light mayonnaise containing 49 % of oil) gained higher grades for most sensory attributes. Storage temperature, storage time and type of mayonnaise influence significantly (P≤ 0. 001) the stability, homogeneity, mouth feeling, acid odour and flavour, rancidity, pH, acid and <b>peroxide</b> <b>values.</b> At any point of storage and under both temperature regimes, the samples of light mayonnaise had lower pH value and higher acid value in comparison with standard mayonnaise.

50|$|A {{qualitative}} {{aspect to}} be considered is the significant deterioration {{in the quality of}} the oil extracted from olives with a high percentage of attacks by larvae of the third stage. The oil obtained from infected olives has a high acidity level (expressed as oleic acid, from 2% to 10% depending on the percentage of the infestation) and a lower shelf life as it has a higher <b>peroxide</b> <b>value.</b> Secondarily qualitative impairments of varying severity derive from the olive fruit fly attacks due to the arrival of mold through the eclosions.

5000|$|One {{parameter}} used to characterise an oil is its acidity. In this context, [...] "acidity" [...] is not chemical acidity in {{the sense}} of pH, but the percent (measured by weight) of free oleic acid. Measured by quantitative analysis, acidity {{is a measure of the}} hydrolysis of the oil's triglycerides: as the oil degrades, more fatty acids are freed from the glycerides, increasing the level of free acidity and thereby increasing hydrolytic rancidity. Another measure of the oil's chemical degradation is the <b>peroxide</b> <b>value,</b> which measures the degree to which the oil is oxidized damaged by free radicals, leading to oxidative rancidity. Phenolic acids present in olive oil also add acidic sensory properties to aroma and flavor.|$|E

The results (i.e. the absorbance data for every tested wavelength) are thus processed by a statistical algorithm, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Partial Least Squares regression (PLS), to estimate the oil acidity. The feasibility to measure olive oil free acidity and <b>peroxide</b> <b>value</b> by NIR spectroscopy in the wavenumber range 4,541 to 11,726 cm−1 was reported. Many commercial spectrophotometers exist [...] that can be used for analysis of different quality parameters in olive oil.

The main drawbacks are the high cost of commercial spectrophotometer and the need of calibration for different types of oil (produced by olives of different varieties, different geographical origin, etc.).|$|E

Detection of peroxide shows an initial evidence of rancidity in unsaturated fats and oils. The double bonds found in essential oils play a role in autoxidation (a free radical reaction involving oxygen that leads to deterioration of oils which form off-flavors and off-odors.).

40|$|Chemical changes {{occurring}} to dietary lipid oxidation compounds {{throughout the}} gastrointestinal tract are practically unkown. In this regard, the first site for potential chemical modifications is the stomach {{due to the}} strong acidic conditions (1). The objective {{of this study was}} the evaluation of potential chemical changes during simulated digestion of safflower oil (SO), a vegetable oil rich in linoleic acid (LA) and of the oil obtained after its alkaline isomerization and commercialized as Tonalin (TO). TO contains about 80 % conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and it is added to a number of commercialized dairy products as a functional lipid especially for its attributed effect of body fat reduction. It is well-known that oils rich in linoleic acid are highly susceptible to oxidation and the compounds formed may be found in the diet at considerable amounts (2). In the case of CLA-rich oils, mechanisms of oxidation are different and lead to formation of polymerization compounds {{from the beginning of the}} oxidation process (3). In this study, samples of SO and TO oxidized at 40 ºC and fractions concentrated in oxidized compounds were subjected to in vitro gastric conditions. A simulated gastric fluid (SGF) containing 0. 03 M NaCl and 3. 2 % w/v pepsin in 0. 1 M HCl (pH 1. 0) was used and samples were stirred with SGF for 3 hours at 37 ºC.
