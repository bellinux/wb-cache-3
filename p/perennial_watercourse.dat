40|$|Southern Nevada {{contains}} {{a wide range}} of topographies, elevations, and climatic zones that are emblematic of its position at the ecotone between the Mojave Desert, Great Basin, and Colorado Plateau ecoregions. These varied environmental conditions support a high degree of biological diversity, but they also provide opportunities for {{a wide range of}} invasive species. In addition, the population center of Las Vegas valley and agricultural areas scattered throughout Clark, Lincoln, and Nye counties, all con-nected by a network of roads and highways, plus ephemeral and <b>perennial</b> <b>watercourses,</b> provide abundant opportunities for new invaders to be transported into and within south-ern Nevada. Invasive species are a major concern for land managers because of their capacity to compete with native species, change habitat conditions, and alter ecosystem properties. Executive Order 13112 issued by President Clinton in 1999 called for the establish-ment of the inter-departmental National Invasive Species Council (NISC) and creation of a national plan to serve as a comprehensive blueprint for Federal actions on invasive species. This plan identifies five strategic goals: prevention, early detection and rapi...|$|R
40|$|The water {{resources}} of the Capitol Reef National Park area include the middle Fremont River, other <b>perennial</b> and ephemeral <b>watercourses,</b> isolated springs, tinajas, and lakes fed by precipitation on surrounding plateaus, as well as ground water in alluvial, basalt, and sedimentary aquifers fed by recharge from precipitation and stream channel losses. The difference between streamflows at Bicknell (79. 2 million m³/yr) and Caineville (67. 8 million m³/yr) {{can be attributed to}} evapotranspiration by riparian vegetation and cultivated crops and ground-water recharge, which exceeds 1. 5 million m³/yr. Regional ground-water movement is eastward from Thousand Lake Mountain and southward along the Waterpocket Fold. Ground-water quality is generally brackish while surface water is fresh, both degrading east of the Waterpocket Fold due to agricultural uses, evapotranspiration and long aquifer residence times.

40|$|Basic surface {{features}} of the Łask Interfluve near Zduńska Wola originated during the Wartanian ice-sheet areal deglaciation. The ice-sheet waning resulted in formation of groups of crevasse landforms such as kame plateaux, kame hillocks, kame terraces and melt-out depressions. The post-Wartanian morphogenesis increased diversity of the relief by rejuvenation of most of buried valleys, by cutting new valleys and raising the interfluve surface with aeolian sheets and dunes. Sand and silt were deposited in melt-out depressions. The depressions had initially functioned as closed depressions and had formed a local base level. They were incorporated into a valley network presumably {{at the end of}} the Vistulian glaciation. Blocks of dead ice melted gradually and it has led to the formation of flattenings in the melt-out depressions bottoms. The flattenings are 2 - 3 m high and have short gentle slopes. These slopes and the slopes of the melt-out depressions are cut with dells and basin-like valleys. Few of the cuttings continue their direction as barely perceptible, shallow flat-floored valleys drained by <b>perennial</b> or intermittent <b>watercourses.</b> In the Holocene eight types of geocomplexes with stable matter and energy structure were formed, as a result od natural processes. Man's influence has led to diversification of the environment which can be represented by 19 types of present-day geocomplexes. The 19 types are characteristic of all the melt-out depressions in the environs of Zduńska Wola, but they display a unique mosaic in each depression. It is noteworthy that the depressions function as groups of homolithic geocomplexes.

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} the {{influence}} of abiotic factors on the distribution of bilharzia intermediate host snails of the family Planorbidae are reviewed. Much of this work is basically descriptive and relatively few {{attempts have been made to}} examine the effects of these factors on snails in their natural habitats - to identify the factors precisely and to measure their critical levels. An account is given of recent studies on Eiomphalaria pfeifferi (Krauss) in two climatically different regions of southeastern Africa, at 6 S 5 m altitude on the eastern Transvaal escarpment and 19 m on the coastal peneplain of northern Zululand. These have shown the species to undergo a similar annual life-cycle of three overlapping generations in both areas. Further, in these areas where the snail has a discontinuous distribution, two abiotic factors, stream geology and water temperature, were found to be important in limiting its distribution. The longitudinal distribution of B. pfeifferi and another host snail Bulinus (Physopsis) globosus (Morelat), extended upstream in a <b>perennial</b> <b>watercourse,</b> the Gladdespruit, on the escarpment only as far as permanently lentic habitats were available. These habitats, usually detached from the channel, characterized the stream's lowest physical zone with its substratum of exposed granite, as opposed to the sandy-bottomed lotic zones upstream. The limit of the snails' occurrence lay close to the junction of these two substratum types. Granite is resistant to erosion but contains soft inclusions which erode more quickly than the hard matrix causing uneven weathering. This results in the formation of depressions in the stream bed (i. e. pools, potholes and backwaters) which provide the permanently lentic conditions necessary for the snails' survival. Temperature recordings made on this plain, upstream of the snails' limit, suggest that the water temperature here exceeded the critical lower levels required for a positive intrinsic rate of natural increase sufficiently often to permit the species to survive here, though not optimally. Above this point however, current velocities are continually in excess of the maximum tolerated (0. 3 m/sec.) so that in this situation at least, current velocity is a dominant factor. A contrasting situation exists on the coastal peneplain of northern Zululand where B. pfeifferi occurs in some lentic habitats and not in others. This discontinuous distribution is shown to be related to the prolonged duration of temperatures above the level for optimal increase. The apparently suitable habitats from which B. pfeifferi was absent were found to be both very shallow and to experience these prolonged high temperatures during spring and early summer. This corresponds to the maturation period of the B. pfeifferi 1 st generation as defined by Appleton (1974) and causes reduced fecundity probably through impaired gonad development. The density of its filial (2 nd) generation is correspondingly reduced. A statistically significant partial-correlation (at a 1 % level) was found between the fecundity of the 1 st generation and increasing periods of temperatures above the species' optimal limit in the habitats involved during its maturation period (spring). It is interesting to nate here that B. (Ph.) globosus, which is known to be better adapted to high temperatures than B. pfeifferi (Shiff & Husting, 1966) occurred in all the waterbodies concerned. Both these factors therefore play important roles in determining the country-wide distribution pattern of the host snails. This distribution is closely correlated with the availability of permanently lentic habitats. In river systems, which form the main environment for these snails, such stable habitats occur almost entirely in low-gradient reaches over hard bed-rock which is resistant to erosion. Current velocities above 0. 3 m/sec. render steeper reaches and those over soft, non-resistant rock and sand (unstable substrata) unsuitable and therefore constitute a most important limiting factor. Temperature however becomes a dominant factor in permanently lentic waterbodies. Biomphalaria pfeifferi is adversely affected by high temperature regimes and where such regimes occur in waterbodies which are too shallow to permit temperature gradient to develop, the species cannot survive whereas B. (Ph.) globosus can do so. This intolerance of high temperature regimes on the part of B. pfeifferi accounts for the species' adoption of a discontinuous distribution over the coastal plain of south-eastern Africa. A comparable pattern has been reported for the species over this plain northwards to approximately 16 °S latitude in Mozambique and is probably due to a similar high-temperature effect. Further northwards in equatorial latitudes B. pfeifferi is restricted to the more elevated and cooler areas above an altitude of 500 - 600 m, probably because the very high temperature regimes prevailing in the lowlands there exclude the species altogether...|$|E
