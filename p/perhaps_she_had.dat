60|$|Then Mrs. Ray spoke out,--as <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{never spoken}} before.|$|E
60|$|It was Susy's voice, {{struggling}} into consciousness. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been instinctively {{conscious of}} the boy's sudden fears.|$|E
60|$|He gently {{drew his}} hand away from me, and sighed as he did it. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{sometimes}} kissed his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "You read it, Uncle John," [...] she said. [...] "There can't be {{anything}} private in Tato's letter, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> explained everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't quite {{understand}} this," [...] said the unfortunate lover, getting {{up from his}} seat. [...] "Very likely <b>she</b> won't <b>have</b> me. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> told you so." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY MOGTON [To GINGER.] Jump into a cab. See if you {{can find}} her. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> been {{detained}} at one of the committee-rooms. Tell her she ought to be here.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him earnestly. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never admitted, even to herself, how fond she had been of this scapegrace cousin.|$|E
60|$|And now {{it entered}} her mind that {{perhaps there was}} some justice in what he said. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> used him a little hardly.|$|E
60|$|Lady Grace sighed. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been {{a trifle}} too daring! She was willing enough, at any rate, {{to let the}} subject drift away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course she}} was a fool. She knows that now, I dare say. And <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> repented. Do you mean to try it again with that girl at Harrington Hall?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She must {{be somewhere}} around," [...] said Anne. [...] "She would never wander far away alone [...] . {{you know how}} timid <b>she</b> is. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> fallen asleep {{in one of the}} rooms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{she is an}} {{interesting}} woman," [...] said my companion, [...] "and a very pretty one, too. Some people wonder why she continues to keep the inn, but <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> to. You know, her husband was murdered." ...|$|R
60|$|Then Anne {{saw what}} a {{misleading}} blunder she had committed towards Loveday in {{playing to the}} yeoman. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> sown the seeds of a quarrel.|$|E
60|$|It {{occurred}} to Mrs. Travers that <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not slept either. Her state {{had been more}} like an imperfect, half-conscious, quivering death. She shuddered at the recollection.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I cannot say; <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{been talking}} about your papa. I {{do not want to}} play at bowls now,' added Plantagenet; 'let us go and see the cows.' ...|$|E
50|$|Suddenly, Mr. Black {{approaches}} Queenie and pointedly asks why {{she stays}} with an abusive brute. She reflects on her situation {{and comes to}} the conclusion that, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> just learned to like the aggressive treatment ("Maybe I Like It This Way").|$|R
60|$|David admires her prodigiously; {{he thinks}} her {{so good that}} she {{will be able to get}} him into heaven, however naughty he is. Otherwise he would {{trespass}} less light-heartedly. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> discovered this; for, as I learn from him, she warned him lately that she is not such a dear as he thinks her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't worry, sir, {{although}} I'll {{admit this}} prolonged absence of Miss Jones is puzzling. But <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> gone {{to call on}} an old friend and will presently return and apologize. I remember her mother-- a remarkable woman, sir--who used to live at the Voltaire. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> {{a lot of friends}} in Chicago, did Mrs. Antoinette Seaver Jones, so it's likely her daughter is looking some of them up." ...|$|R
60|$|She obeyed his {{directions}} very punctually: <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> no {{temptation to}} transgress. Living among clowns and misanthropists, she probably cannot appreciate a better {{class of people}} when she meets them.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps, it was {{the heat}} of the room. <b>Perhaps,</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not {{perfectly}} recovered the nervous shock of seeing the dog killed. Carmina's head sank on good Teresa's shoulder. She had fainted.|$|E
60|$|Indeed {{it is thus}} that Mrs. Dowey enters. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> seen shadows lurking on the blind, and at once {{hooked on}} to Kenneth to impress the visitors. She is quite capable of it.|$|E
25|$|He never {{mentioned}} {{his mother in}} his verses and {{he might not have}} known much about her. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> also <b>had</b> been a slave.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{there is}} no need, O Macumazana. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> been making love to you, and you have turned her away, as, being what you are, and my friend, of course you would do." [...] (It is rather {{inconvenient}} to be set upon such a pedestal at times, but I {{did not attempt to}} assent or to deny anything, much less to enter into explanations.) ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>had</b> no {{idea what}} she should do. If she spoke to a {{policeman}} she did not know what would ensue. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> would <b>have</b> to charge this man and appear in a police-court next day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me, my son," [...] she said, {{approaching}} Hamish, {{and taking}} {{him by the}} hand {{with an air of}} deferential awe, which <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not always used to his father, even when in his moody fits.|$|E
60|$|She turned. It was so strangely {{like that}} former {{occasion}} {{that she had}} a curious bewildered feeling of having passed through the same before; and <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>had,</b> in her dreams. Scarcely conscious, she walked towards the fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hem! <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{good reasons}} for being peaceable!" [...] Sampson knew very well what they were, and that poor Bernstein's {{reputation}} was so hopelessly flawed and cracked, that any sarcasms levelled at Madame Walmoden were equally applicable to her.|$|E
50|$|Olga's son is fine, {{though her}} dog dies. She {{eventually}} rebuilds her life, arranging for joint custody with Mario. Though her friends {{try to set}} her up with men, she shies away from them. One of her friends invites her to a concert where she sees her downstairs neighbour playing in the orchestra. Realizing that <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> misjudged him, <b>she</b> contacts him again and the two attempt a relationship.|$|R
60|$|Lucia, my lovely Lucia, retired into {{a convent}} at Murano after the French {{had left the}} city, and there she still may be, some gentle lady abbess who has perhaps long {{forgotten}} the days when our hearts throbbed together, and when the whole great world seemed so small a thing beside the love which burned in our veins. Or perhaps {{it may not be}} so. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> not forgotten.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your sisters must {{be young}} women now," [...] Rebecca said, {{thinking}} of those girls {{for the first}} time <b>perhaps</b> since <b>she</b> <b>had</b> left them.|$|R
60|$|She {{had said}} her little word, meaning it so well. But <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> done {{more harm than}} good. He did not come again to Eaton Square till after she was gone; but very shortly after that he did so.|$|E
6000|$|She drew away obediently, {{and then}} I thought, What if she cannot find the steps? I started after her, {{to stop at}} the foot of the companion-way. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> gone up. As I stood there, hesitant, I heard her cry softly: ...|$|E
60|$|Of {{course it}} was in the tree, and he had not been there for a week! Why had he not thought of it before? The fault was his, not hers. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> gone away, believing him faithless, or a country boor.|$|E
40|$|Title {{devised by}} cataloguer.; Published in the Canberra Times on 11 December 1994.; Part of the Pryor {{collection}} of cartoons and drawings.; Also available in an electronic version via the Internet at: [URL] A report {{sponsored by the}} ACT Government shows that alcohol-related crime is on the increase in Civic. However, when a teacher talks about 'civic ignorance', <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> another understanding of community values in mind. [...] Information provided by Geoff Pryor...|$|R
60|$|Poor old lady! That {{was only}} {{a couple of weeks before}} the end. I do not suppose she guessed it was so certain or <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> might <b>have</b> been more sentimental.|$|R
5000|$|The Death of Faith (1997) aka Quietly in Their Sleep - Brunetti {{comes to}} the aid of a young nursing sister who is leaving her convent {{following}} the unexpected death of five patients. At first, Brunettis inquiries reveal nothing amiss, and he wonders whether the nun is simply creating a smoke screen to justify abandoning her vocation. But <b>perhaps,</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> stumbled onto something very real and very sinister - something that puts her life in imminent danger.|$|R
