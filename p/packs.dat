5|$|A 2016 {{study by}} Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) found that {{availability}} of lithium and other finite {{materials used in}} the battery <b>packs</b> {{will not be a}} limiting factor for the adoption of electric vehicles. BNEF estimated that battery <b>packs</b> will require less than 1% of the known reserves of lithium, nickel, manganese, and copper through 2030, and 4% of the world’s cobalt. After 2030, the study states that new battery chemistries will probably shift to other source materials, making <b>packs</b> lighter, smaller, and cheaper.|$|E

5|$|Team Ninja {{kept working}} on the Ninja Gaiden project after its release, {{with the aim of}} pushing the action genre and their first such title as far as they could. To this end, they {{released}} downloadable expansions, known as Hurricane <b>Packs,</b> free of charge.

5|$|The game {{does not}} feature an inventory, and neither health <b>packs</b> nor ammo can be stockpiled.

5|$|Additional {{downloadable}} content (DLC) {{has been}} released, with more announced, since the game's launch. Expansions include new maps, weapon upgrades and character customization options.

Incognito has stated that any future development on the incomplete single player campaign would only be released as a separate product, and not as an expansion to the current game. Warhawk updates are free, but expansion <b>packs</b> are sold online for a price. Updates are mandatory installations that must be completed in order to play the game. Expansion <b>packs</b> are optional, and the ability to purchase expansion <b>packs</b> is available within the menu of the game itself, as well as through the PlayStation Store.|$|E

5|$|As {{hunting with}} beagles {{was seen as}} ideal for young people, many of the British public schools {{traditionally}} maintained beagle <b>packs.</b> Protests were lodged against Eton's use of beagles for hunting as early as 1902 but the pack is still in existence today, and a pack used by Imperial College in Wye, Kent was stolen by the Animal Liberation Front in 2001. School and university <b>packs</b> are still maintained by Eton, Marlborough, Wye, Radley, the Royal Agricultural University and Christ Church, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|By 1887 {{the threat}} of {{extinction}} was on the wane: there were 18 beagle <b>packs</b> in England. The Beagle Club was formed in 1890 and the first standard drawn {{up at the same}} time. The following year the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles was formed. Both organisations aimed to further {{the best interests of the}} breed, and both were keen to produce a standard type of beagle. By 1902, the number of <b>packs</b> had risen to 44.|$|E

50|$|The column can {{be filled}} with random dumped <b>packing</b> (creating a random <b>packed</b> column) or with {{structured}} <b>packing</b> sections, which are arranged or stacked (creating a stacked <b>packed</b> column). In the column, liquids tend to wet {{the surface of the}} <b>packing</b> and the vapors pass across this wetted surface, where mass transfer takes place. <b>Packing</b> material can be used instead of trays to improve separation in distillation columns. <b>Packing</b> offers the advantage of a lower pressure drop across the column (when compared to plates or trays), which is beneficial while operating under vacuum. Differently shaped <b>packing</b> materials have different surface areas and void space between the <b>packing.</b> Both of these factors affect <b>packing</b> performance.|$|R

5|$|In Alaska, {{the gray}} wolf {{population}} {{is estimated at}} 6,000–7,000, and can be legally harvested during hunting and trapping seasons, with bag limits and other restrictions. As of 2002, there are 250 wolves in 28 <b>packs</b> in Yellowstone, and 260 wolves in 25 <b>packs</b> in Idaho. The gray wolf received Endangered Species Act (ESA) protection in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan in 1974, and was re-classed from endangered to threatened in 2003. Reintroduced Mexican wolves in Arizona and New Mexico are protected under the ESA and, as of late 2002, number 28 individuals in eight <b>packs.</b> A female wolf shot in 2013 in Hart County, Kentucky by a hunter was the first gray wolf seen in Kentucky in modern times.

40|$|The basic {{characteristic}} of <b>packing</b> {{is to protect}} the product from external factors while the product is delivering to consumers. However, recently <b>packing</b> has become an indispensable aspect of marketing. Because, <b>packing</b> is considered as a silent dealer which directly reaches consumers. <b>Packing</b> {{is one of the most}} important factor of product sales. Consumers assess a product with its <b>packing</b> and make up a purchasing decision accordingly. In addition to its protective function, <b>packing</b> also performs functions such as selling and communication. Recently, firms have begun attaching great importance on <b>packing</b> investments. A high-quality and attractive <b>packing</b> means expenditure. A firm can increase its sales as much as it creates difference with its <b>packing.</b> Therefore, it is required to take a risk of increasing the <b>packing</b> costs for increasing sales. Increasing <b>packing</b> cost is an important factor of prices. In this study, the relation between the <b>packing</b> cost and price has been researched by making regression analysis...|$|R

5|$|Alien: Isolation was {{released}} on 7 October 2014, featuring two pre-order downloadable content missions that allow players to play two scenes from the original film. The first mission, entitled Crew Expendable, features the original crew of the Nostromo and involves the player controlling Ripley, Dallas or Parker attempting to flush the alien creature from the air vents and into the ship's airlock. The second mission, Last Survivor, is set during the film's finale and involves the player controlling Ripley {{as she tries to}} activate the Nostromos self-destruct sequence and reach the escape shuttle. Unlike the first mission, the second mission is only available for players who pre-ordered the game at certain retailers. Upon release, five additional downloadable content <b>packs</b> for the game were periodically released between October 2014 and March 2015. These <b>packs</b> expand the game's Survivor Mode with new characters, challenges, maps, and other features.

5|$|Although wolves {{primarily}} feed {{on medium}} to large sized ungulates, {{they are not}} fussy eaters. Smaller sized animals that may supplement the diet of wolves include marmots, hares, badgers, foxes, weasels, ground squirrels, mice, hamsters, voles and other rodents, as well as insectivores. They frequently eat waterfowl and their eggs. When such foods are insufficient, they prey on lizards, snakes, frogs, rarely toads and large insects as available. In times of scarcity, wolves readily eat carrion, visiting cattle burial grounds and slaughter houses. Cannibalism is not uncommon in wolves: during harsh winters, <b>packs</b> often attack weak or injured wolves, and may eat the bodies of dead pack members. Wolf <b>packs</b> in Astrakhan hunt Caspian seals on the Caspian Sea coastline and some wolf <b>packs</b> in Alaska and Western Canada have been observed to feed on salmon. Humans are rarely, but occasionally preyed upon. Other primates occasionally taken by wolves include grey langurs in Nepal and hamadryas baboons in Saudi Arabia.|$|E

40|$|A newly {{developed}} wet <b>packing</b> method {{has been applied}} to measure the <b>packing</b> densities of blended fine aggregates (each a mixture of fine aggregates of different sizes) and mortars (each a mixture of cement and blended fine aggregate) under the wet condition, with or without superplasticizer added, and with or without compaction applied. For the blended fine aggregates, the conventional dry <b>packing</b> method has also been employed to measure their <b>packing</b> densities under the dry condition and the results show that the <b>packing</b> density of fine aggregate is generally higher under wet condition than under dry condition. For both the blended fine aggregates and mortars, the measured <b>packing</b> densities have been compared to the predicted <b>packing</b> densities by two existing <b>packing</b> models. Good agreement between the measured and predicted <b>packing</b> densities has been achieved with the mean absolute error being 2. 1 % for the blended aggregates and 1. 1 % for the mortars. This {{is the first time that}} the <b>packing</b> densities of mortar samples are directly measured and compared to predictions by <b>packing</b> models to verify the applicability of the wet <b>packing</b> method and the <b>packing</b> models. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
