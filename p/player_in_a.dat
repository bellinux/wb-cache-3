5|$|Backbreaker is a simulation-style American {{football}} game, {{which allows}} the player {{to take control of}} a team of football players and compete against the CPU or another <b>player</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> variety of game modes. The game features 56 built-in teams plus three unlockable teams, and also allows the player to create 32 additional ones for a total of 91 possible teams. It lacks any licensing from the National Football League, {{due to the fact that}} they were not able to negotiate a licensing agreement with the NFL or NFLPA Because of this, the developers emphasized the game's customization tools.|$|E
5|$|Footballers {{generally}} wear identifying {{numbers on}} the backs of their shirts. Originally a team of players wore numbers from 1 to 11, corresponding roughly to their playing positions, but at the professional level this has generally been superseded by squad numbering, whereby each <b>player</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> squad is allocated a fixed number for the duration of a season. Professional clubs also usually display players' surnames or nicknames on their shirts, above (or, infrequently, below) their squad numbers.|$|E
5|$|Leroux {{played at}} the 2012 CONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifying Tournament {{as a member of}} the United States senior {{national}} team. In her second cap for the senior side, Leroux scored five goals in a CONCACAF Olympic qualifying match between the U.S. and Guatemala; the final score of the match was 13–0.

She also tied the single-game record for the national team, equaling previous performances by her teammates Amy Rodriguez and Abby Wambach in 2012 and 2004 respectively.|$|E

5|$|McElhenny was {{inducted}} into State of Washington Sports Hall of Fame in 1963 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1981. As of 2016, his 12 rushing touchdowns in 1950 and 13 in 1951 both remain in the top ten all-time for a Washington <b>player</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single season, and his 28 career rushing touchdowns tie him for sixth in school history.|$|E
5|$|Northampton signed Johnson on {{a two-year}} {{contract}} in July 2010 following the successful loan spell. After signing {{for the club}} on a permanent basis, Johnson's first match was the opening game of the season, in a 3–0 loss against Torquay United. Two months later, he received a straight red card after fouling Simon Clist and lost his appeal, resulting in a one-match ban, missing a 3–1 loss against Oxford United. A week after his suspension, he scored his first goal as a permanent Northampton <b>player</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 2–0 win over Lincoln City. In his first season at Northampton (as a permanent player), he made 41 appearances and scored seven goals.|$|E
5|$|Scarygirl {{places the}} player {{in control of}} a girl who is sent from her home to a far-away city on a rescue mission. The girl is able to jump, grapple, and hover her way though seven game worlds, either alone or with another <b>player</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{cooperative}} multiplayer mode. Combat is handled through combining strings of light and heavy attacks, with grapple-based attacks becoming available once enemies take enough damage. Roundly praised for Jurevicius' art, ScaryGirl received otherwise mixed reviews upon its release. Critics found fault with both the control scheme and its combat system, although boss battles did receive some praise.|$|E

5|$|Striker Luther Blissett {{holds the}} record for Watford appearances, having played 503 matches in all {{competitions}} between 1976 and 1992, and his 415 appearances in The Football League {{during the same period}} is also a club record.

The records for the most league goals in a season is held by Cliff Holton, having scored 42 goals in the 1959–60 season. The highest number of goals scored by a <b>player</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single game at a professional level is the six registered by Harry Barton against Wycombe Wanderers in September 1903.|$|E
5|$|The Firefight game mode was a late {{addition}} to the game. Staffer Tim Williams built a prototype shortly after Halo 3 shipped, placing the <b>player</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> portion of a Halo 3 campaign map and fighting enemies. When development commenced on ODST, William's concept was adopted for the game and refined. Designer Lars Bakken described one advantage of the game mode as providing a more friendly multiplayer environment than hardcore players online. The designers reused the campaign scoring and medal system from Halo 3 to add a competitive edge.|$|E

5|$|The first {{nighttime}} {{football game}} was played in Mansfield, Pennsylvania on September 28, 1892 between Mansfield State Normal and Wyoming Seminary and ended at halftime in a 0–0 tie. The Army-Navy game of 1893 saw the first documented use of a football helmet by a <b>player</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> game. Joseph M. Reeves had a crude leather helmet made by a shoemaker in Annapolis and wore it in the game after being warned by his doctor that he risked death if he continued to play football after suffering an earlier kick to the head.|$|E

This incident allegedly involved armed robbery with a handgun. The police did not name the target of the investigation.|$|E

5|$|British Open Championship Golf is a {{three-dimensional}} (3D) video game that simulates golf, a sport in which players attempt {{to hit a}} ball into a hole with as few strokes as possible. In particular, the game is based on The Open Championship, the oldest tournament in golf. The player may compete as a pre- or self-created amateur golfer or as one of eight celebrity athletes, including Sandy Lyle, Vijay Singh and Ian Baker-Finch. Three modes of play—Practice, Match and Tournament—are available. Practice and Match are non-binding preparatory modes: the former allows the player to practice each hole of a course, and the latter engages the <b>player</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pre-tournament match of stroke play, match play or fourball. In the Tournament mode, the player competes in The Open Championship, which consists of four 18-hole matches.|$|E
5|$|Following Mills' {{appointment}} as manager at York City, Smith signed for his former club, {{by this time}} still playing in the Conference Premier, on 21 October 2010 on a three-month loan {{with a view to}} a permanent transfer.

Smith marked his return when he scored first goal for York with a header from Michael Rankine's left-footed cross in a 3–0 home win over Rotherham in the replay on 17 November 2010.|$|E
