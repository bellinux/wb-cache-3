40|$|Em um serviço especializado de {{hospital}} universitário da cidade de São Paulo, Brasil, ficaram analisados o número de pacientes com calazar atendidos e as localidades onde a parasitose foi adquirida, bem como alguns fatos correlatos. Em período de 12 anos e três meses ocorreu internação de 62 enfermos, configurando a taxa de 0, 91 % em relação a 6. 798 indivíduos. Esse valor e a cifra de óbitos, correspondente a 19, 33 %, representaram a expressividade da doença, que não é incomum e desprovida de gravidade. In {{order to}} figure out basically a situation strictly connected with medical assistance work and also to cooperate with public health authorities, analysis of patients with kala-azar was made in a specialized ward of a university hospital {{of the city of}} S. Paulo (Brazil). The patients, the locale where their <b>protozoosis</b> was acquired, and related data were analyzed. This study was made of patients hospital registered in 12 years and 3 months. Sixty-two were bearers of kala-azar, at a rate of 0. 91 % {{out of a total of}} 6, 798 hospitalized patients. Sixty-two were bearers of kala-azar, 0. 91 % of the total. Mortality was 19. 3 %. Both figures, 0. 91 % and 19. 3 %, define the importance of the disease, which is severe and rather frequent. The date obtained from the survey, especially that related to the geographic distribution of the infection, will undoubtedly help to better evaluate the <b>protozoosis</b> in question...|$|E
40|$|Leishmaniasis is an {{important}} chronic zoonosis caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania spp. The major vectors of this <b>protozoosis</b> are sand flies, and Lutzomyia longipalpis is considered the main species implicated in the transmission of American Visceral Leishmaniasis in Brazil. The presence of the parasite's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in ectoparasites such as ticks and fleas has prompted speculations {{about the existence of}} new vectors in the cycle of leishmaniasis. The aim {{of this paper is to}} report the molecular detection of Leishmania spp. in a horse fly of the species Tabanus importunus which parasitized an oligosymptomatic dog infected with Leishmania spp. Molecular amplification of the protozoan's DNA in the head, thoracic region and abdomen of the tabanid tested positive for Leishmania complex. This is the first report of the presence of DNA from Leishmania spp. in dipterous insects of the species T. importunus...|$|E
40|$|Visceral {{leishmaniasis}} (VL) or kala-azar is, in Portugal, a zoonosis {{with the}} dog as reservoir. A quality control of the technique of micro-ELISA was carried out, using as reference the technique of IFI, {{the most commonly used}} for the diagnosis of this <b>protozoosis,</b> both for human and canine sera. Three different methods were used to estimate the cut-off point: X + 2 sd (average for negative sera plus two standard deviation), P/N and J index. As quality parameteres were used sensitivity, specificity, efficacy and positive predictive value. The cut-off point for human sera was established at 0. 100 A, with 100 % sensitivity, 90. 5 % specificity, 95. 3 % efficacy and 91. 4 % positive predictive value, and for canine sera in 0. 200 A, with 80. 0 % sensitivity, 94. 3 % specificity, 87. 7 % efficacy and 96. 6 % positive predictive value. Reproducibility was not fully satisfactory and two different ways of improving it are proposed: P/N and a correction factor. A statistically significant correlation was observed between micro-ELISA's absorbances and IFI titres regarding human sera, though {{it was not possible to}} do the same for dog sera.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, new aspects of the immunopathology of Chagas ’ disease have been {{described}} in immunosuppressed patients, such as fatal central nervous system lesions related to the reactivation of the parasite. This article is the first description of the genotypic characterization, at the strain level, of Trypanosoma cruzi isolated from a patient with Chagas ‘ disease/AIDS co-infection. The presence of four hypodense lesions was observed in the cranial compute tomographic scan. The diagnosis of AIDS was assessed by the detection of anti-HIV antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot techniques. The CD 4 + lymphocyte counts were maintained under 200 cells/mm 3 dur-ing one year demonstrating {{the severity of the}} state of immunosuppression. Chagas ’ disease was con-firmed by serological and parasitological methods. Trypomastigote forms were visualized in a thick blood smear. The parasite isolated is genotypically similar to the CL strain. The paper reinforces that cerebral Chagas ’ disease can be considered as another potential opportunistic infection in AIDS result-ing from the reactivation of a dormant T. cruzi infection acquired years earlier. Key words: Chagas ’ disease/AIDS co-infection- opportunistic infection- Trypanosoma cruzi- reactivation Recent reports in the literature have provided evidence for the persistence and reactivation of protozoan parasites in humans despite the treat-ment and apparent cure of the disease (Saravia et al. 1990, Guevara et al. 1993, Aebischer 1994). In addition reactivation of some <b>protozoosis</b> in pa-tients infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) indicates that the phenomenum of parasite persistence may be the rule instead of th...|$|E
40|$|Chagas ’ {{disease is}} a <b>protozoosis</b> caused by Trypanosoma cruzi that {{frequently}} shows severe chronic clinical complications of the heart or digestive system. Neurological disorders due to T. cruzi infection are also described in children and immunosuppressed hosts. We have previously reported that IL- 12 p 40 knockout (KO) mice infected with the T. cruzi strain Sylvio X 10 / 4 develop spinal cord neurodegenerative disease. Here, we further characterized neuropathology, parasite burden and inflammatory component associated to the fatal neurological disorder occurring in this mouse model. Forelimb paralysis in infected IL- 12 p 40 KO mice was associated with 60 % (p, 0. 05) decrease in spinal cord neuronal density, glutamate accumulation (153 %, p, 0. 05) and strong demyelization in lesion areas, mostly in those showing heavy protein nitrosylation, all denoting a neurotoxic degenerative profile. Quantification of T. cruzi 18 S rRNA showed that parasite burden was controlled in the spinal cord of WT mice, decreasing from the fifth week after infection, but progressive parasite dissemination was observed in IL- 12 p 40 KO cords concurrent with significant accumulation of the astrocytic marker GFAP (317. 0 %, p, 0. 01) and 8 -fold increase in macrophages/microglia (p, 0. 01), 36. 3 % (p, 0. 01) of which were infected. Similarly, mRNA levels for CD 3, TNF-a, IFN-c, iNOS, IL- 10 and arginase I declined in WT spinal cords about {{the fourth or fifth}} week after infection, but kept increasing in IL- 12 p 40 KO mice. Interestingly, compared to WT tissue, lower mRNA levels for IFN-c were observed in the IL- 12 p 40 KO spinal cords up to the fourth week of infection. Together the data suggest that impairments o...|$|E
