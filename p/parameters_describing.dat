25|$|The models {{described}} {{on this page}} describe {{the evolution of a}} single site within a set of sequences. They are often used for analyzing the evolution of an entire locus by making the simplifying assumption that different sites evolve independently and are identically distributed. This assumption may be justifiable if the sites can be assumed to be evolving neutrally. If the primary effect of natural selection on the evolution of the sequences is to constrain some sites, then models of among-site rate-heterogeneity can be used. This approach allows one to estimate only one matrix of relative rates of substitution, and another set of <b>parameters</b> <b>describing</b> the variance in the total rate of substitution across sites.|$|E

2500|$|The {{shape of}} a Gaussian beam of a given {{wavelength}} λ is governed solely by one parameter, the beam waist [...] w0. This {{is a measure of}} the beam size at the point of its focus (z=0 in the above equations) where the beam width w(z) (as defined above) is the smallest (and likewise where the intensity on-axis (r=0) is the largest). From this parameter the other <b>parameters</b> <b>describing</b> the beam geometry are determined. This includes the Rayleigh range [...] zR and asymptotic beam divergence θ, as detailed below.|$|E
2500|$|Saturation {{decompression}} is {{a physiological}} process of {{transition from a}} steady state of full saturation with inert gas at raised pressure to standard conditions at normal surface atmospheric pressure. [...] It is a long process during which inert gases are eliminated at a very low rate limited by the slowest affected tissues, and a deviation can cause the formation of gas bubbles which can produce decompression sickness. Most operational procedures rely on experimentally derived <b>parameters</b> <b>describing</b> a continuous slow decompression rate, which may depend on depth and gas mixture.|$|E

In so-called renormalizable theories, the system at one scale will generally be seen to consist of self-similar copies of itself when viewed at a smaller scale, with different <b>parameters</b> <b>describing</b> the components of the system. The components, or fundamental variables, may [...] relate to atoms, elementary particles, atomic spins, etc. [...] The parameters of the theory typically describe the interactions of the components. These may be variable couplings which measure the strength of various forces, or mass parameters themselves. The components themselves may appear to be composed of more of the self-same components as one goes to shorter distances.|$|E

5000|$|Renormalization {{specifies}} {{relationships between}} parameters {{in the theory}} when the <b>parameters</b> <b>describing</b> large distance scales differ from the <b>parameters</b> <b>describing</b> small distances. Physically, the pileup of contributions from an infinity of scales involved in a problem may then result in infinities. When describing space and time as a continuum, certain statistical and quantum mechanical constructions are ill-defined. To define them, this continuum limit—the removal of the [...] "construction scaffolding" [...] of lattices at various scales—has to be taken carefully.
