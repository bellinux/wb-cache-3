50|$|The grey <b>pileated</b> <b>finch</b> (Coryphospingus pileatus), {{also known}} as the <b>pileated</b> <b>finch,</b> is a species of bird in the family Thraupidae, where it has {{recently}} been moved to from the Emberizidae. It is found in Brazil, Colombia, French Guiana, and Venezuela in subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, and heavily degraded former forest.|$|E
50|$|The red <b>pileated</b> <b>finch</b> {{is about}} 13.5 cm long. Both {{the male and}} female have a white eye ring. The male has a red crest and a black crown, just as the grey <b>pileated</b> <b>finch</b> does, however its upper parts are dark wine red, with a reddish rump, and the underparts are a drab reddish colour. The red crest and black head are absent in the female and the upper parts are a little more brown than those of the male. The throat of the female is white and the underparts pink.|$|E
50|$|The grey <b>pileated</b> <b>finch</b> forages {{in small}} flocks, {{mostly on the}} ground but also in low undergrowth. Its diet is unknown. Breeding {{takes place in the}} wet season, this being some time between April and November in {{northern}} Venezuaella, and the exact timing depends on the onset of the rains.|$|E
50|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} by the German zoologist Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller in 1776. Molecular analysis has shown that along with C. pileatus, the grey <b>pileated</b> <b>finch,</b> this species belongs in the Thraupidae, the tanager family. The pair form a sister group to a group containing the fulvous-crested tanager, the black-goggled tanager, the shrike tanagers and the grey-headed tanager.|$|E
50|$|The grey <b>pileated</b> <b>finch</b> {{grows to}} {{a length of}} around 13 cm. The male has a white eye ring and {{a small patch of}} scarlet {{on the top of the}} head which can be raised as a crest, and this is {{partially}} concealed by the black plumage on the rest of the crown. The upper parts of the body, wings and tail are grey while the underparts are whitish, grading to grey on the flanks and breast. The female has a similar colouring but lacks the red and black on the head.|$|E
50|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} by the German naturalist Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied in 1821. Molecular analysis has shown that C. pileatus and the red <b>pileated</b> <b>finch</b> (C. cucullatus) belong in the tanager family, Thraupidae, and form a sister group to a group containing the fulvous-crested tanager, the black-goggled tanager, the shrike tanagers and the grey-headed tanager. There are three recognised subspecies; C. p. brevicaudus from northern Colombia and northern Venezuela; C. p. rostratus from the upper Magdalena River Valley, Colombia; and C. p. pileatus from central and eastern Brazil.|$|E
5000|$|The red <b>pileated</b> <b>finch</b> (Coryphospingus cucullatus), {{also known}} as the red-crested finch, is a species of bird in the family Thraupidae. It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, on {{the eastern side of the}} Andes. Its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, and heavily degraded former forest. This is a common species, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as [...] "least concern".|$|E
40|$|The <b>Pileated</b> <b>Finch</b> Coryphospingus pileatus has an {{extensive}} geographic range that encompasses northeast to central, east {{and part of}} southeastern regions in Brazil. In southeastern region, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais states were treated as southern limit of the species distribution. In the present note, we firstly documented the species to São Paulo state, extending to southern its old-believed geographic distribution. We argued several records of C. pileatus in Vale do Paraíba region since 40 years ago. We also hypothesized the future geographic expansion of the species in São Paulo state...|$|E
