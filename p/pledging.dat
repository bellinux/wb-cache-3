40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper {{is an attempt to}} answer the {{following}} questions: firstly, is the <b>pledge</b> an available and favourable form o f securing receivables related to agricultural production due from a debtor who is an agricultural producer, and, secondly, is the <b>pledge</b> an effective measure of obtaining the benefit for the creditor. Three types of <b>pledges</b> have been analysed: an ordinary <b>pledge</b> regulated by articles 306 - 335 of the civil code, a registered <b>pledge</b> and a statutory <b>pledge</b> related to the agricultural lease (article 701 civil code). The paper presents different issues related to the <b>pledge,</b> including the <b>pledge</b> being a subject and object o f the transaction, and the recovery o f the benefit secured by the <b>pledge.</b> The paper ends with a conclusion that from the point o f view o f both: the pledgor and the pledgee, a registered <b>pledge</b> is undoubtedly a much more advantageous and desirable form of securing receivables than an ordinary <b>pledge.</b> Consequently, postulates requesting modifications of some existing regulations concerning registered <b>pledge</b> act seem to be fully justifiable...|$|R

30|$|Inventory <b>pledge</b> {{loans are}} one of the most {{important}} financial instruments in banks, which exceed real estate <b>pledged</b> loans. Compared with international banks, the proportion of inventory <b>pledge</b> loans in China is smaller and develops slowly. Therefore, the rapid development of Chinese modern service industry has been restricted to a particular extent, for example, the logistics and financial industries’ ability to promote growth in real economy has been restricted. During the inventory <b>pledge</b> loan process, the value of <b>pledges</b> changes with time and those with sufficiently high values reduce the credit risk of banks. One of the key risk management problems of banks is to determine a reasonably <b>pledged</b> loan-to-value ratio, a rate of <b>pledge</b> loans, and a <b>pledge</b> value. Therefore, looking for a scientific method to determine a <b>pledged</b> loan-to-value ratio is the first necessity of sound and for the rapid development of the inventory <b>pledge</b> loan business.|$|R

The headquarters of the Regiment of Patricians were located at the Real Colegio de San Carlos, where Saavedra and Juan José Viamonte stopped the column of Denis Pack and Henry Cadogan, composed of British infantry and a cannon. Pack united his remaining forces with Craufurd and resisted inside the Santo Domingo convent. Cadogan took the nearby house of Pedro Medrano, and fired from the rooftop.
