Foil systems developed in 1962 for the WC-130B to collect particulate debris from nuclear tests were installed in the bomb bay and the fuselage beside the cockpit. The wings had four hard points on which to mount the J60 engines and air <b>particulate</b> <b>sampling</b> pods, a gaseous sampling system was housed in the fuselage, and a KA-56 downward-looking panoramic camera mounted in the nose. Two aircraft were additionally modified to carry the Bulova 707-1000 long range camera, which had a 240-inch (608mm) focal length that resulted in its reference designation of Big Item. These high-altitude side-looking cameras, secured by a roll-stabilized mount, could take oblique shots at 5 to 15 degrees below the horizon up to [...] range from the aircraft and provide 30-inch (76cm) high resolution images. The electronics were also updated on the standard F model. The nose of the aircraft was lengthened to house sophisticated navigational equipment along with sensitive detection equipment for gathering SIGINT/ELINT intelligence. The cockpit was provided with a modified Lear MC-1 autopilot. [...] The average cost of each RB-57F conversion approximated $1.5 million.|$|E

40|$|Cement kilns {{can be used}} to co-process fly ash from {{municipal}} solid waste incinerators. However, this might increase emission of organic pollutants like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Knowledge of PCB concentrations and homolog and congener patterns at different stages in this process could be used to assess the possibility of simultaneously controlling emissions of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and "dioxin-like" compounds. To date, emissions from cement kilns co-processing fly ash from {{municipal solid}} waste incinerators have not been analyzed for PCBs. In this study, stack gas and <b>particulate</b> <b>samples</b> from two cement kilns co-processing waste incinerator fly ash were analyzed for PCBs. The average total tri- to deca-chlorinated biphenyl (Sigma 3 - 10 PCB) concentration in the stack gas samples was 10. 15 ng m(- 3). The Sigma 3 - 10 PCB concentration ranges in <b>particulate</b> <b>samples</b> from different stages were 0. 83 - 41. 79 ng g(- 1) for cement kiln 1 and 0. 13 - 1. 69 ng g(- 1) for cement kiln 2. The Sigma 3 - 10 PCB concentrations were much higher in <b>particulate</b> <b>samples</b> from the suspension pre-heater boiler, humidifier tower, and kiln back-end bag filters than in <b>particulate</b> <b>samples</b> from other stages. For these three stages, PCBs contributed to 15 - 18 % of the total PCB, PCDD/F, and polychlorinated naphthalene toxic equivalents in stack gases and particulate matter. The PCB distributions were similar to those found in other studies for PCDD/Fs and polychlorinated naphthalenes, which suggest that {{it may be possible to}} simultaneously control emissions of multiple organic pollutants from cement kilns. Homolog patterns in the <b>particulate</b> <b>samples</b> were dominated by the pentachlorobiphenyls. CB- 105, CB- 118, and CB- 123 were the dominant dioxin-like PCB congeners that formed at the back-end of the cement kiln. A mass balance of PCBs in the cement kilns indicated that the total mass of PCBs in the stack gases and clinker was about half the mass of PCBs in the raw materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This system yields internally consistent results and is capable of frequent and convenient operation. This paper describes an auto exhaust <b>particulate</b> <b>sampling</b> system developed at Esso Research and Engineering Company. This system is capable of frequent and convenient operation, is compatible with constant volume sampling (CVS) of auto exhaust, and collects particulate matter at constant temperature during the 1972 or 1975 Federal Test Procedure. Compatibility is obtained because the particulate sampler requires {{only a small portion}} of the diluted exhaust, the major portion of the sample is available to the CVS system for the measurement of gaseous emissions. Conditions used in the measurement of exhaust particulate conform to those mandated by the Federal Test Procedures for gaseous emissions. Comprehensive investigations of auto exhaust particulate production have been hampered by the absence of collection and sampling systems that would allow meaningful and reproducible particulate emissions data to be obtained. While several laboratory methods are now being used to collect automotive particulate, they cannot be operated conveniently or frequently, and do not allow simultaneous assessment of gaseous emissions, that is, they are not compatible with the CVS system.
