After the films are developed, the "soft " copy of the imageries are gathered with desktop scanners. With digital imagery, several schemes of different automation levels can be developed.

The relation of the IMU to the camera and corrections for the GPS-data of the projection centers have been determined and improved {{by means of a}} small reference block with 5 – 8 photos. For checking purposes the <b>photo</b> <b>coordinates</b> of 252 photos have been measured and the orientations are determined by a combined bundle block adjustment with the GPS-data of the projection centers based on 9 control points. The achieved accuracy of the photo orientations based on IMU and GPS are sufficient for the creation of orthophotos but problems are still existing with y-parallaxes in the models. The y-parallaxes can be reduced by a combined bundle block adjustment without control points or a more expensive inertial measurement system. 1...|$|E

The digital image and a laser point cloud cover part of {{the campus of the}} Federal University of Paraná (UFPR). The algorithm requires the interior and exterior orientation parameters of the image, a laser point cloud (X,Y,Z) and the <b>photo</b> <b>coordinates</b> (x,y) of the building outlines. The algorithm uses the collinearity equations to project the laser point cloud to the image space. The proximity and height selection methods are used to compute the three-dimensional coordinates of the points of the building outlines.

40|$|The {{focus of}} modern photogrammetric {{research}} is to interpret and extract information from digital imagery. A major activity in mapping and database construction is the delineation of linear features (one dimensional features, not necessarily straight lines). Examples of such features are roads, trails, rivers, coast lines, shore lines, area feature perimeters etc. This activity is very labor intensive and proposed machine algorithms are, to date, imperfect and generally usable only in research environments, not in production. Although automated methods of extraction may appear faster, the requisite editing and fixing causes the manual method to remain in effect faster and more accurate. A semi-automated assist is needed to reduce the manual efforts of image analysts. This research proposes a method for semi-automated reconstruction of 3 D photogrammetric linear features, from overlapping aerial photographs, with the option of exploiting redundant DEM data. The following procedures are applied to extract the 3 D linear features from the aerial images semi-automatically. (1) Using the active contour model with iterative variational approach, a sub-pixel accuracy result of 2 D linear feature extraction can be obtained with simultaneous processing of two images. (2) The normalized <b>photo</b> <b>coordinate</b> system makes efficient the corresponding points matching process. (3) Space intersection enables the extracting of the 3 D linear feature. (4) The weighted mean is {{a simple way to}} adjust the extracted data to an existing DEM data set. ...|$|R

"With {{less than}} half of the ground forces and two-thirds of the {{military}} aircraft used 12 years ago in Desert Storm, we have achieved a far more difficult objective. … In Desert Storm, it usually took up to two days for target planners to get a photo of a target, confirm its coordinates, plan the mission, and deliver it to the bomber crew. Now we have near real-time imaging of targets with <b>photos</b> and <b>coordinates</b> transmitted by e-mail to aircraft already in flight.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for dense point cloud matching and aero triangulation {{based on the}} well-known scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) technique. The modern digital cameras can take high resolution aerial images with high end lap between contiguous images in a strip and, if needed, also with high side lap between images on neighboring strips. Therefore, automation on image matching for generation of high density of 3 D object points becomes applicable. A new method is thus developed to perform the processing. Moreover, it can do an aero triangulation and automatic tie point measurement without the need on the input data such as block and strip data for providing image overlap information. In order to increase {{the effectiveness of the}} method for simultaneously processing a large number of aerial images with large image format in a block area, both schemes of Quality Filtering (QF) and Affine Transformation Prediction (AFTP) are proposed for automatic tie point extraction and measurement with a better and satisfactory efficiency. Tests are done by using aerial images taken with the RMK DX camera in Taiwan. Also, high precision ground check points are adopted to evaluate the quality of the results. They show that a high density of 3 D object points are extracted and determined. Furthermore, the automatic tie point selection and measurement is done efficiently even under the circumstance that no priori-knowledge on image overlap is available. Also, ground check points show that the accuracy of <b>photo</b> <b>coordinates</b> is 0. 21 pixels, namely it reaches a subpixel level...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{concerned}} with a comparative study {{and implementation of}} Interior orientation manually and automatically for KFA- 1000. In manually method, firstly, we reproduced the image to its reduced size photographically from the original image to be measurable in a mono comparator from 30 * 30 cm to 23 * 23 cm which proceeds by measuring of <b>photo</b> <b>coordinates</b> of four pieces of KFA- 1000 photo. After computation, it was realized that geometric distortion due to photography is high so the chosen method {{is to make a}} photographic reproduction of the image in suitable pieces, measuring with traditional instruments and pining the pieces together before calculation. In the second method, we scanned the space photo and used digital image processing techniques in which CCF (Cross correlation Function) and BinaryCCF were used to approximate positioning followed by quadratic surface fitting for the purpose of precise fiducial centre determination. In both methods, we applied three types of transformation called Conformal, Affine and 2 D projective to the algorithms. The final results showed that we could achieve sub-pixel accuracy of nearly 10 micrometer for 25 micrometer pixel size image by using 2 D projective transformation which is approximately equal to the accuracy achieved in manual method. With respect to differences between aerial and KFA- 1000 photos, we considered those differences and applied them to the algorithms used in both fields (aerial and space) particularly different background at location of each fiducial mark in KFA- 1000 which made us to resample a suitable template while in aerial photos backgrounds in any photo are similar with good contrast which guarantee the robustness of the algorithms. We also examined the effect of pre-processing techniques on the robustness of algorithm and took into account the results. 1...|$|E

40|$|In photogrammetry, georeference is {{a process}} to {{determine}} ground coordinate based on measurement of <b>photo</b> <b>coordinate.</b> In digital photogrammetry, georeference process {{can be carried out}} using many softwares which are widely available. Georeference is important in photogrammetry. There are many techniques of georeference such as rectification and orthorectification. The accuracy of georeference is very critical because it depends on the capability of the software to produce good accuracy. Today there are many software available for digital photogrammetry but each software may use different algorithm. The aim {{of this study is to}} make comparison of accuracy between three softwares ERDAS IMAGINE 2011, ArcGIS 9. 3 and Global Mapper 13 using different georeference techniques. In this study, four aerial photos, acquired from Department of Survey and Mapping Malaysia and 11 GCPs and 21 CPs were established using rapid static technique of Global Positioning System (GPS) and secondary data were used to perform georeference process. Georeference process was performed using the three softwares and these comparison was made based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Also digitizing is carried out from the rectified and orthorectified photos in the three softwares. The distance measurements was also compared with distance measured on the ground. The RMSE based on point measurement, distance measurement and other factors such as time taken for processing was compared for the three softwares. In this study the results showed that orthorectification technique in ERDAS IMAGINE 2011 software produces better accuracy (± 0. 333 m) compared to rectification technique in ArcGIS 9. 3 (± 0. 879 m) and Global Mapper 13 (± 1. 367 m). As conclusion, Global Mapper 13 and ArcGIS 9. 3 can generate rectified photo with reasonable accuracy but both softwares could not produced block triangulation and orthophoto. However, ArcGIS 9. 3 and Global Mapper 13 softwares are much more user friendly compared to ERDAS IMAGINE 2011 software...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), the {{applications of the}} UAV {{are more and more}} extensively, and one of the important applications is aerial search and rescue. Using the UAV for search and rescue can save cost and avoid the risk of personal injury. Nowadays, the UAV usually use analog 1. 2 GHz, 2. 4 GHz or 5. 8 GHz real-time video transmission system. Because of the limited transmission bandwidth, the maximum resolution is only 640 * 480, which is not enough for aerial search. It is difficult to search and identify the small target by this aerial image with only 640 * 480 resolutions. Because the mobile devices and 3 G base stations are widespread, this research integrated the UAV with a mobile device to perform time lapse photography App. The high resolution (2688 * 1520 pixels) photo can be transmitted to the cloud server via 3 G network. The GCS (ground control station) can receive these high resolution photos from cloud servers. With these high resolution aerial photos, the rescued targets can be found and identified more easily.

A total of 3, 586 benthic photos were taken. A floating GPS setup connected to the swimmer/diver by a line enabled recording of coordinates of transect surveys. Approximation of the coordinates for each benthic photo was based on the photo timestamp and GPS coordinate time stamp, using GPS <b>Photo</b> Link Software. <b>Coordinates</b> of each <b>photo</b> were interpolated by finding the the gps coordinates that were logged at a set time before and after the photo was captured.

40|$|Snow is an {{important}} source of water. However, data is often lacking on the water content (snow water equivalence - SWE), extent and depth of the seasonal snow cover. This paper presents results from a research project that determined the amount of water in a snow pack from snow depth and SWE in an areal manner using remote sensing and photogrammetry. Five field campaigns were undertaken within the Falls Creek Ski Resort, over 18 months, to establish a framework of positional points, collect snow data and acquire aerial imagery. A GPS survey was completed concurrent with the image capture of snow-covered terrain to obtain appropriate validation points of the snow surface and to <b>coordinate</b> <b>photo</b> control. Spectral reflectance measurements, supported by manual sampling of the snow surface, were collected in conjunction with snow surface GPS measurements. Digital photogrammetric methods were used to create digital elevation models (DEMs) of the snow surface and the terrain. The digital aerial photography was acquired with a ground sample distance of 8 cm. Derived DEM values have been consistently higher than GPS elevations (mean differences of 15 cm; standard deviation of 8 cm). Spectral reflectance signatures were used to infer the properties of snow, such as snow grain size. A prominent absorption feature (~ 1030 nm) of the snow reflectance was found to be highly correlated with grain size (R = 0. 71, p < 0. 05) allowing for the estimation of SWE, at least for the snow surface. The potential of this methodology is to allow for the automated estimation of both snow depth and water content at a landscape scale...|$|R
30|$|The {{price of}} a robotic total station is around 80 – 100 times the {{price of a}} camera. More than two cameras can be {{utilized}} to enhance the quality of photogrammetry modeling. Two cameras and two RTS units are initialized by synchronizing their internal clocks. The images are taken once the object falls entirely into the fields of vision of the cameras. Each RTS unit is programmed to automatically track and survey one control point on the moving object being modeled. Via wireless communication networks, time stamped survey data and digital photos are collected in the field for immediate processing and modeling on a laptop. At time point T 0, the <b>photos</b> and the <b>coordinates</b> of two points on a moving object are captured by the two cameras and two RTS units, respectively. Time stamp checking is then performed to assure synchronization quality, which guarantees the data are captured at approximately the same time. In case the time differences between the photos and the control point survey data exceed the preset allowance (e.g. 1 second in the current case), then the photos and the survey data are discarded for ensuing 3 D modeling. Two images taken from different angles are used to build the 3 D model, by pairing and matching five common points in the two photos. The 3 D model coordinate system is set up by selecting an arbitrary origin. The photo-based 3 D model is set on an arbitrary scale. The image and object coordinates are then evaluated based on the collinearity equations. The scale of the model is determined based on the coordinates of the two points fixed by the two robotic total station units. Dimensions of the object can then be obtained at T 0. Next, the above tracking process is repeated on the next event until the tracking process is terminated. The details of the available software for building the photo-based models are discussed in the following section.|$|R
