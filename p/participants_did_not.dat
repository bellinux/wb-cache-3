25|$|The {{optimism}} of la belle époque was destroyed, {{and those who}} had fought in the war were referred to as the Lost Generation. For years afterwards, people mourned the dead, the missing, and the many disabled. Many soldiers returned with severe trauma, suffering from shell shock (also called neurasthenia, a condition related to posttraumatic stress disorder). Many more returned home with few after-effects; however, their silence about the war contributed to the conflict's growing mythological status. Though many <b>participants</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> share in the experiences of combat or spend any significant time at the front, or had positive memories of their service, the images of suffering and trauma became the widely shared perception. Such historians as Dan Todman, Paul Fussell, and Samuel Heyns have all published works since the 1990s arguing that these common perceptions of the war are factually incorrect.|$|E
25|$|Prospective memory cues {{will lead}} to {{spontaneous}} retrieval of an intention when {{at least one of}} four conditions is met: the cue and target action are highly associated with each other, the cue is salient, the other processes performed during the period between cue and action of the prospective memory task direct attention to relevant cue features (e.g., task appropriate processing), or the intended action is simple. Further research has found that although many aspects of prospective memory tasks are automatic, they do involve a small amount of processing. An experiment conducted by Einstein et al. (2005) found that some participants performed slower on a filler task when performing a prospective memory task at the same time. Even though some of the <b>participants</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> engage in active monitoring, they showed nearly the same rate of success on the task, demonstrating the use of multiple processes for prospective memory performance.|$|E
25|$|While {{the link}} between ethnic {{heterogeneity}} and under provision of public goods is generally accepted, there is little consensus around the causal mechanism underlying this relationship. To identify possible causal stories, Humphreys and Habyarimana ran a serious of behavioral games in Kampala, Uganda that involved several local participants completing joint tasks and allocating money amongst them. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, they find that <b>participants</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> favor the welfare of their co-ethnics disproportionately. It was only when anonymity was removed and everyone's ethnicity was known did co-ethnics decide to favor each other. Humphreys and Habyarimana argue that cooperation among co-ethnics is primarily driven by reciprocity norms that tend to be stronger among co-ethnics. The possibility of social sanctions compelled those who would not otherwise cooperate with their co-ethnics to do so. The authors find no {{evidence to suggest that}} co-ethnics display a greater degree of altruism towards each other or have the same preferences. Ethnic cooperation takes place because co-ethnics have common social networks and therefore can monitor each other and can threaten to socially sanction any transgressors.|$|E

25|$|By mid-1991, the Soviet Union {{had reached}} a state of emergency. According to the {{official}} commission (the Soviet Academy of Sciences) appointed by the Supreme Soviet (the higher chamber of the Russian parliament) immediately after the events of August 1991, the Army did not {{play a significant role}} in what some describe as coup d'état of old-guard communists. Commanders sent tanks into the streets of Moscow, but (according to all the commanders and soldiers) only with orders to ensure the safety of the people. It remains unclear why exactly the military forces entered the city, but they clearly did not have the goal of overthrowing Gorbachev (absent on the Black Sea coast at the time) or the government. The coup failed primarily because the <b>participants</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> take any decisive action, and after several days of their inaction the coup simply stopped. Only one confrontation took place between civilians and the tank crews during the coup, which led to the deaths of three civilians. Although the victims became proclaimed heroes, the authorities acquitted the tank crew of all charges. Nobody issued orders to shoot at anyone.|$|E
25|$|To {{distinguish}} {{between these two}} possibilities, Trueswell et al. {{conducted a series of}} experiments similar to those conducted by Yu and Smith except that participants were asked to indicate their choice of the word-referent mapping on each trial, and only a single object name was presented on each trial (with varying numbers of objects). Participants would therefore have been at chance when they are forced to make a choice in their first trial. The results from the subsequent trials indicate that participants were not using a statistical learning mechanism in these experiments, but instead were using a propose-and-verify mechanism, holding only one potential hypothesis in mind at a time. Specifically, if participants had chosen an incorrect word-referent mapping in an initial presentation of a nonsense word (from a display of five possible choices), their likelihood of choosing the correct word-referent mapping in the next trial of that word was still at chance, or 20%. If, though, the participant had chosen the correct word-referent mapping on an initial presentation of a nonsense word, the likelihood of choosing the correct word-referent mapping on the subsequent presentation of that word was approximately 50%. These results were also replicated in a condition where participants were choosing between only two alternatives. These results suggest that <b>participants</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> remember the surrounding context of individual presentations and were therefore not using statistical cues to determine the word-referent mappings. Instead, participants make a hypothesis regarding a word-referent mapping and, on the next presentation of that word, either confirm or reject the hypothesis accordingly.|$|E

2500|$|One of Rickey's {{recruits}} for the Browns, George Sisler, {{became a}} major star in the early 1920s. [...] Outdrawing their tenants substantially, the Browns came within one game of the AL pennant in 1922. [...] However, the tide {{was about to turn}} in the Cardinals' favor. [...] After confidently predicting there would be a World Series in Sportsman's Park by 1926, Browns owner Phil Ball invested in extensive upgrades in its anticipation, including increasing the park's capacity from 18,000 to 30,000. [...] Ball was correct––a World Series was about to be played in Sportsman's Park in 1926—but one of the <b>participants</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> include the Browns.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, Zajonc {{proposed}} the affective primacy hypothesis, which hypothesizes that affective reactions (i.e. liking) can be [...] "elicited with minimal stimulus input". Through mere-exposure experiments, Zajonc sought to {{provide evidence for}} the affective-primacy hypothesis, namely, that affective judgments are made without prior cognitive processes. Zajonc tested this hypothesis by presenting repeated stimuli to participants at suboptimal thresholds such {{that they did not}} show conscious awareness or recognition of the repeated stimuli (when asked whether they had seen the image, responses at chance level), but continued to show affective bias towards the repeatedly exposed stimuli. Zajonc compared results from primes exposed longer which allowed for conscious awareness to stimuli shown briefly such that <b>participants</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> show conscious awareness. He found that the primes shown more briefly and not recognized prompted faster responses for liking as compared to primes shown at conscious levels.|$|E
2500|$|As World War I ended (1918), {{the map of}} Central and Eastern Europe changed drastically. Germany's defeat {{rendered}} Berlin's {{plans for}} the creation of Eastern European puppet states (Mitteleuropa), including one in Poland, obsolete. The Russian Empire collapsed, resulting in the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Russian Civil War of 1917–1922. Several small nations of the region saw a chance for real independence and seized the opportunity to gain it; Soviet Russia viewed its lost territories as rebellious provinces, vital for its security, but did not have the resources to react swiftly. While the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 had not made a definitive ruling in regard to Poland's eastern border, it issued a provisional boundary in December 1919 (the Curzon line) as an attempt to define the territories that had an [...] "indisputably Polish ethnic majority"; the conference <b>participants</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> feel competent to make a certain judgment on the competing claims.|$|E
