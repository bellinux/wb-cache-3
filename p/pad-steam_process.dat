Key words: polyester; dyeability; weight reduction; cotton; sodium hydroxide. Aside from the outstanding features of polyester fabrics such as tensile strength, dimensional stability, washability and abrasion resistance, certain drawbacks such as low water absorbency, pilling, and poor handle have also been reported.

40|$|Successful {{results of}} textile {{materials}} finishing process {{in order to gain}} desired properties to the fabric according to customers' demands mainly depend on properly-carried pre-treatment stages. The present study covers twill weave cotton/polyester fabric's modification in alkaline medium at different temperatures and treatment durations through exhaustion (hot and cold treatment) and <b>pad-steam</b> <b>process.</b> An influence of the reduction agent addition was ascertained. Weight loss, water absorbency, vertical wicking, dye uptake, colour measurements, surface morphology and stress-strain characteristics were determined. Samples and recommendations of optimal alkaline treatment technologies are developed...|$|E

The final dye oxidation using alkaline/hydrogen peroxide bath is reinforced in order to get simultaneous effect in the cleaning of the materials. Several vat dyes of different chemical classes were tested either by exhaustion or pad-batch and <b>pad-steam</b> <b>processes</b> and positive evaluation has been made concerning the yield of dyeing, hue and the brightness of the color. Significant economical and ecological benefits are possible in textile wet processing {{of cellulosic materials}}.

40|$|The present work {{concerns}} {{the study of}} preparation processes when this operation is preceded by a CORONA discharge made on dry raw fabrics. The influence in the whiteness degree, hydrophility, starch removal and uniformity of properties of the cellulosic material after preparation is studied. Combined preparation processes are widely used in order to replace solutions where desizing, alkaline boiling and bleaching are individual operations, being a main interest to find the optimal conditions to achieve alkaline oxidative treatments with an uniform and more intense cleaning action. CORONA discharge is able to strongly modify hydrophility of cotton fabrics in raw stage, which is determinant to increase liquids absorption and uniformity of processed fabrics. Results of long-bath, pad-roll, pad-batch and <b>pad-steam</b> bleaching <b>processes</b> in laboratory conditions are compared using or not wetting agent in the recipes and including CORONA discharge as a preparation operation. The transfer of this technology to industry regarding the implementation in textile plant in a very near future is being worked, supported by results as the present ones...|$|R
40|$|Acid leuco vat dyeings of {{polypropylene}} (PP) fabrics in combinations of a trichromatic series of colorants (red, yellow and blue) plus an orange were performed {{in order to}} determine the compatibility of the component colorants in the developed single stage, batch exhaust dyeing process reported earlier. Cross-section micrographs of dyed fibers revealed the absence of "ring-dyeing". Tensile tests and X-ray crystallinity results confirmed that the developed dyeing process did not significantly alter the tensile strength and modulus of the dyed PP textiles. PP fabrics dyed with simulated, continuous acid vat dyeing <b>processes</b> (<b>pad-steam</b> and pad-dry heat) demonstrated good color yields and levelness with adequate fastness to crocking, washing and dry cleaning...|$|R
40|$|Indigo, {{originally}} {{derived from}} plants, is the dye {{used to produce}} the colour of denim. The textile industry widely employs sodium hydroxide and sodium hydrosulphite to effect indigo dyeing. Commercial efforts are concentrated in reducing waste, effluent load and consumables so as to apply indigo in a sustainable manner. This and the growing global market for denim dyed using natural indigo fosters current academic research. This paper reports the possible use of benign auxiliaries (thiourea dioxide and sodium carbonate) and evaluates the <b>pad-steam</b> <b>process</b> for dyeing with indigo. Ideal dyeing parameters are outlined. The study concludes that indigo dyeing can be achieved using methods that have a reduced {{impact on the environment}} as compared to existing industrial processe...|$|E
40|$|Identification of viable vat dye {{candidates}} of a trichromatic series (compatible red, {{yellow and}} blue colorants) plus an orange {{based on the}} developed single-stage acid leuco vat dyeing process for unmodified polypropylene (PP) flat woven fabrics has been achieved with adequate fastness properties to washing, crocking and dry-cleaning: C. I. Vats Orange 1, Yellow 2 and Red 1 have been certified, whereas Vat Blue 6 is a marginal candidate. Vat Blue 1 has been demonstrated {{to be a viable}} colorant for dyeing of PP fiber as a single colorant. Molecular dynamics simulation and solubility parameter (SP) approaches have been utilized to screen the potential vat dye candidates for generic PP coloration. Experimental K/S results have exhibited good correlation with the predicted mixing energy of acid leuco vat dyes-PP fiber and the calculated dyes' SP's. The low SP/mixing energy acid leuco vat dyes (e. g., C. I. Vat Red 1) have shown better color-yield/fastness properties than the high SP/mixing energy vat dyes (e. g., C. I. Vat Brown 1), exhibiting that increasing difference of SP between the vat dye and the PP fiber, coupled with a higher mixing energy of dye-PP blend, resulted in decreased interactions between the two. For example, C. I. Vat Brown 1 with its high SP and calculated mixing energy with PP gave least color yield than the certified vat dyes, all with lower SP's and mixing energies. Cross-section micrographs of the dyed fibers revealed the absence of "ring-dyeing". Experimentally determined kinetic parameters such as affinity of dyeing and heat of dyeing quantified the presence of interaction between acid leuco vat dyes and PP fiber. Tensile test and X-ray crystallinity results have confirmed that dyeing process did not alter the tensile strength and modulus of the dyed PP textiles significantly. PP Fabrics dyed with simulated continuous dyeing <b>processes</b> (<b>pad-steam</b> and pad-dry heat) demonstrated good color yields and levelness with adequate fastness to crocking, washing and dry cleaning.
