25|$|The {{approach}} of Wiktorowicz and Deber {{is similar to}} Simon and they assert that the rational model tends to deal with “the facts” (data, probabilities) in steps 1 to 3, leaving the issue of assessing values to the final step. According to Wiktorowicz and Deber values are introduced in the final step of the rational model, where the utility of each <b>policy</b> <b>option</b> is assessed.|$|E
25|$|Ribbentrop {{engaged in}} {{diplomacy}} on his own, for example {{when he visited}} France and met Foreign Minister Louis Barthou. During their meeting, Ribbentrop suggested that Barthou meet Hitler at once to sign a Franco-German non-aggression pact. Ribbentrop wanted to buy time to complete German rearmament by removing preventive war as a French <b>policy</b> <b>option.</b> The Barthou-Ribbentrop meeting infuriated Neurath because the two had met without bothering to inform the Foreign Office beforehand.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the start}} of the Troubles in Northern Ireland in 1969, the Sunningdale Agreement was signed by the Irish and British governments in 1973. This {{collapsed}} in May 1974 due to the Ulster Workers' Council strike, and the new British Prime Minister Harold Wilson considered a rapid withdrawal of the British Army and administration from Northern Ireland in 1974–75 as a serious <b>policy</b> <b>option.</b> The relevant cabinet notes remained secret until 2005.|$|E
2500|$|An {{additional}} <b>policy</b> <b>option</b> is {{to continue}} the current trends of government incentive for these types of crops to further evaluate the effects on food prices {{over a longer period}} of time due to the relatively recent onset of the biofuel production industry. [...] Additionally, by virtue of the newness of the industry we can assume that like other startup industries techniques and alternatives will be cultivated quickly if there is sufficient demand for the alternative fuels and biofuels. [...] What could result from the shock to food prices is a very quick move toward some of the non-food biofuels as are listed above amongst the other policy alternatives.|$|E
2500|$|Blair ordered Operation Barras, {{a highly}} {{successful}} SAS/Parachute Regiment strike to rescue hostages from a Sierra Leone rebel group. Historian Andrew Marr {{has argued that the}} success of ground attacks, real and threatened, over air strikes alone was influential on how Blair planned the Iraq War, and that the success of the first three wars Blair fought [...] "played to his sense of himself as a moral war leader". When asked in 2010 if the success of Palliser may have [...] "embolden British politicians" [...] to think of military action as a <b>policy</b> <b>option,</b> General Sir David Richards admitted there [...] "might be something in that".|$|E

[...] The report further noted that Tor [...] "plays only a minor role in the online viewing and distribution of indecent images of children" [...] (due in part to its inherent latency); its usage by the Internet Watch Foundation, the utility of its hidden services for whistleblowers, and its circumvention of the Great Firewall of China were touted.|$|E

This <b>policy</b> <b>option</b> has been used to mitigate the environmental impact of mines in the United States as part of a combined command-and-control and market incentive policy response to environmental protection. One risk attached to this <b>policy</b> <b>option</b> is that if wells become economically unproductive before the period planned for in the trust agreement, the abandoned well could become a liability held by the relevant government authority.|$|E
