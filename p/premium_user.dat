40|$|Abstract—With the multi-fold {{development}} in communication technology, {{there has been}} a rapid growth in consumption of multimedia services using mobile devices. In particular, lots of research has been done to provide multimedia services using a 3 G/WLAN dual mode to mobile device users. All users download contents from content providers through cellular networks and can share their contents with their neighbors. However, we believe that selfish users (or users with limited resources) are not willing to cooperate or share their contents with other users. In this paper, we propose an incentive scheme that gives the benefit of contents sharing to users in a 3 G/WLAN dual mode supporting network. There are two types of users: premium users and ordinary users. Premium users can get high quality contents at the expense of spending their own money and resources of power and bandwidth, while ordinary users receive plain quality contents freely or with paying little amount of money. Our incentive mechanism designs the content provider to offer each <b>premium</b> <b>user</b> a discounted price for downloading high quality contents. Through our approach, each <b>premium</b> <b>user</b> will receive some incentive of a discounted price for receiving high quality contents in proportion to the contribution to the content provider. By doing so, the content provider can increase its total utility too. Our simulation results confirm that our proposed incentive scheme performs well. I...|$|E

We develop an auction framework to bid for allocating the resources based on the utilities and traffic demands. We classify the users into two categories <b>Premium</b> <b>User</b> who has a high priority access and Non <b>premium</b> <b>user</b> having low-priority access. In principle larger the bandwidth more resources WiMAX can support for the user traffic. We apply the concept of Incentive compatibility and use bidding mechanism to maximize the revenue and social welfare of the WiMAX networks. We have considered different cases to achieve this. First, Dependency of networks sharing the resources based {{on the concept of}} reduction to a maximum matching in weighted graphs. Second, Independency of networks with which it will share its resources. This is done by designing a Maxmin fairness algorithm with two different segments in a decision making process: (a) A time dependent function that considers the time when packets wait in queues; (b) A Buffer utility function to consider buffer size in scheduling to prevent overflow and proportional fairness scheme to gives a fair share to users and maximize the social welfare and revenue. Finally we simulate a seven cell approach in Opnet-WiMAX simulator for VoIP, FTP and HTTP traffic with different QoS requirements and show premium users gets prioritized access...|$|E

We performed detailed multi-level analysis of the usage behaviour, infrastructure properties, content characteristics, and user-perceived performance {{of the top five}} services in terms of traffic volume, namely RapidShare, Megaupload, zSHARE, MediaFire, and Hotfile. We carefully devised methods to identify user clickstreams in the HTTP traces, including the identification of free and <b>premium</b> <b>user</b> instances, as well as the identification of content that is split into multiple pieces and downloaded using multiple transactions. Throughout this characterization, we compare and contrast these services with each other as well as with peer-to-peer file sharing and other media sharing services...|$|E
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{is receiving}} a great demand among the budding and old enterprises depending on various Information Technology Services {{in the present}} IT Scenario. Cloud provides various services which mostly depend upon a good decision making process to handle various requests from service consumers. The Cloud users are mostly divided into two premium or priority and basic users. As far as priority users are concerned the resources are reserved well in advance and it shows a strong negotiation between the service providers and end users. If there is lack of resources the provider has to pay some reimbursement to the user as per the agreement called as Service Level Agreement (SLA), whereas the elementary user gets the service but has to make more than the <b>premium</b> <b>user.</b> In this case providers always attempt is made to reduce the repayment and maximize the revenue. Here the goal of our paper is to achieve the service pooling mechanism with an energy-aware allocation method in PAAS model to save the overall expenses. Experimental outcomes in the proposed research also demonstrate how the projected outline is able to handle cost, revenue, penalty and efficient server utilization for cloud services...|$|E
