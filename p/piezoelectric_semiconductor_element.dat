In order to model more advanced and complicated nano-acoustic devices, a macroscopic continuum theory for the generation and propagation of coherent acoustic phonons in <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>semiconductor</b> heterostructures is presented. The macroscopic approach is applicable in the coherent regime, {{and can be}} easily utilized to study coherent acoustic devices based on <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>semiconductor</b> heterosutructures. For each phonon mode, the corresponding coherent acoustic field obeys a loaded string equation. The driven force has contributions from the piezoelectric and deformation potential couplings.

The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental ones. By using the macroscopic theory, we also investigated the crystal-orientation effects on the generation of coherent acoustic phonons in wurtzite multiple quantum wells.

A perturbation procedure was used which resulted in two one-way coupled linear problems of piezoelectricity and the conservation of charge, respectively. The acoustic wave and the accompanying electric field were obtained from the equations of piezoelectricity. The motion of carriers was then determined from the conservation of charge using a trigonometric series. It was found that while the acoustic wave was approximated by a sinusoidal wave, the motion of carriers deviates from a sinusoidal wave qualitatively because of the contributions of higher harmonics arising from the originally nonlinear terms. The wave crests become higher and sharper while the troughs are shallower and wider. This deviation is more pronounced for acoustic waves with larger amplitude...|$|R

40|$|At low {{temperature}} T, the experimental gap of silicon decreases as E_g(T) =E_g(0) -AT^ 4. The main reason is electron-phonon renormalization. The physics behind the T^ 4 -power law {{is more complex}} than has been realized. Renormalization by intraband scattering requires a careful non-adiabatic treatment in order to correctly include acoustic phonons and avoid divergences from piezoacoustic phonon interactions. The result is an unexpected low T term E_g(0) +A' T^p with positive coefficient A', and power p= 4 for non-piezoelectric materials, and power p= 2 for piezoelectric materials. The acoustic phonons in <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>semiconductors</b> generate a <b>piezoelectric</b> field, modifying the electron-phonon coupling. However, at higher T, when thermal acoustic phonons of energy hbar v_s q acquire energies comparable to the electronic intermediate state (higher than the band-edge state by hbar^ 2 q^ 2 / 2 m*), the low q and higher q intraband contributions to T^p rapidly cancel, giving little thermal effect. But there is an additional T-dependence from interband effects of acoustic phonons. This turns out to have power law T^ 4 for both non-piezoelectric and <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>semiconductors.</b> This term can have either sign, but usually reduces the size of gaps as T increases. It arises after cancellation of the T^ 2 terms that appear separately in Debye-Waller and Fan parts of the acoustic phonon interband renormalization. The cancellation occurs because of the acoustic sum rule. Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures. The paper has been improved by refereeing, and typos have been correcte...|$|R
40|$|Piezoelectric {{effect has}} been widely used in {{electromechanical}} sensing, actuation and energy harvesting, which produces polarization charges under mechanical deformation in materials lacking inversion symmetry or with polarization domains. Conventional piezoelectric materials such as PZT and PVDF are electrically insulating and hence not feasible for constructing functional electronics or optoelectronics. The effect of mechanically-induced polarization on electronic and optoelectronic processes of charge carriers in piezoelectric materials has therefore been long overlooked. Semiconductor materials such as ZnO, GaN and CdS with wurtzite or zinc blende structures also possess piezoelectric properties but are not as extensively utilized in piezoelectric sensors and actuators as PZT due to their relatively small piezoelectric coefficients. The coupling of <b>piezoelectric</b> polarization with <b>semiconductor</b> properties in these materials has resulted in both novel fundamental phenomenon and unprecedented device applications, leading to the increasing research interests in the emerging field of piezotronics and piezo-phototronics. The basic of piezotronics and piezo-phototronics {{lies in the fact}} that strain-induced polarization charges at interface can effectively modulate the local band structure and hence the charge carrier transport across local junctions/contacts by exerting substantial influence on the concentration/distribution of free carriers and interfacial electronic charged states in the device.
