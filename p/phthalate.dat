40|$|<b>Phthalates</b> are {{synthesized}} {{in massive}} amounts to produce various plastics {{and have become}} widespread in environments following their release {{as a result of}} extensive usage and production. This has been of an environmental concern because <b>phthalates</b> are hepatotoxic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic by nature. Numerous studies indicated that <b>phthalates</b> can be degraded by bacteria and fungi under aerobic, anoxic, and anaerobic conditions. This paper gives a review on the biodegradation of <b>phthalates</b> and includes the following aspects: (1) the relationship between the chemical structure of <b>phthalates</b> and their biodegradability, (2) the biodegradation of <b>phthalates</b> by pure/mixed cultures, (3) the biodegradation of <b>phthalates</b> under various environments, and (4) the biodegradation pathways of <b>phthalates.</b> © 2008 Springer-Verlag. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|<b>Phthalates</b> are organic {{lipophilic}} compounds {{which are}} mainly used as plasticizer. Human exposure occurs mainly via food ingestion {{and can cause}} negative health effects. <b>Phthalates</b> are not only present in food because of environmental contamination, {{but also as a}} result of migration from contact materials used during production, transport and storage. Specific migration limits for several <b>phthalates</b> have been formulated by the European Commission regarding their use in plastic food contact materials (Directive 2002 / 72 /EC). However, up till now, there is no European regulation regarding residue values of <b>phthalates</b> in food products. In this study, a model will be developed to predict the human dietary exposure to eight <b>phthalates.</b> The model will include - among others - the environmental transfer into primary foods and the migration of <b>phthalates</b> from contact materials into foods. Therefore, input data (concentration data of <b>phthalates</b> in environmental media, contact materials and food products, physicochemical parameters of <b>phthalates,</b> transfer factors, processing factors, etc.) will be linked via formulae or relationships from literature or own measurements. By linking this model to national food consumption survey data, a dietary exposure assessment can be made. The human risks related to the dietary exposure to <b>phthalates</b> can be evaluated by comparing the estimated intakes with tolerable daily intake values for <b>phthalates.</b> Eventually, these risk assessments can be used by the government to draw up specific regulations for residue values of <b>phthalates</b> in certain food products...|$|R

25|$|Pure {{plastics}} {{have low}} toxicity {{due to their}} insolubility in water {{and because they are}} biochemically inert, due to a large molecular weight. Plastic products contain a variety of additives, some of which can be toxic. For example, plasticizers like adipates and phthalates are often added to brittle plastics like polyvinyl chloride to make them pliable enough for use in food packaging, toys, and many other items. Traces of these compounds can leach out of the product. Owing to concerns over the effects of such leachates, the European Union has restricted the use of DEHP (di-2-ethylhexyl <b>phthalate)</b> and other phthalates in some applications, and the United States has limited the use of DEHP, DPB, BBP, DINP, DIDP, and DnOP in children's toys and child care articles with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act. Some compounds leaching from polystyrene food containers have been proposed to interfere with hormone functions and are suspected human carcinogens. Other chemicals of potential concern include alkylphenols.|$|E
25|$|Manufacturers {{point out}} {{that many of the}} {{products}} to be impacted are already making their way through the supply chain. As a result, much inventory that was legal prior to the signing of the law and was manufactured shortly thereafter will probably be on shelves as the deadlines approach. The Natural Resources Defense Council and Public Citizen apparently agree that these products are already in distribution, but believe that manufacturers should still be held liable. The problem is not the lead or <b>phthalate</b> content, as they imply, {{but the fact that the}} products must be tested to make sure they comply. There is also confusion of what products need a GCC and which do not. They have not been tested because the items generally do not contain hazardous materials; CPSC has been slow to define some of the accreditation or testing criteria; some of the low volume, low value items are not economical to test; and lot tracking methods would not allow some of the items to be tracked.|$|E

40|$|International audienceData from {{experiments}} conducted {{almost exclusively}} in the rat have established that some <b>phthalates</b> have deleterious effects on the fetal testis probably due to their antiandrogenic and/or estrogenic effects, but their mechanisms of action remain unknown. A recent study reported that <b>phthalates</b> also have deleterious effects on human fetal testis with germ cell number, but not steroidogenesis altered. Therefore, we used organ culture of fetal testes {{at different stages of}} development to analyze the direct effects of <b>phthalates</b> on both steroidogenesis and gonocyte development and to determine if the effects of MEHP on these functions reported in the rat can be extended to other mammalian species. We defined specific periods of sensitivity of the fetal mouse testis to MEHP for these two functions and showed that the effects of <b>phthalates</b> on steroidogenesis vary with the developmental stage. Conversely, the strong deleterious effects of <b>phthalates</b> on germ cells were constantly present during the active phases of gonocyte development and thus share no relationship with the steroidogenic status. Moreover, all the effects of <b>phthalates</b> were unchanged in testes from mice deficient for estrogen (ERalphaKO or ERbetaKO) or androgen (Tfm) receptors.
