Secondly, he examines the roots of denial, {{both in terms of}} resistance to the evidence and in relation to the actors and agencies motivated to deny climate change. Lastly, he looks at some future scenarios and explains what <b>people</b> <b>should</b> do.|$|E

50|$|At the Convention on Biological Diversity meeting, in Buenos Aires, in 1996, {{emphasis}} {{was put on}} local knowledge. Key players, such as local communities and indigenous <b>peoples,</b> <b>should</b> be recognized by States, and have their sovereignty recognised over the biodiversity of their territories, {{so that they can}} continue protecting it.|$|R
2500|$|As {{a devout}} Christian, {{he also had}} a moral and {{religious}} motive.

5|$|In the Rights of Men, Wollstonecraft {{not only}} endorses republicanism, {{but also a}} social {{contract}} based on sympathy and fellow-feeling. She describes the ideal society in these terms: individuals, supported by cohesive families, connect with others through rational sympathy. Strongly influenced by Price, whom she had met at Newington Green {{just a few years}} earlier, Wollstonecraft asserts that <b>people</b> <b>should</b> strive to imitate God by practicing universal benevolence.|$|E
5|$|Juan José Castelli was {{the main}} speaker for the revolutionaries. He based his speech on two key ideas: the government's lapsed legitimacy—he stated that the Supreme Central Junta was {{dissolved}} and had no rights to designate a Regency—and the principle of retroversion of sovereignty. He spoke after Riega, and replied that the American <b>people</b> <b>should</b> assume control of their government until FerdinandVII could return to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>people</b> <b>should</b> {{like their}} name. Those {{that do not}} should not like their name letters. Hoorens and Nuttin tested this and found that most people rated their name {{relatively}} highly. They also found that subjects who evaluated their own name relatively positively liked their name letters more than subjects who evaluated their own name negatively.|$|E

50|$|The {{revision}} to the Convention 107 {{has meant}} that the integrationist and assimilationist approach are no longer acceptable doctrines for the governments to pursue. Indigenous <b>peoples</b> <b>should</b> hold {{the right to choose}} to integrate or maintain their cultural and political integrity. Articles 8-10 recognize the cultures, traditions, and special circumstances of indigenous tribal peoples.|$|R
50|$|The {{notion of}} rule over foreign lands {{commanded}} widespread acceptance among metropolitan populations, {{even among those}} who associated imperial colonization with oppression and exploitation. For example, the 1904 Congress of the Socialist International concluded that the colonial <b>peoples</b> <b>should</b> be taken in hand by future European socialist governments and led by them into eventual independence.|$|R
5|$|Some obstetricians {{argue that}} not {{offering}} screening for Down syndrome is unethical. As it is a medically reasonable procedure, per informed consent, <b>people</b> <b>should</b> {{at least be}} given information about it. It will then be the woman's choice, based on her personal beliefs, how much or how little screening she wishes. When results from testing become available, it is also considered unethical not to give the results to the person in question.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack for {{the film}} was created and {{released}} before the film's production. Asei Kobayashi, who worked with Obayashi on his television commercials, contributed the piano pieces {{for the film}}'s soundtrack. Kobayashi felt that younger <b>people</b> <b>should</b> contribute to the film's soundtrack and suggested Mickie Yoshino and his band Godiego should contribute songs based on Yoshino's piano pieces.|$|E
5|$|These figures do not {{necessarily}} reflect the war-like violence that is commonly associated with Palm Island. St Michael's Catholic School Principal, Lil Mirtl, has stated that people visiting or living on the Island just need to take sensible precautions such as not walking alone at night, similar to precautions that <b>people</b> <b>should</b> exercise in most places.|$|E
5000|$|Press @ school - {{a debate}} about what journalism means to the new generation, {{about what it means}} to write, to take interviews, to find {{attractive}} topics, to make people read; {{a debate about}} <b>people</b> you <b>should</b> listen to, about the <b>people</b> you <b>should</b> bring close to you; about the borderline between reportage and art.|$|R

While the paths to these objectives may differ, they are inseparable. Economic progress cannot be isolated from the needs for security and expansion of democratic rights.|$|R
50|$|Rather than {{administrating}} large projects itself, the Fund {{believes that}} the primary beneficiaries, the indigenous <b>peoples,</b> <b>should</b> also be the primary administrators of the projects.

5|$|Aleister Crowley {{wrote in}} The Antecedents of Thelema, (1926), an {{incomplete}} work not published in his day, that Rabelais not only set forth {{the law of}} Thelema in a way similar to how Crowley understood it, but predicted and described in code Crowley's life and the holy text that {{he claimed to have}} received, The Book of the Law. Crowley said the work he had received was deeper, showing in more detail the technique <b>people</b> <b>should</b> practice, and revealing scientific mysteries. He said that Rabelais confines himself to portraying an ideal, rather than addressing questions of political economy and similar subjects, which must be solved in order to realize the Law.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, the {{defendant}} Wiens appeared reserved but was noted for extreme statements. He said that Muslims were monsters {{to him and}} asked the court why they were not deported after the 9/11 attacks. He stated that German <b>people</b> <b>should</b> not mingle with foreigners and declared that he would vote for the far right National Democratic Party of Germany. The judge then requested a verbatim record, while the defence counsel tried to mediate. Wiens continued in this fashion, prompting the judge to ask whether he had ever visited a concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|It is {{beneficial}} to give fluids, as this helps reduce dehydration. It {{is no longer}} recommended to administer aspirin, unless advised {{to do so by}} medical personnel, as analgesics may mask symptoms. <b>People</b> <b>should</b> be made comfortable and placed in the supine position (horizontal), or the recovery position if vomiting occurs. In the past, both the Trendelenburg position and the left lateral decubitus position (Durant's maneuver) have been suggested as beneficial where air emboli are suspected, but are no longer recommended for extended periods, owing to concerns regarding cerebral edema.|$|E

5|$|Representatives enthusiastically {{described}} {{a language that}} could work {{in a wide variety}} of environments, from banking and insurance to utilities and inventory control. They agreed unanimously that more <b>people</b> <b>should</b> be able to program and that the new language should not be restricted by the limitations of contemporary technology. A majority agreed that the language should make maximal use of English, be capable of change, be machine-independent and be easy to use, even at the expense of power.|$|E
5|$|Reviewer Jennifer Malkowski {{feels that}} Lana {{is one of}} the most gullible {{characters}} on television. According to Malkowski, Lana's strong feminist stance, and her request that <b>people</b> <b>should</b> stop protecting her and start telling her the truth, are diluted by her willingness to believe whatever pieces of information she gets, even if they are lies. After the series ended, Gough and Millar expressed regret with Lana's characterization throughout the course of the show, which they felt damaged Lana in the audiences' mind. Gough and Millar believed that Lana's behavior toward Clark (for refusing to reveal his secret) made her come across as cold and unsympathetic.|$|E
5|$|The party {{believes}} that artists {{should be less}} dependent on public support, and instead be more dependent on making a living on what they create. The party {{believes that}} regular <b>people</b> <b>should</b> rather decide what good culture is, and demands that artists on public support should offer something the audience wants. It also wants to abolish the annual fee for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and privatise the company. Otherwise, the party wants to protect and secure Norwegian cultural heritage.|$|E
40|$|This Note {{examines}} the problems bearing on admissibility of hypnotically induced or refreshed testimony {{in view of}} the literature discussing the effects of hypnosis on the witness. It focuses on whether the rule on inadmissibility adopted in <b>Peoples</b> <b>should</b> be a per se rule or should be subject to limited exceptions. Finally it considers the effect of the decision on criminal investigations and law enforcement...|$|R
5000|$|Günther in {{his book}} Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes (English: Racial Science of the German People) {{categorized}} Germans as belonging to the Nordic, Mediterranean, Dinaric, Alpine and East Baltic races.Opposed to the Nordics were the Jews, who were [...] "a thing of ferment and disturbance, a wedge driven by Asia into the European structure." [...] Günther argued that the Nordic <b>peoples</b> <b>should</b> unite to secure their dominance.|$|R
5000|$|Joseph Smith opposed interracial marriages. He once {{indicated}} that he felt that black <b>peoples</b> <b>should</b> be [...] "confined by strict law to their own species," [...] which some have said directly opposes Smith's advocacy for all other civil rights. In Nauvoo, it was against the law for black men to marry whites, and Joseph Smith fined two black men for violating his probation of intermarriage between blacks and whites.|$|R
5|$|These events trouble Mac Da Thó greatly, {{such that}} he goes three days without food, drink or sleep. However, his wife devises {{for him a}} plan – that he should give the dog to both parties and let them fight for it. Pleased by this scheme, Mac Da Thó takes each {{delegation}} aside in private, and intimates to both that he had awarded the hound to them after much deliberation. Unknowingly, both parties agreed separately that their <b>people</b> <b>should</b> come {{on the same day}} to a feast in Leinster to claim Ailbe formally.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, when Wollstonecraft {{published}} the Rights of Woman, she extended {{many of the}} arguments she had begun in Rights of Men. If all <b>people</b> <b>should</b> be judged on their merits, she wrote, women {{should be included in}} that group. In both texts, Wollstonecraft emphasizes that the virtue of the British nation is dependent on the virtue of its people. To a great extent, she collapses the distinction between private and public and demands that all educated citizens be offered the chance to participate in the public sphere.|$|E
5|$|While {{the civil}} rights {{movement}} fought against racial segregation, MalcolmX advocated the complete separation of blacks from whites. The Nation of Islam proposed the establishment of a separate country for African Americans in the southern or southwestern United States as an interim measure until African Americans could return to Africa. MalcolmX suggested the United States government owed reparations to black people for the unpaid labor of their ancestors. He also rejected {{the civil rights}} movement's strategy of nonviolence, advocating instead that black <b>people</b> <b>should</b> defend themselves.|$|E
40|$|Rawls’ The Law of Peoples {{does not}} offer a clear principled account {{of the way in}} which liberal and decent <b>peoples</b> <b>should</b> deal with benevolent absolutisms. Within the Rawlsian framework, benevolent absolutisms are a type of society that respects basic human rights and is not {{externally}} aggressive. Rawls rules out the use of coercion to engage with benevolent absolutisms but does not provide an alternative strategy. The article develops one, namely, it argues that liberal and decent <b>peoples</b> <b>should</b> use positive incentives to induce benevolent absolutisms to make their transition to the status of well-ordered peoples. In so doing, it offers a principled way to expand Rawls’ international nonideal theory and, in the process, provides a more nuanced approach to the promotion of political participation in international society. The article draws on the literature on economic statecraft and political theory and constructs an incentive model with seven distinct parameters attached to its definition of incentives. Finally, the article provides a real-world example, of how to concretely implement the incentive mechanism...|$|R
