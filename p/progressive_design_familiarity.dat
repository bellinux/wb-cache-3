40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} assessing {{the quality of a}} <b>progressive</b> <b>design</b> process by measuring the profitability of the product that the process generates. The proposed approach uses separations, a type of problem decomposition, to model <b>progressive</b> <b>design</b> processes. The subproblems in the separations correspond roughly to phases in the <b>progressive</b> <b>design</b> processes. The proposed method simulates the choices of a bounded rational designer for each subproblem using different search algorithms. This paper {{presents a}} simple two-variable problem to help describe the approach and then applies the approach to assess motor design processes. Different types and versions of these search processes are considered to determine if the results are robust to the decisionmaking model. The results indicate that well-designed <b>progressive</b> <b>design</b> processes are the best way to generate profitable product designs. Methods for assessing the quality of engineering design processes can be used to guide improvements to engineering design processes and generate more valuable products. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4001902 �...|$|R

"This concept {{shows the}} {{exciting}} possibilities that {{are open to}} us as we evolve a more <b>progressive</b> <b>design</b> language for the Saab brand", said Jan Åke Jonsson, Saab's Managing Director.

40|$|Many {{techniques}} for synthesizing digital hardware from C-like languages have been proposed, but none {{have emerged as}} successful as Verilog or VHDL for register-transfer-level <b>design.</b> <b>Familiarity</b> {{is the main reason}} C-like languages have been proposed for hardware synthesis. Synthesize hardware from C, proponents claim, and a C programmer can be turned into a hardware designer. Another common motivation is hardware/software codesign: today's systems usually contain a mix of hardware and software, and it is often unclear initially which portions to implement in hardware. Here, using a single language should simplify the migration task. The paper surveys several C-like hardware synthesis languages and looks at two of the fundamental challenges, concurrency and timing control...|$|R
