25|$|The West Indies {{victory in}} the 1976 series {{was the first of}} seven {{consecutive}} wins over England.

For the next two decades, the West Indies cricket would dominate international cricket, never losing a series for fifteen years. The 1976 series has been characterized as a turning point for the West Indies cricket team. The series revealed to the cricketing world a new generation of West Indian cricket superstars like Viv Richards, Clive Lloyd, and Michael Holding.
