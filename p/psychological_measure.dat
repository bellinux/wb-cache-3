50|$|The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) is a {{computer-based}} <b>psychological</b> <b>measure.</b> It {{was heavily}} influenced by the implicit-association test, {{and is one of}} several tasks referred to as indirect measures of implicit attitudes. The IRAP is one of relatively few indirect measures that can includes relational or propositional rather than associative information. The IRAP was conceptualised by Dermot Barnes-Holmes, and originally published in 2006. A meta analysis of clinically-relevant criterion effects suggest that the IRAP has good validity. However, a second meta analysis suggests that it has poor reliability, like many reaction time based measures. Research using the IRAP is often linked to relational frame theory, a functional-analytic theory of language.|$|E
50|$|The Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTTS) is a <b>psychological</b> <b>measure</b> {{designed}} to identify symptoms of disorders relating to attention and impulsivity, such as tic disorder, Tourette’s syndrome, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, {{in children and}} adolescents between ages 6 to 17. The questionnaire is divided into three parts over the span of 17 pages: one section identifies symptoms of motor and phonic tics, severity, and age of onset. Another section concerns OCD symptoms, severity, and age of onset, and the last section concerns environmental effects on symptoms. The YGTTS is completed by the parent and takes approximately 15-20 minutes to complete. The questionnaire has shown good reliability and validity in assessing tic severity in recent studies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Objective: This study {{examined}} racial {{differences in the}} self-report of depressive symptoms by reference to biological states. Methods: The study used {{a convenience sample of}} 20 depressed cancer patients (CES-D � 16) (15 African Americans and 5 Whites). Subjects completed depression assessment on a battery of <b>psychological</b> <b>measures</b> and provided blood and saliva samples. Laboratory tests were performed on biomarkers (serotonin, cortisol and IL- 6). T-test was computed to examine racial differences on biological and <b>psychological</b> <b>measures.</b> Results: Depressed Whites had a significantly higher cortisol level than depressed African Americans, but no significant group difference was found on any self-reported <b>psychological</b> <b>measures</b> of depression. There was a trend that African Americans reported fewer depressive symptoms on <b>psychological</b> <b>measures</b> but exceeded Whites on the domain of somatization; however, such group differences did not approach statistic significance in this small sample. Conclusion: African Americans did not appear to underreport depression in consideration of their biological states, but had a tendency to report more somatic symptoms than Whites; this may be attributable to non-depression diseases or reporting behavior rather than somatic sensitivity. African Americans exhibited more mistrust in the health care system, which could affect the self-report of depression. There is a discord between biological and <b>psychological</b> <b>measures</b> of depression. Biomarkers prove to be useful for evaluating racial difference in the self-report of depression. Implication for Nursing: Nurses should be cautious of somatic complaints when assessing African American cancer patient’s depression. Establishing trust is essential for an accurate assessment of depression in African American cancer patients...|$|R

The paper concludes that while imaginative resistance may provide a <b>psychological</b> <b>measure</b> of what some may find insensitive or tasteless within the realm of pretence, it does not have the resources to be co-opted as a suitable measure of moral wisdom, and therefore cannot be used to guide, morally, what we should or should not be willing to make-believe...|$|E

To date, research on the body image of transsexual patients has mostly covered body dissatisfaction with respect to body perception.

40|$|Introduction: A {{review of}} the {{literature}} shows that standard clinical balance measures do not adequately predict fall risk in community-dwelling older individuals. There is significant evidence demonstrating the interactions of fear, anxiety, and confidence with the control of standing posture. Little is known however about the nature of this relationship under more challenging balance conditions, particularly in the elderly. The primary purpose of this work was to evaluate the relationship between fear of falling, clinical balance measures and fall-risk. Methods: Three studies were conducted evaluating the effects of postural threat (manipulated by support surface elevation) and/or cognitive loading (working memory secondary task) on clinical balance performance and task-specific <b>psychological</b> <b>measures.</b> Predictive and construct validity as well as test-retest reliability was evaluated for measures used to assess fear of falling and related psychological constructs. Results: Postural threat resulted in reduced balance confidence and perceived stability as well as increased state anxiety and fear of falling. These changes were significantly correlated to decrements in performance of clinical balance tasks. Neither standard clinical scales of balance and mobility nor generalized <b>psychological</b> <b>measures,</b> alone or in combination, could predict falls in community-dwelling elderly. However, combined scores on selected challenging clinical balance tasks could significantly predict falls. Furthermore, improved predictive precision resulted from having these tasks performed under combined postural threat and cognitive loading. Finally, the inclusion of task-specific <b>psychological</b> <b>measures</b> resulted in further improvements to predictive precision. <b>Psychological</b> <b>measures</b> demonstrated fair to excellent test-retest reliability in both healthy young and independent-living older individuals. Conclusions: Clinical balance tasks performed under more challenging conditions likely better reflect everyday experiences in which a fall is likely to occur. Incorporating easy-to-administer task-specific psychological evaluations and self-reported health estimates with clinical balance assessments might improve the likelihood of correctly identifying community-dwelling individuals at risk for falls. Improved estimates of fall-risk may lead to a {{reduction in the number of}} falls experienced in this population, thereby reducing the significant burden of fall-related hospitalizations, treatments and rehabilitation on the individual, families and health care system...|$|R
