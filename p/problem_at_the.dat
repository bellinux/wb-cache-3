5|$|Although {{the airport}} is capable of {{handling}} Boeing 767 aircraft, for large numbers of these aircraft, significant investment would be needed. Consequently, the largest aircraft regularly flying to the airport are Boeing 757. The main <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> airport {{is the lack of}} ramp space, with just two parking positions for large aircraft. As a result, El Al operates regular shuttle flights to Ben Gurion International Airport carrying passengers from around the world on 757s and 737s.|$|E
5|$|Bouldering {{competitions}} {{occur in}} both {{indoor and outdoor}} settings. The International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) employs an indoor format that breaks the competition into three rounds: qualifications, semi-finals, and finals. The rounds feature different sets {{of four or five}} boulder problems, and each competitor has a fixed amount of time to attempt each <b>problem.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of each round, competitors are ranked by the number of completed problems, with ties settled {{by the total number of}} attempts taken to solve the problems.|$|E

50|$|The Assistant Secretary-General of {{the junta}} was {{appointed}} Chairman of <b>the</b> Board <b>at</b> Airports of Thailand.

The completed study showed {{that the cost of}} fixing 60 identified <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> airport would be less than 1% of the total airport cost and that the problems could be fixed in four to five years. Dr. Narupol Chaiyut, a member of a committee overseeing service <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> new airport, estimated that 70% of the problems would be fixed in 2007.|$|R

5|$|In 1874 and 1875, Alexander was {{assigned}} to a board examining the problem of keeping the Mississippi River Delta from silting up and becoming an impediment to ship traffic. During {{the course of his}} tenure on the board, he traveled to Europe in order to examine European solutions to the <b>problem.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of 1875, Alexander was asked by the state government of California to examine a proposed irrigation project in the San Joaquin Valley. Busy with other projects, Alexander appointed an associate, William Hammond Hall, to head the project.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton {{led from}} the start, {{preventing}} Fernando Alonso from overtaking at turn one. Alonso ran wide allowing Nick Heidfeld to overtake him and move into second place. Alonso damaged his car {{in the process and}} subsequently ran off the track at turn one a further three times during the race. Jenson Button had a gearbox <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of the race and was unable to select first gear causing him stall on the grid. Christijan Albers started from pit lane. The first accident of the race involved Scott Speed who clipped the rear wing of Wurz' Williams and went into the hairpin with a broken suspension.|$|E

He also said that Ron Artest had apologized to him several months earlier, and wished to work together in some type of community service in Detroit.|$|E

5|$|The wing-to-fuselage mating of {{the first}} A330, the tenth {{airframe}} of the A330 and A340 line, began in mid-February 1992. This aircraft, coated with anti-corrosion paint, was rolled out on 31 March without its General Electric CF6-80E1 engines, which were installed by August. During a static test, the wing failed just below requirement; BAe engineers later resolved the <b>problem.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> 1992 Farnborough Airshow, Northwest deferred delivery of sixteen A330s to 1994, following the cancellation of its A340 orders.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the threat}} from the French Fleet had been neutralised, Cunningham was still aware of {{the threat posed by}} the Italian Fleet to British North African operations, based in Egypt. Although the Royal Navy had won in several actions in the Mediterranean, {{considerably}} upsetting the balance of power, the Italians who were following the theory of a fleet in being had left their ships in harbour. This made the threat of a sortie against the British Fleet a serious <b>problem.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time the harbour at Taranto contained six battleships (five of them battle-worthy), seven heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and eight destroyers. The Admiralty, concerned with the potential for an attack, had drawn up Operation Judgement; a surprise attack on Taranto Harbour. To carry out the attack, the Admiralty sent the new aircraft carrier , commanded by Lumley Lyster, to join HMS Eagle in Cunningham's fleet.|$|E
5|$|By lap ten, Hamilton {{had built}} a three-second lead over his {{teammate}} Rosberg, who was an additional 1.7 seconds ahead of Vettel. While some drivers came into the pit lane for their first regular stop as early as lap 13, the top runners stayed out until lap 37, when Vettel {{was the first to}} come in, followed by Rosberg and Hamilton one lap later respectively. Following the stops, Hamilton led Rosberg by seven seconds. Max Verstappen dropped down the order when a <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rear of the car caused him to be stationary for 31 seconds during his stop on lap 30. Fernando Alonso, who had been running in ninth place, retired from the race with a gearbox failure on lap 43. By lap 45, Hamilton had extended his lead to ten seconds, while Rosberg remained two seconds ahead of Sebastian Vettel.|$|E

5|$|Crime {{continued}} to be a <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Anacostia Station late into {{the first decade of the}} 21st century. Assaults and shootings were more frequent at the station than at any other station in the transit system. There were 32 robberies at the station in 2007. Although Anacostia was one of the 10 Metro stations with the highest crime rate in 2007 (and the only such station on the list inside the District of Columbia), no auto thefts or auto break-ins were reported at the station that year. To help deter crime, Metro installed outdoor security cameras at all 10 high-crime Metrorail stations in July 2008. In September 2008, Metro Transit Police stepped up their visibility and presence at all stations with high student ridership, including Anacostia.|$|E
5|$|Glenn {{chaired the}} Committee on Governmental Affairs from 1987 to 1995. It {{was in this}} role that he {{discovered}} a host of safety and environmental problems with the nation's nuclear weapons facilities. Glenn was {{made aware of the}} <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Fernald Feed Materials Production Center near Cincinnati, and soon found that it was an issue that occurred at several sites around the nation. Glenn requested investigations from the General Accounting Office of Congress and held several hearings on the issue. He spent the remainder of his Senate career acquiring funding to clean up the nuclear waste left at the facilities. He also sat on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees and the Special Committee on Aging.|$|E
5|$|If early {{tetrapods}} {{lived in}} freshwater, {{and if they}} {{lost the ability to}} produce urea and used ammonia only, they would have to evolve it from scratch again later. Not a single species of all the ray-finned fishes living today has been able to do that, so it is not likely the tetrapods would have done so either. Terrestrial animals that can only produce ammonia would have to drink constantly, making a life on land impossible (a few exceptions exist, as some terrestrial woodlice can excrete their nitrogenous waste as ammonia gas). This probably also was a <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start when the tetrapods started to spend time out of water, but eventually the urea system would dominate completely. Because of this it is not likely they emerged in freshwater (unless they first migrated into freshwater habitats and then migrated onto land so shortly after that they still retained the ability to make urea), although some species never left, or returned to, the water could of course have adapted to freshwater lakes and rivers.|$|E

Dick shows up at Mac’s door and tells her that Beaver never cared about her. Veronica finds Piz’s guitar, and they visit the seller. The seller’s {{description}} matches that of other people. Veronica talks to Piz about a suspect, {{but he says that}} it doesn’t match the woman he saw. Keith and the bail-jumper’s car gets stranded. Veronica signs up for the mentoring program in criminology class, and she notices that one of the kids at the concert has a criminal record. Dick gets beaten up when he talks to another man’s girlfriend, but Logan tases the man. Veronica finds the Welcome Wagon girl, the seller’s husband.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{considered}} the largest cemetery in Latin America, {{the most serious}} <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cemetery is limited space. No new grave sites have been established since 1975, and only people who bought a site in perpetuity prior to 1977 can bury members in the cemetery, but the remains must be stacked above those who are already interred. Municipal laws only permit five bodies {{to be buried in}} the same plot, but some tombs may have as many as ten buried one atop another.|$|E

25|$|At {{the front}} of the boiler is the smokebox, into which used exhaust steam is {{injected}} to increase the draught of smoke and combustion gases through the fire tubes in the boiler and out through the chimney.
