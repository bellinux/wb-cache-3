The data obtained is quintessential in establishing the coal rank {{and in the case of}} coal bed methane the gas-in-place estimates. In this study 105 <b>proximate</b> <b>analysis</b> samples, from 7 drilled wells, are taken from the south-eastern Kalahari Basin in Botswana. The pseudo <b>proximate</b> <b>analysis,</b> the method proposed in this thesis, calculates the lab <b>proximate</b> <b>analysis</b> results using the neutron, density and gamma ray wireline logs. The uniqueness of the method lies in the fact that no cut off values are needed for the wireline logs, nor are the results of the lab <b>proximate</b> <b>analysis</b> required for calibration. An in depth study of the relationship between the wireline logs and <b>proximate</b> <b>analysis</b> is conducted using a principle component analysis and the results tested using a combination of statistical techniques to determine the significance of the relationship. It is shown that the density and neutron logs model the proportion of ash and volatile matter in the rock matrix, respectively, with a high degree of accuracy. The multiple regression analysis shows that percentages fixed carbon and moisture components of the rock matrix correlate poorly to the proposed well logs, thus most error lies in the determination of these two components. It is statistically proven that the pseudo <b>proximate</b> <b>analysis</b> results are significantly different to the lab measured <b>proximate</b> <b>analysis.</b> This implies that the proposed pseudo <b>proximate</b> <b>analysis</b> method is unable to accurately determine the components of a coal bearing rock matrix using the density, neutron and gamma ray wireline logs.

40|$|In Malaysia, {{palm oil}} wastes are {{identified}} as the potential biomass for renewable energy sources. Usually the higher heating value (HHV) is essential for energy analysis and can be estimated using bomb calorimeter but this method usually is time consuming with possibilities of experimental errors. Thus many correlations have been established to predict the HHV based on the <b>proximate</b> <b>analysis.</b> However, most of the correlations only {{take into account the}} HHV of raw biomass. No attempts have been made on estimating HHV of torrefied biomass using model correlation. Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} propose new correlation based on <b>proximate</b> <b>analysis</b> which is applicable for raw and torrefied palm oil wastes. The HHV and <b>proximate</b> <b>analysis</b> of raw and torrefied palm oil wastes at different torrefaction temperature ranges from 240 to 330 °C are measured experimentally for model correlation. In addition the HHV and <b>proximate</b> <b>analysis</b> of raw and torrefied palm oil wastes from published literature are included in order to enhance the reliability of model correlation. Based on the model correlation, low average absolute error (AAE) of 5. 37 % and low average bias error (ABE) of - 1. 00 % are obtained indicating the estimated model correlation is suitable and reliable to estimate the HHV of raw and torrefied palm oil wastes from <b>proximate</b> <b>analysis...</b>|$|E

40|$|The <b>proximate</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{the most}} common form of coal {{evaluation}} and it reveals the quality of a coal sample. It examines four factors including the moisture, ash, volatile matter (VM), and fixed carbon (FC) within the coal sample. Every factor is determined through a distinct experimental procedure under ASTM specified conditions. These determinations are time consuming and require a significant amount of laboratory equipment. The calorific value is one of the most important properties of a solid fuel and its experimental determination requires special instrumentation and highly trained analyst to operate it. This paper develops mathematical and ANFIS models for estimation of two factors of <b>proximate</b> <b>analysis</b> based on the other two factors. Furthermore, the estimation of calorific value of coal samples based on <b>proximate</b> <b>analysis</b> factors is performed using multivariable regression, the Minitab 16 software package, and the ANFIS, Matlab software package.

40|$|Under current Supreme Court case law, a {{plaintiff}} {{does not have}} Article III standing to sue in federal court unless that plaintiff can demonstrate “causation. ” The term “causation” is ubiquitous within the law. Because of {{the frequency with which}} the term appears in various legal contexts, however, the conceptual analysis associated with that term can vary. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has never clearly established the conceptual analysis necessary for making the causation determination within standing law. Consequently, there is confusion on this question. This Article addresses that confusion by relying on causation terms and concepts fully developed within tort law. The term “causation” is associated with the “proximate cause” and “cause in fact” analyses within a standard negligence claim. In the early Supreme Court cases in which the causation prong of standing was introduced, the Court most often used cause in fact language in determining the causation prong of standing. Upon a close inspection of these early Supreme Court cases, however, {{it seems likely that the}} Court actually intended a <b>proximate</b> cause <b>analysis.</b> Moreover, a <b>proximate</b> cause <b>analysis</b> is more consistent with the “gatekeeping” function normally attributed to the standing requirement. This Article argues that the causation prong of standing should be interpreted as being analogous to the proximate cause doctrine within negligence law. This interpretation would more closely align with the intuitions that originally prompted the development of the causation prong of standing. Moreover, a proximate cause interpretation would facilitate the development of a clear procedure for determining standing at the outset of litigation, thus fulfilling the “gatekeeping” function attributed to standing...|$|R
