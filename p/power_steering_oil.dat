Prolonged high under-hood temperatures may cause the power steering hose to deteriorate prematurely and may cause the hose to crack and leak <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>oil.</b> Oil leaking onto a hot catalytic converter will generate smoke and possibly lead to an under-hood fire. Affected vehicles were to be inspected and repaired, as applicable, at no charge. Reportedly, this recall extended to both 2005-2008 Acura RL and 2004-2008 Acura TL models.|$|E

40|$|Edible oils plays a very {{important}} role in human beings in third generation, because lots of people suffer from fat, asthama, blood pressure, etc due to consuming a lower quality of oils in their daily life, so I decided to design and develop an instrument which can easily display the quality of oil on the basis of some parameters. The one of the main reason of lowering down the quality of oil is carbon due to heating, so if we can measure the amount or percentage of carbon in the oil we can prevent so many bad things to happen. So I have designed a low cost microcontroller based instrument which measures the amount of carbon in oil by measuring capacitance of oil {{with the help of a}} capacitive sensor[1]. This is not only the one application of this instrument, this instrument also plays an important role in automobile industries, as it can be used for checking the condition of mobile oils in vehicles, in today’s busy life people don’t have time to check engine oil, <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>oil</b> even they don’t have time to maintain their own veh icle, so I thought if I put this type of instrument as an indicator at the meter section of cars and motorbikes people can read out the condition of engine oil and before the oil goes into the worst condition they can change their oils. This instrument can also be used by various food departments etc where they can check various samples of different companies and decides the price of oils and can check the quality whether the quality of oil is in safe range or not...|$|E

50|$|A {{hydraulic}} <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> (HPS) uses {{hydraulic pressure}} supplied by an engine-driven pump {{to assist the}} motion of turning the <b>steering</b> wheel. Electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> (EPS) is more efficient than hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> since the electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> motor only needs to provide assistance when the steering wheel is turned, whereas the hydraulic pump must run constantly. In EPS, the amount of assistance is easily tunable to the vehicle type, road speed, and even driver preference. An added benefit is the elimination of environmental hazard posed by leakage and disposal of hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> fluid. In addition, electrical assistance is not lost when the engine fails or stalls, whereas hydraulic assistance stops working if the engine stops, making the steering doubly heavy as the driver must now turn not only the very heavy steering—without any help—but also the power-assistance system itself.|$|R
