5|$|While Sawyer {{was serving}} overseas, the reform {{coalition}} swept the Democrats into power in Philadelphia {{for the first}} time in 67 years. When he returned to Philadelphia, Clark asked him to run for an at-large seat on City Council in 1955. By the rules of the limited voting system for the at-large seats, each political party could nominate five candidates and voters could only choose five. The result was that the majority party could take only five of the seven seats, leaving two for the minority party. Sawyer was elected to one such seat and served a single four-year term. In that position, he sponsored legislation to establish the city's One Percent for Fine Arts program, which required one <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of construction projects in Center City to be spent on public art. He also worked for the creation of a Police Review Board. City Council did not pass that bill, but Mayor James Tate later created the board through an executive order.|$|E
25|$|SMWC {{provides}} {{scholarships for}} up to 50 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of tuition and fees that exceed the standard education benefit.

25|$|The {{project is}} funded {{and run by}} seven member entities—the European Union, India, Japan, China, Russia, South Korea, and the United States. The EU, as host party for the ITER complex, is {{contributing}} about 45 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost,</b> with the other six parties contributing approximately 9 percent each.|$|E
50|$|It also {{prohibited}} the Government from initiating any feasibility study for a water resources project until non-Federal interests agree to contribute 50 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> during <b>the</b> period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study but exempted from such prohibition any study designed {{for purposes of}} navigational improvements. It also {{prohibited the}} Government from initiating any planning or engineering authorized by this Act until non-Federal interests agree to contribute 50 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> during <b>the</b> period <b>of</b> planning and engineering. Finally, WRDA 1986 provided for determining the interest rate when a non-Federal interest elects to repay an amount under this Act {{over a period of}} time.|$|R
50|$|Following Typhoon Nari, Jeju Island was {{declared}} a national disaster area by the South Korean government. Residents who lost 30 <b>percent</b> or more <b>of</b> their property {{were entitled to}} a nine-month extension to their tax deadlines.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{economic}} <b>costs</b> {{associated with}} alcohol abuse in New Mexico in 2007 amounted {{to an estimated}} $ 2. 8 billion or more than $ 1, 400 for {{every person in the}} state. This estimate represents an 11 % increase in both total and per capita <b>costs</b> over <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> reported previously for 2006. 1 This increase was <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> an 11 % increase in New Mexico's alcohol-related death rate, from 48. 8 deaths per 100, 000 in 2006 to 54. 2 deaths per 100, 000 in 2007. <b>The</b> distribution <b>of</b> these <b>costs</b> by category is shown in the table below. <b>The</b> majority, 72 <b>percent,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> associated with alcohol abuse were <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> lost productivity ($ 1. 9 billion). Most of these lost productivity costs were due to alcohol-related illnesses and premature deaths. Healthcare expenditures for <b>the</b> medical consequences <b>of</b> alcohol use and for the prevention and treatment of alcohol use disorders accounted for 16 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> ($ 462 million); and 12 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> ($ 323 million) resulted from other impacts on society, including property and administrative costs associated with alcohol-related fires and motor vehicle crashes; social welfare administration costs; and various criminal justice system costs associated with alcohol-related crime. The methods used to generate this estimate were described in the 2006 report referenced below. If you have any further questions regarding this cost estimate contact Jim Roeber <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Epidemiolog...|$|R
25|$|The 1983 {{legislation}} also imposed {{the requirements}} {{that the level}} of fares must be sufficient, in the aggregate, to equal 50 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of providing transportation, and that the RTA Board inform each Service Board, as part of the budget process, of its required recovery ratio for the next fiscal year.|$|E
25|$|ONEA has {{substantially}} {{invested in}} sanitation by helping households to build such shower and washing facilities connected to soakaway pits, {{as well as}} improved latrines. ONEA subsidizes these facilities {{with the support of}} international donors and with the cash generated by the sanitation surcharge on water bills. The grants provided by ONEA amount on average to 40 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of facilities, thus making them affordable to households. Sewerage plays a marginal role in Burkina Faso. There are only 235 connections to sewers in the entire country, all in Ouagadougou.|$|E
25|$|Several {{members of}} the United States Congress have called for {{mandatory}} production of flexible fuel vehicles. Also the E85 and Biodiesel Access Act proposed to modify current IRS limits on the tax credit which today only allows for the amount a dual fuel dispenser exceeds {{the cost of a}} conventional dispenser. The E85 and Biodiesel Access Act would increase the credit from 30 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of clean fueling property to 50 percent and increase the maximum credit to $100,000. This law would also extend the existing credit which is scheduled to expire at the end of 2009.|$|E
50|$|In 1975, the Basin {{community}} formed {{water and}} sewer districts and, using federal grants to cover about 60 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs,</b> built a water delivery, sewage, and waste-handling system. By 1990, Interstate 15 had replaced <b>the</b> entire length <b>of</b> U.S. Route 91 in the state. <b>The</b> centerline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Interstate followed <b>the</b> track <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Great Northern Railway through town.|$|R

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1994 the President and Board of Trustees of Middlebury College adopted a “One Percent for Art” policy. This {{decision}} set aside one <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of any renovation or new construction at the College for the purchase, installation, maintenance, and interpretation {{of works of art}} publicly displayed on campus. There are 19 works in Middlebury's campus public art collection, including Frisbee, George Rickey's Two Open Rectangles, Excentric, Variation VI, Tony Smith's Smog, and a version of Robert Indiana's Love series. The collection also includes works by Dan Graham, Scott Burton, Jules Olitski, Joseph Bueys, Matt Mullican, Jenny Holzer, Christian Petersen, Buky Schwartz, George Rickey, Clement Meadmore, and Jonathan Borofsky.|$|E
25|$|Tibesti has tourism potential, {{with its}} primary attractions being the palm groves, rock and parietal art, canyons, basalt spires, volcanoes and hot springs. However, the Zouar {{airfield}} cannot accommodate aircraft {{with more than}} a 20-seat capacity. This pushes the cost of air tickets from N'djamena up to 60 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> to fly from N'djamena to major European cities. Furthermore, tourist accommodations are virtually absent. As a result, the majority of tourists, most of whom are German, enter Libya, purchase all-terrain vehicles or caravans on the spot, and then cross the border into Chad. Thus, the economic benefits to Chad amount to only around 100 euros per tourist. The presence of numerous landmines is a danger to tourists, and thus hiking is generally limited to {{the southern end of the}} range. The ascent up Emi Koussi, around the Era Kohor, and then on to Yi Yerra hot springs generally takes about three days. The volcano has been climbed by 100 westerners since 1957.|$|E
500|$|Photovoltaic systems use no fuel, and modules {{typically}} last 25 to 40 years. Thus, {{capital costs}} make {{up most of}} the cost of solar power. Operations and maintenance costs for new utility-scale solar plants in the US are estimated to be 9 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of photovoltaic electricity, and 17 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of solar thermal electricity. Governments have created various financial incentives to encourage the use of solar power, such as feed-in tariff programs. [...] Also, Renewable portfolio standards impose a government mandate [...] that utilities generate or acquire a certain percentage of renewable power regardless of increased energy procurement costs. In most states, RPS goals can be achieved by any combination of solar, wind, biomass, landfill gas, ocean, geothermal, municipal solid waste, hydroelectric, hydrogen, or fuel cell technologies.|$|E

500|$|On April 22, President Bill Clinton {{flew over}} Grand Forks {{surveying}} the flooded cities. He then visited {{the thousands of}} refugees at the nearby Grand Forks Air Force Base and commented on the community's spirit, stating [...] "Water cannot wash that away. Fire cannot burn that away. And blizzards cannot freeze that away." [...] President Clinton also declared that the Federal Emergency Management Agency would compensate 100 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of emergency work, instead of the normal 75 percent. He also requested that Congress approve $488 million for various counties within North Dakota, Minnesota, and South Dakota for short and long-term reconstruction efforts.|$|E
500|$|What is now I-370 was {{originally}} proposed {{as part of}} the Intercounty Connector in the late 1970s. The I-370 freeway opened on December 17, 1988, connecting I-270 to the Shady Grove Metro station. After {{three and a half years}} of construction, the freeway was four lanes wide and [...] long. Its construction cost $169 million, with federal funds paying for ninety <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost.</b> The state of Maryland's portion of the cost was funded with a portion of the proceeds of a nickel-per-gallon gas tax increase in 1987. Prior to its opening, driving from I-270 to the Shady Grove Metro station involved exiting at Shady Grove Road and passing six traffic lights to arrive at the station. Upon its opening, the remainder of the Intercounty Connector was planned but not yet built. At the time, it was the third shortest interstate, after I-878 in New York and I-395 in Baltimore.|$|E
500|$|The Toronto 2015 Organizing Committee {{and three}} jurisdictions of {{government}} were {{to spend about}} [...] million in upgrading and building new venues in the region. An additional [...] million was to be spent in operating expenses such as venue management and marketing. The Canadian federal government was expected to provide [...] million in funding for the games, while the City of Toronto's contribution was to be [...] million. Other municipalities which are hosting sporting events were to cover [...] million of the costs. All remaining costs were covered by the Government of Ontario.

[...] The area's designation as a historic district has been used to prevent the McDonald's corporation from moving into the area, the relocation of a homeless shelter to the area, and the construction of moderate-income rowhouses. In 1992, the city began replacing concrete sidewalks in the Anacostia Historic District with red brick to restore the sidewalks to their original condition. In 2002, the city adopted the Historic Housing Tax Credit Act of 2002, which allowed homeowners in the historic district to claim a tax credit of 50 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of renovating their home (up to a limit of $25,000 over five years).
