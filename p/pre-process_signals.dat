A crucial step for efficient BCI operation is brain signal processing methods. Most BCI systems for humans use scalp recorded electroencephalographic activity, whereas Electrocorticography (ECoG) is a minimally-invasive alternative to electroencephalogram (EEG), providing higher and superior signal characteristics allowing rapid user training and faster communication. Its efficiency is based on brain signal processing methods that classify brain signal patterns in different tasks accurately. Artifacts in raw brain signal make it necessary to <b>pre-process</b> <b>signals</b> for feature extraction.

OFDM is being widely adopted in several wireless standards due to its spectrum efficiency and other advantages. Recent integration with multiple-antenna techniques promises a significant boost in performance of OFDM.

40|$|Abstract: One of the {{scientific}} tests performed to diagnose Heart Diseases is through Electrocardiogram signals, which shows an electrical activity of the heart {{in terms of the}} waves. To diagnose Heart Diseases based ON ECG signal, a medical doctor obtained the features like amplitude of the waves QRS-complex, P-wave and T-wave and the time interval between the waves called R-R interval, P-R interval, S-T interval and Q-T interval. Since an ECG signals may be of different lengths and as being a non-stationary signal, the irregularity may not be periodic instead of showing up at any interval of the signal, a physician has to analyse the signals completely which is a time consuming process. Therefore, in the present study, an algorithm is developed to pre-process and to automatically extract the features from ECG signal based on Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and De-noising factor. The developed algorithm initially performs pre-processing of a signal in order to remove Baseline Drift (De-trending) and to remove noise (De-noising) from the signal and then it uses the <b>pre-processed</b> <b>signal</b> for feature extraction from the ECG signal automatically.

40|$|The paper aims at {{detecting}} on-line cognitive {{failures in}} driving by decoding the EEG signals acquired during visual alertness, motor-planning and motor-execution {{phases of the}} driver. Visual alertness of the driver is detected by classifying the <b>pre-processed</b> EEG <b>signals</b> obtained from his pre-frontal and frontal lobes into two classes: alert and non-alert. Motor-planning performed by the driver using the <b>pre-processed</b> parietal <b>signals</b> is classified into four classes: braking, acceleration, steering control and no operation. Cognitive failures in motor-planning are determined by comparing the classified motor-planning class of the driver with the ground truth class obtained from the co-pilot through a hand-held rotary switch. Lastly, failure in motor execution is detected, when the time-delay between the onset of motor imagination and the EMG response exceeds a predefined duration. The {{most important aspect of}} the present research lies in cognitive failure classification during the planning phase. The complexity in subjective plan classification arises due to possible overlap of signal features involved in braking, acceleration and steering control. A specialized interval/general type- 2 fuzzy set induced neural classifier is employed to eliminate the uncertainty in classification of motor-planning. Experiments undertaken reveal that the proposed neuro-fuzzy classifier outperforms traditional techniques in presence of external disturbances to the driver. Decoding of visual alertness and motor-execution are performed with kernelized support vector machine classifiers.
