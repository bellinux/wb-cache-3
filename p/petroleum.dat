40|$|A {{procedure}} for quantitative analysis of skin carcinogenesis data, {{for the purpose}} of establishing carcinogenic potency, has been applied to observations obtained from C 3 H mice exposed continuously to synthetic and natural <b>petroleums.</b> The importance of total polynuclear aromatic (PNA) content to the skin carcinogenic activity of the crude materials was also examined. Of three synthetic <b>petroleums</b> evaluated, all were shown capable of inducing skin neoplasms within a two-year exposure period. Under comparable exposure conditions a composite sample of five natural <b>petroleums</b> was noncarcinogenic. Comparison of the distributions of times to initial skin neoplasm versus dose rate, for groups exposed to synthetic fossil liquids and the reference skin carcinogen, benzo(a) pyrene, provided estimates of relative carcinotenic potency for the synthetic <b>petroleums</b> ranging from 1 / 500 to 1 / 1400 the potency of benzo(a) pyrene. The carcinogenic activity of a chemically isolated PNA fraction versus the crude from which it was derived suggested that this fraction was responsible for the carcinogenic activity of these synthetic <b>petroleums</b> in mouse skin...|$|R

In 1989, TETCO was taken over by the Panhandle Eastern Corporation, and in 1997 this company was merged with Duke Power, to form the Duke Energy Corporation; in 2007, the oil pipelines were spun off from Duke Energy, to form part of Spectra Energy Partners.|$|E

5|$|The Big Inch and Little Big Inch, collectively {{known as}} the Inch {{pipelines}}, are <b>petroleum</b> pipelines extending from Texas to New Jersey, built between 1942 and 1944 as emergency war measures in the U.S. Before World War II, <b>petroleum</b> products were transported from the oil fields of Texas to the north-eastern states by sea by oil tankers. After the United States entered the war on 1 January 1942, this vital link was attacked by German submarines in the Operation Paukenschlag, threatening both the oil supplies to the north-east and its onward transshipment to Great Britain. The Secretary of the Interior, Harold Ickes, championed the pipeline project {{as a way of}} transporting <b>petroleum</b> by the more-secure, interior route.|$|E
