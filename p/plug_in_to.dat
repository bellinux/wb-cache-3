40|$|I {{have worked}} on my {{examination}} project at Turnhill AB [1], Skellefteå. The purpose {{of the project was}} to document the network, to tidy up among the network cables in the network room, and to come up with two solutions for a VPN-solution. In the documenting phase I first encountered problems when trying to figure out which devices were <b>plugged</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> which ports of the firewall and switch. However, this was solved with time and patience. To simplify this process for future changes, I made two documents, one of which explains what devices are <b>plugged</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> which ports on the firewall/switch, and the other explains where the cables <b>plugged</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> the patch panel are <b>plugged</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> the firewall/switch. With future updates of these lists when changes are made, there should not be any trouble keeping the network neat and tidy. In my research for suitable VPN-solutions I stumbled upon the freeware Logmein Hamachi, which satisfied the needs by far. In consultation with my supervisor we chose to implement it, which did not cause any trouble. For this solution to be available when I am not longer accessible, I made an installation guide so that the employees of the company can use it on their own. When I was to tidy up among the cables I replaced some of the poor cables and shortened some with the help of cable ties, and I also used those to fix the cables in a neat fashion. My conclusions while working on this project were that if Turnhill were to expand their network they will need more switches. Also, if expansion is relevant there should be a reorganization of the cables in the firewall/switch ports, since the network does not look organized at this moment.

40|$|RedAlert is a {{complete}} application monitoring system which consists of a stateful server daemon and extensible Perl client API. Almost any IP-protocol service {{is a candidate for}} RedAlert monitoring: the clients determine what error condition they have discovered, convert that information into a standard message format, and transmit the Alert to the server. RedAlert therefore will easily <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> existing script-based monitoring environments, providing greatly increased functionality for a minimal investment in configuration time. This functionality includes volume tracking, interval sampling, threshold-based notifications, and reporting mechanisms which include pager, electronic mail, and SNMP traps.

40|$|This essay {{considers}} the curious way Laurence Sterne communicates with and reflects on his literary predecessors, most often Alexander Pope, by writing love letters to women. Focusing primarily on his correspondence with Elizabeth Draper, Barnes contends that, even as Sterne {{looks back to}} Pope to guarantee himself a place in literary history, he looks forward to women like Draper to ensure his name will survive.   Thus, erotic correspondence becomes an important way of ensuring Sterne’s literary estate, or as he terms it, his “futurity. ” “Orna Me”—a phrase that means, roughly, “ornament me” or “set me off,” and that Sterne got from Pope and Swift, who got it from Cicero—allows Sterne to <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> a literary tradition that privileges collaboration: append something of yours to something of mine. It is this idea of letter-writing as correspondence, a collaborative process between friends or lovers, that unites Sterne to his female correspondent and to literary tradition all at once...|$|E

With power alerts and blackouts a recent reality in California, {{it is easy to}} conclude that the energy requirements of grid-connected electric vehicles will make the energy crisis worse. Actually, quite the opposite may be true. With a bi-directional grid power interface, virtually any vehicle that can plug into the grid can potentially provide beneficial support to the grid. Battery electric vehicles can support the grid exceptionally well by providing any of a number of functions known collectively as ancillary services. These services are vital to the smooth and efficient operation of the power grid. A hybrid vehicle can provide ancillary services, and can also generate power. Fuel cells are already being commercialized for small stationary power sources, so a vehiclemounted fuel cell could also serve as a vehicle-to-grid power source. Sharing power assets between transportation and power generation functions can create a compelling new economics for electrically-propelled vehicles...|$|E

Knowledge about the philinid snails of the region has largely been based on shells, but shells can be insufficient to discriminate between species. In this paper, we review the diversity and revise the systematics of the West African species of Philinidae sensu lato based on a comprehensive literature review and the study of shells, anatomy and DNA sequence data of novel specimens obtained by the R/V Dr Fridtjof Nansen (2005 – 2012) between Morocco and Angola. We use scanning electron microscopy together with a cytochrome c oxidase subunit I molecular phylogeny and molecular species delimitation methods (ABGD and SDP Geneious <b>Plug</b> <b>In)</b> <b>to</b> define species. Twenty species (19 formally named) were found to occur in the region, including four new species we describe here: Laona nanseni sp. nov., Philine cerebralis sp. nov., Philine schrammi sp. nov. and Spiniphiline caboverdensis sp. nov. We identified a complex of four cryptic species under the name P. quadripartita (P. guineensis, P. quadripartita, Philine schrammi sp. nov., Philine sp.). A biogeographical break is observed around Cape Verde and the Sahelian upwelling system coinciding with the West African Transition Province; eight species have their northern geographical limit or are restricted to this Province, while ten species have their southern limit here or just further north. Only one species seems to span across this biogeographical breaking point (P. scabra), but we speculate that this might result from taxonomic misidentifications...|$|E
40|$|Several {{numerical}} landscape evolution models (LEMs) {{have been}} developed to date, and many are available as open source codes. Most are written in efficient programming languages such as Fortran or C, but often require additional code efforts to <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> more user-friendly data analysis and/or visualization tools to ease interpretation and scientific insight. In this paper, we present an effort to port a common core of accepted physical principles governing landscape evolution directly into a high-level language and data analysis environment such as Matlab. SIGNUM (acronym for Simple Integrated Geomorphological Numerical Model) is an independent and self-contained Matlab, TIN-based landscape evolution model, built to simulate topography development at various space and time scales. SIGNUM is presently capable of simulating hillslope processes such as linear and nonlinear diffusion, fluvial incision into bedrock, spatially varying surface uplift which can be used to simulate changes in base level, thrust and faulting, as well as effects of climate changes. Although based on accepted and well-known processes and algorithms in its present version, it is built with a modular structure, which allows to easily modify and upgrade the simulated physical processes to suite virtually any user needs. The code is conceived as an open-source project, and is thus an ideal tool for both research and didactic purposes, thanks to the high-level nature of the Matlab environment and its popularity among the scientific community. In this paper the simulation code is presented together with some simple examples of surface evolution, and guidelines for development of new modules and algorithms are proposed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
