Although it was never adopted by the British Parliament, it was an important precursor to the United States Constitution.

500|$|On October 4, the NBA {{canceled}} {{the remainder of}} the preseason. Stern said the league would lose $200 million by canceling the preseason, and warned that {{the first two weeks of}} the season would be in jeopardy if no deal is reached by October 10. The players proposed that they receive 53% of BRI, while the owners countered with 47%. The two sides then discussed a 50–50 split of BRI, with the owners offering the players 49% of BRI with incentives that would raise the value to 51%. The players countered by asking for 51%, which would increase to 53 percent using those same incentives. It was rejected by the owners. Attempts for the sides to meet on October 7 failed. The union said the NBA demanded a 50–50 revenue split <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>meeting,</b> while the league refuted making any such demands. After talks on October 9 and 10, the two sides were unable to reach a deal and Stern subsequently {{canceled the}} first two weeks of regular-season games, which were originally scheduled to begin on November 1. [...] BRI remained the main issue, but other differences included luxury tax, player contract length, and the mid-level exception. The owners proposed a $2 tax for every $1 that a team spends above the tax threshold for player salaries. The tax would rise to as high as $4 for every $1 above the limit for teams that are repeat offenders. The previous CBA in comparison called for a $1 tax for every $1 over the limit. The players refused to accept a hard salary cap, which they felt the more punitive luxury taxes would effectively create. Stern said the owners felt a harsher luxury tax would make the league more competitive. Wade countered that a small-market team like the San Antonio Spurs had won multiple championships. Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College, said that [...] "the statistical correlation between payroll and win percentage is practically nonexistent" [...] in the NBA. ESPN concluded that a team's draft efficiency accounted for 34% of its winning percentage in the past decade, while payroll showed only a 7% correlation. The New York Times noted that a fairer system was needed for the small-market teams, but the league's popularity historically relied on predictably successful teams with multiple superstars.|$|E

Moody, whose musician was Ira D.
