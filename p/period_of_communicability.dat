40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{problem in the}} study of complex networks is to provide quantitative measures of correlation and information flow between different parts of a system. To this end, several notions <b>of</b> <b>communicability</b> have been introduced and applied {{to a wide variety of}} real-world networks in recent years. Several such communicability functions are reviewed in this paper. It is emphasized that communication and correlation in networks can take place through many more routes than the shortest paths, a fact that may not have been sufficiently appreciated in previously proposed correlation measures. In contrast to these, the communicability measures reviewed in this paper are defined by taking into account all possible routes between two nodes, assigning smaller weights to longer ones. This point of view naturally leads to the definition <b>of</b> <b>communicability</b> in terms <b>of</b> matrix functions, such as the exponential, resolvent, and hyperbolic functions, in which the matrix argument is either the adjacency matrix or the graph Laplacian associated with the network. Considerable insight on communicability can be gained by modeling a network as a system of oscillators and deriving physical interpretations, both classical and quantum-mechanical, <b>of</b> various <b>communicability</b> functions. Applications <b>of</b> <b>communicability</b> measures to the analysis of complex systems are illustrated on a variety of biological, physical and social networks. The last part of the paper is devoted to a review of the notion of locality in complex networks and to computational aspects that by exploiting sparsity can greatly reduce the computational efforts for the calculation <b>of</b> <b>communicability</b> functions for large networks.

The evidence presented by various authors in regard to this subject has been critically reviewed by Gordon (1). The following conclusions appeared justified on epidemiologic grounds: (a) The average incubation period of typical mumps was shown to be 18 days. The disease was found to become communicable about 48 hours prior to the onset of glandular enlargement and the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>communicability</b> to last for several days following the appearance of signs of illness. (b) Cases of unusual manifestations of mumps, such as primary meningoencephalitis or primary orchitis {{in the absence of}} recognized involvement of the salivary glands, could be properly classified only if they occurred in institutions or families where typical mumps was prevalent.

Occasionally the carrier state may persist for several months. Antibiotics known to be effective against the infecting strains shorten the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>communicability</b> but are not recommended for treatment.

30|$|The {{similarity}} {{comparisons of}} networks {{requires that the}} type of similarity in question is defined. Here we are not interested in local structural similarity, because local structure itself is not enough in deciding which concepts are the key concepts. Instead, the similarity comparisons must focus on the <b>communicability</b> <b>of</b> nodes in the network. The similarity we are interested in here is such that networks, where the same nodes have high communicabilities, are taken as similar: the more they share the same high communicability nodes, the more similar they are in all relevant aspects, irrespective of how the low values <b>of</b> <b>communicabilities</b> are distributed within the remaining nodes. When link weights are normalised, the “high” value <b>of</b> the <b>communicability</b> is taken to be those ones which exceed the limiting value 0.50. In a collated network consisting of 121 nodes, roughly 30 % of the nodes have a communicability higher than 0.50 and 15 % higher than 0.70. However, a direct comparison based on distributions <b>of</b> <b>communicability</b> values and standard similarity measures which pay attention to the whole distribution e.g. by using Kullback-Leibler divergence (Kolaczyk 2009) is not an option, because nodes with low values <b>of</b> <b>communicability</b> are not <b>of</b> interest and not relevant to the similarity.|$|R

Bissell, director of laboratories; Dr. W. S. Goodale, superintendent of hospitals and dispensaries; Dr. Dewitt Sherman, special diagnostician for the department and responsible for positive diagnoses; Dr. George S. Staniland, {{of the board of}} hospitals; and Dr. F. B. Willard, medical sanitary inspector of the department. • Procedures: the conference decided on procedures to follow in suspected cases and submitted to the public some general information on the illness. They determined the following: All suspected cases should be called Spanish influenza unless diagnosed otherwise. The infectious agent is probably bacillus influenza and other infectious agents, but research is necessary. The infection comes from secretions of the nose, throat, and respiratory passages of cases and carriers, and has an incubation period of 1 - 4 days (usually two-). It is transmitted by direct contact, or indirect contact through objects contaminated with secretions. Its <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>communicability</b> is unknown. It can be recognized by clinical manifestations and laboratory testing. Complications include pneumonia, sinus infections and otitis media. The mortality of influenza is so far very low. Quarantines may occur at the discretion of the health department, but all cases should definitely be isolated. Individuals should avoid crowded public situations. Laundry should be boiled before sending to the laundry service, and it should be shipped in a separate container marked as influenza infected. The laundry service has the discretion to refuse cleaning service, and should refuse if it cannot apply proper precautions. It is advised that all laundry be cleaned on the infected premises. • Disinfection: is necessary and occurs in a variety of ways. These include: appropriate disposal of discharges from the mouth, nose, throat, and respiratory passages; disinfection by cleaning, airing, and sunning because influenza cannot survive long outside of a host; disinfection of local deceased who died of influenza or complications before being placed in a coffin followed by sealing in a casket that will not be opened again, and inspection of deceased shipped from foreign locations. • Treatment: Attendants aiding the sick should wear gauze masks. Children must be excluded from school attendance for seven days following a report of illness. All cases must be reported to the health department. The usefulness of immunization is questionable. Hospital treatment is inappropriate unless it maintains “segregation and isolation,” and care should be determined by the attending physician. Patients should be treated in well-ventilated warm rooms to prevent broncho-pneumonia. Newspaper article...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{epidemiological}} situation {{in the incidence of}} measles in the Czech Republic and possibilities of influencing their unfavourable situation in Europe. Measles is a highly contagious disease of viral origin, which has {{a significant impact on the}} health of the child population in particular. The most effective protection against the measles is vaccination. The introduction of measles vaccination positively affected the epidemiological situation in the world. Priority of the WHO (World Health Organization, WHO, hereinafter) is elimination of the measles. The long term goal of the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC hereinafter) was the elimination of measles in the European region by 2010. This goal was not achieved. The cause was low immunization coverage of certain population groups in several European countries. The prerequisite of achieving elimination of measles is that the vaccination coverage in the population is high. Many countries, thanks to effective vaccination strategy, succeeded in reducing the incidence of measles. In the years 2007 - 2009 the historically lowest incidence, of less than 10 measles cases per million inhabitants, in the European region was achieved. In subsequent years, there was again a rise in measles morbidity. A repeated rise in cases of the disease is attributed to the expansion of social groups where vaccination coverage was inadequate in terms of achieving herd immunity. The thesis is divided into theoretical and practical part. The theoretical part is divided into four main chapters. The first chapter describes the history of measles, the origin of the name of the disease and the first mention of it. The second theoretical chapter is devoted to the clinical characteristics of measles. In subchapters it describes the clinical picture of the disease, possible complications of the disease, how the infection is diagnosed and what treatment options there are. The third chapter defines the epidemiological characteristics of the disease. The subheads are aimed at the cause of the disease, possible ways of transmission, incubation period, <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>communicability,</b> susceptibility and incidence of this disease. At last, the fourth chapter of the theoretical part desribes possible epidemiological measures, which include measles surveillance, preventive and repressive measures and vaccination. The practical part of the thesis was elaborated through quantitative research - secondary data analysis. Analysed data were obtained from the information system for reporting and recording infectious diseases EPIDAT on Regional Hygiene Station of South Bohemian Region, based in Budweis and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The data on population, in terms of age groups and individual regions, were drawn from the demographic yearbooks, which are available on the website of the Czech Statistical Office. The resulting data were subsequently processed in tabular and graphical forms in Microsoft Excel. The research objectives were: 1) to set charting trends in the incidence of measles in the Czech Republic and Central Europe over the period 2004 - 2013, 2) to compare the incidence of measles in the individual regions of the Czech Republic, and 3) to identify the reasons for gaps in vaccination coverage against measles in the South Bohemian Region. Based on the above stated objectives, the five research questions were defined. The results are intended to highlight the issues of possible adverse influence on the epidemiological situation in the incidence of measles in Europe. This thesis can be used as a source of information on trends in incidence, vaccine development and immunization status for measles...|$|E

Moreover, as shown by results in Table 3 only for logβ=− 2 the <b>communicability</b> and strength <b>of</b> node are strongly correlated. This difference in values <b>of</b> <b>communicability</b> and strength show that epistemic weighting of long contiguous paths depend sensitively on quality of epistemic substantiation and thus it provides more information of the epistemic substantiation than strength of node.
