25|$|The {{existing}} bridge had a <b>planned</b> <b>design</b> life of 120 years, but by {{the early}} years of the 21st century the planned theoretical capacity for the bridge was being routinely exceeded. It was designed for up to 11 million vehicles per year, but this had risen steadily to 23 million vehicles in 2006. Between 2003 and 2005, an inspection programme found that the main suspension cables had suffered an estimated 8–10% loss of strength as a result of corrosion. Projections highlighted the likelihood of an accelerating loss of strength, with traffic restrictions to limit loading required in 2014 in the worst-case scenario.|$|E
25|$|Lahm {{originally}} {{dictated that}} the location be within 10 miles of San Antonio, but difficulties finding a site {{suited to the}} <b>planned</b> <b>design,</b> and the large size required, forced a resumption of the search in October 1927 out to an expanded distance of 30 miles. While the location problem was being settled, Lahm assigned Clark to begin work on plans and layout of the new base on December 8, 1927. A location near Schertz, 18 miles from San Antonio, was obtained by the San Antonio Chamber of Commerce and offered to Lahm {{on the last day}} of 1927, who sent the proposal to Secretary of War Dwight F. Davis. In February Congress authorized President Calvin Coolidge to accept the gift, but it was August 16, 1928, before the legal processes ran their course and the property acquired.|$|E
25|$|The {{small size}} of the tree and some dwarfing of foliage result from pruning the trunk, branches, and roots. Pruning is often {{the first step in}} {{transforming}} a collected plant specimen into a candidate for bonsai. The top part of the trunk may be removed to make the tree more compact. Major and minor branches that conflict with the designer's plan will be removed completely, and others may be shortened to fit within the <b>planned</b> <b>design.</b> Pruning later in the bonsai's life is generally less severe, and may be done for purposes like increasing branch ramification or encouraging growth of non-pruned branches. Although pruning is an important and common bonsai practice, it must be done with care, as improper pruning can weaken or kill trees. Careful pruning throughout the tree's life is necessary, however, to maintain a bonsai's basic design, which can otherwise disappear behind the uncontrolled natural growth of branches and leaves.|$|E

[...] The Koster Site has been excavated and demonstrates 7,000 years of continuous habitation.
