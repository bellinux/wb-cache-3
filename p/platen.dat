His only son, Friedrich von Zieten (6 October 176529 June 1854), whose baptism Frederick witnessed, was first a captain of hussars and from 18001824 {{councilor}} of Ruppin. In 1840 he was raised to the nobility by Frederick William II of Prussia. He died in 1854, unmarried, and was buried in the local cemetery.|$|E
5|$|To {{supply the}} orders and to repay debts, Densmore began to {{manufacture}} the machine in summer 1871. During this time, {{the machine was}} revised to improve durability and the <b>platen</b> was redesigned after feedback from Western Union, which wanted the ability to print on a continuous roll, indicated that clipping paper to the <b>platen</b> was impractical. The new design, however, infringed a patent granted to Charles A. Washburn in November 1870; Washburn, consequently, received royalties on future production. In 1872, to manufacture the new machine in earnest, a former wheelwright shop was secured along with several employees. Although the machines worked well, the lack of economies of scale prevented the venture from yielding a profit. In exchange for funding the ventures, Densmore had been acquiring an ever-increasing ownership interest. Sholes was eventually bought out for a cash payment of $12,000. Glidden kept his one-tenth right of the patent. Densmore consulted with George W. N. Yost, a manufacturer {{with whom he had}} been acquainted, who suggested showing the machine to E. Remington and Sons. Remington, an arms manufacturer seeking to diversify after the Civil War, possessed the machining equipment and skilled machinists necessary to further develop the complex machine. A typewritten letter was sent to Remington, where executive Henry H. Benedict was impressed by the novelty and encouraged company president Philo Remington to pursue the device.|$|E
5|$|An {{independent}} diamond synthesis {{was achieved}} on February 16, 1953 in Stockholm by ASEA (Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget), one of Sweden's major electrical manufacturing companies. Starting in 1949, ASEA employed {{a team of}} five scientists and engineers {{as part of a}} top-secret diamond-making project code-named QUINTUS. The team used a bulky split-sphere apparatus designed by Baltzar von <b>Platen</b> and Anders Kämpe. Pressure was maintained within the device at an estimated 8.4GPa for an hour. A few small diamonds were produced, but not of gem quality or size. The work was not reported until the 1980s. During the 1980s, a new competitor emerged in Korea, a company named Iljin Diamond; it was followed by hundreds of Chinese enterprises. Iljin Diamond allegedly accomplished diamond synthesis in 1988 by misappropriating trade secrets from GE via a Korean former GE employee.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{observations}} {{suggests that}} concrete specimens subjected to uniaxial tension {{may have different}} responses depending on the imposed kinematic ‘‘constrains”. A simple model is proposed here to explain the experimental findings. Concrete specimens are schematized as a system composed of three trusses. This model can thus consider the non-homogeneity of the material, and the eccentricity between {{the head of the}} testing machine and the specimen. Two kinds of tests are considered: imposed uniform displacement (fixed <b>platens)</b> and freely rotating <b>platens.</b> The results of the model show that the tests based on fixed <b>platens</b> provide higher peak loads. Only for a perfect specimen and testing conditions (homogeneous material and absence of geometric eccentricity) the results of a fixed <b>platens</b> test and of a rotating <b>platens</b> test coincide. Furthermore, the same results are obtained by energy balance...|$|R
40|$|The {{project was}} under taken to {{manufacture}} and consolidate the Self Reinforced Composite (SRC) material and finds the mechanical {{properties of the}} material under different temperature and cooling conditions with respect to time. In consolidation process, the pressure, temperature and time are the key factors. Hence the department used thermal press for consolidation and cooling is also important factor after consolidation process, so the <b>platens</b> were designed to facilitate rapid cooling using water/air. The temperature distribution of the thermal press without the <b>platens</b> was measured under both steady state and transient conditions. The temperature profiles of the fitted <b>platens</b> were also measured. [18] Measurements show that the temperature distribution (steady state and transient) of the <b>platens</b> is more even {{than that of the}} original press.

Of his senior command, Seydlitz was wounded {{and had to}} {{relinquish}} command to <b>Platen,</b> nowhere near his equal in energy and nerve; Wedel was wounded so badly that he never fought again; Georg Ludwig von Puttkamer, commander of the Puttkamer Hussars, lay among the dead. Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, later the inspector general and major general of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, was wounded at the battle. Ewald Christian von Kleist, the famous poet of the Prussian army, was badly injured in the latter moments of {{the assault on the}} Walkeberge. By the time he was injured, Major Kleist was the highest-ranking officer in his regiment. Generalleutnant August Friedrich von Itzenplitz died of his wounds on 5 September, Prince Charles Anton August von Holstein-Beck on 12 September, and Finck's brigade commander, Generalmajor George Ernst von Klitzing, on 28 October in Stettin. Prussia was at its last gasp and Frederick despaired of preserving much of his remaining kingdom for his heir.|$|E

25|$|On 16 December, Kolberg capitulated to Rumyantsev, {{enabling}} {{his forces}} to take winter quarter in Brandenburg-Prussian Pomerania.

Likewise, many computer plotters (which since the early 1990s have been replaced with large-format inkjet and laser printers) used rotary stepper motors for pen and <b>platen</b> movement; the typical alternatives here were either linear stepper motors or servomotors with closed-loop analog control systems.|$|E
25|$|These are folded down, so {{that the}} paper lies {{on the surface of}} the inked type. The bed is rolled under the <b>platen,</b> using a {{windlass}} mechanism. A small rotating handle is used called the 'rounce' to do this, and the impression is made with a screw that transmits pressure through the <b>platen.</b> To turn the screw the long handle attached to it is turned. This is known as the bar or 'Devil's Tail.' In a well-set-up press, the springiness of the paper, frisket, and tympan caused the bar to spring back and raise the <b>platen,</b> the windlass turned again to move the bed back to its original position, the tympan and frisket raised and opened, and the printed sheet removed.

40|$|The {{control of}} {{parameters}} such as liquid fraction, holding time, and cooling rate during thixoforming can help control the final microstructure of the thixoformed part, thus improving its mechanical properties. This study intended to investigate conditions required to obtain martensite in hypoeutectic {{gray cast iron}} at 3. 1 % CE (carbon equivalent) deformed in the semisolid state. Samples heated up to 1130, 1135, and 1145 °C (liquid fractions of 10, 30, and 45 %) were compressed into <b>platens</b> without any holding time (0 [*]s). If a sample presented a martensitic structure for 0 [*]s holding time, new samples were retested at the same temperature for 30, 60, and 90 [*]s holding times. The die casting process was simulated by allowing the <b>platens</b> to become locked after hot compression. Samples that cooled in the locked <b>platens</b> were submitted to higher cooling rates than samples that cooled with the <b>platens</b> open and presented martensite instead of the conventional ferrite and pearlite. Thus, the factor that had the greatest influence on the formation of martensite was the cooling rate rather than stress. The thixoforming process presented good morphological stability, which is highly desirable for industrial applications...|$|R

40|$|In {{automatic}} production controls a fully {{knowledge of}} all {{the state of the}} different system is often mandatory. In particular the measurement of many parameters is necessary in order to obtain the desired specification in terms of both safety requirements and protective measures for operator’s safety and in terms of system reliability in compliance with both the international standards and the correct working conditions. In the field of Injection Moulding Machine (IMM) the European Standard EN 201 is the reference standard. In particular, the mentioned standard specifies ‘‘the essential safety requirements for injection moulding machines for the processing of plastics and/or rubber’’ and ‘‘the safety requirements for the interaction between injection moulding machines and ancillary equipment’’.
