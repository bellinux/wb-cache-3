40|$|Despite various {{policing}} {{strategies in}} the recent past, the police alone {{have not been able}} reduce crime in Soshanguve. Research into how <b>partnerships</b> <b>in</b> policing can assist in finding solutions to crime prevention is limited. The police have come to realise that they need the active involvement and cooperation of and support from the community and other role players to prevent crime. This research has as its aim the identification of the challenges <b>in</b> establishing <b>partnerships</b> <b>in</b> policing the Soshanguve policing area. A qualitative approach was adopted. An interview schedule with predetermined questions was designed, piloted and used in focus group interviews with participants who are actively involved <b>in</b> <b>partnerships</b> <b>in</b> policing in the area. Interviews were conducted with 45 participants in three focus group interviews to obtain their views, opinions and perceptions of <b>partnerships</b> <b>in</b> policing. The collected data was transcribed verbatim (using words and phrases of the participants), analysed and interpreted. The data was analysed and interpreted using manual open coding, with the aim of identifying and examining patterns of similarities or differences in the data. A literature study was conducted {{to gain a better understanding}} of <b>partnerships</b> <b>in</b> policing. Research indicates that <b>partnerships</b> <b>in</b> policing have been effectively implemented in other parts of the world and can be implemented in South Africa in general and in Soshanguve in particular. Factors that inhibit <b>partnerships</b> <b>in</b> policing between the police and the community as well as in other environments were identified. These factors include among others, lack of trust, communication and cooperation. Recommendations are made to all concerned; particularly to the South African Police Service management on how <b>partnerships</b> <b>in</b> policing can be effectively implemented.
