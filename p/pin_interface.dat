40|$|The {{exchange}} interaction {{determines the}} ferromagnetic (FM) or antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of atomic spins. When ferromagnets and antiferromagnets are coupled together, they often exhibit the exchange bias effect, a unidirectional interface exchange field causing {{a shift of}} the magnetic hysteresis loop. The effective magnitude of this interface exchange field is at most a few percent of the bulk exchange, arising from pinned interfacial spins in the antiferromagnet. The pinned spins are known to comprise {{a small fraction of}} the total number of interface spins, yet their exact nature and physical origin has so far been elusive. Here we show that in the technologically important γ - IrMn_ 3 /CoFe structure the <b>pinned</b> <b>interface</b> spins are in fact delocalised over the whole <b>interface</b> layer. The <b>pinned</b> spins arise from the small imbalance of the number of spins in each magnetic sublattice in the antiferromagnet due to the natural atomic disorder. These pinned spins are strongly coupled to the bulk antiferromagnet explaining their remarkable stability. Moreover, we find that the ferromagnet strongly distorts the interface spin structure of the antiferromagnet, causing a large reversible interface magnetisation that does not contribute to exchange bias. The unexpected delocalised nature of the <b>pinned</b> <b>interface</b> spins explains both their small number and their stability, uncovering the mysterious microscopic origin of the exchange bias effect.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} impact of biomechanical wear and {{abrasion}} on the antibiotic release profiles of hydroxyapa-tite (HA) coated fixation pins during their insertion into synthetic bone. Stainless steel fixation pins are coated with crystalline TiO 2 by cathodic arc evaporation forming the bioactive layer for biomimetic deposition of Tobramycin con-taining HA. Tobramycin is either introduced by co-precipitation during HA formation or by adsorption-loading after HA deposition. The samples containing antibiotics are inserted into bone mimicking polyethylene foam after which the drug release is monitored using high performance liquid chromatography. This analysis shows that HA coating wear and delamination significantly decrease the amount of drug released during initial burst, but only marginally influence the sustained release period. Spalled coating fragments are found to remain within the synthetic bone material structure. The presence of HA within this structure supports {{the assumption that the}} local release of Tobramycin is not only ex-pected to eliminate bacteria growth directly at the <b>pin</b> <b>interface</b> but as well at some distance from the implant. Further-more, no negative effect of gamma sterilization could be observed on the drug release profile. Overall, the observed results demonstrate the feasibility of a multifunctional implant coating that is simultaneously able to locally deliver clinically relevant doses of antibiotics and an HA coating capable of promoting osteoconduction.

These features were then used to create a new joint design. The design process was completed by analyzing the new joint for deflection, optimizing it for weight limitations and material costs, and looking at for design for manufacturing and assembly considerations. Overall, the goal of creating a new joint that could be implemented into a future iteration of the walker was achieved. by Garth S. Grove. Thesis (S. B.)

Abstract. – We {{introduce}} a Markovian model describing the paths that <b>pin</b> an elastic <b>interface</b> {{moving in a}} two-dimensional disordered medium. The scaling properties of these “elastic pinning paths ” (EPP) are those of a <b>pinned</b> <b>interface</b> belonging to the universality class of the Edwards-Wilkinson equation with quenched disorder. We find that the EPP are different from paths embedded on a directed percolation cluster, which are known to <b>pin</b> the <b>interface</b> of the “directed percolation depinning ” class of surface growth models. The EPP are characterized by a roughness exponent α = 1. 25,intermediate between that of the free inertial process (α = 3 / 2) and the diode-resistor problem on a Cayley tree (α = 1).

40|$|We {{study the}} {{spreading}} of two mutually cooperative diseases on different network topologies, and with two microscopic realizations, {{both of which}} are stochastic versions of a susceptible-infected-removed type model studied by us recently in mean field approximation. There it had been found that cooperativity can lead to first order transitions from spreading to extinction. However, due to the rapid mixing implied by the mean field assumption, first order transitions required nonzero initial densities of sick individuals. For the stochastic model studied here the results depend strongly on the underlying network. First order transitions are found when there are few short but many long loops: (i) No first order transitions exist on trees and on 2 -d lattices with local contacts. (ii) They do exist on Erdos-Renyi (ER) networks, on d-dimensional lattices with d >= 4, and on 2 -d lattices with sufficiently long-ranged contacts. (iii) On 3 -d lattices with local contacts the results depend on the microscopic details of the implementation. (iv) While single infected seeds can always lead to infinite epidemics on regular lattices, on ER networks one sometimes needs finite initial densities of infected nodes. (v) In all cases the first order transitions are actually "hybrid"; i. e., they display also power law scaling usually associated with second order transitions. On regular lattices, our model can also be interpreted as the growth of an interface due to cooperative attachment of two species of particles. Critically <b>pinned</b> <b>interfaces</b> in this model seem to be in different universality classes than standard critically <b>pinned</b> <b>interfaces</b> in models with forbidden overhangs.

40|$|Fermi-level pinning {{behavior}} {{has been observed}} at the free surface, oxide interface, metal interface, MBE grown surface, stop-regrown homojunction, and misfit-dislocation pinned heterojunction of GaAs. Theories of such behavior are numerous and disparate. Theories of ideal heterojunction band offsets are less diverse, but have still not converged to a single mechanism. Recent studies of heterojunctions suggest that the conduction-band offsets are rela-tively independent of interface Fermi-level position, including situations in which the interface Fermi-level appears to be strongly "pinned". In "ideal " heterojunctions, the conduction-band offsets and bulk doping determine interface Fermi-level location; among other results, this mechanism allows the two-dimensional electron gas at modulation-doped AlGaAs-GaAs heterojunctions. If "pinned " heterojunctions involve charge densities comparable to those infer-red for Schottky barriers, then the <b>pinning</b> <b>interface</b> states should set up a dipole sufficient to alter the band offsets; the interfacial band alignment should then be dominated by the alignment of the pinning states, rather {{than that of the}} bulk bands.
