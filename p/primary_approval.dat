In particular, the paper shows the firm but controversial "reply" to the expectations and postulates of the Kussian govermneut, public opinion and literature, connected with the involvement in the ccofliet in the Balcans {{on the side of the}} Southern Slavs. The opinions were formulated in the circles of progressive radicals, gathered round the leading organ of "the young" - "Przegląd Tygodniowy" - represented prominently by its ideological leader Alexander Świętochowski. In the course of time the <b>primary</b> <b>approval</b> gave way to criticism of imperialistic nationalism hidden behind the contemporary Pan-Slavistic ideas supported by the czarism regime. The paper is a supplement to the studies presenting the conflict from the Russian point of view and discloses the so far neglected element - the Polish point of view.

40|$|Objective(s) : Listeria monocytogens, Bacillus cereus and Campylobacter jejuni {{are three}} toxin {{producing}} bacteria over the world, especially in Iran, {{and it is}} essential to find a certain, rapid procedure to identify these microorganisms. In this research, these bacteria were simultaneously detected by multiplex PCR technique in foods. Materials and Methods: The <b>primary</b> <b>approval</b> of bacterial strains was performed by biochemical tests. PCR primers were designed based on the nucleotide sequences of the NHEB/NHEC gene of B. cereus, the hly gene of L. monocytogenes and the C gene of C. jejuni. The specificity of Multiplex PCR method was determined using seven food poisoning bacteria including Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysentery, Yersinia pestis, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum and Vibrio cholerae. To confirm the reaction, DNA extraction was performed from 30 food samples (milk), and gene amplification was performed by PCR. The length of amplified fragments was 300 bp, 210 bp and 160 bpfor NHEB/NHEC, hly and C genes, respectively. Results: The detection limits of the PCR method were 5, 4 and 3 pg for L. monocytogenes, B. cereus and C. jejuni, respectively. Specifisity test showed that this reaction is spesific to these 3 bacteria. Conclusion: In this study, we  introduced a new multiplex PCR method for simultsnus detection of L. monocytogens, B. cereus and C. jejuni. These results can be used  for detection of other toxin producing bacteria in food...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the procedure to obtain medical ethical {{approval for a}} multicentre study in the Netherlands. DESIGN: Prospective and descriptive. METHOD: The application procedure for medical ethical approval of a nationwide randomised multicentre trial (the 'Pancreatitis: surgical necrosectomy versus step up approach' (PANTER) -trial) from the ethics committees (EC) of 9 Dutch hospitals during 2004 - 2007, was prospectively evaluated. Several predefined variables regarding {{the duration of the}} ethical review process, the time invested and material and the type of queries raised by the ECs in all centres were collected. RESULTS: <b>Primary</b> <b>approval</b> by the central EC of the coordinating hospital was obtained after 192 days. The duration of the review process for each of the 18 local participating centres was 105 days (range: 35 - 361). The maximum review term of 30 days, as defined in the national guideline, was reached by only one centre. It took two years to obtain approval for all participating centres. A median of 14 different documents (range: 5 - 23) were submitted to the EC of each participating centre. A total of 8314 A 4 size papers (about 42 kg) were sent by post, 172 telephone calls were made and 136 e-mail messages were sent by the research fellow coordinating the application procedure. Of the local ECs in the participating centers, 95 % requested additional revision of the patient information sheet and 78 % requested changes in the informed consent form. CONCLUSION: Obtaining medical ethical approval for this multicentre trial in the Netherlands was a long and inefficient process, requiring a considerable investment of time and resources. Streamlining the application procedure may lead to a substantial reduction in the current unnecessary delay of starting a multicentre stud...|$|E

In 2014, API JV partners Baosteel of China and Aurizon undertook a $1.4 billion takeover of fellow partner Aquila Resources. This, combined with falling prices for iron internationally, led to uncertainty among stakeholders - including Baosteel, Aurizon, South Korean steelmaker POSCO and transnational private equity company AMCI - regarding the viability of WPIOP. According to Nick Evans of The West Australian: [...] "the project’s engineering teams were told to focus on ways to restructure the project to cut its estimated $4.5 billion capital cost". According to Evans: [...] "Dreams of a major new Pilbara port at Anketell are all but over for the near future".|$|R
50|$|Democrats {{believed}} that {{this was one of}} the most likely Senate seats to switch party control, due to the Democratic tilt of Rhode Island, as well as the fact that Chafee needed to expend part of his campaign fund to win the Republican <b>primary</b> election. Chafee's <b>approval</b> ratings also took a beating from his primary battle with Laffey and may have hurt him in the general election. Another factor that hurt Chafee was the fact that Whitehouse, the Democratic nominee, had a huge head start on him, as he was able to campaign with little opposition for at least half the year and had not had to contend with a major opponent until the general election campaign. Rhode Islanders' historically large disapproval ratings for President Bush and the Republican Party as a whole was another major hurdle for Chafee.|$|R
50|$|Changes to Utah's primary {{system could}} {{adversely}} affect Lee's chances at renomination. Presently, Utah political parties hold conventions, where delegates attend {{and vote for}} candidates. Only if a candidate fails to gain at least 60% of the vote do the top two finishers proceed to a statewide primary election. In 2010, incumbent Senator Bob Bennett finished third at the convention behind Lee and businessman Tim Bridgewater and was eliminated, with Lee defeating Bridgewater in the subsequent <b>primary</b> election. Lee's <b>approval</b> rating is much higher among the smaller group of more conservative convention delegates and a recent change in the law, backed by the group Count My Vote, allows candidates to bypass the convention by collecting signatures {{to advance to the}} primary. Thus, a less conservative challenger could challenge Lee in the primary, appealing to more moderate Republican and unaffiliated voters, who could participate in the primary. The constitutionality of the changes have been challenged in court by the Utah Republican Party.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In {{recent years}} in keeping with {{international}} best practice, clinical guidelines for common conditions have been developed, endorsed and disseminated by peak national and professional bodies. Yet evidence suggests that there remain considerable gaps between the care that is regarded as appropriate by such guidelines and the care received by patients. With an ageing population and increasing treatment options and expectations, healthcare {{is likely to become}} unaffordable unless more appropriate care is provided. This paper describes a study protocol that seeks to determine the percentage of healthcare encounters in which patients receive appropriate care for 22 common clinical conditions and the reasons why variations exist from the perspectives of both patients and providers. Methods/design: A random stratified sample of at least 1000 eligible participants will be recruited from a representative cross section of the adult Australian population. Participants' medical records from the years 2009 and 2010 will be audited to assess the appropriateness of the care received for 22 common clinical conditions by determining the percentage of healthcare encounters at which the care provided was concordant with a set of 522 indicators of care, developed for these conditions by a panel of 43 disease experts. The knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of participants and healthcare providers will be examined through interviews and questionnaires to understand the factors influencing variations in care.

40|$|Introduction: Postoperative atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) occurs in 30 – 40 % of patients after cardiac surgery. Identification of recurrent postoperative AF {{is required to}} initiate evidence-based management {{to reduce the risk}} of subsequent stroke. However, as AF is oftenasymptomatic, recurrences may not be detected after discharge. This study determines feasibility and impact of a self-surveillance programme to identify recurrence of postoperative AF in the month of posthospital discharge. Methods and analysis: This is a feasibility study, using a cross-sectional study design, of self-screening for AF using a hand-held single-lead iPhone electrocardiograph device (iECG). Participants will be recruited from the cardiothoracic surgery wards of the Royal North Shore Hospital and North Shore Private Hospital, Sydney, Australia. Cardiac surgery patients admitted in sinus rhythm and experiencing a transient episode of postoperative AF will be eligible for recruitment. Participants will be taught to take daily ECGrecordings for 1 month posthospital discharge using the iECG and will be provided education regarding AF, including symptoms and health risks. The primary outcome is the feasibility of patient self-monitoring for AF recurrence using an iECG. Secondary outcomesinclude proportion of patients identified with recurrent AF; estimation of stroke risk and patient knowledge. Process outcomes and qualitative data related to acceptability of patient’s use of the iECG and sustainability of the screening programme beyond thetrial setting will also be collected.

Consumer Navigation of Electronic Cardiovascular Tools (CONNECT) aims to test whether a consumer-focused e-health strategy provided to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non-indigenous adults, recruited through primary care, at moderate-to-high risk of a cardiovascular disease event will improve risk factor control when compared with usual care. Methods and analysis: Randomised controlled trial of 2000 participants with an average of 18 months of follow-up {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} an integrated consumer-directed e-health portal on cardiovascular risk compared with usual care in patients with cardiovascular disease or who are at moderate-to-high cardiovascular disease risk. The trial will be augmented by formal economic and process evaluations to assess acceptability, equity and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. The intervention group will participate in a consumer-directed e-health strategy for cardiovascular risk management. The programme is electronically integrated with the primary care provider 2 ̆ 7 s software and will include interactive smart phone and Internet platforms.

25|$|Angiogenesis {{represents}} an excellent therapeutic {{target for the}} treatment of cardiovascular disease. It is a potent, physiological process that underlies the natural manner in which our bodies respond to a diminution of blood supply to vital organs, namely the production of new collateral vessels to overcome the ischemic insult. A large number of preclinical studies have been performed with protein-, gene- and cell-based therapies in animal models of cardiac ischemia, as well as models of peripheral artery disease. Reproducible and credible successes in these early animal studies led to high enthusiasm that this new therapeutic approach could be rapidly translated to a clinical benefit for millions of patients in the Western world suffering from these disorders. A decade of clinical testing both gene- and protein-based therapies designed to stimulate angiogenesis in underperfused tissues and organs, however, has led from one disappointment to another. Although all of these preclinical readouts, which offered great promise for the transition of angiogenesis therapy from animals to humans, were in one fashion or another, incorporated into early stage clinical trials, the FDA has, to date (2007), insisted that the <b>primary</b> endpoint for <b>approval</b> of an angiogenic agent must be an improvement in exercise performance of treated patients.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on a {{volunteering}} experience at Merseyside Welfare Rights (MWR) from June 2015. It was possible to observe a range of procedures with regards to the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) ranging from form filling, attendance of face-to-face assessments to observation of various tribunals. The hands on involvement indicated various difficulties faced by both advisors and claimants in obtaining access to PIP. As such, this research paper analyses if these challenges could be as a result of  differences that exist in theory and in practice in relation to the application process and accessing information for PIP, from the claimant’s point of view. Upon receiving ethics <b>approval,</b> <b>primary</b> research was obtained from four PIP claimants who were represented at their tribunal by MWR. Subsequently, empirical data were collated and these have indicated that there are indeed five key differences in theory and in practice with regards to the PIP. Namely that the PIP process is not as effective as it claims to be and that the application is not fit for its purpose. This paper also exemplifies how charities such as MWR have been used by claimants to bridge the gap that exists in theory and practice. With budget cuts reducing the funding of these bridges, {{it is clear that the}} coalition government needs to reform the PIP to ensure fairness and justice for its claimants. </p...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the most suitable physical outcome measures to be used with critical care patients following discharge. ICU survivors experience physical problems such as reduced exercise capacity and intensive care acquired weakness. NICE guideline ‘Rehabilitation after critical illness’ (1) recommends the use of outcome measures however does not provide any specific guidance. A recent Cochrane review noted wide variability in measures used following ICU discharge (2). Methods: Discharged ICU patients attended a five week multidisciplinary programme. Patients’ physical function was assessed during the programme, at 6 months and 12 months post discharge. Three outcome measures were included in the initial two cohorts. The Six Minute Walk Test (6 MWT) and the Incremental Shuttle Walk test (ISWT) were chosen as they have been used within the critical care follow up setting (2). The Chester Step Test (CST) is widely thought to be a good indicator of ability to return to work (one of the programmes <b>primary</b> aims). Ethics <b>approval</b> was waived as the programme was part of a quality improvement initiative. Results: Data was collected for the initial patients attending the programme (n = 13), median age was 52 (IQR = 38 - 72), median ICU LOS was 19 days (IQR = 4 - 91), median APACHE II was 23 (IQR = 19 - 41) and 11 were men. One patient was so physically debilitated that the CST or ISWT could not be completed however a score was achieved using the 6 MWT. Another patient almost failed to achieve level 1 of the ISWT. Subsequent patients for this project (total n = 47) have all therefore been tested using the 6 MWT. Good inter-rater and intrarater reliability and validity have been reported for the 6 MWT (3). Conclusions: Exercise capacity measurement is not achievable for some patients with either the ISWT or the CST due to the severity of their physical debilitation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression are common psychological problems post discharge (4), therefore using a test with a bleep is not appropriate. Therefore, the 6 MWT is the most appropriate physical outcome measure to be used with critical care patients post discharge...|$|R
