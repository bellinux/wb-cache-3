40|$|The current {{research}} examines a moderator who predicts in what situations punishment can have detrimental effects on cooperation. We hypothesized {{that when a}} punishment system is perceived as procedurally unfair, people's cooperation level decreases. Results of two experiments indicated that participants cooperated less in a group-based trust game when punishment was inconsistent between <b>persons</b> (<b>i.</b> e. not all group members would be punished for defection) than when punishment was consistent between <b>persons</b> (<b>i.</b> e. any group member who defected would be punished) or {{when there was no}} punishment. These effects were mediated by perceived belongingness. The authors conclude that an unfair punishment system leads people to feel marginalized as a group member, and this prompts them to display less cooperation. © 2008 The British Psychological Society...|$|R
