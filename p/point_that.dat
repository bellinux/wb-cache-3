5|$|The Spanish army, led by Francisco Verdugo, with Lieutenant-Colonel Johann Baptista von Taxis {{as second}} in command, was {{deployed}} before {{the village of}} Noordhorn and behind broken ground with only one access <b>point</b> <b>that</b> was covered by a wide ravine and flanked on its left {{by a series of}} muddy ditches. Aiming to create a trap for Norreys' army, the Spanish had smoothed the ground on their right in order to funnel English units and draw Norrey's troops into an engagement area where a crossfire effect could be created. Verdugo himself drove two stakes into the ground to mark the <b>point</b> <b>that</b> his cavalry was to charge upon the English vanguard.|$|E
5|$|A {{fusible plug}} is a {{threaded}} metal cylinder usually of bronze, brass or gunmetal, with a tapered hole drilled completely through its length. This hole is sealed {{with a metal}} of low melting <b>point</b> <b>that</b> flows away if a pre-determined, high temperature is reached. The initial use of the fusible plug was as a safety precaution against low water levels in steam engine boilers, but later applications extended its use to other closed vessels, such as air conditioning systems and tanks for transporting corrosive or liquefied petroleum gasses.|$|E

30|$|Shallow depth is for <b>points</b> <b>that</b> {{are less}} than 2000  ft. TVD, deep is for {{pressure}} <b>points</b> <b>that</b> are more than 9000  ft. in depth, and the moderate depth is between.|$|R
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the weight}} function gives the most {{weight to the}} data points nearest the point of estimation and the least weight to the data <b>points</b> <b>that</b> are furthest away. The use of the weights {{is based on the}} idea <b>that</b> <b>points</b> near each other in the explanatory variable space {{are more likely to be}} related to each other in a simple way than <b>points</b> <b>that</b> are further apart. Following this logic, <b>points</b> <b>that</b> are likely to follow the local model best influence the local model parameter estimates the most. <b>Points</b> <b>that</b> are less likely to actually conform to the local model have less influence on the local model parameter estimates.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{are useful for}} preventing further episodes of gout, including allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid. Long term medications are not recommended until a person has had two attacks of gout, unless destructive joint changes, tophi, or urate nephropathy exist. It is not until this <b>point</b> <b>that</b> medications are cost-effective. They are not usually started until one to two weeks after an acute flare has resolved, due to theoretical concerns of worsening the attack. They are often used in combination with either an NSAID or colchicine {{for the first three}} to six months.|$|E
5|$|After Olander, Williams, and Johnson had recovered, the six musicians {{set to work}} {{on their}} debut album. In doing so, Johnson soon {{discovered}} that the injuries to his hands had altered his dexterity on the mandolin, and threatened to walk away after Powell offhandedly remarked that he would have Roe dub in his own tenor harmonies instead of having Johnson sing them. The band also had commitments to finish as the Tennessee River Boys, to the <b>point</b> <b>that</b> they occasionally had to promote themselves under both names in the same day.|$|E
5|$|After some {{statements}} made by NBC's Entertainment head Ben Silverman {{about the future of}} the show and the fact that everything seemed to <b>point</b> <b>that</b> Friday Night Lights wouldn't return after the writers' strike, fans put together several campaigns. Save FNL Campaign raised money to send footballs and contributions to charity foundations that were related to the show. The Save FNL Campaign raised a total of $15,840 for 18,750 footballs, $2061 for charity, and $924 worth of DVDs for troops stationed overseas.|$|E
2500|$|The {{solutions}} for the map are no longer curves, but <b>points</b> <b>that</b> hop in the phase space. [...] The orbits are organized in curves, or fibers, which are collections of <b>points</b> <b>that</b> map into themselves under {{the action of the}} map.|$|R
50|$|Change {{of colors}} {{does not affect}} the {{wallpaper}} group if any two <b>points</b> <b>that</b> have the same color before the change, also have the same color after the change, and any two <b>points</b> <b>that</b> have different colors before the change, also have different colors after the change.|$|R
30|$|In {{nonlinear}} dynamics, we {{have two}} different types of <b>points.</b> <b>Points</b> <b>that</b> leave the interval after a finite number are in a stable set of infinity. <b>Points</b> <b>that</b> never leave the interval after any number of iterations have bounded orbits. So, an orbit is bounded if there exists a positive real number such that the modulus of every point in the orbit is less than this number. The collection of <b>points</b> <b>that</b> are bounded, i.e., there exists M such that |Q^n(z)|≤M, for all n, is called a prisoner set, while the collection of <b>points</b> <b>that</b> are in the stable set of infinity is called an escape set. Hence, the boundary of the prisoner set is simultaneously the boundary of the escape set and that is the Mandelbrot set for Q.|$|R
5|$|American reviewers were {{enthusiastic}} of Deep Purple's {{live performances}} {{and the lack}} of a new successful single apparently did not ruin the positive perception of the band in the US, to the <b>point</b> <b>that</b> they were often addressed as an American band. Band members even thought about transferring their residence in the United States, but renounced when they learned that the 21 year old Paice could be drafted for the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|As a result, the {{memorial}} stone became {{the memorial}} itself. The monument was later {{moved by the}} authorities {{to make way for}} the gentrification of the Fullerton Building, and was relocated to the National Archives of Singapore, where it stands almost forgotten today. The authorities hope that when Singapore's community of values had evolved to the <b>point</b> <b>that</b> a common language of art could be used to complete the task of building such a monument again.|$|E
5|$|Australia played Pakistan at Karachi in {{the first}} Test between the two {{countries}} on a matting pitch, rather than the more familiar grass pitch. Miller top-scored {{in the first}} innings with 21, as Australia fell for 80. He took 2/40 and then scored 11 in the second innings as Australia fell to defeat. It was the last Test of his career, as his knee injury deteriorated to the <b>point</b> <b>that</b> he could not play in the three Tests against India, and retired upon his return to Australia.|$|E

5|$|Before the murders, Kovář's family became {{worried about}} his mental state to the <b>point</b> <b>that</b> they {{contacted}} authorities in connection with his possession of gun license. Just {{four days before the}} murders, Kovář had received a police request to present a new health clearance under the threat of revoking his license. Before entering the Družba restaurant, Kovář visited at least two other venues. Those, however, had fewer customers, and Kovář left them immediately after entering.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{ordered his}} field {{officers}} {{to inspect the}} troops and to report back with the condition of his troops. The number of men wounded and killed had depleted his troops to a <b>point</b> <b>that</b> he judged that {{he could no longer}} hold back the Union forces at his front lines. Ammunition in the camp was also dwindling; each man had no more than ten cartridges apiece. With their supplies destroyed by Stoneman's troops at the towns of Wytheville and Abingdon, there was little hope of being resupplied or reinforced in the near future.|$|E

30|$|The {{modified}} side-sensitive (MSS) synthetic scheme {{gives an}} OOC signal when two nonconforming points, out of H + 1 successive points, plot above (below) the UCL (LCL) which {{are separated by}} at most H - 1 conforming <b>points</b> <b>that</b> plot between the CL and the UCL (LCL), respectively (Shongwe and Graham 2016, 2018). The control charting regions of the MSS scheme are shown in Fig.  2 c. From the operation of a MSS scheme, two types of CRLs which are: the lower CRL (denoted as CRL_L) and the upper (denoted as CRL_U) are needed. A CRL_L {{is the number of}} lower conforming points (i.e. conforming <b>points</b> <b>that</b> fall within region 3 in Fig.  2 c) that are plotted in between the two consecutive lower nonconforming points (i.e. nonconforming <b>points</b> <b>that</b> fall below the LCL, including the lower nonconforming point at the end). However, a CRL_U is the number of upper conforming points (i.e. conforming <b>points</b> <b>that</b> fall within region 2 in Fig.  2 c) that are plotted between the two consecutive upper nonconforming points (i.e. nonconforming <b>points</b> <b>that</b> fall above the UCL, including the nonconforming point at the end). Note that the absence of a conforming <b>point</b> implies <b>that</b> either the CRL_U or CRL_L equals one.|$|R
30|$|Destinations are {{selected}} based on a staleness factor, <b>that</b> is, <b>points</b> <b>that</b> have not been reached yet by the swarm as a whole are highest priority, whereas <b>points</b> <b>that</b> have been visited further in the past are slightly lower, and <b>points</b> <b>that</b> have been recently visited are the lowest in priority. If one UAV is already seeking a point, a different point is chosen. If all points are already chosen, the UAV chooses an optimal point based on staleness factor. Using this method, the swarm of UAVs will effectively scatter across the disaster area, searching multiple different points simultaneously.|$|R
