40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} learning logic programs without explicit negative examples by exploiting an assumption of output completeness. A mode declaration is supplied for the target predicate and each training input {{is assumed to be}} accompanied by all of its legal outputs. Any other outputs generated by an incomplete program implicitly represent negative examples; however, large numbers of ground negative examples never need to be generated. This method has been incorporated into two ILP systems, Chillin and IFoil, both of which use intensional background knowledge. Tests on two natural language acquisition tasks, case-role mapping and <b>past-tense</b> <b>learning,</b> illustrate the advantages of the approach...|$|R

The population of research was all of the 8 th graders of Junior High Schools in Sragen Regency in academic year of 2014 / 2015. The sample was taken using stratified cluster random sampling. The samples of research consisted of 297 (102 students for TPS class, 96 students for PBL class, and 99 students for direct learning). The instruments used for collecting data were mathematic learning achievement test and prior competency test of students. The instruments of achievement test and prior competency were tried out for finding content validity, difficulty level, distinguishing power, and reliability. The equilibrium test was carried out using a one-way variance analysis with different cells, {{so that it could}} be concluded that the sample derived from the population with equal prior competency. The prerequisite test included normality test using Lilliefors method and homogeneity test using Bartlett method with Chi Square test. With Î± = 0. 05, it could be concluded that the sample derived from the normally distributed population with same variance. The data analysis was conducted using a two ways analysis with different cells that was then followed by a multiple comparative test using Scheffe method. Considering the result of hypothesis testing, the following conclusions could be drawn. (1) The students treated with PBL <b>learning</b> <b>model</b> with scientific approach provided better learning achievement than those treated with TPS and those treated with direct <b>learning</b> <b>model.</b> The students treated with TPS <b>learning</b> <b>model</b> with scientific approach provided equal mathematics learning achievement to those treated with direct learning. (2) The students with high prior competency had better learning achievement than those with medium and those with low prior competencies. The students with medium prior competency had better learning achievement than those with low one. (3) In the TPS <b>learning</b> <b>model</b> with scientific approach and direct <b>learning</b> <b>model,</b> the students with high and medium prior competencies had better learning achievement than those with low one. In the PBL <b>learning</b> <b>model</b> with scientific approach, the students with high prior competency had better learning achievement than those with low prior competencies and both of them provided the same learning achievement than those with medium one. (4) The students with high prior competency category had the same learning achievement in TPS type of <b>learning</b> <b>model</b> with scientific approach, PBL <b>learning</b> <b>model</b> with scientific approach or direct <b>learning</b> <b>model.</b> In medium prior competency category, PBL <b>learning</b> <b>model</b> with scientific approach provided better learning achievement than TPS <b>learning</b> <b>model</b> with scientific approach did, and provided the same learning achievement as the direct <b>learning</b> <b>model</b> did.
