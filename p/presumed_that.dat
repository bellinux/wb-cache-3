5|$|Degsastan {{appears not}} to have been the first battle between Áedán and the Bernicians. The death of his son Domangart {{in the land of the}} Saxons is {{mentioned}} by Adomnán, and it is <b>presumed</b> <b>that</b> Bran died in the same otherwise unrecorded battle.|$|E
5|$|Alkin made {{financial}} claims {{from the state}} for her nursing, {{some of which were}} paid, although a petition of 1654 refers to her severe illness. The same letter stated that she had had to sell many of her possessions, including her bed. A petition for financial relief from May 1655 is the last recorded note on her, and it is <b>presumed</b> <b>that</b> she died soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|An {{expedition}} to Ross by King William {{and his brother}} Earl David in 1179 may have been related to Harald's activities. Two years later the rebellion of Domnall, son of Máel Coluim mac Uilleim, broke out in Ross and Moray, and it is <b>presumed</b> <b>that</b> Earl Harald {{played a part in}} this. The rebellion was not finally suppressed until 1187.|$|E

It is <b>presumed</b> <b>that</b> the more obscure city would be the less likely error.

5|$|It {{has long}} been <b>presumed</b> <b>that</b> {{there is a common}} cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism's {{characteristic}} triad of symptoms. However, there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>presumed</b> <b>that</b> Peter was {{a native}} of Italy, like {{the other members of the}} Gregorian mission. This mission was {{dispatched}} by Pope Gregory the Great in 596 to Christianize the Anglo-Saxons from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism. It landed in Kent in 597, and soon converted King Æthelberht of Kent, who gave Augustine the land on which he founded the abbey that later became St Augustine's, Canterbury.|$|E
3000|$|Let A be some SAT solving algorithm. Hereinafter we <b>presume</b> <b>that</b> A is complete, i.e. it halts {{on every}} input. We also <b>presume</b> <b>that</b> A is a non-randomized {{deterministic}} algorithm. We denote the total runtime of A {{on all the}} SAT instances from Δ _C([...] X̃) as t_C,A([...] X̃). Below we suggest a method for estimating t_C,A([...] X̃).|$|R

5|$|The {{antibodies}} {{found in}} LEMS associated with lung cancer also bind to calcium channels in the cancer cells, {{and it is}} <b>presumed</b> <b>that</b> the antibodies originally develop {{as a reaction to}} these cells. It has been suggested that the immune reaction to the cancer cells suppresses their growth and improves the prognosis from the cancer.|$|E
5|$|The exosome {{is a key}} {{complex in}} {{cellular}} RNA quality control. Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotes possess highly active RNA surveillance systems that recognise unprocessed and mis-processed RNA-protein complexes (such as ribosomes) prior to their exit from the nucleus. It is <b>presumed</b> <b>that</b> this system prevents aberrant complexes from interfering with important cellular processes such as protein synthesis.|$|E
5|$|Claudius was a heretic in {{the view}} of Dungal and Jonas of Orléans, who later wrote to refute some of his teachings {{at the request of the}} emperor. The last {{recorded}} act of Claudius is in a charter of the monastery of St Peter at Novalesa in May 827. He was dead by the time Dungal finished his Responsa contra peruersas Claudii Taurinensis episcopi sententias late in 827, so it can be <b>presumed</b> <b>that</b> he died that year.|$|E

5|$|In October 2013, {{during the}} {{promotion}} of the previous season of the show, executive producer Al Jean revealed that a character would die in this episode. In July 2014, on the announcement of the title of the episode, several media outlets incorrectly <b>presumed</b> <b>that</b> Krusty would die. The choice of character to die was deemed by some critics as anti-climactic due to Rabbi Krustofski's minor role in the show, although other reviewers praised its conclusion to the relationship between Krusty and his father.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Sac & Fox Nation, 508 U.S. 114 (1993), {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States held that absent {{explicit}} congressional direction to the contrary, it must be <b>presumed</b> <b>that</b> a State does not have jurisdiction to tax tribal members who live and work in Indian country, whether the particular territory consists of a formal or informal reservation, allotted lands, or dependent Indian communities.|$|E
5|$|Polyadenylate polymerases {{are not as}} ancient. They have {{separately}} {{evolved in}} both bacteria and eukaryotes from CCA-adding enzyme, which is the enzyme that completes the 3' ends of tRNAs. Its catalytic domain is homologous {{to that of other}} polymerases. It is <b>presumed</b> <b>that</b> the horizontal transfer of bacterial CCA-adding enzyme to eukaryotes allowed the archaeal-like CCA-adding enzyme to switch function to a poly(A) polymerase. Some lineages, like archaea and cyanobacteria, never evolved a polyadenylate polymerase.|$|E

5|$|Some {{viewers have}} <b>presumed</b> <b>that</b> the Pennsylvania Paper & Supply Company's tower, a {{downtown}} Scranton landmark which appears in video footage shot by cast member John Krasinski for the show's opening credits, is the Dunder Mifflin office. The real company, which also sells paper and office supplies, has welcomed the exposure (and increase in business) {{and has a}} ground-floor showroom where it sells both its products and T-shirts with the tower. It plans to add a Dunder Mifflin logo to the circular insets {{near the top of}} the tower. Mifflin Avenue ends adjacent to the Penn Paper & Supply building.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet forces {{attempted}} to capture Estonia and its capital Tallinn. Stavka hoped a quick breakthrough at the Emajõgi front would open {{a path for}} the armoured units to the north, thus cutting the Army Detachment Narwa {{off from the rest}} of Army Group North. The Red Army command <b>presumed</b> <b>that</b> the main direction of retreat for the German forces would be Tallinn, and concentrated their forces there in an attempt to block the roads.|$|E
5|$|The unlockable vortigaunt mission {{provides}} {{background information}} explaining how the orange crystals {{used by the}} rift-sealing machine in Half Life: Decay are acquired and used by the Nihilanth during the final boss battle in Half Life. The two player-controlled vortigaunts battle through Marines and Black Ops in the underground Black Mesa complex to find the orange crystals {{in the back of}} a military van. At this point the screen fades and the mission is declared a success; it is <b>presumed</b> <b>that</b> the Nihilanth warps them back to Xen and installs the crystals in his cave.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two methods}} of {{construction}} {{used for the}} water channels. Clay channels date from the Middle Preclassic while stone-lined channels date from the Late Preclassic through to the Classic, with stone-lined channels from the Late Classic being the largest channels built at the site. It is <b>presumed</b> <b>that</b> the clay channels were not sufficiently effective, thus leading to the switch in construction materials and the implementation of stone-lined channels. In the Late Classic pieces of broken stone monuments were reused {{in the construction of}} the water channels.|$|E
5|$|Upon making landfall, Babe {{produced}} a storm surge of , leading to minor coastal flooding. Due to the storm's quick deterioration after moving inland, the NHC <b>presumed</b> <b>that</b> hurricane-force winds did not impact land. The highest wind gust {{was recorded in}} Grand Isle, Louisiana at 50mph (85km/h) and the highest sustained wind was recorded in Boothville, Louisiana at 45mph (75km/h). In Jean Lafitte, Louisiana, overflow from the Fleming Canal produced flooding throughout the area. The most significant damage was to croplands inundated by flood waters. Flash flooding occurred throughout {{the path of the}} former hurricane in the eastern United States, particularly in North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Any {{married person}} who alleges that {{reasonable}} grounds exist for supposing {{that the other}} party to the marriage is dead may apply to court to have it <b>presumed</b> <b>that</b> the other party is dead {{and to have the}} marriage dissolved. If the court is satisfied that such reasonable grounds exist, it may make an interim judgment of presumption of death and of divorce. In such proceedings, the fact that for seven years or more the other party to the marriage has been continually absent from the applicant, and the applicant has {{no reason to believe that}} the other party has been living within that time, is evidence that the missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.|$|E
