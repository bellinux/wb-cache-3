40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examined the}} relationship between maternal stressful life events and urogenital infection in preterm birth. A systematic literature review revealed ambivalent findings concerning the relationship between maternal stress and infection during pregnancy; the effects of this relationship on pregnancy outcome were not examined in the reviewed studies. The current study employed a biobehavioral model consisting of maternal stressful life events (illness among family members, divorced, moved, became homeless, partner lost job, mom lost job, argued with partner more than usual, partner did not want the child, inability to pay bills, got in a physical fight, partner went to jail, close friend/relative had a bad problem with drinking or drug use, and close friend/relative died) and urogenital infection (genital warts, herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea, pelvic inflammatory disease, syphilis, Group B streptococcus, bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, yeast infection, urinary tract infection, and other infection) {{to examine the relationship between}} these variables in preterm birth. Data from 1, 647 respondents of the 2005 Florida Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System survey were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square and student t- tests, analysis of variance, and structural equation modeling (SEM). Of the respondents, 42 % were White, 37. 8 % had <b>preterm</b> <b>deliveries,</b> and the mean age was 27. 1 years. White mothers who became homeless (p = 0. 021) or had a partner in jail (p = 0. 041) during the 12 months prior to <b>delivery</b> had more <b>preterm</b> <b>deliveries</b> as compared to full-term deliveries. Other non-White mothers who had an ill family member (p = 0. 010) had fewer <b>preterm</b> <b>deliveries.</b> In general, mothers diagnosed with Group B streptococcus during pregnancy (p = 0. 031) had fewer <b>preterm</b> <b>deliveries.</b> Black mothers diagnosed with herpes (p = 0. 006) had fewer <b>preterm</b> <b>deliveries.</b> SEM revealed a significant relationship between maternal stress and infection, in general (p < 0. 001), and among White (p < 0. 001), Black (p < 0. 001), and Hispanic (p < 0. 001) mothers. The interaction between these variables was not significant, in general, or among racial/ethnic groups.

25|$|It is {{recommended}} that women with vasa previa should deliver through elective cesarean prior to rupture of the membranes. Given the timing of membrane rupture is difficult to predict, elective cesarean delivery at 35–36 weeks {{is recommended}}. This gestational age gives a reasonable balance between {{the risk of death}} and that of prematurity. Several authorities have recommended hospital admission about 32 weeks. This is to give the patient proximity to the operating room for emergency delivery should the membranes rupture. Because these patients are at risk for <b>preterm</b> <b>delivery,</b> it {{is recommended that}} steroids should be given to promote fetal lung maturation. When bleeding occurs, the patient goes into labor, or if the membranes rupture, immediate treatment with an emergency caesarean delivery is usually indicated.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its carcinogenic properties, DES is a known teratogen, an agent capable of causing malformations in daughters and sons who were exposed in utero. DES-exposed daughters are at {{an increased risk of}} abnormalities of the reproductive tract, including vaginal epithelial changes such as vaginal adenosis (which means a type of cell normally found in the uterus, columnar cells, are also present in the vagina), an increased cervical transformation zone, and uterine abnormalities, such as T-shaped uterus. These anomalies contribute to an increased risk of infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes in prenatally DES-exposed daughters. The most recent published research on DES daughters' adverse health outcomes documented by the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) appears in the October 6, 2011 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine under the authorship of RN Hoover et al., and lists these adverse effects and risk factors: Cumulative risks in women exposed to DES, as compared with those not exposed, were as follows: for infertility, 33.3% vs. 15.5%; spontaneous abortion, 50.3% vs. 38.6%; <b>preterm</b> <b>delivery,</b> 53.3% vs. 17.8%; loss of second-trimester pregnancy, 16.4% vs. 1.7%; ectopic pregnancy, 14.6% vs. 2.9%; preeclampsia, 26.4% vs. 13.7%; stillbirth, 8.9% vs. 2.6%; early menopause, 5.1% vs. 1.7%; grade 2 or higher cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, 6.9% vs. 3.4%; and breast cancer at 40 years of age or older, 3.9% vs. 2.2%. Daughters with prenatal exposure to DES may also have an increased risk of uterine fibroids, and incompetent cervix in adulthood.|$|E

40|$|Aim: The {{main purpose}} of this article is to detect any risk of <b>preterm</b> <b>deliveries</b> at an early {{gestation}} period using uterine electromyography signals. Detecting such uterine signals can yield a promising approach to determine and take actions to prevent this potential risk. Methods: The best position for the detection of different uterine signals is the median vertical axis of the abdomen. These signals differ from each other by their frequency content. Initially, simulation is done for the real detected EMG signals: <b>preterm</b> <b>deliveries</b> (PD) EMGs and deliveries at term (DT) EMGs. This is performed by applying autoregressive model (AR) of specific order to estimate AR coefficients of these real EMG signals. Finally, after calculation of the AR parameters of the two types of deliveries, we generate two types of simulated uterine contractions by using White Gaussian Noise (WGN). Frequency parameter extraction and classification are first applied on simulated signals to test the limits and performance of the used methods. The last remaining step is the classification of the contractions using supervised classification method. Results: Results show that uterine contractions may be classified using the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The Simple Perceptron ANN is applied on the signals for their supervised classification into independent groups: <b>preterm</b> <b>deliveries</b> (PD) and deliveries at term (TD) according to their frequency content...|$|R
2500|$|Pregnant {{women who}} are {{positive}} for Hashimoto's thyroiditis may have decreased thyroid function or the gland may fail entirely.

Women who have low thyroid function that has not been stabilized are at greater risk of having an infant with: low birth weight, neonatal respiratory distress, hydrocephalus, hypospadias, miscarriage, and <b>preterm</b> <b>delivery.</b> The embryo transplantion rate and successful pregnancy outcomes are improved when Hashimoto's is treated. Recommendations are to only treat pregnant {{women who are}} TPOAb-positive throughout the entirety of their pregnancies and to screen all pregnant women for thyroid levels. Close cooperation between the endocrinologist and obstetrician benefits the woman and the infant.

2500|$|In 2012, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists officially {{endorsed}} delaying clamping of {{the umbilical}} cord for 30–60 seconds with the newborn held {{below the level of}} the placenta in all cases of <b>preterm</b> <b>delivery</b> based largely on evidence that it reduces the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage in these children by 50%. In the same committee statement, ACOG also recognize several other likely benefits for preterm infants, including [...] "improved transitional circulation, better establishment of red blood cell volume, and decreased need for blood transfusion". In January 2017, a revised Committee Opinion extended the recommendation to term infants, citing data that term infants benefit from increased hemoglobin levels in the newborn period and improved iron stores in the first months of life, which may result in improved developmental outcomes. ACOG recognized a small increase in the incidence of jaundice in term infants with delayed cord clamping, and recommended policies be in place to monitor for [...] and treat neonatal jaundice. ACOG also noted that delayed cord clamping is not associated with increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage.|$|E
2500|$|For {{otherwise}} healthy twin pregnancies where both twins are head down {{a trial of}} vaginal delivery is recommended at between 37 and 38 weeks. Vaginal delivery in this case does not worsen the outcome for either infant as compared with caesarean section. [...] There is some controversy on the best method of delivery where the first twin is head first {{and the second is}} not, but most obstetricians will recommend normal delivery unless there are other reasons to avoid vaginal birth. When the first twin is not head down, a caesarean section is often recommended. Regardless of whether the twins are delivered by section or vaginally, the medical literature recommends delivery of dichorionic twins at 38 weeks, and monochorionic twins (identical twins sharing a placenta) by 37 weeks due to the increased risk of stillbirth in monochorionic twins who remain in utero after 37 weeks. [...] The consensus is that late <b>preterm</b> <b>delivery</b> of monochorionic twins is justified because the risk of stillbirth for post-37 week delivery is significantly higher than the risks posed by delivering monochorionic twins near term (i.e., 36–37 weeks).|$|E
40|$|Some thrombophilias {{and severe}} preeclampsia may {{increase}} the risk for <b>preterm</b> <b>deliveries</b> and fetal death due to placental insufficiency. Our objective was to evaluate clinical and laboratory data as predictors of preeclampsia in a population of mothers with 3 rd trimester fetal losses or <b>preterm</b> <b>deliveries.</b> In a longitudinal retrospective study, 54 consecutive women (age range: 16 to 39 years) with normotensive pregnancies were compared to 79 consecutive women with preeclampsia (age range: 16 to 43 years).

Independent predictors of preeclampsia were past history of oligomenorrhea, WAR > 0. 8 kg/years, pre-pregnancy or 1 st trimester triglyceridemia > 150 mg/dL, and elevated acanthosis nigricans in the neck. In a multivariate logistic regression model, two or more predictors conferred an odds ratio of 15 (95 %CI [5. 9 - 37]; P < 0. 001) to develop preeclampsia (85 % specificity, 73 % sensitivity, c-statistic of 81 ± 4 %; P < 0. 0001).
