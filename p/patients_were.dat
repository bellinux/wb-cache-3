50|$|Dementia only exists when neurocognitive {{impairment}} in the <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> {{severe enough to}} interfere markedly with day-to-day function.

25|$|Spinal cord {{stimulation}} {{has been}} studied {{in the last couple}} of years. In a long case study, 8 <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> given spinal cord stimulation via insertion of a percutaneous lead at the appropriate level of the cervical or thoracic spine. Between 36 and 149 months after the stimulations, the <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> interviewed. 6 of the 8 had received initial pain relief, and three experienced long-term pain relief. Spinal cord stimulation is cheaper than brain stimulation and less invasive, and is thus a more promising option for pain treatment.|$|E

25|$|Insulin coma {{therapy was}} used in most {{hospitals}} in the US and the UK during the 1940s and 1950s. The numbers of <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> restricted by the requirement for intensive medical and nursing supervision {{and the length of}} time it took to complete a course of treatment. For example, at one typical large British psychiatric hospital, Severalls Hospital in Essex, insulin coma treatment was given to 39 patients in 1956. In the same year, 18 patients received modified insulin treatment, while 432 <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> given electroconvulsive treatment.|$|E
25|$|Life {{aboard the}} ship {{followed}} a routine. At six o'clock, the <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> awakened and the premises were cleaned up.

25|$|A similar {{expansion}} {{took place}} in the British American colonies.

Virginia is recognized as the first state to establish an institution for the mentally ill.
