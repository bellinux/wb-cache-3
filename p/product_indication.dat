This paper is an update of the clinical section of a general guidance for the development and evaluation of microbicidal products that was first published by the International Working Group on Microbicides (IWGM) in 1996. (The preclinical section of that document will be updated separately later.) All topical microbicides should be clinically evaluated in humans for safety and effectiveness. Safety studies are necessary to evaluate the potential for systemic absorption and toxicity {{as well as local}} toxic effects, such as irritation, ulceration, burning, and itching. Reported symptoms of burning and itching are relevant to future product use and acceptability. Irritation and ulceration of the vaginal, cervical, penile, or rectal epithelium have the potential to result in an increased transmission of HIV and other STD. Effectiveness studies to assess the prevention of HIV infection or STD, depending upon the <b>product</b> <b>indication,</b> are subsequently conducted. These trials need to be large enough to detect clinically meaningful levels of protection. For spermicidal microbicides, additional contraceptive effectiveness studies are also needed...|$|E

As a case study, we selected five marketed formoterol products: Foradil® and Formagal®, capsule-based dry powder inhalers (DPIs), Novolizer® Formoterol and Oxis®, reservoir-based DPIs and Formoair®, a pressurized metered dose inhaler. We generated an algorithm based on device properties (i. e. device handling, feedback and remaining dose/end of <b>product</b> <b>indication)</b> and in vitro aerodynamic performances (i) along the product use life in optimal conditions, (ii) at different airflows and (iii) after exposing pre-loaded doses to 40 °C and 75 % relative humidity for 4 h. Based on these results, an algorithm was built where Formoair and Formagal can be proposed when there is high risk of humidity and for patients presenting suboptimal or optimal airflows. When no risk of humidity is present, Formoair, Foradil, Formagal and Novolizer Formoterol equipped with a trigger valve could be proposed for patients presenting suboptimal airflows. When no risk of humidity is present and for patients presenting optimal airflow, all products, including Oxis, could be proposed. Ultimately, the optimal inhalation product will be selected after checking the patient's preference and capacity for correct device handling and inhalation technique.

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Physiology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. Motivation Hypertension is a {{pertinent}} {{health problem}} for urban black African men (hereafter {{referred to as}} African). Sympathetic hyperactivity and a dominant α-adrenergic response pattern have both been implicated as contributing factors to their poor cardiovascular health. In addition to the deleterious effect of neurogenic hypertension on target organs, sympathetic hyperactivity may promote the accelerated progression of left ventricular hypertrophy and structural vascular disease. Aim The overarching {{aim of this study}} is to scrutinize autonomic control of the cardiovascular system in a cohort of urban African and Caucasian men during a mental challenge. Associations were investigated between potential sympatho-vagal imbalance, blood pressure and target organ damage markers to determine cardiovascular risk in ethnic male groups. Methodology The SABPA (Sympathetic activity and Ambulatory Blood Pressure in Africans) study involved the participation of 200 male teachers (99 African and 101 Caucasian) in the Kenneth Kaunda Education District of the North-West Province, South Africa. Of the participant group, HIV-infected (13 African) and clinically confirmed diabetics (1 Caucasian and 6 African men) were excluded from further analyses. Stratification was based on ethnicity and further as indicated through statistical interaction effects. Cardiovascular and autonomic responses were assessed during rest and on stressor exposure (cold pressor test and Stroop colour-word conflict test). Autonomic measures included baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS), 3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxy-phenylglycol (MHPG) and nitric oxide metabolite (NOx) levels. Cardiovascular variables consisted of blood pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume, total peripheral resistance, heart rate, arterial compliance and ST-segment from the 12 -lead electrocardiogram. Markers of target organ damage included the Cornell <b>product</b> (<b>indication</b> of left ventricular hypertrophy) and carotid intima-media thickness as indication of structural vascular disease. Means and proportions were compared by means of standard t-test and Chi-square test, respectively. Significant differences of mean cardiovascular and autonomic measures between ethnic male groups were also determined through analysis of covariance. Uni- and multivariate regression analyses were employed to demonstrate associations between target organ damage, cardiovascular and autonomic markers. Results and conclusion of each manuscript To assess autonomic nervous system and cardiovascular function as well as target organ damage, we clearly focussed on responses where our participants were challenged. Markers of autonomic responses assessed were baroreceptor sensitivity, 3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxyphenylglycol and nitric oxide metabolites. 	The first manuscript (Chapter 2) focused on left ventricular hypertrophy as marker of target organ damage, blood pressure and baroreceptor sensitivity as marker of autonomic function. The objective was to determine whether BRS was significantly lower in African men than in the Caucasian men. Furthermore, the possible association between attenuation of BRS and increased levels of ambulatory blood pressure as well as left ventricular hypertrophy was investigated in these population groups. Results revealed that the African men had significantly lower BRS stress responses. This attenuated BRS profile was coupled with dominant α-adrenergic response patterns, which was associated with an elevation of ambulatory blood pressure. BRS attenuation (rest and stress response) was not associated with left ventricular hypertrophy. It was concluded that lower BRS, especially during stress, may pose a significant health threat for urban African men regarding the development or promotion of α-adrenergic-driven hypertension and higher cardiovascular disease risk. 	The aim of the second sub-study (Chapter 3) was to investigate possible associations between structural vascular disease (carotid intima-media thickness as marker), autonomic function (MHPG as marker) and nocturnal blood pressure in the African and Caucasian men. Results showed a higher prevalence of nocturnal hypertension in the African men, with night-time blood pressure significantly higher compared to the Caucasian men. In the African and Caucasian men, carotid intima-media thickness was linearly predicted by nocturnal systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively. In conclusion, no associations were demonstrated between MHPG and carotid intimamedia thickness or between MHPG and nocturnal blood pressure. Elevated nocturnal blood pressure evidently seems to promote structural vascular disease in this cohort of urban African and Caucasian men. 	The aim of the third manuscript presented in Chapter 4, was to investigate bioavailability of NO during mental challenge (autonomic function marker) and the possible association with structural vascular disease (carotid intima-media thickness as marker). In the African men, an attenuated NOx response was demonstrated to the Stroop colour-word conflict test. After stratification into high and low NOx response groups, in the African men with a low NOx response enhanced α-adrenergic with significant STsegment depression responses was demonstrated indicating reduced myocardial oxygen supply during mental stressor exposure. Only in the African men, a ST-segment depression was significantly associated with structural vascular disease. It was concluded that the African men demonstrated a vulnerable cardiovascular profile. In this cohort of African men, the significant association between structural vascular disease and myocardial ischemia may particularly indicate a possible higher risk for future cardiovascular events. General conclusion Through the assessment of autonomic and cardiovascular responses a possible higher cardiovascular risk was demonstrated in the African men. In this cohort sympathetic hyperactivity was evident, coupled with dominant vascular response patterns and reduced myocardial oxygen supply during mental stress exposure. Based on these findings, this population group’s risk for accelerated target organ damage, as well as for future cardiovascular events, appear significantly higher than those of the Caucasian male cohort.

40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) Salt in food is {{a result}} of long term {{conditioning}} dating back to the day of salt-dried meat. Cultures with diets high in salt have a higher incidence of hypertension. Studies have shown that hypertension can be reduced by a reduction of salt in the diet Manufacturers of processed foods have developed salt reduced and low salt products in response to the Australian Dietary guideline to reduce salt, yet many of these products are not well supported in the market place. Coles, Woolworths, Franklins and Jewels in the Wyong area were surveyed to determine the availability of such products. A survey of consumers in Woolworths indicated that the majority of consumers know that salt is not good for health and yet their preference for regular salted processed food remains strong. As it takes several weeks for a high salt palate to adapt to the flavour of reduced salt foods before they taste acceptable, the consumer needs to be educated in the value of persevering with the apparently less palatable foods for long term benefits. Some consumers who are making an effort to reduce the salt content of the diet are often misguided in their choice of foods, and are easily convinced to purchase products that display a red tick of any sought in the belief that it is the 'healthy heart' symbol. This indicates a need for education in effective product selection. Processed foods tested in 1982 were assessed again {{to determine the extent to}} which the food manufacturers have responded to the dietary guidelines apart from the preparation of special <b>products.</b> <b>Indications</b> are that the majority of foods have had their salt level slightly reduced and their potassium level increased to produce foods of a more beneficial electrolyte balance.
