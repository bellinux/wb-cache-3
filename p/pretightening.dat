However, empty rotating of ball screw resulting from its inverse gap {{is the most important}} factor influencing the error compensation performance. In this paper, three grinding experiments were carried out to probe the effects of <b>pretightening</b> force magnitude on diameter accuracy. The experimental results show that too high <b>pretightening</b> force may lead to an excessive frictional resistance and thus reduce the grinding accuracy. For any specific grinding error compensation system, there exists an optimum <b>pretightening</b> force value capable of reaching the minimum grinding error...|$|E

40|$|Loading {{and contact}} stress {{distribution}} on the thread teeth in tubing and casing premium threaded connections are {{of great importance}} for design optimization, <b>pretightening</b> force control, and thread failure prevention. This paper proposes an analytical method based on the elastic mechanics. This {{is quite different from}} other papers, which mainly rely on finite element analysis. The differential equation of load distribution on the thread teeth was established according to equal pitch of the engaged thread after deformation and solved by finite difference method. Furthermore, the relation between load acting on each engaged thread and mean contact stress on its load flank is set up based on the geometric description of thread surface. By comparison, this new analytical method with the finite element analysis for a modified API 177. 8 [*]mm premium threaded connection is approved. Comparison of the contact stress on the last engaged thread between analytical model and FEM shows that the accuracy of analytical model will decline with the increase of <b>pretightening</b> force after the material enters into plastic deformation. However, the analytical method can meet the needs of engineering to some extent because its relative error is about 6. 2 %~ 18. 1 % for the in-service level of <b>pretightening</b> force...|$|E
40|$|A novel hybrid FRP-aluminum truss {{system has}} been {{employed}} in a two-rut modular bridge superstructure composed of twin inverted triangular trusses. The actual flexural behavior of a one-rut truss has been previously investigated under the on-axis loading test; however, the structural performance of the one-rut truss subjected to an off-axis load is still not fully understood. In this paper, a geometrical linear finite element model is introduced and validated by the on-axis loading test; the structural performance of the one-rut truss subjected to off-axis load was numerically obtained; the dissimilarities of the structural performance between the two different loading cases are investigated in detail. The results indicated that (1) the structural behavior of the off-axis load {{differs from that of}} the on-axis load, and the off-axis load is the critical loading condition controlling the structural performance of the triangular truss; (2) under the off-axis load, the FRP trussed members and connectors bear certain out-of-plane bending moments and are subjected to a complicated stress state; and (3) the stress state of these members does not match that of the initial design, and optimization for the redesign of these members is needed, especially for the <b>pretightened</b> teeth connectors...|$|R

40|$|An {{assembled}} plane {{truss structure}} used for vehicle loading is designed and manufactured. In the truss, the {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (GFRP) tube and the steel joint are {{connected by a}} new technology featuring a <b>pretightened</b> tooth connection. The detailed description for the rod and node design is introduced in this paper, and a typical truss panel is fabricated. Under natural conditions, the short-term load test and long-term mechanical performance test for one year are performed to analyze its performance and conduct a comparative analysis for a reasonable FEM model. The study shows that the design and fabrication for the node of an assembled truss panel are convenient, safe, and reliable; because of the creep control design of the rods, not only does the short-term structural stiffness meet the design requirement but also the long-term creep deformation tends towards stability. In addition, no significant change is found in the elastic modules, so this structure can be applied in actual engineering. Although the safety factor for the strength of the composite rods is very large, it has a lightweight advantage over the steel truss for the low density of GFRP. In the FEM model, simplifying the node as a hinge connection relatively conforms to the actual status...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Owing to {{the problem}} of week strength, {{tripping}} and bad sealing of the hollow sucker rod joints, we designs a new sucker rod joint, which has two kinds of prototypes, including tapered shoulder and round shoulder. The hollow sucker rod’s characteristic is easy disassembling, multiple sealing, and also has a large contact area of the shoulder. By using the method of finite-element analysis, we set up the finite-element model and analyze the contact stress and deformation distribution of two kinds of structure in different friction coefficients. Through the analysis, we find not only the bearing capacity of the circular arc shoulder joint, but also the sealing is also better than the tapered shoulder's joint. And for both kinds of joints, the friction coefficient is an important factor to affect the <b>pretightening</b> force...|$|E
40|$|Rotary {{ultrasonic}} machining (RUM) {{is one of}} the machining processes for advanced ceramics. Edge chipping (or chamfer), commonly observed in RUM of ceramic materials, not only compromises geometric accuracy but also possibly causes an increase in machining cost. In this paper, a three-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) model is developed to study the effects of three parameters (cutting depth, support length, and <b>pretightening</b> load) on the maximum normal stress and von Mises stress in the region where the edge chipping initiates. Two failure criteria (the maximum normal stress criterion and von Mises stress criterion) were used to predict the relation between the edge chipping thickness and the support length. Furthermore, a solution to reduce the edge chipping is proposed based upon the FEA simulations and verified by experiments...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuring the {{extraction}} {{process of the}} top coal caving working face, the fierce looseness, deformation as well as fracture of the surrounding rocks would usually occur because the slots will get strong disturbance. Meanwhile, anchored bolt and cable-bolt shall deform accordingly. When the deformation of the anchored bolt or cable-bolt comes to the extreme extent, they will crack. Then the catapulting and wounding incident will easily happen if the fractural part of the anchored bolt and cable-bolt is not fully griped by the rocks. In the paper, based on the dynamic mechanism analysis on fracture phenomenon about the anchored cable-bolt, the formulas of the kinetic energy and speed of the fractural catapult of the horizontally anchored cables in the ribs and the vertically anchored cables in the roof have been established. And a bolt support theory “small <b>pretightening</b> force & large expected anchorage strength” has been put forward, which is useful for seriously deformed roadways to prevent anchored cable-bolts from breaking. In addition, a technological method to stop anchored cable-bolt ejecting by means of pipe cap has been put forward...|$|E
40|$|Thin-walled parts {{primarily}} {{comprise the}} entire piece of rough machining, {{and the material}} removal rate can surpass 95 %. Numerous components with thin-walled structures are preferred in the aerospace industry for their light weight, high strength, and other advantages. In aerospace thin-walled workpiece machining processes and practical applications, they are excited by the vibration. The preload changing the modal stiffness of the part is found and this change causes continuous changes in the natural frequency. Researching {{on the influence of}} <b>pretightening</b> force on dynamic characteristics of thin-walled components is highly significant for controlling vibration. In this study, the typical aviation thin-walled part is the research object. Finite element numerical simulation and experimental verification are employed to analyze the dynamic characteristics of 7075 aluminum alloy thin-walled plates under different preloads for exploring the relationship between natural frequency and preload. The relationship is validated by comparative results. Both the simulation and experimental results show that the natural frequencies of plates increase following the augmentation of the preload. Thus, this research introduces the method where vibration of aerospace thin-walled parts is reduced by preload. For practical engineering application, a program showing the relationship between natural frequency and preload is written using Visual Basic language...|$|E
40|$|Graphite {{electrodes}} used in steelmaking {{are joined}} together by threaded, tapered connectors (nipples) of similar material. The jointed regions {{are subjected to}} arduous thermal and mechanical stresses during use. Mechanical stresses arise from electrode self-weight and tightening torque, and the thermal stresses from the high furnace operating temperatures which ensure a high radiative surface cooling rate as the electrode {{is removed from the}} furnace. This thermal shock effect is thought to contribute to particular types of electrode failure. In this computer-aided analysis of the stresses induced by the above effects, a commercial finite element program is used in conjunction with a purpose-written finite difference program. Mechanical loads due to electrode self-weight and <b>pretightening</b> torque are evaluated and applied with suitable restraints to an axisymmetric finite element mesh, to obtain a mechanical stress analysis. The finite difference program is then used to calculate the time-variant temperature field experienced by an electrode on being removed from the furnace. An interpolation program is used to assign temperatures at the nodes of the same finite element mesh, the thermal stresses then being evaluated by the commercial finite element program. A 'failure envelope' analysis of the results identifies the critically-stressed regions of the joint and shows that in some such areas the thermal-shock stresses act to relieve the mechanically-induced stresses. A statistical analysis based on Weibull theory predicts a high incidence of crack formation due to thermal stresses. Finally, consideration is given to the effect of thermal orthotropy and temperature-dependent material properties...|$|E
