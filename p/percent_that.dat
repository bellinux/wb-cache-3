5|$|The {{defeat of}} the U-boats in May 1943 did not signal {{the end of the}} Battle of the Atlantic. Some 60 vessels remained, and posed a threat to convoys. In later months, the Schnorchel, a device {{originated}} by the Dutch and later adopted by the Kriegsmarine after the Germans invaded the Netherlands were capable of allowing a U-boat to replace its air supply and vent its diesel exhaust without surfacing became available. However, it was sensitive to the weather, and put immense pressure and strain on crews who had to remain submerged for long period in hostile waters. Further, Coastal's Mark III radar could detect the mast. The smoke emitted was visible from 1,000 feet. In some cases the mast itself could be seen, some one foot in diameter, projecting two feet and moving at 12–15 knots. The technological response was to use High Tea, a series of sonobuoys dropped by aircraft onto the surface of the sea to detect U-boats. By late 1943, the U-bootwaffe was losing 20 percent of its strength per month. Some 70 <b>percent</b> <b>that</b> did return were seriously damaged.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In 2004, {{a survey}} of the deans of U. S. and Canadian dental schools was {{conducted}} to determine the implant dentistry curriculum structure and the extent of incorporating implant dentistry clinical treatment into predoctoral programs. The question-naire was mailed to the deans of the fifty-six dental schools in advance of the ADEA Implant Workshop conference held in Arizona in November 2004. Out of the fifty-six, thirty-nine responded, yielding a response rate of 70 percent. Thirty-eight schools (97 <b>percent)</b> reported <b>that</b> their students received didactic instruction in dental implants, while one school (3 <b>percent)</b> said <b>that</b> its students did not. Thirty schools (86 <b>percent)</b> reported <b>that</b> their students received clinical experience, while five schools (14 <b>percent)</b> reported <b>that</b> theirs did not. Four schools (10 percent) did not respond to this question. Fifty-one percent of the students actually receive the clinical experience in restoring implants, with the range of 5 - 100 percent. Of those schools that provide clinical experience in restoring implants, four schools (13 <b>percent)</b> reported <b>that</b> it is a requirement for them, while twenty-eight schools (88 <b>percent)</b> reported <b>that</b> it is not a requirement for them. Three schools (9 percent) did not respond. The fee for implants is 45 percent higher than a crown or a denture, with a range of 0 - 100 percent. Twenty-nine schools (85 <b>percent)</b> indicated <b>that</b> they did receive free components from implant companies, while five schools (15 percent) did not. The conclusions of this report are as follows: 1) most schools have advanced dental education programs; 2) single-tooth implant restorations are performed at the predoctoral level in most schools; 3) implant-retained overdenture prostheses are performed at the predoctoral level in most schools; 4) there is no predoctoral clinical competency requirement for surgical implant placement in all school...|$|R
