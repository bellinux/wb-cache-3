She posed for Gerard Malanga (of Warhol's factory), Don Snyder, <b>Push</b> <b>Pin</b> Studios, Bill Cunningham (The New York Times), Jeff Dunas for Oui Magazine and was featured in Mr. Dunas' book, Mademoiselle, Mademoiselle! in 1983. In the 70s and 80s she apprenticed with Town & Country / Harper's Bazaar photographer Bill Silano, perfecting her printing skills in the darkroom. Matuschka's experience as a photographic assistant and model was essential to her development both behind a camera and in the darkroom. Working alongside masters such as Clemens Kalischer, Bill Silano and Don Snyder, she learned the art of chemically toning and manipulating silver gelatin prints.|$|E
2500|$|For larger {{heat sinks}} and higher preloads, push pins with {{compression}} springs are very effective. The push pins, typically made of brass or plastic, have a flexible barb {{at the end}} that engages {{with a hole in}} the PCB; once installed, the barb retains the pin. The compression spring holds the assembly together and maintains contact between the heat sink and component. [...] Care is needed in selection of <b>push</b> <b>pin</b> size. [...] Too great an insertion force can result in the die cracking and consequent component failure.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{evolution}} of technique in his illustration, Grossman has said, [...] "I {{was impressed by the}} way David Levine and the <b>Push</b> <b>Pin</b> artists were using line to develop a bulgy three-dimensional feeling in their work. I found an old airbrush in my dad's shop and discovered a jiffy way to outbulge them all. For a while I diligently pursued outline-less-ness as the secret to a real stereoscopic three-dimensional look. I felt my line work belonged to a different world {{that had nothing to do}} with the airbrush and went its separate way. Lately I find a strong line reasserting itself in my pictures." ...|$|E

2500|$|The avant-garde art of Milton Glaser, Heinz Edelmann, and Peter Max became {{synonymous with}} the flower power generation. Edelman's {{illustration}} style was best known in his art designs for the Beatles' 1968 animated film Yellow Submarine. Glaser, the founder of <b>Push</b> <b>Pin</b> Studios, also developed the loose psychedelic graphic design, seen for example in his seminal 1966 poster illustration of Bob Dylan with paisley hair. It was the posters by pop artist Peter Max, with their vivid fluid designs painted in Day-Glo colors, which became visual icons of flower power. Max's cover story in Life magazine (September 1969) as well as appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and The Ed Sullivan Show, further established [...] "flower power" [...] style art into mainstream culture.|$|E

40|$|Deformation {{behavior}} in {{three-point bending test}} of Mo-Si-B alloy specimens with pre-crack was investigated byrecourse to finite element analysis (FEA) with heterogeneous microstructures incorporated. The loading configuration wascarried out by moving the top pin down, while the bottom pin remained fixed. The Mo-Si-B alloy consists of hard, brittle T 2 (Mo 5 SiB 2) phase embedded in a soft matrix of Mo solid solution. The sample contains pre-crack configuration at the middlein order to study {{the effect of the}} second phase (T 2 particles) onto a crack tip during the bending test. Real optical micrographswere scanned, digitized, and meshed into a two dimensional model with constitutive relations of both phases. It was found that the plastic strain localization was not only caused by the hard T 2 particles ahead of the crack tip, but also caused by the top <b>pushing</b> <b>pin.</b> This interaction between two strain fields was also observed if the microstructure were homogeneous. Two methodologies were explored in order to minimize this interaction in order to solely separate the effect of hard T 2 particles ahead of the crack tip. The first one was to increase the distance between the top pin and the crack tip, while the second one was to approximate the <b>pushing</b> <b>pin</b> loading by end moment application. It was found that the strain interactionstill appeared in both cases...|$|R

25|$|As power {{dissipation}} of components increases and component package size decreases, thermal engineers must innovate to ensure components won't overheat. Devices that run cooler last longer. A heat sink design must fulfill both its thermal {{as well as}} its mechanical requirements. Concerning the latter, the component must remain in thermal contact with its heat sink with reasonable shock and vibration. The heat sink could be the copper foil of a circuit board, or a separate heat sink mounted onto the component or circuit board. Attachment methods include thermally conductive tape or epoxy, wire-form z clips, flat spring clips, standoff spacers, and <b>push</b> <b>pins</b> with ends that expand after installing.|$|R
