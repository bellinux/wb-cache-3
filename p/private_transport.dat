5|$|According to the {{economic}} theory behind congestion pricing, {{the objective of this}} policy is the use of the price mechanism to make users more aware of the costs that they impose upon one another when consuming during the peak demand, and that they should pay for the additional congestion they create, thus encouraging the redistribution of the demand in space or in time, or shifting it to the consumption of a substitute public good; for example, switching from <b>private</b> <b>transport</b> to public transport.|$|E

5|$|Cluj-Napoca is an {{important}} node in the European road network, being on three different European routes (E60, E81 and E576). At a national level, Cluj-Napoca is located on three different main national roads: DN1, DN1C and DN1F. The Romanian Motorway A3, also known as Transylvania Motorway (Autostrada Transilvania), currently under construction, will link the city with Bucharest and Romania's western border. The 2B section between Câmpia Turzii and Cluj Vest (Gilău) opened in late 2010.

5|$|Only a {{very small}} {{proportion}} of the population in the USSR owned cars. Because of the widespread lack of any mode of <b>private</b> <b>transport,</b> most Soviet citizens travelled via public transport. Due to a relative shortage of cars and good-quality roads, the Soviet people travelled twice as much by bus, train and rapid transit as people in the First World. Soviet bus-transport, throughout most {{of the history of the}} Soviet Union, was controlled either by the regional or the republican branches of the Ministry of Transport. Since rail transit systems were more environmental and consumed little fuel, Soviet planners concentrated their efforts in constructing electricity-driven, rather than fuel-consuming transport. In the mid-1980s the government initiated a programme for compressed-gas energy for buses. By 1988 only 1.2 percent of buses used gas energy, while 30 percent used diesel. Soviet bus-enterprises ran a deficit for the first time in their history by the mid-to-late 1980s.|$|E
25|$|There {{are major}} {{differences}} in energy consumption for <b>private</b> <b>transport</b> between cities; an average U.S. urban dweller uses 24 times more energy annually for <b>private</b> <b>transport</b> as a Chinese urban resident.

25|$|All public {{transport}} runs on infrastructure, either on roads, rail, airways or seaways. The infrastructure {{can be shared}} with other modes, freight and <b>private</b> <b>transport,</b> {{or it can be}} dedicated to {{public transport}}. The latter is especially valuable in cases where there are capacity problems for <b>private</b> <b>transport.</b> Investments in infrastructure are expensive and make up a substantial part of the total costs in systems that are new or expanding. Once built, the infrastructure will require operating and maintenance costs, adding to the total cost of public transport. Sometimes governments subsidize infrastructure by providing it free of charge, just as is common with roads for automobiles.|$|E
25|$|Subsidies {{may take}} the form of direct {{payments}} for financially unprofitable services, but support may also include indirect subsidies. For example, the government may allow free or reduced-cost use of state-owned infrastructure such as railways and roads, to stimulate public transport's economic competitiveness over <b>private</b> <b>transport,</b> that normally also has free infrastructure (subsidized through such things as gas taxes). Other subsidies include tax advantages (for instance aviation fuel is typically not taxed), bailouts if companies that are likely to collapse (often applied to airlines) and reduction of competition through licensing schemes (often applied to taxis and airlines). <b>Private</b> <b>transport</b> is normally subsidized indirectly through free roads and infrastructure, as well as incentives to build car factories and, on occasion, directly via bailouts of automakers.|$|E

25|$|In {{selecting}} between competing {{modes of}} transport, many individuals are strongly motivated by direct cost (travel fare/ ticket price to them) and convenience, {{as well as}} being informed by habit. The same individual may accept the lost time and statistically higher risk of accident in <b>private</b> <b>transport,</b> together with the initial, running and parking costs. Loss of control, spatial constriction, overcrowding, high speeds/accelerations, height and other phobias may discourage use of public transport.|$|E
