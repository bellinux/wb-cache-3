40|$|The Union Territory of Lakshadweep is {{represented}} by twenty islands out of which only ten are inhabited. Oceanic species of tunas such as skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) are available in Lakshadweep area from October to May every year. They are being exploited from Minicoy waters by <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>tuna</b> <b>fishing</b> using live bait. Since 1960, pole-and-line fishing has been adopted in the other islands of Amini group {{with the introduction of}} mechanised boats. The seventies has seen an almost complete transition of replacement of the ' Odum' (traditional tuna fishing boats) with mechanised boats fitted with bait tanks at Minicoy Islands. Thus tuna fishing became popular in the Union Territory which is now fetching a good amount to the islanders and helping in the improvement of the economy of these islands...|$|E
40|$|A {{review is}} given of current {{information}} concerning small pelagic fishes exploited for tuna bait in the South Pacific. These fishes are usually caught over or near coral reefs using light attraction and lift nets. The {{most common and}} widespread species are anchovies (Engraulidae), sprats (Clupeidae), silversides (Atherinidae), and herrings (Clupeidae). Recorded yields ranged from 0. 5 to 2. 6 t/km 2, and methods are described to estimate potential yields empirically {{in the absence of}} catch data. Environmental effects on small pelagic fish production are discussed, and evidence is presented to suggest that rainfall markedly affects stolephorid anchovy production. Some species of small pelagic fish, such as Selar spp., Decapterus spp., and Herklotsichthys sp., have been fished traditionally by artisanal fishermen, but anchovy and sprat stocks were probably unexploited prior to <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>tuna</b> <b>fishing</b> in the South Pacific...|$|E
40|$|Tropical tuna {{fisheries}} {{are among}} the largest worldwide, with some having significant bycatch issues. However, pole-and-line tuna fisheries are widely believed to have low bycatch rates, although these have rarely been quantified. The Maldives has an important pole-and-line fishery, targeting skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis). In the Maldives, 106 <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>tuna</b> <b>fishing</b> days were observed between August 2014 and November 2015. During 161 fishing events, tuna catches amounted to 147 t: 72 % by weight was skipjack, 25 % yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and 3 % other tunas. Bycatch (all non-tuna species caught plus all tuna discards) amounted to 951 kg (0. 65 % of total tuna catch). Most of the bycatch (95 %) was utilized, and some bycatch was released alive, so dead discards were particularly low (0. 02 % of total tuna catch, or 22 kg per 100 t). Rainbow runner (Elagatis bipinnulata) and dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) together constituted 93 % of the bycatch. Live releases included small numbers of silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis) and seabirds (noddies, Anous tenuirostris and A. stolidus). <b>Pole-and-line</b> <b>tuna</b> <b>fishing</b> was conducted on free schools and schools associated with various objects (Maldivian anchored fish aggregating devices [aFADs], drifting FADs from western Indian Ocean purse seine fisheries, other drifting objects and seamounts). Free school catches typically included {{a high proportion of}} large skipjack and significantly less bycatch. Associated schools produced more variable tuna catches and higher bycatch rates. Fishing trips in the south had significantly lower bycatch rates than those in the north. This study is the first to quantify bycatch rates in the Maldives pole-and-line tuna fishery and the influence of school association on catch composition. Ratio estimator methods suggest roughly 552. 6 t of bycatch and 27. 9 t of discards are caught annually in the fishery (based on 2015 national catch), much less than other Indian Ocean tuna fisheries, e. g. gillnet, purse-seine, and longline...|$|E
40|$|Common {{dolphins}} (Delphinus delphis) {{are responsible}} for the large majority of interactions with the <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>tuna</b> fishery in the Azores but the underlying drivers remain poorly understood. In this study we investigate the influence of various environmental and fisheries-related factors in promoting the interaction of common dolphins with this fishery and estimate the resultant catch losses. We analysed 15 years of fishery and cetacean interaction data (1998 - 2012) collected by observers placed aboard <b>tuna</b> <b>fishing</b> vessels. Dolphins interacted in less than 3 % of the fishing events observed during the study period. The probability of dolphin interaction varied significantly between years with no evident trend over time. Generalized additive modeling results suggest that fishing duration, sea surface temperature and prey abundance in the region were the most important factors explaining common dolphin interaction. Dolphin interaction had no impact on the catches of albacore, skipjack and yellowfin tuna but resulted in significantly lower catches of bigeye tuna, with a predicted median annual loss of 13. 5 % in the number of fish captured. However, impact on bigeye catches varied considerably both by year and fishing area. Our work shows that rates of common dolphin interaction with the <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>tuna</b> fishery in the Azores are low and showed no signs of increase over the study period. Although overall economic impact was low, the interaction may lead to significant losses in some years. These findings emphasize the need for continued monitoring and for further research into the consequences and economic viability of potential mitigation measures...|$|R
