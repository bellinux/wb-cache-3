Analysis of the patient's RNA demonstrated the presence of only the 1529 A allele, indicating severely reduced transcription from the allele linked to the mutated promoter region.

40|$|Background: <b>Pyruvate</b> <b>kinase</b> (PK) <b>deficiency,</b> causing {{hemolytic}} anemia, {{has been}} associated to malaria protection and its prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa is not known so far.

The association between this mutation and malaria was ascertained through association studies involving sample groups from individuals showing different malaria infection and outcome status. Results: The percentage of individuals showing a reduced PK activity in Maputo was 4. 1 % and the missense mutation G 829 A (Glu 277 Lys) in the PKLR gene (only identified in three individuals worldwide to date) was identified in a high frequency.

The following hematological and enzyme kinetic parameters can serve to identify heterozygotes for PK deficiency: 1) a slight reticulocytosis, 2) an up-to-twofold increase of the intracellular concentrations of glucose- 6 -phosphate in the erythrocyte, 3) a mixed cooperativity of the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) -binding process of PK, 4) a decreased nucleotide specificity with guanosine diphosphate and uridine diphosphate, and 5) a lowered affinity for adenosine diphosphate.
