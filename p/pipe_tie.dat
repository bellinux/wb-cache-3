5000|$|Some {{academics}} dispute any indigenous {{origins of}} the mashak; researcher Ander Burton Alter wrote in 2000 that the pipes today played in Garwhal are Scottish Highland bagpipes with one bass and two tenor drones, with no local manufacturer or evidence of existence prior to British rule in 1814. [...] Organologist Anthony Baines, however, described an intermediary development stage wherein Indian musicians imitated the Highland <b>pipe</b> by <b>tying</b> [...] "an extra pipe or two" [...] into their mashak. Similarly, the New Grove Dictionary of Musical Instruments (1984) describes the traditional mashak as becoming rare as it is displaced by the Scottish pipes.|$|R

5000|$|The Skarv FPSO, {{developed}} and engineered by Aker Solutions for BP Norge, {{is one of}} the most advanced and largest FPSO deployed in the Norwegian Sea, offshore Mid Norway. Skarv is a gas condensate and oil field development. The development ties in five sub-sea templates, and the FPSO has capacity to include several smaller wells nearby in the future. The process plant on the vessel can handle about [...] of gas and [...] of oil. An 80 km gas export <b>pipe</b> <b>ties</b> into Åsgard transport system. Aker Solutions (formerly Aker Kvaerner) developed the front-end design for the floating production facility as well as the overall system design for the field and preparation for procurement and project management of the total field development. The hull is an Aker Solutions proprietary [...] "Tentech975" [...] design. [...] BP also selected Aker Solutions to perform the detail engineering, procurement and construction management assistance (EPcma) for the Skarv field development. The EPcma contract covers detail engineering and procurement work for the FPSO topsides as well as construction management assistance to BP including hull and topside facilities. The production started in field on August 2011. BP awarded the contract for fabrication of the Skarv FPSO hull to Samsung Heavy Industries in South Korea and the Turret contract to SBM. The FPSO has a length of 292 m, beam of 50.6 m and is 29 m deep, accommodates about 100 people in single cabins. The hull is delivered in January 2010.|$|R

The UM-AR-GPS-ROVER mounted to the receiver antenna on a segment of <b>pipe</b> that was <b>tied</b> to {{the interior of the}} backpack. This method proved to be inefficient in preventing lateral movement. Therefore ARMOR anchors the GPS receiver with a bolt on the summit of the helmet, so that the phase center of the receiver will never shift relative to the camera center. The relative distance between the receiver phase center and the camera center is calibrated beforehand and added to the RTK rover measurement.|$|R
40|$|In this {{technical}} study, a new {{irrigation method}} called Water Pillow (WP) was introduced. This new method {{was a combination}} of both drip and furrow irrigation methods. The main components of WP were portable plastic pipe and lateral. The plastic pipe was made from durable flexible polyethylene plastic material. The plastic pipe was pierced from the bottom sides with usually 1 mm hole. The diameter of the pipe, design and inter spacing of the holes depends on row spacing, crop and soil types. The length of plastic pipe can be arranged as the length of row. For irrigation practice, the plastic pipe was laid over soil surface between rows throughout the row length and its end was tied up then the water was filled throughout the lateral from the top part of the plastic pipe, the plastic <b>pipe</b> was <b>tied</b> up again. Water in the pipe infiltrates into soil in both vertical and horizontal directions like a drip irrigation method. The WP method does not need external energy for irrigation operation as compared to pressurized irrigation systems. The pipe remains over row space from first irrigation till harvest. On the other hand, the method has also some advantages such as preventing erosion, run off and weed control as well as efficient use of water and labor and it may also provide more crop yields...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDiagnosis of {{airfield}} pavements is {{an important}} component of airport managing. Proper diagnosis makes possible to take optimal decisions in terms of ongoing maintenance and repairs, which in the case of airfields is of particular importance, among others, in the context of seasonal changes in the intensity of air traffic. The completeness and accuracy of gathered data is important in the diagnostic activities, what means that the entire airfield road network should be measured and identification of all relevant pavement construction parameters at regular intervals should be done. These capabilities give the Ground Penetrating Radar technique (GPR), which enables the evaluation of the pavement structure in different ways and outlining different aspects of construction. GPR application as a tool supporting the process of state assessment gives a wider and better understanding of the potential damage of pavement. Properly prepared methodology of measurement, configuration and selection of the measurement system creates the possibility of observation of the investigated object, not only in a single plane of a typical radar profiling, but also in the three-dimensional image. Spatial representation obtained on the basis of synchronized profiling allows precise localization of interlayer boundaries in longitudinal and transverse directions. An important advantage of three-dimensional analysis is the ability of imaging data by the use of horizontal cuts (slices). This makes it possible to identify plane direction and depth of the cracks and crevices of concrete slabs covered with layers of asphalt or concrete. An additional element of the GPR data analysis can be quantitative assessment of dowels in concrete slabs, reinforcement of prefabricated elements supporting pavement structure, as well as location of <b>pipes,</b> cables, <b>tie</b> bars and other. The paper presents the series of examples illustrating the use of GPR technique as supporting in the process airfield pavement assessment...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} an advanced optical light pipe daylighting system {{as a means to}} deliver natural light at the back of deep-plan office buildings (15 ft to 30 ft), using optimized geometry and high reflective materials. The light pipe configurations follow a previous study at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Beltr??n et al., 1997). The current system is designed for College Station, TX (lat: 30 ?? 36 ??N), with predominantly mostly sunny sky conditions. This work consists of the monitoring of two scale models simulating a portion of a multi-story office building with open-plan configuration, with interior dimensions 30 ft x 20 ft x 10 ft, built at 1 : 4 of its real scale, one of the models being the reference case and the other the test case where the light pipe system is placed. The main objectives of this thesis are (a) to examine this daylighting system comparative to the reference case, taking measurements for longer periods than the study at LBNL, as well as to collect detailed data of its performance under different weather conditions and with different materials; (b) to evaluate the visual comfort and possible glare problems of the light pipe system through photographic evaluation and the conduction of a survey that provides people??s opinions and suggestions about the daylighting system. The light pipe system demonstrated a higher performance than the reference case in terms of appropriate levels of light and people??s preferences. The illuminance at the workplane level showed to be adequate with any of the two different diffusing materials used to spread the light into the room. The light pipe without a diffuser was the other condition observed to further understand the bounces of the sunbeam inside the reflective chamber and its consequences on the lighting output. Recommended standards for office spaces with VDT screens together with the analysis of the daylight system, led to preliminary suggestions on how to integrate the light pipe system in an open-plan office configuration. Further study is indicated to reach the complete potential of this advanced optical light <b>pipe</b> that <b>ties</b> illuminance quality with energy savings through the integration of daylight and electric light systems...|$|R
5000|$|Miriam {{attends a}} meeting of the Philadelphia Pickwick Club, a dining anddrinking men’s society and is {{inducted}} in as the only woman member. Shereceives a <b>pipe</b> and a <b>tie</b> and entertains the men with an emotional reading of“Ode to an Expiring Frog.” The show finishes with a visit to Eastern State Penitentiary, a prisonthat Dickens talked about at length in American Notes. Dickens wrote how the prisoners had to wear a hood when arriving thatprevented them seeing the path from the front gate to their cell, so they had noconcept of where in the building they were. Miriam attempts to do the samebut can’t go far before she gets too uncomfortable to go on. The prisoners were kept in solitary confinement, with only a bible to read. Naturally many went insane. Dickens was quick to see the inhumanity of this supposedly [...] "humane" [...] treatment. [...] Dickens was allowed to talk with a few of the inmates. There are none now, but the modern experience of a tourist is nevertheless haunting. The prison was closed in 1971 but is now a tourist attraction. It is in adeteriorating state, and is only maintained well enough for safety issues.They say they are keeping it in a state of “suspended ruin.” Dickens did a lot of memorable things that he did not write about inhis travel book. Perhaps the most interesting of these would be the meetingshe had with American literary figures of the day. He met Longfellow inCambridge, Washington Irving in New York and Edgar Allan Poe in Philadelphia. [...] Part Six - Washington DC and Richmond [...] Dickens traveled south by steamboat to Washington. Miriam travels alongthe Potomac in a pleasure boat. The two things that Dickens detested the most about America were slaveryand tobacco spitting, which he saw more and more of, as he traveled furthersouth. Dickens praised his first view of Washington and the capitol. (The capitoltoday is a much expanded building with a dome three times the height ofthe dome that Dickens saw.) He stayed at the Willard House. Miriam also stays at hotel, which is now called the Willard InterContinental Washington but it is another building. The current Willard was built in 1901, and is a descendant of the same hotel. Washington is known as the City of Magnificent Distances. Dickens alsocalled it the “City of Magnificent Intentions.” Miriam comments that [...] "Everywhere I look, I see a building demanding my attention.” ...|$|R
