40|$|Abstract—Phase noise causes {{significant}} degradation in {{the performance}} of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) -based wireless communication systems. The presence of phase noise can reduce the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver, and consequently, limit the bit error rate (BER) and data rate. In this paper, the effect of phase noise on OFDM wireless systems is studied, and a compensation scheme is proposed to mitigate the common <b>phase</b> <b>error</b> and intercarrier interference (ICI) caused by phase noise. In the proposed scheme, the communication between the transmitter and receiver blocks consists of two stages. In the first stage, block-type pilot symbols are transmitted and the channel coefficients are jointly estimated with the phase noise in the time domain. In the second stage, comb-type OFDM symbols are transmitted such that the receiver can jointly estimate the data symbols and the phase noise. It is shown both by theory and computer simulations that the proposed scheme can effectively mitigate the ICI caused by phase noise and improve the BER of OFDM systems. Another benefit of the proposed scheme is that the sensitivity of OFDM receivers to phase noise can be significantly lowered, which helps simplify the oscillator and circuitry design in terms of implementation cost and power consumption.

30|$|We {{handle the}} problem in the context of sparsity-driven imaging as well. Our method is based on {{simultaneous}} imaging and <b>phase</b> <b>error</b> <b>compensation.</b> Considering that in SAR imaging, the underlying field usually exhibits a sparse structure, we previously proposed a sparsity-driven technique for joint SAR imaging of stationary scenes and space-invariant focusing by using a nonquadratic regularization-based framework [12]. That work was motivated by defocusing due to, e.g., platform position uncertainties. Here, through a significant extension of that framework, we propose a method for joint sparsity-driven imaging and space-variant focusing for correction of <b>phase</b> <b>errors</b> caused by moving objects. Preliminary pieces of this work have been presented at [13, 14]. We formulate an optimization problem over the reflectivities and potential <b>phase</b> <b>errors</b> due to motion over the scene and solve it iteratively. In this formulation, we not only exploit the sparsity of the reflectivity field but we also impose a constraint on the spatial sparsity of the <b>phase</b> <b>errors</b> {{based on the assumption that}} motion in the scene will be limited to a small number of spatial locations. This constraint on <b>phase</b> <b>errors</b> helps to automatically determine and focus the moving points in the scene. We also discuss two possible extensions of this primary approach, through two alternate choices for the regularization term on the motion field. In the first extension, we use group-sparsity enforcing regularization term to impose the sparse structure. The second extension is based on low-rank sparse decomposition of the <b>phase</b> <b>error</b> matrix. More importantly, to reduce the computational complexity of this problem, we propose a second approach within the same framework to make these ideas practically applicable on relatively large scenes. In this second approach, our aim is to improve the computational efficiency of the <b>phase</b> <b>error</b> estimation procedure by first determining regions of interest (ROI) for potential motion using a fast procedure and then performing <b>phase</b> <b>error</b> estimation only in these regions. Here, note that both of these two approaches provide advantages such as increased resolution, reduced sidelobes, and reduced speckle in the imaging side thanks to the regularization-based image formation, which can alleviate challenges caused by incomplete data or sparse apertures [15] as well.|$|R
40|$|Stator flux {{estimation}} using voltage {{model is}} basically {{the integration of the}} induced stator back electromotive force (emf) signal. In practical implementation the pure integration is replaced by a low pass filter to avoid the DC drift and saturation problems at the integrator output because of the initial condition error and the inevitable DC components in the back emf signal. However, the low pass filter introduces errors in the estimated stator flux which are significant at frequencies near or lower than the cutoff frequency. Also the DC components in the back emf signal are amplified at the low pass filter output by a factor equals to. Therefore, different integration algorithms have been proposed to improve the stator flux estimation at steady state and transient conditions. In this paper a new algorithm for stator flux estimation is proposed for direct torque control (DTC) of induction motor drives. The proposed algorithm is composed of a second order high pass filter and an integrator which can effectively eliminates the effect of the error initial condition and the DC components. The amplitude and <b>phase</b> <b>errors</b> <b>compensation</b> algorithm is selected such that the steady state frequency response amplitude and phase angle are equivalent to that of the pure integrator and the multiplication and division by stator frequency are avoided. Also the cutoff frequency selection is improved, even small value can filter out the DC components in the back emf signal. The simulation results show the improved performance of the induction motor direct torque control drive with the proposed stator flux estimation algorithm.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{understanding of}} the relationship between altimetry measurement, especially significant wave height (SWH) measurement, and phase distortion is still unclear. Therefore, the objective of this Ph. D. study is first to outline this relationship by a simulation using a model that considers the errors from both the signal source and the power amplifier. The simulation results show the power amplifier influence is more significant than that of signal source in SWH estimation, and that the <b>phase</b> <b>errors</b> influence is worse for lower SWH conditions. It is recommended from the simulation that the group delay error of the whole transmitter link, after the chirp generator, should be well controlled to be under 0. 5 ns. In the payload design, Class-F is chosen as the amplifier operation mode due to its high efficiency and fewer harmonic frequency components. The difference between the operational principles of second and third harmonic peaking Class-F amplifiers have been illustrated by the simulation. Both of them can achieve high efficiency and high gain, however the third harmonic peaking Class-F is simpler to implement. Therefore it was chosen by the final design. In the simulation, a large signal STATZ model is set up, followed by the S-band Class-F amplifier design simulation and the implementation of third harmonic peaking Class-F amplifier. Based on this, an adaptive feedback group delay equalizer is proposed as a solution for the <b>phase</b> <b>error</b> <b>compensation</b> within the whole chirp signal swept bandwidth. A very simple but effective <b>phase</b> <b>error</b> detection and calculation circuit is designed, built and measured. The test branch results are very satisfying. Its small size and lower power consumption makes it very suitable for a compact microsatellite environment. In summary, the possibility of a medium resolution microsatellite borne radar altimeter for optimising shipping routes is investigated in this study. A 12 satellites constellation is proposed for achieving near real time altimetry broadcasting. The key payload design problems are identified in a thorough feasibility study: the restriction corresponding to these main problems is quantified via the SWH estimation simulation. A feedback linearization method is proposed as a promising solution for the compact microsatellite design with high power efficiency requirements, demonstrated by both simulation and hardware implementation results.

30|$|The {{approach}} we {{have described}} {{in the previous section}} looks for potential motion everywhere in the scene, e.g., it handles each point in the scene separately considering each point may potentially have a different motion. However, moving points usually exist together in limited regions of a scene. Let us consider a scene containing a few linearly moving vehicles. In this case, all the points belonging to a particular vehicle will have the same motion. In order to exploit such a structure both for computational gains and for improved robustness, we present a modified version of our method.

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} {{has become}} one of the most critical design challenges in integrated circuit design. Arithmetic computing circuits, in particular array-based arithmetic computing circuits such as adders, multipliers, squarers, have been widely used. In many cases, array-based arithmetic computing circuits consume a significant amount of energy in a chip design. Hence, reduction of energy consumption of array-based arithmetic computing circuits is an important design consideration. To this end, designing low-power arithmetic circuits by intelligently trading off processing precision for energy saving in error-resilient applications such as DSP, machine learning and neuromorphic circuits provides a promising solution to the energy dissipation challenge of such systems. To solve the chip?s energy problem, especially for those applications with inherent error resilience, array-based approximate arithmetic computing (AAAC) circuits that produce errors while having improved energy efficiency have been proposed. Specifically, a number of approximate adders, multipliers and squarers have been presented in the literature. However, the chief limitation of these designs is their un-optimized processing accuracy, which is largely due to the current lack of systemic guidance for array-based AAAC circuit design pertaining to optimal tradeoffs between error, energy and area overhead. Therefore, in this research, our first contribution is to propose a general model for approximate array-based approximate arithmetic computing to guide the minimization of processing error. As part of this model, the <b>Error</b> <b>Compensation</b> <b>Unit</b> (ECU) is identified as a key building block for a wide range of AAAC circuits. We develop theoretical analysis geared towards addressing two critical design problems of the ECU, namely, determination of optimal <b>error</b> <b>compensation</b> values and identification of the optimal <b>error</b> <b>compensation</b> scheme. We demonstrate how this general AAAC model can be leveraged to derive practical design insights that may lead to optimal tradeoffs between accuracy, energy dissipation and area overhead. To further minimize energy consumption, delay and area of AAAC circuits, we perform ECU logic simplification by introducing don't cares. By applying the proposed model, we propose an approximate 16 x 16 fixed-width Booth multiplier that consumes 44. 85 % and 28. 33 % less energy and area compared with theoretically the most accurate fixed-width Booth multiplier when implemented using a 90 nm CMOS standard cell library. Furthermore, it reduces average error, max error and mean square error by 11. 11 %, 28. 11 % and 25. 00 %, respectively, when compared with the best reported approximate Booth multiplier and outperforms the best reported approximate design significantly by 19. 10 % in terms of the energy-delay-mean square error product (EDE_(ms)). Using the same approach, significant energy consumption, area and error reduction is achieved for a squarer unit, with more than 20. 00 % EDE_(ms) reduction over existing fixed-width squarer designs.

In this paper it was investigated if the frequency response is able to correctly evaluate the ratio and the <b>phase</b> <b>errors</b> under distorted conditions. Two HECTs, with the accuracy class level of 1 % and 0. 5 % respectively, were experimentally characterized under two conditions: 1. sinusoidal excitation with frequencies from 50 to 750 Hz, which is the well known frequency response test; 2. nonsinusoidal excitation using fundamental frequency and one harmonic, with adjusted amplitude and phase shift. It was found that ratio and <b>phase</b> <b>errors</b> are weakly affected by the harmonic amplitude and phase shift respect to the fundamental in the accuracy level of 0. 1 % and 0. 05 deg.

These systems have been progressively more and more employedin many fields such as satellite communications, high data rate links (emerging 5 G technology), military and automotive radars. Initially they where only used for military applicationsdue to their higher costs and complexity. Thanks to the technology development and the researchers efforts, these days {{it is possible to}} integrate on the same chip an entire phased array system, leading to a drastic cost reduction. The explosive growth of the applications that use the phased array approach is the motivation behind this thesis, which deals with the analysis and design of high performance building blocks for phased array systems. The first part of this work gives a brief introduction on the phased array systems illustrating the working principle, the main tasks and issues of the design related to the need for high resolution and directivity of the antennas array. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to the analysis and design of building blocks for phased array systems. More in detail, the design of VGA (variable gain amplifier) and VCO (voltage controlled oscillator) will be described. VGAs are very important in the whole system because they are responsible for the array directivity and precision in the beam forming. The impact of the VGA performance impact on the phased array functionality is hence treated and analyzed. The phase behavior when the gain setting is changed is analyzed and discussed in depth. The aim of the design is to keep the phase of the signal constant for all the gain range variation in the frequency band of the amplifier. Several <b>phase</b> <b>error</b> <b>compensation</b> techniques have been studied and implemented. Some X -Band SiGe VGA have been realized and measured. The performance in terms of <b>phase</b> <b>error</b> as the gain is varied out-performs the state-of-the-art. In addition to X -Band applications, some work on the upcoming 5 G Communication Network has been done. A Wide Band (15 − 40 GHz) Variable Gain Amplifier has been prototyped in SiGe BiCMOS technology and a 28 GHz VGA has been implemented in a 40 nm CMOS Technology. The VCO is the other fundamental building block that we take into consideration in this thesis. In this case, we focus our attention on the phase noise, a crucial parameter that {{is directly related to the}} performance of the phased array system. An in-depth analysis on the minimization of the phase noise has been done and some K-band (i. e. 18 - 27 GHz) VCOs have been realized in a SiGe bipolar technology. The VCOs feature a phase noise as low as - 137 dBc/Hz at 10 MHz offset from the carrier. This result out-performs the state of the art if compared to other Silicon K-band Silicon-based VCOs. Only VCOs implemented using compound semiconductor technologies show better performance in terms of phase noise. However the technology cost is in this case, dramatically higher. The work shows the feasibility of realizing high performance building blocks for phase array systems in Silicon technology. The possibility to integrate an entire phased array system on the same chip leads to a drastic cost reduction, overcoming the barrier that has stopped the development of this approach for several applications for many years.

D. thesis {{advanced}} {{signal processing}} techniques are addressed {{in order to}} reconstruct high-resolution seafloor imagery using synthetic aperture sonar ground- range imaging. This enables applications such as object detection, hydrography, and pipeline inspection, among others. In particular, the problems of echo-data-driven motion estimation known as micronavigation, and <b>compensation</b> of <b>phase</b> <b>errors</b> are considered. Based on the developed processing chain, a sensitivity study is conducted that points out the impact of distorted seafloor imagery on an automatic detection and classification system for target recognition. Furthermore, the framework of compressive sensing is introduced for synthetic aperture imaging to attain higher coverage rates using along-track undersampling. Synthetic aperture techniques are advantageous over conventional real aperture imaging techniques as they achieve a range-independent resolution that enables the reconstruction of high-quality sonar imagery. However, this requires an accurate knowledge of the positions of the transmitter and the receiving elements for multiple consecutive transmission and reception times. As inertial navigation systems are imprecise in tracking translational platform motion, echo-data-driven motion estimation is additionally employed to estimate the platform trajectory. For this purpose, a motion estimation processing chain for real sonar measurements is designed in this thesis, which considers height information about the seafloor. To this end, a topography estimation technique, which takes into account a continuous roll movement of the imaging platform, is developed. In order to avoid image defocus in environments with a strongly varying topography in case of nonlinear trajectories, the obtained height estimates are used during image reconstruction. This leads to significant image quality improvements, which is demonstrated on synthetic data. A comparison of real synthetic aperture sonar images then highlights the quality enhancement using the developed processing chain. Furthermore, practical methods for an unbiased estimation of platform motion are proposed. These involve a compensation technique for correcting the occurrence of biased time delay estimates due to a high ratio of carrier frequency to bandwidth as well as a broadside beamforming method that equalizes the varying time delays due to near-field scenarios and widebeam systems. In order to avoid image defocusing in the presence of residual <b>phase</b> <b>errors,</b> modifications of an existing autofocus technique are proposed to better cope with spatially varying point spread functions in stripmap synthetic aperture imaging. Additionally, a data-driven calibration method is developed so as to correctly estimate an optimal average sound speed yielding the best focused imagery in situations of a spatially varying sound-speed profile. Although data-driven motion estimation and <b>phase</b> <b>error</b> <b>compensation</b> techniques aim at achieving high-quality imagery of the seafloor, investigating the influence of distorted sonar imagery on automatic target recognition systems is of utmost importance for future autonomous sonar systems in order to judge their reliability. A sensitivity study is conducted that demonstrates significant performance loss in image segmentation, feature quality as well as in classification performance of a specific automatic detection and classification system. Further, an empirical relation between image degradation and performance loss of the individual stages of the automatic detection and classification system is highlighted. In order to guarantee reliable inputs for automatic target recognition, a strategy is proposed to sequentially assess the image quality of synthetic aperture sonar imagery during reconstruction, which is based on the instantaneous cross-range resolution. Increasing the coverage rate of a synthetic aperture system in the case of conventional imaging techniques is only feasible by increasing the physical array size. Alternatively, a compressive sensing framework is applied to perform aperture undersampling and, thus, offer a higher platform speed while still maintaining imaging performance. A stripmap imaging technique is developed to avoid the occurrence of azimuth image ambiguities. Synthetic data simulations then demonstrate the huge potential in data reduction, and laboratory experiments using compressive sensing further show an increase in platform speed by a factor of two. This possibly reduces the overall mission time of future synthetic aperture systems in real-life scenarios. All developed methods are applied to synthetic data as well as to real sonar measurements...|$|R
