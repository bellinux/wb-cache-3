40|$|California {{agricultural}} irrigation consumes {{more than}} ten billion kilowatt hours of electricity annually and has significant potential for contributing to a reduction of stress on the grid through demand response, <b>permanent</b> <b>load</b> shifting, and energy efficiency measures. To understand this potential, a scoping study was initiated {{for the purpose of}} determining the associated opportunities, potential, and adoption challenges in California agricultural irrigation. The primary research for this study was conducted in two ways. First, data was gathered and parsed from published sources that shed light on where the best opportunities for load shifting and demand response lie within the agricultural irrigation sector. Secondly, a small limited survey was conducted as informal face-to-face interviews with several different California growers {{to get an idea of}} their ability and willingness to participate in <b>permanent</b> <b>load</b> shifting and/or demand response programs. Analysis of the data obtained from published sources and the survey reveal demand response and <b>permanent</b> <b>load</b> shifting opportunities by growing region, irrigation source, irrigation method, grower size, and utility coverage. The study examines some solutions for demand response and <b>permanent</b> <b>load</b> shifting in agricultural irrigation, which include adequate irrigation system capacity, automatic controls, variable frequency drives, and the contribution from energy efficiency measures. The study further examines the potential and challenges for grower acceptance of demand response and <b>permanent</b> <b>load</b> shifting in California agricultural irrigation.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} proved for bridges that the collaboration between a deck structure and an external pre-stressed cable {{is a very}} advantageous structural system {{due to the fact}} that the use of external pre-stressing cables neutralizes the <b>permanent</b> <b>loads.</b> However, the action of the moving loads on the cables causes large displacements not compatible with the connected deck structure. A successful method to minimize the aforementioned undesirable displacements is to use a passive control system based on an a priori upward, vertical deformation of the deck due to the pre-stress action of the supported cables.

40|$|In {{the present}} dissertation, {{displacement}} control systems for large span structures using cablenets are herein proposed. The system {{is based on}} cable supported beam nets with additional prestressing control of the support cables such as to optimize the structural behavior of the system: the passive control design problem leads to an optimal control problem for structures governed by variational inequalities. The optimal shape of a prestressing support cable in many cases leads to a Form-Finding problem of the structure. The analysis {{is based on the}} two-nodes-curved-cable-element where large displacements and large rotations occur. Therefore, a multi-span cable is a non-linear and flexible structure since every loading case defines a new equilibrium configuration for the system. Using a prestressing strategy, the configuration of the cable structure due to the <b>permanent</b> <b>loading</b> is final. The novel passive control system is based on prestressing cables mechanism where <b>permanent</b> <b>loads</b> are relieved by a first level prestressing cables set named (a) and moving loads together with excessive displacements are taken by an additional cablenet (b) depending on the form {{and the use of the}} structure. Several variations of these passive control systems using prestressing cables are herein proposed: 1) A combination of a horizontal straight beams and external prestressing supported cable connecting with vertical rods where sliding contacts occur between rods and the cable. 2) A set of cables named (β) is used. This set has the same form with the cables of set (α), they also fastened at the same points while freely sliding bearings are used as connection joints with the vertical rods of the structure. The peculiarity of the cables of the latter set in that they are not homogenous. They are composed of n number of initially prestressed rods surrounded with the cracked unilateral stiffness rod elements with different initial prestresses at each face of the polygonal line. The prestressed cable elements are connected with nonprestressed of small length cable elements of the same set (β), where are not activated during <b>permanent</b> <b>loading</b> because of the set (α) supported cables, but is only activated under the moving loading action. 3) A prestress strategy when set (α) cables supported a horizontal straight beam structure, such as the reactions of the cable at the sliding contacts with the vertical rods due to prestress are bigger than the action forces of the <b>permanent</b> <b>loading</b> at the upper side of the same vertical rods. The result of this strategy is a new equilibrium configuration of the beam structure in opposite direction of the moving loading action. 4) The unilateral Form-Finding of arch beam structures using cable configuration due to the nodal <b>permanent</b> <b>loading,</b> but with negative shape form. 5) Introduction of diagonal cable element with no contact at the middle of their length, to connect nodes of the upper beam structure and the corresponding (in diagonal direction) node of the set (α) cable. The diagonal cables are not prestressed, but in the case of moving loading action the one them is stretched and the other has no action due to no press occur in cable elements. 6) The use of small displacements at the moving end of beam or arch structure supported with set (α) cable, due to moving loading action. 7) In floating bodies model, the compulsion overtopping of natural waterline of the body by the use of stable anchorage to the bottom by four prestressed cable (or chain) elements. 8) A combination between several of the above systems to the same model. The proposed models for large space structures with several passive systems on it, such as the above eight cases, aim with the purpose to minimize the effects of moving loading action. In any case the proposed model has been fully numerically examined, by the use (2 -D) or (3 -D) linear and non-linear finite element models. Many examples of them are bridge structures with several free length spans and with different passive control systems of displacements against moving loads according DIN 1072 & Eurocode- 1. In the case of (3 -D) models some of the examples have been checked successfully with wind loading models. Additionally checks with excellent results gave the basic examples for bridge structures against seismic action with dynamic spectra analysis according Greek National Rules. The study presents new techniques for the design and construction of large span structures (such as bridges, long cover structures and as an extension of the passive prestress control method using cables and applications on floating bodies and structures). The scope of this work is to develop new models of large space structures where unilateral conditions occur minimizing moments action and respectively the necessary sections of the structural members. These type of structure minimize the seismic action on the bridge. The proposed models of large span structures lead to a safer and more economical method of construction with small disturbance to the natural environment. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanical}} design {{of trees and}} wood is suited to face two types of mechanical loads: <b>permanent</b> <b>loads</b> related {{to the increase in}} self-weight, and temporary loads due to external actions such as wind. In angiosperms, a tensile longitudinal stress is always generated around the tree periphery during wood formation. This maturation stress {{plays a key role in}} terms of biomechanical adaptation of the tree to its environment: it provides the stem with a motor system allowing the postural control of the tree (i. e. compensating for the effect of <b>permanent</b> <b>loads)</b> and, eventually, the reorientation of stems and branches in response to disturbance. Another important function of this tensile pre-stress located at the periphery is to improve the bending resistance of stems against temporary loads, by compensating for the relatively low compressive strength of green wood. As consequence of maturation stress production, compressive growth stress accumulates in the core of the trunk. A numerical model was formulated and implemented to compute the field of longitudinal growth stress across a growing cross-section, and to calculate ecologically relevant parameters defined as the "performance of the motor system" and the "safety against temporary bending". The model is general enough to account for any cross-section shape, growth eccentricity, viscoelastic behavior of wood and heterogeneity of wood mechanical properties (stiffness and maturation stress). Simulations were performed to evaluate the influence of these parameters on the growth stress pattern, motor performance, and safety against temporary bending. Results show that in some situations, the growth stress pattern can have a negative impact on the bending safety. A sensitivity analysis was performed and evidences that, in some case, the motor performance can be only improved at the expense of a lower safety against bending loads. Conclusions emphasize the fact that the value of biomechanical parameters mediates a trade-off between the motor performance of the stem and its safety against temporary loads, and that the range of real value of biomechanical parameters is close to optimal regarding this trade-off...|$|R
