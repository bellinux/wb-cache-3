5|$|Although {{cyclones}} take {{an enormous}} toll in lives and personal property, {{they may be}} important factors in the precipitation regimes of <b>places</b> <b>they</b> affect and bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions. Hurricanes in the eastern north Pacific often supply moisture to the Southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. Japan receives over half of its rainfall from typhoons. Hurricane Camille averted drought conditions and ended water deficits along much of its path, though it also killed 259people and caused $9.14billion (2005 USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on 26 June 1922, Asama resumed making {{training}} cruises, {{usually at}} two-year intervals, that {{took her to}} Australia, Southeast Asia, and the Mediterranean Sea among other <b>places.</b> <b>They</b> {{came to an end}} after she ran aground on the night of 13 October 1935 north north-west of the Kurushima Strait in the Inland Sea. Her bottom was badly damaged and she was deemed no longer seaworthy after repairs were completed at Kure Naval Arsenal. The ship was then assigned as a stationary training ship for the Kure Naval Corps on 5 July 1938.|$|E

McCall released 13players from his squad and {{replaced them with}} a number of signings with experience in a higher division, as well as Michael Boulding, who was one of League Two's top goalscorers during the 2007–08 campaign. McCall's side made a good start to the season, and after winning five of their opening six league games, went top of the league – the first time City had led the table in seven years.|$|E
5|$|In some cultures, insects, {{especially}} deep-fried cicadas, {{are considered}} to be delicacies, whereas in other <b>places</b> <b>they</b> form part of the normal diet. Insects have a high protein content for their mass, and some authors suggest their potential as a major source of protein in human nutrition. In most first-world countries, however, entomophagy (the eating of insects), is taboo.|$|E

5|$|Sonic Colors is a 2010 {{platform}} {{video game}} published by Sega. An installment in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, the story follows Sonic's quest {{to stop his}} nemesis Doctor Eggman from enslaving an alien race and taking over the world. The gameplay is similar to prior entries in the series, with players collecting rings and defeating enemies. During gameplay, the camera perspective switches from third-person to side-scrolling perspectives. The game also introduces power-ups called Wisps, which the player can use to increase attack power and reach <b>places</b> <b>they</b> cannot otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} the {{soldiers}} at Stillman's Run were originally buried in a common grave, but who buried them remains an open question. A memorial, erected in 1901, stands near their marked graves. The monument and battle site are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic <b>Places.</b> <b>They</b> are near Illinois Route 72 a block west of present-day Stillman Creek.|$|E
5|$|Tropical cyclones, {{a source}} of very heavy rainfall, consist of large air masses several hundred miles across with low {{pressure}} at the centre and with winds blowing inward towards the centre in either a clockwise direction (southern hemisphere) or counter clockwise (northern hemisphere). Although cyclones can take an enormous toll in lives and personal property, they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of <b>places</b> <b>they</b> impact, as they may bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions. Areas in their path can receive a year's worth of rainfall from a tropical cyclone passage.|$|E

5|$|Although {{they failed}} to achieve their objectives, by nightfall the ANZACs had formed a beachhead, albeit much smaller than intended. In <b>places</b> <b>they</b> were {{clinging}} onto cliff faces with no organised defence system. Their precarious position convinced both divisional commanders to ask for an evacuation, but after taking advice from the Royal Navy about how practicable that would be, the army commander decided they would stay. The exact number of the day's casualties is not known. The ANZACs had landed two divisions but over two thousand of their men had been killed or wounded, together {{with at least a}} similar number of Turkish casualties.|$|E
5|$|Among extant strepsirrhines, {{only the}} diurnal and cathemeral lemurs {{have evolved to}} live in multi-male/multi-female groups, {{comparable}} to most living simians. This social trait, seen in two extant lemur families (Indriidae and Lemuridae), {{is thought to have}} evolved independently. Group sizes are smaller in social lemurs than in simians, and despite the similarities, the community structures differ. Female dominance, which is rare in simians, is fairly common in lemurs. Strepsirrhines spend a considerable amount of time grooming each other (allogrooming). When lemuriform primates groom, they lick the fur and then comb it with their toothcomb. They also use their grooming claw to scratch <b>places</b> <b>they</b> cannot reach with their mouth.|$|E

5|$|Any German {{invasion}} of Britain {{would have to}} involve the landing of troops and equipment somewhere on the coast, and the most vulnerable areas were {{the south and east}} coasts of England. Here, Emergency Coastal Batteries were constructed to protect ports and likely landing <b>places.</b> <b>They</b> were fitted with whatever guns were available, which mainly came from naval vessels scrapped {{since the end of the}} First World War. These included 6inch (152mm), 5.5inch (140mm), 4.7inch (120mm) and 4inch (102mm) guns. These had little ammunition, sometimes as few as ten rounds apiece. At Dover, two 14inch (356mm) guns known as Winnie and Pooh were employed. There were also a few land based torpedo launching sites.|$|E
5|$|Before Æthelberht's {{death in}} 616 {{a number of}} other bishoprics had been {{established}} but after that date, a pagan backlash set in and the see, or bishopric, of London was abandoned. Æthelberht's daughter, Æthelburg, married Edwin, the king of the Northumbrians, and by 627 Paulinus, the bishop who accompanied her north, had converted Edwin and {{a number of other}} Northumbrians. When Edwin died, in about 633, his widow and Paulinus were forced to flee to Kent. Although the missionaries could not remain in all of the <b>places</b> <b>they</b> had evangelised, by the time the last of them died in 653, they had established Christianity in Kent and the surrounding countryside and contributed a Roman tradition to the practice of Christianity in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{locations}} in Juniata County are {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic <b>Places.</b> <b>They</b> were listed between 1972 and 1986. They include the Academia Pomeroy Covered Bridge, the Tuscarora Academy, and the Book Site in Beale Township; the Lehmans-Port Royal Bridge in Milford Township; and the East Oriental and North Oriental covered bridges. The Dimmsville Covered Bridge in Greenwood Township had been designated as a historic place, but fell into disrepair and collapsed in April, 2017. Eight additional places are eligible for a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. There are five Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission historical markers in Juniata County. They commemorate the Tuscarora Path, the Tuscarora Academy, Patterson's Fort, Fort Bingham, and Juniata County itself.|$|E

5|$|Poison dart frog (also {{known as}} dart-poison frog, poison frog or {{formerly}} known as poison arrow frog) is the common name {{of a group of}} frogs in the family Dendrobatidae which are native to tropical Central and South America. These species are diurnal and often have brightly colored bodies. This bright coloration is correlated with the toxicity of the species, making them aposematic. Some species of the family Dendrobatidae exhibit extremely bright coloration along with high toxicity, while others have cryptic coloration with minimal to no amount of observed toxicity. The species that have great toxicity derive this from their diet of ants, mites and termites. Other species however, that exhibit cryptic coloration and low to no amounts of toxicity, eat a much larger variety of prey. Many species of this family are threatened due to human infrastructure encroaching the <b>places</b> <b>they</b> inhabit.|$|E
5|$|Private Ambulance Service – Normal {{commercial}} {{companies with}} paid employees, but often on contract {{to the local}} or national government. Private companies may provide only the patient transport elements of ambulance care (i.e. nonurgent or ambulatory transport), but in some <b>places,</b> <b>they</b> are contracted to provide emergency care, or to form a 'second tier' response. In many areas private services cover all emergency transport functions and government agencies do not provide this service. Companies such as Falck, Acadian Ambulance, and American Medical Response {{are some of the}} larger companies that provide such services. These organisations may also provide services known as 'Stand-by' cover at industrial sites or at special events. From April 2011 all private ambulance services in the UK must be Care Quality Commission (CQC) registered. Private services in Canada operate non-emergency patient transfers or for private functions only.|$|E
5|$|Special {{behavioral}} {{features of}} the dromedary include snapping at others without biting them and showing displeasure by stamping their feet. They are generally non-aggressive, {{with the exception of}} rutting males. They appear to remember their homes; females in particular remember the <b>places</b> <b>they</b> first gave birth or suckled their offspring. Males become aggressive in the mating season, and sometimes wrestle. A 1980 study showed androgen levels in males influences their behaviour. Between January and April when these levels are high during the rut, they become difficult to manage, blow out the palate from the mouth, vocalise and throw urine over their backs. Camels scratch parts of their bodies with their legs or with their lower incisors. They may also rub against tree bark and roll in sand.|$|E
