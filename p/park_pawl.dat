50|$|The <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> {{locks the}} {{transmission}}'s output shaft to the transmission casing by engaging a pawl (a pin) that engages in a notched wheel on the shaft, stopping it (and thus the driven wheels) from rotating. The main {{components of a}} <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> mechanism are the <b>parking</b> gear, <b>parking</b> <b>pawl,</b> actuator rod, cam collar, cam plate, pivot pin and <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> return spring. The mechanism assembly is designed so that the <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> tooth collides and overrides the parking gear teeth (ratchets) until a safe engagement speed for the vehicle is reached. Software controls are {{put in place to}} avoid this condition and engage the pawl only when the vehicle has come to a stand still.|$|R
50|$|The <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> in a {{traditional}} automatic transmission has a mechanical link to the gear lever and locks the transmission in the park position when the vehicle is set in Park. Not {{to be confused with}} the parking brake. A park by wire system uses electronic commands to actuate the <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> by a motor when the driver puts the vehicle in park.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} TorqueFlite {{was designated}} A488, with a cast iron case, separate iron converter housing, and no <b>parking</b> <b>pawl.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{is highly}} inadvisable {{to use the}} <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> to stop a vehicle in motion. Modern <b>parking</b> <b>pawls</b> are {{connected}} to a safety mechanism that prevents the pawl from engaging unless the vehicle is stopped first. The pawl mechanism is generally {{not strong enough to}} stop a vehicle in motion, if it engages at all. Under that much stress, the pawl may simply break off in the transmission, leading to costly repairs.|$|R
5000|$|Most vehicle {{manufacturers}} and auto mechanics do not recommend using the transmission's <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> {{as the sole}} means of securing a parked vehicle, instead recommending it should only be engaged after first applying the vehicle's parking brake. Constant use of only the <b>parking</b> <b>pawl,</b> especially when <b>parking</b> on a steep incline, means that driveline components, and transmission internals, are kept constantly under stress, and can cause wear and eventual failure of the <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> or transmission linkage. The pawl might also fail or break if the vehicle is pushed with sufficient force, if the parking brake is not firmly engaged. Replacement can be an expensive operation since it not only requires removing the transmission from the vehicle, but it's usually the first component to be installed in the gearbox case during a complete rebuild.|$|R

50|$|A park by wire system {{engages the}} <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> of a {{transmission}} using electrical means. This {{can also be}} considered as part of a shift by wire system whose objective is to put the vehicle in Park, Reverse, Neutral and Drive modes without the traditional mechanical system which involves linkages between the gear shifter and the transmission. The main components of a park by wire system include the driver interface which could be a lever, switch or knob as designed by the OEM (input), an electronic control unit to host the control system and actuators (one or two motors) which are capable of driving the <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> {{into and out of the}} locking position with the parking gear of the transmission.|$|R
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{use for a}} parking brake is to keep a vehicle {{motionless}} when it is parked. The park brake has a ratchet or other locking mechanism that will keep it engaged until manually released. On vehicles with automatic transmissions, this is usually used in concert with a <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> in the transmission.|$|R

5000|$|Even {{though the}} motor may be {{permanently}} {{connected to the}} wheels through a fixed-ratio gear and no <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> may be present the modes [...] "P" [...] and [...] "N" [...] will still be provided on the selector. In this case the motor is disabled in [...] "N" [...] and an electrically actuated hand brake provides the [...] "P" [...] mode.|$|R
50|$|A <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> is {{a device}} fitted to a motor vehicle's {{automatic}} transmission {{in order for}} it to lock up the transmission. It is engaged when the transmission shift lever selector {{is placed in the}} Park position, which is always the first position (topmost on a column shift, frontmost on a floor shift) in all cars sold in the United States since 1965 (when the order was standardised by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)) through SAE J915, and in most other vehicles worldwide.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{use for a}} parking brake is to keep a vehicle {{motionless}} when it is parked. Parking brakes have a ratchet locking mechanism that will keep them engaged until a release button is pressed. On vehicles with automatic transmissions, this is usually used in concert with a <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> in the transmission. In vehicles with manual transmission the hand brake is also routinely used to assist in hill starts as this frees both feet for use on the accelerator and clutch pedals. A skilled motorist should {{always be able to}} get the car moving without rolling back at all.|$|R
50|$|The {{most popular}} form found in {{automobiles}} is the hydraulic automatic transmission. Similar but larger devices {{are also used}} for heavy-duty commercial and industrial vehicles and equipment. This system uses a fluid coupling {{in place of a}} friction clutch, and accomplishes gear changes by hydraulically locking and unlocking a system of planetary gears. These systems have a defined set of gear ranges, often with a <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> that locks the output shaft of the transmission to keep the vehicle from rolling either forward or backward. Some machines with limited speed ranges or fixed engine speeds, such as some forklifts and lawn mowers, only use a torque converter to provide a variable gearing of the engine to the wheels.|$|R
50|$|The HydraMatic was {{designed}} to combine hydraulic operation of a planetary gearbox (allowing much shifting to be automated) with a fluid coupling instead of a friction clutch, {{eliminating the need for}} de-clutching. The transmission would have four forward speeds (3.82:1, 2.63:1, 1.45:1, and 1.00:1) plus reverse, with all acceleration provided by gearing; its fluid coupling did not multiply the engine output as a torque converter does. (In this way, it was less sophisticated than the 1924 Vulcan (Vulcan-Werke Hamburg und Stettin) prototype, which had a torque converter.) It incorporated a <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> which was engaged when the shift selector was placed in reverse with the engine off. There was no separate Park position as found with modern transmissions.|$|R
50|$|The single {{circumstance}} {{under which}} a Teletouch {{could be put}} into gear with the car moving at greater than three to five miles per hour was if the neutral button was depressed first, thereby removing hydraulic pressure from the inhibitor switch, and then the reverse or park button pushed. These actions would, as a result, either shear off the <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> or suddenly set the rear wheels turning in the reverse direction, effectively locking them up against the road surface and possibly damaging the reverse bands in the transmission. Ironically, the failed Autolite Packard system protected against this set of circumstances by locking out not only reverse and park, but also neutral while the car was moving with any significant speed.|$|R
5000|$|A car {{should be}} allowed to come to a {{complete}} stop before setting the transmission into park to prevent damage. Usually, Park (P) is one of only two selections in which the car's engine can be started, the other being Neutral (N). This is typically achieved via a normally open inhibitor switch (sometimes called a [...] "neutral safety switch") wired in series with the starter motor engagement circuit, which is closed when P or N is selected, completing the circuit (when the key is turned to the start position). In many modern cars and trucks, the driver must have the foot brake applied before the transmission can be taken out of park. The Park position is omitted on buses/coaches (and some road tractors) with automatic transmission (on which a <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> is not practical), which must instead be placed in neutral with the air-operated parking brakes set.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "park-to-reverse" [...] {{situation}} {{involves a}} driver {{who believes that}} they have shifted into [...] "park" [...] and believing so, and the vehicle not moving when they pull their foot off the brake, proceeds to exit the vehicle. There can then be a delay in vehicle movement sufficient for the driver to either fully or partially exit the vehicle before the vehicle moves. Typically, the vehicle will move backwards. However, when on certain vehicles the shift selector can be placed between the detented park and reverse gear positions; i.e. in [...] "false park" [...] the transmission is in hydraulic neutral, without the <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> engaged. As such the vehicle can also roll either forward or back in neutral. While less common, transmissions with the defect, can also be shifted to between [...] "neutral" [...] and [...] "drive", and then self shift into [...] "drive" [...] or roll (called a [...] "neutral to drive" [...] accident).|$|R
5000|$|The A488 was {{replaced}} in 1962 with the A727 (later renamed 36RH and 37RH), with a one-piece aluminum case to reduce weight by about 60 lb. This was initially {{referred to in}} consumer-oriented publications as the [...] "TorqueFlite 8" [...] to differentiate it from the A904. The A727 incorporated a <b>parking</b> <b>pawl,</b> with the sole exception of the 1962 Chrysler version, which had an extension-mounted drum brake. Compared to the early cast-iron transmissions, many and various internal improvements were featured, and it used a 10.75 in or 11.75 in torque converter. The heavier-duty A727 Torqueflites became — and remain — wildly popular for drag racing, off roading, and monster truck applications because of their controllability, reliability, ease/cheapness of repair and brute strength. Note there are unique bellhousing bolt patterns for the small block [...] "A" [...] and big block [...] "B" [...] engine versions of this transmission, and for the AMC/Jeep applications.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{issues such}} as locking and/or {{breaking}} the parking [...] "pawl" [...] occurs in these transmissions primarily due to owner negligence in not operating the parking brake properly, or not using the parking brake at all. If the vehicle is allowed to [...] "roll back" [...] onto the pawl with heavy force (such as when parking on a steep incline), the pawl may break off or seize the gears so that either the vehicle rolls away, or when the owner starts the vehicle and attempts to put the vehicle in gear, {{they are unable to}} move the shift lever from Park. This creates a compound issue in which the shifter linkage or cable can break due to excess force. The vehicle's owner guide states the appropriate procedure is to engage the parking brake before shifting to Park, rather than relying on the pawl, as the pawl is a last line of defense to prevent the vehicle from moving unintentionally. If the <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> breaks off or bends, serious transaxle damage can occur.|$|R
50|$|From 1939-1950, {{the reverse}} anchor {{was used to}} lock the reverse unit ring gear from turning by {{engaging}} external teeth machined into that ring gear. From 1951 on, a cone clutch {{did the same thing}} when oil pressure was up, and a spring-loaded <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> was allowed to lock the same ring gear in the absence of oil pressure. This worked better as the anchor would not grind on the external teeth if that ring gear were turning (that is, unless the engine stalled as reverse was engaged). Reverse was obtained by applying torque from the front unit (band on, in reduction) through the fluid coupling to the rear unit sun gear. The planet carrier of this gearset was splined to the planet carrier of the reverse unit. The rear unit ring gear hub had a small gear machined on its end which served as the reverse unit sun gear. Because the rear unit band was not applied for reverse, the rear unit and reverse unit compounded causing the combined planet carriers to rotate opposite to the input torque and at a further reduced speed. The output shaft was machined onto the rear unit and reverse unit planet carriers.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{very closely}} {{resembling}} the American transmissions, GAZ's copies did have distinctive differences. First of all - their components were adopted to the metric units. Their gear ratios - to the car's engines. Both cars' handbrake actuated a central drum between the housing and the drive shaft, {{instead of the}} rear wheels. Thus a <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> was deemed redundant. Volga's transmission, based on the Fordomatic, required additional adaptation to the air-cooled torque converter, as it was driven by a 65 hp 4 cylinder engine. Controlled by a steering column mounted lever, it had four regimes: Зх-Н-Д-П (R-N-D-L). In Drive the car would start in second and automatically shift to third depending on throttle position (the valve was regulated by a lever linked to the accelerator pedal). A kick-down feature was also present. First gear could only be engaged manually in Low (though it could be engaged if the car was in motion, but would only donwshift) and was used for engine braking or rapid starts. Gear ratios were: 2.4 - 1.0 for the torque converter, 2.84 for first gear, 1.68 for second, third was direct and reverse was 1.72.|$|R
50|$|Park (P): This {{selection}} mechanically {{locks the}} output shaft of transmission, restricting the vehicle from moving in any direction. A <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> prevents the transmission from rotating, {{and therefore the}} vehicle from moving. However, the vehicle's non-driven wheels are still free to rotate, and the driven wheels may still rotate individually (because of the differential). For this reason, it is recommended to use the hand brake (parking brake) because this actually locks (in most cases) the wheels and prevents them from moving. It is typical of front-wheel-drive vehicles for the parking brake to lock the rear (non-driving) wheels, so use of both the parking brake and the transmission park lock provides the greatest security against unintended movement on slopes. This also increases {{the life of the}} transmission and the park pin mechanism, because parking on an incline with the transmission in park without the parking brake engaged will cause undue stress on the parking pin, and may even prevent the pin from releasing. A hand brake should also prevent the car from moving if a worn selector accidentally drops into reverse gear while idling.|$|R
50|$|Efforts {{of local}} {{business}} leaders to promote development were rewarded in 2005, with a $2.4 million grant and low-interest loan package to develop <b>Pawling</b> Station Business <b>Park.</b> It is a 48 acre site along Route 522 in Penn Township, that will feature three to 6 acre lots with storm water drainage. An 18-member volunteer task force will oversee {{the construction of}} <b>Pawling</b> <b>Park.</b> The task force includes Pennsylvania Senator John Gordner and Rep Russ Fairchild, community leaders {{with a wide range}} of economic development experience and skills including an accountant, lawyer, land developer, engineer, surveyor, and two bankers - along with chairmen of the Snyder County Board of Commissioners, Penn Township Board of Supervisors, and Township Municipal Authority.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{automatic}} transmission using hydraulic fluid {{was developed in}} 1932 by two Brazilian engineers, José Braz Araripe and Fernando Lehly Lemos; Later, the prototype and the project were sold to General Motors, who introduced the technology in the 1940 Oldsmobile model as a [...] "Hydra-Matic" [...] transmission. However, an article published by the Wall Street Journal credits the German auto parts company ZF Friedrichshafen for the invention, which would have occurred shortly after World War I. In 1934, both REO and General Motors developed semi-{{automatic transmission}}s that were less difficult to operate than a fully manual unit. These designs, however, continued to use a clutch to engage the engine with the transmission. The General Motors unit, dubbed the [...] "Automatic Safety Transmission," [...] was notable in that it employed a power-shifting planetary gearbox that was hydraulically controlled and was sensitive to road speed, anticipating future development. Parallel to the development in the 1930s of an automatically shifting gearbox was Chrysler's work on adapting the fluid coupling to automotive use. Invented early in the 20th century, the fluid coupling was {{the answer to the}} question of how to avoid stalling the engine when the vehicle was stopped with the transmission in gear. Chrysler itself never used the fluid coupling with any of its automatic transmissions, but did use it in conjunction with a hybrid manual transmission called [...] "Fluid Drive" [...] (the similar Hy-Drive used a torque converter). These developments in automatic gearbox and fluid coupling technology eventually culminated in the introduction in 1939 of the General Motors Hydra-Matic, the world's first mass-produced automatic transmission. Available as an option on 1940 Oldsmobiles and later Cadillacs, the Hydra-Matic combined a fluid coupling with three hydraulically controlled planetary gearsets to produce four forward speeds plus reverse. The transmission was sensitive to engine throttle position and road speed, producing fully automatic up- and down-shifting that varied according to operating conditions. The Hydra-Matic was subsequently adopted by Cadillac and Pontiac, and was sold to various other automakers, including Bentley, Hudson, Kaiser, Nash, and Rolls-Royce. It also found use during World War II in some military vehicles. From 1950 to 1954, Lincoln cars were also available with the Hydra-Matic. Mercedes-Benz subsequently devised a four-speed fluid coupling transmission that was similar in principle to the Hydra-Matic, but of a different design. Interestingly, the original Hydra-Matic incorporated two features which are widely emulated in today's transmissions. The Hydra-Matic's ratio spread through the four gears produced excellent [...] "step-off" [...] and acceleration in first, good spacing of intermediate gears, and the effect of an overdrive in fourth, by virtue of the low numerical rear axle ratio used in the vehicles of the time. In addition, in third and fourth gear, the fluid coupling only handled a portion of the engine's torque, resulting in a high degree of efficiency. In this respect, the transmission's behavior was similar to modern units incorporating a lock-up torque converter. In 1956, GM introduced the [...] "Jetaway" [...] Hydra-Matic, which was different in design than the older model. Addressing the issue of shift quality, which was an ongoing problem with the original Hydra-Matic, the new transmission utilized two fluid couplings, the primary one that linked the transmission to the engine, and a secondary one that replaced the clutch assembly that controlled the forward gearset in the original. The result was much smoother shifting, especially from first to second gear, but with a loss in efficiency and an increase in complexity. Another innovation for this new style Hydra-Matic was the appearance of a Park position on the selector. The original Hydra-Matic, which continued in production until the mid-1960s, still used the reverse position for <b>parking</b> <b>pawl</b> engagement. The first torque converter automatic, Buick's Dynaflow, was introduced for the 1948 model year. It was followed by Packard's Ultramatic in mid-1949 and Chevrolet's Powerglide for the 1950 model year. Each of these transmissions had only two forward speeds, relying on the converter for additional torque multiplication. In the early 1950s, BorgWarner developed a series of three-speed torque converter automatics for American Motors, Ford Motor Company, Studebaker, and several other manufacturers in the US and other countries. Chrysler was late in developing its own true automatic, introducing the two-speed torque converter PowerFlite in 1953, and the three-speed TorqueFlite in 1956. The latter was the first to utilize the Simpson compound planetary gearset. General Motors produced multiple-turbine torque converters from 1954 to 1961. These included the Twin-Turbine Dynaflow and the triple-turbine Turboglide transmissions. The shifting took place in the torque converter, rather than through pressure valves and changes in planetary gear connections. Each turbine was connected to the drive shaft through a different gear train. These phased from one ratio to another according to demand, rather than shifting. The Turboglide actually had two speed ratios in reverse, with one of the turbines rotating backwards. By the late 1960s, most of the fluid-coupling four-speed and two-speed transmissions had disappeared in favor of three-speed units with torque converters. Also around this time, whale oil was removed from automatic transmission fluid. By the early 1980s, these were being supplemented and eventually replaced by overdrive-equipped transmissions providing four or more forward speeds. Many transmissions also adopted the lock-up torque converter (a mechanical clutch locking the torque converter pump and turbine together to eliminate slip at cruising speed) to improve fuel economy. As computerized engine control units (ECUs) became more capable, much of the logic built into the transmission's valve body was offloaded to the ECU. Some manufacturers use a separate computer dedicated to the transmission called a transmission control unit (TCU), also known as the transmission control module (TCM), which shares information with the engine management computer. In this case, solenoids turned on and off by the computer control shift patterns and gear ratios, rather than the spring-loaded valves in the valve body. This allows for more precise control of shift points, shift quality, lower shift times, and (on some newer cars) semi-automatic control, where the driver tells the computer when to shift. The result is an impressive combination of efficiency and smoothness. Some computers even identify the driver's style and adapt to best suit it.|$|R
