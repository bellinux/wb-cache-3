5|$|Poliomyelitis, {{often called}} polio or {{infantile}} paralysis, is an infectious disease {{caused by the}} poliovirus. In about 0.5 percent of cases there is muscle weakness resulting in an inability to move. This can occur over {{a few hours to}} a few days. The weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head, neck and diaphragm. Many but not all people fully recover. In those with muscle weakness about 2 to 5 percent of children and 15 to 30 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>adults</b> die. Another 25 percent of people have minor symptoms such as fever and a sore throat and up to 5 percent have headache, neck stiffness and pains in the arms and legs. These people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks. In up to 70 percent of infections there are no symptoms. Years after recovery post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to that which the person had during the initial infection.|$|E

Many children become infected with EBV, and these infections usually cause no symptoms or are indistinguishable from the other mild, brief illnesses of childhood.

40|$|Aims: To analyse spatial {{patterns}} {{in the distribution of}} major communicable diseases in West Khasi Hills District. Study Design: Random sampling technique has been used to collect household data. It has been purpossively selected 28 villages. The criteria selecting this villges are that they are close to the uranium mining site. Around 719 households from these 28 villages were covered for the present study. Data collected from households have been analysed for each village separately. Data are calculated in excel and for frequencies are used in SPSS software. Separate layers of data have been mapped for each of the demographic parameters for which the household information has been collected through a structured household schedule canvassed through an interview method. Mapping technique has been employed on a GIS platform to get a comprehensive demographic picture of each of the sample villages in each of the distance zone. Place and Duration of Study: West Khasi Hills District, Meghalaya, N. E. India between 2009 and 2011. Methodology: Data for the present researchhas been collected from a number of villages located around Domiasiat village which is the locus of the proposed uranium mining. The health conditions and the disease prevalence in the area around this village have been assessed by collecting useful information from households in 28 villages {{selected on the basis of}} distance criterion. Results: A study of the morbidity pattern reveals the dominance of communicable diseases as reported by the respondents. The types of sicknesses recorded during the survey shows that the most prevalent type of sickness is malaria that afflicted more than 45. 27 percent adult males, 41. 20 percent adult females, and 33. 18 <b>percent</b> children <b>of</b> the population interviewed.

Elsewhere, adults, as reported in newspapers from the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s, typically saw it as a form of extortion, with reactions ranging from bemused indulgence to anger. Likewise, as portrayed on radio shows, children would have to explain what trick-or-treating was to puzzled adults, and not the other way around.
