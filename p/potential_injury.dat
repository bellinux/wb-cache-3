5|$|Larger clubs became {{interested}} in buying him {{during the summer of}} 2002 and he decided to consider his options before deciding on his future. He trialled with Everton in May 2002, and played in a friendly against Falkirk in the Alex Scott Memorial Trophy, keeping a clean sheet. He revealed he was interested in a move to Everton, and due to Fettis' good form for York, he decided to pursue a move. After his contract expired on 30 June 2002, Howarth joined Wolves for a second trial in July for a two-week period. After playing in Wolves' opening pre-season friendly against Morecambe, he was invited to join them for their pre-season tour of Portugal. Despite being out of contract at York, the club was entitled a fee as he was under 24 years of age, but a bid of £60,000 from Wolves was rejected. He was recalled by York {{to take part in a}} pre-season friendly against Sunderland, although he refused to participate. Howarth told Dolan he did not want to play for the club, as any <b>potential</b> <b>injury</b> could have ended his proposed transfer. His proposed move to Wolves continued until August 2002, and late that month he trained with Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur. He played in a practice match for Tottenham, but after they failed to follow up their interest in him Wolves made a bid to sign him on loan, which York rejected. After Marlon Beresford left York, and Howarth's proposed moves elsewhere fell through, he re-signed for the club in September 2002 on a week-to-week contract. Despite this, he spent two days on trial with Premier League club Newcastle United in late September 2002. Howarth's first appearance of 2002–03 came in a 4–3 away defeat to Lincoln City on 22 October 2002 in the Football League Trophy Northern Section first round, after Fettis was rested due to injury.|$|E
25|$|In league play, players gain {{additional}} {{skills and}} abilities based on their accumulation of experience points. Players face <b>potential</b> <b>injury</b> or even death on the field throughout their careers. Teams improve by the purchase of off-field staff such as cheerleaders, assistant coaches, and apothecaries. Disparity between team values is offset by the purchase of ad-hoc star players or mercenaries, as well as bribes and additional temporary support staff, such as wizards or a halfling cook.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2006 season, Boras advised J. D. Drew {{to opt out}} of {{the final}} three years and $33 million {{remaining}} on his contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Boras then negotiated a five-year, $70 million contract for Drew with the Boston Red Sox. The contract was not finalized until January 26, 2007, because Boras and the Red Sox had to develop special contract language regarding <b>potential</b> <b>injury</b> to Drew's shoulder. Drew had the shoulder surgically repaired earlier in his career.|$|E

2500|$|Symptoms {{remaining}} {{more than}} six months after trauma is labelled Whiplash syndrome. The main purpose with early rehabilitation is to reduce the risk for development of Whiplash syndrome. Early rehabilitation for whiplash depends on the grade category. It can be categorized as grade 0 being no pain to grade 4 with a cervical bone fracture or dislocation. [...] Grade 4 obviously needs admission to hospital while grade 0-3 can be managed as outpatients. The symptoms from the <b>potential</b> <b>injury</b> to the cervical spine may be debilitating, and pain was reported {{to be one of the}} biggest stressor events experienced in daily living, so it is important to begin rehabilitation immediately to prevent future pain.|$|E
2500|$|Metal pipe {{is often}} used for fences instead of wood and if {{properly}} installed, can be fairly safe in the right circumstances. [...] Pipe is often the most expensive fencing option, but is low maintenance and is very strong. [...] Pipe will generally not give or break if it is run into or if the horse puts a foot through it, which can itself be a <b>potential</b> <b>injury</b> risk; horse owners debate the relative merits and dangers of pipe versus wood for horse fencing. [...] Usually pipe is most suitable for very small areas such as pens where a horse may often bump or test the fence, but will not be at risk of colliding with the fence at full speed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{adaptive}} value of nociception is obvious; an organism detecting a noxious stimulus immediately withdraws the limb, appendage or entire {{body from the}} noxious stimulus and thereby avoids further (<b>potential)</b> <b>injury.</b> [...] However, a characteristic of pain (in mammals at least) is that pain can result in hyperalgesia (a heightened sensitivity to noxious stimuli) and allodynia (a heightened sensitivity to non-noxious stimuli). [...] When this heightened sensitisation occurs, the {{adaptive value}} is less clear. [...] First, the pain arising from the heightened sensitisation can be disproportionate to the actual tissue damage caused. [...] Second, the heightened sensitisation may also become chronic, persisting well beyond the tissues healing. [...] This can mean that rather than the actual tissue damage causing pain, it is the pain due to the heightened sensitisation that becomes the concern. [...] This means the sensitisation process is sometimes termed maladaptive. [...] It is often suggested hyperalgesia and allodynia assist organisms to protect themselves during healing, but experimental evidence to support this has been lacking.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To analyse the injury-related {{content of}} children’s {{television}} programmes preferred by boys and by girls, {{and to determine}} whether there are more televised models of unsafe behaviour in programmes preferred by boys. Methods: Parents of 4 – 11 -year-old children identified their children’s favourite television programmes. Content analysis of 120 episodes of children’s favourite programmes was used to quantify safe and risky behaviours, actual <b>injuries</b> and <b>potential</b> <b>injuries.</b> The gender of the characters portraying the behaviours was also analysed. Results: More risky behaviour was portrayed in the boys’ favourite programmes (mean per episode = 6. 40) than in the girls’ favourite programmes (mean= 2. 57). There were almost twice as many <b>potential</b> <b>injuries</b> (n= 310) as actual <b>injuries</b> (n= 157). <b>Potential</b> <b>injuries</b> were portrayed more often by male characters (mean= 1. 92) than female characters (mean= 0. 98), mostly in the boys’ favourite programmes. Actual injuries occurred more often to male characters (mean= 1. 04) than to female characters (mean= 0. 27) overall. Conclusions: Television programmes preferred by this sample of boys portrayed male role models engaging in risky behaviours and injuries more often than the programmes preferred by the sample of girls...|$|R

2500|$|The second {{component}} is {{the experience of}} [...] "pain" [...] itself, or suffering – the internal, emotional interpretation of the nociceptive experience. Again in humans, this is when the withdrawn finger begins to hurt, moments after the withdrawal. Pain is therefore a private, emotional experience. Nociceptive reflexes act to immediately remove the animal {{or part of the}} body from a (potentially) damaging stimulus. [...] However, without learning from this experience, the animal would likely expose itself to the damaging stimulus repeatedly. [...] Pain has the adaptive advantage that it invokes a level of learning, thereby preventing the animal from repeatedly exposing itself to <b>potential</b> <b>injury.</b> Pain cannot be directly measured in other animals, including other humans; responses to putatively painful stimuli can be measured, but not the experience itself. To address this problem when assessing the capacity of other species to experience pain, argument-by-analogy is used. This is based on the principle that if an animal responds to a stimulus in a similar way to ourselves, it is likely to have had an analogous experience.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the station}} made its formal debut, its {{first night of}} regular {{broadcasts}} did not go smoothly. On the date of its sign-on, the station's studio facilities were in the latter stages of construction; at one point, Amon Carter accidentally stepped into an unmarked hole in the studio floor {{that led to the}} building's basement, narrowly saved from enduring <b>potential</b> <b>injury</b> by Star-Telegram cartoonist Johnny Hay. A power outage near the transmitter facility also knocked WBAP-TV off the air for 17 minutes around 8:00p.m. Angry viewers subsequently called into the station, blaming engineers for an outage that was beyond their control; after the power problems were fixed, another viewer calling into the station complained to a receptionist {{about not being able to}} receive WBAP-TV's signal, not realizing that the television station could not be picked up through their radio receiver. Even still, Fort Worth Press reporter Jack Gordon wrote regarding the station's first night of programming that [...] "part of Fort Worth's inaugural television show [...] looked like our first roll of home movie film. But a good deal more of it was excellent – enough so to convince the stubbornest critic that television is here to stay." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speedball {{is played}} {{in an open}} field that could be {{compared}} to a soccer field, it is flat {{with a minimum of}} natural obstacles, and sometimes artificial turf is used, especially in indoor fields. The first speedball fields were constructed with flat wooden obstacles staked into the ground to provide cover; this concept was further developed into a number of urban-scenario field styles with larger building-like obstacles for casual play, but speedball itself progressed to using smaller obstacles made from plastic drainage pipe, which offered a more variable field layout and some [...] "give" [...] to the obstacles for increased safety. Eventually, inflatable fabric [...] "bunkers" [...] were developed based on common obstacle shapes from previous fields, such as [...] "snake" [...] and [...] "can" [...] bunkers. The use of inflatable obstacles both increases player safety by reducing <b>potential</b> <b>injury</b> from collisions with obstacles, and allows them to be easily moved to reconfigure the field or to set up temporary fields. Tournaments such as the PSP hold different events throughout the summer months all over the United States. Speedball games were originally started as a way to make the game safer for players who might trip on uneven woodland terrain. Speedball is generally a fast-paced game where many more balls are used than in woodsball style games. The Markers used are usually more [...] "High Tech" [...] in a sense that they are controlled by an electronic board and have very high rates of fire(upwards to 20 ball per second).|$|E
