In later years, Gräf returned to Weimar, both his - and Goethe's - hometown.|$|R

What a scorcher I got, next mail! Such irony! such sarcasm, such caustic praise of my superhonorable loyalty to the public! And withal, such compassion for my stupidity, too, in not being able to understand my own language. I cannot remember the words of this letter broadside, but there was about a page used up in turning this idea round and round and exposing it in different lights.|$|R
50|$|Holt <b>printed</b> some {{unfavorable}} <b>remarks</b> {{about certain}} ancestors of Lord Dunmore {{and started a}} quarrel with him, the royal governor of the colony of Virginia. Dunmore sent fifteen of King George's soldiers to Holt's printing shop and took all of the types {{and parts of the}} printing press. In the presence of two to three hundred spectators the soldiers took these printing accessories and carried them back onto Dunmore's ship Eilbeck, offshore. It was rumored that Dunmore wanted to print newspapers himself in vindication. However, he had no ink and only parts of a press, so was unable to print. The soldiers were looking for Holt's son to capture but couldn't find him as he was hiding and eventually escaped the territory.|$|R
60|$|With {{respect to}} the four lacs of rupees, he gets Sir John D'Oyly, in the {{narrative}} that he makes before the House of Commons, positively to deny in the strongest manner, {{and he says the}} Nabob would give oath of it, that the Nabob never gave a commission to any one to make such an offer. That such an offer was made had been long published and long in <b>print,</b> with the <b>remarks</b> such as I have made upon it in the Ninth Report of the Select Committee; that the Committee had so done was well known to Mr. Hastings and Sir John D'Oyly; not one word on the part of Mr. Hastings, not one word on the part of Sir John D'Oyly was said to contradict it, until the appearance of the latter before the House of Commons. But, my Lords, there is something much more serious in this transaction. It is this,--that the evidence produced by Mr. Hastings is the evidence of witnesses who are mere phantoms; they are persons who could not, under Mr. Hastings's government, eat a bit of bread but upon his own terms, and they are brought forward to give such evidence as may answer his purposes.|$|R
5000|$|Johnson was on {{the verge}} of real success when his shop was ravaged by fire on 9 January 1770. As one London {{newspaper}} reported it: Yesterday morning, between six and seven o'clock a fire broke out at Messrs. Johnson and Payne's, Booksellers, in Paternoster Row, which consumed that house, Mr. Cock's, Printer, and Mr. Upton's, an Auctioneer ... in which last mentioned house was kept the whole stock of Bibles, Common Prayers, Etc. belonging to the Proprietors of the Oxford Press ... It was a considerable time before the engines could be brought to play to any purpose, on account their being clogged by ice and snow. The several families were all in bed when the fire was first discovered, and Mr. Johnson had but just time to alarm his partner and the rest of the family, and they escaped, saving only some of their books of account, the whole stock in trade and furniture being destroyed. At the time Fuseli had been living with Johnson and he also lost all of his possessions, including the first <b>printing</b> of his <b>Remarks</b> on the Writings and Conduct of J. J. Rousseau. Johnson and Payne subsequently dissolved their partnership. It was an amicable separation, and Johnson even published some of Payne's works in later years.|$|R
40|$|SEVEN UNPUBLISHED LETTERS OF MARKO MARULIĆ There is {{no doubt}} that it is {{only a small part of}} Marulić 2 ̆ 7 s {{correspondence}} written between 1501 and 1516 that the author of this article has discovered in the Archivio di Stato di Venezia, more precisely in the fascicle 2557 of the notaio Jacopo Grasolari. The found letters obviously represent only a random selection from a far more extensive correspondence. Yet, this small collection contains three important letters written in Italian and addressed to the canonico of Split Jeronim Ćipiko, sojourning in Venice, and four Latin letters which Marulić sent to the aforementioned Grasolari, a prominent Venetian notary-public, canonico of St. Mark, cancelliere of the Venetian Senate and papal adviser. Both men were close friends of Marulić and, what is even more important, mediators in the affairs regarding the printing of his works in Venice. In the first letter, which he sent to Jeronim Ćipiko on July 19, 1501, Marulić informs his friend on the death of his brother Ivan and the grave conditions of his sick brother Petar. Discussing the latest events on the battlefield and the bitter defeats suffered by the Croatian and Hungarian troopers and stradiotti, the poet on the same occasion sends to the publisher his recently completed short historic-philosophical treatise in Italian. The treatise was obviously enclosed with the letter, but unfortunately it has not been fouop in the Archive. At the end, post scriptum, the poet communicates to his friend that he has completed his epic in Croatian, the »Judith«. In his second letter to Ćipiko (July 26, 1501) Marulić describes the death of his second brother Petar, citing the medical diagnosis of plague. After a brief meditation on fraternal love and Christian consolations, he concludes the 2 ̆ 7 letter asking for a word of friendly support. In the third letter to Ćipiko (November 2, 1501) Marulić describes the course of his mother 2 ̆ 7 s illness and the difficulties which he met in managing the household after her death, before his brother Valerije arrived. He demands the return of the manuscript of the »Judith« in order to make some emendations and changes »se non è comminzata stampirse. « Also, he complains over ill manners of his wife 2 ̆ 7 s cousin Antonio d 2 ̆ 7 Alberti, enclosing with the letter a series of new sonnets. In his first letter to Jacopo Grasolari (March 3, 1502) Marulić discusses the impor tance and significance of spiritual friendship, concluding that such a relationship is al· ways salutary for literary activity. His reflections on the current tragic events recall popular eschatological writing. On August 25 (the year is missing), in his second letter to Grasolari Marulić concentrates on his new work, the »De imitatione Christi". He requires the return of the manuscript, after the publishing is completed, and prays for a couple of copies of the »Evangelistarium«, which has already been <b>printed</b> (this <b>remark</b> points to the year 1516 as the probable time of the writing of the letter). In his third letter to Grasolari (April 4, 1507) Marulić thanks his friend for the »De Institutione" whose printing has been successfully completed, informing him that he has already started working on »De imitatione Christi«. He is planning to have the work completed by the next year. The »Vita Beati Hieronymi« is finished and is now being copied. In his fourth letter (Apri 126, 1515) Marulić asks to be informed, through his brother Valerije, whether the printing of »De imitatione Christi« is under way; the emended manuscript has already been sent back to the publisher and certain »persons at Split«, who had read the manuscript before the changes and corrections were entered, are now putting pressure on Marulić to have it published. Where the »Judith« is concerned, special interest is roused on the part of the author by Marulić 2 ̆ 7 s assessment ofhis own opera »in lingua nostra materna [...] . composta e more poetico [...] . la lingua schiava ha el suo Dante«, since this represents the most explicit proof that our poet was aware of the poetic model s of his time, for one thing Dante. This refers not only to his adoption of the conventions of Dante 2 ̆ 7 s poetic school but to his choice of the national language, as well. Speaking of the sonnets, interesting is Marulić 2 ̆ 7 s remark that they appeared in one of the darkest moments of his life »non sapendo altramente aleviarmi el fastidio che patisco«, which means that for him literary activity was source of catharsis and peace of mind. Although the sonnets, apparently enclosed with the letter, have disappeared, it is now certain that they must be the same sonnets that M. Deanović published in 1936, doubting whether to ascribe them to Marulić or to somebody else from his circle. The author of the present article proves that the sonnets were written by Marulić himself and goes on to explain their thematic and psychologicallinks with the first and the third letters addressed to Ćipiko (July 19 and November 2, 1501). Since the letters contain several pieces of information concerning the »De imitatione Christi«, we now know that the manuscript was completed around 1508, emended and sent back to Grasolari in 1515, but it still remains unclear why the work remained unpublished. Also we learn that the manuscript of the »Vita beati Hieronymi« was finished in 1507 and that Marulić wrote it with particular enthusiasm, convinced that it contained some important literary innovations. Yet, like the »De imitatione Christi«, it was never published...|$|R
6000|$|I {{received}} your letter, wherein {{you tell}} me of the strange representations made of us on {{your side of the}} water. The instance you are pleased to mention is that of the Presbyterian missionary, who, according to your phrase, hath been lately persecuted at Drogheda for his religion: But it is easy to observe, how mighty industrious some people have been for three or four years past, to hand about stories of the hardships, the merits, the number, {{and the power of the}} Presbyterians in Ireland, to raise formidable ideas of the dangers of Popery there, and to transmit all for England, improved by great additions, and with special care to have them inserted with comments in those infamous weekly papers that infest your coffee-houses. So, when the clause enacting a Sacramental Test was put in execution, it was given out in England, that half the justices of peace through this kingdom had laid down their commissions; whereas upon examination, the whole number was found to amount only to a dozen or thirteen, and those generally of the lowest rate in fortune and understanding, and some of them superannuated. So, when the Earl of Pembroke was in Ireland and the Parliament sitting, a formal story was very gravely carried to his Excellency by some zealous members, of a priest newly arrived from abroad to the north-west parts of Ireland, who had publicly preached to his people, to fall a-murdering the Protestants; which, though invented to serve an end they were then upon, and are still driving at, it was presently handed over, and <b>printed</b> with shrewd <b>remarks</b> by your worthy scribblers. In like manner, the account of that person who was lately expelled our university for reflecting on the memory of King William, what a dust it raised, and how foully it was related, is fresh enough in memory.[2] Neither would people be convinced till the university was at the pains of publishing a Latin paper to justify themselves. And, to mention no more, this story of the persecution at Drogheda, how it hath been spread and aggravated, what consequences have been drawn from it, and what reproaches fixed on those who have least deserved them, we are already informed. Now if the end of all this proceeding were a secret and mystery, I should not undertake to give it an interpretation, but sufficient care hath been taken to give it sufficient explanation.[3] First, by addresses artificially (if not illegally) procured, to shew the miserable state of the dissenters in Ireland by reason of the Sacramental Test, and to desire the Queen's intercession that it might be repealed. Then it is manifest that our Speaker, when he was last year in England, solicited, in person, several members of both Houses, to have it repealed by an act there, though it be a matter purely national, that cannot possibly interfere with the trade and interest of England, and though he himself appeared formerly the most zealous of all men against the injustice of binding a nation by laws to which they do not consent. And lastly, those weekly libellers, whenever they get a tale by the end relating to Ireland, without ever troubling their thoughts about the truth, always end it with an application against the Sacramental Test, and the absolute necessity there is of repealing it in both kingdoms. I know it may be reckoned a weakness to say anything of such trifles as are below a serious man's notice; much less would I disparage the understanding of any party to think they would choose the vilest and most ignorant among mankind, to employ them for assertors of a cause. I shall only say, that the scandalous liberty those wretches take would hardly be allowed, if it were not mingled with opinions that some men would be glad to advance. Besides, how insipid soever those papers are, they seem to be levelled to the understandings of a great number; they are grown a necessary part in coffee-house furniture, and some time or other may happen to be read by customers of all ranks, for curiosity and amusement; because they lie always in the way. One of these authors (the fellow that was pilloried I have forgot his name)[4] is indeed so grave, sententious, dogmatical a rogue, that there is no enduring him; the Observator[5] is much the brisker of the two, and I think farther gone of late in lies and impudence, than his Presbyterian brother. The reason why I mention him, is to have an occasion of letting you know, that you have not dealt so gallantly with us, as we did with you in a parallel case: Last year, a paper was brought here from England, called, [...] "A Dialogue between the Archbishop of Canterbury and Mr. Higgins," [...] which we ordered to be burnt by the common hangman, as it well deserved; though we have no more to do with his Grace of Canterbury[6] than you have with the Archbishop of Dublin[7]; nor can you love and reverence your prelate more than we do ours, whom you tamely suffer to be abused openly, and by name, by that paltry rascal of an Observator; and lately upon an affair wherein he had no concern; I mean the business of the missionary at Drogheda, wherein our excellent primate was engaged, and did nothing but according to law and discretion. But because the Lord Archbishop of Dublin hath been upon several occasions of late years, misrepresented in England, I would willingly set you right in his character. For his great sufferings and eminent services he was by the late King promoted to the see of Derry. About the same time, he wrote a book to justify the Revolution, wherein was an account of King James's proceedings in Ireland, and the late Archbishop Tillotson recommended it to the King as the most serviceable treatise that could have been published at such a juncture.[8] And as his Grace set out upon those principles, he has proceeded so ever since, as a loyal subject to the Queen, entirely for the succession in the Protestant line, and for ever excluding the Pretender; and though a firm friend to the Church, yet with indulgence toward dissenters, as appears from his conduct at Derry, where he was settled for many years among the most virulent of the sect; yet upon his removal to Dublin, they parted from him with tears in their eyes, and universal acknowledgments of his wisdom and goodness. For the rest, it must be owned, he does not busy himself by entering deep into any party, but rather spends his time in acts of hospitality and charity, in building of churches, repairing his palace, in introducing and preferring the worthiest persons he can find, without other regards; in short, in the practice of all virtues that can become a public or private life. This and more, if possible, is due to so excellent a person, who may be justly reckoned among the greatest and most learned prelates of his age, however his character may be defiled by such mean and dirty hands as those of the Observator or such as employ him.[9] ...|$|R
