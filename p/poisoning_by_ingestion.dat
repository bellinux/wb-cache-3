50|$|The first {{indication}} of iron <b>poisoning</b> <b>by</b> <b>ingestion</b> is stomach pain, as iron is corrosive to {{the lining of}} the gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach. Nausea and vomiting are also common symptoms and bloody vomiting may occur. The pain then abates for 24 hours as the iron passes deeper into the body, resulting in metabolic acidosis, which in turn damages internal organs, particularly the brain and the liver. Iron poisoning can cause hypovolemic shock due to iron's potent ability to dilate the blood vessels. Death may occur from liver failure.|$|E

50|$|Although {{tundra swan}} numbers are stable {{over most of}} its range, they are {{increasingly}} dependent on agricultural crops to supplement their winter diet, as aquatic vegetation in their winter habitat dwindles due to habitat destruction and water pollution. But {{the main cause of}} adult mortality is hunting; 4,000 whistling swans are bagged officially each year, while a further 6,000-10,000 are killed by poachers and native subsistence hunter-gatherers. Bewick's swan cannot be hunted legally, but almost half the birds studied contained lead shot in their body, indicating they were shot at by poachers. Lead <b>poisoning</b> <b>by</b> <b>ingestion</b> of lead shot is a very significant cause of mortality also, particularly in the whistling swan. The tundra swan is not considered threatened by the IUCN due to its large range and population.

40|$|Paraphenylenediamine (PPD) is {{commonly}} used in several industries (dyeing furs, photochemical processes, tyre vulcanisation industries, oxidisable hair dye, etc.). Its allergic effect is well established and many studies are devoted to the subject, but PPD systemic poisoning is not understood. Several acute PPD poisoning cases (accidental or intentional) had been reported, in particular, from Africa and Asia where it is traditionally used mixed with Henna to colour palms of hands and soles of feet and to dye hair. We examine here an eleven-year (1992 - 2002) retrospective of PPD poisoning reported to the Poison Control Centre of Morocco. It revealed 374 cases with a female predominance (77 %). The majority of poisoning was intentional (78. 1 %) and the group most prone to PPD poisoning were the young population (15. 1 - 25 and 25. 1 - 35 years-old-age groups) accounting for 54. 3 % and 15. 2 %, respectively. 21. 1 % of poisoning cases were fatal, and the source/route of <b>poisoning</b> was <b>by</b> <b>ingestion</b> in {{the largest number of}} cases (93 %). 50 % of poisoning were from the south of Morocco, where phytotherapy knowledge is very developed.

5|$|On Midway Atoll, {{collisions}} between Laysan albatross {{and aircraft}} {{have resulted in}} human and bird deaths as well as severe disruptions in military flight operations. Studies {{were made in the}} late 1950s and early 1960s that examined the results of control methods such as the killing of birds, the levelling and clearing of land to eliminate updrafts and the destruction of annual nesting sites. Tall structures such as traffic control and radio towers killed 3000 birds in flight collisions during 1964–1965 before the towers were taken down. Closure of Naval Air Facility Midway in 1993 eliminated the problem of collisions with military aircraft. Recent reductions in human activity on the island have helped reduce bird deaths, though lead paint pollution near military buildings continues to <b>poison</b> birds <b>by</b> <b>ingestion.</b> Albatross plumes were popular in the early 20th century.

40|$|Background: Lidocaine {{is a local}} {{anesthetic}} and antiarrhythmic agent. There {{are reports}} on accidental and intentional cases of poisoning following injection of lidocaine while rare are the fatal cases realized after oral ingestion of lidocaine. Suicidal poisoning with lidocaine pharmaceutical formulations is rare since no pharmaceutical dosage forms for oral use are available except gels and sprays used as local anesthetics in dentistry. Cases: Three cases of suicidal <b>poisoning</b> <b>by</b> <b>ingestion</b> {{of the content of}} lidocaine topical spray are reported in the present study. The cases developed episodes of seizure requiring diazepam and other therapeutic modalities upon admission. Eventually, one of the cases expired. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first reported case of suicidal poisoning after ingestion of this formulation which highlights the fact that lidocaine topical spray formulation may be used for committing suicide. Ingestion of lidocaine present in topical spray can induce varying levels of toxicity that can even be fatal. ...|$|E

Methodology: Cross-sectional survey using an injury surveillance database from emergency departments in South Brisbane, Mackay and Mt Isa, Queensland, from January 1998 to December 1999. There were 1516 children aged 0 - 14 years who presented following ingestional poisoning. Results: The presentation rates for poisoning were 690, 40 and 67 per 100 000 population aged 0 - 4, 5 - 9 and 10 - 14 years, respectively. The admission rates to hospital for poisoning were 144, 14 and 22 per 100 000 population aged 0 - 4, 5 - 9 and 10 - 14 years, respectively. Although presentation rates for poisoning {{were higher in the}} rural centres the admission rates were disproportionately high for the 0 - 4 years age group. The agents most frequently ingested were paracetamol, Dimetapp(R), rodenticides and essential oils.

50|$|Locoweed is {{relatively}} palatable to livestock, and some individual animals will seek it out. Livestock <b>poisoned</b> <b>by</b> chronic <b>ingestion</b> of {{large amounts of}} swainsonine develop a medical condition known as locoism (also swainsonine disease, swainsonine toxicosis, locoweed disease, and loco disease; North America) and pea struck (Australia). Locoism is reported most often in cattle, sheep, and horses, but has been reported also in elk and deer. It is the most widespread poisonous plant problem in the western United States. Agricultural Research Service and New Mexico State University scientists have been collaborating since 1990 to help solve the problem that locoweed presents to livestock farmers. The research involved identifying the fungal species that produces the locoweed toxins, pinpointing levels of toxicity in animals once they have ingested locoweed, observing the effects of locoweed toxins on livestock’s reproduction and grazing preferences, etc. Together, the scientists assembled a grazing management scheme to help farmers avoid the poisonous locoweed.|$|R
40|$|Summary: Amitraz is an insecticide/acaricide.

40|$|Historically, {{mortality}} after Amanita mushroom ingestion has {{ranged from}} 50 % to 90 %. Prompt diagnosis is imperative, and aggressive therapeutic measures must be instituted quickly {{to improve the}} outcome. We report successful treat-ment of two cases of A. virosa poisoning by use of combined therapies, including thioctic acid and hemoperfusion. <b>Poisoning</b> <b>by</b> <b>ingestion</b> of toxic mushrooms is increasing (1 - 3). About 100 cases are reported annually in the United States, although the actual incidence is probably higher. The state of Wisconsin had 25 confirmed cases of mushroom poisoning in 1981 (4). Mushroom poisoning is more com-mon in Europe; in Germany alone, 200 cases are reported annually (5). Amatoxins are responsible for 95 % of fatal mushroom poisonings. Historically, within four to seven days after ingestion, the mortality rate has been 50 % to 90 %, the highest rate being in children. Recent reports of combined-modality therapy describe better results, with 20 % to 50 % mortality (6 - 8). In North America, most (> 90 %) deaths are due to A manita phalloides (“death cap”) {{and only a few}} to A. muscaria or A. virosa poisoning (2, 5). Here we present two cases of successful treatment of A. virosa poisoning and illustrate the role of the clinical chemical laboratory in following the clinical course of the toxicity on the various organ systems...|$|E

This study intends to explore the exposure routes and treatment patterns of methanol cases reported to Texas Poison Centers. METHODS: All cases of methanol exposures from January 2003 to May 2005 were collected from the Texas Poison Center Network database "Toxicall. " Inclusion criteria were 1) methanol as primary exposure, and 2) documented route of exposure. Exclusion criteria were unknown, dermal, and eye exposures. Data was extracted from documented calls to Texas Poison Centers and analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 203 cases were collected from 6 regional Poison Centers. Eighty seven cases had inhalation as the route of exposure, while 81 were methanol ingestions. Carburetor cleaner was responsible for nearly all the inhalational cases (79 / 87) while ingestions involved mostly windshield washer fluid (39 / 81) and carburetor cleaner (20 / 81). Seventy-eight percent of the inhalational exposures were intentional {{while most of the}} ingestions were accidental (49 / 75) and suicidal (18 / 75). An anion gap was documented in 31 of the inhalational cases and in 10 of the ingestions. Dialysis, use of fomepizole, and vision loss were documented for both types of exposure. Fifty-six percent of the inhalational group was admitted compared to 46 % of the ingestion group. CONCLUSION: We propose that the results obtained from our review show inhalational exposure involving methanol (e. g., "huffing") represents a significant source of toxicity in the studied population. This is in contrast to previous literature that proposed inhalational toxicity was rare and aggressive treatment usually not necessary in cases of inhalation of methanol-containing carburetor cleaners...|$|E
