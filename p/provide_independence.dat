40|$|Abstract—With the {{increasing}} number of providers offering cloud-based services, new opportunities arise to build applications capable of avoiding vendor lock-in issues. Such applications are developed in multi-cloud environments that allow replacing services with those offered by alternative providers. While this may improve quality and <b>provide</b> <b>independence</b> from a single cloud service provider, it also brings new risks. Being able to assess risks and those quality aspects that are specifically related to multi-cloud environments is essential in order to design reliable applications based on the use of cloud services. Although a lot of work has been done to study risks and quality aspects for cloud services, this is usually focused in single-provider scenarios.

40|$|Many {{of the new}} {{generation}} of satellites to be flow by DLR/GSOC apply the new packet telemetry and telecommand protocols as defined in the ESA Packet Telemetry and Telecommand Standards. Consequently, GSOC had to upgrade its multi-mission control center facilities in order to include the required new functionality. Due to the fact that, for many of its missions, GSOC requires cross support from other agencies, the existing capabilities particularly those relating to external ground stations interfaces had to be retained and in some cases expanded. The new Packet Telecommand Standard had a major impact on the GSOC telecommand System architecture, the "Frame Operations Procedure" (FOP) of the "Command Operations Procedure" (COP- 1) protocol had to be integrated into the existing system. This was primarily to ensure that ESA standard compliance was retaind within the GSOC control center itselfs and also to <b>provide</b> <b>independence</b> from the many ground stations integrated into the support network.

Abstract Phased Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (PMIMO) radar is currently an active area of research. The MIMO technique well studied and developed over the years exploits the multipath environment to its benefit for providing reliable and faster communication. Incorporating the MIMO concept in radar design to <b>provide</b> <b>independence</b> between the transmitted signals with each transmit antenna transmitting orthogonal signal provide distinct advantages over the phased array system {{with respect to the}} maximum number of targets that could be uniquely identified, increased degree of freedom, higher angular resolution, better parameter identifiability and RCS estimation. However the system lacked the coherent processing gain feature that allowed beam steering in phased array radar. MIMO technique applied to the traditional Phased array radar was investigated and was found to offers numerous advantages over both the phased array radar system and the MIMO radar. The goal {{of this paper is to}} elucidate the key concepts of the MIMO radar and PMIMO radar technology that can be incorporated in an Airborne Warning and Control System as an improved and alternative radar arrangement...|$|E
40|$|Wheelchair mounted robotic arms {{have been}} commercially {{available}} for the last decade. They <b>provide</b> <b>independence</b> to people with disabilities. However, a user must have {{a high level of}} cognitive load to operate these robot arms. Our target audience includes people who use power wheelchairs and have cognitive impairments as well. Thus, we must reduce the cognitive load. Our research focuses on replacing the standard menu-based interface with a vision-based system while adding autonomy to the robot arm to execute a “pick-and-place ” activity of daily living. Instead of manual task decomposition and execution, the user explicitly designates the end goal and the system then autonomously reaches towards the object. We designed and implemented human-robot interfaces compatible with indi-rect (e. g., single switch scanning) and direct (e. g., touch screen and joystick) selection. We implemented an autonomous system to reach towards an object. We evaluated the interfaces and system first with able-bodied participants and then end-users from the target population. Based upon this work, we developed guidelines for interface design and experimental design for human-robot interaction with assistive technology. ii ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I would like to first thank my advisor, mentor, and friend, Dr. Holly Yanco, for believing in my academic research potential and providing the necessary support and guidance along the way.

40|$|Abstract— 4 G is {{expected}} to get deployed by many telecom companies in this year. Technologies employed by 4 G being tested and {{going to hit the}} commercial market soon. When fully implemented, 4 G {{is expected}} to offer high speed transmission and provide seamless handoffs across multiple high speed heterogeneous networks. These heterogeneous networks on converged platform provide access to varied services over an IPv 6 core. Convergence & high speed would provide opportunity to end user to use compounded services from varied network providers; this will lead to big challenge for accounting, Charging and billing. This paper in continuation of our previous papers [7][21] discusses a Convergent Framework Architecture (CFA) which provides a unified bill to the user for all his compounded usage across varied network operators. The CFA introduces a trusted third party operator called the Convergent Network Operator (CNO) to achieve a transparent charging, accounting and unified billing provisions. The functionality of the CFA is demonstrated with a prototype. We were able to realize unified bill to end user for the usage of different type of service from varied network providers. This concept and business model will bring better Quality of service (QoS) not only at competitive price but also <b>provide</b> <b>independence</b> and choice to users to opt for specif ic services from Quality network operators.
