40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a report on the}} {{theoretical}} origins of a decolonizing research sensibility called Indigenous Métissage. This research praxis emerged parallel to personal <b>and</b> <b>ongoing</b> <b>inquiries</b> into historic <b>and</b> current relations connecting Aboriginal peoples and Canadians in the place now called Canada. I frame the colonial frontier origins of these relations – and the logics that tend to inform them – as conceptual problems that require rethinking on more ethically relational terms. Although a postcolonial cultural theory called métissage offers helpful insights towards this challenge, I argue that the postcolonial emphasis on hybridity fails to acknowledge Indigenous subjectivity in ethical ways. Instead, I present an indigenized form of métissage focused on rereading and reframing Aboriginal and Canadian relations and informed by Indigenous notions of place. Doing Indigenous Métissage requires hermeneutic imagination directed towards the telling of a story that belies colonial frontier logics and fosters decolonizing...|$|R

The idea of a teacher acting as a researcher is embraced by the following four traditions of reflective teaching practice: academic, social efficiency, developmentalist and social reconstructivist. The developmentalist tradition considers that the teacher is both a practitioner and a researcher: [...] "The teacher as researcher strand of this tradition has emphasized the need to foster the teacher's experimental attitude toward practice and to help teachers initiate <b>and</b> sustain <b>ongoing</b> <b>inquiries</b> in their own classroom" [...] (Zeichner, 1992, p. 165).|$|R

40|$|Telling autobiographical {{stories is}} {{an action that}} shapes the {{practice}} of educating persons in faith. The action of telling such stories has moral significance. Telling our story expresses the person we are. It forms the person we are becoming. It effects changes {{in the world around}} us. A religious educator is challenged to engage in a reflective <b>and</b> <b>ongoing</b> <b>inquiry</b> into the nature of these stories to see what they express, form, and effect by way of promoting a more just and peaceful world. Students in an introductory Christian ethics course were asked to think about ordinary activities they choose which are morally significant to life as a human person and as member of the human family. Few students had thought about the moral importance of daily activities such as eating, resting, leisure, and driving their cars. Similarly, another overlooked, constitutive and morally significant activity shaping the very fabric of our human experience is storytelling. As human persons we both hear and tell many different kinds of stories that shape an understanding of self, others, our world, and God. In Mighty Stories, Dangerous Rituals, Anderson and Foley (1998) concur storytelling is a constitutive part of the human experience. Religious educators ar...|$|R

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{stages of}} {{designing}} a choice experiment is to define the attributes of interest. The attributes chosen essentially influence all subsequent activities carried out in a choice study. Surprisingly, the process of attribute definition is not the subject of critical <b>and</b> <b>ongoing</b> <b>inquiry.</b> In the context of informing policy, the choice modelling literature suggests that a given set of attributes should (1) reflect public interests, (2) have a sound scientific basis, and (3) provide useful information to end-users. Fulfilling all criteria presents a challenging task to researchers. Conflicts between criteria are possible, and there are currently no guidelines to assist researchers in negotiating their way through potentially competing sets of information and viewpoints. We investigated the potential for divergence between {{members of the public}} and scientific experts. The investigation was carried out across three environmental systems which differed according to their scale and institutional setting. The results showed that attribute definitions do indeed diverge. Critical points of divergence observed across all case studies included: {{the way in which the}} public and experts defined attributes that represented the biodiversity of the system; the public’s inclusion of attributes that represented the terrestrial/marine interface; and the public’s inclination to aggregate attributes when asked to choose their top picks. A number of additional points of divergence were observed, but these were case specific. Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|R
