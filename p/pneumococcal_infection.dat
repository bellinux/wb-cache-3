Pneumococcal endocarditis coexisting with meningitis is rare, especially in healthy individuals. A 66 -year-old woman was admitted with pneumococcal bacteremia, meningitis, and arthritis.

Because of typical presentation of bacterial meningitis characteristics and normal echocardiographic findings, the patient was administered antibiotics for meningitis and arthritis. On hospitalization day 59, she developed a fever, and echocardiography showed severe aortic regurgitation, perforation, and vegetation of the aortic valve. She was diagnosed with pneumococcal endocarditis and underwent aortic valve replacement surgery. In general, invasive <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infections</b> occur in debilitated middle-aged men with predisposing factors such as chronic alcoholism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and immunosuppressive conditions.

40|$|Welders {{are more}} {{susceptible}} to pneumococcal pneumonia. The mechanisms are yet unclear. Pneumococci co-opt the platelet activating factor receptor (PAFR) to infect respiratory epithelial cells. We previously reported that exposure of respiratory cells to welding fumes (WF), upregulates PAFR-dependent <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection.</b> The signaling pathway for this response is unknown, however, in intestinal cells, hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α (HIF 1 α) is reported to mediate PAFR-dependent infection. We sought to assess whether oxidative stress plays a role in susceptibility to <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection</b> via the platelet activating factor receptor. We also sought to evaluate the suitability of nasal epithelial PAFR expression in welders as a biomarker of susceptibility to infection. Finally, we investigated the generalisability of the effect of welding fumes on <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection</b> and growth using a variety of different welding fume samples. Nasal epithelial PAFR expression in welders and controls was analysed by flow cytometry. WF were collected using standard methodology. The effect of WF on respiratory cell reactive oxygen species production, HIF- 1 α expression, and <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection</b> was determined using flow cytometry, HIF- 1 α knockdown and overexpression, and <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection</b> assays. We found that nasal PAFR expression is significantly increased in welders compared with controls and that WF significantly increased reactive oxygen species production, HIF- 1 α and PAFR expression, and <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection</b> of respiratory cells. In unstimulated cells, HIF- 1 α knockdown decreased PAFR expression and HIF- 1 α overexpression increased PAFR expression. However, in knockdown cells <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection</b> was paradoxically increased and in overexpressing cells infection was unaffected.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: In blood culture-proven <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infections,</b> {{streamlining}} empirical {{therapy to}} monotherapy with a penicillin is preferred {{in order to}} reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, adherence to this international recommendation is poor, and curiously it is unclear whether antibiotic streamlining may be harmful to individual patients. We investigated whether streamlining in bacteraemic <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infections</b> is associated with mortality. METHODS: Adults admitted to two Dutch hospitals between 2001 and 2011 with bacteraemic <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infections</b> were retrospectively included. Detailed clinical data on patient characteristics, comorbidities and severity and outcome of disease were obtained in addition to data on antibiotic treatment. Those eligible for streamlining were selected for further analyses. RESULTS: In the 45. 8 % of cases (126 of 275) where antibiotic treatment was streamlined, a lower mortality rate was observed (6. 3 % versus 15. 4 %, P = 0. 021). The decision to streamline was only marginally explained by the 38 determinants accounted for. After correction for potential confounders, the OR for death while streamlining was 0. 45 (95 % CI: 0. 18 - 1. 11, P = 0. 082) in all cases and 0. 35 (95 % CI: 0. 12 - 0. 99, P = 0. 048) specifically in pneumonia cases.
