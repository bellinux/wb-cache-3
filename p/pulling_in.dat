5|$|At {{the end of}} August is {{the annual}} American celebration of Labor Day, the only holiday weekend during this period. Of all the year's holiday {{weekends}} it is reliably the weakest in terms of movie box office, with the top grosser for the weekend being the 2007 Rob Zombie-directed reimagining of Halloween, at $30.5 million. The Sixth Sense, then in its fourth week, is a close second after <b>pulling</b> <b>in</b> $29 million in 1999; in a distant second for opening weekends is yet another horror film, 2012's The Possession with $21.1 million.|$|E

The film was targeted at an audience of both males and females below the age of 25. Jumper grossed $27.3million on 4,600 screens in 3,428 theaters from Friday to Sunday, ranking first for the weekend at the box office. In its first weekend, the film set the record for the largest February release in Korea and had the first place position in 11 of the 30 markets it was released in. For the first two weekends of its release, the film maintained its number one position in international markets, while slipping to the second position in the United States to the release of Vantage Point. The film's worldwide gross is $221,231,186 with $80,172,128 from the box office in the United States and Canada and $142,059,058 from other territories. It was the 28th highest-grossing film worldwide for 2008.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{there were}} a growing range of demands on the mounted police, and they {{struggled}} {{to cope with the}} changes. The rising population drove an increase in the criminal cases tackled by the force: less than 1,000 were investigated in 1900, but within four years the number of cases had risen to over 4,000. There was controversy around what role the mounted police should play in the new towns, and the force became concerned that these were <b>pulling</b> <b>in</b> police manpower, {{at the expense of the}} wider, less populated areas of the Prairies, where the patrolling system had already had to be cut back. A special railway branch was briefly established in 1888, using undercover officers positioned along the railway line to gather intelligence, and plans were put forward, but not enacted, to create a larger detective branch. Attempts were made to enforce the prostitution laws in the new towns – previously these had been largely ignored – with the police informally regulating the local sex industries.|$|E
5|$|The modern Labrador's {{ancestors}} originated on {{the island}} of Newfoundland, now part of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The founding breed of the Labrador was the St. John's water dog, a breed that emerged through ad-hoc breedings by early settlers of the island in the 16th century. The forebears of the St. John's Dog are not known but were likely a random-bred mix of English, Irish, and Portuguese working breeds. The Newfoundland (known then as the Greater Newfoundland) is likely a result of the St. John's Dog breeding with mastiffs brought to the island by the generations of Portuguese fishermen who had been fishing offshore since the 16th century. The smaller short-coated St. John's Dog (also known then as the Lesser Newfoundland) was used for retrieval and <b>pulling</b> <b>in</b> nets from the water. These smaller dogs were the forebears of the Labrador Retriever. The white chest, feet, chin, and muzzle - known as tuxedo markings - characteristic of the St. John's Dog often appear in modern Lab mixes, and will occasionally manifest in Labradors as a small white spot on the chest (known as a medallion) or stray white hairs on the feet or muzzle.|$|E

The show received some of its strongest critical acclaim during the 1980s as well. Many soap critics praised the show for keeping its focus on relationships and family crisis. However, like many soaps at the time, the show did dive into occasional action/crime storylines such as the Sin Stalker murders in 1987 {{as a response to}} the popularity of the action/adventure oriented soap General Hospital during the decade.|$|E
25|$|Zone {{distillation}} is a {{distillation process}} in long container with partial melting of refined matter in moving liquid zone and condensation of vapor in the solid phase at condensate <b>pulling</b> <b>in</b> cold area. The process is worked in theory. When zone heater is {{moving from the}} top {{to the bottom of}} the container then solid condensate with irregular impurity distribution is forming. Then most pure part of the condensate may be extracted as product. The process may be iterated many times by moving (without turnover) the received condensate to the bottom part of the container on the place of refined matter. The irregular impurity distribution in the condensate (that is efficiency of purification) increases with number of repetitions of the process.|$|E
25|$|Normally, {{there are}} {{only a small number of}} ants in any given area on the plant stem. There are about 40 workers per leaf, but {{generally}} only a few will be patrolling outside. Once an insect lands on the plant, the closest ant will immediately surface and grab on to a leg, antenna, wing, or some other appendage of the prey. This ant will pull the prey, which will try to escape by <b>pulling</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction. However, the ant will rarely let go of its grip. The ant immobilizes the prey and, using an extreme feat of strength, will hold the much larger prey to the plant as more ants from around that area arrive. This ability to hold the prey is extremely important because the ants move and congregate fairly slowly.|$|E

25|$|The overall {{price of}} the event was {{reportedly}} £20million. The Australian newspaper Herald Sun estimated A$32million for security and A$800,000 for flowers. Estimates of {{the cost to the}} economy of extra public holidays, such as that allowed for the wedding, vary between £1.2billion and £6billion. The British government tourist authority VisitBritain predicted the wedding would trigger a tourism boom that would last several years, eventually <b>pulling</b> <b>in</b> an additional 4million visitors and generating £2billion. However, VisitBritain's head of research and forecasting, David Edwards, suggested to colleagues two days after the engagement was announced that the evidence points to royal weddings having a negative impact on inbound tourism. He noted that the number of visitors to Britain was down significantly in July 1981, when Prince Charles and Diana were married, from the same period in other years, and also July 1986, when Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson were married, was down from July 1985.|$|E
25|$|Al Capone was {{the most}} notorious gangster of his generation. Born on January 17, 1899 in Brooklyn, New York; Capone settled in Chicago to take over Johnny Torrio's {{business}} dealing with outlawed liquor. Within three years, Capone had nearly 700 men at his disposal. As the profits came in, Capone acquired finesse—particularly {{in the management of}} politicians. By the middle of the decade, he had gained control of the suburb of Cicero, and had installed his own mayor. Capone's rise to fame did not come without bloodshed. Rival gangs, such as the Gennas and the Aiellos, started wars with Capone, eventually leading to a rash of killings. In 1927, Capone and his gang were <b>pulling</b> <b>in</b> approximately $60 million per year—most of it from beer. Capone not only controlled the sale of liquor to over 10,000 speakeasies, but he also controlled the supply from Canada to Florida. Capone was imprisoned in 1929 for tax violations and died January 25, 1947, from a heart attack, pneumonia, and syphilis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A Fixed – Fixed RF MEMS switch {{has been}} {{simulated}} for various air gaps and the {{variation of the}} electrical performance {{in accordance with the}} air gap has been studied. The switch was simulated and the <b>pulls</b> <b>in</b> voltages for different air gaps were practically determined by electrostatic analysis using IntelliSuite software. Subsequently, the theoretical values were determined analytically and the values were found to be closely matching with less than 2 % error. The <b>pull</b> <b>in</b> voltage was found to be 9. 78 V for an air gap of 1. 5 µm and increased to 51. 36 V for an air gap of 4. 5 µm. However, the insertion loss was at – 0. 5522 dB for an air gap of 1. 5 µm at 60 GHz and smaller insertion losses was achieved only with larger air gaps. These investigations showed that large compromise on electrical performance is required for lower <b>pull</b> <b>in</b> voltage which is essential for the use of these switches in mobile applications. Considering these difficulties the authors have proposed a varying section fixed – fixed beam switches that can be designed to give lower <b>pull</b> <b>in</b> voltages even for larger air gaps. Therefore these proposed switches can ensure superior electrical performance along with low <b>pull</b> <b>in</b> voltages...|$|R
