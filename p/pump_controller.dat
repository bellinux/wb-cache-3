40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} and {{investigate}} the optimal {{control of a}} group of 104 heat pumps and a central Combined Heat and Power unit (CHP). The heat pumps supply space heating and domestic hot water to households. Each house has a buffer for domestic hot water and a floor heating system for space heating. Electricity for the heat pumps is generated by a central CHP unit, which also provides thermal energy to a district heating system. The paper reviews recent smart grid control approaches for central and distributed levels. An online algorithm is described based on the earliest deadline first theory that can be used on the aggregator level to control the CHP and to give signals to the heat <b>pump</b> <b>controllers</b> if they should start or should wait. The central controller requires only a limited amount of privacy-insensitive information from the heat <b>pump</b> <b>controllers</b> about their deadlines, which the heat <b>pump</b> <b>controllers</b> calculate for themselves by model predictions. In this way, a robust heat pump and CHP control is obtained, which is able to minimize energy demand and results in the desired thermal comfort for the households. The simulations demonstrate fast computation times due to minor computational and communication overheads...|$|R

5000|$|Conserve Water During Testing - NFPA-25 {{requires}} that the fire <b>pump</b> <b>controller</b> is operated for 10 minutes each week.

In contrast, under the same conditions variable speed will waste no water.|$|E

40|$|An {{automated}} <b>pumping</b> <b>controller,</b> {{which is}} able to maintain constant pressure in a hydraulics system and will not have any physical contact with the medium, is addressed in this paper. The reason to do some research on the automated <b>pumping</b> <b>controller</b> {{is that it will}} surely address the lack of products currently available within the industrial control field for pump pressure control in a hydraulics system. Constant pressure control within a hydraulic pumping system is conventionally performed by the use of an electric pump with a variable speed controlling of the pump. In the traditional control system, a pressure transmitter is used as a feedback of the pump which in turn, also controls the pressure in the system. This research proposes to establish that control of the pumping system without the use of a pressure transmitter. Along with the control system itself, a user interface was developed to operate over the Ethernet ensuring the ability to utilize current WEB server interfaces such as windows Explorer and the like. ...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{photovoltaic}} (PV) array for pumping {{water is}} one of the most promising techniques in solar energy applications. Due to the increased use of water pumping systems in urban areas, more attention has been paid to their design and performance prediction under different operating conditions.

40|$|In neural interfaces, a major {{challenge}} is finding an electronic material that will {{be accepted by the}} human body. Currently, electrode arrays are often made from silicon, but graphene seems to be a better material for humans due to its biocompatibility and flexibility. However, it is unknown how neural cells react to being electrically stimulated on graphene. For this work, we will observe the interactions between graphene electrodes and cultured neural stem cells using a probe station specially designed for electrophysiology. The cells are kept in a salt solution contained in a 3 D printed reservoir. This is mounted on top of a graphene sample and is attached to a fluidic system consisting of two <b>pump</b> <b>controllers</b> that refresh the solution at a small rate, thus keeping the cells alive for several hours. This also allows us to introduce different salt concentrations and/or chemicals that modify the cellular environment, and thus the interactions with the graphene.

40|$|Abstract. The {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is to present a model-based approach to requirements engineering for reactive systems, and more specifically to controllers. The approach suggests the creation of a CPN model based on several diagrams, for validating the functional requirements of the system under development. An automatic gas <b>pump</b> <b>controller</b> is used as case study. We propose a generic structure for the CPN model to address the modelling of the controller, the physical entities which the controller interacts with, and the human users that operate the system. The CPN modules for modelling the behaviour of the human users and the controller are instances of a generic module that is able to interpret scenario descriptions specified in CPN ML. ...|$|E
