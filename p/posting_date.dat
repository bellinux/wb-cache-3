Titan shares, for which acceptance had been received by Honam after the <b>posting</b> <b>date</b> and up to 5pm closing date on December 24, 2010, were listed as 27.25%, representing 470.89 million shares, according to Titan in a filing. On November 1, 2010, Titan received a notice of unconditional takeover offer from Honam to acquire all remaining shares (excluding treasury shares) following Honam’s sale and purchase agreement in July to buy a 72.32% stake, or 1.25 billion shares, in Titan Chemicals for RM2.94 billion.|$|E
50|$|While critics criticise philanthrojournalism {{for being}} unsustainable, {{they fail to}} {{acknowledge}} the hybrid models many NPJs have adapted to. Many nonprofit centers receive their revenue through a total or partial combination of the following strategies: membership donations, corporate sponsorships or advertising, charging other media for content, providing services such as analyzing and <b>posting</b> <b>date,</b> training students and journalists and creating an endowment. Moreover, unlike mainstream media, which more often than not, continues to utilize print versions, most NPJs are digital-born. They can, therefore, focus all their resources on hiring technicians or reporters with greater expertise in digital media. Many are utilizing social media, which, consequently, is increasingly bringing them closer to younger generations.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, signed {{copies of}} sales drafts were {{included}} in each customer's monthly billing statement for verification purposes—an industry practice known as [...] "country club billing". By the late 1970s, however, billing statements no longer contained these enclosures, but rather a summary statement showing <b>posting</b> <b>date,</b> purchase date, reference number, merchant name, and the dollar amount of each purchase. At the same time, many issuers, particularly Bank of America, {{were in the process}} of changing their methods of finance charge calculation. Initially, a [...] "previous balance" [...] method was used—calculation of finance charge on the unpaid balance shown on the prior month's statement. Later, it was decided to use [...] "average daily balance" [...] which resulted in increased revenue for the issuers by calculating the number of days each purchase was included on the prior month's statement. Several years later, [...] "new average daily balance"—in which transactions from previous AND current billing cycles were used in the calculation—was introduced. By the early 1980s, many issuers introduced the concept of the annual fee as yet another revenue enhancer.|$|E

40|$|Abridged) We present Keck, HST, and Gemini-North {{observations}} of the L 4 +L 4 binary HD 130948 BC which together span ~ 70 % of the binary's orbital period. We determine a total dynamical mass of 0. 109 +/- 0. 002 Msun (114 +/- 2 Mjup). The flux ratio is near unity, so both components are unambiguously substellar for any plausible mass ratio. An independent constraint on {{the age of the}} system is available from the G 2 V primary HD 130948 A. The available indicators suggest an age comparable to the Hyades, with the most precise age being 0. 79 Gyr based on gyrochronology. Therefore, HD 130948 BC is now a unique benchmark among field L and T dwarfs, with a well-determined mass, luminosity, and age. We find that substellar theoretical models disagree with our observations. Both components of HD 130948 BC appear to be overluminous by a factor of ~ 2 - 3 x compared to evolutionary models. The age of the system would have to be notably younger than the gyro age to ameliorate the luminosity disagreement. However, regardless of the adopted age, evolutionary and atmospheric models give inconsistent results, indicating systematic errors in at least one class of models, possibly both. The masses of HD 130948 BC happen to be very near the theoretical mass limit for lithium burning, and thus measuring the differential lithium depletion between B and C will provide a uniquely discriminating test of theoretical models. The potential underestimate of luminosities by evolutionary models would have wide-ranging implications; therefore, a more refined age estimate for HD 130948 A is critically needed.
