5|$|The {{big game}} starts with six players, {{including}} Howard and the Kid, with Shooter playing as he deals and Lady Fingers relieving him whenever Shooter needs a break. In {{the first big}} confrontation between the Kid and Howard, the Kid is short $2,000 and Slade steps in to stake him. Several hours later, Howard busts a player called Pig, <b>perhaps</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bluff, and the remaining players take a break. Following the break, Lady Fingers, who has been delighting in needling Howard all evening, takes over as dealer and continues to needle him.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} cottage gardens {{were more}} practical than today's, {{with emphasis on}} vegetables and herbs, fruit trees, perhaps a beehive, and even livestock. Flowers, used to fill spaces, gradually became more dominant. The traditional cottage garden was usually enclosed, <b>perhaps</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rose-bowered gateway. Flowers common to early cottage gardens included traditional florists' flowers such as primroses and violets, along with flowers with household use such as calendula and various herbs. Others were the richly scented old-fashioned roses that bloomed once a year, and simple flowers like daisies. In time, cottage-garden sections were added to some large estate gardens as well.|$|E
5|$|Scotland Yard issued another {{appeal in}} March 2014 for {{information}} {{about a man who}} had entered holiday homes occupied by British families in four incidents in the western Algarve between 2004 and 2006, two of them in Praia da Luz. On those occasions he sexually assaulted five white girls, aged 7–10, in their beds. The man spoke English with a foreign accent and his speech was slow and perhaps slurred. He had short, dark, unkempt hair, tanned skin, and in the view of three victims a distinctive smell; he may have worn a long-sleeved burgundy top, <b>perhaps</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> white circle on the back. These were among 12 incidents in the area between 2004 and 2010. The Polícia Judiciária reportedly believed the intruder in the four incidents between 2004 and 2006 was Euclides Monteiro, the former Ocean Club employee from Cape Verde who died in 2009.|$|E

The autopsy further revealed signs of torture, which was inconsistent with the confession. The autopsy also uncovered signs {{that he had been}} bludgeoned <b>perhaps</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stick. Cuts and bruises all over True's arms could have indicated torture or some kind of defensive wounds. The report concluded that True was dead before he ended up in the deep ravine.|$|E
25|$|By comparison, Earth's present global {{equilibrium}} temperature is 255 K (−18°C), which is raised to 288 K (15°C) by greenhouse effects. However, when life evolved early in Earth's history, the Sun's energy output {{is thought to}} have been only about 75% of its current value, which would have correspondingly lowered Earth's {{equilibrium temperature}} under the same albedo conditions. Yet Earth maintained equable temperatures in that era, <b>perhaps</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> more intense greenhouse effect, or a lower albedo, than at present.|$|E
25|$|After the Babylonian {{conquest and}} {{during the period of}} Achaemenid rule, notable drops in the {{population}} of Jerusalem, the Sphephelah and the Negev region occurred, while a continuity is maintained in the northern Judean and Benjamin areas. Along the coastal region the Phoenician presence expanded, while the Cisjordan underwent demographic change with the inflow of Moabite and Ammonite refugees, while the southern part of Judea underwent substantive change with the settlement of Edomites.

25|$|Usually {{referred}} to in works on architecture as foliate heads or foliate masks, carvings of the Green Man may take many forms, naturalistic or decorative. The simplest depict a man's face peering out of dense foliage. Some may have leaves for hair, <b>perhaps</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> leafy beard. Often leaves or leafy shoots are shown growing from his open mouth and sometimes even from the nose and eyes as well. In the most abstract examples, the carving at first glance appears to be merely stylised foliage, with the facial element only becoming apparent on closer examination. The face is almost always male; green women are rare.|$|E
25|$|With {{the rapid}} {{industrialisation}} {{and population growth}} of 19th century Glasgow great numbers were eager {{to be released from}} the grimy city on Fast Days and during the annual Glasgow Fair week, went on a cruise down the Clyde to clean unspoilt scenery. Tiny villages, <b>perhaps</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stone jetty, soon became resorts with wooden piers and villas, hotels and public houses. Local residents would let out rooms, and boarding houses developed. Established towns like Dunoon and Rothesay became major resorts. The wealthy built sandstone villas at places like Kilcreggan, Blairmore and Innellan to which they could commute daily, or weekly, during the summer.|$|E
25|$|To the {{north-east}} of {{the forum}} is the amphitheater. This is of normal Roman pattern, although {{much smaller than}} later examples. Only the western half is visible; in 1930 AD, a road was built across the site, burying the eastern half. It is said by local inhabitants that the civil engineer responsible was tried, convicted and received a prison sentence for what was described as wanton destruction of a historic site. There is also a small circular council hall (bouleuterion) or assembly space (ekklesiasterion), with seats in tiers. It was probably never roofed, but had a wall around it, <b>perhaps</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small arcade round the inside. This ceased to {{have a role in}} Roman times and was filled over.|$|E

25|$|Langdale {{called in}} his {{advanced}} parties, <b>perhaps</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> view to resuming {{the duties of}} advanced guard, {{on the night of}} 13 August, and collected them near Longridge. It is not clear whether he reported Cromwell's advance, but, if he did, Hamilton ignored the report, for on 17 August Monro was half a day's march to the north, Langdale east of Preston, and the main army strung out on the Wigan road, Major-General William Baillie with a body of foot, the rear of the column, being still in Preston. Hamilton, yielding to the importunity of his lieutenant-general, James Livingston, 1st Earl of Callendar, sent Baillie across the Ribble to follow the main body just as Langdale, with 3,000 foot and 500 horse only, met the first shock of Cromwell's attack on Preston Moor. Hamilton, like Charles at Edgehill, passively shared in, without directing, the Battle of Preston, and, though Langdale's men fought fiercely, they were driven to the Ribble after four hours' struggle.|$|E
25|$|Mousa's {{walls are}} the best {{preserved}} and are still 13m tall; {{it is not clear}} how many brochs originally stood this high. A frequent characteristic is that the walls are galleried: with an open space between, the outer and inner wall skins are separate but tied together with linking stone slabs; these linking slabs may in some cases have served as steps to higher floors. It is normal for there to be a cell breaking off from the passage beside the door; this is known as the guard cell. It has been found in some Shetland brochs that guard cells in entrance passageways are close to large door-check stones. Though there was much argument in the past, it is now generally accepted among archaeologists that brochs were roofed, <b>perhaps</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> conical timber framed roof covered with a locally sourced thatch. The evidence for this assertion is still fairly scanty, although excavations at Dun Bharabhat, Lewis, may support it. The main difficulty with this interpretation continues to be the potential source of structural timber, though bog and driftwood may have been plentiful sources.|$|E
25|$|The {{community}} of visible interacting beings and the cosmos {{is referred to}} as ụ̀wà, which includes all living things íhẹ́ ndi dị́ ńdụ̀, including animals and vegetation and their mineral elements which possess a vital force and are regarded as counterparts to invisible forces in the spirit world. These living things and geomorphological features of the world therefore possess a guardian deity. Igbo cosmology presents a balance between the feminine and masculine, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> preponderance of female representation in Igbo lore. In Igbo cosmology, the world was divided into four corners by the high god corresponding to èké órìè àfọ̀ ǹkwọ́ which are the days of the week in the Igbo calendar regarded as market days. The universe is regarded as a composite of bounded spaces in an overlapping hemispherical structure, the total spaces are referred to as élú nà àlà. In one Igbo cosmological theory reported by W.R.G. Morton in the 1950s from an elder in Ibagwa Nike in northern Igboland, Chukwu sees that the sun travels across the world in the day time and then cuts into two in order for the moon to pass on a perpendicular route, and so the world is divided into four parts and four days. The quarterly division of the earth and the days makes the number four sacred (ńsọ́) to the Igbo. The élú nà àlà space is defined by two boundaries: élú ígwé, 'sky's limit' composed of heavenly bodies under the main forces of the 'masculine' sun and 'feminine' moon, and élú àlà, 'earth or lands limit' consisting of the four material elements of fire and air (masculine), and earth and water (feminine).|$|E

500|$|Islamic funerary art is {{dominated}} by architecture. [...] Grave goods are discouraged {{to the point that}} their absence is frequently one recognition criterion of Muslim burials. Royalty and important religious figures were typically buried in plain stone sarcophagi, <b>perhaps</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> religious inscription. [...] However, funerary architecture often offered a means of [...] "moving beyond the strictures of formal Muslim burial rites" [...] and expressing social dimensions such as status, piety, love for the deceased, and Muslim identity. A number of distinct architectural traditions arose for expressing these social elements. [...] The Islamic tradition was slow in starting; the hadith [...] "condemn the building of tombs, and Muhammad himself set the example of requesting burial in an unmarked grave in one of the chambers of his house" [...] in Medina, though by at least the 12th century, buildings of the vast Al-Masjid an-Nabawi complex already marked the site. [...] The earliest identified Muslim monumental tomb, in Samarra in Iraq, only dates from 862, and was commissioned by the Byzantine princess whose son was buried there. [...] At some point, the tradition incorporated the idea of a garden setting, perhaps following the Islamic concept of Paradise, an association certainly made when the tradition was mature, although the difficulty of reconstructing gardens from archaeology makes the early stages of this process hard to trace. [...] At any rate, gardens surrounding tombs became established in Islamic tradition {{in many parts of the}} world, and existing pleasure gardens were sometimes appropriated for this purpose. [...] Versions of the formal Persian charbagh design were widely used in India, Persia and elsewhere.|$|E
