PT Smart Tbk Surabaya {{is one of the}} private manufacturing industries which are existed in the processing of palm oil. There are unbalance condition during processing the product. The output of the production is different from the customer demand. It happened because there are some wastes during the filling process. This research is focus on solving the problem by using Lean Manufacturing and creating the improvement in filling proces by using line balancing method. The purpose of value stream mapping is to identify waste during filling process. Tools of lean manufacturing and line balancing are used to reducetion the cycle time in a palm oil production. Based on the analysis, there will be four improvements. They are improvement the sequence of filling process; combine the operation of <b>plugging</b> <b>and</b> <b>capping,</b> continuous flow by line balancing and layout redesign. This improvement can reduce the defect rate, the number of operation time up to 188. 55 second/batch, increase the line efficiency to be 79. 83...|$|R
5000|$|The correct fluid is a {{synthetic}} mineral oil, such as Pentosin ATF-1 or Volkswagen G 052 162 A2. 3.750 liters is usually sufficient for a filter change. The transmission fluid is checked {{from underneath the}} vehicle while running and the transmission in park. This must be completed before the transmission fully warms up. Once running, the drain plug {{on the bottom of}} the transmission oil pan is removed with a 5mm allen wrench. Some fluid will drip out whether oil level is full or low. There is a plastic stack in the hole, similar to a chimney, which keeps all the fluid from running out. This stack maintains the proper level at the proper temperature. If the fluid is [...] "glugging" [...] or just barely running out the bottom hole when the temperature of the transmission is in the range of 95F-113F, no further action is needed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the change in water surface elevation and chloride concentration in the surficial, Mid Hawthorn, and Lower Hawthorn aquifers in the Cape Coral peninsula between 1980 and 1999. Seawater intrusion is a major concern in the Cape Coral area because the city is surrounded by open bodies of saline or brackish waters: Matlacha Pass to the west, San Carlos Bay to the south and Caloosahatchee River to the east. Prior to 1980, the principal groundwater withdrawals were from the Mid Hawthorn aquifer, with some smaller withdrawals from the surficial and Lower Hawthorn aquifers. Since 1980, many wells in the City of Cape Coral have been <b>plugged</b> <b>and</b> <b>capped,</b> decreasing the movement of water between the aquifers. In addition, withdrawals have primarily shifted to the Lower Hawthorn, which is now the principal water supply for the City of Cape Coral. Between 1980 and 1999 the water surface elevation in the surficial aquifer has remained relatively stable and chloride concentrations have decreased. During the same period, chloride concentrations have remained stable within the Mid Hawthorn aquifer. However, the potentiometric surface of the Mid and Lower Hawthorn has decreased and the chloride concentrations in the Lower Hawthorn in the vicinity of the City 2 ̆ 7 s wellfield have increased as a direct result of increased withdrawals. In addition, the area of highest chloride concentration within the City has moved west from its historic location, toward the City 2 ̆ 7 s reverse osmosis plant. The facility is roughly at the center of the wellfield that supplies water to the plant from the Lower Hawthorn. The potentiometric surface of the Mid Hawthorn has also decreased in the outlying areas of the Cape, mostly to the south and east, due to downward seepage into the Lower Hawthorn and well field pumping to the south in Ft. Myers, and east of Cape Coral along US 41...|$|R
5000|$|Second Lieutenant Jeppson, {{along with}} then Captain William [...] "Deak" [...] Parsons of the U.S. Navy were {{responsible}} for arming the atomic bomb [...] "Little Boy" [...] on the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber during the flight from Tinian to Japan.

40|$|Noise is the {{insidious}} of all industrial pollutants, involving every {{industry and}} causing {{severe hearing loss}} in {{every country in the}} world. Exposure to excessive noise is the major avoidable cause of permanent hearing impairment. Worldwide, 16 % of the disabling hearing loss in adults is attributed to occupational noise, ranging from 7 to 21 % in the various subregions. The estimated cost of noise to developed countries ranges from 0. 2 to 2 % {{of the gross domestic product}} (GDP). Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is bilateral and symmetrical, usually affecting the higher frequencies (3 k, 4 k or 6 k Hz) and then spreading to the lower frequencies (0. 5 k, 1 k or 2 k Hz). Other major health effects are lack of concentration, irritation, fatigue, headache, sleep disturbances, etc. The major industries responsible for excessive noise and exposing workers to hazardous levels of noise are textile, printing, saw mills, mining, etc. Hearing protectors should be used when engineering controls and work practices are not feasible for reducing noise exposure to safe levels. Earmuffs, ear <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> ear canal <b>caps</b> are the main types of hearing protectors. In India, NIHL has been a compensable disease since 1948. It is only in 1996 that the first case got compensation. Awareness should be created among workers about the harmful effects of noise on hearing and other body systems by implementing compulsory education and training programs. There are very few published studies of NIHL in India. More extensive studies are needed to know the exact prevalence of NIHL among the various industries in India...|$|R
40|$|Morphological, ultrastructural, and cytochemical {{characteristics}} of the red alga Plocamium cartilagineum from Antarctica have been studied and {{compared with those of}} the same species from the Mediterranean Sea. Distinct regions with possibly different functions were recognisable in the bushy thallus of Plocamium cartilagineum. Chloroplasts were concentrated in the outermost cell layer, while in the other cortex cells abundant floridean starch accumulated. No starch was found in the large medullary cells, characterised by the insertion in their walls of several large and lenticular pit connections devoid of <b>plug</b> <b>caps</b> <b>and</b> proteic in nature. Sulphated polysaccharides were distributed in the extracellular compartments of all the regions of the thallus, except in the surface layer. These acidic phycocolloids were particularly concentrated in the cell wall proper, which also exhibited a well organised fibrillar component probably consisting of cellulose. The distinctive feature of the Antarctic thalli, compared with the Mediterranean ones, was the lack, in the former, of recognisable phycobilisomes on the thylakoid surfaces. This peculiarity had already been noticed in the other Antarctic red alga Iridaea cordata, collected, like Plocamium cartilagineum, in summer and from ice free waters. The loss of phycobilisomes may be a defence mechanism activated by benthic shade-adapted red algae from Antarctica to protect the photosynthetic apparatus against damage from high light intensities...|$|R
