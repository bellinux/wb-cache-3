40|$|The nominal {{composition}} of PBX is 94. 9 % HMX, 2. 5 % Estane 5703, 2. 5 % bis- 2, 2 -dinitropropyl acetal/formal (nitroplasticizer, NP), and 0. 1 % stabilizer (diphenylamine, DPA or Irganox 1010). In {{addition to the}} stabilizer added to the PBX formulation, the NP eutectic liquid contains 0. 1 % of the stabilizer <b>phenyl-beta-naphthylamine</b> (PBNA). For PBX 9501 containing weapons, {{it is known that}} NP migrates from the charge into the shield polymer, and ethylene-vinyl acetate-vinyl alcohol terpolymer, becomes saturated over time with NP and that migration is then stopped. Experiments have been performed showing the saturation concentration of the shield material to be 8. 8 weight percent. Prior to this work, analyses were performed on weapon components from a W 76 unit that had been in the stockpile for 172 months. The HE, stress cushions, and shields were analyzed for NP and for possible products of NP decomposition. Although no evidence of NP decomposition was found, it was discovered that the PBX stabilizer and the HMX impurity, RDX, were also moving into the shields. This paper will summarize the analytical data obtained from a number of weapons of various ages. Quantitation of NP, DPA, Irganox, RDX, and PBNA has been performed on shields from six different W 76 units...|$|E
40|$|The ready {{availability}} and low price of furfural, which is obtainable from annually renewable raw materials, and {{the ease of}} polymerization of this material by ionic catalysts, {{without the use of}} beat or pressure, suggested its use in the manufacture of low-cost casting plastics. It had previously been shown that the Incorporation of furfurin resulted in a material having satisfactory strength and appearance, but the material was unsuited for commercial applications because the mineral acids used as condensing agents continued to diffuse to the surface of molded articles over long periods of time;In this study, the effects {{of a large number of}} additive compounds other-than furfurin were investigated. It was found that best results were obtained by incorporation of a pair of additives. One additive was a form of lignin; the other was any one of a number of compounds falling Into two general classes. The first class was made up of secondary aromatic amines; those compounds from this class which were found to be most effective were furfurin, diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine, <b>phenyl-beta-naphthylamine</b> and diphenylamine. The second class was made up of furan derivatives whose substituent groups bad a relative electronegativity less than that of aldehyde group of furfural. Compounds from this class which were found to be most effective were furfurin, methylfuran, and furfuralurea. The furfuralurea was prepared in situ;It was found that the use of p-toluenesulfonic acid an a condensing agent resulted in a plastic which did not give the problems of acid diffusion which were encountered when mineral acids were used. The use of bromine also was a complete solution to the problem of acid diffusion, but the resulting product was limited in its applicability by a lower strength;The plastic resulting from the condensation with p-toluenesulfonic acid of the casting syrups described has a beautiful, glossy black appearance, remarkable flame resistances and good resistance to chemical reagents. It can be fabricated without expensive molding equipment, and is comparable in cost to the cheapest canting resins on the market today. This plastic should find use wherever an opaque, infusible, and insoluble material is suitable...|$|E
