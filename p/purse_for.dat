25|$|Despite {{interest}} in a bout with Khan, Floyd Mayweather {{announced that he would}} fight 30 year old Marcos Maidana (35–3, 31 KOs) on 3 May 2014. On 24 March, Khan decided to fight 32 year old former champion Luis Collazo (35-5, 18 KOs) on the undercard at the MGM Grand Las Vegas. Prior to the fight, Collazo han't lost since October 2011. The fight was for the vacant WBA International welterweight title and WBA title eliminator as well as Vacant WBC Silver title. Khan was too fast and too disciplined for Collazo, flooring him in the fourth round and twice in the 10th. The judges scored the fight 117-106, 119-104, 119-104 in Khan's favour. Khan and Collazo both incurred point deductions in round 8. Collazo hit Khan with a low blow while Khan was holding his head down. Collazo's failed approach resulted in a mismatch on the scorecards. Collazo fought with his hands down most of the night, unafraid of Khan, believing Khan had no power and he would eventually knock him out. In the post fight interview in the ring after the bout, Khan credited his 12 months of boxing training with Virgil Hunter for his success.

25|$|Gandhi {{questioned}} {{the continued existence}} of a privy <b>purse</b> <b>for</b> former rulers of princely states. She argued the case for abolition based on equal rights for all citizens and the need to reduce the government's revenue deficit. The nobility responded by rallying around the Jana Sangh and other right-wing parties that stood in opposition to Gandhi's attempts to abolish royal privileges. The motion to abolish privy purses, and the official recognition of the titles, was originally brought before the Parliament in 1970. It was passed in the Lok Sabha but felt short of the two-thirds majority in the Rajya Sabha by a single vote. Gandhi responded by having a Presidential proclamation issued; de-recognizing the princes; with this withdrawal of recognition, their claims to privy purses were also legally lost. However, the proclamation was struck down by the Supreme Court of India. In 1971, Gandhi again motioned to abolish the privy purse. This time, it was successfully passed as the 26th Amendment to the Constitution of India. Many royals tried to protest the abolition of the privy purse, primarily through campaigns to contest seats in elections. They, however, received a final setback when many of them were defeated by huge margins.|$|E
