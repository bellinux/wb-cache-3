50|$|A modern {{development}} of the traditional harrow is the rotary <b>power</b> <b>harrow,</b> often just called a <b>power</b> <b>harrow.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A rotary <b>power</b> <b>harrow,</b> {{or simply}} <b>power</b> <b>harrow,</b> has {{multiple}} sets of vertical tines. Each set of tines is rotated on a vertical axis and tills the soil horizontally. The result is that, unlike a rotary tiller, soil layers are not turned over or inverted, which {{is useful in}} preventing dormant weed seeds from being brought to the surface, {{and there is no}} horizontal slicing of the subsurface soil that can lead to hardpan formation.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, Harrow {{enhanced}} {{criminals to}} superhuman status for a fee, the hapless Megawatt his first known subject. When Hammerhead rose to prominence, Harrow observed his ex-patient's battles with Spider-Man, whom he {{perceived as a}} challenge. He enhanced another criminal, Kangaroo (Frank Olver), who ungratefully scorned Harrow's schemes. Harrow continued providing services to villains like Living Laser, but when Will o' the Wisp sought removal of his <b>power,</b> <b>Harrow</b> implanted a surgical device to extort him into theft.|$|E
40|$|Soil surface {{roughness}} (SSR) and porosity were evaluated from soils located in two farms {{belonging to the}} Plant Breeding Institute of the University of Sidney. The sites differ in their soil management practices; the first site (PBI) was strip-tilled during early fall (May 2010), and the second site (JBP) was under <b>power</b> <b>harrowed</b> tillage {{at the end of}} July 2010. Both sites were sampled in mid-August. At each location, SSR was measured for three 1 [*]m 2 subplots using shadow analysis. To evaluate porosity and aggregation, soil samples were scanned using X-ray computed tomography with 5 [*]μm resolution. The results show a strong negative correlation between SSR and porosity, 20. 13 % SSR and 41. 38 % porosity at PBI versus 42. 00 % SSR and 18. 35 % porosity at JBP. However, soil images show that when soil {{surface roughness}} is higher due to conservation and soil management practices, the processes of macroaggregation and structural porosity are enhanced. Further research must be conducted on SSR and porosity in different types of soils, as they provide complementary information on the evaluation of soil erosion susceptibility...|$|R
5000|$|Before {{invention}} of the modern tractor, disc harrows typically consisted of two sections, which were horse-drawn and had no hydraulic <b>power.</b> These <b>harrows</b> were often adjustable so that the discs could be changed from their offset position. Straightening the discs allowed for transport without ripping up the ground; also, they were not as difficult to pull. Overuse of disc harrows in the High Plains of the United States in the early 20th century {{may have contributed to}} the [...] "Dust Bowl".|$|R
50|$|Cyborgs: Before the Last War, {{scientists}} {{could not get}} human Cyborgs to work well due to an inability to perfectly mimic all of the vital organs that people have. Instead, they turned their efforts to making Cyborgs from Harrowed. In addition to cybernetic enhancements and the general abilities that all Harrowed have, some (usually those who were Harrowed before the Cyborg conversion) have access to <b>Harrowed</b> <b>powers.</b> Cyborgs (as well as Harrowed) are detailed in the Cyborgs sourcebook.|$|R
50|$|In cooler climates {{the most}} common types are the disc harrow, the chain harrow, the tine harrow or spike harrow and the spring tine harrow. Chain harrows are often used for lighter work such as {{levelling}} the tilth or covering seed, while disc harrows are typically used for heavy work, such as following ploughing {{to break up the}} sod. In addition, there are various types of <b>power</b> <b>harrow,</b> in which the cultivators are power-driven from the tractor rather than depending on its forward motion.|$|E
40|$|Farmers try {{to reduce}} steps of soil {{preparation}} by using subsoiler and then following by equipment for soil pulverization such as a rotary tiller and a <b>power</b> <b>harrow</b> which take advantage of using a power take-off of a tractor. Therefore, {{this study was conducted}} to compare the tilling performances of a rotary tiller and a <b>power</b> <b>harrow</b> applying after subsoiling. The results showed that both the rotary tiller and the <b>power</b> <b>harrow</b> had negative slip, indicating that they generated force to push a tractor. The rotary tiller created negative vertical force to lift up the tractor whereas opposite result was found when using the <b>power</b> <b>harrow.</b> Since working depths were different, vertical forces, torques and PTO powers for two equipment types were significantly different. However, {{no significant differences were found}} for the forward speeds, slips, drawbar pulls and drawbar powers. Comparative analysis showed that two equipment types had significant difference in PTO power to working depth, drawbar power to working depth, PTO power to working area, drawbar power to working area and soil pulverization...|$|E
40|$|About 60 % of the {{mechanical}} energy consumed in mechanized agriculture is used for tillage operations and seedbed preparation. On the other hand, unsuitable tillage system resulted in soil degradation, affecting soil physical properties and destroying soil structure. The objective {{of this research was}} to compare the effects of three types of secondary tillage machines on soil physical properties and their field performances. An experiment was conducted in a wheat farm in Jouybar area of Mazandaran as split plots based on randomized complete block design with three replications. The main independent variable (plot) was soil moisture with three levels (23. 6 - 25, 22. 2 - 23. 6 and 20. 8 - 22. 2 percent based on dry weight) and the subplot was three types of machine (two-disk perpendicular passing harrow, <b>Power</b> <b>harrow</b> and Rotary tiller). The measured parameters included: clod mean weight diameter, soil bulk density, specific fuel consumption, machine efficiency and machine capacity. The effects of treatments and their interactions on the specific fuel consumption, machine efficiency and machine capacity and also the effects of treatments on bulk density were significant (...|$|E
50|$|For {{production}} agriculture, {{past and}} present, two-wheel tractors accept {{a wide range}} of implements, such as the following: For soil-working: rototillers, moldboard plows, disc-plows, rotary plows, root/tuber harvesting plows, small subsoiler plows, <b>powered</b> and non-powered <b>harrows,</b> seeders, transplanters, and planters. Even zero till/no-till planters and seeders have become available. In plant protection and weed control, two-wheel tractor implements consist of various inter-cultivators and sprayers. For harvesting, available implements are: Forage: Sickle bar mowers, disk mowers, hayrakes, hay tedders, haybalers and bale wrappers silage production. For grain harvest: reaper/grain harvesters, reaper-binders, and even combine harvesters are available typically only for Asian two-wheel tractors. For transport, trailers with capacities from 0.5 to 5 plus ton cargoes are available. General mowing implements consist of lawn mowers, brush mowers, and flail mowers. For snow removal, implements consist of snowblowers, power sweepers, and snow/dozer blades. Other implements include: chipper/shredders, log splitters, electrical generator, pressure washer, crimper-roller, fertilizer/salt/lime spreader, and stump grinder. This list of implements (which may not be complete) means that two-wheel tractors can execute practically all of the chores done by larger 4-wheel tractors, with the exception of items like front-loaders, which obviously have the physical stability requirements of a 4-wheel (two-axle) tractor.|$|R
40|$|If 2 ̆ 2 tillage 2 ̆ 2 {{is defined}} as the {{mechanical}} manipulation of soil, it follows, then, that a 2 ̆ 2 tillage system 2 ̆ 2 would be the sequence of soil-manipulation operations performed in producing a crop. Today, however, such a definition is recognized as inadequate. We know, for instance, that the management of non-harvested plant tissue (i. e., residue) affects both crop production and soil erosion, and that field operations in which the soil is not tilled have a marked influence on soil condition. Therefore, in this publication, a tillage system is the sequence of all operations involved in producing the crop, including soil manipulation, harvesting, chopping or shredding of residue, application of pesticides and fertilizers, etc. But before describing and comparing the various tillage systems for corn, some terminologies and possible points of confusion need to be addressed. These have to do with primary vs. secondary tillage and the different ways in which similar tillage systems could be defined. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY TILLAGE For many tillage systems, the specific operations can be separated into 2 ̆ 2 primary 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 secondary. 2 ̆ 2 Primary tillage loosens and fractures the soil to reduce soil strength and to bring or mix residues and fertilizers into the tilled layer. The implements (2 ̆ 2 tools 2 ̆ 2) used for primary tillage include moldboard, chisel and disk plows; heavy tandem, offset and one -way disks; subsoilers; and heavy -duty, powered rotary tillers. These tools usually operate deeper and produce a rougher soil surface than do secondary tillage tools; however, they differ from each other as to amount of soil manipulation and amount of residue left on or near the surface. Secondary tillage is used to kill weeds, cut and cover crop residue, incorporate herbicides and prepare a seedbed. The tools include light- and medium -weight disks, field cultivators, rotary hoes, drags, <b>powered</b> and unpowered <b>harrows</b> and rotary tillers, rollers, ridge- or bed -forming implements, and numerous variations or combinations of these. They operate at a shallower depth than primary tillage tools and provide additional soil pulverization. Equipment that permits primary and/or secondary tillage plus planting in a single operation is also available...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{variability}} of soil environment within one field {{and its effect on}} the quality of seedbed preparation for winter cereals. There are described efforts to better identifying of each part of the field. The field variability can be tested by special instruments or by commonly used agricultural machinery. The factors influencing the yield of winter cereals, or the yield of other cultural plants, are described in a deep analysis of the present state of science. The main soil characteristics are discussed both in short-term and long-term sights. A detailed analysis of construction of powered machines for seedbed preparation and methods of seedbed preparation for winter cereals are described. The thesis contains an analysis of recommendation for correct preparation of the seedbed. Observation of the soil variability was done with a view to measuring and evaluating some representative values of the strength force of a tractor engine, power requirements for <b>power</b> <b>harrow,</b> working velocity of a tractor-powered harrow set. Individual values were compared to the precision of seedbed preparation separated into 3 areas according to the measured force level strenght. The effect of soil preparation intensity on the resulting seedbed quality was evaluated. Available from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|E
40|$|The wear {{resistance}} of rotary plows {{operating in a}} clay loam soil was studied. The degree of damage caused to the soil {{and the amount of}} mass lost by the tools were determined in order to establish correlations between the physical properties of the soil and the wear mechanisms acting on the tribosystem. Field tests were carried out in 12 plots and a randomized experimental design with 4 levels, 3 replicas per level and 2 passes per plot was applied. The levels relate to the tillage implements employed: rotary tiller, rotary <b>power</b> <b>harrow,</b> small motorized rotary tiller and control (unaltered soil). The highest mass losses were measured in rotary tiller and rotary power harrow's tools, while the small motorized rotary tiller's tools showed generally lower levels of damage. It was determined that the effective contact time between tool and soil, the rotating speed and the sudden impact forces are the most significant factors affecting the {{wear resistance}} in field operations. Thirty days after tillage operation the soil samples were taken from each plot at a mean depth of 100 mm in order to determine bulk density, gravimetric moisture content and percentage of aggregates smaller than 5 mm. No significant differences among the values of these properties were found in the experiments. The wear mechanisms acting on the tools' surface are complex and include 2 -body and 3 -body abrasion as well as the presence of sudden impact forces...|$|E
40|$|Agricultural {{practices}} {{are believed to}} be the major anthropogenic source of enhanced nitrous oxide (N 2 O) gas emissions in New Zealand. Studies conducted in New Zealand generally suggest low N 2 O emission from pasture; however, there is little information for arable farming systems. This paper evaluates tillage and land use effects on N 2 O emissions using a closed chamber technique at an Ohakea silt loam (Gleyic luvisol) where winter oats (Avena sativa L.) /fodder maize (Zea mays L.) was double-cropped for 5 years. The tillage types included conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems, and a permanent pasture (PP) was used as a control. Spatial variability in all treatments showed large inherent variations in N 2 O fluxes (a mean CV = 119 %), which reflected natural soil heterogeneity, and perhaps the measurement technique used rather than the real differences due to the tillage and cropping systems evaluated. On an annualised basis, N 2 O emissions measured from December 1998 to September 1999 from the PP (1. 66 kg N 2 O-N/ha per year or 19 g N 2 O-N/(m 2 h)) were significantly lower than the CT and NT fields averaging at 9. 20 (or 105) and 12. 0 (or 137) kg N 2 O-N/ha per year (org N 2 O-N/(m 2 h)), respectively. However, there were no differences in N 2 O emission rates between the CT and NT treatments. Seedbed preparation using a <b>power</b> <b>harrow</b> which followed within a few days of first ploughing the CT field reduced N 2 O emissions by 65 % within the first hour after power harrowing. However, N 2 O emission rates returned to the pre-power harrowing levels at the next sampling period, which was 1 month later...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{microprocessor-based}} {{control systems}} on agricultural tractors has eased operator burden by allowing changes to tractor and implement settings {{to be made}} with little physical effort. However, maintaining the optimum tractor-implement settings whilst encountering the variable nature of agricultural conditions still requires {{a high level of}} operator skill, partly due to the need to adjust individual sub-system controllers. CAN-bus communication between electronically controlled vehicle sub. systems provided a new opportunity to enhance vehicle powertrain operation, by intelligently integrating control of the sub-systems. The aim of the project was to develop ways to improve the operational characteristics of a tractor powertrain, by investigating system behaviour, and identifying opportunities for intelligent control. Market research was undertaken which highlighted power-split continuously variable transmissions as a credible alternative to powershift-type transmissions in specific specialist applications where the additional purchase price could be justified. However, there is little scientific evidence to suggest that there are significant improvements in overall vehicle performance to be gained {{through the use of a}} CVT tractor compared to a well operated powershift-type transmission. Improvements to gearshift quality and more intelligent use of the powertrain control features could ensure powershift-type transmissions remain competitive for the foreseeable future. A dynamic mathematical powertrain model was developed for a lOOkW, 16 speed semi-powershift transmission, four wheel drive tractor based on fundamental Newtonian principles. With the addition of implement models, this allowed accurate representation of the tractor-implement system and provided a platform to develop improved vehicle control strategies. Validation of the model with experimental data showed it was an accurate representation of the real system. The steady state and transient field performance of the tractor operating with a mouldboard plough, a <b>power</b> <b>harrow</b> and a laden trailer was determined for a number of tractor-implement configurations across a range of conditions. This provided a David Sayer, 2005 Cranfield University, Silsoe 11 large dataset for this vehicle for use in this, and other investigations. The level of powertrain loading for field experiments was found to be influenced by soil type, implement working width and depth as well as forward speed and engine speed. For the road investigation, the surface quality and terrain were major influencing factors on performance. It was found there was considerable variation in tractor response to the different gearshift types experienced in the semi-powershift transmission: the non-powershift changes being severe, particularly during downshifts; double-swap powershifts were markedly more severe than single-swap shifts. A unique investigation of the tractor driveline torque loss characteristics across the full operating spectrum using the axle dynamometer identified that the torque losses for this transmission are predominantly speed, rather than torque related. A mathematical model was developed to predict driveline torque losses from transmission output speed, flywheel torque and the number of power-transmitting gears in mesh. The axle dynamometer was also used to successfully replicate field loading patterns in real time. Throughout this investigation a number of undesirable powertrain characteristics were identified. Potential improvements to vehicle performance through the development of solutions to these characteristics have been made either through analysis of field data, experiments with the axle dynamometer, or using the developed mathematical model...|$|E
