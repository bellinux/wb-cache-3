40|$|Problembakgrund och syfte: Uppsatsens syfte är att undersöka huruvida det finns samband mellan pensionsredovisningsmetoder och volatilitet i bolagens Eget kapital. Enligt pensionsredovisningsforskningen finns samband mellan pensionsredovisningsmetoder och volatilitet i total Eget kapital. Enligt Amir skapar redovisning av aktuariella vinster och förluster mot Eget kapital (totalresultatet) upphov till volatilitet i Eget kapital. Syftet med uppsatsen är att undersöka om forskningen som påvisar detta samband även stöds gällande Large Cap bolagen i Nasdaq OMX Nordic Stockholm. Stämmer det att bolag som redovisar {{pensioner}} mot Eget kapital (totalresultatet) påvisar större volatilitet i Eget kapital än bolag som använder andra pensionsredovisningsmetoder? Detta är den grundläggande problemställningen i uppsatsen. Metod: För att svara på syftet använder vi oss av bolagens årsredovisningar där vi undersöker vilka pensionsredovisningsmetoder bolagen väljer och volatilitet i total Eget kapital mellan åren 2006 - 2011. Dessa värden sammanställs i Excel och testas i statistikprogrammet SPSS. Resultat och Slutsatser: Hypotesprövningen visar att det inte föreligger samband mellan volatilitet i Eget kapital utifrån de olika pensionsredovisningsmetoderna. Vår slutsats är att bolag inom Nasdaq OMX Nordic Stockholm som redovisar aktuariella vinster och förluster i Eget kapital (totalresultat) inte visar större volatilitet i Eget kapital än bolag som använder andra pensionsredovisningsmetoder. Purpose:  According {{to research}} done in pension accounting, {{there is a}} connection between pension accounting methods and volatility in <b>shareholders</b> <b>equity.</b> Amir claims that full recognition of actuarial gains and losses in the balance sheet creates volatility in <b>shareholders</b> <b>equity.</b> The aim of the paper is to examine whether this connection between pension accounting and volatility can be confirmed among companies in Nasdaq OMX Nordic, Stockholm.  Method: The volatility in <b>Shareholders</b> <b>Equity</b> is examined by researching the annual reports of the companies. Throughout the study, the statistics program SPSS is used.  Analysis: Companies that use full recognition of actuarial gains and losses in the balance sheet are compared to firms that use other pension accounting methods. The level of volatility in <b>shareholders</b> <b>equity</b> among firms that use full recognition of actuarial gains and losses are compared to firms that use other pension accounting methods. The aim is to examine whether companies that use full recognition of actuarial gains and losses show more volatility in share holders equity. Conclusion: According to our study, there is no relationship between pension accounting methods and volatility in <b>shareholders</b> <b>equity.</b> Companies in Nasdaq OMX Nordic Stockholm that recognize actuarial gains and losses directly to the comprehensive income in <b>shareholders</b> <b>equity</b> and debts does not show more volatility in <b>shareholders</b> <b>equity</b> than firms that use other pension accounting methods. ...|$|R

40|$|Do {{you believe}} that bank <b>shareholder</b> <b>equity</b> {{provides}} an indefinitely lasting source of funding which covers for (residual) risk and loss-absorption? Our innovative approach clarifies and disentangles actual shareholder contribution to bank equity. This case study applies it to Deutsche Bank, a European systemically important institution, from 2001 to 2015. Our analysis shows that bank <b>shareholder</b> <b>equity</b> lasted for {{less than three months}} in 2007 in the bank entity, while payout policies exhausted shareholder contribution to loss-absorbing capital in 2006 - 2008. Since 2005, shareholder contribution to Tier 1 Capital remained below 10 %. According to our findings, the actual contribution by <b>shareholders</b> to bank <b>equity</b> capital was limited, while shareholder payout policies, including share buybacks and trading on its own shares, were material. These findings raise concerns on the actual capacity by <b>shareholder</b> <b>equity</b> to assure protection against (residual) risk and loss absorption. Customer and investor protections appear to lay with bank entity equity dynamics. These findings have implications for bank financial sustainability and resilience, company capital maintenance, and regulatory capital requirements. Further developments based upon this innovative methodology may improve on existing prudential and accounting regulations...|$|R
