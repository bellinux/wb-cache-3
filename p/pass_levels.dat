A ROM update was released, reducing the [...] "extra shot power" [...] and [...] "extra shot speed" [...] powerup bonus for Warrior and Wizard, and adding a new points-based difficulty counter to the game. The difficulty counter makes the game more difficult, in 16,384-point steps, which removes more designated food from the levels, and made the monsters respawn faster. However, this means that on the default game difficulty of 4, {{it is almost impossible to}} <b>pass</b> <b>levels</b> 1-7 without dying, and level 4 was designed so that some of the food drops would block the monsters from swarming the player.

40|$|Palm-based DHSA {{is a new}} {{chemical}} {{developed in}} MPOB that has three reactive sites that would enable the preparation of many useful derivatives. New chemicals introduced into the market have to be registered and information on their environmental performance such as biodegradability has to be supplied as required under various national and international laws. Biodegradability screening tests, such as the OECD 301 series, are basic tools for assessment of the environmental fate of chemicals in aquatic environments. A substance is considered readily biodegradable when its biodegradability reaches the <b>pass</b> <b>levels</b> of 60 % carbon dioxide (CO 2) /theoretical carbon dioxide (ThCO 2) evolution, 60 % biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) /theoretical oxygen demand (ThOD) or 70 % dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal within 28 days.

Hence, DHSA is not expected to accumulate in the food chains and will not pose problems in the aquatic environments although it is poorly soluble in water...|$|E
40|$|In our experience, {{insufficient}} consideration is often {{given to the}} way in which the questions in computer-based assessments are scored. The advent of more complex question-styles such as those delivered by the TRIADSystem (Mackenzie, 1999) has made it much more difficult to predict the distribution of possible scores and the base level guess factor than it has been for tests containing simple multiple-choice questions. For example the TRIADS drag and drop template allows each object to be allocated a different score (positive or negative) for each position as well as allowing dummy objects and dummy positions to be defined. The number of score possibilities for a random answer increases dramatically as the number of objects and positions is increased and although a 0 to 100 scoring scale is available, scores are likely to be concentrated about ‘nodes ’ on this measurement scale. The positions of these ‘nodes ’ will vary with the structure of the question and negative or penalty scoring may serve to ‘smear ’ the mark distribution between ‘nodes’. Many tutors may find it difficult to predict the guess factor and will not appreciate the effect that the structure of the question may have on the range and distribution of final scores achieved. In order to demonstrate to test designers the effects of question structure and score allocation on the ‘guess factor ’ and mark distributions, we are developing an empirical Marking Simulator. This program allows test designers/tutors to select a question type, enter the proposed structure and scores for each question then view the mark distribution and measurement scale that would result from a set of entirely random answers.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Background: Decades of {{research}} indicate that physical activity {{is an important}} behavior for health promotion and disease prevention. Despite dissemination of these research findings, many American adults are sedentary. The rates for sedentary behavior vary by race/ethnicity and gender. Women and adults from minority groups {{are most likely to}} be sedentary. Research on adults who are physically active has identified several factors that predispose, enable, and reinforce this behavior. The presence of social support is one such factor. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify the nature and extent of social influence on physical activity in a nationally-representative sample of minority women. Methods: A telephone survey of 2912 women ages 40 and older from various racial/ethnic groups was conducted from July 1996 to June 1997. Information on physical activity as well as other preventive health behaviors was collected. Analysis: Descriptive analyses were done on physical activity levels (including an accumulation of household and occupational physical activity), physical activity-related social support (PASS), support network, and measures of social contact. Logistic regression was used to determine differences in <b>PASS</b> <b>levels</b> and physical activity. Linear Regression was used to determine the relationship between social influence and physical activity level. Results: Women with high levels of physical activity- related social support were more likely to meet recommended levels of physical activity. There was no difference by racial/ethnic group. An index of social influence was not a significant predictor or physical activity level among all women in the sample. Conclusion: While women with higher levels of specific support for physical activity were more likely to be physically active, a more general measure of social support did not predict level of physical activity. More research is needed in assessment of both physical activity and social support in this population...|$|E
