In addition, Burrows realised that new downloadable content {{had the potential to}} bring in more revenue for Studio Liverpool. In order to achieve this, the team {{had to find a way}} to bypass the problems involved in getting the PlayStation Portable to recognise download files. The solution required the use of <b>piggybacking</b> game data to a valid format recognised by the PlayStation Portable; in which a dummy file would be used on a web-based Java application.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Automated <b>piggybacks</b> are {{purported to}} make drug {{administration}} {{safer and more}} reliable. We evaluated the human factors of <b>piggyback</b> infusion, investigated the practice in our institution, and analyzed incidents from an anonymous database to better characterize the practice and substantiate these assertions. Methods: To find examples of problems with <b>piggyback,</b> or secondary infusions, we searched the Food and Drug Administration’s on-line incident database for incidents involving <b>piggybacks.</b> As part of a task analysis, 19 senior nurses each programmed 2 of 4 different pumps for a simulated <b>piggyback</b> infusion. To characterize infusion practice, we evaluated data logs from 55 infusion devices used in our institution. Results: Incidents from the database provided strong evidence that potential problems existed with <b>piggyback</b> infusions. Nurse behaviors suggested mismatches between the task, user, and devices {{that can lead to}} adverse events. Log files showed <b>piggybacks</b> were a common practice, and that available safeguards were not used. Conclusions: Our multiple data sources suggest automated <b>piggyback</b> infusion practice is neither simple nor safe. Incident report analysis suggests these findings contribute to adverse events. Further study is needed to understand and improve the safety of this practice...|$|R

We study three transparent <b>piggyback</b> implementations on multiple produc-tion platforms and demonstrate that all are inefficient for some applica-tion scenarios.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the long. term visual outcomes and complications of the <b>piggyback</b> intraocular lens. (IOL) implantation compared to aphakia for infantile cataract Patients and Methods: In a comparative study from 1998 to 2007, <b>piggyback</b> IOL implantation (<b>piggyback</b> IOL group) was performed for 14 infants (23 eyes) with infantile cataract and 20 infants (32 eyes) who were aphakic (aphakia group) after infantile cataract surgery. Data {{were collected on}} logMAR visual acuity, and postoperative complications over a mean follow-up time of 6. 2 ± 1. 7 years and 5. 8 ± 1. 7 years. Results: The mean age at surgery was 7. 5 ± 0. 6 months and 6. 0 ± 3. 3 months for the <b>piggyback</b> and the aphakic group respectively (P > 0. 05). At the last follow-up visit, visual acuity was 0. 85 ± 0. 73 (median = 0. 70, interquartile range = 0. 3 – 1. 32) in the <b>piggyback</b> IOL group and 0. 89 ± 0. 56 (median = 0. 86, interquartile range = 0. 50 – 1. 24) in the aphakic group (P > 0. 05). There was {{a positive relationship between}} age and visual outcomes in the aphakic group (r = 0. 4, P = 0. 04) but not in the <b>piggyback</b> IOL group (P = 0. 48). There {{was no significant difference between}} the mean myopic shift in the <b>piggyback</b> IOL group (– 5. 28 ± 1. 06 D) and the aphakic group (– 5. 10 ± 1. 02 D) (P > 0. 05). The incidence of reoperation due to complications in <b>piggyback</b> IOL group was higher than aphakic group (% 48 vs. % 16, respectively, P ≤ 0. 01). However, in patients older than 6 months, this risk was not significantly different compared to the aphakic group. Conclusions: Although <b>piggyback</b> IOL implantation for infantile cataract is optically acceptable as a treatment option, there is no significant difference in visual outcomes compared to aphakia.

2500|$|The Macintosh {{contained}} a single 400KB, single-sided 3.5-inch floppy disk drive, dedicating no space to other internal mechanical storage. The Mac OS was disk-based from the beginning, as RAM {{had to be}} conserved, but this [...] "Startup Disk" [...] could still be temporarily ejected. (Ejecting the root filesystem remained an unusual feature of the classic Mac OS until System 7.) One floppy disk was sufficient to store the System Software, an application and the data files created with the application. Indeed, the 400KB drive capacity was larger than the PC XT's 360KB 5.25-inch drive. However, more sophisticated work environments of the time required separate disks for documents and the system installation. Due to the memory constraints (128 KB) of the original Macintosh, {{and the fact that}} the floppies could hold 400 KB, users frequently had to swap disks in and out of the floppy drive. [...] For this reason, external floppy drives were frequently used. [...] The Macintosh External Disk Drive (mechanically identical to the internal one, <b>piggybacking</b> on the same controller) was a popular add-on at US $495. Third-party hard drives were considerably more expensive and usually connected to the slower serial port (as specified by Apple), though a few manufacturers chose to use the faster non-standard floppy port.

What is most revealing of the frailty of today's opinion is that it relies upon nothing but that implication from a dictum, plus its own (quite irrefutable because entirely value laden) [...] "balancing" [...] of the competing demands {{of the individual and}} the State. With respect to the point at issue here, different times and different places — even highly liberal times and places — have struck that balance in different ways. Some Western democracies currently permit the Executive a period of detention without impartially adjudicated cause. In England, for example, the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989, 14(4), 5, permits suspects to be held without presentation and without charge for seven days. 12 Halsbury's Stat. 1294 (4th ed. 1989). It was the purpose of the Fourth Amendment to put this matter beyond time, place and judicial predilection, incorporating the traditional common-law guarantees against unlawful arrest.

Gersteins approval of a [...] "brief period" [...] of delay to accomplish [...] "administrative steps incident to an arrest" [...] is already a questionable extension of the traditional formulation, though it probably has little practical effect and can perhaps be justified on de minimis grounds.

2500|$|Jobs {{stated that}} because [...] "customization really is mostly {{software}} now ... {{most of the}} options in other computers are in Mac", unlike the Apple II the Macintosh 128K did not need slots, which he described as costly and requiring larger size and more power. It was not upgradable by the user and only Apple service centers were permitted to open the case. All accessories were external, such as the MacCharlie that added IBM PC compatibility. There was no provision for adding internal storage, more RAM or any upgrade cards, however some of the Macintosh engineers objected to Jobs's ideas and secretly developed workarounds for them. As an example, the Macintosh {{was supposed to have}} only 17 address lines on the motherboard, enough to support 128k of system RAM, but the design team added an additional two address lines without Jobs's knowledge, making it possible to expand the computer to 512k, although the actual act of upgrading system RAM was difficult and required <b>piggybacking</b> additional RAM chips overtop the onboard 4164 chips. In September 1984, after months of complaints over the Mac's inadequate RAM, Apple released an official 512k machine. Although this had always been planned from the beginning, Steve Jobs maintained if the user desired more RAM than the Mac 128 provided, he should simply pay extra money for a Mac 512 rather than upgrade the computer himself. When the Mac 512 was released, Apple rebranded the original model as [...] "Macintosh 128k" [...] and modified the motherboard to allow easier RAM upgrades. Improving on the hard-wired RAM thus required a motherboard replacement (which was priced similarly to a new computer), or a third-party chip replacement upgrade, which was not only expensive but would void Apple's warranty. The difficulty of fitting software into its limited free memory, coupled with the new interface and event driven programming model, discouraged software vendors from supporting it, leaving the 128K with a relatively small software library. Whereas the Macintosh Plus, {{and to a lesser extent}} the Macintosh 512K, are compatible with much later software, the 128K is limited to specially crafted programs. A stock Mac 128K with the original 64K ROM is neither compatible with Apple's external 800 KB drive with HFS nor with Apple's Hard Disk 20. A Mac 128K that has been upgraded with the newer 128K ROM (called a Macintosh 128Ke) can use internal and external 800 KB drives with HFS, as well as the HD20. Both can print on an AppleShare network, but neither can do file sharing because of their limited RAM.|$|E
