50|$|Metridium senile, {{common name}} the <b>plumose</b> <b>anemone</b> or frilled anemone, is {{a species of}} sea anemone in the family Metridiidae. It {{is found in the}} seas off {{northwest}} Europe and the east and west coasts of North America.|$|E
50|$|Metridium farcimen {{is a long}} lived species. A <b>plumose</b> <b>anemone</b> in this genus is {{reported}} to have lived for nearly 100 years in an aquarium, and even after that time, {{the cause of death was}} equipment failure rather than old age.|$|E
50|$|Metridium farcimen is {{a species}} of sea anemone in the family Metridiidae. It is {{commonly}} known as the giant <b>plumose</b> <b>anemone</b> or white-plumed anemone. It is found on the western seaboard of the United States and Canada and in deep water sites especially where the water is slow moving.|$|E
50|$|Other filter-feeding cnidarians include sea pens, sea fans, <b>plumose</b> <b>anemones,</b> and Xenia.|$|R
50|$|Hoodsport {{is renowned}} among SCUBA divers as a staging area {{to view the}} giant Pacific octopus. Local marine {{preserves}} such as Octopus Hole and Sund Rock offer divers {{the chance to see}} octopus, as well as wolf eels, rock fish, <b>plumose</b> <b>anemones</b> and other marine life.|$|R
50|$|During the 1960s {{the reef}} was fished {{by a small}} fleet of French fishing vessels for crab, {{crayfish}} and lobster. Some of these vessels were the {{first on the scene}} when the Torrey Canyon sank in 1967. On the vertical surfaces there are clusters of jewel anemones and hydroids, and <b>plumose</b> <b>anemones</b> on the more exposed rocks.|$|R
5000|$|The reef {{includes}} {{forests of}} bull kelp up to 100 feet (30m) long, which provide protective habitat for numerous animals, including the bat ray, big skate, broadnose sevengill shark, cabezon, kelp bass, leopard shark, spiny dogfish, kelp greenling, <b>plumose</b> <b>anemone,</b> and numerous species of rockfish. The reef also supports more than 39,000 seabirds, including 5% {{of the common}} murre nesting population in Oregon.|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of hard substrata in the mainly sandy {{environment of the}} Belgian part of the North Sea provides a new habitat to species that could previously not establish in the area. The community {{is dominated by the}} amphipod Jassa herdmani, the hydroids Tubularia larynx and T. indivisa and Actiniaria species, of which the <b>plumose</b> <b>anemone</b> Metridium senile is the most dominant. Only few species, especially those arriving early in the colonization process, are able to establish a viable population. The vertical foundations and the complex three-dimensional structure of the scour protection harbour different fouling communities...|$|E
40|$|In the UK, some of {{the oldest}} oil and gas {{installations}} {{have been in the}} water for over 40 years and have considerable colonisation by marine organisms, which may lead to both industry challenges and/or potential biodiversity benefits (e. g., artificial reefs). The project objective was to test the use of an automated image analysis software (CoralNet) on images of marine biofouling from offshore platforms on the UK continental shelf, with the aim of (i) training the software to identify the main marine biofouling organisms on UK platforms; (ii) testing the software performance on 3 platforms under 3 different analysis criteria (methods Aâ€“C); (iii) calculating the percentage cover of marine biofouling organisms and (iv) providing recommendations to industry. Following software training with 857 images, and testing of three platforms, results showed that diversity of the three platforms ranged from low (in the central North Sea) to moderate (in the northern North Sea). The two central North Sea platforms were dominated by the <b>plumose</b> <b>anemone</b> Metridium dianthus; and the northern North Sea platform showed less obvious species domination. Three different analysis criteria were created, where the method of selection of points, number of points assessed and confidence level thresholds (CT) varied: (method A) random selection of 20 points with CT 80 %, (method B) stratified random of 50 points with CT of 90 % and (method C) a grid approach of 100 points with CT of 90 %. Performed across the three platforms, the results showed that {{there were no significant differences}} across the majority of species and comparison pairs. No significant difference (across all species) was noted between confirmed annotations methods (A, B and C). It was considered that the software performed well for the classification of the main fouling species in the North Sea. Overall, the study showed that the use of automated image analysis software may enable a more efficient and consistent approach to marine biofouling analysis on offshore structures; enabling the collection of environmental data for decommissioning and other operational industries...|$|E
50|$|Members of {{the genus}} Metridium, also known as <b>plumose</b> <b>anemones,</b> are sea anemones found mostly in the cooler waters of the {{northern}} Pacific and Atlantic oceans. They are characterized by their numerous threadlike tentacles extending from atop a smooth cylindrical column, and can vary from a few centimeters in height up to one meter or more. In larger specimens, the oral disk becomes densely curved and frilly.|$|R
50|$|Some anemones feed {{on small}} particles, which are caught {{with the aid}} of a mucus {{secretion}} and moving currents that are set up by the tentacles. These usually have large numbers of tentacles and include the <b>plumose</b> <b>anemones</b> and members of the Stichodactylidae family; Stichodactyla helianthus however is reported to trap sea urchins by enfolding them in its carpet-like oral disc. A few species are parasitic on other marine organisms. One of these is Peachia quinquecapitata, the larvae of which develop inside the medusae of jellyfish, feeding on their gonads and other tissues, before being liberated into the sea as free-living, juvenile anemones.|$|R
40|$|The overabundance of {{one species}} in a {{particular}} area is typically bolstered by a biotic or abiotic factor that allows them to outcompete other species for space and resources. The undersides of the docks in the town of Friday Harbor and at the Friday Harbor Laboratories are overrun with white <b>plumose</b> <b>anemones,</b> Metridium farcimen. The sewage output in the town docks contains particulate matter, which the prey of M. farcimen may feed on. To determine if particulate matter contributes to M. farcimen abundance, I collected specimens from both locations, placed them in controlled tanks and exposed them to separated samples of zooplankton of varying sizes. The anemone did not show an overall preference for food particle size, although they did show a slight preference of 0. 3 mm particles over 0. 5 mm particles. It is possible that they are consuming all size classes of zooplankton that feed on sewage particulates...|$|R
