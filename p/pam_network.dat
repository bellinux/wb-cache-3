40|$|The Joint Airport Weather Studies (JAWS) {{observation}} network used {{at an airport}} in Denver, CO consisted of one S-band and two C-band radars, together with 27 Portable Automated Mesonet (PAM) stations. Each of the three microburst case studies observed during the JAWS experiment occurred within the surface <b>PAM</b> <b>network,</b> and these surface data were compared with the radar analyses. It emerges that if microburst vertical motions are to be accurately resolved, the spacing of the surface stations must be considerably less than 4 km...|$|E

40|$|As current {{authentication}} mechanisms evolve and as new authentication {{mechanisms are}} introduced, system entry {{services such as}} login, rlogin, and telnet must continually be customized to incorporate these changes. With the Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) framework, multiple authentication technologies can be added without changing any of the login services, thereby preserving existing system environments. PAM {{can be used to}} integrate login services with different authentication technologies, such as RSA, DCE, Kerberos, S/Key, and smart card based authentication systems. Thus, <b>PAM</b> enables <b>networked</b> machines to exist peacefully in a heterogeneous environment, where multiple security mechanisms are in place. 1...|$|R
40|$|Two microbursts that {{occurred}} simultaneously and were produced by two neighboring storms on June 22, 1982 {{have been examined}} using Doppler radar analyses and <b>PAM</b> surface <b>network</b> wind observations. The development of the microbursts is described, and the probable importance of forcing mechanisms is considered. It is found that a sounding conductive to deep convection with a very dry, unstable boundary layer gives rise to hail storms which produce microbursts associated with high-reflectivity cores. The two microbursts were associated with intensifying shafts of very high reflectivities. Convergence into the area of downdraft within the dry layer just below the cloud base, evidence of low reflectivity notches {{in the neighborhood of}} the microburst downdrafts, and subsaturated surface conditions in the microburst outflows suggest active evaporation processes may be an important source of energy for these two microbursts...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{neural network}} {{clustering}} algorithm, CoRe, is benchmarked against previously published results on {{a breast cancer}} data set and applying the method of Partition Around Medoids (PAM). The data serve to compare the samples partitions obtained with the neural <b>network,</b> <b>PAM</b> and model-based algorithms, namely Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Variational Bayesian Gaussian Mixture (VBG) and Variational Bayesian Mixtures with Splitting (VBS). It is found that CoRe, on the one hand, agrees with the previously published partitions; on the other hand, it supports {{the existence of a}} supplementary cluster that we hypothesize to be an additional tumor subgroup with respect to those previously identified by PA...|$|R
50|$|On Fox, {{the most}} notable {{personnel}} change was the demotion of <b>Pam</b> Oliver, the <b>network's</b> top sideline reporter for nearly 20 years, to the second broadcast team as Erin Andrews took over the spot on the first broadcast team. 2014 was Oliver's last year covering NFL games for Fox. Other personnel changes include the additions of Donovan McNabb, David Diehl, Kirk Morrison, and Brendan Ayanbadejo to Fox's stable of color commentators, replacing outgoing commentators Tom McCarthy, Brian Billick and Tim Ryan. Brady Quinn also joined the Fox stable. Also briefly joining Fox's play-by-play stable was UFC announcer Mike Goldberg; Goldberg's time doing NFL telecasts was cut short after one game, and he was replaced by Tim Brando, who came over from CBS.|$|R

40|$|Objective. The {{vestibular}} {{system provides}} essential information about balance and spatial orientation via {{the brain to}} other sensory and motor systems. Bilateral vestibular loss significantly reduces quality of life, but vestibular implants (VIs) have demonstrated potential to restore lost function. However, optimal electrical stimulation strategies {{have not yet been}} identified in patients. In this study, we compared the two most common strategies, pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and pulse rate modulation (PRM), in patients. Approach. Four subjects with a modified cochlear implant including electrodes targeting the peripheral vestibular nerve branches were tested. Charge-equivalent PAM and PRM were applied after adaptation to baseline stimulation. Vestibulo-ocular reflex eye movement responses were recorded to evaluate stimulation efficacy during acute clinical testing sessions. Main results. PAM evoked larger amplitude eye movement responses than PRM. Eye movement response axes for lateral canal stimulation were marginally better aligned with PRM than with <b>PAM.</b> A neural <b>network</b> model was developed for the tested stimulation strategies to provide insights on possible neural mechanisms. This model suggested that PAM would consistently cause a larger ensemble firing rate of neurons and thus larger responses than PRM. Significance. Due to the larger magnitude of eye movement responses, our findings strongly suggest PAM as the preferred strategy for initial VI modulation...|$|R
