5|$|For {{many years}} the dodo and the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} were <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> family of their own, the Raphidae (formerly Dididae), because their exact {{relationships with other}} pigeons were unresolved. Each was also <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> monotypic family (Raphidae and Pezophapidae, respectively), as {{it was thought that}} they had evolved their similarities independently. Osteological and DNA analysis has since led to the dissolution of the family Raphidae, and the dodo and solitaire are now placed in their own subfamily, Raphinae, within the family Columbidae.|$|E

5|$|Meat ants {{have been}} {{observed}} blocking banded sugar ant nesting holes with pebbles and soil {{to prevent them from}} leaving their nest during {{the early hours of the}} day. The ants counter this by preventing meat ants from leaving their nest by blocking their nesting holes with debris, a behaviour known as nest-plugging. If meat ant nests are encroached by trees or other shade, banded sugar ants may invade and take over the nest, since the health of the colony may deteriorate from overshadowing. Members of an affected meat ant colony later move to a nearby satellite nest that is <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> suitable area, while invading banded sugar ants fill nest galleries up with a black resinous material. In a 1999 study, Pogonoscopus myrmex leafhoppers were <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> banded sugar ant colony to test the reaction of non-host ants. These leafhoppers were attacked, suggesting no symbiotic relationship between the two.|$|E
