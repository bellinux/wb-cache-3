50|$|During {{their time}} at Dartmouth, the school paper {{published}} a <b>profile</b> on <b>Miller,</b> which {{caught the attention}} of then chairman of Disney Michael Eisner. According to Lord, Eisner brought the profile to the attention of his fellow Disney executives who then offered to set up a meeting with Miller. Miller agreed to the meeting {{as long as he could}} bring Lord. After three months, the two moved to Los Angeles and after one meeting were offered a two-year development deal for Disney Television Animation.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{years later}} Miller joined the modern dance company of Nina Wiener, {{who had studied}} with noted {{choreographer}} Alvin Ailey and {{had been a member}} of the individualistic modern dancer Twyla Tharp's company. Miller performed with Wiener's company for six years, in New York and elsewhere. [...] "Nina made me see how much fun technique could be; she gave me an appetite for making steps," [...] Miller told Dance Magazine. In a <b>profile</b> of <b>Miller</b> for the Brooklyn Academy of Music's publication On the Next Wave, performing arts writer Robert Sandla asserted that even during Miller's early performances, she [...] "was the dancer you watched; quietly intense, wildly imaginative, with quirky musicality, implosive energy, and bold power kept on a very short leash." ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A., Psychology (Counseling Psychology)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. The {{relationship}} between personality and school and job performance {{has been studied}} extensively; however, results of these studies are inconsistent and previous studies have focused almost exclusively on either academic or job performance. The current study examined the {{relationship between}} personality traits as measured by the Personality Research Form, Form E (Jackson, 1974) and attitudes toward school and work as measured by the Goal Orientation Scale (Midgley et al., 1998) and the Multidimensional Work Ethic <b>Profile</b> (MWEP) (<b>Miller,</b> Woehr, & Hudspeth, 2002). Canonical correlation analysis demonstrated that individuals who were less motivated and highly concerned about their reputation had a higher level of desire to avoid demonstrating lack of ability in comparison with others. The current study provides important information relating to attitudes toward school and work and can be utilized for further explorations. Psychology (Counseling Psychology...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} relationships between {{work ethic and}} welfare dependency. The 65 -item Multidimensional Work Ethic <b>Profile</b> (MWEP) (<b>Miller,</b> Woehr, 2 ̆ 6 Hudspeth, 2002) and the 28 -item MWEP (Meriac, Woehr, Gorman, 2 ̆ 6 Thomas, 2013) with attached socioeconomic surveys were administered to n= 338 and n= 247 adult subjects, respectively. A negative correlation between the two variables was anticipated, so that as levels of agreement with work ethic increase, reported use of welfare benefits decrease. After running correlation matrices to examine Pearson’s r, hierarchical regressions were conducted, culminating in a model which partially predicts {{the connection between the}} variables. Bivariate analyses for the 65 -item MWEP data indicated that marital status, age, sex, centrality of work, waste time, delayed gratification, self-reliance, morality/ethics, hard work, and leisure were statistically significantly correlated. Bivariate analyses for the 28 -item MWEP data indicated that centrality of work and hard work were statistically significantly correlated. These findings could be used in the design of a comprehensive assessment tool to be utilized at the point of entry into the welfare system...|$|R
50|$|After {{sorting out}} {{troubles}} with her record companies, Miller released {{an album of}} cover versions in 2002 for the fledgling Melbourne label Raoul Records (run by her husband Ben Lempriere). The album, Car Tape, found Miller in a country-soul vein and was a critical success. As on earlier recordings, Miller's choice of cover songs leant heavily towards cult US male singer/songwriters such as Doug Sahm and Townes Van Zandt. <b>Miller's</b> <b>profile</b> - while still small outside Melbourne's inner-city suburbs - began to grow. A new backing band contained seasoned session musicians, she received multiple ARIA nominations, and Car Tape went on {{to be one of}} the best-selling Australian independent releases of 2002.|$|R
5000|$|Unfortunately {{he settled}} in Bungay, Suffolk, where {{the demand for}} books was small. Moreover, his sturdy {{independence}} lost him the custom {{of many of the}} local magnates. As his son William recorded in a memoir, [...] "Thomas Miller was little suited by nature to the quiet, unambitious life of a country shopkeeper. He possessed a strong & vigorous understanding, with great energy & industry. His mind, which he had improved by much reading, was adapted to a larger sphere - his cramped locality marred his fortune...He had a spirit too independent for the petty aristocracy that surrounds most country towns - his politics never varied or were adapted to his local interests....He had a talent for light poetry but was too fond of lampooning his neighbours when the vein was upon him & he saw a fair opportunity." [...] His stock of books was very valuable, and he had an extensive collection of engraved portraits, and nearly a complete series of Roman and English silver and brass coins. He published catalogues of his collections in 1782 and 1790. In 1795, when the fashion was very general for tradesmen to circulate provincial halfpennies, he had a die cast, but an accident happening to one of the blocks when only twenty-three pieces were struck off, Miller, like a true antiquary, declined having a fresh one made. This coin (which is very finely engraved, and bears a strong <b>profile</b> likeness of <b>Miller)</b> is known to collectors by the name of the 'Miller halfpenny’. As he was careful into whose hands the impressions went, they soon became very rare.|$|R
40|$|Williams {{syndrome}} (WS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder {{caused by}} a submicroscopic deletion of approximately 25 genes on chromosome 7 q 11. 23 (Hillier et al., 2003). This genotype {{is associated with a}} characteristic set of phenotypic features including mild to moderate intellectual disability, a distinctive cognitive profile, facial dysmorphology, common personality traits, cardiovascular problems, and connective tissue disorders (Morris, 2010). In addition, behavioral difficulties such as anxiety symptoms (e. g., Leyfer, Woodruff-Borden, 2 ̆ 6 Mervis, 2009), negative reactivity (e. g., Davies, Udwin, 2 ̆ 6 Howlin, 1998), problems with self-regulation (e. g., Woodruff-Borden, Kistler, Henderson, Crawford, 2 ̆ 6 Mervis, 2010), and sensory modulation difficulties (e. g., John 2 ̆ 6 Mervis, 2010) are common. While anxiety as a behavioral concern for individuals with WS is well-documented, little is known about why these individuals are at an increased risk for this type of problem. Several features of the WS behavioral phenotype have been associated with child anxiety in the general population, specifically negative reactivity (e. g., Lonigan, Phillips, 2 ̆ 6 Hooe, 2003), self-regulation problems (e. g., Eisenberg et al., 2001), and sensory modulation difficulties (e. g., Ben-Sasson, Cermak, Orsmond, Tager-Flusberg, Kadlec, 2 ̆ 6 Carter, 2008). The purpose of this dissertation was to explore the relations of negative reactivity (NR), difficulties with self-regulation (SR), and sensory modulation difficulties (SM) to the increased prevalence of anxiety symptoms in children with WS. Study hypotheses are: (1) The shared variance between NR, SR, and SM will be adequately represented by a single underlying ‘behavioral phenotype’ factor. (2) This factor will share a significant relation with anxiety symptoms in children with WS. Participants were 115 children with WS aged 6 – 10 years. Primary caregivers completed four measures: (1) Children’s Behavior Questionnaire (Rothbart, Ahadi, Hershey, 2 ̆ 6 Fisher, 2001). NR was measured using the Negative Affectivity factor score. (2) Short Sensory <b>Profile</b> (McIntosh, <b>Miller,</b> Shyu, 2 ̆ 6 Dunn, 1999). SM was measured using the Total Sensory Modulation score. (3) Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (Gioia, Isquith, Guy, 2 ̆ 6 Kenworthy, 2000). SR was measured using the Behavioral Regulation Index T-score. (4) Child Behavior Checklist 6 – 18 (Achenbach 2 ̆ 6 Rescorla, 2001). Anxiety symptoms were measured using the DSM-IV Anxiety Problems T-score. Exploratory factor analysis and regression analysis were conducted to test the study hypotheses. The results supported both hypotheses: The WS behavioral phenotype features of negative reactivity, difficulties with sensory modulation, and difficulties with self-regulation were adequately represented by one underlying factor; and this factor explained {{a substantial portion of the}} variance in anxiety symptoms for children with WS aged 6 – 10 years. Implications for future research and treatment of anxiety in children with WS are discussed...|$|R
