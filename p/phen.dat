25|$|Recently, {{researchers}} {{have developed a}} Fe/N/C catalyst derived from iron (II) acetate (FeAc), phenanthroline (<b>Phen),</b> and a metal-organic-framework (MOF) host. The MOF is a Zn(II) zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) called ZIF-8, which demonstrates a high microporous surface area and high nitrogen content conducive to ORR activity. The power density of the FeAc/Phen/ZIF-8-catalyst {{was found to be}} 0.75 W cm−2 at 0.6 V. This value is a significant improvement over the maximal 0.37 W cm−2 power density of previous M/N/C-catalysts and is much closer to matching the typical value of 1-1.2 W cm−2 for Pt-based catalysts with a Pt loading of 0.3mg cm−2. The catalyst also demonstrated a volumetric activity of 230 A cm−3, the highest value for non-PGM catalysts to date, approaching the U.S. Department of Energy milestone.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Suharto {{government}} responded {{to fall in}} oil exports due to the 1980s oil glut by successfully shifting pillar of the economy into export-oriented labour-intensive manufacturing, made globally competitive by Indonesia's low wages {{and a series of}} currency devaluations. Industrialization was mostly undertaken by ethnic-Chinese companies which evolved into immense conglomerates dominating the nation's economy. The largest conglomeracies are the Salim Group led by Liem Sioe Liong (Sudono Salim), Sinar Mas Group led by Oei Ek Tjong (Eka Tjipta Widjaja), Astra Group led by Tjia Han Poen (William Soeryadjaya), Lippo Group led by Lie Mo Tie (Mochtar Riady), Barito Pacific Group led by Pang Djun <b>Phen</b> (Prajogo Pangestu), and Nusamba Group led by Bob Hasan. Suharto decided to support the growth of small number of Chinese-Indonesian conglomerates since they cannot pose political challenge due to their ethnic-minority status, but from his past experience he deemed them to possess the skills and capital needed to create real growth for the country. In exchange for Suharto's patronage, the conglomerates provided vital financing for his [...] "regime maintenance" [...] activities.|$|E
