The band released another EP in 1995, entitled <b>Pain</b> <b>Clinic,</b> and an album in 1997, called In the Blood. Saracen was a Perth band that had formed in 1980. When guitarist John Meyer joined Rose Tattoo in 1983, Saracen replaced him with Jamie Page and {{changed its name}} to Trilogy, releasing two albums (the second of which was recorded after Meyer returned, and issued under the Saracen name). Axatak, who adopted a leather and hair look similar to the early LA glam metal scene and Taipan also released albums or EPs but all of these were generally passed over by the mainstream Australian music scene. Almost Human was an Adelaide band that formed in the late 1970s playing covers before introducing original material. As one of that city's most prominent heavy bands they supported touring groups like Whitesnake, Sweet, Slade and others and eventually released a self-financed single. Guitarist Chris Tennant went on to achieve some success with The Superjesus during the 1990s and other members went on to play in bands like Heaven and BB Steal.|$|E

Methods. This was a qualitative study, based on an interpretative phenomenological approach (IPA). During in-depth interviews in their homes, participants were invited to 'tell their story' from the time their pain began. Participants were twelve male and six female patients, aged between 28 and 62 years, diagnosed as having chronic benign back pain. All had recently attended one of two <b>pain</b> <b>clinics</b> as new referrals. The interview transcripts were analysed thematically. Findings. Stigmatisation emerged as a key theme from the narrative accounts of participants. The findings expose subtle as well as overt stigmatising responses by family, friends, health professionals and the general public which appeared to {{have a profound effect on}} the perceptions, self esteem and behaviours of those interviewed. Conclusions. The findings suggest that patients with chronic back pain feel stigmatised by the time they attend <b>pain</b> <b>clinics</b> and this may affect their attitudes and behaviours towards those offering professional help.

As part of in-depth interviews, participants were invited to ‘tell their story’ from the time their pain began. Participants were twelve male and eight female patients, all of whom were diagnosed as having chronic benign back pain and had recently attended one of two <b>pain</b> <b>clinics</b> as new referrals. The data were analysed thematically. Findings: Loss was one of five major themes to emerge. The narrative accounts revealed a catalogue of socio-economic and other material losses including loss of physical and mental abilities, occupational and social activities, job or role. In those of working age, these led to financial hardship and changes in interpersonal relationships, culminating in loss of self-worth, future and hope. Conclusions: The findings suggest that material losses, as well as perceptions of loss, are prominent issues for those of working age seeking help from <b>pain</b> <b>clinics</b> for chronic back pain, and may need to be acknowledged and addressed as part of therapeutic interventions.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to better understand the role that South Florida <b>pain</b> management <b>clinics</b> may be playing in the abuse and diversion of prescription drugs. This study explores 1) the characteristics and practices of <b>pain</b> <b>clinics</b> that may be facilitating the drug-seeking endeavors of prescription drug abusers and 2) the drug-seeking behaviors of prescription drug abusers who use <b>pain</b> <b>clinics</b> as a primary source for drugs. Thirty in-depth interviews were conducted with prescription drug abusers in South Florida. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and codes were generated based on thematic analyses of the data. Using grounded theory strategies, the analyses revealed six main themes: “pill mills, ” on-site pharmacies, liberal prescribing habits, “sponsoring ” drug diversion, pain doctor/ pharmacy shopping, and falsifying symptoms/documentation. These fi ndings should provide insights for law enforcement, regulatory agencies, and industry as they attempt to develop appropriate policy initiatives and recommendations for best practices...|$|R

Diagnosis is complex and management strategies are associated with various levels of evidence for effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Multidisciplinary pain services {{have been shown to}} be effective in some settings and therefore are recommended by clinical practice guidelines as a rational treatment option to manage these patients. Knowing that these services are resource intensive, evidence is needed to demonstrate their cost-effectiveness. This study aims to describe the management of patients with LBP and FM in two community <b>pain</b> <b>clinics</b> to derive an indicative estimate of cost-effectiveness compared with standard practice. Methods: This is a prospective observational multicenter study, using patient-level data. The data from this study will be combined with modelling of the long-term economic impact of community <b>pain</b> <b>clinics</b> in treating people with LBP and FM. Newly referred patients with LBP and FM who provide written consent will be included. We will collect data on functional disability, pain intensity, quality of life, and health resource utilization. Follow-up data at the 3 - and 6 -month points will be collected by patient-completed questionnaires and health care contact diaries. Health care resource use from diaries will be compared with patient electronic records to assess the agreement between these recording methods. Patient cohort characteristics, treatment pathways, resource use, and outcomes derived from this study will be integrated in a decision analysis model to assess the cost-effectiveness of community <b>pain</b> <b>clinics</b> compared with standard care. This feasibility study will address key methodological issues such as sample estimates and retention rate to inform the design of a future randomized controlled trial.
