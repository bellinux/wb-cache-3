25|$|A {{proportional}} tax is levied by the cantons (at varying rates) on the Eigenkapital (ownership equity) of companies. Thinly capitalised companies are taxed, moreover, on the liabilities that function as equity.

Other foreign creditors are not eligible for a refund; with respect to them, the withholding tax is a genuine tax.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{proportional}} <b>profit</b> <b>taxes</b> on input use is analyzed {{under conditions of}} production uncertainty and risk aversion. Two kinds of <b>profit</b> <b>taxes</b> are considered: proportional <b>profit</b> <b>taxes</b> with perfect loss offset and revenue-neutral <b>profit</b> <b>taxes.</b> Their impact on optimal input use is examined under various forms of production uncertainty, such as the Just-Pope model and the cases of multiplicative and additive uncertainty. It is shown that the structure of risk attitudes, the form of production uncertainty, the underlying (stochastic) technical interdependencies, and the risk-input relations are crucial features in determining the impact of proportional <b>profit</b> <b>taxes</b> on optimal input use.

2500|$|... : Some sources {{claim that}} Hong Kong has a flat tax, though its salary tax {{structure}} has several different rates ranging from 2% to 17% after deductions. Taxes are capped at 15% of gross income, so this rate {{is applied to}} upper income returns if taxes would exceed 15% of gross otherwise. Accordingly, Duncan B. Black of Media Matters for America, says [...] "Hong Kong's 'flat tax' is better described as an 'alternative maximum tax.'" [...] Alan Reynolds of the Cato Institute similarly notes that Hong Kong's [...] "tax on salaries is not flat but steeply progressive."

2500|$|There {{are seven}} current masjids in the Greater Richmond area, with three more {{currently}} in construction, accommodating the growing Muslim population, {{the first one}} being Masjid Bilal. In the 1950s, Muslims from the East End got organized under Nation of Islam (NOI). They used to meet in Temple #24 located on North Avenue. After the NOI split in 1975, the Muslims who joined mainstream Islam, start meeting at Shabaaz Restaurant on Nine Mile Road. By 1976, the Muslims used to meet in a rented church. They tried to buy this church, but due to financial difficulties the Muslims instead bought an old grocery store at Chimbarazoo Boulevard, the present location of Masjid Bilal. Initially, the place was called [...] "Masjid Muhammad #24". Only by 1990 did the Muslims renamed it to [...] "Masjid Bilal". Masjid Bilal {{was followed by the}} Islamic Center of Virginia, ICVA masjid. The ICVA was established in 1973 as a non <b>profit</b> <b>tax</b> exempt organization. With aggressive fundraising, ICVA was able to buy land on Buford road. Construction of the new masjid began in the early 1980s. The rest of the five current masjids in the Richmond area are Islamic Center of Richmond (ICR) [...] in the west end, Masjid Umm Barakah on 2nd street downtown, Islamic Society of Greater Richmond (ISGR) in the west end, Masjidullah in the north side, and Masjid Ar-Rahman in the east end.|$|E

50|$|A {{series of}} {{reductions}} in the <b>profits</b> <b>tax</b> were brought in from 1951 onwards by the new Conservative government. The tax rates fell to 22.5% on distributed profits and 2.5% on undistributed profits by 1957, but the <b>profits</b> <b>tax</b> was no longer income tax-deductible. Derick Heathcoat-Amory's Budget of March 1958 replaced the differential <b>profits</b> <b>tax</b> with a single <b>profits</b> <b>tax</b> measure, applicable to both retained and distributed profits. This gradual decrease, and final abolition, of taxes on capital distributions reflected ideological differences between the Conservative and Labour parties: the Conservative approach was to distribute profits to capital holders for investment elsewhere, while Labour sought to force companies to retain profits for reinvestment in the company in the hope this would benefit the company's workforce.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to income tax, companies were also {{subject to a}} <b>profits</b> <b>tax,</b> which was deducted from company profits when determining the income tax liability. It was a differential tax, with a higher tax rate on dividends (profits distributed to shareholders) than on profits retained within the company. By penalising the distribution of profits, it was hoped companies would retain profits for investment, which was considered a priority after the Second World War. The tax {{did not have the}} desired effect, so the distributed <b>profits</b> <b>tax</b> was increased by 20% by the post-war Labour government to encourage companies to retain more of their profits. At the time of Hugh Gaitskell's 1951 budget, the <b>profits</b> <b>tax</b> was 50% for distributed profits and 10% for undistributed profits.|$|R
