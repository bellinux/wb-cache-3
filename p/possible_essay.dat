40|$|Before the 12 th c. only few texts {{have been}} {{preserved}} from Croatia, Dalmatia, and Slavonia, {{some of them}} of dubious authenticity, showing that communication – including legal acts – was mainly conducted orally. However, several social and cultural changes after the 11 th c. led to innovations in legal practice and documents became the main tool of asserting legal acts like donations, contracts or testaments. This process of advancement of “legal literacy ” (known in German scholarship as Verschriftlichungsprozess) {{was accompanied by a}} more intensive production of liturgical books, thanks to the establishment of new Benedictine monasteries and bishoprics, especially the one in Zagreb. Finally, the emergence of communes stimulated the composition of city statutes and this prevalence of written law as opposed to oral tradition resulted in the writing of the oldest preserved Croatian law, the so called Law of Vinodol. The objective of the lecture is to show how social, demographic, and cultural changes influenced the transformation of early medieval oral culture into the written culture of the High Middle Ages.

40|$|The {{financial}} crises in emerging markets in 1997 - 1999 were preceded by financial liberalisation, rapid surges in capital inflows, {{increased levels of}} indebtedness, and then sudden capital outflows. The study contains four essays that extend the different generations of crisis literature and analyse the role of capital movements and borrowing in the recent crises. Essay 1 extends the first generation models of currency crises. It analyses bond financing of fiscal deficits in domestic and foreign currency, and compares the timing and magnitude of attack with the basic case where deficits are monetised. The essay finds that bond financing may not delay the crisis. But if the country’s indebtedness is low, the crisis is delayed by bond financing, especially if the borrowing is carried out with bonds denominated in foreign currency. Essay 2 extends the second generation model of currency crises by adding capital flows. If these depend negatively on crisis probability, there will be multiple equilibria. The range of country fundamentals for which self-fulfilling crises are possible is wider when capital flows are included, and thus more countries may end up in crisis. An application of the model shows that in 1996 in many emerging economies the fundamentals were inside the range of multiple equilibria and hence self-fulfilling crises were <b>possible.</b> <b>Essay</b> 3 studies financial contagion and develops {{a model of the}} international financial system. It uses a basic model of financial intermediation, but adds several local banks and an international bank. These banks are able to use outside borrowing, the amount of which is determined by the value of their collateral. The essay finds that the use of leverage by local and global banks and the fall in collateral prices comprise an important channel and reason for contagion. Essay 4 analyses the causes of {{financial crises}} in 31 emerging market countries in 1980 – 2001. A probit model is estimated using 23 macroeconomic and financial sector indicators. The essay finds that traditional variables (eg unemployment and inflation) and several indicators of indebtedness (eg private sector liabilities and banks' foreign liabilities) explain currency crises. When the sample was divided into pre- and post-liberalisation periods, the indicators of indebtedness became more important in predicting crisis in the postliberalisation period. currency crises; banking crises; emerging markets; borrowing; collateral; contagion; liberalisation...|$|E

5000|$|This {{effect is}} {{documented}} in FAE research {{in which students}} evaluated a fake debater on attitude and likability based on an essay the [...] "debater" [...] wrote. After being sorted into positive or negative affect groups, participants read one of two <b>possible</b> <b>essays</b> arguing for one side or another on a highly controversial topic. Participants were informed that the debater was assigned a stance {{to take in the}} essay that did not necessarily reflect his views. [...] Still, the positive affect groups rated debaters who argued unpopular views as holding the same attitude expressed in the essay. They were also rated as unlikeable compared to debaters with popular stances, thus, demonstrating FAE. In contrast, the data for the negative affect group displayed no significant difference in ratings for debaters with popular stance and debaters with unpopular stances. These results indicate that positive affect assimilation styles promote fundamental attribution error, and negative affect accommodation styles minimize the error in respect to judging people.|$|R

40|$|Noting the {{resurgence}} of popular and academic interest in epics across disparate media, this essay proposes a theory of the epic genre that transcends particular media and cultures. It seeks to reconcile discussions of the epic in Aristotle, G. W. F.

The epic is, following Gregory Nagy and Franco Moretti, among others, a literary “super-genre” that encompasses as many other kinds of narrative as <b>possible.</b> The <b>essay</b> explains how epic narrative, disembedded from earlier oral poetry, is then situated in new cultural contexts.

40|$|Ruggiero's {{essay on}} Attac, an {{organizational}} acronym that in French stands for "Association for the taxation of financial transactions to help citizens" (in {{reference to the}} Tobin tax), addresses social movements attempting to counter hegemonic globalization. He argues that the term "globalization" has served mainly to legitimate the deregulation of financial markets, and has justified the decline of state powers to regulate capital flows. This process seemed as inevitable as the disempowerment of social movements, which were consequently advised to circumscribe their political possibilities, reducing them to a politics of conserving {{and in some instances}} downright conservative resistance.

Confronting the words and deeds of European founders (at the elite and popular level) with the reflections of post WWII thinkers such as Arendt, Isaiah Berlin, Karl Jaspers and Jürgen Habermas can yield important insights.
