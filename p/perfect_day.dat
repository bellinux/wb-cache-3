Observing tradition the islanders left an open Bible and a small pile of oats in each house, locked all the doors and at 7am boarded the Harebell. Although exhausted by the strain and hard work of the last few days, they were reported to have stayed cheerful throughout the operation. But as the long antler of Dun fell back onto the horizon and the familiar outline of the island grew faint, the severing of an ancient tie became a reality and the St Kildans gave way to tears.|$|E

40|$|Time poverty” touches upon {{a tension}} between the ever {{increasing}} time demands of work and the time needed for people to engage in further, intrinsically meaningful, wellbeing-enhancing activities. At {{the heart of this}} drama is the digital calendar. While often only seen as a useful and quite innocent tool, its functionality and representation subtly enforces certain ways of dealing with time. To counter this, we developed the concept of a benevolent calendar: <b>Perfect</b> <b>Days</b> explicitly cares about the wellbeing-oriented activities of its user. In a study with ve quite busy individuals over three weeks, we found that the majority experienced <b>Perfect</b> <b>Days</b> as positive and acknowledged its goal to change time use for the better. After a phase of irritation, participants felt more aware of their personal time use, adopted new wellbeing-enhancing activities, and in part even already internalized these activities...|$|R
500|$|In 1996, {{following}} the international success of To Bring You My Love and other collaborations, Harvey began composing material {{that would end}} up on her fourth studio album, during what she referred to as [...] "an incredibly low patch." [...] The material diverged significantly from her former work and introduced electronica elements into her song-writing. During recording sessions in 1997 original PJ Harvey Trio drummer Rob Ellis rejoined Harvey's band, and Flood was hired again as producer. The sessions, which continued into April the following year, resulted in Is This Desire? (1998). Though originally released to mixed reviews in September 1998, the album was a success and received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Alternative Music Performance.

500|$|In a July 1951 {{profile in}} Book of the Month Club News, Salinger's friend and New Yorker editor William Maxwell asked Salinger about his {{literary}} influences. Salinger responded: [...] "A writer, when he's asked {{to discuss his}} craft, ought {{to get up and}} call out in a loud voice just the names of the writers he loves. I love Kafka, Flaubert, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Dostoevsky, Proust, O'Casey, Rilke, Lorca, Keats, Rimbaud, Burns, E. Brontë, Jane Austen, Henry James, Blake, Coleridge. I won't name any living writers. I don't think it's right" [...] (although O'Casey was in fact living at the time). In letters written in the 1940s, Salinger had expressed his admiration of three living, or recently deceased, writers: Sherwood Anderson, Ring Lardner, and F. Scott Fitzgerald; Ian Hamilton wrote that Salinger even saw himself for some time as [...] "Fitzgerald's successor". Salinger's [...] "A <b>Perfect</b> <b>Day</b> for Bananafish" [...] has an ending similar to that of Fitzgerald's earlier published short story [...] "May Day".|$|E

[...] Eddy apart, Twain felt ambivalent toward the premise of mind-cure, arguing that [...] "the thing back of it is wholly gracious and beautiful..." [...] while maintaining a healthy skepticism towards the validity of mind cure adding, [...] "These things are true, or they are not. If they were true seventeen and eighteen and nineteen centuries ago {{it would be difficult to}} satisfactorily explain why or how or by what argument that power should be nonexistent in Christians now."< His daughter Clara Clemens became a Christian Scientist and wrote a book about it, Awake to a <b>Perfect</b> <b>Day</b> (1956).|$|E

[...] Of the poems, he said [...] "I have been reading them with delight." [...] Yale poet Edward Rowland Sill, professor at the University of California and a keen critic of American literature, gave Coolbrith a letter of introduction that he wished her to send to publisher Henry Holt.

[...] Quaker poet and former abolitionist John Greenleaf Whittier wrote to Coolbrith from Amesbury, Massachusetts, to share his opinion that her [...] "little volume" [...] of poetry, [...] "which has found such favor with all who have seen it {{on this side of the}} Rocky mountains", should be republished on the East Coast.

500|$|In 1947, {{the author}} {{submitted}} {{a short story}} titled simply [...] "The Bananafish" [...] to The New Yorker. [...] William Maxwell, the magazine's fiction editor, was impressed enough with [...] "the singular quality of the story" [...] that the magazine asked Salinger to continue revising it. He spent a year reworking it with New Yorker editors and the magazine accepted the story, now titled [...] "A <b>Perfect</b> <b>Day</b> for Bananafish", and published it in the January 31, 1948 issue. [...] The magazine thereon offered Salinger a [...] "first-look" [...] contract that allowed them {{right of first refusal}} on any future stories. The critical acclaim accorded [...] "Bananafish", coupled with problems Salinger had with stories being altered by the [...] "slicks", led him to publish almost exclusively in The New Yorker. [...] "Bananafish" [...] was also the first of Salinger's published stories to feature the Glasses, a fictional family consisting of two retired vaudeville performers and their seven precocious children: Seymour, Buddy, Boo Boo, Walt, Waker, Zooey, and Franny. Salinger eventually published seven stories about the Glasses, developing a detailed family history and focusing particularly on Seymour, the brilliant but troubled eldest child.|$|E

After the first lap, I thought the race was over for us. But it was a hard fought race". Tagliani, who finished in second place, stated it was a [...] "good day" [...] for his team and hoped he could continue his recent successes. Third-place finisher Fernández said it was a [...] "great day" [...] for himself and his team but was disappointed as he felt he could have won the race because of a problem at his final pit stop. However, he felt if his team kept building their momentum, and he believed he could challenge for more strong finishes and race victories.

500|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, Salinger had confided {{in a letter}} to Whit Burnett that he was eager to sell the film rights to some of his stories in order to achieve {{financial}} security. According to Ian Hamilton, Salinger was disappointed when [...] "rumblings from Hollywood" [...] over his 1943 short story [...] "The Varioni Brothers" [...] came to nothing. Therefore, he immediately agreed when, in mid-1948, independent film producer Samuel Goldwyn offered to buy the film rights to his short story [...] "Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut". Though Salinger sold his story with the hope—in the words of his agent Dorothy Olding—that it [...] "would make a good movie", the film version of [...] "Wiggily" [...] was lambasted by critics upon its release in 1949. Renamed My Foolish Heart and starring Dana Andrews and Susan Hayward, the melodramatic film departed to such an extent from Salinger's story that Goldwyn biographer A. Scott Berg referred to it as a [...] "bastardization". As a result of this experience, Salinger never again permitted film adaptations to be made from his work. When Brigitte Bardot wanted to buy the rights to [...] "A <b>Perfect</b> <b>Day</b> for Bananafish", Salinger refused the request, but told his friend, Lillian Ross, longtime staff writer for The New Yorker, [...] "She's a cute, talented, lost enfante, and I'm tempted to accommodate her, pour le sport." ...|$|E

At the end of the episode, it is revealed that everything that happened since Maddy was stabbed was actually a dream and that Maddy actually died in Chantelle's attack. This whole episode was Maddy living out her <b>perfect</b> <b>day</b> in her head. On October 21, 2009, Chantelle was admitted to AAU, pregnant after her boyfriend kicked her in the stomach. Despite telling Maria she didn't kill Maddy, she actually confessed to the murder after Mark told her of the consequences about her lying about her boyfriend abusing her and killing Maddy.|$|E
500|$|Contemporary critics {{discuss a}} clear {{progression}} {{over the course}} of Salinger's published work, as evidenced by the increasingly negative reviews received by each of his three post-Catcher story collections. Ian Hamilton adheres to this view, arguing that while Salinger's early stories for the [...] "slicks" [...] boasted [...] "tight, energetic" [...] dialogue, they had also been formulaic and sentimental. It took the standards of The New Yorker editors, among them William Shawn, to refine his writing into the [...] "spare, teasingly mysterious, withheld" [...] qualities of [...] "A <b>Perfect</b> <b>Day</b> for Bananafish" [...] (1948), The Catcher in the Rye, and his stories of the early 1950s. By the late 1950s, as Salinger became more reclusive and involved in religious study, Hamilton notes that his stories became longer, less plot-driven, and increasingly filled with digression and parenthetical remarks. Louis Menand agrees, writing in The New Yorker that Salinger [...] "stopped writing stories, in the conventional sense... He seemed to lose interest in fiction as an art form—perhaps he thought there was something manipulative or inauthentic about literary device and authorial control." [...] In recent years, some critics have defended certain post-Nine Stories works by Salinger; in 2001, Janet Malcolm wrote in The New York Review of Books that [...] "Zooey" [...] "is arguably Salinger's masterpiece... Rereading it and its companion piece [...] "Franny" [...] is no less rewarding than rereading The Great Gatsby." ...|$|E

500|$|On 19 December 2011 it was {{announced}} that a future storyline would see Darren plan his wedding as a surprise to Nancy. It {{was announced}} that Darren would be tempted back into his gambling addiction. Series producer Emma Smithwick commented on the storyline explaining that because Darren was organising the wedding it was [...] "never going to be as smooth as if somebody else was organising it". She added that the wedding was a [...] "long time coming" [...] for the couple but there going to be [...] "a few obstacles in the way", some self-imposed and some caused by external forces. She added that the event would be in [...] "true Darren style". Dawson felt that {{at this point in the}} relationship Darren is [...] "besotted" [...] with Nancy. He explained that Darren feels Nancy is good for him but Darren almost feels undeserving of her. Dawson felt that Nancy was the love of Darren's life. Dawson commented that Darren had [...] "been through the mill" [...] but [...] "for once in his life, Darren is happy". Dawson put this down to Darren getting the Dog in the Pond back and his relationship with Nancy. On why Darren plans the wedding Dawson said: [...] "He wants to show Nancy how much he loves her and thinks a surprise wedding will do that". He explained that due to lack of funds Darren will [...] "have to call in a lot of favours but he hasn't got many friends". Dawson felt that Darren would have to see the idea through to the end, even if Darren would end up [...] "upside-down in mud". On how he felt the wedding would turn out Dawson said that [...] "it could be the tackiest thing ever" [...] but that it would be [...] "hilarious". On the wedding and Darren's feelings, Dawson said that his character is [...] "incredibly excited about it, especially after all the hard work and planning that he's been doing in secret for weeks and weeks". Dawson said that Darren feels like the wedding is [...] "going to be the most <b>perfect</b> <b>day</b> possible and he just can't wait to see the look on Nancy's face when she realises what he's been up to". Dawson went on to add that [...] "things don't go as he planned". Dawson said that he wants the wedding to go ahead, saying [...] "after all this it would be lovely to see them get married, but you never know with soaps. I think they can be happy together". Dawson felt that the pair are the [...] "perfect match and are incredibly sweet together. Darren brings out Nancy's fun side and she gives his life a bit of order". Dawson went on to say he feels the pair are [...] "destined to be the Jack and Vera of Hollyoaks!" [...] Nancy's mother, Margaret Hayton (Darryl Fishwick), arrives in the village. Fox said that Margaret believes Darren is [...] "not good enough for Nancy" [...] so begins trying to split the pair up. Fox said that Margaret tries to [...] "make Nancy doubt her relationship with Darren". Nancy witnesses Darren and Cindy in an embrace which Fox said confirms to Nancy that [...] "everything her mum is saying is true - that Darren doesn't love her and he has been having an affair". When questioned if the pair can get through their troubles Fox said: [...] "I hope so! Myself and Ash have had an awful lot of fun working together, so I'd love to see a 'happily ever after'. Well, as much as it can be happy in soapland!" [...] Fox felt that if Nancy were to discover Darren's plans for their wedding she would be [...] "horrified" [...] although she would [...] "see that he has good intentions". Fox later said that Nancy [...] "really wants to get married, have babies and be happy" [...] with Darren, although Nancy may not ready to be a mother [...] "just yet". [...] Darren and Nancy marry. Dawson explained that Darren felt [...] "relief" [...] that the wedding went ahead as he [...] "often worried that Nancy is too good for him". Dawson commented that he thinks [...] "the characters work well together and they challenge each other all the time. It's quite comical, even when they're arguing. In many ways, Darren is a typical man and Nancy is a typical woman". On how married life will affect the couple Dawson said: [...] "it will change them is by giving a bit of solidity to their relationship. It proves to both of them how much they mean to each other, so if anything, I think it will make them stronger". Explaining why Darren went ahead with planning the surprise wedding Dawson said: [...] "he's got the pub back, he feels like he's learned all his lessons, and he's come full circle. This time around, Darren doesn't want to mess anything up and wants to get everything right. Now that they're married, having children is something that they'll look at in the future".|$|E
