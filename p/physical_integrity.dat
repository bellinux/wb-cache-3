5|$|Scientists at GCI {{viewed the}} CheMin {{instrument}} aboard the Curiosity rover, currently exploring the Gale crater on Mars, as a potentially valuable means to examine ancient {{works of art}} without damaging them. Until recently, only a few instruments were available to determine the composition without cutting out physical samples large enough to potentially damage the artifacts. The CheMin on Curiosity directs a beam of X-rays at particles as small as 400µm and reads the radiation scattered back to determine the composition of an object in minutes. Engineers created a smaller, portable version, named the X-Duetto. Fitting into a few briefcase-sized boxes, it can examine objects on site, while preserving their <b>physical</b> <b>integrity.</b> It is now being used by Getty scientists to analyze a large collection of museum antiques and the Roman ruins of Herculaneum, Italy.|$|E

40|$|This book {{presents}} cutting-edge applications of, and up-to-date research on, {{ontology engineering}} techniques in the <b>physical</b> asset <b>integrity</b> domain. Though {{a survey of}} state-of-the-art theory and methods on ontology engineering, the authors emphasize essential topics including data integration modeling, knowledge representation, and semantic interpretation. The book also reflects novel topics dealing with the advanced problems of <b>physical</b> asset <b>integrity</b> applications such as heterogeneity, data inconsistency, and interoperability existing in design and utilization. With a distinctive focus on applications relevant in heavy industry, Ontology Modeling in <b>Physical</b> Asset <b>Integrity</b> Management is ideal for practicing industrial and mechanical engineers working in the field, as well as researchers and graduate concerned with ontology engineering in physical systems life cycles. This book also: Introduces practicing engineers, research scientists, and graduate students to ontology engineering as a modeling technique applicable in large-scale and complex system engineering Maximizes readers’ understanding of the concepts of physical and plant asset integrity as they affect production and environment sustainability Emphasizes interoperability and interrelation among the different stages of a system life cycle analysis in complex, industrial facilities Features a glossary, a bibliography, and example problems/solutions illustrating applications of ontology engineering in industr...|$|R

25|$|DSM-IV-TR defines trauma {{as direct}} {{personal}} experience {{of an event}} that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury; threat to one's <b>physical</b> <b>integrity,</b> witnessing an event that involves the above experience, learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death, injury experienced by {{a family member or}} close associate, or a state of awareness of something that you usually don't think about, but occurs and leaves you distressed and concerned. Memories associated with trauma are implicit, pre-verbal and cannot be recalled, but can be triggered by stimuli from the in vivo environment. The person's response to aversive details of traumatic event involve intense fear, helplessness or horror. In children it is manifested as disorganized or agitative behaviors.|$|E

40|$|Cadmium is a {{well-known}} elicitor of melatonin synthesis in plants, including rice. However, the mechanisms by which cadmium induces melatonin induction remain elusive. To investigate whether cadmium influences <b>physical</b> <b>integrities</b> in subcellular organelles, we treated tobacco leaves with either CdCl 2 or AlCl 3 and monitored the structures of subcellular organelles—such as chloroplasts, mitochondria, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) —using confocal microscopic analysis. Unlike AlCl 3 treatment, CdCl 2 (0. 5 mM) treatment significantly disrupted chloroplasts, mitochondria, and ER. In theory, the disruption of chloroplasts enabled chloroplast-expressed serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT) to encounter serotonin in the cytoplasm, leading to the synthesis of N-acetylserotonin followed by melatonin synthesis. In fact, the disruption of chloroplasts by cadmium, not by aluminum, {{gave rise to a}} huge induction of melatonin in rice leaves, which suggests that cadmium-treated chloroplast disruption {{plays an important role in}} inducing melatonin in plants by removing physical barriers, such as chloroplast double membranes, allowing SNAT to gain access to the serotonin substrate enriched in the cytoplasm...|$|R
