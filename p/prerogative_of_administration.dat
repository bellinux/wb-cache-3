The ambition {{of this paper is}} two-fold: First, to assess how independent EEAS personnel are when making decisions, thus measuring actor-level autonomy. Secondly, to account for actor-level autonomy by applying two key variables in administrative sciences: bureaucratic structure and geographical location of administrative systems. Benefiting from two new data sets, a survey and elite interviews of EEAS officials, two empirical observations are highlighted. First, EEAS officials demonstrate considerable behavioural independence even against attempts from member-state governments to restrain this. Secondly, the behavioural autonomy of EEAS staff is explained primarily with reference to the supply of organizational capacities inside the EEAS and less by the geographical location of staff. Thus, the bureaucratic structure of the EEAS serves to safeguard bureaucratic autonomy in EU’s new foreign affairs administration. By comparison, the geographical location of EEAS staff is a relatively weak, albeit not absent, signifier of behavioural autonomy...|$|R

40|$|The {{exercise}} {{of the death penalty}} and the operation <b>of</b> the <b>prerogative</b> <b>of</b> mercy in 19 th century Britain have long been a subject of academic scrutiny and popular interest. In comparison, the {{exercise of}} the death penalty and the <b>prerogative</b> <b>of</b> mercy in colonial Australia have been largely overlooked, as has too, the {{exercise of the}} death penalty in respect of female offenders in Britain, and more especially, Australia. This article examines the exercise of the death penalty for the women convicted of a capital offence in the Australia colonies (with particular focus on New South Wales and Tasmania) in the period from 1824 to 1865. This article examines the context <b>of</b> the <b>prerogative</b> <b>of</b> mercy and the perception and treatment of female offenders during this period in Britain and colonial Australia. In considering the rationale and operation <b>of</b> the <b>prerogative</b> <b>of</b> mercy for female capital offenders, it is argued that whilst punishment and deterrence were recurrent themes in the exercise of the death penalty in colonial Australia, these were neither the sole nor even paramount considerations. Instead, the colonial authorities, even to those offenders who were ‘beyond the pale’, regarded the exercise <b>of</b> the <b>prerogative</b> <b>of</b> mercy as fundamental to the <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> criminal justice. However particular considerations applied to female offenders. They were usually viewed in polarised terms that accorded with the wider perception of female offenders in this period, ‘either they are all that's good and virtuous, or that they are depraved and abandoned in the extreme’. [1] Female offenders who were perceived to fall into the former category could expect sympathy and the likelihood of reprieve, whilst those who were perceived, sometimes arbitrarily, to fall into the latter category could entertain little hope of sympathy and mercy and could expect to receive the ‘extreme penalty of the law’.

Through statute approach, researchers will conduct in-depth study of the article of the Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia 1945, and the Act on the <b>prerogative</b> <b>of</b> the President in the appointment and dismissal of the police chief. While the conceptual approach, researchers will study the concepts of the thinking of experts in Constitutional Law related to the <b>prerogative</b> <b>of</b> the President in the appointment and dismissal of the police chief. The results showed that the <b>prerogative</b> <b>of</b> the President in the appointment and dismissal of the Chief of Police is restricted by the requirement for approval of the House of Representatives as a form of checks and balances between state institutions. This is a form of control of the House of Representatives as a representative of all the people of Indonesia who have sovereignty under the Constitution of 1945...|$|R
