Solar energy is the primary source for clean and renewable energy alternative. Currently, the solar energy {{can be converted to}} thermal energy, electricity energy via solar cell and chemical energy via chemical and biological processes. Chemistry and chemical engineering play or will play vital roles in these energy conversion processes. <b>Photocatalytic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> production using solar energy is a promising process for renewable energy production. In the last three decades, a significant effort in <b>photocatalytic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> production has been focused on using UV light which is only less than 5 % in solar spectrum on the earth surface. To convert more solar energy into chemical energy, recent research {{attention has been paid to}} the <b>photocatalytic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> production utilizing visible light 1 - 4. The <b>photocatalytic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> production can be realized from several possible routes: direct water splitting, biomass reforming 5, and reforming of waste compounds 6. The most difficult target is the photocatalytic splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen, which requires the photocatalysts not only absorb solar light but also efficiently convert the photon energy into the chemical energy. Our recent results show that the formation of surface phase junction between anatase and rutile of TiO 2 can greatly enhance the photocatalytic activity possibly due to the separation of photoexcited hole-electron by the surface junction structure 7. The activity of photocatalytic H 2 production can be significantly enhanced when small amount of MoS 2 is loaded on CdS as co-catalyst 4. The rate of H 2 evolution is increased by up to 36 times when CdS was loaded with only 0. 2 wt% of MoS 2, and the activity of MoS 2 /CdS is even higher than those of the CdS photocatalysts loaded with different noble metals, such as Pt, Ru, Rh, Pd and Au. The junction formed between MoS 2 and CdS and the excellent H 2 activation property of MoS 2 are supposed to be responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of MoS 2 /CdS. Recently, extremely high quantum efficiency (QE) for H 2 production has been achieved over Pt–PdS/CdS photocatalysts 8. The Pt–PdS/CdS catalyst demonstrates the possibility of realizing visible-light-responsive <b>photocatalytic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> production with a QE approaching the level of natural photosynthesis. The strategy to achieve high QE by co-loading suitable dual cocatalysts, especially those functioning as oxidation and reduction cocatalysts, respectively, will be of considerable importance in the design and preparation of highly active photocatalysts for solar energy conversion.

A recent computational study (using the hybrid DFT method) of doping SrTiO 3 with metal cations coupled with experimental study showed that co-doping Cr and La ions had considerable enhancement effect on hydrogen production of water/methanol solution [11].
