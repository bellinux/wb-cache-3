In 1931 she was called upon by the Ministry of Agriculture in Lisbon to establish Portugal's Plant Quarantine Services (Servicos de Inspeccao Fitopatologica). Bensaude’s expertise in pests and pathogens of economically important crops such as pineapple, potato, garlic, wheat and onion led to many significant publications for the control, prevention, and treatment of plant diseases in Portugal. Notable pathogens studied by Bensaude include Sychytrium endobacterium (potato wart), Clavibacter sependonicum (<b>potato</b> <b>ring</b> <b>rot),</b> and a species of Phytophthora on citrus (Mota, 2008; Ainsworth, 1976; Jones, 1972).|$|E

The aim {{of our research}} is to ascertain the composition and structure of Clavibacter michiganensis subspecies sepedonicus exopolysaccharides. Exopolysaccharides of Clavibacter michiganensis subspecies sepedonicus are determined to consist of 4 - 6 anionic and neutral components which have molecular weights from 700 kDa. Glucose is a major monomer of polysaccharides and arabinose, rhamnose and mannose are minor monomers. Glucose is present in α-Dglucopyranose and β-D-glucopyranose configurations. Calcium is determined to be a component of exopolysaccharides.

Influence of silver nanocomposites on cellular respiration which was estimated on oxygen absorption speed is also investigated.

As the agents feasible for use in this purpose, we examined the selenium nanocomposites obtained from the macrobasidiomycetes' submerged cultures. For exploring the bionanocomposites effect on Cms, the methods of agar well diffusion, the suspension turbidity measurement, and the colony-forming units count were applied. The results showed that all the nanocomposites under study lowered the bacterial suspension's absorption values compared to the reference specimen, that testified to the observation of bacteriostatic effect of the agents tested. The suppression action of nanocompostes was elucidated by means of both agar well diffusion assay and colony-forming units count.

40|$|Synthesis on {{the basis}} of natural {{matrices}} in order to acquire products with the desired properties is one of the promising trends of modern science. Using polysaccharides as a matrix allowed to generate derivatives with diverse structures and new properties. Growing interest towards anti-microbe effect of selenium-containing nano-composites is induced by the phenomenon of antibiotic-resistance of contemporary pathogenic microorganisms. Clavibacter genus bacteria are the most significant and widely spread among gram-positive bacteria. Bacteria cells are static pleimorphous rods, normally singular, sometimes coupled or joined in short chains, strict anaerobes in need of certain growth factors, non-sporogenous. Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus cause <b>potato</b> <b>ring</b> <b>rot.</b> At the tuber slice the damage is shaped as a ring; growing bacteria are accumulated in the conducting vessels causing their occlusion and therefore gradual withering of leaves and stem. This disease is distributed at all the continents including Australia. Harvest loss through ring rot damage may reach 10 - 45 %. Our work was aimed at the study of complex interaction between microbe cultivar and selenium-based nanocomposites. Bacterial strain Аs 1405 was acquired from the All-Russia collection of microorganisms, IMBP RAS. This genus is not included in the classification of pathogenic microorganisms by pathogenic groups of Sanitary-Epidemiological Rules SP 1. 3. 2322 - 08. The present study was focused on characteristics of the acquired strain. Fluorescent and electronic-scanning microscope was used to acquire photographs of bacterial cells. Pathogen was identified by PCR-analysis, which confirmed the presence of DNA of desired size. The extracted DNA was sequenced with the sequenced sequence added to Gen Bank under the number HQ 394204. Cellulolytic and phytotoxic activity of this strain was determined. Chemistry Institute named A. E. Favorsky provided water-soluble nano-composites containing selenium stabilized by various polymers.

In low resistant cultivar temperature changes {{did not cause}}d changes in weakassociated with wall cell peroxidase activity. Pathogen influence did not cause changes in its activity in these conditions too. At the same time pathogen actively grew under low temperature conditions, but at 38 0 C the increase of bacterial cell number was detected only during the first five days of experiment, but after this date bacterial cell began perishes. In resistant cultivar temperature increase caused some increase of peroxidase activity. Temperature decrease caused the decrease of peroxidase activity, but following pathogen addition caused increase of weak-associated with wall cell peroxidase activity. In high temperature conditions pathogen addition caused significant increase of peroxidase activity during the first minutes after pathogen addition (because of changes in peroxidase molecule activity) and after 1. 5 - 2 h of incubation (because of changes in genome expression and peroxidase synthesis).

40|$|Members of the {{actinomycete}} genus Clavibacter {{are known}} to produce antimicrobial compounds, but so far none of these compounds has been purified and characterized. We have isolated an antimicrobial peptide, michiganin A, from the tomato pathogen Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, using ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by cation-exchange and reversed-phase chromatography steps. Upon chemical derivatization of putative dehydrated amino acids and lanthionine bridges by alkaline ethanethiol, Edman degradation yielded sequence information {{that proved to be}} sufficient for cloning of the gene by a genome-walking strategy. The mature unmodified peptide consists of 21 amino acids, SSSGWLCTLTIECGTIICACR. All of the threonine residues undergo dehydration, and three of them interact with cysteines via thioether bonds to form methyllanthionine bridges. Michiganin A resembles actagardine, a type B lantibiotic with a known three-dimensional structure, produced by Actinoplanes liguriae, which is a filamentous actinomycete. The DNA sequence of the gene showed that the michiganin A precursor contains an unusual putative signal peptide with no similarity to well-known secretion signals and only very limited similarity to the (only two) available leader peptides of other type B lantibiotics. Michiganin A inhibits the growth of Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus, the causal agent of ring rot of potatoes, with MICs in the low nanomolar range.

A comprehensive bioeconomic model that considers the exclusion, detection and control of multiple NIS spreading by stratified dispersal and presenting Allee effects was developed and applied to manage the simultaneous risk posed by Colorado beetle, the bacterium causing <b>potato</b> <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> and western corn rootworm in the UK. A genetic algorithm was used to study the optimal management under uncertainty. Optimal control methods were used to interpret and verify the genetic algorithm solutions. The results show that government agencies should allocate less exclusion and more control resources to NIS characterised by Allee effects, low rate of satellite colonies generation and that present low propagule pressure. The prioritisation of NIS representative of potential NIS assemblages increases management efficiency. The adoption of management measures based on the risk analysis of a single NIS might not correspond to the optimal allocation of resources when other NIS share a common limited budget.

Plasmids pDM 302, pHN 205, and pHN 216 were stably maintained without antibiotic selection in various strains of C. michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus. We observed that for a single plasmid, different strains of C. michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus showed significantly different transformation efficiencies.

Strain 9001 showed obvious antagonistic activity to B. dothidea YL- 1 when plated on potato dextrose agar. Soaking healthy apples in the bacterial suspensions of strain 9001 prior to artificial inoculation of fungal pathogen resulted in a dramatic decrease in disease incidence when compared to the control. Moreover, either field application in the growth season or postharvest treatment of apples from infected orchards with bacterial suspensions of strain 9001 resulted in significantly reduced disease incidence within the storage period for 4 months at room temperature.

40|$|The <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> {{disease of}} <b>potato,</b> {{caused by the}} Gram-positive bacterium, Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. {{sepedonicus}} (Cms), is under good regulatory control in Canada. With a zero tolerance for the disease in seed potato production, and a certification requirement for annual laboratory indexing of selected seed lots for the possible presence of asymptomatic latent infections, occurrences of bacterial <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> are infrequent and limited in scope. The laboratory indexing requirement {{is considered to be}} a particularly important component of the seed certification program for <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> control, because the disease, when first present, is, under Canadian production conditions, often not detected by field inspection of growing crops or by bin inspection of harvested tubers, and will be of increasing importance should changing climatic conditions impact negatively on symptom expression. In Canada, the primary test for laboratory indexing is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a monoclonal antibody targeting the Cms extracellular polysaccharide, followed by a somatic antigen-directed monoclonal antibody-based immunofluorescence (IMF) confirmatory test for ELISA positive samples. A real-time (kinetic) PCR test (kPCR) using TaqMan chemistry, adapted from a published method and supplemented with an internal reaction control (RC) was implemented to evaluate the efficiency of the serological methods. The RC was constructed from a corn invertase gene fragment flanked by sequences complementary to the Cms primers, and was designed to generate an amplicon that differed from the Cms-specific amplicon but by its amplification would confirm the absence of PCR inhibitory substances in template DNA. The RC construct was cloned into plasmid vector pCRII-TOPO (to create plasmid, pCmsC 4) and propagated in Escherichia coli strain DHá-T 1. The RC amplicon did not hybridize to the Cms-specific TaqMan probe, but could be detected in kPCR runs with the inclusion of SYBR Green in the reaction mix. The Cmsspecific and the RC amplicons were readily distinguished by their respective postamplification melting temperatures in the presence of SYBR Green. The addition of 100 copies of pCmsC 4 to the reaction mix did not adversely affect sensitivity of Cms detection by kPCR. The presence of Cms in all ELISA/IMF-positive samples was confirmed by kPCR. However, in a 320 -sample data set, 50 % of ELISA-positive samples with cell counts below the IMF threshold were positive by kPCR, verifying the applicability of kPCR as a valuable additional confirmatory test. In the same data set, 16 % of samples that had both ELISA and IMF readings below the positive thresholds were positive by kPCR.

Chemical composition analysis identified a total of 26 components in Fr. 3. The main constituents of Fr. 3 were alkanes (80. 97 %), esters (5. 24 %), acids (4. 87 %) and alcohols (2. 21 %). Antimicrobial activity of Fr. 3 against C. michiganense subsp. sepedonicum could be attributed to its ability to damage the cell wall and cell membrane, induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increase cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration, inhibit the glycolytic pathway (EMP) and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, inhibit protein and nucleic acid synthesis, and disrupt the normal cycle of DNA replication. These findings indicate that L. japonica extracts have potential for inhibiting C. michiganense subsp. sepedonicum...|$|R
40|$|The Polygonum orientale L. {{extracts}} {{were investigated}} for antibacterial activity against Clavibater michiganense subsp. sepedonicum (Spieckermann & Kotthoff) Davis et al., the causal agent {{of a serious}} disease called bacterial <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> of <b>potato.</b> The {{results showed that the}} leaf extracts of P. orientale had significantly (p< 0. 05) greater antibacterial activity against C. michiganense subsp. sepedonicum than root, stem, flower extracts in vitro. According to the results of single factor experiments and L(27) 3 (13) orthogonal experiments, optimum extraction conditions were A 1 B 3 C 1, extraction time 6 h, temperature 80 °C, solid to liquid ratio 1 ∶ 10 (g:mL). The highest (p< 0. 05) antibacterial activity was observed when pH was 5, excluding the effect of control. The extracts were stable under ultraviolet (UV). In vivo analysis revealed that 50 mg/mL of P. orientale leaf extracts was effective in controlling decay. Under field conditions, 50 mg/mL of P. orientale leaf extracts also improved growth parameters (whole plant length, shoot length, root length, plant fresh weight, shoot fresh weight, root fresh weight, dry weight, and number of leaves), in the 2010 and 2011 two growing seasons. Further solvent partition assays showed that the most active compounds were in the petroleum ether fractionation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed drastic ultrastructural changes caused by petroleum ether fractionation, including bacterial deformation, electron-dense particles, formation of vacuoles and lack of cytoplasmic materials. These results indicated that P. orientale extracts have strong antibacterial activity against C. michiganense subsp. sepedonicum and a promising effect in control of bacterial <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> of <b>potato</b> disease...|$|R
