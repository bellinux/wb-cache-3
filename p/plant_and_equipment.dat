5|$|Not all tramway {{companies}} were purchased, as the Glenelg to Marino company continued operating separately until its failure in 1914. The government purchased the properties, <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> of existing tramways {{but did not}} purchase the companies themselves. The equipment included 162 trams, 22 other vehicles and 1,056 horses.

5|$|Owers' Corner {{was named}} after Lieutenant Noel Owers, who was given the task of {{surveying}} a new route from Ilolo to Nauro. The project of constructing a jeep track to Nauro was pushed aggressively by the Chief Engineer at New Guinea Force, Brigadier John Main. Lieutenant Colonel Sidney Bleechmore was placed in charge, and was given the 7th and 2/14th Field Companies and {{a section of the}} 2/1st Mechanical Equipment Company. Work commenced on 19 August. Removing the trees allowed the sun to dry out the ground, and by adding drainage, a track was created passable by light vehicles, allowing <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> to be brought up. Owers' Corner was reached in early September.|$|E

25|$|While the {{specific}} <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> utilized by Lawrence & Foulks is not known, wooden shipbuilding firms {{in this era}} could be established for a remarkably small outlayas little as $11,000, and rarely more than $20,000. Tradesmen at this time mostly supplied their own tools, so a shipyard needed {{little more than a}} waterfront property large enough to hold a timber yard and a slipway or two, a derrick to lift heavy components, a large crosscut saw and a few other tools.|$|E
25|$|By 1867, the Allaire Iron Works {{had only}} one engine and one boiler on its books.

25|$|On {{the supply}} side of the market, some factors of {{production}} are described as (relatively) variable in the short run, which affects the cost of changing output levels. Their usage rates can be changed easily, such as electrical power, raw-material inputs, and over-time and temp work. Other inputs are relatively fixed, such as <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> and key personnel. In the long run, all inputs may be adjusted by management. These distinctions translate to differences in the elasticity (responsiveness) of the supply curve in the short and long runs and corresponding differences in the price-quantity change from a shift on the supply or demand side of the market.|$|E
25|$|Well before 1976, Venezuela {{had taken}} several {{steps in the}} {{direction}} of nationalization of its oil industry. In August 1971, under the presidency of Rafael Caldera, a law was passed that nationalized the country's natural gas industry. Also in 1971 the law of reversion was passed which stated that all the assets, <b>plant,</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> belonging to concessionaires within or outside the concession areas would revert to the nation without compensation upon the expiration of the concession. The movement towards nationalism was experienced once again under decree 832. Decree 832 stipulated that all exploration, production, refining, and sales programs of the oil companies had to be approved in advance by the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons.|$|E
25|$|Cadillac {{was formed}} from the {{remnants}} of the Henry Ford Company. After a dispute between Henry Ford and his investors, Ford left the company along with several of his key partners in March 1902. Ford's financial backers William Murphy and Lemuel Bowen called in engineer Henry M. Leland of Leland & Faulconer Manufacturing Company to appraise the <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> in preparation for liquidating the company's assets. Instead, Leland persuaded the pair to continue manufacturing automobiles using Leland's proven single-cylinder engine. A new company called the Cadillac Automobile Company was established on 22 August 1902, re-purposing the Henry Ford Company factory at Cass Street and Amsterdam Avenue. It was named after French explorer Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac, who had also founded Detroit in 1701.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1950s China {{imported}} Soviet <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> for {{the development}} program of the First Five-Year Plan (1953–57). At the same time, the Chinese government expanded exports of agricultural products to repay loans that financed the imports. Total trade peaked at the equivalent of US$4.3 billion in 1959, but a sudden decline in agricultural production in 1959-61 required China's leaders to suspend further imports of machinery to purchase foreign grain. Under a policy of [...] "self-reliance," [...] in 1962 total trade declined to US$2.7 billion. As the economy revived in the mid-1960s, <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> again were ordered from foreign suppliers, and substantial growth in foreign trade was planned. But in the late 1960s, {{the activities of the}} Cultural Revolution (1966–76) caused trade again to decline.|$|R

25|$|Unlike the {{economic}} booms of the 1960s and 1970s, when increasing exports played the {{key role in}} economic expansion, domestic demand propelled the Japanese economy in the late 1980s. This development involved fundamental economic restructuring, moving from dependence on exports to reliance on domestic demand. The boom that started in 1986 was generated by the decisions of companies to increase private <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> spending and of consumers {{to go on a}} buying spree. Japan's imports grew at a faster rate than exports. Japanese post-war technological research was carried out for the sake of economic growth rather than military development. The growth in high-technology industries in the 1980s resulted from heightened domestic demand for high-technology products such as electronics, and for higher living, housing, and environmental standards; better medical care and more welfare; expanded leisure-time facilities; and improved ways to accommodate a rapidly aging society.|$|E
25|$|The Capehart Amendment put intense {{pressure}} on the Truman administration's inflation program. On August 8, the federal government imposed stricter economic controls on the economy. In the steel industry, production quotas and procurement orders were extended to all civilian steelmakers, not just large manufacturers. Steel companies had reported record and near-record profits in the summer, but by mid-fall net revenues were down as defense needs consumed larger and larger quantities of raw and finished steel and steelmakers were unable to sell steel to the higher-margin civilian market. On September 4, DPA again increased the amount of steel needed for defense use, sharply scaling down allotments for the civilian economy. When steelmakers balked at expanding <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> {{in order to meet}} new defense quotas, ODM officials ordered the chief executives of the nation's largest steel manufacturers to attend a meeting in Washington where they were threatened with additional government regulation and oversight. The steelmakers quickly acceded to the government's demands.|$|E

Simović had previously served as second-in-command of the VVKJ. There were few developments of note during the year, with the obsolete fleet continuing to decline, and even the state aircraft factory at Kraljevo was largely idle except {{for the production of}} spare parts for the large number of Breguet 19 aircraft still in service. The Ikarus and Zmaj factories at Zemun installed <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> for the production of the Hawker Fury under licence, but the delivery of the ten purchased aircraft was not expected until March 1937, and it was not expected that any of the locally made aircraft would be delivered until May of that year. Ikarus also produced several Avia BH-33E fighters, and overhauled a large number of Potez 25 aircraft during the year. A prototype Dornier Do 17 light bomber with Gnome-Rhône engines was ordered, with a further order for nineteen more aircraft pending a successful trial.|$|E

500|$|The two forward saloons were {{arranged}} in a similar plan to the after saloons, with the upper [...] "promenade" [...] saloon having 36 berths per side and the lower 30, totalling 132. Further forward, separate from the passenger saloons, were the crew quarters. The overall finish of the passenger quarters was unusually restrained for its time, a probable reflection of the proprietors' diminishing capital reserves. Total cost of construction of the ship, not including £53,000 for <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> to build her, was £117,000—£47,000 more than her original projected price tag of £70,000.|$|E
