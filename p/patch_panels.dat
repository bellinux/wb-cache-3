25|$|Scott {{developed}} {{some of the}} first devices capable of producing a series of electronic tones automatically in sequence. He later credited himself as being the inventor of the polyphonic sequencer. (It should be noted that his electromechanical devices, some with motors moving photocells past lights, bore little resemblance to the all-electronic sequencers of the late sixties.) He began working on a machine he said composed using artificial intelligence. The Electronium, as Scott called it, with its vast array of knobs, buttons and <b>patch</b> <b>panels</b> is considered the first self-composing synthesizer.|$|E
500|$|Syro is an {{electronic}} music album. All 12songs {{on the album}} were written by James in-studio. According to James, the songs were written over an extended period; Syro features both archived and more recent compositions, with the album's oldest track around [...] "six or seven years old". The album was recorded in six different studios, including James' own studio in Scotland, which he spent three years building and which was completed in 2006. One audio engineer spent three months with James, helping him wire together <b>patch</b> <b>panels</b> and [...] "then [...] realized {{he was doing it}} all wrong and had to start again". Describing the overall process as [...] "brutal", James referred to the in-studio technical issues as the catalyst for writing new music that would be featured on Syro.|$|E

50|$|Structured cabling {{design and}} {{installation}} {{is governed by}} a set of standards that specify wiring data centers, offices, and apartment buildings for data or voice communications using various kinds of cable, most commonly category 5e (CAT5e), category 6 (CAT6), and fiber optic cabling and modular connectors. These standards define how to lay the cabling in various topologies {{in order to meet the}} needs of the customer, typically using a central <b>patch</b> <b>panel</b> (which is normally 19 inch rack-mounted), from where each modular connection can be used as needed. Each outlet is then patched into a network switch (normally also rack-mounted) for network use or into an IP or PBX (private branch exchange) telephone system <b>patch</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|R

5000|$|When the [...] "automatically {{switched}} optical patch panel" [...] finds {{a failure}} in the IX switch, it switches patch cable to the other IX switch automatically.

40|$|Ubiquitous {{computing}} environments accrete {{slowly over}} time rather than springing into existence all at once. Mechanisms {{are needed for}} incremental integration— {{the problem of how}} to incrementally add or modify behaviors in existing ubicomp environments. Examples include adding new input modalities and choreographing the behavior of existing independent applications. The iROS Event Heap, via its publish-subscribe coordination mechanism, provides the foundation for interoperation through event intermediation, but does not directly provide facilities for expressing these intermediations. The <b>Patch</b> <b>Panel</b> provides a general facility for retargeting event flow. Intermediations can be expressed as simple event translation mappings or as more complex finitestate machines. We describe an implemented prototype of the <b>Patch</b> <b>Panel,</b> including examples of its use drawn from real life applications in production use in the iRoom ubiquitous computing environment. 1...|$|R
