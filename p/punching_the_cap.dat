50|$|The grape {{harvest is}} done when the grapes are ripe and is done {{manually}} or mechanically. The manual harvest {{is for the}} most part sorted, either at the vineyard or at the cellar with a sorting table, thereby removing the rotten grapes or insufficiently mature ones. The manual harvest is usually broken and then placed in vats. Cold pre-fermentation maceration is sometimes carried out. The fermentation can now begin, usually after the application of yeast. Then begins the work of extracting the polyphenols (tannins, anthocyanins) and other qualitative aspects of the grape (polysaccharides etc.). The extraction is done by pigeage, an operation which consists in <b>punching</b> <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> into the fermenting juice using a wooden tool or nowadays a hydraulic system. More commonly, the extraction is conducted by reassemblies, an operation which involves pumping the juice {{from the bottom of the}} tank to water the cap and thus wash away the qualitative components of the grapes. The fermentation temperature may be higher or lower depending on the practices of each winemaker with an average of 28° to 35° at fermentation peak. Chaptalization is carried out if the natural alcohol content is not enough: this process is regulated. The alcoholic fermentation is followed by racking which produces free-run wine and press wine. The malolactic fermentation takes place after, but it is temperature-dependent. The wine is racked and placed in barrels or tanks for maturing. The maturing continues for several months (12 to 24 months) and the wine is refined, filtered and bottled.|$|E

5000|$|As soon as {{the grapes}} arrive at the winery, they are sorted and destemmed. After destemming, the grapes are then delicately pressed, just to break the skins, and this must be {{immediately}} transferred to temperature-controlled, stainless-steel vats that hold between 1,585 and 3,170 gallons. These specialized vats are divided into two separate tanks stacked {{on top of one}} another. The top tank is the first stop for the grapes - they are chilled down to [...] for a two-day cold soak, and natural fermentation begins gently, as the temperatures rise after the cold soak. The gradual increase in temperature results in more complex flavors in the finished wine. This top tank is also equipped with pistons to gently <b>punch</b> down <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> from above. Once enough color and flavor have been extracted, the juice is separated from the must, by gravity, and goes to the bottom tank to finish fermentation.|$|R

The variables involved were spacing of piles, arrangement of reinforcement, side length of column. side length of pile cap {{and depth of}} pile caps For all pile caps final failure was in shear. In the shear failure three typical forms were recorded. The first was <b>the</b> <b>punching</b> fai lure by <b>the</b> column <b>punching</b> through <b>the</b> pile <b>cap.</b> <b>The</b> second was the one {{similar to that in}} a wide beam, with <b>the</b> pile <b>cap</b> splitting into halves which were dis-placed vertically relative to one another. The third was the shearing failure in which the corners of pile cap were broken off. In regard to the ultimate shearing strength the results of the test were compared with the values calcuated according to the provision for the shear in A. I. J. Building Code Requirements for Reinforced Concrete(1982), to that in A. C. I.

40|$|Engineered covers {{have been}} placed on top of buried/subsurface wastes to {{minimize}} water infiltration and therefore, release of hazardous contaminants. In order for the cover {{to protect the environment}} it must remain free of holes and breaches throughout its service life. Covers are subject to subsidence, erosion, animal intrusion, plant root infiltration, etc., all of which will affect the overall performance of the cover. The U. S. Department of Energy Environmental Management (DOE-EM) Program 2006 Accelerated Cleanup Plan is pushing for rapid closure of many of the DOE facilities. This will require a great number of new cover systems. Some of these new covers are expected to maintain their performance for periods of up to 1000 years. Long-term stewardship will require monitoring/verification of cover performance {{over the course of the}} designed lifetime. In addition, many existing covers are approaching the end of their design life and will need validation of current performance (if continued use is desired) or replacement (if degraded). The need for a reliable method of verification and long-term monitoring is readily apparent. Currently, failure is detected through monitoring wells downstream of the waste site. This is too late as the contaminants have already left the disposal area. The proposed approach is the use of gaseous Perfluorocarbon tracers (PFT) to verify and monitor cover performance. It is believed that PFTs will provide a technology that can verify a cover meets all performance objectives upon installation, be capable of predicting changes in cover performance and failure (defined as contaminants leaving the site) before it happens, and be cost-effective in supporting stewardship needs. The PFTs are injected beneath the cover and air samples taken above (either air samples or soil gas samples) at the top of the cover. The location, concentrations, and time of arrival of the tracer(s) provide a direct measure of cover performance. PFT technology can be used as a non-invasive method (if injection ports are emplaced prior to cover emplacement) on new covers or a minimally invasive method on existing covers. PFT verification will be useful at all buried waste sites using a cover system (e. g., treated or untreated chemical waste landfills) including DOE, commercial, and private sector sites. This paper discusses the initial field trial of the PFT cover monitoring system performed at the Savannah River Site (SRS) in FY 01. The experiments provided a successful proof-of-principle test of the PFT technology in monitoring caps and covers. An injection and sampling array was installed in <b>the</b> Bentomat test <b>cap</b> at <b>the</b> SRS <b>Caps</b> Test Facility. This system contained 6 feet of sandy soil beneath a 1 / 2 inch geosynthetic clay liner covered by an HDPE liner which was covered by 2 feet of clayey top soil. PFTs were injected into the sandy soil though a pre-existing system of access pipes below <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> and soil gas samples were taken on top of <b>the</b> <b>cap.</b> Mid-way into <b>the</b> injection period a series of 1 1 / 2 inch holes were <b>punched</b> into <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> (through <b>the</b> geomembrane) to provide a positive breach in <b>the</b> <b>cap.</b> Data will be presented that shows <b>the</b> initial <b>cap</b> was fairly tight and leak free and that the artificially induced leaks were detectable within two hours of occurrence...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} {{compaction}} of pharmaceutical powders using different shapes of punches. We introduce {{a model of}} mechanical behaviour Drucker-Prager <b>Cap</b> (DPC), using <b>the</b> approach of compressible continuous media. The model parameters that are depending on the material density, were identified from experimental data and a calibration process was applied on Microcrystalline Cellulose (MCC) powder. In addition, the mathematical formulation of the boundary problem of compaction in rigid tools brings back to an optimization problem with constraint, which is solved by finite element method. <b>The</b> Drucker-Prager <b>Cap</b> model, which is implemented in Abaqus/Standard software, was employed using a user subroutine, USDFLD. Three kinds of typical pharmaceutical tablets are considered: flat-face tablet and concave face tablet with two different depths. Results of simulations of die compaction cycle as compression, decompression and ejection, reproduce the powder compaction process for <b>the</b> studied shaped <b>punches.</b> <b>The</b> effects of <b>the</b> <b>punch's</b> shape on <b>the</b> compaction process were observed on the distribution and the maximum of stress and density in the compact. Examination of the density gradient according to the shape, suggests a capping tendency, which increases with <b>the</b> <b>punch</b> depth. This study illustrates the potentiality of the FEM method, {{which could be used}} as an efficient tool to predict the density and the stress distributions into shaped compacts and to provide a diagnostic of <b>the</b> <b>capping</b> problems...|$|R

2500|$|Proper {{accessories}} to wear {{with the}} frock coat included a non-collapsible top {{hat and a}} boutonnière in the lapel. A Homburg hat was considered too informal to wear with proper formal morning dress. During the Victorian and Edwardian era, button boots with a single row of <b>punching</b> across <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> toe were worn along with a cane. [...] On cold days, it was common to wear a frock overcoat, a type of overcoat cut {{exactly the same as}} the frock coat, with the waist seam construction, only a little longer and fuller to permit it to be worn {{over the top of the}} frock coat. Patent leather dress boots were worn up until the Edwardian era with morning dress. The practice of wearing patent leather shoes is today reserved strictly for evening formalwear. [...] Trousers are uncuffed and worn with braces (suspenders in American English) to avoid the top of the trousers from showing underneath the waistcoat. Only white shirts were worn with frock coats. The shirt was worn with a standing detachable collar. The most standard neckwear was a formal cravat (or Ascot in American English). The cravat was tied in the Ascot knot (the entire cravat is called an Ascot in American English) characterised by way the ends cross over in front, or alternatively in a Ruche knot, tied like a four-in-hand knot of a modern necktie. A decorative cravat pin often adorned with a precious stone or pearl was used to keep the cravat tidy. The cravat was usual with a frock coat when worn in more formal occasions through the Victorian and Edwardian eras, although the long necktie came to be worn increasingly after the turn of the century in the same manner as it is today with morning dress. The practice of wearing bow ties as an acceptable alternative with formalwear fell away after the late Victorian to early Edwardian era and became relegated to eveningwear, as remains the case in the twenty-1st century. As with a formal shirt for white tie, cuffs were single (rather than double) cuffed and made to close with cufflinks. The waistcoat was usually double-breasted with double-breasted style (or peaked) lapels. Formal gloves in light grey suede, chamois, or kid leather were also required.|$|R
