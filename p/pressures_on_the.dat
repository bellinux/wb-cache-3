5|$|In combating the Iron Guard, Tătărescu {{chose to}} relax {{virtually}} all <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> latter (while mimicking {{some of its}} messages), and instead concentrated again on curbing {{the activities of the}} Romanian Communist Party (PCR) and outlawing its Popular Front-type organizations (see Amicii URSS).|$|E
5|$|Business {{aviation}} {{has shown}} strong growth, although {{the numbers of}} aircraft on the UK register have declined. This reflects a shift away from turboprop aircraft towards foreign-registered business jets based in the UK, which {{are estimated to be}} growing in numbers. However, twin piston-engined aircraft numbers have declined significantly, reflecting <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> light air-taxi segment from increasingly flexible and cheaper scheduled services, and a more sophisticated corporate charter business. The amount of flight training conducted by UK schools has declined, largely at the hands of competition from foreign schools, which benefit from lower costs and better weather.|$|E
5|$|Each {{party in}} a coevolutionary {{relationship}} exerts selective <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other, thereby affecting each other's evolution. Coevolution includes many forms of mutualism, host-parasite, and predator-prey relationships between species, as well as competition within or between species. In many cases, the selective pressures drive an evolutionary arms race between the species involved. Pairwise or specific coevolution, between exactly two species, {{is not the only}} possibility; in guild or diffuse coevolution, several species may evolve a trait in reciprocity with a trait in another species, as has happened between the flowering plants and pollinating insects such as bees, flies, and beetles.|$|E
50|$|A long lower shank in {{relation}} to the upper shank (or purchase) increases the leverage, and thus <b>the</b> <b>pressure,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> curb groove and the bars of the mouth. A long upper shank {{in relation}} to the lower shank increases <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> poll, but does not apply as much <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bars of the mouth.|$|R
50|$|The {{force is}} exerted {{by the air}} as a <b>pressure</b> {{difference}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> airfoil's surfaces. <b>Pressure</b> in a fluid is always positive in an absolute sense, so that pressure must always {{be thought of as}} pushing, and never as pulling. The pressure thus pushes inward <b>on</b> <b>the</b> airfoil everywhere <b>on</b> both <b>the</b> upper and lower surfaces. The flowing air reacts to the presence of the wing by reducing <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wing's upper surface and increasing <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower surface. <b>The</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower surface pushes up harder than <b>the</b> reduced <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper surface pushes down, and the net result is upward lift.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with many}} other bits, a pelham may have a solid or a jointed mouthpiece. If solid, it may range from a nearly {{straight}} [...] "Mullen" [...] mouthpiece up to a medium port. The pelham's mouthpiece controls <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tongue, roof of the mouth, and bars. A mullen mouth places even <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bars and tongue. A port places more <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bars, and provide room for the tongue. A high port may act <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof of the mouth as it touches, and will act as a fulcrum, amplifying <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bars of the mouth.|$|R
5|$|Endurance {{departed}} from South Georgia for the Weddell Sea on 5 December, heading for Vahsel Bay. As the ship moved southward navigating in ice, first year ice was encountered, which slowed progress. Deep in the Weddell Sea, conditions gradually grew worse until, on 19 January 1915, Endurance became frozen fast in an ice floe. On 24 February, realising {{that she would}} be trapped until the following spring, Shackleton ordered the abandonment of ship's routine and her conversion to a winter station. She drifted slowly northward with the ice through the following months. When spring arrived in September, the breaking of the ice and its later movements put extreme <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ship's hull.|$|E
5|$|Enron's audit {{committee}} was later criticized for its brief meetings that would cover {{large amounts of}} material. In one meeting on February 12, 2001, the committee met {{for an hour and}} a half. Enron's {{audit committee}} did not have the technical knowledge to question the auditors properly on accounting issues related to the company's special purpose entities. The committee was also unable to question the company's management due to <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> committee. The United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' report accused the board members of allowing conflicts of interest to impede their duties as monitoring the company's accounting practices. When Enron's scandal became public, the audit committee's conflicts of interest were regarded with suspicion.|$|E
5|$|The huia {{was found}} {{throughout}} the North Island before humans arrived in New Zealand. The Māori are estimated to have arrived around 800 years ago, and {{by the arrival of}} European settlers in the 1840s, habitat destruction and hunting had reduced the bird's range to the southern North Island. However, Māori hunting <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> huia were limited to some extent by traditional protocols. The hunting season was from May to July when the bird's plumage was in prime condition, while a rāhui (hunting ban) was enforced in spring and summer. It was not until European settlement that the huia's numbers began to decline severely, due mainly to two well-documented factors: widespread deforestation and over hunting.|$|E

50|$|From Bernoulli's principle, <b>the</b> <b>{{pressure}}</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{upper surface}} where the flow is moving faster {{is lower than}} <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower surface where it is moving slower.

5|$|Due to {{unfavourable}} currency {{conditions and}} conflicting <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> military budget, several prospective procurements of modern aircraft {{such as the}} SEPECAT Jaguar and the British Aerospace Sea Harrier were put on hold following the 1971 war; the indigenously developed HAL HF-24 Marut had also not been as successful as hoped, thus the IAF decided to retain the ageing fleets of Hunters and English Electric Canberra bombers. After considering several foreign aircraft to replace the Hunter, including the Dassault Mirage F1, the Saab 37 Viggen, and several Soviet models, the Indian government announced its intention to procure 200 Jaguars, {{a large portion of}} which were to be assembled domestically, in October 1978. In 1996, the last of the IAF's Hunters were phased out of service, the remaining single squadron operating the Hunter converting to the newer Sukhoi Su-30MKI.|$|E
5|$|Iowa is {{the second}} studio album by the American heavy metal band Slipknot. Released by Roadrunner Records on August 28, 2001, it was {{produced}} by Ross Robinson and Slipknot. The title derives from the band's home state, Iowa, which members have stated {{is one of their}} greatest sources of inspiration. With much anticipation for the band's second album following on the success of their 1999 self-titled debut, <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> band were high. Their relationships with each other suffered and was later described as the darkest time of their career. It was also the first time that guitarist Jim Root had been significantly involved in a Slipknot album as Root was only featured on two songs from their debut album, due to his joining very late in recording of that release. Despite troubles within the band and with Iowas development, Slipknot promoted it for almost a year.|$|E
5|$|Peter Molyneux and James Leach came up {{with the}} idea of {{creating}} a Theme game based on a hospital, but Molyneux was not directly involved in development due to his work on Dungeon Keeper. Designers originally planned to include four distinct gameplay modes corresponding to historical time periods, but this was dropped due to time <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team. Multiplayer support with up to four players was added in a patch. The game received a generally positive reception, with reviewers praising the graphics and humour in particular. Theme Hospital was a commercial success, selling over 4 million copies worldwide, and was ported to the PlayStation in 1998. A Sega Saturn version was in development, but cancelled. The game was re-released on GOG.com in 2012 and Origin in 2015, and the PlayStation version was released on the PlayStation Network in Europe in 2008, Japan in 2009, and North America in 2010. Revival attempts have been made with the development of open-source remakes such as CorsixTH.|$|E

50|$|The snaffle {{differs from}} the pelham bit, the curb bit, and the kimberwicke {{in that it is}} a non-leverage bit, and so does not amplify the {{pressure}} applied by the reins. With a snaffle, one ounce of pressure applied by the reins to a snaffle mouthpiece will apply one ounce of <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mouth. With a curb, one ounce of <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> reins will apply more - sometimes far more - than one ounce of <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> horse's mouth.|$|R

5|$|The {{options for}} the new stadium {{included}} adding a third tier to the existing National Stadium, or moving to a new site. This last option was discounted {{because it would have}} required a vast car parking facility, and that would have put severe short-term <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> local transport infrastructure, creating traffic jams and pollution. The committee eventually chose a new stadium on the same site but with considerable increase in its capacity. It would also involve moving the alignment of the stadium from west-east to north-south. This was the option supported by the Millennium Commission. It would become the fourth redevelopment of the Cardiff Arms Park site. It was also decided that the new stadium should have a sliding roof to accommodate a multi-use venue, with a grass pitch for rugby and football. The only other sliding roofs in Europe at the time were at two Dutch stadia – the Amsterdam Arena, completed in 1996 with a capacity of 50,000; and Gelredome in Arnhem, a 30,000-capacity ground built from 1996 to 1998.|$|E
5|$|U.S. President Herbert Hoover {{signed the}} Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act into law on June 17, 1930. The tariff's {{aim was to}} protect {{agriculture}} in the United States, but congressional representatives ultimately raised tariffs {{on a host of}} manufactured goods resulting in average duties as high as 53% on over a thousand various goods. Twenty-five trading partners responded in kind by introducing new tariffs {{on a wide range of}} U.S. goods. Hoover was pressured and compelled to adhere to the Republican Party's 1928 platform, which sought protective tariffs to alleviate market <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nation's struggling agribusinesses and reduce the domestic unemployment rate. The culmination of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression heightened fears, further pressuring Hoover to act on protective policies against the advice of Henry Ford and over 1,000 economists who protested by calling for a veto of the act. Exports from the United States plummeted 60% from 1930 to 1933. Worldwide international trade virtually ground to a halt. The international ramifications of the Smoot-Hawley tariff, comprising protectionist and discriminatory trade policies and bouts of economic nationalism, are credited by economists with prolongment and worldwide propagation of the Great Depression.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{monorail}} beam (Z 206 - 25) of Chongqing straddle monorail {{transit system}} {{was selected as}} the research object. The spatial coupling vibration model of vehicle-bridge system was established and corresponding procedure was compiled. The effect of travelling, steering and stabilizing wheel pressure respectively and typical combined wheel <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> system vibration was studied. The results show that the change of wheel pressure has great effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> response of the system. The vertical response value increases with travelling wheel pressure increasing. The lateral response value increases with steering wheel pressure increasing, while the effect of stabilizing wheel <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> response is irregular. The effect of steering wheel pressure is greater than that of stabilizing wheel <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> lateral responses. <b>The</b> effect of all of travelling and steering wheel pressure is greater than that of unilateral wheel <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> response. The effect tendency of stabilizing wheel <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> response is opposite to that of unilateral wheel pressure...|$|R
50|$|A pelham {{works on}} several {{parts of a}} horse's head, {{depending}} on which rein is applied. The mouthpiece acts when either the snaffle or curb rein is applied and puts <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bars, tongue, and lips of the horse. The curb chain and design of the mouthpiece can alter the degree of <b>pressure</b> placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> horse's mouth. The roof of the mouth is affected if the bit mouthpiece of the pelham has a high port {{or if it is}} jointed. <b>Pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> poll occurs when the curb rein is engaged, and pressure {{is directly related to the}} length of the upper shank (purchase arm) in relation to the lower shank (lever arm). All pelhams apply some <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> poll. <b>Pressure</b> is applied to the chin groove by the curb chain when the curb rein is used.
