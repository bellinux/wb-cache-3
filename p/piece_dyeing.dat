50|$|Fabric dyeing, {{also known}} as <b>piece</b> <b>dyeing,</b> is dyeing fabric {{after it has been}} constructed. It is {{economical}} and the most common method of dyeing solid colored fabrics. The decision regarding color can be made after the fabric has been manufactured. Thus, it is suitable for quick response orders. Dye penetration may not be good in thicker fabrics, so yarn dyeing is sometimes used to dye thick fabrics in solid colors. Various types of dyeing machines are used for <b>piece</b> <b>dyeing.</b> The selection of the equipment is based on factors such as dye and fabric characteristics, cost, and the intended end use.|$|E

50|$|Cross dyeing is “a {{method of}} dyeing blend or {{combination}} fabrics {{to two or}} more shades {{by the use of}} dyes with different affinities for the different fibers”. The cross dyeing process can be used to create heather effects, and plaid, check, or striped fabrics. Cross dyed fabrics may be mistaken for fiber or yarn dyed materials as the fabric is not a solid color, a characteristic considered typical of <b>piece</b> <b>dyed</b> fabrics. It is not possible to visually differentiate between cross dyed fabrics and those dyed at the fiber or yarn stage. An example is cross dyeing blue worsted wool fabric with polyester pin stripes. When dyed, the wool yarns are dyed blue, whereas the polyester yarns remain white.|$|R

The commercial dyes selected for the study contained, both the fluoro triaging and vinyl siphoned reactive groups, in the same molecule. Four different shades of the CIBACRON FN reactive series were applied on 100 % cotton knitted fabric by exhaustion method. Each fabric <b>piece</b> <b>dyed</b> was subsequently subject to the treatment by a softener. This {{was followed by the}} assessment of color fastness ratings for washing, light and Rubbing. Light fastness was assessed subjectively with the blue wool standard and is further confirmed objectively {{with the help of the}} spectrophotometer. The fastness ratings were compared with the softner-free samples of the same shade. This study has revealed that the treatment with softeners has resulted in a general improvement in wash and light fastness properties Polyethylene emulsion has adversely affected wash fastness irrespective of the shade. A significant reduction in the light fastness was evident when treated with cationic softeners. The dye, CIBACRON BRILLIANT BLUE FN-G has shown peculiar reduction in light fastness following treatment with all types of softeners. In addition to the above, certain other trends and patterns have also been noticed when analyzing the data collected...|$|R

40|$|The {{start of}} the First World War stimulated among other things a {{reassessment}} of America 2 ̆ 7 s relationship with Europe. Many {{in the art world}} voiced the need for the industrial arts to assert independence and William Laurel Harris echoed popular sentiment when he wrote in Good Furniture magazine: We are [...] . a great industrial nation without an industrial art. Now is the time, and now is the hour, when by intelligent action our manufacturers can rectify this lack of practical thought in our educational efforts. The manufacturers, the educators and the artistic portion of the nation must join hands in creating an industrial art that will bring prosperity, happiness and the charm to all the American people. 2 ̆ 2 Harris 2 ̆ 7 s call to arms for the industrial arts was taken up with particular fervor by Morris De Camp Crawford, a textile scholar and editor at Women 2 ̆ 7 s Wear, a daily journal for the fashion industries. (Fig. 1) Unlike many of his colleagues in the textile and fashion trades who feared the impending separation from Europe, Crawford optimistically viewed the war as the perfect opportunity for American textiles and fashions to claim its independence. In 1916, Crawford assembled a group of educators and industrialists from New York to discuss the plight of American design and its improvement through proper education in the industrial arts. Together with Henry W. Kent of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Albert Blum of the United <b>Piece</b> <b>Dye</b> Works, Dr. Clark Wissler of the American Museum of Natural History, and E. W.

40|$|This project {{explores the}} {{combination}} of a woven structure consisting of different fibers with dyeing to create a multidimensional woven textile capable of altering in expression. This project aims to show how a designer can work with fibre-specific dyeing and multiple fibers in a woven textile and the many possibilities this lends in a design process. With a sustainable approach to the matter used in the project, creating more with less, a suggestion is made of an alternative method of creating multidimensional fabrics. The chemical reaction between pigment and fiber is explored to show a greater appreciation for the textile material and to create fabrics capable of multiple expressions. One woven fabric, in individual <b>pieces,</b> is <b>dyed</b> in reactive-, acid- and disperse-dye. The cellulose-, wool- and synthetic yarns in the fabric absorb their intended pigment but also show how they react to another category of dye. A series of dyed samples, all originating from the same woven material with an abstract pattern, show the varied expression the treatment can achieve. The fabric and method presented in the project show an example of how one can compose a series of textiles with less matter but with more expression...|$|R

5000|$|The textile industry, {{dominant}} in the Paris economy until the 15th century, was greatly reduced by foreign competition in the 15th century. New industries took its place, particularly the dyeing of fabrics. The dyeing workshops in the faubourg Saint-Marcel, along the Bievre River, produced six hundred thousand <b>pieces</b> of <b>dyed</b> cloth a year, and made the fortunes of some Paris families, including Gobelin, Canaye and Peultre. However, production fell to one hundred thousand {{by the end of}} the sixteenth century, due to the Wars of Religion and competition from other cities. The manufacture of certain luxury products, such as belts, gloves, and perfumes, and women's bonnets were another important part of the economy, which flourished after the royal court returned to Paris from the Loire Valley. Leather workers, mostly from Spain, Italy and Hungary, installed their workshops in the Saint-Marcel quarter, while German woodcarvers began to make furniture in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Very few workshops had large numbers of employees; most goods were made in small workshops by master artisans and their apprentices, where the family lived in the same building behind the workshop. A new industry had appeared at the end of the 15th century; the printing of books. Books were luxury goods, and were most printed in the neighborhood close to the University.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{evidence}} of dyeing comes from India where a <b>piece</b> of cotton <b>dyed</b> with madder has been {{recovered from the}} archaeological site at Mohenjo-daro (3rd millennium BCE). In Sanskrit, this plant is known by the name Manjishtha. It was used by hermits to dye their clothes saffron. Dioscorides and Pliny the Elder (De Re Natura) mention the plant (Rubia passiva). In Viking age levels of York, remains of both woad and madder have been excavated. The oldest European textiles dyed with madder come from the grave of the Merovingian queen Arnegundis in Saint-Denis near Paris (between 565 and 570 AD). In the [...] "Capitulare de villis" [...] of Charlemagne, madder is mentioned as [...] "warentiam". The herbal of Hildegard of Bingen mentions the plant as well.

40|$|Bleached {{wool felt}} {{was chosen as}} a {{substitute}} for human hair to avoid complications due to natural pig-ment. <b>Pieces</b> were <b>dyed</b> by immersion in lawsone or henna suspension, and their colors assessed using a Lovibond tintometer and a Hunterlab colorimeter. With lawsone, immersion for 30 minutes was sufficient to dye the wool. The hue and intensity of the color developed id not change significantly when the pH was varied between 3 and 5, in contrast to the electronic spectra of lawsone solutions, in which absorbance decreased progressively with decreasing pH. Below pH 6 the color of the wool varied little with pH and was predominantly red, but above pH 6 the intensity decreased and the yellow component became pre-dominant. At pH 4. 5 the intensity of the red component increased with dyeing temperature between 15 and 50 øC, and became progressively more predominant. The color developed with henna increased with temperature, and also with time, probably because time was required to extract coloring matter from the plant tissue. In contrast to lawsone, henna gave a color which was predominantly yellow and had a greater blue component over the whole pH range. Both factors were attributed to the chlorophyll content. Sub-stantivity was tested by extracting felts with water and measuring the absorbance of the extract after timed intervals. The extraction rate was unaffected by dyeing time, pH, or temperature. Examination of the extracted wool pieces suggested that a slow reaction occurs on the wool, either producing new compounds which are more substantive than lawsone to wool or changing the mode of attachment, and thereby in-creasing the strength of the interaction...|$|R
40|$|Committee members: Nancy G Caine (Chair), Wesley P Schultz, Richard N BrayPast {{studies have}} {{explored}} {{and supported the}} hypothesis that trichromacy offers an advantage over dichromacy in detecting ripe fruit. Few studies have explored whether this advantage is maintained in food selection, that is, if the color cues available to trichromatic individuals help them to select the most optimal pieces of fruit once that fruit has been detected. I presented Geoffroy's marmosets with pieces of red-orange fruits that have color cues available to trichromats, but not dichromats. These cues are related to ripeness and palatability. I predicted that trichromats and dichromats would differ in food selection behaviors during a given visit to the food pan. I also predicted {{that there would be}} no differences between trichromats and dichromats when fruit <b>pieces</b> were <b>dyed</b> black. I explored the possibility that there were enough color cues available to dichromats in blue and yellow fruit to eliminate any differences between the dichromats and trichromats. The results of my study did not clearly support my general hypothesis that marmosets use available color cues to select fruit. However, the primary comparisons did generate a pattern of trends in the predicted directions: trichromats sniffed, tasted, and rejected red fruit less often than did dichromats, and were also more efficient at selecting red than black fruit. The exploratory hypotheses regarding blue and yellow foods generated less compelling and inconsistent results. The unexpected finding that trichromats examined all foods longer than dichromats suggests a possible difference in trichromatic and dichromatic reliance on visual inspection of foods.

50|$|The {{earliest}} dyed flax fibers {{have been}} found in a prehistoric cave in the Republic of Georgia and date back to 34,000 BC.More evidence of textile dyeing dates back to the Neolithic period at the large Neolithic settlement at Çatalhöyük in southern Anatolia, where traces of red dyes, possibly from ocher, an iron oxide pigment derived from clay, were found. In China, dyeing with plants, barks, and insects has been traced back more than 5,000 years. Early evidence of dyeing comes from Sindh province in Pakistan, where a <b>piece</b> of cotton <b>dyed</b> with a vegetable dye was recovered from the archaeological site at Mohenjo-daro (3rd millennium BCE). The dye used in this case was madder, which, along with other dyes such as indigo, was introduced to other regions through trade. Natural insect dyes such as Cochineal and kermes and plant-based dyes such as woad, indigo and madder were important elements of the economies of Asia and Europe until the discovery of man-made synthetic dyes in the mid-19th century. The first synthetic dye was William Perkin's mauveine in 1856, derived from coal tar. Alizarin, the red dye present in madder, was the first natural pigment to be duplicated synthetically in 1869, a development which led to the collapse of the market for naturally grown madder. The development of new, strongly colored synthetic dyes followed quickly, and by the 1870s commercial dyeing with natural dyestuffs was disappearing.|$|R
5000|$|Fortuny {{was born}} on 11 May 1871, to an artistic family in Granada, Spain. His father, a genre painter, died when Fortuny {{was three years old}} and his mother, {{daughter}} of another painter, Raimundo de Madrazo y Garreta, moved the family to Paris, France. It became apparent at a young age that Fortuny was a talented artist, as he, too, showed a talent for painting as well as a passion for textiles. During his childhood he was introduced to many different textiles and fabrics, which greatly imprinted upon his creativity. His parents were very passionate for materials and had their own collections of textiles from various shops they had visited in Europe. His father even collected metalwork and armour from previous ages as a hobby. [...] As a young child he was fascinated with all of these textiles and would even <b>dye</b> <b>pieces</b> of material for amusement.It was this exposure that led him to grow up and begin designing and producing his own textiles and dresses. The family moved again in 1889 to Venice, Italy. As a young man, Fortuny travelled throughout Europe seeking out artists he admired, among them the German composer Richard Wagner. Fortuny became quite varied in his talents, some of them including inventing, painting, photography, sculpting, architecture, etching and even theatrical stage lighting. In 1897, he met the woman he would marry, Henriette Negrin, in Paris. While in Paris, using all of his creative talents, Fortuny registered and patented more than twenty inventions between 1901 and 1934.|$|R
40|$|Natural dyes are {{colorants}} {{derived from}} specific items {{found in the}} natural environment: plants, insects, animals, and minerals. A natural material that produces a dye is called a dyestuff. For example, the dye, madder, is extracted from madder dyestuff, the roots of a sprawling perennial, Rubia tinctorum. Many natural dyes require a mordant to permanently bond with a fiber. Mordants are usually chemical salts such as ferrous sulfate or aluminum potassium sulfate that form {{a bridge between the}} dye and the fiber. Natural dyes can be processed in several ways, including one or more water based extractions of the dye from the dyestuff, dyestuff fermentation to produce a useable dye, immersion in a dyebath, or repeated immersions in a dyebath. The traditional process usually involves at least three steps: preparing the textile to be dyed by mordanting it before dyeing; extracting the dye from the dyestuff in a water bath; and heating the mordanted textile in the water-based dye extract to produce a level color and strong bond between the dye and the fiber. However, there are many other options open to dyers including contact dyeing, extracting with a solvent other than water, fermentation, and low immersion dyeing where the water to fiber ratio is low. Commonly used mordants include aluminum potassium sulfate, iron sulfate, copper sulfate, stannous chloride, and potassium dichromate, although there are health and environmental concerns about the last three. Each paper in this section focuses on an individual dimension of natural dyes and represents a small sample of the work created with natural dyes. None of us covers the entire spectrum possible with the hundreds of natural dyes used by dyers today and in the past. Natural dyers often describe dyed fabric by identifying the dyestuff; the mordant, and the processes used to extract the dye and dye the fabric. Cultural expression reveals the multi-dimensional environment in which a fiber artist lives and works and reflects the technologies within that environment. The use of natural dyes reflects my personal philosophy. The images shown in this paper reflect my work. All these <b>pieces</b> are <b>dyed</b> with natural dyes, but use a variety of dyes, mordants, and processes. Natural dyes ground me in the present, but they also connect me to the past and future. Most of my Iowa-grown dyes are used fresh. So, in the present, I harvest and dye, usually on the same day. Often, I use contact dyeing, 1 a process making use of solar energy, fresh and found materials, liquids, and mordants to develop color and bond the dye to the fiber. Several textiles described in this paper were made using this dyeing method. I also use traditional immersion dyeing, resist dyeing methods, additional extractions, and repeated dips. Historical connections occur as I explore the techniques, processes and resources that have been used by various cultures to achieve specific colors and create visual impressions and patterns. Future connections occur as I explore innovations in processes, mordants, and new dyestuffs that minimize environmental problems. Natural dyes motivate me to be more experimental, more creative, and more expressive...|$|R
