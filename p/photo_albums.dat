5|$|Research in the {{archives}} of pre-1914 horse breeding operations found at Windhoek, combined with blood typing studies, suggests that the animals descended from a gene pool of high-quality riding animals, as opposed to work horses. A study released in 2005 reinforces {{the theory of the}} Namib Desert Horse descending from a combination of European-descended breeding stock and escaped military horses. One possible source of breeding stock was a stud farm near Kubub, leased by Emil Kreplin (previously mayor of Lüderitz) from 1911 to 1919. <b>Photo</b> <b>albums</b> from the stud show animals with conformation and markings similar to those seen in the modern Namib Desert Horse. In addition, in early 1915, during the fighting of World War I, bombs were dropped by a German aircraft onto the South African camp near Garub. Some ordnance seems to have been specifically targeted to land among a herd of 1,700 grazing horses, for the purposes of scattering them. These escaped army animals may have joined stock animals lost from Kreplin's stud farm during the turmoil of the war. Horses in the area would likely have congregated at the few existing watering places in the Aus Mountains and Garub.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of Prokudin-Gorsky's death, the tsar {{and his family had}} long since been {{executed}} during the Russian Revolution, and Communist rule had been established over what was once the Russian Empire. The surviving boxes of <b>photo</b> <b>albums</b> and fragile glass plates the negatives were recorded on were finally stored {{in the basement of a}} Parisian apartment building, and the family was worried about them getting damaged. The United States Library of Congress purchased the material from Prokudin-Gorsky's heirs in 1948 for $3500–$5000 on the initiative of a researcher inquiring into their whereabouts. The library counted 1,902 negatives and 710 album prints without corresponding negatives in the collection.|$|E
25|$|Another reason family {{folklore}} {{might be}} suppressed or lost {{is when the}} references are too painful {{at the present time}} or to the present generation. When Catherine Noren found <b>photo</b> <b>albums</b> and other old family portraits in her grandmother’s attic, she unwittingly unearthed an entire family history of a prosperous German-Jewish family before the Holocaust. It became her task, one generation removed, to explore and record the family history in a book containing photos, diaries and memories of her family history. It is only because these albums and portraits had not been discarded along with the narrative that Noren came to know her family story.|$|E
25|$|Family {{folklore}} is {{the branch}} of folkloristics concerned with the study and use of folklore and traditional culture transmitted within a family group. This includes items of material culture, crafts produced by family members or memorabilia saved as reminders or remainders of significant family events. It also includes family photos and <b>photo</b> <b>albums</b> in paper and electronic format, along with bundles of other pages held for posterity: certificates, letters, journals, notes and shopping lists. Family stories and sayings, originally recounting actual events, are told and retold until the historical facts {{give way to a}} distilled expression of common identity. Family customs are performed, modified, forgotten, created or resurrected with alarming frequency; each time with the goal of defining and solidifying the perception of this family as unique, distinct and different from other families.|$|E

25|$|Techniques of collage {{were first}} {{used at the}} time of the {{invention}} of paper in China, around 200 BC. The use of collage, however, wasn't used by many people until the 10th century in Japan, when calligraphers began to apply glued paper, using texts on surfaces, when writing their poems. The technique of collage appeared in medieval Europe during the 13th century. Gold leaf panels started to be applied in Gothic cathedrals around the 15th and 16th centuries. Gemstones and other precious metals were applied to religious images, icons, and also, to coats of arms. An 18th-century example of collage art can be found in the work of Mary Delany. In the 19th century, collage methods also were used among hobbyists for memorabilia (e.g. applied to <b>photo</b> <b>albums)</b> and books (e.g. Hans Christian Andersen, Carl Spitzweg).|$|E

25|$|Under Philip Flax a new Flax store {{opened in}} 1966, in the 27,000 square foot Goldberg Bowen Building at 250 Sutter Street. In 1978 a new {{location}} at 1699 Market Street opened, followed by {{the closure of the}} Sutter Street store in 1981. The company began distributing mail order catalogs nationally in 1984. Craig Flax oversaw the major growth and transition of the catalog business with an expanded range of gift-oriented items and eventually new specialty titles. Reflecting the broader product range, Flax's Artists Materials began doing business as FLAX art & design in 1991. Two new brands were developed, Collage and The Paper Catalog in 1995 and 1998 respectively, and featured <b>photo</b> <b>albums,</b> stationery, fine pens, and decorative papers marketed through catalogs and eCommerce websites. Through 2002 - 2003, Flax acquired the assets of Reliable Home Office, T. Shipley and Sparks.com. In 2005, the company achieved a ranking in Internet Retailers Top 500 Guide. Flax ceased all direct marketing activities by the end of 2007 and returned its focus to brick and mortar activity.|$|E

500|$|Originally it wasn't {{going to}} have {{anything}} to do with that, but people were looking through my <b>photo</b> <b>albums</b> this year.

So I guess I thought if someone's going to do it might as well be me. The story line [...] is about an interracial couple. It's sort of Romeo and Juliet but it's set in the '60s and they're kind of torn apart. It's about their struggle and I'm sort of the narrator. I don't want to give too much away about it, but it's nice. Something I could relate to, being the product of an interracial union, though [...] did not wind up happily ever after standing in church together.|$|E

500|$|In {{her letters}} to her {{siblings}} in Tobolsk, Maria described her unease {{at the new}} restrictions on the family at Yekaterinburg. She and her parents were searched by guards at the Ipatiev House and were warned they {{would be subject to}} further searches. A wooden fence was installed around the house, limiting their view of the street. [...] "Oh, how complicated everything is now," [...] she wrote on May 2, 1918. [...] "We lived so peacefully for eight months and now it's all started again." [...] Maria passed the time by attempting to befriend members of the Ipatiev House Guard. She showed them pictures from her <b>photo</b> <b>albums</b> and talked with them about their families and her own hopes for a new life in England if she was released. Alexander Strekotin, one of the guards, recalled in his memoirs that she [...] "was a girl who loved to have fun." [...] Another of the guards recalled Maria's buxom beauty with appreciation and said she didn't assume an air of grandeur. One former sentry recalled that Maria was often scolded by her mother in [...] "severe and angry whispers," [...] apparently for being too friendly with the guards at Yekaterinburg. Strekotin wrote that their conversations always began with one of the girls saying, [...] "We're so bored! In Tobolsk there was always something to do. I know! Try to guess the name of this dog!" [...] The teenage girls walked by the sentries, whispering and giggling in a manner that the guards considered flirtatious.|$|E
