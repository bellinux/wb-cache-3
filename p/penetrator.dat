5|$|The SS190 FMJ, a {{refinement}} of the SS90, {{was introduced in}} 1993. It offered superior performance over the prototype projectile as well as slightly reduced length. The latter change allowed it to be used more conveniently in the Five-seven pistol, also being developed at that time. Fired from the P90, the SS190 propels a 2.0-g (31grain) bullet at a muzzle velocity of roughly 715m/s (2,350 ft/s). It has a steel <b>penetrator</b> and an aluminum core. The SS190 has been manufactured with a plain, black, and a black-on-white tip color. It is classified by the ATF as armor-piercing (AP) handgun ammunition, and its sale is currently restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a {{proposal}} for an asteroid mission was submitted to the European Space Agency (ESA). Named the Asteroidal Gravity Optical and Radar Analysis (AGORA), this spacecraft was to launch some time in 1990–1994 and perform two flybys of large asteroids. The preferred target for this mission was Vesta. AGORA would reach the asteroid belt either by a gravitational slingshot trajectory past Mars or {{by means of a}} small ion engine. However, the proposal was refused by the ESA. A joint NASA–ESA asteroid mission was then drawn up for a Multiple Asteroid Orbiter with Solar Electric Propulsion (MAOSEP), with one of the mission profiles including an orbit of Vesta. NASA indicated they were not interested in an asteroid mission. Instead, the ESA set up a technological study of a spacecraft with an ion drive. Other missions to the asteroid belt were proposed in the 1980s by France, Germany, Italy and the United States, but none were approved. Exploration of Vesta by fly-by and impacting <b>penetrator</b> was the second main target of the first plan of the multi-aimed Soviet Vesta mission, developed in cooperation with European countries for realisation in 1991–1994 but canceled due to the Soviet Union disbanding.|$|E

The DAP is equipped with ESSS or ETS stub wings, each capable of carrying configurations of the M230 Chain Gun 30mm automatic cannon, 19-shot Hydra 70 rocket pod, AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles, GAU-19 gun pods, and M134 minigun pods, M134D miniguns are used as door guns. which are typically fixed forward for firing during strafing runs.|$|E
25|$|In March 2011, the USAF {{decided to}} {{purchase}} 80 to 100 aircraft. The Global Strike Command indicated that one {{requirement for the}} bomber is to carry a weapon of similar effect to the Massive Ordnance <b>Penetrator.</b> In addition to the strategic bombing, tactical bombing, and prompt global strike roles typical for a bomber, the aircraft is {{to be part of}} a family of systems responsible for ground surveillance and electronic attack. The Obama Administration in its 2012 budget request asked for $197 million and a total of $3.7 billion over five years to develop the bomber, including modular payloads for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), electronic attack (EA), and communications. It shall be nuclear-capable, but shall not be certified as such until older bombers are set to retire.|$|E
50|$|Mars 96 carried four {{assemblies}} {{designed to}} enter the Martian atmosphere, two surface <b>penetrators</b> and two surface stations.

25|$|T-72B3 (Ob'yekt 184-M3): this upgrade was {{initiated}} in 2010 using old stocks of T-72B tanks held in reserve. In addition to performing a general overhaul of every vehicle, certain tanks were {{equipped with the}} more powerful V-92S2 engines, a new steering system in the driver's compartment and older tracks were replaced with the new universal, twin-pin design. The upgrade program focuses instead on improving the tank's firepower, mainly through {{the implementation of the}} Kalina fire control system, albeit in a simplified form. The tank commander retains an upgraded version of the legacy TKN-3MK sight, which is a passive device with a range of only 600 m at night, but is augmented with a monitor that displays thermal imagery from the gunner's main sight. The commander also has a new turret control panel. The gunner still has the 1A40-4 FCS with 1K13-49 sight, but these are now part of the auxiliary sighting system to complement the new PNM Sosna-U panoramic multi-spectral sensor, which replaced the TPN-3-49 in its mounting. The Sosna-U is a multi-channel, panoramic sight stabilized in both vertical and horizontal axes with a built-in laser rangefinder and command guidance module used with 9M119M missiles. The most advantageous aspect of the Sosna-U is the Thales Catherine-FC thermal imager which extends the detection and identification range of a tank-sized target to 10,500 m and 2,200 m respectively, at night/day and in all weather combat conditions. The T-72B3 series vehicles also received the new 2A46M5 main gun which has a dispersion value significantly lower than previous generations, and reportedly equivalent to the Rheinmetall Rh120 L/44 cannon. The gun laying and stabilization drives were also replaced with the new 2E42-4 system and the AZ ammunition auto-loader was appropriately modified to accommodate newer generations of long-rod (up to 730mm) saboted kinetic energy anti-tank ammunition: the Svinets-1 (using a depleted uranium <b>penetrator)</b> and Svinets-2 (sintered tungsten alloy) rounds, which were fielded in 2002 and reportedly capable of defeating 740–800mm and 660–740mm of RHA at 2,000 m respectively. Only the most recent T-72B3 tanks however feature this capability. Furthermore, the B3 upgrade includes a new explosion and fire suppression system, as well as an advanced VHF radio system designated R-168-25U-2 AKVEDUK. Entered service on 19 October 2012. First delivered to the 20th Field Army in summer 2013 and its Armored Guards Brigade in October 2013. More than 1,000 such tanks are currently in service.|$|E
500|$|The United States {{developed}} its own {{kinetic energy}} <b>penetrator</b> (KEP) tank {{round in the}} form of an Armor-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding-Sabot (APFSDS) round, using a depleted uranium (DU) alloy long-rod <b>penetrator</b> (LRP), designated as the M829, followed by improved versions. An immediate improvement, known as the M829A1, was called the [...] "Silver Bullet" [...] after its good combat performance during the Gulf War against Iraqi T-55s, T-62s and T-72 tanks. The M829 series centers around the depleted uranium <b>penetrator,</b> designed to penetrate enemy armor through kinetic energy and to shatter inside the turret, doing much damage within the tank. In 1998, the United States military introduced the M829A2, which has an improved depleted uranium <b>penetrator</b> and composite sabot petals. In 2002, production began of the ($10,000 per round) M829A3 using a more efficient propellant (RPD-380 stick), a lighter injection-molded sabot, and a longer (800mm) and heavier (10kg / 22lb) DU <b>penetrator,</b> which is said to be able to defeat the latest versions of Russian Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armor (ERA). This variant is unofficially referred to by Abrams tank crews as the [...] "super sabot". In response to the M829A3, the Russian army designed Relikt, the most modern Russian ERA, which is claimed to be twice as effective as Kontakt-5. A further improved M829E4 round with a segmented <b>penetrator</b> to defeat Relikt has been under development since 2011 and was to be fielded as the M829A4 in 2015.|$|E

This was followed by the similar Extended Range Strike Aircraft (ERSA), which added a variable-sweep wing, then in vogue in the aviation industry. ERSA envisioned a relatively small aircraft with a [...] payload and a range of , with [...] being flown at low altitudes.
