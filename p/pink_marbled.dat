Resembling an altarpiece but functioning as an inducement to good decision making, this monumental painting shows the four doctors of the Church (Sts Gregory and Jerome at the left, Ambrose and Augustine at the right) in a courtyard around a massive Madonna and Child. The Virgin's celestial court is vividly rendered with <b>marbled</b> <b>pink</b> and grey architecture, rich deep colours, costly robes, and lovingly observed plant life.|$|R
5000|$|Nationally known Steven Pearlston, a {{professional}} opera singer and director, was the synagogue's cantor and music director for 35 years until his resignation in July 2014. He possessed a broad {{knowledge of the}} full range of the Jewish liturgical, classical and secular musical repertoires, as well as Jewish history and philosophy. He was the cantor of the only synagogue in Queens which had {{a professional}} choir at all services. The choir performed behind an ornate grate above the <b>pink</b> <b>marbled</b> Ark. During the first 47 years, the synagogue did not have a cantor with the rabbi conducting services and the congregation singing the responses. In 1923, it obtained an organ which ranks in quality with some of the finest organs in Europe. [...] The Free Synagogue of Flushing has a youth and adult education program. It provides space to various political, community organizations, and fledgling church groups. Throughout its history, the synagogue has remained active in social action causes. Every year, it commemorates Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday in its sanctuary and hosts interfaith events.|$|E

Entry no. 3902 in the Ornamentstichsammlung (19 leaves) has G. A. No. 3903 (11 leaves) has P. S. No. 3904 (3 leaves) has P. S. No. 3905 (30 plates on 16 leaves) has both G. A. and P. S. It seems that the present work may consist of leaves from {{one or more of these}} works. This circumstance may be related to the broken sequence of pencilled numeration (" 2 " through " 28 ") in the upper right-hand corners of leaves [2 - 11]. Old identifications of G. A. with "Tribolo" and P. S. with Jacques Prevost are reflected by annotations in ink on leaves [5] and [9]; see Nagler. First leaf is engraved t. p., the rest are engravings of Roman capitals, entablatures, etc., nine of them provided with dimensions. Four are signed in the plate with the initials G.
