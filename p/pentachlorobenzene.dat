40|$|The {{replacement}} of conventional sample preparation techniques with newer techniques which are automated, {{faster and more}} eco-friendly, is nowadays desired in every analytical laboratory. One of the techniques with the attributes mentioned above is the Accelerated Solvent Extraction. In order to evaluate how successful this method is for the extraction of fat and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) from dried fish meat samples, we have tested two series of diverse fish using Dionexâ„¢ 350 ASE provided by Thermo Scientificâ„¢ (Germany). For a more interesting approach, we added to our investigation 7 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), 3 thricholorobenzenes, 2 tetrachlorobenzenes, 1 <b>pentachlorobenzenes</b> and 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). The study focused on comparing the recoveries of these analytes from different fish samples, after replacing the conventional reference method of the laboratory with ASE. The ASE parameters tested were previously used for the extraction of fat and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) from fish samples: temperature: 120 Â° C; static time: 5 min; number of cycles: 3; flushing volume: 25 %; rinse with nitrogen: 90 s; solvent: cyclohexane/ethyl acetate (ratio 1 : 1). The ASE method provided similar {{and in some cases}} better results when compared to the standard reference method, more rapidly, eco-friendly and safer.

The rapid initial uptake of <b>pentachlorobenzene</b> was obtained in the first 20 days. The results based on ionization potential and the partial least square function indicated that both enzymatic systems of lignin peroxidase and P- 450 monooxygenase involved in the degradation of <b>pentachlorobenzene.</b> By using addition of Tween 80, MnSO 4, and veratryl alcohol, degradation of <b>pentachlorobenzene</b> could be improved.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Photolysis of <b>pentachlorobenzene</b> {{was carried}} out {{in the absence of an}} {{electron}} donor species at 254 nm in cetyltrimethylammonium bromide surfactant solution. The results are consistent with the excited triplet undergoing homolytic cleavage of a C-Cl bond in competition with formation of the excimer, in which the radical anion undergoes C-Cl bond fission through a transition state with a bent localized radical center. The local concentration of the solute and the total probability of encounter of excited state with ground state <b>pentachlorobenzene</b> in a micelle were used to explain the kinetic data. Significant amounts of tetrachlorobromobenzenes were produced as byproducts. A mechanism for the photosubstitution reaction is proposed.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Several {{experiments}} were undertaken {{to investigate the}} mechanism of photodechlorination of <b>pentachlorobenzene.</b> The thermal methoxydechlorination reaction of <b>pentachlorobenzene</b> was studied. In DMSO at 50 °C sodium methoxide reacts smoothly with <b>pentachlorobenzene</b> to give three tetrachloroanisole isomers. A second-order kinetic plot for this reaction is linear to high precision, indicating that the reaction is second order overall. The rate of the reaction and the product regioisomer distribution are not affected {{by the presence of}} radical traps such as galvinoxyl, by reaction in the absence of oxygen or by benzyne intermediate traps such as 1, 3 -diphenylisobenzofuran. The rate of the reaction is reduced linearly as the starting mixture is diluted with methanol. These facts suggest that the reaction follows the classical S[subscript N]Ar mechanism. The proposed structure of the <b>pentachlorobenzene</b> radical anion formed by photolysis in the presence of triethylamine is analogous to the σ-complex intermediate in the S[subscript N]Ar reaction. The regiochemistry of these two types of dechlorination was compared and showed a fair correlation. The differences in regiochemistry were attributed to steric effects between the nucleophile and the aromatic ortho chlorine atoms in the S[subscript N]Ar reaction. Tetrachlorophenyl radicals were generated by thermal decomposition of 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrachlorobenzeneazotriphenylmethane in the presence of CCl₄ and a hydrogen atom donor. The selectivies of chlorine versus hydrogen or deuterium atom abstraction were determined in several systems and applied to selectivity of atom abstraction observed in photochemical experiments. The results support the hypothesis that, in the photolysis of <b>pentachlorobenzene</b> in the presence of triethylamine, the intermediate tetrachlorophenyl radical exists as an unencumbered free radical rather than in a solvent caged pair with triethylamine. It was anticipated that the rate of photodechlorination would increase in micellar solutions if triethylamine was added. Experiments showed no such expected increase in rate, and showed regiochemistry {{similar to that of the}} same reaction in the absence of triethylamine...|$|E

P., O'Hare, E. J., and Wong, L. L. (2001) Eur. J. Biochem. 268, 1460 - 1467). In the present work, we determined the crystal structure of this mutant with bound 1, 3, 5 -trichlorobenzene. The substrate {{was bound to}} crystallographically independent CYP 101 molecules {{in at least three}} different orientations, which were distinguished by the angle between the benzene ring and the porphyrin, and one orientation contained an Fe-Cl interaction. In another orientation, the substrate was almost parallel to the heme, with a C-H bond closest to the iron. The enzyme/substrate contacts suggested that the L 244 A mutation should promote the binding of <b>pentachlorobenzene</b> and hexachlorobenzene by creating space to accommodate the extra chlorines. The F 87 W/Y 96 F/L 244 A/V 247 L mutant thus designed was found to oxidize <b>pentachlorobenzene</b> at a rate of 82. 5 nmol (nmol CYP 101) (- 1) min(- 1), 45 times faster than the F 87 W/Y 96 F/V 247 L parent mutant.

Here, we study the physiological mode of action of three different compounds (cadmium, carbendazim, and <b>pentachlorobenzene)</b> with an experimental data¿based approach using whole life-cycle toxicity data from the nematode Acrobeloides nanus. We use a process-based model, based on the dynamic energy budget theory, to study the fluxes of energy related to physiological processes and their variation throughout the life cycle.

The metabolic pathway for hexachlorobenzene and <b>pentachlorobenzene</b> decay proceeded via 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrachlorobenzene (TTCB) [...] > 1, 2, 3 -TCB + 1, 2, 4 -TCB [...] > 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene (DCB) + 1, 4 -DCB [...] >CB. In a mineral salts medium, the CB-adapted soil microorganisms dehalogenated individual 1, 2, 4, 5 -TTCB, 1, 2, 3, 4 -TTCB, 1, 2, 3 -TCB, and 1, 2, 4 -TCB but not 1, 2, 3, 5 -TTCB or 1, 3, 5 -TCB. Similarly, {{a mixture of}} 2, 3, 6 -trichlorotoluene (TCT), 2, 5 -dichlorotoluene (DCT), and 3, 4 -DCT was reductively dechlorinated in soil slurries to predominantly toluene and small amounts of 2 -, 3 -, and 4 -chlorotoluene (CT). Toluene was further degraded. When tested individually in a mineral salts medium, the CT-adapted soil microorganisms dechlorinated several TCT and DCT isomers. Key metabolic routes for TCTs followed: 2, 3, 6 -TCT [...] > 2, 5 -DCT [...] > 2 -CT [...] >toluene; 2, 4, 5 -TCT [...] > 2, 5 -DCT + 3, 4 -DCT [...] > 3 -CT + 4 -CT [...] >toluene. Among DCTs tested, 2, 4 -DCT and 3, 4 -DCT were dechlorinated via the removal of o- and m-chlorine, respectively, to 4 -CT and subsequently to toluene via p-chlorine removal. Likewise, 2, 5 -DCT was dechlorinated via 2 -CT to toluene. Evidently, microorganisms capable of removing o-, m-, and p-chlorines {{are present in the}} soil system, as reflected by the dechlorination of different isomers of CBs and CTs to CB and toluene, respectively. These findings help clarify the metabolic fate of chlorinated benzenes and toluenes in anaerobic environments...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{concentrations}} of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), <b>pentachlorobenzene</b> (PeCB) and polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDE) were described in benthic and pelagic species collected off Adélie Land, Antarctica. Strong differences were observed among species, with reduced PeCB and HCB levels in benthic species, and elevated PCB {{levels in the}} Antarctic yellowbelly rockcod, the Antarctic sea urchin and the snow petrel. Lower-chlorinated congeners were predominant in krill; penta-PCBs in benthic organisms; hexa- and hepta-PCBs in seabirds and cryopelagic fish. This segregation may result from sedimentation process, specific accumulation and excretion, and/or biotransformation processes. The presence of PBDEs in Antarctic coastal organisms may originate from atmospheric transport and partly from a contamination by local sources. Although POP levels in Antarctic marine organisms were substantially lower than in Arctic and temperate organisms, very {{little is known about}} their toxic effects on these cold-adapted species, with high degree of endemism...|$|E
40|$|Decomposition of {{hexachlorobenzene}} (HCB) {{was investigated}} over several metal oxides (i. e., MgO, CaO, BaO, La 2 O 3, CeO 2, MnO 2, Fe 2 O 3, and Co 3 O 4) supported on Al 2 O 3, which was achieved in closed system at {{a temperature of}} 300 degrees C. Catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation with different metal oxides loading and impregnating solvents. The decomposition efficiency of different catalysts for this reaction depends {{on the nature of}} the metal oxide used, and Al 2 O 3 supported La 2 O 3 was found to be the most active one. <b>Pentachlorobenzene</b> (PeCB), and all tetrachlorobenzene (TeCB), trichlorobenzene (TrCB), and dichlorobenzene (DCB) isomers were detected after the decomposition reaction, indicating that the decomposition was mainly a dechlorination process. The detection of all lower chlorinated benzenes suggested the complexity of decomposition and the presence of more than one dechlorination pathway...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} reported here was to investigate in detail the fluorodechlorination of some polychloroarenes in aprotic solvents. The particular interest of this work has been directed towards: 1) The identification of minor components in the reaction products, and 2) the isolation of intermediates by competitive and consecutive reactions and the use of such sequences preoperatively. Attempts have also been made to bring about the displacement of other groups (Meo-, p-Me-C 6 H 4 -SO-O-) by fluoride ion in sulpholan (tetramethylene sulphone) as methods of preparing aryl fluorides. Detailed studies have been made of the reaction of potassium fluoride with hexachlorobenzene, <b>pentachlorobenzene,</b> fluoropentachlorobenzene, pentachlorotoluene, pentachloroanisole, pentachlorophenyl p-toluenesulphonate, fluoro- 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrachlorobenzene, 1, 2, 3, 4 -, 1, 2, 3, 5 - and 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrachlorobenzenes, tetrachlorophthaloyl chloride, 1, 3, 5 -trichloro- 2 -nitrosobenzene, 1, 3 -dichloro- 2 -nitrosobenzene and octachloronaphthalene. <p...|$|E
