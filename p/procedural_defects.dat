25|$|Whether {{judicial}} review can be excluded through executive decision remains a live issue because the 1989 {{amendments to the}} ISA reverted the law on {{judicial review}} applicable to the ISA to the date that Lee Mau Seng was decided. However, Lee Mau Seng appears to be bad law since it was overruled by the Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze. Furthermore, as a High Court decision, Lee Mau Seng {{may not be the}} final word on judicial review of action taken under the ISA. In addition, if detainees allege procedural impropriety, this allows a court to consider if there are <b>procedural</b> <b>defects</b> in the Executive's decision-making process, such as the taking into account of irrelevant considerations. Finally, ouster clauses are not barriers to judicial review in modern administrative law because courts can still step in to prevent jurisdictional errors of law.|$|E
25|$|Discretionary appeals make up {{the bulk}} of the court's docket. A {{discretionary}} appeal begins when a petition for appeal is filed with the clerk of the court. Petitions are assigned to a law clerk or staff attorney for initial research, culminating in a memorandum summarizing the pertinent facts and evaluating the legal issues raised by the petition and any brief in opposition filed in response to the petition. If the law clerk, staff attorney, or brief in opposition identify any <b>procedural</b> <b>defects</b> in the petition, it is referred to a panel of two justices who may dismiss it with or without prejudice depending {{on the nature of the}} defect. (When a petition is dismissed without prejudice, the petitioner has an opportunity to correct the procedural error and file a new petition. When a petition is dismissed with prejudice, the appeal ends and the judgment of the lower court is affirmed.) Otherwise, the case is then placed on the docket for consideration by a panel of three justices.|$|E
50|$|However, a {{procedural}} error marring the appeal proceedings does not, by itself, suffice {{to guarantee a}} successful petition. There must be a causal link between the alleged <b>procedural</b> <b>defect</b> and the damaging decision. Otherwise, the defect was not decisive and hence not fundamental.|$|R
50|$|This {{concept was}} {{especially}} important {{in the field of}} contracts.

50|$|Unlike Luros, he alleged no <b>procedural</b> <b>defect</b> in Section 1305. Instead, {{he argued}} that the entire statute was unconstitutional, since Stanley v. Georgia had held that the First Amendment {{protected}} the right to possess, read and view obscene material in the home and that allowed him to import such material for that use. The district court panel agreed, citing Thirty-seven Photographs, and struck down the statute. Again, the government appealed directly to the Supreme Court.|$|R

[...] Although the Court struck down the military commissions as created by the Executive Branch, they did not provide the detainees with direct access to the federal courts, but only with access to a fair and impartial hearing to a tribunal constitutionally authorized by Congress and proceeding with certain due process guarantees (such as one operated under terms similar to those provided by Article I courts under the UCMJ or according to the terms of the Third Geneva Convention of 1949).|$|E

50|$|A potential, and {{dangerous}} pitfall, {{is that if}} a vote involves <b>procedural</b> <b>defect,</b> it is at risk of being invalidated. This is so if any member is denied the vote, though small accidental failures may be disregarded. A person must be specified in advance to announce the ballot results, and unions may not endorse any result of the vote until that has happened. The ballot only gives four weeks' to the union to take action, though this period may be extended with the employers' consent, which is common if collective negotiations are ongoing. If all else has failed, then for industrial action to commence the union must under section 234A(4) give at least seven days notice, accompanied with details of the workers to take part.|$|R
50|$|Article 112a EPC 2000 {{introduces}} a procedure for contesting {{the decisions of}} the boards of appeal by filing a petition for review. The petition for review can only be based on a fundamental <b>procedural</b> <b>defect</b> and its purpose is not to obtain a review of the application of substantive law. The petition is in fact a restricted form of judicial review, limited to examining serious errors of procedure which might have been committed by the Legal or Technical Boards of Appeal, prejudicing the right to a fair hearing of one or more appellants. Previously it was not possible for a party who did not have his requests granted in an appeal to challenge the final decision of the Legal or Technical Board of Appeal on any grounds.|$|R
50|$|A {{second trial}} in Superior Court decided against the school, {{and the case}} {{was taken to the}} Supreme Court of Errors (now called the Connecticut Supreme Court) on appeal in July 1834. At the {{conclusion}} of this appeal, the Connecticut high court reversed the decision of the lower court, dismissing the case on July 22 because of a <b>procedural</b> <b>defect.</b> The Black Law prohibited the education of black children from outside of Connecticut unless permission was granted by the local civil authority and town selectmen. But the prosecution's information which charged Crandall had not alleged that she had established her school without the permission of the civil authority and selectmen of Canterbury. Therefore, the Supreme Court held that the information was fatally defective because the conduct which it alleged did not constitute a crime.|$|R

[...] In other words, unless the reason for an objection comes into light only in the written decision of the Board of Appeal, not raising an objection under Rule 106 EPC {{as early as possible}} during the appeal proceedings may be fatal to the admissibility of a petition for review. An objection under Rule 106 must be immediately recognizable by the Board of Appeal and it must be specific, i.e. [...] "the party must indicate unambiguously which particular defect of those listed in paragraph 2(a) to (c) of Article 112a and Rule 104 EPC it intends to rely on".|$|R

40|$|This Article {{presents}} an analysis and {{defense of the}} Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s current Eighth Amendment case law on prison sentencing. I argue that in the pivotal cases of Ewing v.

Michigan, a plurality of the Supreme Court has assimilated Eighth Amendment review of individual prison sentences to rationality review of state action under the Fourteenth Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s due process clause. When the cases are read rightly, {{it becomes clear that}} Eighth Amendment review does not really ask whether a sentence is 2 ̆ 2 grossly disproportionate, 2 ̆ 2 as the Court has asserted; rather, it seeks to identify arbitrary and capricious prison sentences that suggest a <b>procedural</b> <b>defect</b> in the sentencing process. I defend this doctrine on the grounds of original understanding, stare decisis, neutral interpretation, and normative federalism values. Finally, I show how an interpretation of Eighth Amendment prison sentencing review as rationality review can be squared with the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decisions involving constitutional proportionality review of other noncapital sanctions such as fines, punitive damages, and conditions of confinement...|$|R

40|$|I. Abstract The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{describe}} the issue of enforcement claims under execution for monetary compensation according to the Executory Code and judicial enforcement of decision under Part Six of the Civil Procedure Code. Consensus for judicial enforcement and execution, which is largely based on the regulation of judicial enforcement of decision, as the Executory Code is special to the Civil Procedure Code, made the author realize clearer interpretation of individual topics {{from the point of}} view of judicial enforcement of decision and parallelly from the view of judicial execution. Executory title is essential requirement for judicial enforcement of decision or writ of execution. However, it is not the only one prerequisite. There are other assumptions, which are requirement to the writ of enforcement and successful completion of the execution or judicial enforcement. Other essential attributes, that need to be examined, are perfection of proposal, active legitimation of the claimant, passive legitimation of the debtor, their eligibility, litispendentio or rei iudicatae etc. The absence of even only one of the conditions proceeding is a <b>procedural</b> <b>defect.</b> Execution proceedings and judicial enforcement consist of several phases. Also in the phase of own enforcement, there can be facts, which [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{confirms}} {{the existence of}} these legal process-centric themes and considers some potential implications of these approaches. Part I briefly sets out key tenets of the legal process vision and provides some back- ground to the American Innocence Movement. Using examples from relevant case law, Part II examines the courts’ approaches thematically, demonstrating how the courts exhibit loyalty to the legal process vision. It also considers the implications of this loyalty, including that it can result in both the extraction of science from its social context and an awkward approach towards discerning between credible and incredible forensic science evidence of individualization, as well as represent a failure, by the courts, to acknowledge the corrective justice function afforded to clemency by the common law. Part III concludes that these approaches to judicial decision-making ultimately fail to accept the way in which new and credible evidence – particularly forensic science evidence – can cast legitimate doubt on the verdict of a trial or, indeed, impact the proceedings of a clemency board, “quite apart from any <b>procedural</b> <b>defect.</b> ” In light of the American Innocence Movement, the courts’ largely unreserved fidelity to the legal process vision, in the context explored, is troublesome, and warrants new approaches that are more sensitive to substantive accuracy...|$|R
50|$|The Venezuelan {{claim of}} the nullity of the 1899 ruling has been {{acknowledged}} by several foreign scholars and jurists, such as J. Gillis Wetter of Sweden, {{in his work}} The International Arbitral Process (1979), awarded by the American Society of International Law. By searching on the British official archives, Wetter provided {{further evidence of the}} shady deal between Britain and Russia, what made him conclude that the ruling was marred by serious <b>procedural</b> and substantive <b>defects,</b> evidence that it was more a political compromise than a court ruling. Uruguayan jurist Eduardo Jiménez de Aréchaga, former President of the International Court of Justice, came to similar conclusions.|$|R
5000|$|A {{group of}} {{individuals}} cannot hold sovereignty, only the institution of Parliament; determining what does and {{does not constitute an}} Act of Parliament is important. This is considered a [...] "manner and form" [...] requirement. In the absence of a written constitution, it is a matter for the common law to make this determination. The court does not consider any <b>procedural</b> <b>defects</b> of the bill if they are present; this is called the [...] "enrolled Act" [...] doctrine.

50|$|In {{administrative}} law, an act may be judicially reviewable for {{ultra vires}} {{in a narrow}} or broad sense.

Either doctrine may entitle a claimant to various prerogative writs, equitable remedies or statutory orders if they are satisfied.|$|E

40|$|Para o desenvolvimento do tema, analisou-se a possibilidade de fixação de um conceito geral de invalidades, aplicável a todos os ramos do Direito. Tratou-se das especificidades das invalidades processuais, bem como de seu conceito e abrangência. Os principais critérios doutrinários para sistematização dos vícios dos atos processuais foram examinados como método auxiliar da elaboração da proposta de sistematização que compõe o objeto do presente estudo. A teoria das invalidades sofreu o impacto da acertada preocupação de que o processo não deve servir a seus próprios fins. Firmada essa concepção, nota-se uma dedicação à tarefa de realçar os limites deste aspecto instrumental, de modo a questionar a possibilidade de o exame da irrelevância do vício processual se dar pelo enfoque exclusivo de critérios exteriores à relação jurídica processual. Atualmente, a cláusula do devido processo legal incorpora a axiologia das garantias fundamentais do indivíduo, explicitando que são indispensáveis as garantias inerentes ao processo. A resolução da crise de direito {{material}} deve lançar efeitos sobre os vícios que acarretem transgressão de tais garantias, mas uma teoria das invalidades deve estar sustentada nos referenciais processuais, não podendo condicionar-se, exclusivamente, ao resultado final do processo, {{dado que}} lhe é externo. Assim, o enfoque classificatório adotado para sistematização dos vícios da sentença civil procura assentar-se sobre as regras e princípios do processo, notadamente porque se reconhece que o respeito ao direito material e ao direito processual equiparam-se em importância para que se obtenha uma decisão justa. A inexistência da sentença foi examinada sob os aspectos da decisão proferida em processo juridicamente inexistente ou pela ausência de seus elementos intrínsecos. Ao final, examinou-se a casuística relativa à sentença inválida, como aquela dada em processo com irregular constituição do juiz ou com defeito de fundamentação. Aiming {{to develop the}} theme, the analysis {{on the possibility of}} setting a general concept of invalidities, applicable to all the areas of Law was analyzed. The specificities, concept and scope of procedural invalidities were addressed. The main juristic criteria used to systematize the <b>defects</b> of <b>procedural</b> acts were analyzed as an auxiliary method for preparing the systematization proposal that comprises the subject matter of this study. The theory of invalidities was impacted by the appropriate concern about the procedure not being used as means to suit its own purpose. After establishing this concept, there is the focus on underlining the limits of this instrumental aspect to question whether the possibility of the analysis on the irrelevance of the <b>procedural</b> <b>defect</b> is focused solely on criteria that is external to the procedural legal relationship. Currently, the section of the due process of law incorporates the axiology of individual fundamental guarantees, making explicit that the guarantees inherent to the procedure are fundamental. The solution for the crisis of substantive law should impact the defects that lead to the violation of such guarantees. However, the theory of invalidities should be grounded on procedural references, and not be exclusively dependent on the final result of the process, since such theory is external to it. Accordingly, the focus on classification adopted to systematize the defects of the civil judgment intends to have as base the rules and principles of the process, since it is known that the respect toward substantive law and procedural law are of equal importance in reaching a just decision. The inexistence of the judgment was reviewed based on the aspects of the decision granted in a process that does not exist in legal terms or by the absence of its intrinsic elements. Finally, there was the analysis of case histories related to the invalid judgment, such as the judgment of a procedure with irregular constitution of the court or with defect of reasons...|$|R
40|$|Background: Percutaneous device closure is a {{therapeutic}} option {{in patients with}} presumed stroke complicating paradoxical emboli. Newer devices with lower profiles and potentially reduced thrombogenicity have emerged, such as the Premere PFO occlusion device (St Jude Medical, Inc.); there are limited data on the efficacy and procedural experience with this device. Methods: We evaluated our initial experience with the Premere device in a contemporary patient cohort, comparing the procedural and intermediate follow-up characteristics with the currently utilized Amplatzer PFO occluder. Results: Both devices were similarly effective in terms of immediate <b>procedural</b> success and <b>defect</b> closure. Procedures using the Premere device tended to be longer and required larger vascular access-sheath sizes; there were also significantly more adverse events in the Premere group (4 / 29) compared to the Amplatzer group (0 / 42; P=. 02), including 1 retroperitoneal bleed, 2 hematomas, and 1 myocardial infarction. Conclusions. While the Amplatzer device may offer advantages in terms of safety and procedural simplicity, this in part reflects the early procedural experience with this new device. The Premere and Amplatzer PFO occlusion devices are similarly effective in achieving PFO closure when applied to appropriate anatomy and should be considered complementary when performing such procedures...|$|R

5000|$|According {{to present}} doctrine, that of [...] "treaty monism", {{treaties}} {{are in the}} Dutch legal system in principle self-executing; no special transformation is needed by implementing special law, as in countries with a [...] "dualistic" [...] system (such as the United Kingdom). However, when the present articles covering this subject were last revisioned, in 1953, doctrine was divided and some defended a more dualistic position, that of [...] "limited monism". They demanded the constitution to be neutral on this issue and {{this has led to}} some infelicitous results. Government originally intended that Article 93, stating that treaties of a generally binding nature would only have such binding force after they had been published, to be simply a safeguard, protecting the citizen against duties imposed on him by such treaty. However, the [...] "limited monists" [...] held that only such published treaties are self-executing and that thus Article 93 is the basis for all treaty monism; to appease them government stated that the article should in any case be read as covering also the treaties conferring rights on the citizen and imposing duties upon government. The unintended result was that government might thus in principle withhold rights to the citizen by not publishing the treaty. Article 94 determines that legal prescripts are inapplicable if they conflict with treaties of a generally binding nature. This means that laws can be tested against treaty norms and obligations. Dutch courts have however been very reluctant to do so, limiting this to cases where government has been left no freedom of policy at all by the treaty,or to severe formal and <b>procedural</b> <b>defects.</b> The case law is very complex and contradictory, {{complicated by the fact that}} the phrase [...] "generally binding nature" [...] is assumed to have exactly the same meaning in both articles.
