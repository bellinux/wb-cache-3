40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 87 - 90) Realizing {{the need}} for the training of community health workers (CHW) in Ethiopia, a curriculum for training the CHW has been developed. This suggested curriculum is not intended to replace any of the existing training programs but rather to serve as an alternative approach for training health workers in rural Ethiopia. For this training program the author has considered the following issues necessary for planning <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> <b>worker</b> training: 1. Criteria for selection of trainees. 2. Who selects the trainees? 3. Who will train the new health workers? 4. Where will be the training site? 5. Who will be responsible for supervision of work? 6. To whom are the new trainees accountable? 7. Who will finance or support the training program? The completed curriculum includes concepts to be stressed, suggested content outlines, measurable objectives, learning opportunities, resources, evaluation procedures and guide lines. The process employed in developing the curriculum was as follows: 1. Developing the job description. 2. Translating the analyzed job description into content areas. 3. Identifying content relative to content areas and concepts. 4. Developing measurable objective. 5. Determining learning opportunities. 6. Selecting evaluative procedures. 7. Selecting resources. With the successful implementation of this a sufficient number of community health workers can be trained to meet the health manpower needs of the Ethiopian government. The proposed training curriculum provides a basis for improving public health and sanitation in rural Ethiopia...|$|E
40|$|M. Com. (Economics) Access {{to health}} care is a basic human right in South Africa. Primary health care is viewed by the South African {{government}} as the means to improving access {{to health care}} in the country. The concept of primary health care is based on the importance of first contact with a <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> <b>worker.</b> The Department of Health introduced free primary health care because it believes that the most significant barrier to access to health care is poverty. When a service is provided for free there is no income generated from user fees and the issue of funding becomes very important. This study performs an analysis of the free primary health care programme in South Africa and how it is financed. An important feature that characterizes South Africa is high inequality which is reflected in the high level ofpreventable diseases as well as high incidents of chronic diseases. The implementation of free primary health care has led to improved access to health care and somewhat improved the health status of the South African population. In order to address the inequalities in the health sector there must be funding targeted towards the needs of the poor. Government's fiscal policy places limits on the expansion of public expenditure, which poses a strain on resources flowing to the health sector. In addition to that {{there has not been a}} significant shift of funds from higher levels of care to primary health care. The funding issue will need to be urgently resolved for primary health care to be sustainable [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Infant {{mortality}} rate of Botswana has not reduced substantial {{in the last}} two decades (1990 - 2009); the HIV/AIDS epidemic has not helped the situation either. The aim of this project was to determine the major causes of infant death in Botswana and what the government is doing about it. Method: The statistical data used was from the Mortality and Morbidity report of 2006 from Department of Statistics at the Ministry of Health Botswana; literature review included several case report studies conducted by the CDC and ministry of health Botswana in early 2006 following a spike in reported infant death due to diarrhea. Several pamphlets and policy manuals in use in Botswana were also used to discuss the government efforts in reducing child death. Results: The study reveled that infant mortality is mainly caused by infectious diseases, taking account for over 67 % of causes of infant death in Botswana. Pneumonia was responsible for 21. 7 %, while diarrhea was responsible for 27. 7 % of the deaths among infants. The study also showed that the government of Botswana has introduced several programs that should reduce infant mortality, and indeed success is evident in reducing mother to child transmission of HIV through the Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV program. Conclusion: Clearly a lot more needs to be done to address the issue of infant mortality, since major causes in Botswana as well as other developing countries are preventable diseases. One of the ways is to educate the public about health and the health services available for them. Another important issue is to educate the <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> <b>worker</b> at all levels...|$|E

40|$|Background: Visual {{impairment}} is {{a public}} health problem in sub-Saharan Africa, affecting nearly 5 % of the population. Efforts to combat avoidable causes have been hampered by weak health systems and little evidence exists to suggest what interventions may be effective to improve the situation. Despite this, there are calls to promote some specific interventions, one of which being the closer integration of eye health services into health systems, often focusing on training <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> to deliver basic eye health services. This study seeks to understand how eye health services are delivered by <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> who have received training and what constraints remain to effective service provision. Methods: This was a qualitative investigation into the experiences of 20 <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> trained in <b>primary</b> eye care and eight key informants working within specialist eye health services or regional and district health management positions in two districts in Tanzania. Results: Despite feeling confident in their own eye care skills, most <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> felt constrained in the services they could provide to their communities by insufficient resources needed for diagnosis and treatment, and by lack of systematic supportive supervision to their work. Specialist ophthalmic staff were aware of this issue, although {{for the most part}} they felt it was not within their capacity to remedy and that it fell within the remit of general health managers. Many participants discussed the low support to eye health from the national government, evidenced through the lack of dedicated funding to the area and traditional reliance on outside funds including international charities. Conclusions: Although training of <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> is useful, it is recognised that is not sufficient to address the burden of eye health disease present in rural communities in Tanzania. It is likely that broader engagement with the general health system, and most likely with the private sector, will be necessary to improve the coverage of eye health care to remote and poor communities such as those in Morogoro. Further investment is needed to develop innovative approaches to delivering eye health services, including preventative, curative and rehabilitative services...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{challenges}} facing <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> care in South Africa is the delivery of quality eye care to all South Africans.

Suggestions to address the problems identified included more in-service training of <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> care <b>workers</b> regarding eye conditions, liaison with NGO’s providing eye care, decentralisation of services and the establishment of an eye care committee in the region...|$|R
40|$|Background: Primary {{dental care}} {{can be a}} way of {{achieving}} good oral health for the community. This can be achieved by integration of oral health care with the existing <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> care activities through training of <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> care <b>workers</b> on aspects of oral health. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of oral <b>health</b> education among <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> care <b>workers</b> at the <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> center (PHC) in Nellore district, Andhra Pradesh. Materials and Methods: Descriptive longitudinal study was conducted from June 2010 to August 2010 at a PHC. Knowledge about oral <b>health</b> among <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> care <b>workers</b> was pretested using a self-administered questionnaire prepared in local language (Telugu). Later after a month health education was provided to the <b>health</b> <b>workers,</b> and pamphlets with information on oral health were distributed. Posttest assessment was done 1 -month after providing health education using the same questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 12. 0 software, Student′s t-test was used to compare knowledge scores between pre and posttests. Results: A total of 118 <b>Primary</b> <b>Health</b> Care <b>Workers</b> with the majority in the 20 - 30 years age group participated in the study. Posttest assessment showed a change in knowledge level with an overall increase in knowledge level of <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> care <b>workers</b> with a mean difference of 12. 56 ± 3. 23, which was highly significant (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Background and aimsDue to {{occupational}} exposures, <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> care <b>workers</b> {{are more}} at risk of blood- borne infections such as AIDS, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the frequency of occupational injuries and its related factors among the <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> care <b>workers</b> in Bahar city. MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, conducted in 2007, 182 <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> care <b>workers</b> of Bahar city participated. Data were collected using a questionnaire and SPSS software, Chi square and Logistic regression tests were applied for data analysis. ResultsThe prevalence of occupational injuries among the participants was 57. 7 %. The highest exposure rate was associated with injection needles (84. 8 %) and the most frequent process leading to an injury was recapping (28. 6 %). The most prevalent occupational injuries were observed among lab experts (91. 6 %) and nurses (71. 4 %) (P< 0. 05). 90. 5 percent of the exposed group had only washed the injured place with soap. The risk of occupational injuries increased as the work experience increased (OR= 1. 07, CI= 1. 03 - 1. 12). There were no significant relationshipbetween employees' sex and age with occupational injuries.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to examine the views of professionals working in youth offending teams (YOTs) on a new model for providing mental health service support within the context of an interagency setting. Focus groups were used and data were analysed according to the constant comparative method. The setting consisted of two YOTs, one in an inner-city area and the other in a rural/semi-urban area, where <b>primary</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> operate at the interface between YOTs and the specialist child and adolescent mental health services. Seventeen YOT professionals participated in four focus groups. Four themes were identified: previous experiences of specialist mental health services; issues of interagency working; the role of the <b>primary</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>worker</b> within the YOT; and recommendations for the future. Overall, the clinical component of the role (assessment and intervention), and the accessibility and responsiveness of the mental health staff were consistently valued, while there were mixed responses on role definitions within the team, consultation and training.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{treatment}} of perinatal depression is a public-health priority {{because of its}} high prevalence and association with disability and poor infant development. We integrated a cognitive behaviour therapy-based intervention into the routine work of community-based <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> in rural Pakistan and assessed {{the effect of this}} intervention on maternal depression and infant outcomes. MethodsWe randomly assigned 40 Union Council clusters in rural Rawalpindi, Pakistan, in equal numbers to intervention or control. Married women (aged 16 – 45 years) in their third trimester of pregnancy with perinatal depression were eligible to participate. In the intervention group, <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> were trained to deliver the psychological intervention, whereas in the control group untrained <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> made an equal number of visits to the depressed mothers. The primary outcomes were infant weight and height at 6 months and 12 months, and secondary outcome was maternal depression. The interviewers were unaware of what group the participants were assigned to. Analysis was by intention to treat. The study is registered as ISRCTN 65316374. FindingsThe number of clusters per group was 20, with 463 mothers in the intervention group and 440 in the control group. At 6 months, 97 (23 %) of 418 and 211 (53 %) of 400 mothers in the intervention and control groups, respectively, met the criteria for major depression (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0 · 22, 95 % CI 0 · 14 to 0 · 36, p< 0 · 0001). These effects were sustained at 12 months (111 / 412 [27 %] vs 226 / 386 [59 %], adjusted OR 0 · 23, 95 % CI 0 · 15 to 0 · 36, p< 0 · 0001). The differences in weight-for-age and height-for-age Z scores for infants in the two groups were not significant at 6 months (− 0 · 83 vs − 0 · 86, p= 0 · 7 and − 2 · 03 vs − 2 · 16, p= 0 · 3, respectively) or 12 months (− 0 · 64 vs − 0 · 8, p= 0 · 3 and − 1 · 10 vs − 1 · 36, p= 0 · 07, respectively).

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} and determine the risk factors associated with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> care <b>workers</b> {{in the city of}} Vitória, Brazil. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with data collected through a survey regarding socio-demographic, occupational, clinical, and exposure characteristics, as well as knowledge about tuberculosis, conducted between 2011 and 2012. All participants underwent a tuberculin skin test (TST), and TSTs were read at 72 h by a trained professional. Results: A total of 218 <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> care <b>workers</b> participated in the study. The prevalence of TST positivity at the ≥ 10 -mm and ≥ 5 -mm cut-off points was, respectively, 39. 4 % (95 % CI: 32. 9 - 45. 9) and 54. 1 % (95 % CI: 47. 4 - 60. 7). Regarding occupational categories, community health agents had the highest proportion of TST positivity, regardless of the cut-off point (≥ 10 mm: 47. 5 %; and ≥ 5 mm: 60. 5 %). Regarding factors associated with TST results, “having had a previous TST” showed a statistically significant association with TST positivity at the ≥ 10 -mm and ≥ 5 -mm cut-off points (OR = 2. 5 [95 % CI: 1. 17 - 5. 30] and OR = 2. 18 [95 % CI: 1. 23 - 3. 87], respectively). Conclusions: The prevalence of LTBI was found to be high among the <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> care <b>workers</b> in this sample. Therefore, we recommend the establishment of a periodic screening program for LTBI and implementation of effective biosafety policies for the prevention of this infection among <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> care <b>workers...</b>|$|R

In addition, health system barriers such as lack of staff, lack of medicine and lack of financial motivation were identified as key reasons for the low uptake of the devices. CONCLUSIONS: The ALMANACH built on electronic devices was perceived to be a powerful and useful tool. However, health system challenges influenced the uptake of the devices in the selected health facilities...|$|R
40|$|Mortality and {{morbidity}} from malaria {{were measured}} in children for a one-year period {{in a rural}} area of The Gambia 3 - 4 years after the introduction of a <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> care programme into some villages in the study area. Among children resident in <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> care villages who received treatment for febrile illnesses from a village <b>health</b> <b>worker</b> resident in their village there was no reduction in overall mortality or in morbidity from malaria compared with levels found in villages without a <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> care <b>worker.</b> However, among children aged 3 - 59 months who received malaria chemoprophylaxis from a village <b>health</b> <b>worker</b> in addition to treatment there was a 49 % reduction in mortality and a 73 % reduction in attacks of clinical malaria. The level of protection against malaria achieved by chemoprophylaxis given by village <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> 3 - 4 years after the chemoprophylaxis programme was started was as high as that obtained shortly after the introduction of the <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> care programme...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{need for}} chronic disease {{self-management}} (CDS-M) is increasing worldwide. CDS-M programs are variably effective for vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals. Objectives: The objects {{of this study}} were 1) To explore experiences of <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> leading CDS-M programs for vulnerable and disadvantaged populations, and 2) To develop guiding principles for the delivery of more effective CDS-M programs for vulnerable and disadvantaged populations. Methods: Two focus groups were undertaken, with all <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> <b>workers,</b> and allied <b>health</b> (AH) staff in a large community centre in an Australian city, who worked with vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals with chronic disease. Results: Consistent messages were identified, producing nine guiding principles. Self-management programs / messages should be tailored to cultural groups, learning styles and available supports, cultural sensitivities, group leadership requirements, language, literacy levels, belief systems and social circumstances and supports, past experiences, and individuals’ ability to motivate change. Implications: The draft guiding principles may assist others to deliver more effective CDS-M programs for disadvantaged and vulnerable populations...|$|R
40|$|ABTRACT Many persons {{suffering}} psychotic illnesses, such as schizophrenia, {{are largely}} untreated in low income countries. In these settings, most persons with severe mental illness {{live with their}} families. Thus, families play a particular critical role in determining whether {{a person with a}} psychotic illness will receive treatment and what the quality of treatment. Psychoeducation has proven to be extremely effective in helping families develop the knowledge and skills which is necessary to help their family members. Indonesia has a national policy to integrate the management of mental health problems into the <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> care system. However, in practice, such care does not implemented effectively. A preliminary study in <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> centers in two districts of Bantul and Gunung Kidul regency, Yogyakarta province, showed that there was very little or there is not any training for <b>health</b> care <b>workers</b> on diagnosis and treatment of psychotic disorder. This study was conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the training program for <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> in three <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> centers in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, to provide psychoeducation to family caregivers for persons with psychotic disorder. A quasi-experimental study with the approach of one group pre and posttest design was performed in this study. Fortythree <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> in 3 <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> centers in Bantul and Gunung Kidul, Yogyakarta were trained every week for a month to provide psychoeducation to family caregivers who live with psychotic disorder patient. Result showed that the baseline score of knowledge of schizophrenia among <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> in 3 <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> centers in Bantul and Gunung Kidul before training were not significantly different (p= 0. 162). After the psychoeducation training program there were significantly different (p= 0. 003) of the score of knowledge of schizophrenia among <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> in 3 <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> care centers compared with before training. For conclusion, the training program to provide psychoeducation to family care providers of persons with psychotic disorder for <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> was effective to increase their knowledge of schizophrenia...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to obtain {{information}} on the dietary knowledge of <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> care <b>workers</b> and on their ability to apply this knowledge in practice. A total of 128 <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> care <b>workers</b> (53 general practitioners and 61 nurses) in 12 practices and 14 primary care facilitators were surveyed by questionnaire between December 1987 and June 1988. All of the practices were participating in a project to promote prevention in primary care and offered health checks designed to identify and deal with cardiovascular risk factors. The questionnaire focused on issues related to managing patients with moderate hypercholesterolaemia. The results of the study showed some important gaps in the health workers' knowledge [...] for example, only 91 understood that dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids as a proportion of total fat intake should be increased in a diet designed to reduce serum lipid concentrations. Appreciable gaps in their ability to give practical and appropriate dietary advice were also identified: 35 gave advice that would have led to the patient losing weight (although his history indicated that he was not overweight), and 27 gave only negative advice, offering no suggestions about substituting healthy foods for unhealthy ones. The demand for <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> care <b>workers</b> to give dietary advice is increasing and is likely to increase further if a national screening programme for hypercholesterolaemia is recommended. The results of this survey point to a need for improved nutritional education and training in dietary counselling for general practitioners, nurses, and primary care facilitators...|$|R
