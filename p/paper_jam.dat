5|$|During a Nintendo Treehouse Live webcast at E3 2017, {{a remake}} of Superstar Saga for Nintendo 3DS, titled Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions, was announced. The port {{features}} updated graphics, maintaining the use of sprites but with additional lighting effects, akin to Dream Team and <b>Paper</b> <b>Jam.</b> The port also adds an additional storyline, Minion Quest: The Search for Bowser, which follows Captain Goomba and features different gameplay mechanics. The game also features Amiibo functions, tied to the existing Boo and new Goomba and Koopa Troopa figures. The game was released worldwide on October 6, 2017.|$|E

50|$|Mario & Luigi: <b>Paper</b> <b>Jam,</b> {{known in}} Europe and Australia as Mario & Luigi: <b>Paper</b> <b>Jam</b> Bros., is a {{role-playing}} video game developed by AlphaDream {{and published by}} Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS. The game is the fifth title in the Mario & Luigi series, crossing over with elements and style of characters from the Paper Mario series. It was released internationally in December 2015, and in North America the following month.|$|E
50|$|Common {{applications}} of micro switches include the door interlock on a microwave oven, levelling and safety switches in elevators, vending machines, and to detect <b>paper</b> <b>jams</b> or other faults in photocopiers.

50|$|Typically, users {{approach}} their artifacts {{with very different}} competencies. The Semantic Turn offers the possibility of accommodating these differences by allowing the design of several semantic layers. For example, contemporary Xerox machines exhibit one layer for making copies, another for clearing <b>paper</b> <b>jams,</b> a third for replacing defective parts by trained service personnel, and a fourth is reserved for the factory repair of replaced components.|$|R

This can be repaired by {{replacement of the}} front fuser door. The engine over all is reliable. Problems such as <b>paper</b> <b>jams</b> can be fixed by replacement of pickup rollers located under the toner cartridge, replacement of the fuser door, checking if the paper separation paws are not bent, and replacement of the delivery rollers.|$|R

2500|$|A {{miniature}} snap-action switch, also trademarked {{and frequently}} {{known as a}} micro switch, is an electric switch that is actuated by very little physical force, {{through the use of}} a tipping-point mechanism, sometimes called an [...] "over-center" [...] mechanism. Common applications of micro switches include the door interlock on a microwave oven, levelling and safety switches in elevators, vending machines, and to detect <b>paper</b> <b>jams</b> or other faults in photocopiers. The miniature snap-action switch was invented in 1932 by Peter McGall, who was an employee of the Burgess Battery Company in Freeport, Illinois.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the story}} of how the xerographic copier, or “Xerox machine,” became a {{creative}} medium for artists and activists during the last few decades of the twentieth century. <b>Paper</b> <b>jams,</b> mangled pages, and even fires made early versions of this clunky office machine a source of fear, rage, dread, and disappointment. But eventually, xerography democratized print culture by making it convenient and affordable for renegade publishers, zinesters, artists, punks, anarchists, queers, feminists, street activists, and others to publish their work and to get their messages out on the street. The xerographic copier adjusted the lived and imagined margins of society, Eichhorn argues, by supporting artistic and political expression and mobilizing subcultural movements.

5000|$|Dot matrix impact {{printers}} {{are more}} tolerant of the hot and dirty operating conditions found in many industrial settings. This allows them {{to be used in}} settings such as restaurant or cafeteria kitchens to print out orders sent from the POS terminals. The Epson tm-u220b printer is an example of one currently found in kitchens worldwide. These printers are used in kitchens because they do not require thermal paper, which would be darkened by any nearby heat sources such as ovens. The simplicity and durability of the design, as well as its similarity to older typewriter technology, allows users who are not [...] "computer literate" [...] to easily perform routine tasks such as changing ribbons and correcting <b>paper</b> <b>jams.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first {{appearance}} of a friendly Paper Boo who fought on Paper Mario's side was Lady Bow from the first Paper Mario game.

5000|$|The game {{received}} generally positive reviews. <b>Paper</b> <b>Jam</b> {{holds an}} aggregate score of 76/100 on Metacritic, indicating [...] "generally favorable" [...] reviews. Polygon awarded it 6.5 out of 10, saying [...] "Those {{desperate for a}} dose of Mario could do far worse, but it's hard to look inside this machine without seeing what's gotten tangled up inside." [...] Destructoid awarded it 8 out of 10, saying [...] "While it sometimes holds your hand for a little too long and at times fails to take proper risks, it was consistently polished, enjoyable and memorable." [...] GameSpot awarded it a score of 6 out of 10, saying [...] "As Dream Team and Sticker Star proved, Nintendo {{has a knack for}} showcasing new and inventive ideas in both series. <b>Paper</b> <b>Jam</b> effectively relies (and often coasts) on its novel crossover appeal. Bold experimentation will have to wait, perhaps in an installment where, conversely, Mario and Luigi visit Paper Mario’s world." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{sequel to}} Partners in Time (or Superstar Saga) was {{announced}} at the Nintendo Conference on October 2, 2008, titled Bowser's Inside Story.

Dream Team was released in Europe, Australia, and Japan in July 2013 and in North America in August 2013. <b>Paper</b> <b>Jam,</b> a crossover with the Paper Mario series, was released in December 2015 in Japan, Europe and Australia and in January 2016 in North America.|$|E
60|$|The drawer was of {{considerable}} length. When {{he tried to}} pull it completely out from the grooves in which it ran, it resisted him. In his present frame of mind, this was a suspicious circumstance in itself. He cleared away the litter {{so as to make}} room for the introduction of his hand and arm into the drawer. In another moment his fingers touched a piece of <b>paper,</b> <b>jammed</b> between the inner end of the drawer and the bottom of the flat surface of the washhand-stand.

50|$|Impact {{printers}} create noise {{when the}} pins or typeface strike the ribbon to the paper, and sound-damping enclosures {{may have to}} be used in quiet environments. They can only print lower-resolution graphics, with limited color performance, limited quality, and lower speeds compared to non-impact printers. While they support fanfold paper with tractor holes well, single-sheet paper {{may have to be}} wound in and aligned by hand, which is relatively time-consuming, or a sheet feeder may be utilized which can have a lower paper feed reliability. When printing labels on release paper, they are prone to <b>paper</b> <b>jams</b> when a print wire snags {{the leading edge of the}} label while printing at its very edge. For text-only labels (e.g. mailing labels), a daisy wheel printer or band printer may offer better print quality and a lower risk of damaging the paper.|$|R
50|$|The Mario & Luigi series {{began with}} the release of Superstar Saga for the Game Boy Advance in 2003. In 2005, Partners in Time for the Nintendo DS {{introduced}} their younger selves: Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Baby Toadsworth, Baby Peach and Baby Bowser. In 2009, Bowser's Inside Story also for the DS introduced Mario, Luigi and the others inside of Bowser's body. In 2013, Dream Team for the Nintendo 3DS introduced Dreamy Luigi, where Luigi sleeps in the Dream World in celebrating the Year of Luigi. In 2015, <b>Paper</b> <b>Jam</b> also for the 3DS introduced a crossover game, where Luigi knocks over a book and unleashed the paper characters of the Paper Mario world.|$|E

5000|$|Printers that {{exhibit the}} [...] "accordion" [...] or [...] "washboard" [...] <b>paper</b> <b>jam</b> {{problem with the}} paper tightly concertina'd or folded in the exit paper path (often behind the rear access door) {{generally}} have problems with the paper exit mechanism. In many cases, the delivery rollers (upper and lower) in the upper or final stage of the paper exit are worn or unserviceable. Replacement kits for these rollers are easily obtainable and can solve the problem.An alternative is to enlarge the roller slightly by using heat shrink over the output rollers. The heat shrink extra diameter pulls the paper quicker and resolves the wear/slip issues. Another alternative is to use coarse quality abrasive paper such as those used by belt sanders to roughen the surfaces of the rollers. A quality abrasive is needed to ensure no particles are shed into the mechanism.|$|E

50|$|Nintendo {{released}} Partners in Time, the prequel/sequel to Superstar Saga, on November 28, 2005 for the Nintendo DS system. The {{plot and}} setting is relatively disconnected {{to that of}} Superstar Saga, as Cackletta {{has been replaced by}} the Shroobs as the primary antagonists. Although the game is set outside the Beanbean Kingdom, there are references to Superstar Saga in Partners in Time, such as the inclusion of Fawful in the sewers of Princess Peach's Castle in the game. The Bros. Moves have been retained in Partners in Time, although they involve an item system as opposed to the Bros. Points system that Superstar Saga has. A second sequel, Bowser's Inside Story, was released in 2009 for the Nintendo DS, with Fawful reprising his role as a key villain. A third sequel, Dream Team, was released in 2013 for the Nintendo 3DS. A fourth sequel, <b>Paper</b> <b>Jam,</b> a crossover with the Paper Mario series, was originally released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2015.|$|E
5000|$|LocoScript {{allowed the}} user to edit one {{document}} while printing another, so that the relative slowness of the bundled dot matrix printer seldom caused difficulties. Users could ask for all of a document to be printed or a range of pages, set the print quality to [...] "high quality" [...] or [...] "draft", and set the paper used to single-sheet or continuous stationery. LocoScript automatically adjusted the size of margins so that {{the same number of}} lines per page appeared on both single-sheet and continuous stationery. Since the printer only accepted one sheet of single-sheet paper at a time, LocoScript displayed a prompt {{at the end of each}} page when in single-sheet mode. The program also had the ability to resume at a specified page after a <b>paper</b> <b>jam.</b> In addition to printing LocoScript documents, the program had a [...] "direct printing" [...] mode which operated like a typewriter, printing each piece of text after the user pressed RETURN. This could be used for completing forms.|$|E
50|$|Goombas {{appear in}} each of the Mario {{role-playing}} games. Super Mario RPG introduces the first non-hostile Paper Goombas, while the follow-up game Paper Mario introduces a Goomba village, and a playable Paper Goomba character called Goombario. A second playable Paper Goomba is introduced in The Thousand-Year Door called Goombella. Goombas also appear in the 4 Mario & Luigi titles: Superstar Saga, Partners in Time, Bowser's Inside Story, and Dream Team. The Goombas meets their paper counterparts, Paper Goombas, in a Paper Mario and Mario & Luigi crossover game, Mario & Luigi: <b>Paper</b> <b>Jam.</b> Bowser's Inside Story features goomba-form cells who think Mario and company are viruses, and outside Bowser's body, they are used in one of Bowser's special attacks. Goombas have appeared in several other spin-off titles {{in and out of the}} Mario series, including the second and 3rd titles of the Super Smash Bros. series, Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Brawl. They have a playable appearance in Mario baseball video games such as Mario Superstar Baseball and Mario Super Sluggers. Goombas are also obstacles in various Mario Kart courses.|$|E

5000|$|In November 1996 HP {{introduced}} the network-ready LaserJet 5Si, a major revision and upgrade to the 3Si (IIISi) and 4Si, which {{had used the}} Canon NX engine. The 5Si, based on the Canon WX engine, could thus provide 11"x17" [...] printing at an unprecedented 24 pages per minute and at 600 dpi with resolution enhancement. An internal duplexer enabled full-speed double-sided printing. Automatic personality switching (between PCL and PostScript), a feature that first appeared on the 4SiMX, was standard on the 5SiMX. The 5Si series were true workhorses, but initial models were somewhat hobbled by a vulnerability to slightly low voltage (i.e. crashing if mains voltage was less than 120 Volts) {{as well as a}} weak clutch in Tray 3 (thus resulting in <b>paper</b> <b>jamming</b> for Tray 3 as well as the optional 2,000-sheet Tray 4), and also a weak solenoid in the manual feed tray (Tray 1). These paper-handling issues were easily dealt with. Many 5Si LaserJets remain in service today. The Color LaserJet 5 and 5M were introduced in March 1996, with 1200 dpi resolution. In October 1996 HP introduced its first printers in the LaserJet 6 range, the 6P and 6 MP, both aimed at small offices. They included infrared technology, for wireless printing. In November 1996 the HP 5Si Mopier was introduced, claimed to be the first network printers optimized to produce multiple original prints (mopies). It had a 100 000 copies per month duty cycle, and 24 ppm print speed.|$|R
30|$|We {{conclude}} by reiterating {{that our}} {{findings in this}} <b>paper</b> presents cooperative <b>jamming</b> as an enabler for secrecy from an internal eavesdropper, and motivates further investigation of such cooperation ideas in more general settings including those in larger networks. We also comment whether and when cooperative jamming actually yields the secrecy capacity (region) for various multiuser channels remain open problems in information theory.|$|R
50|$|Mario {{games of}} other genres include various Game & Watch games; Mario Pinball Land, a pinball {{game for the}} Game Boy Advance; various {{educational}} games; and the Dr. Mario puzzle video game, (with Dr. Mario itself first released in 1990).

50|$|The Koopalings have {{appeared}} as boss {{characters in the}} spin-off Mario games Yoshi's Safari, Mario is Missing!, and Hotel Mario, released from 1992 to 1994 on various platforms. They then appeared in the 2003 Game Boy Advance video game Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, where they served as bosses in Bowser's Castle, the last area of the game. They {{were supposed to be}} included in the Nintendo DS game Super Princess Peach but were cut for unknown reason, and only leftover sprites remain in the game. In Mario Kart 8 for the Wii U in 2014, the Koopalings made their debut as playable characters for the first time. In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, each of Bowser Jr.'s seven alternate costumes replaces him with one of the Koopalings, with each one fighting from atop the Junior Clown Car.

40|$|Abstract—In this <b>paper,</b> a <b>jamming</b> {{cancelation}} approach {{based on}} the concept of pulse diversity is proposed to suppress some newer complicated digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) range false targets (RFT). Just repeating the intercepted radar electromagnetic signal, as done in the conventional re-transmitting jammer, is not effective because only one range false target is produced. In contrast, the newer DRFM-based RFT generation methods, especially chopping and interleaving (C&I) and smeared spectrum (SMSP) can yield a multi-lobe filter output by transforming the internal structure of the intercepted radar signal. The presented approach to overcome this challenge is {{based on the}} temporal pulse diversity technique, and it does not require parameter estimation of the jamming signal. By transmitting pulses with specific transmission pulse block and the following proper processing, it can cancel out the protruding spikes of the jammer at the price of an acceptable performance loss. Particularly, this method is applicable to broad DRFM repeat jammer in electronic warfare (EW) area. 1...|$|R
