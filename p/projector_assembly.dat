5000|$|The AQS-13 {{systems are}} all {{primarily}} active sonar transmitting {{in the upper}} end of the medium frequency sonar range. These systems offered the additional capabilities of voice communication, bathythermography and rudimentary passive sonar. Helicopter borne active sonar has significant advantages over other sensors and is especially effective in the inner zone where noise from the ships of the carrier battle group can interfere with passive sensors. The components of the AQS-13 are informally divided into two groups, the [...] "wet end" [...] and [...] "dry end." [...] The [...] "dry end" [...] involves the processing of the acoustic signals to obtain tactical data. The [...] "wet end" [...] components are those necessary to deploy the acoustic unit into the ocean and retrieve it. These [...] "wet" [...] components include the acoustic elements in a submersible unit, the reel & cable and reeling machine. The hydrophone and projector elements are housed within the submersible unit or transducer. The transducer, also called the [...] "dome", a term borrowed from ship-board sonars, is lowered or [...] "dipped" [...] from the helicopter on a cable by means of the hydraulic reeling machine. The dip depth of the transducer is selected by the operator to achieve the maximum detection probability at the dip location on that particular day as determined by the study of ocean conditions (see Underwater Acoustics). During active search, the acoustic pulse is emitted from the <b>projector</b> <b>assembly.</b> Echos or [...] "returns" [...] are received by the hydrophone, routed through the sonar cable, processed in the aircraft and displayed on a cathode ray tube (CRT) in a plan position indicator (PPI) format. Returns were also processed and made available to the RO-358 chart recorder in the AQS-13E and earlier systems. This data was made available to the aircraft tactical computer in the AQS-13F. The various functions were selectable by the operator, such as pulse lengths, range scales and other modes to enhance operations for the particular conditions. Sensor elements on the reeling machine monitor the relative angle of the deployed sonar cable and provide flight reference signals to the aircraft stabilization equipment in order to maintain a steady hover position over the submerged transducer. Tactical data of the target is obtained from the acoustic returns, including range, bearing and relative speed. Later versions of the AQS-13 were also capable of processing acoustic signals transmitted to the aircraft from sonobuoys.|$|E
40|$|Compact vision testing {{apparatus}} is described for testing {{a large number}} of physiological characteristics of the eyes and visual system of a human subject. The head of the subject is inserted into a viewing port at one end of a light-tight housing containing various optical assemblies. Visual acuity and other refractive characteristics and ocular muscle balance characteristics of the eyes of the subject are tested by means of a retractable phoroptor assembly carried near the viewing port and a film cassette unit carried in the rearward portion of the housing (the latter selectively providing a variety of different visual targets which are viewed through the optical system of the phoroptor assembly). The visual dark adaptation characteristics and absolute brightness threshold of the subject are tested by means of a <b>projector</b> <b>assembly</b> which selectively projects one or both of a variable intensity fixation target and a variable intensity adaptation test field onto a viewing screen located {{near the top of the}} housing...|$|E
50|$|The trichroic prism {{assembly}} {{can be used}} {{in reverse}} to combine red, green and blue beams into a coloured image, and is used in this way in some <b>projector</b> devices. <b>Assemblies</b> with more than 3 beams are possible.|$|R
50|$|Staff and {{students}} often {{worked together to}} build or improve college facilities during this period. Their work included formation of the Tom Graham Cricket Oval in 1931, and the 1930 relocation by students using horses and tractors, of a timber grandstand, erected in 1927 on a sports ground {{near the site of}} the present War Memorial Swimming Pool, to a more appropriate location overlooking the planned new oval. In the early 1930s the Gymnasium was lined with silky-oak and walnut milled and installed by students. In 1935 this building was extended in length, new dressing rooms were constructed either side of the re-erected stage, and the interior was lined to match the existing hall. Used variously as a gymnasium, theatre, cinema (a cinematograph projector was installed in 1927, and replaced by a Movietown Sound <b>Projector</b> in 1931), <b>assembly</b> hall, recreation hall, chapel, and currently as a lecture room, the building was re-located in 1978 to a site between the inner and outer ring roads on {{the western edge of the}} campus.|$|R
