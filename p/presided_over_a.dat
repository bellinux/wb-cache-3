5|$|The urban {{district}} council <b>presided</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> {{huge increase in}} population as the Metropolitan Railway gave rise to many new development opportunities. This created many challenges to improve public services and housing while preserving the area's heritage sites.

5|$|After Congress adjourned on August 6, 1861, Burnett {{returned}} home to Cadiz and spoke {{at a number of}} pro-Southern rallies. On September 4, 1861, Confederate Major General Leonidas Polk violated Kentucky's neutrality by ordering Brigadier General Gideon Johnson Pillow to occupy Columbus. In response, Ulysses S. Grant captured Paducah on September 6, 1861. With neutrality no longer a tenable option, Burnett <b>presided</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> conference of Kentucky's Southern sympathizers that occurred at Russellville between October 29 and October 31, 1861. The self-appointed delegates to this conference called for a sovereignty convention on November 18, 1861 for the purpose of establishing a Confederate government for the state.|$|E
5|$|Besides championing the Southern {{cause in}} Congress, Burnett also worked within Kentucky {{to bolster the}} state's support of the Confederacy. He <b>presided</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> {{sovereignty}} convention in Russellville in 1861 that formed a Confederate government for the state. The delegates to this convention chose Burnett to travel to Richmond, Virginia to secure Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy. Burnett also raised a Confederate regiment at Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and briefly served in the Confederate States Army. Camp Burnett, a Confederate recruiting post two miles west of Clinton in Hickman County, Kentucky, was named after him.|$|E

5|$|Catherine {{believed}} in the humanist ideal of the learned Renaissance prince whose authority depended on letters as well as arms. She {{was inspired by the}} example of her father-in-law, King Francis I of France, who had hosted the leading artists of Europe at his court, and by her Medici ancestors. In an age of civil war and declining respect for the monarchy, she sought to bolster royal prestige through lavish cultural display. Once in control of the royal purse, she launched a programme of artistic patronage that lasted for three decades. During this time, she <b>presided</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> distinctive late French Renaissance culture in all branches of the arts.|$|E
5|$|Judge Green <b>presided</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} notable cases during his 35-year tenure on the Eastern District. In Bolden v. Pennsylvania State Police Judge Green ordered the Pennsylvania State Police to {{reinstate}} William Bolden, a minority trooper {{who had been}} dismissed. The case, which began in 1973, resulted in a consent decree that required the State Police to hire one minority for every non-minority hired, and set additional goals for promotion and retention of minority troopers. Judge Green presided over the consent decree for 25 years, dissolving it in 1999. The case was credited with helping to abolish racism in the hiring of troopers, and integrate the State Police.|$|E
5|$|On 17 September 1595 Clement VIII had {{accepted}} the decision of Henry IV of France to convert to the Catholic Church, which Henry had previously made to secure the French monarchy, and <b>presided</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> ceremony of papal absolution.

The Spanish faction had previously opposed the pope taking these actions, but the French negotiators had talked {{of the possibility of}} schism, which along with Henry's victories in the French Wars of Religion, overcame their opposition.|$|E

The gathering was held {{in full view of}} the villagers, and marked the first time that Đujić publicly donned a Chetnik uniform. This consisted of World War I-era Serbian Army battledress and a black lambswool cap known as a šubara, with skull and crossbones insignia. On 6 September 1935, Đujić formed a Chetnik organisation in Vrlika. Several months later, he assembled a band of 70 Chetniks in the villages of Otrić and Velika Popina.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Sabri al-Asali {{resigned}} {{from his post}} on 6 September following the Ba'ath Party's withdrawal from the cabinet. As a result, Quwatli attempted to nominate Lutfi al-Haffar as Prime Minister, but reneged after opposition from the Ba'athists. Afterward, Quwatli asked Rushdi al-Kikhiya to form a cabinet, but the latter refused, citing that influence from the Syrian Army would deprive his government of real power. President Nasser of Egypt recommended the reappointment of Asali, but Quwatli refused, instead opting for Said al-Ghazzi, an independent. Ghazzi agreed and subsequently <b>presided</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> national unity government.|$|E
5|$|The Uruguayan War (10 August 1864– 20 February 1865) {{was fought}} between Uruguay's {{governing}} Blanco Party and an alliance {{consisting of the}} Empire of Brazil and the Uruguayan Colorado Party, covertly supported by Argentina. Since its independence, Uruguay had been ravaged by intermittent struggles between the Colorado and Blanco factions, each attempting to seize and maintain power in turn. The Colorado leader Venancio Flores launched the Liberating Crusade in 1863, an insurrection aimed at toppling Bernardo Berro, who <b>presided</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> Colorado–Blanco coalition (fusionist) government. Flores was aided by Argentina, whose president Bartolomé Mitre provided him with supplies, Argentine volunteers and river transport for troops.|$|E

5|$|As Allen's {{first-class}} career {{came to a}} close, {{he moved}} into administration and held considerable influence in English and world cricket. He {{was instrumental in the}} creation of a MCC coaching manual, and worked hard to eliminate illegal bowling actions. As chairman of selectors from 1955 to 1961, he <b>presided</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> period of great success for English cricket, during which he worked closely with the Test captain Peter May. In 1963, he became MCC president, and was made the club's treasurer the following year. In this role, he was deeply involved in the D'Oliveira affair, a controversy over the potential selection of Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa. After Allen's gradual retirement from his administrative roles, he was knighted in 1986 and spent his later years in a flat close to Lord's Cricket Ground, where he died, aged 87, in 1989.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Banda's Malawi Congress Party (MCP) {{gained a}} {{majority}} in the Legislative Council elections and Banda became Prime Minister in 1963. The Federation was dissolved in 1963, and on 6 July 1964, Nyasaland became independent from British rule and renamed itself Malawi. Under a new constitution, Malawi became a republic with Banda as its first president. The new document also formally made Malawi a one-party state with the MCP as the only legal party. In 1971, Banda was declared president-for-life. For almost 30 years, Banda <b>presided</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> rigidly authoritarian regime, which ensured that Malawi did not suffer armed conflict. Opposition parties, including the Malawi Freedom Movement of Orton Chirwa and the Socialist League of Malawi, were founded in exile.|$|E

5|$|While in government, Disraeli <b>presided</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> {{series of}} social reforms which {{supported}} his one-nation politics and aimed {{to create a}} benevolent hierarchy. He appointed a Royal Commission to assess the state of law between employers and employees, the result of which prompted Richard Cross to pass the Employers and Workmen Act of 1875. This act made both sides of industry equal before {{the law and the}} breach of contract a civil offence, rather than criminal. Cross also passed the Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act in the same year which enshrined the right to strike of workers by ensuring that acts carried out by a workers' group could not be indicted as conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|After the Indian Army was {{withdrawn}} from France, Blackader was posted to a second-line Territorial Force brigade {{training in the}} United Kingdom. In 1916, it was sent to Dublin during the Easter Rising; following the Rising, Blackader <b>presided</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> number of the resulting courts-martial, including those {{of several of the}} signatories to the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. Later that year, he was ordered to France to take over command of the 38th (Welsh) Division, a New Army formation which had suffered heavy losses in the Battle of the Somme. He remained with the division for almost two years, helping retrain and reorganise it as an efficient fighting unit. The division would see significant successes in the Hundred Days Offensive of late 1918, but by this point Blackader was no longer in command; he had been invalided home earlier in the year. He died shortly after the war, in 1921, aged 51.|$|E
5|$|After the Khmer Republic {{fell to the}} Khmer Rouge on 17 April 1975, a {{new regime}} under its charge, Democratic Kampuchea, was formed. Sihanouk was {{appointed}} as its Head of State, a ceremonial position. In September 1975, Sihanouk briefly returned to Cambodia to inter the ashes of his mother, before going abroad again to lobby for diplomatic recognition of Democratic Kampuchea. He returned on 31December 1975 and <b>presided</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> meeting to endorse the constitution of Democratic Kampuchea. In February 1976 Khieu Samphan took him on a tour across the Cambodian countryside. Sihanouk {{was shocked to see}} the use of forced labour and population displacement carried out by the Khmer Rouge government, known as the Angkar. Following the tour, Sihanouk decided to resign as the Head of State. The Angkar initially rejected his resignation request, though they subsequently accepted it in mid-April 1976, retroactively backdating it to 2April 1976.|$|E
5|$|Each {{state is}} divided into {{judicial}} districts <b>presided</b> <b>over</b> by <b>a</b> District and Sessions Judge.
