5|$|Additionally, for an implant to look esthetic, {{a band of}} full, plump gingiva {{is needed}} {{to fill in the}} space on either side of implant. The most common soft tissue {{complication}} is called a black-triangle, where the <b>papilla</b> (the small triangular piece of tissue between two teeth) shrinks back and leaves a triangular void between the implant and the adjacent teeth. Dentists can only expect 2–4mm of <b>papilla</b> height over the underlying bone. A black triangle can be expected if the distance between where the teeth touch and bone is any greater.|$|E
5|$|During evolution, darts {{appear to}} have been lost secondarily, i.e., after they had evolved and been functional. Vestigial darts (ones that exist only in a {{rudimentary}} condition) occur in the family Sagdidae, and in many Helicoidea, the surrounding organs have also degenerated (become non-functional). The sarcobelum is a fleshy or cuticle-coated <b>papilla</b> which {{is considered to be a}} degenerated, previously dart-bearing, organ.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{can hear}} {{both in the}} air and below water. They do not have {{external}} ears; the eardrums (tympanic membranes) are directly exposed or may be covered by a layer of skin and are visible as a circular area just behind the eye. The size and distance apart of the eardrums is related to the frequency and wavelength at which the frog calls. In some species such as the bullfrog, the size of the tympanum indicates the sex of the frog; males have tympani that are larger than their eyes while in females, the eyes and tympani are much the same size. A noise causes the tympanum to vibrate and the sound is transmitted to the middle and inner ear. The middle ear contains semicircular canals which help control balance and orientation. In the inner ear, the auditory hair cells are arranged in two areas of the cochlea, the basilar <b>papilla</b> and the amphibian <b>papilla.</b> The former detects high frequencies and the latter low frequencies. Because the cochlea is short, frogs use electrical tuning to extend their range of audible frequencies and help discriminate different sounds. This arrangement enables detection of the territorial and breeding calls of their conspecifics. In some species that inhabit arid regions, the sound of thunder or heavy rain may arouse them from a dormant state. A frog may be startled by an unexpected noise but it will not usually take any action until it has located the source of the sound by sight.|$|E

40|$|The {{morphology}} of the dorsal lingual <b>papillae</b> of {{the adult}} Goitered gazelle was examined by scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy. On the dorsal surface of the lingual mucosa, three types of mechanical <b>papillae</b> and two types of gustatory <b>papillae</b> were observed. Numerous filiform <b>papillae</b> covered the entire surface of the lingual apex and body except for the lingual torus of the dorsal lingual surface. The structure and size of filiform <b>papillae</b> vary in the apex and body parts of the tongue.

40|$|The dorsal lingual <b>papillae</b> of {{the lesser}} mouse deer were studied morphologically using light and {{scanning}} electron microscopy. Four types of <b>papillae,</b> filiform, fungiform, vallate and foliate, were observed. Filiform <b>papillae</b> consisted of larger main <b>papillae</b> with smaller secondary <b>papillae</b> on their anterolateral aspects. Secondary <b>papillae</b> were well distributed over the anterior {{two-thirds of the}} tongue, but were very rare or absent in the posterior third. Fungiform <b>papillae</b> were distributed among the filiform <b>papillae,</b> being larger and more abundant {{on the tip of}} the tongue. Vallate <b>papillae</b> were round-flat or long-flat, surrounded by a prominent circular groove and a thin annular pad. An important finding was the presence of distinct and prominent foliate <b>papillae</b> on the posterolateral sides of the tongue. Keratinisation of the covering stratified squamous epithelium was relatively weak. Taste buds were observed in the epithelium of the fungiform, vallate and foliate <b>papillae.</b> The lingual <b>papillae</b> of the lesser mouse deer showed some characteristics that differed from those reported for domestic ruminants. These {{may be related to the}} feeding habits and the type of food eaten by this species. Key words: Ruminants; tragulina; tongue. MATERIALS AND METHOD...|$|R
5|$|Food {{impaction}} {{occurs when}} food debris, especially fibrous food such as meat, becomes trapped between two teeth and is {{pushed into the}} gums during chewing. The usual cause of food impaction is disruption of the normal interproximal contour or drifting of teeth so that a gap is created (an open contact). Decay can lead to collapse of part of the tooth, or a dental restoration may not accurately reproduce the contact point. Irritation, localized discomfort or mild pain {{and a feeling of}} pressure from between the two teeth results. The gingival <b>papilla</b> is swollen, tender and bleeds when touched. The pain occurs during and after eating, and may slowly disappear before being evoked again at the next meal, or relieved immediately by using a tooth pick or dental floss in the involved area. A gingival or periodontal abscess may develop from this situation.|$|E
5|$|The {{intrinsic}} hydrophobicity of {{a surface}} {{can be enhanced}} by being textured with different length scales of roughness. The red rose takes advantage of this by using a hierarchy of micro- and nanostructures on each petal to provide sufficient roughness for superhydrophobicity. More specifically, each rose petal has a collection of micropapillae {{on the surface and}} each <b>papilla,</b> in turn, has many nanofolds. The term “petal effect” describes the fact that a water droplet on the surface of a rose petal is spherical in shape, but cannot roll off even if the petal is turned upside down. The water drops maintain their spherical shape due to the superhydrophobicity of the petal (contact angle of about 152.4°), but do not roll off because the petal surface has a high adhesive force with water.|$|E
5|$|Tadpoles {{retain the}} lateral line system of their ancestral fishes, {{but this is}} lost in {{terrestrial}} adult amphibians. Some caecilians possess electroreceptors {{that allow them to}} locate objects around them when submerged in water. The ears are well developed in frogs. There is no external ear, but the large circular eardrum lies {{on the surface of the}} head just behind the eye. This vibrates and sound is transmitted through a single bone, the stapes, to the inner ear. Only high-frequency sounds like mating calls are heard in this way, but low-frequency noises can be detected through another mechanism. There is a patch of specialized haircells, called <b>papilla</b> amphibiorum, in the inner ear capable of detecting deeper sounds. Another feature, unique to frogs and salamanders, is the columella-operculum complex adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the transmission of both airborne and seismic signals. The ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound.|$|E
5000|$|Filiform <b>papillae</b> are {{the most}} {{numerous}} of the lingual <b>papillae.</b> [...] They are fine, small, cone-shaped <b>papillae</b> covering most of the dorsum of the tongue.

Unlike the other kinds of <b>papillae,</b> filiform <b>papillae</b> do not contain taste buds. They cover most of the front two-thirds of the tongue's surface.|$|R
50|$|The {{gustatory}} system {{consists of}} taste receptor cells in taste buds.

Beyond the <b>papillae,</b> taste receptors {{are also in the}} palate and early parts of the digestive system like the larynx and upper esophagus. There are three cranial nerves that innervate the tongue; the vagus nerve, glossopharyngeal nerve, and the facial nerve. The glossopharyngeal nerve and the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve innervate the TAS1R and TAS2R taste receptors.|$|R

5|$|The {{species was}} {{described}} as new to science by American mycologists Rolf Singer and Alexander H. Smith, based on specimens collected in Nor Yungas Province, Bolivia, {{on the road to}} La Paz to Coroico. They published a short description in Latin in a 1958 Mycologia publication, followed by a more detailed description in English later that year. According to Psilocybe specialist Gastón Guzmán, the species Psilocybe acutissima (described by Roger Heim in 1958), and Psilocybe isauri (described by Singer in 1959) are synonyms, as both the macroscopic and microscopic features are the same in the type material of all three. Singer considered P.isauri a species distinct from P.yungensis because of differences in the hairiness of the stem surface. Smith named the variety P.yungensis var. diconica for specimens he found with conical, rather than obconical (the form of an inverted cone) <b>papilla.</b> Similarly, the main distinguishing feature that Heim ascribed to P.acutissima was a papillate cap (somewhat resembling the shape of a female human breast). Later studies showed that these morphological variations did not warrant individual recognition, because of the variable nature of these characteristics, and the existence of intermediate forms.|$|E
25|$|The dental <b>papilla</b> {{contains}} {{cells that}} develop into odontoblasts, which are dentin-forming cells.

25|$|The {{first signs}} of an {{arrangement}} of cells in the tooth bud occur in the cap stage. A small group of ectomesenchymal cells stops producing extracellular substances, which results in an aggregation of these cells called the dental <b>papilla.</b> At this point, the tooth bud grows around the ectomesenchymal aggregation, taking on {{the appearance of a}} cap, and becomes the enamel (or dental) organ covering the dental <b>papilla.</b> A condensation of ectomesenchymal cells called the dental sac or follicle surrounds the enamel organ and limits the dental <b>papilla.</b> Eventually, the enamel organ will produce enamel, the dental <b>papilla</b> will produce dentin and pulp, and the dental sac will produce all the supporting structures of a tooth, the periodontium.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrangement}} of the inner ear in living amphibians is, in most respects, {{similar to that of}} reptiles.
