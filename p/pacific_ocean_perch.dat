50|$|<b>Pacific</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> {{are mostly}} planktivorous (Carlson and Haight 1976, Yang 1993, 1996, Yang and Nelson 2000, Yang 2003). In {{a sample of}} 600 {{juvenile}} perch stomachs, Carlson and Haight (1976) found that juveniles fed on an equal mix of calanoid copepods and euphausiids. Larger juveniles and adults fed primarily on euphausiids, {{and to a lesser}} degree, copepods, amphipods and mysids (Yang and Nelson 2000). In the Aleutian Islands, myctophids have increasingly comprised {{a substantial portion of the}} <b>Pacific</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> diet, which also compete for euphausiid prey (Yang 2003). It has been suggested that <b>Pacific</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> and walleye pollock compete for the same euphausiid prey. Consequently, the large removals of <b>Pacific</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> by foreign fishermen in the Gulf of Alaska in the 1960s may have allowed walleye pollock stocks to greatly expand in abundance.|$|E

40|$|To {{explore the}} {{transport}} of carbon into water masses from the surface ocean to depths of ∼ 1000 m∼ 1000 m in the southwest <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean,</b> we generated time series of radiocarbon (View the MathML sourceΔC 14) from fish otoliths. Otoliths (carbonate earstones) from long-lived fish provide an indirect method to examine the “bomb pulse” of radiocarbon that originated in the 1950 s and 1960 s, allowing identification of changes to distributions of 14 C that has entered and mixed within the ocean. We micro-sampled <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> (Helicolenus barathri) otoliths, collected at ∼ 400 – 500 m∼ 400 – 500 m in the Tasman Sea, to obtain measurements of View the MathML sourceΔC 14 for those depths.

The otolith bomb 14 C results from these different depths were consistent with previous water mass results in the upper 1500 m of the southwest <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean</b> (e. g.

50|$|The fishery for <b>Pacific</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> {{developed}} nearly synchronously {{from the}} U.S. West Coast to the Bering Sea. The Gulf of Alaska fishing history captures a typical catch history: A <b>Pacific</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> trawl fishery by the U.S.S.R. and Japan {{began in the}} Gulf of Alaska in the early 1960s. This fishery developed rapidly, with massive efforts by the Soviet and Japanese fleets. Catches peaked in 1965, when a total of nearly 350,000 metric tons (t) was caught. This apparent overfishing resulted in a precipitous decline in catches in the late 1960s. Catches continued to decline in the 1970s, and by 1978 catches were only 8,000 t. Foreign fishing dominated the fishery from 1977 to 1984, and catches generally declined during this period. Most of the catch was taken by Japan (Carlson et al. 1986). Catches reached a minimum in 1985, after foreign trawling in the Gulf of Alaska was prohibited.|$|E

50|$|There is much {{uncertainty}} about the life history of <b>Pacific</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>perch,</b> although generally more is known than for other rockfish species (Kendall and Lenarz 1986). The species appears to be viviparous (the eggs develop internally and receive at least some nourishment from the mother), with internal fertilization {{and the release of}} live young. Insemination occurs in the fall, and sperm are retained within the female until fertilization takes place ~2 months later. The eggs hatch internally, and parturition (release of larvae) occurs in April-May.|$|E
50|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{strategy of}} spreading reproductive output {{over many years}} {{is a way of}} ensuring some reproductive success through long periods of poor larval survival (Leaman and Beamish 1984). Fishing generally selectively removes the older and faster-growing portion of the population. If there is a distinct evolutionary advantage of retaining the oldest fish in the population, either because of higher fecundity or because of different spawning times, age-truncation could be ruinous to a population with highly episodic recruitment like rockfish (Longhurst 2002). Recent work on black rockfish (Sebastes melanops) has shown that larval survival may be dramatically higher from older female spawners (Berkeley et al. 2004, Bobko and Berkeley 2004). The black rockfish population has shown a distinct downward trend in age-structure in recent fishery samples off the West Coast of North America, raising concerns about whether these are general results for most rockfish. De Bruin et al. (2004) examined <b>Pacific</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> (S. alutus) and rougheye rockfish (S. aleutianus) for senescence in reproductive activity of older fish and found that oogenesis continues at advanced ages. Leaman (1991) showed that older individuals have slightly higher egg dry weight than their middle-aged counterparts. Such relationships have not yet been determined to exist for <b>Pacific</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> or other rockfish in Alaska.|$|E
50|$|Information {{on early}} life history is very sparse, {{especially}} {{for the first year}} of life. <b>Pacific</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> larvae are thought to be pelagic and drift with the current, and oceanic conditions may sometimes cause advection to suboptimal areas (Ainley et al. 1993) resulting in high recruitment variability. However, larval studies of rockfish have been hindered by difficulties in species identification since many larval rockfish species share the same morphological characteristics (Kendall 2000). Genetic techniques using allozymes (Seeb and Kendall 1991) and mitochondrial DNA (Li 2004) are capable of identifying larvae and juveniles to species, but are expensive and time-consuming.|$|E

50|$|Post-larval {{and early}} young-of-the-year <b>Pacific</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> have been {{positively}} identified in offshore, surface {{waters of the}} GOA (Gharrett et al. 2002), which suggests {{this may be the}} preferred habitat of this life stage. Transformation to a demersal existence may take place within the first year (Carlson and Haight 1976). Small juveniles probably reside inshore in very rocky, high relief areas, and by age 3 begin to migrate to deeper offshore waters of the continental shelf (Carlson and Straty 1981). As they grow, they continue to migrate deeper, eventually reaching the continental slope, where they attain adulthood.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pacific</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> is a {{very slow}} growing species, with a low rate of natural {{mortality}} (estimated at 0.06), a relatively old age at 50% maturity (10.5 years for females in the Gulf of Alaska), and a very old maximum age of 98 years in Alaska (84 years maximum age in the Gulf of Alaska) (Hanselman et al. 2003). Age at 50% recruitment to the commercial fishery has been estimated to be between 7 and 8 years in the Gulf of Alaska. Despite their viviparous nature, the fish is relatively fecund with number of eggs/female in Alaska ranging from 10,000-300,000, depending upon size of the fish (Leaman 1991).|$|E
