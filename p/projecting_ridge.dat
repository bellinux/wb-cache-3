60|$|Even {{now in its}} fallen state no city is so {{impressive}} {{at first}} sight as Jerusalem; the walls, magnificent in height and strength, and picturesque in their deep embattlements, rising {{on the edge of}} a deep valley. Every building has its name and history. Here is the church built by the first Crusaders; there the mighty mosque of Suleiman on the site of the Temple; far away on a <b>projecting</b> <b>ridge</b> the great building known as the Tomb of Moses; on the right beyond the houses rise the towers on the Roman walls; the Pool of Bethsaida lies in the hollow; in the center are the cupolas of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Among all the fairest cities of the world, there are none which can compare in stately beauty with Jerusalem. Doubtless it was a fairer city in those days, for long centuries of Turkish possession have reduced many of the former stately palaces to ruins. Then, as now, the banner of the Prophet floated over the high places; but whereas at present the population is poor and squalid, the city in those days contained a far larger number of inhabitants, irrespective of the great garrison collected for its defense.|$|E

50|$|As {{its name}} implies, the {{pharyngeal}} region is occupied mainly by the pharynx. The large buccal siphon opens into the pharynx, {{acting like a}} mouth. The pharynx itself is ciliated and contains numerous perforations, or stigmata, arranged in a grid-like pattern around its circumference. The beating of the cilia sucks water through the siphon, and then through the stigmata. A long ciliated groove, or endostyle, runs along {{one side of the}} pharynx, and a <b>projecting</b> <b>ridge</b> along the other. The endostyle may be homologous with the thyroid gland of vertebrates, despite its differing function.|$|E
5000|$|Head Peak (...) is a peak 3.5 nmi km east of Le Couteur Peak, {{situated}} on a <b>projecting</b> <b>ridge</b> of Millen Range in the névé area of Pearl Harbor Glacier, Victoria Land, Antarctica.

50|$|This fish has ribbon-like body {{measuring}} up to 150 cm (59 in) in length. Its {{common name}} comes from a horn-like supraoccipital process projecting forward of its eyes.

The dorsal fin runs along {{the entire length of}} the body and contains 310-392 soft rays; the first three to five dorsal rays at the tip of the <b>projecting</b> <b>ridge</b> are elongated into a pennant. The pectoral fins contain 13-15 rays; the pelvic fins are absent. The anal fin contains five to 9 rays and in adults is split lengthwise to form two rows of nubbins. The caudal fin contains 12-13 rays, with the bottommost ray enlarged and bony. The coloration is silvery with 24-60 dark subvertical bands. The dorsal and caudal fins are crimson.|$|E

50|$|Zby {{was first}} {{described}} and named by Octávio Mateus, Philip D. Mannion and Paul Upchurch in 2014 {{and the type}} species is Zby atlanticus. It is known solely from its holotype, a closely associated partial skeleton including a complete tooth with root, a fragment of cervical neural arch, an anterior chevron, and an almost complete right pectoral girdle and forelimb. Zby is differentiated from other sauropods based on four autapomorphies, including a prominent posteriorly <b>projecting</b> <b>ridge</b> on the humerus {{at the level of}} the deltopectoral crest. Zby is suggested to be closely related to Turiasaurus riodevensis from approximately contemporaneous deposits in eastern Spain, based on its tooth morphology, extreme anteroposterior compression of the proximal end of the radius, and strong beveling of the lateral half of the distal end of the radius, while some other forelimb traits distinguish these two genera. Nearly all other anatomical features suggest that Zby is a non-neosauropod eusauropod, confirming its position as a Turiasaurian.|$|E
40|$|The {{digestive}} system of {{several species of}} sea spiders (Pycnogonida, Arthropoda) was studied by electron microscopy. It is composed of the foregut inside a long proboscis, a midgut and a hindgut. Lips near the three jaws {{at the tip of}} the proboscis receive several hundred ductules originating from salivary glands. These previously undetected glands open on the lips, a fluted, <b>projecting</b> <b>ridge</b> at the external hinge line of the jaws, i. e., to the outside of the mouth. This disposition suggests affinities to the chelicerate line. The trigonal esophagus within the proboscis contains a complex, setose filter device, operated by dedicated muscles, that serves to reduce ingested food to subcellular dimensions. The midgut has diverticula into the bases of all legs. Its cells differentiate from the basal layer and contain a bewildering array of secretion droplets, lysosomes and phagosomes. In the absence of a hepatopancreas, the midgut serves both digestive and absorptive functions. The cuticle-lined hindgut lies in the highly reduced, peg-like abdomen. Traditionally, pycnogonids have been claimed to have no excretory organ at all. Such a structure, however, has been located in at least one ammotheid, Nymphopsis spinosissima, in which a simple, but standard, excretory gland has been found in the scape of the chelifore. It consists of an end sac, a straight proximal tubule, a short distal tubule, and a raised nephropore. The end sac is a thin-walled and polygonal chamber, about 150 μm in cross section, suspended in the hemocoel of the appendage, its edges radially tethered to the cuticle at more than half a dozen locations. This wall consists of a filtration basement membrane, 1 – 4 μm thick, facing the hemocoel, and internally of a continuous carpet of podocytes and their pedicels. The podocytes, measuring maximally 10 by 15 μm, have complex contents, of which a labyrinthine system of connected intracellular channels stands out. These coated cisternae open into a central vacuole that often rivals the nucleus in size. The design of the organ closely approximates that of the primitive crustacean Hutchinsoniella macracantha. J.

5000|$|A {{quarter of}} a mile up the hill from Birstall on Leeds Road, there was once a Roman watch tower. This {{observation}} point was built on the ridge or [...] "brae" [...] of the hill. One side overlooked the Birstall area, while the other looked downwards from Howden Clough and the valley towards upland Morley. This watchtower was known in the early 20th century to the local inhabitants as the Brass Castle, a corruption of Brae Castle. It followed the line of other such structures built in West Yorkshire, atop prominent <b>projecting</b> <b>ridges.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} diamond vaults {{involved}} {{an understanding of}} how the whole interior is shaped through a correlation of its geometry, spatial composition and support system. The vaults have the ability visually to integrate or to compartmentalise interiors, to make them appear to expand through seamless recession or to diminish them by the presence of claustrophobic, heavily <b>projecting</b> <b>ridges.</b> They can add an element of playful irregularity to symmetrical spaces, or conversely can harmonise oddly shaped interiors. Their plasticity is enhanced by the contrasting play of light and dark across their surfaces.|$|R

The mobile finger of the chela has 24 teeth on its inner surface while the fixed finger has 33. The original coloration of the species is not identifiable due to the orange color-yellowish of the amber that encloses the specimens. The oval abdomen is longer than it is wide and has a generally teardrop shape.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the Red HookIBay <b>Ridge</b> <b>project</b> was to evaluate proposed dredged material from these two areas to determine its suitability for unconfined ocean disposal at the Mud Dump Site. Sediment samples were collected from the Red Hook/Bay <b>Ridge</b> <b>project</b> areas. Tests and analyses were conducted. The evaluation of proposed dredged material from the Red Hook/Bay <b>Ridge</b> <b>project</b> areas consisted of bulk sediment chemical analyses, chemical analyses of dredging site water and elutriate, water-column and benthic acute toxicity tests. Twenty-four individual sediment core samples were collected from these two areas and analyzed for grain size, moisture content, and total organic carbon (TOC). Three composite sediment samples, representing Red Hook Channel and the two Bay Ridge Reaches to be dredged, were analyzed for bulk density, specific gravity, metals, chlorinated pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and 1, 4 -dichlorobenzene. Dredging site water and elutriate water, which is prepared from the suspended-particulate phase (SPP) of the three Red Hook Bay Ridge sediment composites, were analyzed for metals, pesticides, and PCBS. Benthic acute toxicity tests were performed. Water-column or SPP toxicity tests were performed. Bioaccumulation tests were also conducted...|$|R
