5|$|The game {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} upon release. Critics praised the game's colourful visuals, boss battles and special effects, but most cited its <b>poor</b> <b>control</b> schemes, aesthetics and general gameplay as major flaws. Despite the mixed reception, Iizuka commented {{that he would}} be interested in making a third Nights game, should Sega commission one.|$|E
5|$|The game {{made use}} of cutting edge {{technology}} such as force–feedback joysticks and controllers, 3D sound and Direct3D Hardware Acceleration and was largely well received. Critics noted that the game's graphics {{were some of the}} most technically impressive of the time. Overall, however, critics had mixed response for the graphics, as the demanding graphics resulted in poor draw distance; in particular, the PlayStation version struggled in this aspect. In general, the gameplay was favourably reviewed, with critics praising the solid, enjoyable missions, though there were complaints regarding a <b>poor</b> <b>control</b> system and unfairly high levels of difficulty.|$|E
5|$|The {{multiplayer}} component was criticized, with Polygon {{calling it}} one of the least necessary multiplayer additions to a typically single-player experience. The gameplay was described as a mediocre shooter, incapable of supporting the necessary use of guns by its villains and with <b>poor</b> <b>control</b> of movement. GameSpot noted that poor weapon accuracy and movement controls made the thugs seem weak and inept, while playing as the heroes lacked empowerment because of more restrictive combat ability and less resistance to damage. Other reviewers called the experience fun and hectic, but lacking sufficient depth to retain long-term interest.|$|E

OXM's Dyer commented that the game had [...] "crummy controls" [...] and a poor camera. Reviewer Austin Light of GameSpot also cited <b>poor</b> <b>controls,</b> physics, and gameplay glitches. Eurogamers Dan Whitehead felt the controls were weak {{in comparison to the}} original Vigilante 8. He further felt the game did not meet up to its potential. 1UP.coms Hayward further agreed with Whitehead, stating [...] "sadly ... most of Vigilante 8: Arcade's issues are technical in nature." ...|$|R
5000|$|Justice League Task Force {{received}} mostly negative reviews. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly {{scored the}} Genesis version a 5.875 out of 10, criticizing the choppy animation, {{limited number of}} moves, and most especially the <b>poor</b> <b>controls,</b> which they said made executing special moves [...] "too much work to be any fun." [...] GamePro gave negative reviews to both the Genesis and SNES versions, similarly citing <b>poor</b> <b>controls,</b> unimpressive special moves, and sprites which look good in still frame but ugly in animation.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{their failure}} to score any hits, the American torpedo attacks {{achieved}} three important results. First, they kept the Japanese carriers off balance and unable to prepare and launch their own counterstrike. Second, the <b>poor</b> <b>control</b> of the Japanese combat air patrol (CAP) meant {{they were out of}} position for subsequent attacks. Third, many of the Zeros ran low on ammunition and fuel. The appearance of a third torpedo plane attack from the southeast by VT-3 from Yorktown at 10:00 very quickly drew the majority of the Japanese CAP to the southeast quadrant of the fleet. Better discipline, and the employment of a greater number of Zeroes for the CAP might have enabled Nagumo to prevent (or at least mitigate) the damage caused by the coming American attacks.|$|E
5|$|Dysphagia and dysarthria: {{dysphagia}} is {{a difficulty}} with eating and swallowing which may cause choking and aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs, while dysarthria is a neurological motor speech disorder characterized by <b>poor</b> <b>control</b> over the subsystems and muscles responsible for speech ("articulation"). A {{speech and language therapist}} may give advice on specific swallowing techniques, on adapting food consistencies and dietary intake, on techniques {{to improve and}} maintain speech production and clarity, and on alternative communication approaches. In the case of advanced dysphagia, food can be supplied by a nasogastric tube, which is a tube that goes through the nose directly to the stomach; or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), which is a procedure for placing a tube into the stomach and therefore administering food directly to it. This second system, although more invasive, has better results in the long term than nasogastric intake.|$|E

40|$|Fifteen {{patients}} began {{insulin treatment}} in a diabetic day-care unit and 14 patients began insulin treatment in hospital. The cost per patient of initiating insulin treatment in hospital was nine times {{the cost in}} a day-care program. In general, the disease of patients with juvenile-onset diabetes was initially under <b>poorer</b> <b>control</b> in those admitted to hospital than in those in the day-care program. However, the day-care juvenile with disease under <b>poorest</b> <b>control</b> was comparable to the most severely affected patient admitted to hospital.

25|$|Glycosylated {{hemoglobin}} is {{the form}} of hemoglobin to which glucose is bound. The binding of glucose to amino acids in the hemoglobin takes place spontaneously (without {{the help of an}} enzyme) in many proteins, and is not known to serve a useful purpose. However, the binding to hemoglobin does serve as a record for average blood glucose levels over the lifetime of red cells, which is approximately 120 days. The levels of glycosylated hemoglobin are therefore measured in order to monitor the long-term control of the chronic disease of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). <b>Poor</b> <b>control</b> of T2DM results in high levels of glycosylated hemoglobin in the red blood cells. The normal reference range is approximately 4–5.9%. Though difficult to obtain, values less than 7% are recommended for people with T2DM. Levels greater than 9% are associated with <b>poor</b> <b>control</b> of the glycosylated hemoglobin, and levels greater than 12% are associated with very <b>poor</b> <b>control.</b> Diabetics who keep their glycosylated hemoglobin levels close to 7% have a much better chance of avoiding the complications that may accompany diabetes (than those whose levels are 8% or higher). In addition, increased glycosylation of hemoglobin increases its affinity for oxygen, therefore preventing its release at the tissue and inducing a level of hypoxia in extreme cases.|$|E
25|$|Hershiser was {{selected}} by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 17th round of the 1979 Major League Baseball draft. The original scouting report on him for the draft {{said that he had}} <b>poor</b> <b>control,</b> a weak fastball and threw the curveball incorrectly. It went on to state that he rattled easily and had questionable makeup.|$|E
5000|$|Although never released, Socks the Cat Rocks the Hill was {{reviewed}} by multiple publications who generally {{saw it as}} an average platformer albeit with excellent boss design and political satire. Nintendo Power found the boss characters to be humorous but criticized the <b>poor</b> <b>controls.</b> [...] GamePro also praised the bosses and the satire, but were more critical with the flat graphics and poor sound. Nintendo Power believed <b>poor</b> <b>controls</b> made the game challenging, but GamePro found the game easy and thought the controls [...] "take practice but prove effective." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthly dubbed it [...] "a cute run-and-jump, claw the enemies game." ...|$|R

25|$|While {{prior to}} his major league career Winters was being {{compared}} to Christy Mathewson, by April 12, 1920, the Milwaukee Sentinel was comparing him to Ferdie Schupp. The newspaper noted Winters' lack of control on the mound and related him to Schupp, who, like Winters, was a very highly touted prospect that initially showed <b>poor</b> <b>control.</b> As Winters did not appear in many games in his rookie season, Schupp too spent {{the early part of}} his career primarily in the dugout. However, by 1917, he blossomed by winning 21 games for the Giants. The newspaper predicted a similar output by Winters.|$|E
25|$|The {{elderly and}} those with a {{weakened}} immune system are especially vulnerable to contracting cellulitis. Diabetics {{are more susceptible to}} cellulitis than the general population because of impairment of the immune system; they are especially prone to cellulitis in the feet, because the disease causes impairment of blood circulation in the legs, leading to diabetic foot or foot ulcers. <b>Poor</b> <b>control</b> of blood glucose levels allows bacteria to grow more rapidly in the affected tissue, and facilitates rapid progression if the infection enters the bloodstream. Neural degeneration in diabetes means these ulcers may not be painful, thus often become infected. Those who have suffered poliomyelitis are also prone because of circulatory problems, especially in the legs.|$|E
25|$|The piling, wetting, {{and mixing}} of the piled máochá ensures even fermentation. The {{bacterial}} and fungal cultures {{found in the}} fermenting piles were found to vary widely from factory to factory throughout Yunnan, consisting of multiple strains of Aspergillus spp., Penicillium spp., yeasts, and {{a wide range of}} other microflora. Control over the multiple variables in the ripening process, particularly humidity and the growth of Aspergillus spp., is key in producing ripened pu'er of high quality. <b>Poor</b> <b>control</b> in fermentation/oxidation process can result in bad ripened pu'er, characterized by badly decomposed leaves and an aroma and texture reminiscent of compost. The ripening process typically takes between 45 and 60 days on average.|$|E
2500|$|The Simpsons Skateboarding {{received}} [...] "unfavorable" [...] reviews {{according to}} the review aggregation website Metacritic.

40|$|The common {{practice}} of collapsing inherently continuous or ordinal variables {{into two categories}} causes information loss that may potentially weaken power to detect effects of explanatory variables and result in Type II errors in statistical inference. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to illustrate, using a substantive example, the potential increase in power gained from an ordinal in-stead of a dichotomous specification for an inherently continuous response. Ordinary (OLR) and cumulative logistic regression (CLR) modeling were used to test the hypothesis that the risk of alveolar bone loss over 2 years is greater for subjects with <b>poorer</b> <b>control</b> of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) than {{for those who do not}} have diabetes or have better controlled NIDDM. There were 359 subjects; 21 of whom had NIDDM. Analysis of main effects using OLR for the dichotomous outcome (no change in radiographic bone loss vs any change) produced parameter estimates for better <b>control</b> and <b>poorer</b> <b>control</b> that were not statistically significant. CLR analysis of main effects using a 4 -category ordinal specification for radiographic bone loss also produced a parameter estimate for better control that was not statistically significant, but which estimated <b>poorer</b> <b>control</b> to have a significant effect. Thet of this CLR model was significantly better at P < 0. 05 than that for the OLR. While an OLR model testing the interaction between age and control status did not converge after 100 iterations, the CLR interaction model converged without difficulty and estimated a significant effect for interaction between age and <b>poorer</b> <b>control.</b> Results from the CLR analysis, in contrast to the OLR model, would lead one to conclude that the risk for more severe bone loss progression after 2 years is greater in subjects with <b>poorer</b> <b>controlled</b> NIDDM and that subjects with better controlled NIDDM may not have greater risk of bone loss progression than those without diabetes. The use of an ordinal instead of a dichotomous specification for an inherently continuous response provided increased power, more precise parameter estimates, and a significantly better fitting model. In estimating parameter estimates for odds ratios or risks, it is important to consider using ordinal logistic regression where the response is inherently continuous or ordinal...|$|R
25|$|However, the {{offensive}} was not authorised {{and it was}} cancelled six hours after it had been launched. An investigation was launched by the HV, and two senior officers were relieved of their duty, before being reassigned to new positions. According to General Martin Špegelj, the decision to abort {{the offensive}} was wrong as it meant a missed opportunity to recapture Baranja which had been lost to the JNA in 1991. Admiral Davor Domazet-Lošo {{pointed out that the}} offensive presented a significant political problem to Croatian leadership as it meant that the political leaders of Croatia had <b>poor</b> <b>control</b> over its military, or that Croatia was violating its international obligations towards the United Nations (UN) in respect of the Vance plan at the time the country sought to {{become a member of the}} UN.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{another common}} problem that fits into this {{category}} is flutter. At some speeds, the airflow over the control surfaces will become turbulent, and the controls will start to flutter. If {{the speed of the}} fluttering is close to a harmonic of the control's movement, the resonance could break the control off completely. This was a serious problem on the Zero and VL Myrsky. When problems with <b>poor</b> <b>control</b> at high speed were first encountered, they were addressed by designing a new style of control surface with more power. However, this introduced a new resonant mode, and a number of planes were lost before this was discovered. On design of VL Myrsky, this problem was countered by increasing the rigidity and weight of the wing, therefore increasing the dampening of the harmonic oscillation, which compromised the performance to some extent.|$|E
25|$|Events {{move from}} {{political}} manoeuvring to street fighting when a rebel army invades Laurania. While Savrola {{knows about the}} army and intended invasion, he has <b>poor</b> <b>control</b> over it, so the invasion has started without his knowledge or proper preparations. Both sides scramble for a fight, as Molara finds the country's regular troops refuse to obey his orders. He is obliged to despatch most of the loyal Republican Guard from the capital to oppose the invaders, leaving him with a much reduced force to hold the capital. Fierce street fighting {{takes place in the}} capital between the revolutionaries of the Popular Party and the Republican Guard. The revolution culminates in the storming of the Presidential Palace and the death on the steps of his palace of General Molara. The revolutionary allies start to break apart {{in the face of a}} threat by the Lauranian navy (which remains loyal to the president), to bombard the city unless Savrola is handed over to them. The council of public safety decides the most expedient position would be to agree to this, but Savrola escapes attempts to arrest him and flees with Lucile. The city is subsequently bombarded when Savrola is not produced, and the last scene is of Savrola watching the destruction from outside the city.|$|E

25|$|The Conservatives {{had so far}} {{failed to}} {{represent}} a serious challenge to Labour's rule, with John Major's successor William Hague unable to make any real improvement upon the disastrous 1997 general election result at the next election four years later. He stepped down after the 2001 election to be succeeded by Iain Duncan Smith, who did not even hold the leadership long enough to contest a general election – being ousted by his own MP's in October 2003 and being replaced by Michael Howard, who had served as Home Secretary {{in the government of}} John Major. Howard failed to win the 2005 general election for the Conservatives but he at least had the satisfaction of narrowing the Labour majority, giving his successor (he announced his resignation shortly after the election) a decent platform to build upon. However, the Conservatives began to re-emerge as an electable prospect following the election of David Cameron as Howard's successor in December 2005. Within months of Cameron becoming Conservative leader, opinion polls during 2006 were showing a regular Conservative lead {{for the first time since}} Black Wednesday 14 years earlier. Despite the economy still being strong and unemployment remaining low, Labour's decline in support was largely blamed upon <b>poor</b> <b>control</b> of immigration and allowing Britain to become what was seen by many as an easy target for terrorists.|$|E
500|$|The only {{supersonic}} airliner {{in direct}} competition with Concorde was the Soviet Tupolev Tu-144, nicknamed [...] "Concordski" [...] by Western European journalists for its outward similarity to Concorde. It had been alleged that Soviet espionage efforts {{had resulted in}} the theft of Concorde blueprints, supposedly {{to assist in the}} design of the Tu-144. As a result of a rushed development programme, the first Tu-144 prototype was substantially different from the preproduction machines, but both were cruder than Concorde. The Tu-144S had a significantly shorter range than Concorde. Jean Rech, Sud Aviation, attributed this to two things, a very heavy powerplant with an intake twice as long as that on Concorde, and low-bypass turbofan engines with too-high a bypass ratio which needed afterburning for cruise. The aircraft had <b>poor</b> <b>control</b> at low speeds because of a simpler supersonic wing design; in addition the Tu-144 required braking parachutes to land while Concorde used anti-lock brakes. The Tu-144 had two crashes, one at the 1973 Paris Air Show, and another during a pre-delivery test flight in May 1978.|$|E
500|$|Two {{spots in}} the {{starting}} rotation were available {{by the time the}} Pirates started their 1960 season. At the beginning of spring training, Umbricht competed against fellow rookies Bennie Daniels and Joe Gibbon for a place. The Pirates began strongly in spring training, winning 11 in a row at one point. In a game against the Detroit Tigers, Umbricht combined with Daniels to throw a no-hitter. Manager Danny Murtaugh was impressed with Umbricht's pitching and expected him to become the Pirates' fifth starter (a combination of spot starter and reliever) by opening day. He won the spot and in his first start of the season against the Reds on April 17, he gave up six earned runs in 5.1 innings, getting charged with the 11–3 loss. In his next start against the Philadelphia Phillies on April 21, Umbricht had <b>poor</b> <b>control,</b> giving up three runs and walking five batters in 2.1 innings. [...] He made a last-minute start against Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale on May 25, after Pirates starting pitcher Bob Friend had a sore throat and could not play. Umbricht pitched five innings, striking out five batters, but gave up two critical second-inning home runs to Frank Howard and John Roseboro and was charged with the loss. After an off-day and a game postponed because of rain, the Pirates faced the Phillies at home on May 28. [...] After the game went to extra innings, Umbricht pitched the thirteenth inning. The Pirates won in the later half of the inning, earning Umbricht his first career win.|$|E
