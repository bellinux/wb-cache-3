Sensors can monitor these parame-ters and enhance logistic decision-making based on the actual quality level of goods. In our simulation study we show that a sensor based approach is superior to established practices even when considering the abilities of individuals to judge the goods ’ quality by visual and tactile inspections. With sensor information, retailers can achieve higher profits, increased resource efficiency, higher quality, and a reduced amount of <b>perished</b> <b>goods</b> on the sales floor...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{details the}} {{application}} of a class of heuristics to the Fixed-life Perishability Problem formulated by Nahmias (1975 a) and Fries (1975). Various assumptions for this model include i. i. d. demand, linear ordering, holding and penalty costs. Goods have a known fixed lifetime and <b>perished</b> <b>goods</b> cause a linear outdating cost to be incurred. The approach we use, that of developing heuristics from 'near myopic' bounds, involves viewing periodic inventory problems in the framework of the classic "newsboy" model. We exploit various properties of the problem under consideration to derive tight bounds on the newsboy parameters, thus leading to efficient bounds on the order quantities. Computational studies reveal that the heuristic policies are near optimal, and are easy to compute. inventory control, infinite horizon dynamic programs, perishable inventory...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of sustainable development, industries have witnessed significant sustainability challenges. Literature shows that the food industry is concerned about its need for efficient and effective management practices in dealing with perishability and the requirements for conditioned storage and transport of food products that effect the environment. Hence, the environmental part of sustainability demonstrates its significance in this industrial sector. Despite this, {{there has been little}} research into environmentally sustainable inventory management of deteriorating items. This thesis presents mathematical modelling based research for production inventory systems in perishable food supply chains. In this study, multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming models are developed to determine economically and environmentally optimal production and inventory decisions for a two-echelon supply chain. The supply chain consists of single sourcing suppliers for raw materials and a producer who operates under a make-to-stock or make-to-order strategy. The demand facing the producer is non-stationary stochastic in nature and has requirements in terms of service level and the remaining shelf life of the marketed products. Using data from the literature, numerical examples are given in order to test and analyse these models. The computational experiments show that operational adjustments in cases where emission and cost parameters were not strongly correlated with supply chain collaboration (where suppliers and a producer operate under centralised control), emissions are effectively reduced without a significant increase in cost. The findings show that assigning a high disposal cost, limit or high weight of importance to <b>perished</b> <b>goods</b> leads to appropriate reduction of expected waste in the supply chain with no major cost increase. The research has made contributions to the literature on sustainable production and inventory management; providing formal models that can be used as an aid to understanding and as a tool for planning and improving sustainable production and inventory control in supply chains involving deteriorating items, in particular with perishable food supply chains. the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Royal Thai Government...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{comprises}} three Parts, {{together with}} a preface and an addendum. Each of the Parts focuses upon {{one of the three}} inter-related concepts applicable where there is a post-contract <b>perishing</b> of <b>goods.</b> The concepts of "perishing", "risk" and "frustration" are separately analysed so as to identify their individual characteristics and in order that facets of their inter-relationship may emerge. Part One, which deals with the meaning of "perishing", is more descriptive in nature than the other two Parts, for, when considered in isolation, the issues raised in that Part are relatively straightforward. It is only when those same issues are re-considered, {{in the context of the}} concepts of risk and frustration, that their significance becomes apparent. In Part Two, an analysis is made of the meaning of "risk" and instances of the divisibility of risk are examined. Different views of the mishaps provided for by the statutory term "risk" are assessed and, as part of that exercise, the meaning of "perished" is re-appraised. An analysis is made, in Part Three, of the rules which provide for frustration of a contract of sale and for the consequences resulting from such frustration. An attempt is made to identify instances in which a contract of sale may be frustrated even though property, or risk, or, indeed, both property and risk, have passed to the buyer prior to the <b>goods</b> <b>perishing.</b> In the addendum to the thesis an opportunity is taken to re-examine the concepts of "perishing", "risk" and "frustration" in a context in which, the separate concepts having already been analysed and detailed statutory and common law provisions scrutinised, there is freedom to bring together strands which have emerged from the various Parts of the thesis.

40|$|Abstract: The {{original}} {{studies of}} supply and demand markets established their strong efficiency and equilibrium convergence behavior using economically unsophisticated and untrained subjects. The results were unexpected because all individual costs and values were private and dependent entirely on the market trading process to aggregate the dispersed information into socially desirable outcomes. The exchange environment, however, corresponded to that of perishable, and not re-traded goods in which traders were specialized as buyers or sellers. We report new experiments in repeated single period markets where durability, and buyer-seller specialization, is varied by imposing or relaxing a restriction on re-trade within each period. In re-trade markets scope is given to speculative motives unavailable where <b>goods</b> <b>perish</b> on purchase. We observe greatly increased trade volume and decreased efficiency but experience increases efficiency. Observed speculation slows convergence by impeding the process whereby individuals learn from the market whether their private circumstances fit them to specialize as buyers or sellers.

6000|$|... § 4. It would {{nevertheless}} {{be a great}} error {{to assign}} only a trifling importance to the agency of eminent individuals, or of governments. It must not be concluded that the influence of either is small, {{because they can not}} bestow what the general circumstances of society, and the course of its previous history, have not prepared it to receive. Neither thinkers nor governments effect all that they intend, but in compensation they often produce important results which they did not in the least foresee. Great men, and great actions, are seldom wasted; they send forth a thousand unseen influences, more effective than those which are seen; and though nine out of every ten things done, with a good purpose, by those who are in advance of their age, produce no material effect, the tenth thing produces effects twenty times as great as any one would have dreamed of predicting from it. Even the men who for want of sufficiently favorable circumstances left no impress at all upon their own age, have often been of the greatest value to posterity. Who could appear to have lived more entirely in vain than some of the early heretics? They were burned or massacred, their writings extirpated, their memory anathematized, and their very names and existence left for seven or eight centuries in the obscurity of musty manuscripts—their history to be gathered, perhaps, only from the sentences by which they were condemned. Yet the memory of these men—men who resisted certain pretensions or certain dogmas of the Church in the very age in which the unanimous assent of Christendom was afterward claimed as having been given to them, and asserted as the ground of their authority—broke the chain of tradition, established a series of precedents for resistance, inspired later Reformers with the courage, and armed them with the weapons, which they needed when mankind were better prepared to follow their impulse. To this example from men, let us add another from governments. The comparatively enlightened rule of which Spain had the benefit during a considerable part of the eighteenth century, did not correct the fundamental defects of the Spanish people; and in consequence, though it did great temporary good, so much of that <b>good</b> <b>perished</b> with it, that it may plausibly be affirmed to have had no permanent effect. The case has been cited as a proof how little governments can do in opposition to the causes which have determined the general character of the nation. It does show how much there is which they can not do; but not that they can do nothing. Compare what Spain was at the beginning of that half-century of liberal government, with what she had become at its close. That period fairly let in the light of European thought upon the more educated classes; and it never afterward ceased to go on spreading. Previous to that time the change was in an inverse direction; culture, light, intellectual and even material activity, were becoming extinguished. Was it nothing to arrest this downward and convert it into an upward course? How much that Charles the Third and Aranda could not do, has been the ultimate consequence of what they did! To that half-century Spain owes that she has got rid of the Inquisition, that she has got rid of the monks, that she now has parliaments and (save in exceptional intervals) a free press, and the feelings of freedom and citizenship, and is acquiring railroads and all the other constituents of material and economical progress. In the Spain which preceded that era, {{there was not a single}} element at work which could have led to these results in any length of time, if the country had continued to be governed as it was by the last princes of the Austrian dynasty, or if the Bourbon rulers had been from the first what, both in Spain and in Naples, they afterward became.|$|R
40|$|Few {{predictions}} {{can have}} been less accurate than the claim by the anonymous author of London's Glory (1661) that the Fifth Monarchists would prove a 'never to be forgotten sect'. After brief literary glory as the subjects of Abraham Cowley's play Cutter of Coleman Street (1663), they languished in obscurity until revivified by Sir Walter Scott in 1822 in hia novel Peveril of the Peak. Since they have no modern descendants, the Fifth Monarchists have not received the close study by denominational historians which the Quakers, for example, have enjoyed. The Fifth Monarchists' call for violent revolution has led baptist and Congregationaiist historians to miniinize or ignore the close associations which these denominations had with the movement. The Fifth Monarchists showed few of the egalitarian tendencies of the Levellers and Diggers which have attracted so many modern Historians. In the present century the Fifth Monarchists have been the subjects of only two brief monographs. In 1911 Miss Louise Brown published her work, The Political Activities of the Baptists and Fifth Monarchy Men in England during the Interregnum, a careful and accurate survey of this aspect which, however, left untouched the broader issues {{of the nature of}} the movement, and the causes of its rise and decline. P. G. Rogers attempted a broader examination in the Fifth Monarchy Men (1966), but the brevity of this work and the inadequate research on which it was based made the results far from satisfactory. Four main aspects of the Fifth Monarchist movement have been studied, and these are indicated in the title of the thesis. These are, firstly, the circumstances which explain the origins and spread of millenarian ideas in general during this period, and of Fifth Monarchist doctrines in particular, and, secondly, the social composition of the movement. Thirdly, an attempt has been made to establish what political, social, economic and religious structures were envisaged by the Fifth Monarchists, and to explain why specific proposals were made. Lastly, an examination has been made of the later history of the movement, and the subsequent careers of its members. Chapters 1 - 3 sketch briefly the intellectual climate of the period, and then set the Fifth Monarchists in the context of the general European politico-religious situation following the Reformation. The unprecedented division of Western Europe was seen by many early Protestants as a cataclysmic event, explicable only in terras of the fulfilment of the prophecies of the end of the world. Subsequent political developments, such as the french and Dutch Wars of Religion and the Thirty Years' War, were fitted into the prophetic scheues of Daniel and Revelation. The standard interpretation of the prophecies had to be modified only slightly to guarantee the triumph of the godly (Protestants) before rather than after the end of the world. As early as the 1530 s there was an attempt at Münster to set up a New Jerusalem, though the revolutionary political and social doctrines associated with this episode served to discredit millenarianism for many years. But in the early part of the seventeenth century, when the Protestant cause was again in danger of extinction, millenarianism flourished once more. In England, the government was sufficiently strong to prevent another Münster, but a series of self-proclaimed propnets and messiahs, a number of millenarian Puritan ministers and the writings of the academics Mede and Brightman all testified to interest in millenarian ideas. There was also a popular and related concept of England as a chosen nation, entrusted with the execution of God's cosmic plans. When the civil war broke out in 1642, it was rapidly placed by Puritan preachers in a millenarian framework, and accepted in this way by many in the army and in Parliament. A study of the writings of clergy supporting Parliament in the period 1640 - 53 suggests that about 70 % of them believed that a last age of unparallelled glory was about to dawn. But millenarianism was a very flexible concept, and many who looked forward to a time of spiritual perfection abandoned a doctrine which many in the army and the sects equated with social revolution. The execution of King Charles, making way for King Jesus, intensified millenarian excitement, but the Rump did nothing to answer these hopes. The emergence of the Fifth Monarchist movement was a response to the apparent apostacy of all in authority from the millenarian cause. Fifth Monarchists claimed the right of the individual citizen, as saint, to throw down ungodly governments because they had despaired of the magistrates or any in official position doing so. They were an opposition movement, and always remained such except briefly during the Barebones Parliament of 1653. The composition of the Fifth Monarchist movement (chapter 4) reflects the importance of the New Model Army in its origin. Fifth Monarchism was a largely urban movement, and many of the towns where it flourished were garrison towns or naval establishments. Many of the saints had served in the army, as officers, soldiers, or chaplains. There are no Fifth Monarchist records comparable to the Quaker lists of births, marriages and deaths, but an analysis of the two hundred and thirty Fifth Monarchists whose occupations can be establisned gives some indication of their social composition. There was a small but important group of ministers and high-ranking army officers of relatively high social origin. Of the remainder, a large proportion, about 30 %, were engaged in the cloth and leather industry and trade. Wone of them was a large-scale merchant or producer. The movement attracted only small masters, journeymen, apprentices and labourers. Grace was more important than birth, and there was no discrimination against those who were economically unfree. Servants and labourers could play an important role, and women were also prominent. A considerable amount of biographical information has been accumulated during the course of this study, and this has been summarized in the Biographical Appendix. The careers of some, such as Feake and William Medley, have been traced for thirty years after the last date when they were previously known. The Fifth Monarchists were a very loosely-organized body, and never formulated a common programme. But their main objectives can be established, and these are discussed in chapters 6 - 8. The evidence is drawn from the numerous manifestoes, declarations, sermons and biblical expositions published in the 1650 s, and from the State Papers. The limited data from the Restoration period suggest that these objectives remained constant. The Fifth Monarchists demanded the destruction of the privileged orders, the national ministry, the lawyers, the great merchants, and the ungodly magistrates and nobility. In their place, they sought to establish a theocracy, an oligarchy of the 'visible saints', and to establish a new social structure in which godliness not birth would be the criterion of superiority. They called for a cheap and decentralized legal system using the Mosaic Code, and for the relief of the poor and of debtors. The principle of private property was accepted, but there were demands that the lands of the ungodly should be confiscated and re-distributed. The saints sought the encouragement of domestic production by a policy of protection and by a trade war against the Dutch, despite the fact that the latter were a Protestant nation. Beggars, debtors and thieves were all to be used as a pool of cheap labour for domestic industry. Despite the attacks on merchants, this programme cannot be classified simply as anti-capitalist. Its diversity is explained partly by the difference between the aspirations of the ministers and few gentry and those of the artisans. Yet even those who rebelled with Venner in 1661 called for protection and the utilization of beggars and thieves as cheap labour. Small masters saw the material advantages of such policies, even if they were 'capitalist' in tone. At the lowest social levels, the appeal of Fifth rtonarchism lay probably in the generalized vision of health and wealth and the prospects of revenue on all those who enjoyed social superiority. The Mosaic lows may have attracted the saints because their provisions ior thieves and debtors combined humanitarianism with the prospect of profit, but their introduction had in fact been urged by a long series of Protestant and Puritan writers. The demand reflected a and eneral Protestant interest in Jewish affairs. The concepts of the 'elect', the 'elect nation' and the 'second covenant', and the emphasis on the Bible directed interest towards the first chosen people, the 'people of the Book' and the first covenant. Many Fifth Monarchists and others looked for the conversion and return of the Jews, the adoption of the Mosaic Laws, and of the Seventh Day Sabbath, and one group adopted all the Jewish rites and proposed to rebuild the Temple. Chapter 9 examines the later history of the movement. The return of censorship ended the flow of Fifth Monarchist pamphlets, and the State Papers are the main source after 1660. Quarter-sessions records and visitation returns yielded a little information, but local officials for the most part failed to distinguish between the idiosyncrasies of the various sects. After tha Restoration, the movement gradually split into two parts. One of them became progressively more moderate, and was eventually absorbed into the Baptist and Congregationalist movements, which still retained pronounced millenarian tendencies. There is no evidence of a mass influx into Quakerism, as has sometimes been suggested. Relations between the Fifth Monarchists and Quakers were always very hostile; Quaker doctrines were highly offensive to the literalist and mostly predestinarian beliefs of the Fifth Monarchists. The second section turned towards violence, and participated in all the republican plots of the period, including the activities of Colonel Blood. In the 1670 s they became involved with the Exclusionists. The Fifth Monarchist cause finally <b>perished,</b> with the <b>Good</b> Old Cause as a whole, at Sedgemoor in 1685. In the conclusion (chapter 10) there is a brief survey of the development of millenarianism on the continent after Münster. A final summary follows. </p...|$|R
