5|$|Since {{the court}} had no {{capacity}} to review {{the merits of the}} decision and conclude whether Jehovah's Witnesses were a threat to public order, it was sufficient that the Minister had made Order 179 with the view that the existence of Jehovah's Witnesses, which forbade national service, was contrary to <b>public</b> <b>peace,</b> welfare and good order. The judge also remarked that notion of <b>public</b> <b>peace,</b> welfare and good order in the SA was similar to the concept of public order envisaged by Article 15(4) of the Constitution. Thus the rationale of maintaining public order behind Order 179 fell within the permitted categories spelt out in both section 24(1)(a) of the SA and Article 15(4) respectively.|$|E

5|$|Altrincham {{became a}} Free Borough, a self-governing township, {{when it was}} granted a charter in June 1290 by the Lord of the Manor, Hamon de MasseyV. The charter allowed for the {{creation}} of a merchants' guild, run by the town's burgesses to tax people passing through the borough. Burgesses were free men who lived in the town. The borough was ruled by a Court Leet and elected a mayor since at least 1452. Amongst the court's responsibilities were keeping the <b>public</b> <b>peace</b> and regulating the markets and fairs.|$|E
5|$|The appellants {{contended that}} under Article 15(4) of the Constitution {{restrictions}} {{on the right of}} freedom of religion could be imposed only if public order, public health or morality is affected, and section 24(1)(a) of the SA provides for registered organizations to be dissolved only if they threaten <b>public</b> <b>peace,</b> welfare or good order. The appellants therefore submitted that {{there had to be a}} clear and immediate danger to public order before freedom of religion can be circumscribed. Since the activities of Jehovah's Witnesses posed no such threat, the deregistration order was unconstitutional and ultra vires the SA.|$|E
5|$|In Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Public Prosecutor (1994), the Minister of Home Affairs had deregistered the Jehovah's Witnesses by Order No. 179/1972 made {{pursuant}} to section 24(1)(a) of the Societies Act. This provision {{allows for the}} dissolution of registered organizations considered to be threats to <b>public</b> <b>peace,</b> welfare or good order. The Minister had also made Order No. 123/1972 and Order No. 405/1994 {{pursuant to}} section 3(1) of the Undesirable Publications Act, prohibiting publications by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society relating to the Jehovah's Witnesses. The appellants were convicted in a district court for possession of prohibited publications. They appealed and sought to challenge {{the constitutionality of the}} Minister's prohibition order and the deregistration of the Jehovah's Witnesses, arguing that their right to freedom of religion guaranteed by Article 15(1) of the Constitution had been infringed.|$|E

5|$|The {{right of}} the laity to reject the person elected was {{abolished}} by a Synod held in the Lateran in 769, but restored to Roman noblemen by Pope Nicholas I during a Synod of Rome in 862. The pope was also subjected to oaths of loyalty to the Holy Roman Emperor, who had the duty of providing security and <b>public</b> <b>peace</b> in Rome. A major change came in 1059, when Pope Nicholas II decreed in In Nomine Domini that the cardinals were to elect a candidate, who would take office after receiving the assent of the clergy and laity. The cardinal bishops were to meet first and discuss the candidates before summoning the cardinal priests and cardinal deacons for the actual vote. The Second Council of the Lateran in 1139 removed the requirement for obtaining the assent of the lower clergy and the laity, while the Third Council of the Lateran in 1179 gave equal rights to the entire College of Cardinals when electing a new pope.|$|E
