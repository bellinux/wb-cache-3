Firstly we present {{the concept of}} <b>parasubordination</b> in italian law and we discuss {{legislative}} modifications developed in this matter lately. After we study how the concept of subordination has been developed in jurists and case law {{in order to show}} that <b>parasubordination</b> causes the reduction of subordination into its traditional and restricted concept. It happens because it’s the only way to distinguish <b>parasubordination</b> from subordination. We also demonstrate that labour rights and guarantees held by parasubordinate workers are insufficient and inferior when compared to subordinate workers. For this reason and based on the principle of equality we demonstrate that <b>parasubordination</b> is actually a kind of discrimination because there isn’t an objective and sufficient reason to distinguish <b>parasubordination</b> from subordination...|$|E
