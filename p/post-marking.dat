5000|$|On July 16, 2015, Gawker {{reporter}} Jordan Sargent {{posted a}} story about a gay porn star's alleged text correspondence with a married executive from a competing media company, Condé Nast. The article claimed Condé Nast CFO David Geithner had planned to go to Chicago to meet a male escort, and pay him $2,500 for sex. The article also claimed that after the escort requested Geithner settle the escort's housing dispute, he cancelled the meetup, and the escort went to Gawker to publicize the alleged incident. The post sparked heavy criticism for outing the executive, both within and outside Gawker. Denton removed the story the next day, after Gawker Media's managing partnership voted 4-2 to remove the <b>post—marking</b> the first time the website had [...] "removed a significant news story for any reason other than factual error or legal settlement." [...] On July 20, 2015, Gawker Media executive editor Tommy Craggs and Gawker.com editor-in-chief Max Read posted their resignations from the company, citing the lack of transparency by and independence from the company's management over the post's removal, rather than the concerns over the post's issues and received criticism, as the cause. Denton offered staff who disagreed with the actions a buyout option, which was accepted by staff including features editor Leah Finnegan and senior editor and writer Caity Weaver. Denton defended the story's writer, Sargent, who remained in his job.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA manufacture-ready {{design layout}} of a chip is {{vulnerable}} to authentication threats and infection with trojan horse in its fabrication facility or in a SoC house. The existing countermeasures are sensitive to process variation. We propose a layout watermarking scheme through reorientation of few dummy fills in the interconnect layer and resizing of few net segments. Layout watermarking is so performed {{that it has a}} controlled delay effect on the active paths leading to certain scan flip-flops chosen judicially. This delay effect can be captured as delay fault induced responses from the packaged chip while tested with a faster clock and a particular test vector pair, but the difference of <b>post-marking</b> delay with respect to the test clock period remains more than the effect of process variation. Results on overhead of watermarking and its robustness for ISCAS’ 85 benchmark circuits are encouraging...|$|E

40|$|Aedes albopictus (Skuse) is a container-breeding {{species with}} {{considerable}} public health importance. To date, Ae. albopictus oviposition behavior has been assessed in outdoor conditions, {{but only with}} laboratory-reared specimens. In outdoor large-cage and field studies, we used an attractive self-marking ovipositional device to assess Ae. albopictus skip oviposition behavior. In field studies, 37 wild Ae. albopictus that visited an attractive self-marking ovisite were subsequently captured at a sticky ovitrap within a 4 -d period. Because the average Ae. albopictus gonotrophic period is 4. 5 – 6 d, the wild-caught Ae. albopictus visited at least two oviposition sites within a single gonotrophic period. This provided field-based indirect evidence of skip oviposition. The mean distance traveled (MDT) during the 20 -d evaluations ranged from 58 to 78 ?m. The maximum observed distance traveled was 149 ?m, which was {{the outer edge of}} our trapping ability. As populations of Ae. albopictus increased, the MDT during the 4 - and 20 -d <b>post-marking</b> period increased significantly. Additional observations of wild-marked and captured Aedes triseriatus (Say) are discusse...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{challenges}} facing the management of undergraduate research projects is achieving and maintaining consistency in the marking process. High staff turnover, {{the introduction of new}} academics to supervisory teams and the desire to benchmark internationally exacerbate the challenge. The current assessment process within the Unitec Bachelor of Construction programme requires the student project first to be marked by the student’s supervisor. This is then followed by second, independent marking of all the student assignments by an external academic. When significant variation of marks occurs and <b>post-marking</b> negotiation between the markers cannot achieve agreement, a third independent marker is utilised. This paper outlines the development of an assessment rubric intended to provide clear standards and goals for both students and supervisors. The introduction of a rubric is intended {{to reduce the number of}} times significant variation in marks is experienced between markers. In cases where variation still occurs, the use of a rubric serves to define the problem and clarify the marking expectations. This assists with the negotiation process between the first and second markers, ideally removing the need for a third marker in most instances. In the most difficult of cases, negotiation will be required between three markers. Again, the use of the rubric allows a clear statement of the issues under discussion and the areas of divergence, allowing the participants to focus on reaching a satisfactory outcome...|$|E
40|$|Dermal spicules (or ‘ossicles’) of cultured sea {{cucumbers}} can be fluorescently marked with tetracycline and calcein for sea ranching and restocking but optimal immersion conditions are unknown. Lethal and non-lethal effects, and {{the efficacy of}} marking spicules in juvenile sandfish (Holothuria scabra), were examined under different immersion conditions. Fluorescence brightness {{and the proportion of}} marked spicules generally increased with concentration and duration of immersion. Frequency of burial (an indicator of stress) in sandfish increased with both fluorochromes at concentrations above 50 mg L− 1. Growth in the two weeks <b>post-marking</b> was unaffected at immersion concentrations of 50 and 100 mg L− 1 compared to controls, but appeared inhibited by immersion in solutions of 200 and 400 mg L− 1 of tetracycline or calcein. Sequential marking by tetracycline (yellow) and calcein (green), in either order, showed that calcein was deposited in a higher proportion of spicules. Three other fluorochromes with disparate colors, alizarin complexone, calcein blue and xylenol orange, also marked sandfish spicules and expanded the variety of dichromic combinations. Both tetracycline and calcein fluoresced more brightly when juveniles were marked at 26 or 30 °C than at 21 °C, and this low temperature appears also to reduce the proportion of spicules marked by tetracycline. Our findings show that seawater temperature should be regulated for ex situ immersion marking. The behavioral and biological sensitivities of sandfish demand care in administering the fluorochromes. Fluorochrome immersion at 100 mg L− 1 for 24 h at ≥ 26 °C provides a practical compromise between minimizing the fitness of released juveniles and ensuring the efficacy of the markers for studies on the growth and survival of {{sea cucumbers}} stocked in the wild...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Management of {{polar bear}} (Ursus maritimus) populations {{requires}} the periodic assessment of life history metrics such as survival rate. This information is frequently obtained during short-term capture and marking efforts (e. g., {{over the course}} of three years) that result in hundreds of marked bears remaining in the population after active marking is finished. Using 10 additional years of harvest recovery subsequent to a period of active marking, we provide updated estimates of annual survival for polar bears in the Baffin Bay population of Greenland and Canada. Our analysis suggests a decline in survival of polar bears since the period of active marking that ended in 1997; some of the decline in survival can likely be attributed to a decline in springtime ice concentration over the continental shelf of Baffin Island. The variance around the survival estimates is comparatively high because of the declining number of marks available; therefore, results must be interpreted with caution. The variance of the estimates of survival increased most substantially in the sixth year <b>post-marking.</b> When survival estimates calculated with recovery-only and recapture-recovery data sets from the period of active marking were compared, survival rates were indistinguishable. However, for the period when fewer marks were available, survival estimates were lower using the recovery-only data set, which indicates that part of the decline we detected for 2003 – 09 may be due to using only harvest recovery data. Nevertheless, the decline in the estimates of survival is consistent with population projections derived from harvest numbers and earlier vital rates, as well as with an observed decline in the extent of sea ice habitat.
