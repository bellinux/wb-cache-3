Most <b>transportation</b> problems consist <b>of</b> moving carriers of stationary cargos. Pipelines are unique {{in the sense that}} they are stationary carriers of moving cargos. As a consequence, the planning problem of these systems has singularities that make them very challenging. We present a PDDL model of the domain. Next, we comment on valid plans for some illustrative instances. We focus on the domain’s particularities, and suggest how the model may be enhanced to take into account real world restrictions...|$|R

We prove that, for any fixed ε> 0, there is no η 1 −ε-approximate algorithm for the SPTMP unless P=NP, where η is the input size. This result also holds if G is both planar and acyclic. If G is acyclic, then we give a m-approximate algorithm to SPTMP, where m is the number of arcs in G...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Calcium carbide waste paste {{is highly}} {{concentrated}} and viscous, rich in calcium, {{and has a}} great comprehensive utilization potential. Comprehensive utilization process based on high-pressure <b>pipeline</b> <b>transportation</b> is {{the best choice for}} use of calcium carbide waste. But the theory <b>of</b> <b>pipeline</b> <b>transportation</b> <b>of</b> the paste has rarely been reported. Industrial-scale transportation experiments with diameter of 75 mm, 100 mm, and 125 mm were conducted, respectively. The results show that the pipe pressure is linearly distributed along the pipeline, but it is piecewise linear. The pipe pressure in the front end drops faster than that in the back end of the pipeline. The pipe pressure is proportional to the flow rate of calcium carbide paste. The delivery resistance increases greatly as the pipe diameter decreases at the same flow rate...|$|R

5000|$|The gas {{condensate}} {{from the high}} pressure separator flows through a throttling control valve to a low pressure separator.
