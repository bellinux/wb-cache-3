The work is focused especially for plaster whose main binder is lime. The lime was in the past used to mortatrs to improve the properties for example adhesion to the substráte, workability, hygrophobic and more. The aim of practical part was to analyze the obtained historical mortar according to the methods mentioned in the theoretical part – determining individual components contained in historical mortar, composition ratio and <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>composition</b> of the repair mortars.

40|$|The solvent {{extraction}} performance of N,N’-dimethyl-N,N’- dibutylmalonamide (DMDBMA) in 1, 2 -dichloroethane (1, 2 -DCE) towards platinum(IV) and palladium(II) in hydrochloric acid media was systematically evaluated. Pt(IV) extraction (%E) increases with the HCl {{concentration in the}} aqueous phases, being always higher than 72 %, whereas Pd(II) extraction decreases from 65 % at 1 M HCl to 22 % at 8 M HCl. Several stripping agents for the two metals were tested: Pt(IV) is successfully recovered by a 1 M sodium thiosulfate solution, whereas the best result for Pd(II) was achieved with 0. 1 Mthiourea in 1 MHCl. The loading capacity of DMDBMA for Pt(IV) is high, and data obtained from successive extraction-stripping cycles suggest a good DMDBMA stability pattern. Attempts to replace 1, 2 -DCE by more environmentally- friendly diluents showed, in general, worse %E for Pt(IV). The dependence of Pt(IV) distribution coefficients on DMDBMA and chloride ion concentrations, {{as well as on}} acidity, are the basis of a <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>composition</b> of Pt(IV) extracted species...|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} issue <b>for</b> <b>the</b> left in the early 1980s was {{to change the system}} of election of the Leader of the Labour Party, which had until then been chosen solely by Labour MPs. The left wanted to have the Leader elected by an 'electoral college' which would include affiliated trade unions and individual Constituency Labour Parties. At the 1980 Labour Party conference a procedural motion to allow the change to be made without delay was narrowly carried after Heffer argued for it, but all <b>proposals</b> <b>for</b> balancing <b>the</b> <b>composition</b> of <b>the</b> electoral college were defeated and the issue was deferred until a special conference.|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} tasks which currently {{associated with the}} automated control people's access to resources of information systems for voice, are: - Control of the remote access of banks clients and inquiry services subscribers to information resources and reference information bank systems using a phone or other similar device; - Permanent control of operators access to information resources of transport and energy ergatic systems during the execution of their duties. On the basis of analyzing {{the conditions of the}} application are developed the concepts of building two types of access control systems (ACS). Each of the applications ACS has its own specific characteristics that determine <b>the</b> requirements <b>for</b> <b>the</b> respective systems. The introduction of the concept of building control systems of remote access users to the information resources of banks will allow for a significant increase in functionality of the ACS compared to the existing ones due to the additional control of the emotional state (EmS) of a subscriber and identification of subscribers for their lack of "blacklists" and detect scams. Development of the concept of building access control <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second version of their application was aimed at carrying out authentication, EmS control, identification of operators by continuous speech and control over the degree of fatigue of operators by the parameters that characterize the state of <b>the</b> cardiovascular system. <b>For</b> each type of ACS presented <b>proposals</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>composition</b> and construction of sub-systems and their constituent units, described the principles of operation of modules depending on the conditions which that characterize the area of application. A combination of different methods and approaches to building subsystems ACS (methods of wavelet transforms, cepstrum analysis, clustering, etc.), using artificial neural networks and algorithms that based on metrics allows to create an access control system with higher accuracy and speed comparing to existing systems, for use in various specific operating conditions. ???????? ????????? ? ????????? ????? ????????, ?????????? ? ???????????? ??????????????????? ???????? ??????? ????? ? ???????? ?????????????? ?????? ?? ??????, ????????: ? ???????? ?????????? ??????? ???????? ?????? ? ????????? ?????????? ????? ? ?????????????? ???????? ?????????? ? ?????????? ?????????????? ?????? ? ??????????? ???????? ??? ??????? ???????????? ??????????; ? ???????????? ???????? ??????? ?????????? ? ?????????????? ???????? ???????????? ? ?????????????? ???????????? ?????? ? ???????? ?????????? ??? ????? ?????????????? ????????????. ? ?????? ?? ?????? ??????? ???????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????????? ????????? ?????????? ???? ????? ?????? ???????? ???????

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{a lot of}} {{attention}} has been paid to the development of solid foundations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>composition</b> and inversion of schema mappings. In this paper, we review <b>the</b> <b>proposals</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> semantics of these crucial operators. For each of these proposals, we concentrate on the three following problems: the definition of the semantics of the operator, the language needed to express the operator, and the algorithmic issues associated to the problem of computing the operator. It should be pointed out that we primarily consider the formalization of schema mappings introduced in the work on data exchange. In particular, when studying the problem of computing <b>the</b> <b>composition</b> and inverse of a schema mapping, we will be mostly interested in computing these operators for mappings specified by source-to-target tuple-generating dependencies...|$|R
40|$|The {{liquid-liquid}} extraction of platinum(IV) and palladium(II) from hydrochloric acid media {{was carried out}} using N,N’-dimethyl-N,N’-dicyclohexylthiodiglycolamide (DMDCHTDGA) in 1, 2 -dichloroethane (1, 2 -DCE). Pt(IV) is efficiently extracted from 5 M HCl onwards (%E = 97 %), whereas Pd(II) is quantitatively recovered from 1 to 8 M HCl solutions. Both Pt(IV) and Pd(II) can be successfully stripped from the loaded organic phases, the former with a 1 M HCl solution, the latter with 0. 1 M thiourea in 1 M HCl. The maximum loading capacity of DMDCHTDGA for Pt(IV) could not be determined but it is high, since molar ratios extractant:Pt(IV) within 2 and 3 have been achieved. Data obtained from successive extraction-stripping cycles suggest a good stability profile of DMDCHTDGA towards Pt(IV) recovery. Attempts to replace 1, 2 -DCE by more environmentally-friendly diluents showed, in general, comparable %E for Pt(IV). The study {{of the influence of}} acidity, as well as chloride ion and DMDCHTDGA concentrations, allows a <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>composition</b> of the Pt(IV) species formed upon extraction. Results obtained with binary metal ion solutions point out that Pt(IV) and Pd(II) can be efficiently separated from DMDCHTDGA loaded organic phases through sequential selective stripping...|$|E
