5|$|On August 5, 2016, Eaton was {{reported}} missing by his sister Debbie. According to Tommy Dreamer, he was last seen in Atlanta, where a photo, which has since been deleted, showed him eating at the airport, and had no phone and was confused. A day later, Eaton was found safe. Pro wrestler Matt Sigmon posted a <b>photo</b> <b>on</b> his Twitter showing Eaton alongside himself.|$|E
5|$|The three vinyl LPs and booklet were housed {{inside a}} deep orange-coloured box. The 1991 CD release placed the cover <b>photo</b> <b>on</b> a white background, however, replicating {{the front of}} the {{original}} album booklet. As commentators noted in 1991, the necessary downsizing to CD dimensions meant that much of the effectiveness of the booklet photography was lost, not least because the contents had also been trimmed down to just 36 pages.|$|E

5|$|Mertens {{was named}} in Marc Wilmots' 23-man squad for Belgium's 2014 FIFA World Cup {{campaign}} in Brazil on 13 May 2014. In the nation's final warm-up {{match for the}} tournament on 7 June, Mertens scored a late winner to secure a 1–0 victory over Tunisia. He made his first appearance in Belgium's opening match of the World Cup, replacing Chadli at half time and scoring a late winner in a 2–1 victory over Algeria in Belo Horizonte. Prior to the World Cup, Mertens had made a bet with his father that he would score at the tournament. After the match, he posted a <b>photo</b> <b>on</b> Instagram of him shaving his father's mustache off as reward for winning the bet. He made five appearances in total at the World Cup as Belgium were eliminated in the quarter-finals {{at the hands of}} eventual runners-up, Argentina.|$|E
5|$|One {{young man}} kicked and smashed {{the window of}} a police car, lit a pack of matches, and set the {{upholstery}} on fire. After burning for a short time, the fuel tank exploded; a dozen more police cars and eight other automobiles would be destroyed in a similar fashion. The <b>photo</b> <b>on</b> the front cover of the Dead Kennedys 1980 album Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables, which shows several police cars on fire, was taken that night. Several crowd members threw tear gas, which they had stolen from police vehicles. Riots began to break out, with one mob disrupting traffic. Electric trollies were disabled when their overhead wires were pulled down, and violence broke out against the police officers, who were outnumbered. Police Chief Charles Gain, standing inside City Hall, ordered officers not to attack and to simply stand their ground.|$|E
5|$|The season three DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes, such as Michael arriving from Jamaica at the airport, wearing warm-weather clothes, Dwight, Meredith, Angela and Kevin separately reacting to the news that Michael took Jan to Jamaica, and Jan maintaining the ruse {{that she was in}} Scottsdale while talking to a coworker at Corporate, who is viewing the <b>photo</b> <b>on</b> his computer. Additional scenes include Dwight complaining about Jim's pranks while Michael was on vacation, Roy helping Ryan with inventory, Andy challenging Dwight to a box-stacking race, and Meredith climbing on a shelf, which falls and traps her.|$|E

5|$|Tom (Aziz Ansari) is {{tasked with}} taking the cover {{photo of the}} summer catalog, and convinces Ann (Rashida Jones) and Mark (Paul Schneider) to pose for photos at a {{community}} park. Tom is repeatedly frustrated with Ann, who has a difficult time appearing happy. When the photos are finished, Ann agrees that she looks miserable and asks that the pictures not be used. Mark appears concerned that Ann's unhappiness {{is a reflection of}} their relationship. She insists everything is fine, but he is unconvinced. Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) and Andy (Chris Pratt) appear to be growing closer. After helping Leslie set up her picnic, Andy asks whether April wants to get drinks after work, and she agrees. However, when they arrive at a bar, the bouncer (Mike Mauloff) easily notices April is underage, and her identification confirms she is 20. April tells Andy they can go to another bar, but Andy decides to go home instead, seemingly uncomfortable about their age difference. April is visibly disappointed, but does not convey it to Andy. Later, the summer catalogs arrive, with a <b>photo</b> <b>on</b> the cover of April and Andy appearing happy together at the picnic.|$|E

25|$|Larger fish, even {{predator}} fish such as {{the great}} barracuda in the <b>photo</b> <b>on</b> the left, often attract a retinue of small fish that accompany them in a strategically safe way. Skindivers who remain for long periods in the water, also often attract a retinue of fish, with smaller fishes coming in close, and larger fishes observing from a greater distance. Marine turtles, functioning as a mobile shelter for small fish, can be impaled accidentally by a swordfish trying to catch the fish.|$|E

Chapman & White (1970: 147-151) well described forest habitats of Dedza Mountain. The colour <b>photo</b> <b>on</b> the top of p.34 in Dowsett-Lemaire & Dowsett (2006) gives a good impression of the area, depicting “Low-canopy montane forest near the summit of Dedza Mountain (2150 m).”. In view of the geographic position of Dedza Mountain it is not unlikely for the species to occur in neighbouring Mozambique as well.|$|E
25|$|When the ice melted, {{the upper}} Great Lakes emptied into the Niagara River, which {{followed}} the rearranged topography across the Niagara Escarpment. In time, the river cut a gorge through the north-facing cliff, or cuesta. Because {{of the interactions}} of three major rock formations, the rocky bed did not erode evenly. The top rock formation was composed of erosion-resistant limestone and Lockport dolostone. That hard layer of stone eroded more slowly than the underlying materials. The aerial <b>photo</b> <b>on</b> the right clearly shows the hard caprock, the Lockport Formation (Middle Silurian), which underlies the rapids above the falls, and approximately the upper third of the high gorge wall.|$|E
