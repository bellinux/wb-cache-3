In 1994, these modules were introduced at all schools for <b>Preparatory</b> <b>Vocational</b> <b>Education</b> in the Netherlands. In the same year, these modules were analysed by a seminar of the University of Twente. The main conclusion {{is the lack of}} a feedback strategy. Apart from this evaluation, another method of analysing has been used. The 'events of instruction' by Gagné, Briggs & Wager (1992, p. 190) were followed in this study. Based on this study, the advice is to incorporate direct feedback in the modules. When modules are designed for individual use, a modular system providing highly teacher-independent feedback should be developed. For this study, special computer courses and tests have been developed, to be used by the students alongside the textbooks. The software is designed to provide two forms of direct, complex feedback, after each frame. A frame is defined as a small part of a module. One feedback strategy is known as ’knowledge of correct response’ (KCR). The other strategy is a more extensive KCR strategy called KCR+. In this study, the effects of both variants are analysed.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the extent of systematic examination of students’ educational (support) needs by teachers participating in lesson study (LS) meetings within a framework of formative assessment (FA). Design/methodology/approach: The study took place in the context of upper <b>preparatory</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> in the Netherlands. The learning trajectory of two LS teams was examined qualitatively, using the framework of FA to analyze teachers’ explorative talk during LS-meetings. The sample included Dutch language teachers and mathematics teachers. Findings: Findings revealed how the process of FA was intertwined with the LS process. Systematic examination of teaching practice was partly identified, however, FA was frequently inadequately applied. Teachers tended to rush into talk about pedagogics, instead of identification of goals and students’ educational (support) needs. In total, 12 characteristics of teacher talk were related to the extent to which FA was applied. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this study suggest that guidance and support during LS-meetings is desirable for systematic practices during LS-meetings and this guidance and support should adapt to specific weaknesses and strengths of a LS team. Originality/value: This study builds on previous findings suggesting that a systematic approach is important for teachers during LS-meetings. The findings provide a starting point for realizing the potential of LS in <b>preparatory</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>education,</b> by revealing potential pitfalls of systematic practice during LS-meetings.

In this paper {{we describe the}} study protocol of the Dutch, school-based program ‘Focus on Strength’ that aims to improve body composition of 11 – 13 year old students, and with that to ultimately improve their quality of life. Methods The development of this intervention {{is based on the}} Intervention Mapping (IM) protocol, which starts from a needs assessment, uses theory and empirical research to develop a detailed intervention plan, and anticipates program implementation and evaluation. This novel intervention targets first year students in <b>preparatory</b> secondary <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> (11 – 13 years of age). Teachers are the program implementers. One part of the intervention involves a 30  % increase of strength exercises in the physical education lessons. The other part is based on Motivational Interviewing, promoting autonomous motivation of students to become more physically active outside school. Performance and change objectives are described for both teachers and students. The effectiveness of the intervention will be tested in a Randomized Controlled Trial in 9 Dutch high schools.

What opinions do both students and teachers have on CSCL? Method The study is carried out in a secondary school in the Netherlands, The Raayland College in Venray. The Raayland is a school that includes all types of secondary education: Gymnasium, pre-university education (VWO), senior secondary education (HAVO), junior secondary education (MAVO) and <b>preparatory</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> (VBO). It is a school with 2. 300 students and 158 teachers. The Raayland College is a so-called pioneering school. About 120 of 700 high schools in the Netherlands receive extra money from the Department of Education of the government to introduce computers in their curriculum. The aim of this initiative is that partner schools share their experiences with other schools, which do not receive extra funding. The Raayland College is present on the World Wide Web. Participating in this project fits well in this context of a computer supported collaborative learning environment.

40|$|Title Parents’ {{perceptions}} on {{parental involvement}} in school health education. Background Secondary school has been recognized as an important setting for school health education. One large group where an unhealthy lifestyle could be prevented is that of adolescents attending <b>preparatory</b> secondary <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> [PSVE]. Parental involvement is often advocated as important for health education, because of their function as role model. However, parents are often not eager to involve and there is minimal understanding of the perceptions and opinions of parents about their involvement in school health education. Aim and research question The present study aimed to get insight in parents’ perceptions on parental involvement regarding health education. The study explored parents’ perceptions about their involvement in school health education, school-and home responsibilities and how they perceive desired versus actual involvement. Method Qualitative research was conducted, comprising three focus groups with twenty Dutch parents of adolescents attending PSVE. Results The results suggested that parents perceived their role to be most important in adolescents health. School should function as a supervisor. The majority of parents did not {{feel the need to}} be more involved in decision making regarding health related topics. Parents did like the possibility of attending school education programs for parents. Mixed opinions existed on schools’ role in forwarding information about unhealthy behavior of adolescents to parents, as most parents experienced this as an interference. Conclusion and recommendations Parents do not always prefer an enhanced role in school health education. An interesting finding because of the growing interest of the Dutch government to increase parent- school interaction regarding health. Therefore, a discussion is warranted about the interpretation of an increased educational partnership, with specific attention paid to the boundaries of responsibilities...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} a design {{research}} project about a learning, supervising and teaching strategy to enable students in agricultural <b>preparatory</b> <b>vocational</b> secondary <b>education</b> (VMBO) to recognize the functionality of biological knowledge of reproduction in work placement sites. Although biological knowledge can be functionally used in many work placement sites it is not evident that students recognize {{that this is the}} case. Workplace characteristics, participation in work actions and workplace discourse strongly influence which knowledge is being verbalized and what can be learned in a workplace. The purpose of this project wasto provide theoretically and empirically grounded design characteristics for a workplace- and school-integrated educational strategy that enables students to recognize the functionality of disciplinary knowledge in the workplace. A literature study was conducted in search of theory-based design characteristics for such a strategy. These characteristics were used as a frame of reference for identifying problems and prospects of work placements in current agricultural VMBO. To gain insight into relationships between biological knowledge of animal reproduction and workplace actions in cattle farms and horse breeding farms educational materials were analysed and workplace supervisors and biology teachers were interviewed. This resulted in an overview of relationships to be found in <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> practice. Based on the findings of the literature study, the identified problems and prospects and the overview of relationships an integrated school and workplace learning strategy was designed and field tested in two iterations. The strategy describes and justifies aligned student and supervisor actions and the expected learning outcomes, and mirrors a hypothetical learning trajectory. Each field test included six small-scale case studies, and focused on the practicability and effectiveness of the strategy. Data was collected at several moments during the work placement period using a multi-method approach. Results were obtained by analysing completed student assignments, recorded supervision talks, and administered interviews with students and supervisors. In the second field test additional lessons at school were also analysed. Besides insight in the practicability and effectiveness of each strategy component the project yielded seven theoretically and empirically grounded characteristics for a practicable and effective learning, supervising and teaching strategy that enables VMBO students to recognize the functionality of biological knowledge of reproduction in animal husbandry work placement sites. Finally, the applicability in other vocational contexts was discussed resulting is a general didactical structure for integrating school and workplace learning. The thesis concludes with discussing limitations of the design research, implications for the main curriculum components in VMBO and suggestions for further research...|$|R
40|$|M. Ed. The study under {{discussion}} followed on {{a request to}} develop a programme which would fill the existing gap between general formative preparatory academic education and general formative <b>preparatory</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>education.</b> The background of the precarious beginnings of education in South Africa was reviewed with specific reference to technical education. A study of the available literature confirmed {{that there is a}} need for more technically trained people, technically trainable people, students who have completed their technical vocational studies, an orientation programme and lecturers with management skills. The purpose of the study is, therefore, to investigate how lecturers managed the orientation programme at technical colleges. Technical colleges which acted as facilitators of the orientation programme, was introduced. This post-school institution with its general functions of continuing vocational education, must fulfil the needs of the community and the requirements of the industry it wishes to serve. The function and place of technical colleges were discussed as well as the management functions of education institutions, lecturers and students. The development of the orientation programme was also discussed. A suitable programme had to be developed to orientate students at a technical college. After making a few alterations, Jansen's model for curriculum development was used. Curriculum developers firstly, had to determine what the students had already achieved and secondly, what was expected from students at the end of the orientation programme. After this gap between the achieved and the expected had been clearly identified, the orientation programme could be developed. This programme was tested as a pilot programme, declared as general policy; and then implemented at technical colleges and private training institutions on a national level. The successful implementation of such an orientation programme depends, inter alia, on the classroom management skills of the lecturer. In an attempt to evaluate the success of the lecturers' management skills, a questionnaire was developed as an measuring instrument. The questionnaire was completed by orientation students to determine the management skills of the lecturer. The design of the above questionnaire covered five management aspects, namely, classroom activities, student activities, interpersonal relationships, activities during lesson presentation and administrative duties. Forty four questions were designed and approximately eight questions for each management aspect were included in the questionnaire. An experimental group selected from sixteen technical colleges, was requested to complete the questionnaire voluntarily. These colleges are situated in rural districts, semi-urban and typically urban areas. The students originated from all levels of the community and no preference was given to race, sex, language or background. A total of 177 students participated in this survey. The questionnaire was completed under examination conditions but there was no specific time restriction. All participants were enrolled for all five orientation subjects, namely, engineering technology, engineering drawing, engineering science, industrial communication and mathematics. The performance ability of the students covered the whole spectrum. For admission to the programme, the lowest and highest standard the repondents had obtained, were restricted to Stds 6 to 10 for statistical reasons. To increase the validity and usefulness of the questionnaire, the items in the measuring instrument were checked to ensure that they were based on the managerial competency of the lecturer. The content validity of the measuring instrument was improved in this manner. The Department of Education gave its approval that technical colleges be used for this investigation. On the basis of the empirical investigation, it was discovered that during the first order (PFA) factor analysis, nine factors were identified from the 44 items which appeared in the questionnaire. A second order factor analysis indicated that the 44 items could be reduced to one factor with a reliability coefficient of 0, 948. When only 39 items are considered the reliability increases to 0, 950 and this factor was named "efficient management. " In conclusion, the 39 items can be considered to be one scale and it represents the lecturers' efficient management of the various classroom activities. This factor was also tested by means of multiple statistical techniques in an attempt to find significant differences between the various independent groups. No significant statistical differences were discovered between the scale averages of the various groups. This was an indication that the groups held the same opinion about the management of the orientation programme. With the high average scale marks obtained by the various participating colleges, this investigation proved that lecturers had succeeded to manage the orientation programme successfully. The research results showed that, according to the opinion of the students, no significant statistical differences existed in the lecturers' management of the orientation programme to orientate students towards vocational education. There are however a few deficiencies noticeable in the competency of lecturers in certain management aspects. This research gives an indication of some problems which currently exist with the presentation of the orientation programme. Clear solutions cannot be provided. However the research does indicate that an orientation programme can be successfully presented at technical colleges with the necessary awareness, adaptation, training and positive attitudes as needed by the community, the world of work and the country...|$|E
