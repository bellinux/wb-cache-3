40|$|Abstract − The <b>positional</b> <b>deviation</b> (difference {{between the}} actual and target position) {{belongs to the}} {{important}} criteria that describe the performance of numerically controlled axes. The procedure for determination of such deviation is described in the international standard ISO 230 - 2 : 1997. This standard provides calculation of the <b>positional</b> <b>deviation</b> only in several discrete (measuring) points. Moreover it does not consider effects of the measuring instrument on the obtained results. The new methodology is adopted and it is enables estimation of the <b>positional</b> <b>deviation</b> in any point of the axis travel, together with the uncertainty of such estimate. Obtained results {{can be incorporated into}} a control system in the form of corrections enhancing positioning possibilities of individual axes. The paper introduces procedures that were verified by measurements for one linear axis. The more complicated situation occurs for testing the positioning accuracy in a plane or in a space. Paper also talks about possibilities of using such a measurement in process of controlling for compensation. Such compensation can bring great improvement in positional accuracy of machine tools...|$|E

40|$|Novel {{pressure}} sensors {{characterized by a}} hybrid setup of both plastic and glass have been presented. Concepts {{have been developed for}} the fabrication of {{pressure sensors}} using the low-cost AMANDA process. These concepts have then been evaluated on the basis of specifications made by industry. This has resulted in a new product concept with the pressure sensor mainly consisting of two molded housing parts, a carrier membrane, and a circular measurement plate made of glass. Mechanical stresses or strains occurring in the housing are not transferred to the sensitive part of the measurement plate, as the latter is connected to the housing via a thin, slack carrier membrane. In case of a pressure gradient prevailing in the housing, the measurement plate rests against the one or the other side, while its bearing at the edge remains the same. One housing shell is designed as a hollow sphere. Here, a circular plate always contacts along its edges irrespective of <b>positional</b> <b>deviations.</b> On the other side, the measurement plate is always borne by a polyimide ring fixed {{to the bottom of the}} housing. This even holds in case of <b>positional</b> <b>deviations.</b> On its surface, the measurement plate is equipped with strain gauges that measure the strain of the measurement plate under a pressure load. To specify the layout of the strain gauges, the stress and strain behavior on the calculated free measurement plate was described by mathematical equations. Furthermore, equations were derived for the variation of strain gauge resistance on the plate. These equations were entered into a computer program, by means of which the characteristics could be simulated as a function of strain gauge layout. 12 pressure sensors were manufactured in parallel with each pressure sensor containing a measurement plate of 2084 #mu#m in diameter, which was etched from 50 #mu#m thick glass substrates. This diameter ensures a linear relationship between central deflection and pressure difference in case of the measurement plate being subjected to pressure differences of #+-# 1000 hPa. (orig.)

40|$|Analysis of {{extended}} molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of lysozyme in vacuo and {{in aqueous solution}} reveals {{that it is possible}} to separate the configurational space into two subspaces: (1) an ''essential'' subspace containing only a few degrees of freedom in which anharmonic motion occurs that comprises most of the positional fluctuations; and (2) the remaining space in which the motion has a narrow Gaussian distribution and which can be considered as ''physically constrained. '' If overall translation and rotation are eliminated, the two spaces can be constructed by a simple linear transformation in Cartesian coordinate space, which remains valid over several hundred picoseconds. The transformation follows from the covariance matrix of the <b>positional</b> <b>deviations.</b> The essential degrees of freedom seem to describe motions which are relevant for the function of the protein, while the physically constrained subspace merely describes irrelevant local fluctuations.

Methods: Anthropomorphic phantoms of head-and-neck (H&N) and pelvic regions were scanned by the computed tomography-simulator. A common reference standard setup position for each phantom was determined. Markings of known deviations from the standard position in the lateral, longitudinal and yaw displacements were made on the phantoms. The verifications by kV CBCT and MVCT were conducted in the linear accelerator and helical tomotherapy treatment unit respectively. The phantoms were then shifted in steps according to the assigned different degree of <b>positional</b> <b>deviations.</b> The discrepancy between the detected data and the known data (δD) indicated the detection error of the verification system.

Finally,the nonlinear cascade control algorithm of the joint-structure in high-speed maglev train was introduced.

40|$|Performance of {{contemporary}} high-tech equipment {{is more and}} more determined by accuracy. <b>Positional</b> <b>deviations</b> due to high frequent vibrations in the floor can be suppressed by mounting the equipment on a frame that acts as a low-pass filter, but low frequent deviations and deviations due to motions inside the machine can only be reduced by increasing the machine frame stiffness. When only passive elements are used during design, large stiffness can only be attained with rigid bodies, which often exhibit bad dynamic behaviour. In case a machine should be both accurate and fast, a design with active elements should be considered. The Smart Disc is an example of such an active element. It integrates a piezoelectric sensor, a piezoelectric actuator and control electronics, such that it expands when it experiences a compressing force, and vice versa. Insertion of Smart Discs at discrete locations in a machine might compensate for the lack of frame stiffness. To evaluate the feasibility of the Smart Disc concept an experimental set-up has been designed. Though only one prototype Smart Disc is utilised, the set-up resembles a large class of machines suffering from deviations caused by the non-infinite frame stiffness and non-filtered vibrations in the floor. Experiments with this set-up show a reduction of the positional error of interest in the order of 20 dB in a frequency range of 0. 1 to 10 Hz. ...|$|R

This transformation can be represented by orthogonal transformation or geometric perspective transformation. The model of orthogonal transformation is a model in which {{the appearance of the}} imaging plane does not change with the positional change of the camera in the environment, and the geometric perspective model changes according to the position change of the camera.

The image information includes not only the path, but also the environment and noise interference. The purpose of preprocessing is to remove various noise interferences, distinguish the environment from the path, and identify the path. After image pre-processing, the path is basically separated from the environment, and the path is the area between two lines with a certain width. In order to more easily extract the <b>positional</b> <b>deviation</b> and angular deviation of the path, the centerline position of the path is fitted to a straight line in this design, and its width is ignored.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Coiled {{coils of}} {{different}} order were investigated using infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Recently, we demonstrated that dimeric coiled coils display unique vibrational spectra {{with at least}} three separable bands instead of only one band of a classical R-helix in the amide I region. This was attributed to a distortion of the helical structure by the supercoil bending, giving rise to bands that are not observed in the undistorted helix. Here, we investigated coiled coils forming trimers, tetramers, and pentamers. These higher order coiled coils, in general, possess larger superhelical pitches, resulting in a smaller helical distortion. We found that all coiled coils studied, including the native dimeric GCN 4 leucine zipper and its variants leading to parallel trimers and tetramers {{as well as the}} rod portions of fibritin (parallel trimer), R-actinin (antiparallel spectrin type trimer), and COMP (parallel pentamer), displayed the typical three band pattern of the coiled coil amide I spectra. However, the separation of these three bands and their <b>positional</b> <b>deviation</b> from the classical R-helical band position was correlated to the extent of the helical distortion as reflected by the pitch values of the supercoils. The most pronounced spectral anomaly was found for the tropomyosin dimer with a reported helical pitch of 137 Å, whereas the smallest spectral distortion was found for the pentameric COMP complex and the tetrameric leucine zipper mutant, both with a pitch of about 205 Å.

The results show that the filtering performances of the asymmetric structures (θ≠ 0 ∘) are greatly improved in comparison with the symmetric structure (θ= 0 ∘). For most of the asymmetric structures, there is a transmission minimum at the slightly bigger wavelength than one at which the transmission peak appears for the symmetric structures, and there is still a transmission peak at the wavelength of the transmission peak of the symmetric structures. Moreover, the difference between the transmission peak and valley is increased, and the breadth of the transmission peak becomes narrow...|$|R
40|$|A cone beam {{computed}} tomography (CBCT) scanner integrated with a linear accelerator {{is a powerful}} tool for image guided radiotherapy. Respiratory motion, however, induces artifacts in CBCT, while the respiratory correlated procedures, developed to reduce motion artifacts in axial and helical CT are not suitable for such CBCT scanners. We have developed an alternative respiratory correlated procedure for CBCT and evaluated its performance. This respiratory correlated CBCT procedure consists of retrospective sorting in projection space, yielding subsets of projections that each corresponds to a certain breathing phase. Subsequently, these subsets are reconstructed into a four-dimensional (4 D) CBCT dataset. The breathing signal, required for respiratory correlation, was directly extracted from the 2 D projection data, removing the need for an additional respiratory monitor system. Due to the reduced number of projections per phase, the contrast-to-noise ratio in a 4 D scan reduced by a factor 2. 6 - 3. 7 compared to a 3 D scan based on all projections. Projection data of a spherical phantom moving with a 3 and 5 s period with and without simulated breathing irregularities were acquired and reconstructed into 3 D and 4 D CBCT datasets. The <b>positional</b> <b>deviations</b> of the phantoms center of gravity between 4 D CBCT and fluoroscopy were small: 0. 13 +/- 0. 09 mm for the regular motion and 0. 39 +/- 0. 24 mm for the irregular motion. Motion artifacts, clearly present in the 3 D CBCT datasets, were substantially reduced in the 4 D datasets, even in the presence of breathing irregularities, such that the shape of the moving structures could be identified more accurately. Moreover, the 4 D CBCT dataset provided information on the 3 D trajectory of the moving structures, absent in the 3 D data. Considerable breathing irregularities, however, substantially reduces the image quality. Data presented for three different lung cancer patients were in line with the results obtained from the phantom study. In conclusion, we have successfully implemented a respiratory correlated CBCT procedure yielding a 4 D dataset. With respiratory correlated CBCT on a linear accelerator, the mean position, trajectory, and shape of a moving tumor can be verified just prior to treatment. Such verification reduces respiration induced geometrical uncertainties, enabling safe delivery of 4 D radiotherapy such as gated radiotherapy with small margin...|$|R
