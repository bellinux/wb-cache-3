50|$|Optical {{radiation}} of {{any kind}} with enough intensity can cause damage to the eyes and skin including <b>photoconjunctivitis</b> and photokeratitis. Researchers have questioned whether limiting blue light exposure could {{reduce the risk of}} age-related macular degeneration. It is reported that bright light therapy may activate the production of reproductive hormones, such as testosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and estradiol.|$|E
40|$|Photoconjuctivitis was an {{inflammation}} of conjunctiva caused by welding processes in manufacturing which has ultraviolet radiation. The welder {{who had experienced}} with arc welding will have photoconjuctivitis after 4 - 6 hours in welding process because it has ultraviolet radiation. Appropriate treatment for those welder is {{that they should have}} at least 2 days off from welding process. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) was a green welding with no fumes, no flares, and no ultraviolet radiation. But, there was no any study before which described the effects on human caused by FSW. This study aimed to analyze the differentiation of <b>photoconjunctivitis</b> by arc welding and friction stir welding. The study was quasi-experimental study with non randomized pretest-postest control group design. The subjects of this study amounted to 16 as sampels. The result showed that the photoelectrical conjunctivitis has increased 31, 25 %, Mann-Whitney test showed that there was no difference of <b>photoconjunctivitis</b> by pre welding for those group (p= 1, 000), Wilcoxon test showed that there was no difference of <b>photoconjunctivitis</b> by pre-post welding in FSW group (p= 1, 000), Wilcoxon test showed that there was a differentiation of <b>photoconjunctivitis</b> by pre-post welding in arc welding group (p= 0, 025) and with Mann-Whitney test showed that there was a difference of <b>photoconjunctivitis</b> by post welding for those group (p= 0, 015). FSW might be considered that it is better for welding process because it has no fumes, no flares, and no ultraviolet radiation, but in fact, that method was not officially perfect, because that method still has fumes, metal flakes, and the probe might be apart in process...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{previous}} studies have discussed the risk of eye damage from broadband ultraviolet (UV) radiation. As the biologically damaging effectiveness of UV irradiation on {{the human body is}} known to be wavelength-dependent, it is necessary to study the distribution of the UV spectral irradiance. In order to quantify the ocular biologically effective UV (UVBE) irradiance exposure of different wavelengths and assess the risk of eye damage, UV exposure values were measured at Sanya, China (18. 4 ° N, 109. 7 °E, altitude 18 m), using a manikin and a dual-detector spectrometer to measure simultaneously the ocular exposure and ambient UV spectral irradiance data and solar elevation angle (SEA) range (approximately 7 °- 85 °). The present study uses the ocular UV spectral irradiance exposure weighted with the action spectra for photokeratitis, <b>photoconjunctivitis</b> and cataracts to calculate the ocular UVBE irradiance exposure for photokeratitis (UVBE(pker)), <b>photoconjunctivitis</b> (UVBE(pcon)) and cataracts (UVBE(cat)). We found that the ocular exposure to UV irradiance is strongest in the 30 °- 60 ° SEA range when ∼ 50 % of ocular exposure to UV irradiance on a summer's day is received. In the 7 °- 30 ° SEA range, all the biologically highly effective wavelengths of UVBE(pker), UVBE(pcon) and UVBE(cat) irradiances are at 300 nm. However, in other SEA ranges the biologically highly effective wavelengths of UVBE(pker), UVBE(pcon) and UVBE(cat) irradiances are different, corresponding to 311 nm, 300 nm and 307 nm, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{light is}} {{the most common cause of}} {{radiation}} injury to the eye wich in acute exposure causes photokeratitis and <b>photoconjunctivitis.</b> After a hole day exposure to the sun on the Mediteranian coast patient presented with mixed conjunctival injection, chemosis, edematous corneal epithelium with superficially present fluoresceine positive small pinpoint defects. Epithelial bullous changes, circular stromal infiltration in the middle stromal perifery and reduction of corneal transparency were more pronounced on the left eye. After treatment moderate conjunctival injection remained together with circular stromal infiltration in the middle perifery, corneas were transparent, epithelialised and fluorescein negative. Anterior chambers and lenses were clear. One month after patient regained bilateral visual acuity of 1. 0. To our kownoledge, this case shows for the first time connection between acute ultraviolet radiation exposure and persistent circular stromal infiltration in the middle corneal perifery in humans...|$|E
40|$|The {{anterior}} {{layers of}} the eye, particularly the cornea and conjunctiva, are important in ultraviolet (UV) light absorp-tion. The physiologic effects of UV rays on these layers are strictly correlated with their wavelengths. Accordingly, the UV spectrum is subdivided into three classes: UVA (320 – 400 nm), UVB (290 – 320 nm), and UVC (200 – 290 nm) [1]. Studies have shown that UVB radiation confers {{a higher risk of}} ocular surface disease than does UVA [2, 3]. UV radiation, especially UVB, {{plays a major role in}} the pathogenesis of both photo-keratitis and <b>photoconjunctivitis</b> [2, 3] through its ability to cause direct and indirect cellular damage. This involves a complex process of cell death, matrix remodeling, oxida-tive stress, and inflammation [4 - 7]. Therefore, there is great demand for novel and effective strategies aimed at reducing UV photodamage and associated visual health problems...|$|E
40|$|For {{the solar}} {{elevation}} angles of 33 to 39 degrees in this research, the erythemal UV {{measured in the}} direction of the wall material was of the order of 0. 4 MED/h where an MED is defined as a minimum erythemal dose. The UV albedo calculated as the ratio of the irradiance {{in the direction of}} the wall and the solar irradiance on a horizontal plane for human erythema was 0. 27, 0. 24, 0. 22 and 0. 19 for the MDF, black plastic, grey colourbond and green colourbond respectively. In comparison, employing the <b>photoconjunctivitis</b> action spectrum, the albedo was 0. 23, 0. 21, 0. 20 and 0. 15 for the MDF, black plastic, grey colourbond and green colourbond respectively. The measured UV albedo may be due to the UV albedo from the material and the diffuse component of the UV solar radiation. This is shown by the albedo of 0. 15 and 0. 20 for the UVA (320 to 400 nm) and UVB (280 to 320 nm) respectively for the green colourbond. At the shorter wavelengths, there is a greater fraction of diffuse radiation...|$|E
40|$|Summary This review {{has been}} {{prepared}} to provide a perspective {{to a number of}} controversial views which have been voiced in recent years concerning fluorescent ia~nps as potential health hazards. Various influences are briefly considered and include the effects of fluorescent lighting on the skin, eyes, stress, the pineal gland and the ’sick building syndrome’. Consideration is also given to the effects of glare and flicker and passing reference is made to polychlorinated biphenyls and their role in lighting equipment. It is concluded that some of the so-called hazards from fluorescent lamps in normal use, such as skin cancer, although they cannot be totally discounted, have a very small likelihood of occurrence and that no symptoms of erythema, <b>photoconjunctivitis</b> or photakerautis are likely with ordinary use. The effects of other factors such as glare and flicker are known to cause distraction and discomfort for some people and sometimes headaches, but the causes of these effects need to be better understood. It is suggested that the absence of windows and lack of visual variety in interior design may exert a greater influence on complaints about lighting, especially in the ’sick building syndrome’, than any radiation from fluorescent lamps. ...|$|E
