The head and roller spin the can in a complete circle to seal all the way around. Then a pressure roller with a different profile drives the two edges together under pressure to make a gas-tight seal. Filled cans usually have pressurized gas inside, which makes them stiff enough for easy handling.|$|R
40|$|Sorption-enhanced water–gas shift (SEWGS) {{combines}} the water–gas shift reaction with in situ adsorption of CO 2 on potassium-promoted hydrotalcite (K-HTC) and thereby allows production of hot, high pressure H 2 from syngas {{in a single}} unit operation. SEWGS is a cyclic process, that comprises high pressure adsorption and rinse, pressure equalisation, and low <b>pressure</b> <b>purge.</b> Here, results are presented of a SEWGS cycle design study, based on recently developed expressions for the interaction of CO 2 and H 2 O with K-HTC. It is shown that during the cycle, steam adsorbs in the rinse step and desorbs during the subsequent reduction in pressure, thereby improving the CO 2 purity in the column and thus enhancing {{the efficiency of the}} rinse. A parameter study based on numerical simulations shows that the carbon capture ratio depends mainly on the purge steam to carbon feed ratio, whereas the CO 2 product purity depends mainly on the rinse steam to carbon feed ratio. An optimisation yields a SEWGS cycle that consumes significantly less steam than cycle designs previously reported in the literature...|$|R

50|$|A third {{method of}} {{constructing}} composite materials {{is known as}} a dry layup. Here, the carbon fiber material is already impregnated with resin (pre-preg) and is applied to the mold in a similar fashion to adhesive film. The assembly is then placed in a vacuum to cure. The dry layup method has the least amount of resin waste and can achieve lighter constructions than wet layup. Also, because larger amounts of resin are more difficult to bleed out with wet layup methods, pre-preg parts generally have fewer pinholes.

40|$|Laser rock {{spallation}} is a rock {{removal process}} that utilizes laser-induced thermal stress to fracture the rock into small fragments before melting {{of the rock}} occurs. High intensity laser energy, applied on a rock that normally has very low thermal conductivity, concentrates locally on the rock surface area and causes the local temperature to increase instantaneously. The maximum temperature just below the melting temperature {{can be obtained by}} carefully controlling the laser parameters. This results in a local thermal stress in subsurface that is enough to spall the rock. This process continues on a new rock surface with the aid of the high <b>pressure</b> gas <b>purging</b> blowing away the cracked fragments.

Propellant loading was initiated on 22 March, 1993 at 1 : 15 AM EST. All SSME chill parameters and launch commit criteria (LCC) were nominal. At engine start plus 1. 44 seconds, a Failure Identification (FID) was posted against Engine 2011 for exceeding the 50 psia Oxidizer Preburner (OPB) <b>purge</b> <b>pressure</b> redline. The engine {{was shut down}} at 1. 50 seconds followed by Engines 2034 and 2030. All shut down sequences were nominal and the mission was safely aborted. The OPB <b>purge</b> <b>pressure</b> redline violation and the abort profile/overlay for all three engines are depicted. SSME Avionics hardware and software performed nominally during the incident. A review of vehicle data table (VDT) data and controller software logic revealed no failure indications other than the single FID 013 - 414, OPB <b>purge</b> <b>pressure</b> redline exceeded. Software logic was executed according to requirements {{and there was no}} anomalous controller software operation. Immediately following the abort, a Rocketdyne/NASA failure investigation team was assembled. The team successfully isolated the failure cause to the oxidizer preburner augmented spark igniter purge check valve not being fully closed due to contamination. The source of the contaminant was traced to a cut segment from a rubber O-ring which was used in a fine clean tool during valve production prior to 1992. The valve was apparently contaminated during its fabrication in 1985. The valve had performed acceptably on four previous flights of the engine, and SSME flight history shows 780 combined check valve flights without failure. The failure of an Engine 3 (SSME No. 2011) check valve to close was sensed by onboard engine instruments even though all other engine operations were normal.

40|$|New pressure-swing {{adsorption}} (PSA) {{processes and}} PSA hybrids are developed for several commercially relevant gas separations. The Combination Cycles and Cycling-Zone Pressure-Swing Adsorption (CZPSA), respectively, use feed purge to supplement and replace product purge and are high recovery {{alternatives to the}} Skarstrom Cycle when lower product purities are acceptable. For air separation, the Skarstrom Cycle produces ∼ 88 % O 2 with pressurized O 2 recovery of ∼ 44 % while CZPSA produces ∼ 72 % O 2 with pressurized O 2 recovery of 75 % at the same productivity. To achieve high purity O 2 and N 2, CZPSA is coupled with cryogenic distillation to form a hybrid air separation process. By removing excess N 2, the CZPSA unit decreases the size of downstream equipment, thereby decreasing costs. When capital costs dominate, placing the CZPSA unit after the main air compressor (MAC) in a hybrid air separation plant reduces capital cost by up to ∼ 27 %, but power increases by ∼ 16 %. When both capital and operating costs dominate, placing the CZPSA unit before the MAC reduces operating cost by up to ∼ 7 % and capital costs by up to ∼ 9 %. An existing 1000 mtpd air separation plant can be retrofitted with a pre-MAC CZPSA unit to increase the plant capacity by ∼ 12 % with a 6 % increase in incremental capital costs and a 55 % increase in incremental operating costs. For dilute binary gas separation, hybrid SMB/PSA processes are developed by combining stripping-type PSA with a gas-phase SMB. As conceived, SMB/PSA has two advantages: low <b>pressure</b> <b>purge</b> and internal desorbent generation. For the two-zone, two-train SMB/PSA process, binary separation of enflurane into its 99 % pure R- and S-enantiomers is achieved at D/F ∼ 15. 0; the gas-phase SMB achieves this with D/F ∼ 54. 0. Stripping- and rectifying-type PSA typically {{are not used to}} achieve complete binary separation because of low productivities. The gas-phase SMB is combined with these processes to achieve binary separation of a concentrated feed of H 2 and CH 4 with zeolite 5 A. An eight-bed combination of stripping- and rectifying- type SMB/PSA processes produces 99. 99 % H 2 with 99. 6 % H 2 recovery and 99 % CH 4 with 99. 9 % CH 4 recovery with productivity of 9. 37 E- 5 mol/kg-s and an energy requirement of 260. 9 kJ/mol. ...|$|R

Literally, thousands (2, 850) of simulations were carried out to the periodic state to study the effects of the light product purge to feed ratio ({gamma}), cycle step time (t{sub s}) or cycle time (t{sub c}), high to low pressure ratio ({pi}{sub T}), and heavy product recycle ratio (R{sub R}) on the process performance, while changing the cycle configuration from 4 - to 5 -step (bed) designs utilizing combinations of light and heavy reflux steps, two different depressurization modes, and two sets of CO{sub 2 }-HTlc mass transfer coefficients. The process performance was judged in terms of the CO{sub 2 } purity and recovery, and the feed throughput. The best process performance was obtained from a 5 -step (bed) stripping PSA cycle with a light reflux step and a heavy reflux step (with the heavy reflux gas obtained from the low <b>pressure</b> <b>purge</b> step), with a CO{sub 2 } purity of 78. 9 %, a CO{sub 2 } recovery of 57. 4 %, and a throughput of 11. 5 L STP/hr/kg.

The necessity of energy economy and preventing losses is an important issue in study of flares.

In this paper having concentrated on cost factors of flares such as height, diameter, horizontal distance to nearest tower, wind velocity, gas temperature, civil and erection costs, the optimum point of flare designing is obtained through using genetic algorithm toolbox. Intermediate crossover function was used while applying GA. Optimization was repeated 50 times by different initial conditions and the average of output data is presented as ultimate one.

Surface modification is needed to improve the interfacial conductivity. In this study, Ti-Ag film is prepared on TA 1 titanium as bipolar plates for URFC by pulsed bias arc ion plating (PBAIP). Interfacial conductivity of Ti-Ag/Ti is improved obviously, presenting an interfacial contact resistance of 4. 3 m Omega cm(2) under 1. 4 MPa.

40|$|The general {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the separation, with microfluidics, of the components of a ternary mixture, when using vacuum or purge gas pervaporation. The ternary mixture considered is a mixture of methanol (MeOH), water (H 2 O) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). In a previous work (Ziemecka in Lab Chip 15 : 504 – 511, 2015), we presented the proof of concept of a microfluidic device, which was able to partially separate MeOH from the other components of such a mixture, by using vacuum pervaporation. Here, our goal is to optimize the operation of this device, by considering vacuum pervaporation, but also purge gas pervaporation. First, we provide a mathematical model of the device. This model is used to discuss the influence of the operating parameters on the device operation. To apply this model to the considered mixture, we determined the MeOH and H 2 O permeability coefficients of PDMS membranes prepared from different concentrations of the curing agent. The model is then successfully compared to experimental data. The model and the experiments show that high efficiencies can be reached for both vacuum and purge gas pervaporation, provided a fine-tuning of the operating parameters.

40|$|A new {{filtration}} method using rotating micro-engineered membranes (microsieves) is described. The method uses constant {{rotation of}} the microsieve in combination with high-frequency flow reversal to achieve stable and high fluxes. The high-frequency flow reversal is enabled by a vacuum device placed at the retentate side creating a local negative <b>pressure</b> to <b>purge</b> the microsieve from accumulating particles. The method was validated for milk filtration using microsieves with 0. 9 μm circular pores with a trans-membrane pressure (TMP) of 0. 05 - 0. 30 bar and flow-reversal frequencies between 5 and 25 Hz. Stable filtration (for at least 4 h) was achieved with permeate fluxes for skimmed milk from 8 to 50 m 3 h - 1 m - 2 at room temperature, and for whole milk from 7 to 13 m 3 h - 1 m - 2 at 50 °C. The effect of the TMP, rotation frequency and flow-reversal strength on the flux was investigated. The flux increased proportional with the TMP up to a critical TMP of about 250 mbar. Also the flux increased with rotation frequency up to an optimal frequency of 20 Hz. The flow-reversal unit requires a threshold backward flow to create enough negative pressure to overcome the TMP during the removal cycle of the retentate particles. Above this threshold the flux increases strongly with increasing backward flow. The novel high-frequency flow-reversal method enables continuous milk filtration of large volumes during many hours without the need of a chemical cleaning cycle. </p...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{plasma etching}} in silicon is {{often based on}} the {{so-called}} ‘Bosch’ etch with alternating half-cycles of a directional Si-etch and a fluorocarbon polymer passivation, respectively. Also shallow feature etching is often performed as a cycled process. Similarly, ALD is cyclic with the additional benefit of being composed of half-reactions that are self-limiting, thus enabling a layer-by-layer growth mode. To accelerate growth rate, spatial ALD has been commercialized as a large-scale, high-throughput, atmospheric-pressure method. In this paper we describe a related concept for high-rate spatially-divided etching which eventually may be further developed towards Atomic Layer Etching. The process is converted from the time-separated into the spatially-separated regime by inserting N 2 -gas ‘curtains’ confining the reactive gases to individual injection slots in a gas injector head, and also serving as gas-bearing. By moving substrates back and forth under such gas injector one can perform alternate etching/passivation-deposition cycles at optimized local pressures, thus eliminating the idle times for switching <b>pressure</b> or <b>purging.</b> An extra improvement towards an all-spatial approach {{is the use of}} ALD-based oxide (Al 2 O 3, SiO 2, etc.) as passivation during, or as gap-fill after etching.

40|$|The {{goal of the}} Collaborative Cross (CC) {{project was}} to {{generate}} and distribute hundreds of independent recombinant inbred strains derived from eight inbred parents. Although the project assumed a modest degree of extinction, {{it soon became clear}} that extinction was much more prevalent in this multi-parent population. With breeding to homozygosity completed, we can now estimate the extinction rate at remarkable 95 % despite considerable efforts to maintain lines with poor reproductive performance. Thus, extinction in the CC represents a unique opportunity to investigate factors that contribute to infertility, often difficult to study because of fitness <b>pressure</b> to <b>purge</b> them from a population. Here we provide the first report of a large and logistically challenging collaboration to systematically phenotype and genotype males from the last generation of CC lines when there were deemed extinct due lack of productivity. We analyzed fertility and a large number of reproductive phenotypes on the last unproductive males from 347 independent CC funnels and performed a trait mapping with the largest number of CC lines to date. Extinction in the CC may be due largely to male infertility, since 47 % of males from extinct funnels were infertile. CC extinct fertile and infertile males had similar means and ranges for nearly every reproductive trait measured, suggesting that a single trait is unlikely to explain the observed infertility. We performed QTL mapping across 39 male reproductive traits and identified 9 genomic regions significantly associated with features such as reproductive organ size and sperm motility traits. To demonstrate the effectiveness of trait mapping in the population, we validated a QTL for sperm velocity in an independent population and confirmed the observed allelic effect in multiple generations. Additionally, we identified a large region on chromosome X for genetic infertility driven by the PWK/PhJ haplotype, indicating that genetic incompatibility between founders might also cause CC strain extinction. The results from this study will help us understand genetic factors associated with mammalian infertility, and will also shed light onto reproductive concerns and problems with current breeding of extant CC strain...|$|R

He reviewed the forces still available to prevent or repel any attempted invasion, summing up the review as follows:I have thought it right upon this occasion to give the House and the country some indication of the solid, practical grounds upon which we base our inflexible resolve to continue the war, and I can assure them that our professional advisers of the three Services unitedly advise that we should do so, and that there are good and reasonable hopes of final victory. He reported messages of support from the Dominions and justified confidence in victory, even if it was not yet clear how that victory could be achieved.In casting up this dread balance-sheet, contemplating our dangers with a disillusioned eye, I see great reason for intense vigilance and exertion, but none whatever for panic or despair. During the first four years of the last war the Allies experienced,...nothing but disaster and disappointment, and yet at the end their morale was higher than that of the Germans, who had moved from one aggressive triumph to another. During that war we repeatedly asked ourselves the question, [...] "How are we going to win?" [...] and no one was able ever to answer it with much precision, until at the end, quite suddenly, quite unexpectedly, our terrible foe collapsed before us.The peroration - quoted below - even at a moment of great apparent danger to British national survival talks not only of national survival and national interest, but of noble causes (freedom, Christian civilisation, the rights of small nations) for which Britain was fighting and for which Churchill thought the United States should - and given time would - fight.|$|R

This {{control system}} adopts Siemens S 7 - 400 PLC to realize these {{functions}} of monitoring ambi-room pressure by the vacuum gauges and manipulating all vacuum valves {{in real time}} etc. The ambi-room control system belonged to unworthy man guard equipments has severe control request of "absolute safety", so that it must ensure safety and credibility in every operation flow: vacuum achievement, input dry clean air, keeping ambi-room <b>pressure,</b> dynamic state <b>purge</b> air sweeping etc. So safety design and manufacture is preferential to any other request, furthermore this idea passes through all control workflow. Because the user mutual interface is very friendly, the manipulation is simple and easy to learn for all assigned operators. Background The final optics assemblies (FOAs) are the last element of the main laser system and {{the first of the}} target area systems. Each FOA contains one integrated optics modules (IOM) that incorporate beam conditioning, frequency conversion, focusing, diagnostic sampling, and debris shielding capabilities into a single compact assembly. These optics are shown in the Fig. 1. The same mechanical, optical, and beam control components that are used in the FOA at the target chamber are reproduced for a single beamline in the precision diagnostic system. Then, the ambi-room mus...|$|R
40|$|Lithium {{metazirconate}} (Li{sub 2 }ZrO{sub 3 }) is {{a promising}} tritium breeder material for fusion reactors {{because of its}} excellent tritium release characteristics. In particular, for water-cooled breeding blankets (e. g., ITER), Li{sub 2 }ZrO{sub 3 } is appealing from a design perspective because of its good tritium release at low operating temperatures. The steady-state and transient tritium release/retention database for Li{sub 2 }ZrO{sub 3 } is reviewed, along with conventional diffusion and first-order surface resorption models which {{have been used to}} match the database. A first-order surface resorption model is recommended in the current work both for best-estimate and conservative (i. e., inventory upper-bound) predictions. Model parameters we determined and validated for both types of predictions, although emphasis is placed on conservative design predictions. The effects on tritium retention of ceramic microstructure, protium partial <b>pressure</b> in the <b>purge</b> gas and purge gas flow rate are discussed, along with other mechanisms for tritium retention which may not be dominant in the experiments, but may be important in blanket design analyses. The proposed tritium retention/release model can be incorporated into a transient thermal performance code to enable whole-blanket predictions of tritium retention/release during cyclic reactor operation. Parameters for the ITER driver breeding blanket are used to generate a numerical set of model predictions for steady-state operation...|$|R
40|$|The NASA Glenn Research Center has {{constructed}} a closed-cycle hydrogen-oxygen PEM {{regenerative fuel cell}} (RFC) to explore its potential use as an energy storage device for a high altitude solar electric aircraft. Built up over the last 2 years from specialized hardware and off the shelf components the Glenn RFC is a complete "brassboard" energy storage system which includes all the equipment required to (1) absorb electrical power from an outside source and store it as pressurized hydrogen and oxygen and (2) make electrical power from the stored gases, saving the product water for re-use during the next cycle. It consists of a dedicated hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell stack and an electrolyzer stack, the interconnecting plumbing and valves, cooling pumps, water transfer pumps, gas recirculation pumps, phase separators, storage tanks for oxygen (O 2) and hydrogen (H 2), heat exchangers, isolation valves, <b>pressure</b> regulators, nitrogen <b>purge</b> provisions, instrumentation, and other components. It specific developmental functions include: (1) Test fuel cells and fuel cell components under repeated closed-cycle operation (nothing escapes; everything is used over and over again). (2) Simulate diurnal charge-discharge cycles (3) Observe long-term system performance and identify degradation and loss mechanisms. (4) Develop safe and convenient operation and control strategies leading to the successful development of mission-capable, flight-weight RFC's...|$|R
40|$|Selected metal−organic {{frameworks}} exhibiting representative properties—high surface area, structural flexibility, or {{the presence}} of open metal cation sites—were tested for utility in the separation of CO 2 from H 2 via pressure swing adsorption. Single-component CO 2 and H 2 adsorption isotherms were measured at 313 K and pressures up to 40 bar for Zn 4 O(BTB) 2 (MOF- 177, BTB 3 − = 1, 3, 5 -benzenetribenzoate), Be 12 (OH) 12 (BTB) 4 (Be-BTB), Co(BDP) (BDP 2 − = 1, 4 -benzenedipyrazolate), H 3 [(Cu 4 Cl) 3 (BTTri) 8] (Cu-BTTri, BTTri 3 − = 1, 3, 5 -benzenetristriazolate), and Mg 2 (dobdc) (dobdc 4 − = 1, 4 -dioxido- 2, 5 -benzenedicarboxylate). Ideal adsorbed solution theory was used to estimate realistic isotherms for the 80 : 20 and 60 : 40 H 2 /CO 2 gas mixtures relevant to H 2 purification and precombustion CO 2 capture, respectively. In the former case, the results afford CO 2 /H 2 selectivities between 2 and 860 and mixed-gas working capacities, assuming a 1 bar <b>purge</b> <b>pressure,</b> as high as 8. 6 mol/kg and 7. 4 mol/L. In particular, metal−organic frameworks with {{a high concentration of}} exposed metal cation sites, Mg 2 (dobdc) and Cu-BTTri, offer significant improvements over commonly used adsorbents, indicating the promise of such materials for applications in CO 2 /H 2 separations...|$|R
5000|$|The {{museum was}} founded in 1952 and was first {{open to the public}} in the former Shanghai Racecourse club house, now at 325 West Nanjing Road. The museum's {{founding}} collections came principally from three sources: a batch of artefacts gathered by the Communist 3rd Field Army during the civil war from accidental finds and confiscations of private property and brought to Shanghai upon the Communists' conquest of the city; artefacts confiscated by the customs service; items sold by private collectors due to political <b>pressure</b> during political <b>purges</b> and purchased by the government. The former Shanghai Municipal Museum was also merged into the new Shanghai Museum. In the next few years, the museum's collections were further enriched from other private and institutional collections in Shanghai, including the collection of the former Shanghai Museum of the Royal Asiatic Society, which were moved to the museum as [...] "foreign" [...] institutions gradually left the city in the 1950s. In 1959 the museum moved into the Zhonghui Building at 16 South Henan Road, which previously housed insurance companies and bank offices. During the metal-gathering campaign of the Great Leap Forward, The Shanghai Museum participated in rescuing bronzeware from metal that had been confiscated or donated and were sent to be melted down. Before the Cultural Revolution, a tradition formed whereby Shanghai's wealthy collectors would make annual donations to the museum.|$|R
40|$|Biogas {{consisting}} {{mainly of}} methane {{and carbon dioxide}} can be utilized as renewable energy source in {{combined heat and power}} plant, vehicle fuel, or substitute for natural gas after upgrading process. In this work, biogas upgrading with pressure swing adsorption is studied with dynamic process simulation method using the modified Skarstrom cycle, which gives the variation of the pressure and stream concentration with cycle time in the column, while the variation of these variables with cycle time are difficult to be observed by experiments. Thus the simulation results would supply more dynamic information of the process. The pressure swing adsorption performance of the novel adsorbent metal-organic framework 508 b is simulated and compared with the processes using traditional adsorbents such as zeolite 13 X and carbon molecular sieve 3 K. A two-column six-step pressure swing adsorption simulation model involving parametric sensitivity analysis is established. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm models of the three adsorbents are built by fitting experiment data. The energy consumption of the pressure swing adsorption process with different adsorbents is calculated by fixing a 98 % purity and 85 % recovery ratio of methane product after investigating the key parameters, i. e., adsorption pressure, desorption <b>pressure</b> and <b>purge</b> to feed ratio. Simulation results reveal that the order of the energy consumption in the process is zeolite 13 X > carbon molecular sieve 3 K> metal-organic framework 508 b. For metal-organic framework 508 b has linear carbon dioxide isotherm compared with zeolite 13 X, which makes the desorption of the carbon dioxide easier, and its adsorption capacity is higher than with carbon molecular sieve 3 K under the same partial pressure. In conclusion, the energy consumption of pressure swing adsorption process using metal-organic framework 508 b adsorbent is 56 % lower than that using zeolite 13 X, and the column packed with metal-organic framework 508 b is estimated to be 13 % smaller in diameter than that with zeolite 13 X. The simulation results can help to provide guidelines for development of new adsorbents to meet higher product purity and recovery ratio along with lower process energy consumption.
