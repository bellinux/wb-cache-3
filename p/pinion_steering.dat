5|$|BMW {{began to}} use precise rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> systems in the 1930s, and many other European {{manufacturers}} soon adopted the technology. American automakers adopted rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> beginning with the 1974 Ford Pinto.|$|E
5|$|Offered with an inline-4 {{engine and}} bucket seats the Pinto's {{mechanical}} design was conventional, with unibody construction, a {{longitudinally mounted engine}} in front driving the rear wheels through either a manual or automatic transmission and live axle rear end. Suspension was by unequal-length control arms with front coil springs; the live rear axle was suspended on leaf springs. The rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> had optional power assist, as did the brakes.|$|E
25|$|V8 models use {{recirculating}} ball steering (as per previous 5 Series generations), however rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> {{was used for}} the first time, in the four-cylinder and six-cylinder models. Unlike its E34 predecessor and E60 successor, the E39 was not available with all-wheel drive.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In general, the {{strength}} of gears is calculated using the formula of AGMA or JGMA. But these formula can not be applied directly to {{the strength}} calculation of the rack and <b>pinion</b> of <b>steering</b> gear assay, because of complex tooth and contact shapes. So Lewis bending stress and Hertzian contact stress formula are generally used {{for the design of}} rack and <b>pinion</b> of <b>steering</b> gear assay. But these formula do not also give the exact stress of rack and pinion. In this paper, comparing the finite element analysis results and the experimentally measured values, it is shown that the finite element modeling technique of the rack and <b>pinion</b> of <b>steering</b> assay is reasonable.

5000|$|Fully {{hydraulic}} (no direct mechanical {{connection between}} the steering wheel shaft and the <b>steering</b> <b>pinion</b> during normal operation).|$|R
25|$|Unusually, two {{different}} steering systems {{were used for}} the E39, depending on the engine. Models with four-cylinder and six-cylinder models use rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>steering,</b> the first time this system has been used in a 5 Series. This system steers {{from the front of the}} axle. Models with V8 engines use recirculating ball steering, as per the previous generations of 5 Series.|$|E
25|$|In late 1962 Alan Turner, AC's chief {{engineer}} completed a major design {{change of the}} car's front end to accommodate rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> while still using transverse leaf spring suspension. The new car entered production in early 1963 and was designated Mark II. The steering rack was borrowed from the MGB while the new steering column came from the VW Beetle. About 528 Mark II Cobras were produced {{in the summer of}} 1965 (the last US-bound Mark II was produced in November 1964).|$|E
25|$|The Pacer {{has been}} {{described}} as one of the formerly unloved cars from the 1970s that are enjoying a resurgence in both collectibility and auto restoration—especially among fans of cars from that era. The Pacer is one of several 1970s cars that were always thought of as cheap vehicles; therefore they were poorly maintained, which reduced their life expectancy. Also the heavy engines used in the car put more load on the front suspension than intended, which caused the rack & <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> to fail frequently on Pacers built in 1975.|$|E
50|$|The B6 S4 came {{equipped}} with electronically controlled, variable assisted 'servotronic' rack and <b>pinion</b> power assisted <b>steering</b> (PAS) as standard.|$|R
50|$|Lightweight {{rack and}} <b>pinion</b> with {{adjustable}} <b>steering</b> column and lightweight 10 inch {{leather-covered steering wheel}} was used. Steering arms were connected to the rack by adjustable rod-ends.|$|R
50|$|All C4 S4s' came {{equipped}} {{as standard}} with a conventional fixed-assistance rack and <b>pinion</b> power assisted <b>steering</b> (PAS) system. An electronically controlled 'servotronic' system, which varied {{the level of}} assistance {{in accordance with the}} road speed, was available as an option.|$|R
25|$|The XH series Falcon {{utility and}} van, {{released}} in 1996, were essentially XG models facelifted {{to resemble the}} contemporary Falcon EF sedans and wagons. The XH also gained an all-new front suspension and rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> from the EA–EL series cars. This meant changes to the frame and bodywork, from the firewall forward. The turret (roof) panel on the utility was now domed and lost its squared-off appearance, increasing interior head room. By this time, {{the popularity of the}} panel van had faded and Ford released their final Falcon panel van in 1997 as part of the revised XH II series. It was also with this model that the V8 engine was re-introduced into the Falcon utility commercial vehicle range. After 20 years, the fourth generation Falcon was discontinued in June 1999.|$|E
25|$|The EL {{brought with}} it {{improvements}} to braking and handling. Speed-sensitive power steering on the Fairmont Ghia made parking more straightforward, without compromising high-speed steering. With {{the introduction of the}} new model, buyers could now purchase a Falcon with standard (optional on GLi) anti-lock brakes featuring the latest Bosch 5.3 module. Perhaps the biggest advancement with the EL was the improvements to the handling woes of the EF, with improvements established to the suspension and steering. Engineers at Tickford had discovered that by lowering the pivot point of the Watt's linkages in the rear suspension by 20millimetres (0.8in), that the roll oversteer effect which plagued the EF could finally be eliminated. Previously on EF models, during hard cornering the rear end of the car often felt as if it could not keep up with the front, due to the difference in roll rate between the front and rear suspension. The result of this produced unpredictable car handling at times, where the delayed weight transfer at the rear would seek to damage the integrity of the outside rear tyre grip. This was exaggerated even further in wet weather or on vehicles fitted with poor tyres. Although this problem was addressed to a degree in the EFII update, it was the EL that became the first base level Falcon to feature a rear suspension setup that would complement the precision of rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> introduced in the EA Falcon eight years earlier. The improved suspension geometry allowed Ford to soften the spring rates on both front and rear on the EL for a more compliant ride, as the driver no longer had roll oversteer to contain.|$|E
500|$|The Ford Pinto is a front-engine, {{rear-drive}} subcompact car manufactured {{and marketed}} by Ford Motor Company for model years 1971–1980. [...] The first subcompact developed by Ford in North America, the Pinto was marketed in two-door coupe (1971–1972), three-door hatchback (1971–1980), and three-door station wagon (1972–1980) body styles, {{and was the}} first mass-produced American car with rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>steering.</b>|$|E
50|$|The front {{suspension}} is {{a sophisticated}} clean sheet, double wishbone layout {{that is also}} cleverly symmetrical from left to right, thus reducing spares inventories, etc. Both {{the front and rear}} suspension oscillations are dampened by adjustable bump and rebound shock absorbers fitted with adjustable spring platforms.The rack and <b>pinion</b> power <b>steering</b> assembly is mounted ahead of the engine in order to better optimise the front suspension geometry and the high loads generated under long distance racing events.|$|R

There, {{he worked as a}} suspension engineer on vehicles such as the rear wheel drive Toyota Mark II, Crown, Soarer, and Aristo, along with the front wheel drive Toyota Corona, Corolla, and Celica. In December 1982 Tanahashi filed for his first U.S. patent, regarding the [...] "upper support structure for front wheel suspension of automobile", which was granted in 1984.

2500|$|The Autobianchi Primula is a {{supermini}} {{economy car}} manufactured between 1964 and 1970 by the Italian automaker Autobianchi, a now defunct {{subsidiary of the}} Fiat Group. The Primula was Fiat's first model with rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> and is widely known for its innovative Dante Giacosa-designed front-wheel drive, transverse engine layout [...] that would be later popularized by the Fiat 128 to ultimately become an industry-standard front drive layout.|$|E
2500|$|Hydraulically-assisted (electric for North American market) {{rack and}} <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> gives for a [...] turning circle. Braking-wise, {{ventilated}} front, and solid rear disc brakes are employed, both using piston steel calipers. To counteract noise, vibration, and harshness, engineers have designed the Cruze with an isolated four-point engine mount and implemented sound damping material in areas including the front-of-dashboard panel, luggage compartment, decklid internals, doors, carpet and headlining. Further noise suppression {{through the use}} of a triple-layer sealing system in the doors has also been employed.|$|E
2500|$|The Audi V8 came {{equipped}} with rack and <b>pinion</b> power assisted <b>steering</b> (PAS) as standard. An electronically controlled variable assisted 'servotronic' version was also available. It was {{fitted with a}} high-performance brake system, which included radially ventilated disc brakes front and rear. [...] The fronts were rather unusual – designed by Continental AG and sized at [...] in diameter by [...] thick, but the caliper was mounted inside the disc. The fronts also incorporated electronic brake pad wear sensors. [...] The rears were [...] by , and incorporated a cable-operated parking brake. [...] A Bosch anti-lock braking system (ABS) was also standard.|$|R
5000|$|The double {{planetary}} gear system incorporates an input sun gear connected to the driver’s steering wheel, two {{planetary gear}}s, an output sun gear connected to the <b>steering</b> <b>pinion,</b> and a rotating housing. If the housing is held still, the driver’s steer inputs are translated from the input sun gear, thought the planetary gears (sharing a common lay shaft) to the output sun gear with a net 1:1 ratio. I.e. if the planetary gear housing is held still, conventional steering operation is retained. This characteristic provides a means of steering the vehicle {{in the event of}} an active steering system failure.|$|R
50|$|The {{planetary}} gear housing features external gear teeth {{and can be}} rotated by a motor and worm gear. Alteration of the housing position allows rotation of the output sun gear independently of the input sun gear position. I.e. if the driver were to hold the steering wheel (and therefore the input sun gear) stationary, driving the {{planetary gear}} housing {{will result in the}} rotation of the <b>steering</b> <b>pinion</b> (and therefore a steering action at the front wheels). By manipulating the position of the planetary gear housing, the active steering ECU can synthesize a variable steering ratio or generate steering actions independently of the driver.|$|R
2500|$|Volkswagen added a [...] "Super Beetle" [...] (the Type 131) to its lineup in 1971. The Type 131 {{differed}} from the standard Beetle in its use of a MacPherson strut front suspension {{instead of the usual}} torsion bars. The Super Beetle featured a new hooded, padded dash and curved windshield (from 1973 model year on up). Rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> replaced recirculating ball steering gears in model year 1974 and up. The front of the car was stretched [...] to allow the spare tire to lie flat, and the combination of these two features increased the usable front luggage space.|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, [...] "Expert Series" [...] {{sets were}} introduced, geared towards older, more {{experienced}} Lego builders {{followed by the}} [...] "Expert Builder" [...] sets in 1977.

In 1978 the Lego [...] "minifigure" [...] was added. These small Lego people have posable arms and legs, and a smile. The figure was used in many varieties of Lego sets, allowing construction of towns populated with the smiling minifigure Lego citizens. Lego also expanded into space {{with the creation of}} Lego Space sets with astronaut minifigures, rockets, lunar rovers and spaceships and in medieval territory with the Castle theme.|$|E
2500|$|The 1948 car {{featured}} radial tyres, {{which had}} just been commercialised; front-wheel drive; rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> mounted inside the front suspension cross-tube, away from a frontal impact; rear fender skirts (the suspension design allowed wheel changes without removing the skirts); bolt-on detachable front and rear wings; detachable doors, bonnet (and boot lid after 1960), by [...] "slide out" [...] P-profile sheet metal hinges; flap-up windows, as roll up windows were considered too heavy and expensive.; and detachable full length fabric sunroof and boot lid, for almost pickup-like load-carrying versatility. Ventilation {{in addition to the}} sunroof and front flap windows was provided by an opening flap under the windscreen. The car had load adjustable headlights and a heater (heaters were standardised on British economy cars in the 1960s).|$|E
40|$|AbstractAmong the {{techniques}} used in surface finish machining of gears, the honing {{process has been}} highlighted due to high efficiency in the finishing of hardened gears and ease of adjusting the involutes profile and incident angle in the counter-part. The gear honing process is used to eliminate errors that appears after the heat treatment on the tooth surface and. Although the material and cutting speed of the tool {{are similar to the}} grinding process, honing the process simulates true cinematic movement of the mesh gear, which provides a better surface roughness compared to the Hobbing process. Consequently, it is hard to correct anomalies in the gear teeth. This process has been used to improve the mechanisḿs hydraulic <b>steering</b> <b>pinion</b> / rack system. For the experiments, it were compared two processes, namely honing and hard Hobbing in order to assess the adequate strength in the direction of clockwise rotation and counter clockwise, which represents the actual effort exerted by the driver of the vehicle. The honing process was lead using a 400 Fassler HMX machine tool. In order to assess the significant difference between the experiments, it was used ANOVA and Tukey test. The results obtained from the experiments using the honing process were satisfactory as compared the results obtained from hard hobbing process. Thus, it can be concluded that this process provides an excellent surface finish of the sprockets having a direct impact on the returned vehicle steering syste...|$|R
40|$|By-wire" {{systems are}} {{characterized}} {{by the lack of}} mechanical link between the control device and the actuator, being it hydraulic or mechanical. The connection is replaced by a mechatronic system, equipped with redundant sensors and actuators [1]. SBW consists in two electro-mechanical actuators that steer the vehicle wheels and generate a resistance torque against the rotation of the steering wheel during cornering maneuvers. Each actuator is characterized by the presence of an electric motor, the first is connected to the <b>pinion</b> of the <b>steering</b> system, the other is connected to the steering wheel. The electric motor connected to the pinion is controlled in position and the command signal is generated by a PID controller. Reference position depends only on steering wheel angle and steering ratio. The torque control of the second electric motor is more difficult; the reference torque value has to be realistic in order to grant the proper feeling to the driver. The steering column is removed, as well as every hydraulic component {{that is part of the}} classic servo-assisted steering system. The logic that controls the system needs the information provided by two position sensors: one encoder is devoted to measure the steering wheel angular position, one linear position transducer measures the position of the rack [2]. The connection between the control units of the two sub-systems is realized through a communication bus. The aim of SBW technology is to completely remove as many mechanical components (steering shaft, column, gear reduction mechanism, etc.) as possible, thus simplifying the car interior design, increasing the driver safety in case of frontal crash. Moreover, active safety and handling are increased thanks to the variable ratio between steering wheel angle and tyres' steering angle, determined by a control logic [3]. SbW system's steering wheel has to generate a resistant torque which adds to the friction one. Such torque must be felt as natural by the average driver and carry information about vehicle dynamic condition. The paper describes the design of a SBW prototype, obtained from a classical steering system (see Fig. 13) [4] [5]. A Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) test bench is also described: it is realized in order to test feedback torque generation and steering wheel efficiency influence on vehicle behavior. Actual steering wheel angle is used as input for a ten degrees of freedom model that calculates the vehicle dynamics, defining the steered wheels motion and the resistance torque at the pinion (see Fig. 10). An analog signal is generated in order to control the steering wheel electric motor torque. Experimental tests are performed to optimize the feedback torque control. The reference torque is then calculated only using signals coming from vehicle on board sensors. Control logic is finally improved in order to stiffen the steering system unnaturally when lateral acceleration is about to reach adherence limit and prevent further steering action (see Fig. 14...|$|R
2500|$|Popular Science, in a four-car road test, {{considered}} the Premier {{one of the}} sportiest sedans (by measure of road holding and drive precision) available on the American market.

2500|$|Inspired by styling {{from the}} Dakar and Jeepster concept vehicles, the Liberty was {{intended}} as a replacement for the discontinued Jeep Cherokee. The Liberty also marked a few firsts for Jeep. It was the first Jeep vehicle to use rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>steering.</b> It's also the first Jeep to use the two then-new PowerTech engines; the [...] 2.4 L straight-4, which was discontinued in 2006, and the [...] 3.7 L V6, as well as a 2.8 L VM Motori turbo diesel (2005-2006 only) for the CRD versions. [...] However, the Liberty was not the first Jeep vehicle to use an independent front suspension, as the Jeep Wagoneer first used it in the 1963 model. But, that independent front suspension was limited to four wheel drive versions and, even then, was a short lived option. In addition, the Liberty was nominated for the North American Truck of the Year award for 2002.|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson dislikes the British car brand Rover, {{the last}} major British owned and built car manufacturer. This view {{stretched}} back to the company's time as part of British Leyland. Describing {{the history of the}} company up to its last flagship model, the Rover 75, he paraphrased Winston Churchill and stated [...] "Never in the field of human endeavour has so much been done, so badly, by so many," [...] citing issues with the rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> system. In the latter years of the company Clarkson blamed the [...] "uncool" [...] brand image as being more of a hindrance to sales than any faults with the cars.

2500|$|The {{production}} car changed little from the prototype, although the full-width rear bumper was dropped {{in favour of}} two part-bumpers curving round each corner, with overriders. Mechanicals were basically stock Herald with the notable addition of front disc brakes. The engine was an [...] four-cylinder with a pushrod OHV cylinder head and two valves per cylinder, mildly tuned for the Spitfire, fed by twin SU carburettors. Also from the Herald came the rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> and coil-and-wishbone front suspension, and at the rear a single transverse-leaf swing axle arrangement. This ended up being the most controversial part of the car: it was known to [...] "tuck in" [...] and cause violent over steer if pushed too hard, even in the staid Herald. In the sportier Spitfire (and later the six-cylinder Triumph GT6 and Triumph Vitesse) it led to severe criticism. Known fixes for this include things like camber compensators (essentially a single leaf spring suspended beneath the vertical links), or simply achieving more negative camber to the rear wheels can help the handling become more manageable. The body was bolted to a much-modified Herald chassis, the outer rails and the rear outriggers having been removed; little of the original Herald chassis design was left, and the Spitfire used structural outer sills to stiffen its body tub.|$|E
2500|$|While the SA22/FB was a purer sports car, the FC tended {{toward the}} softer sport-tourer trends of its day, sharing some {{similarities}} with the HB series Cosmo. Handling was much improved, with {{less of the}} oversteer tendencies of the FB. The rear end design was vastly improved from the FB's live rear axle to a more modern, Independent Rear Suspension (rear axle). Steering was more precise, with rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> replacing the old recirculating ball steering of the FB. Disc brakes also became standard, with some models (S4: Sport, GXL, GTU, Turbo II, Convertible; S5: GXL, GTUs, Turbo, Convertible) offering four-piston front brakes. The rear seats were optional in some models of the FC RX-7, but are not commonly found in the American Market. Mazda also introduced Dynamic Tracking Suspension System (DTSS) in the 2nd generation RX-7. The revised independent rear suspension incorporated special toe control hubs which were capable of introducing a limited degree of passive rear steering under cornering loads. The DTSS worked by allowing a slight amount of toe-out under normal driving conditions but induced slight toe-in under heavier cornering loads at around 0.5 Gs or more; toe-out in the rear allows for a more responsive rotation of the rear, but toe-in allowed for a more stable rear under heavier cornering. [...] Mazda also introduced Auto Adjusting Suspension (AAS) in the 2nd generation RX-7. The system changed damping characteristics according to the road and driving conditions. [...] The system compensated for camber changes and provided anti-dive and anti-squat effects.|$|E
