40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to review the {{performance}} of plate bonded flexurally strengthened reinforced concrete beams. This paper also describes the methods and materials used for flexural and shear strengthening of reinforced concrete beams and weaknesses of plate bonded systems. The plate bonding method often has some serious <b>premature</b> debonding <b>failure</b> which can be classified as plate end debonding (end peeling), tension delamination and <b>premature</b> shear <b>failure</b> due to insufficient shear reinforcement. <b>Premature</b> <b>failures</b> must be prevented in order to utilize the full flexural capacity of flexural strengthened reinforced concrete beams. <b>Premature</b> shear <b>failure</b> {{is one of the major}} concerns of the flexurally strengthened reinforced concrete (RC) beams. Hence, proper design of external shear strengthening system is required for eliminating <b>premature</b> shear <b>failure</b> of flexurally strengthened RC beams. The review focuses on the possible model and design guideline available in the literature for eliminating <b>premature</b> <b>failures.</b> The paper also discusses a probable approach to eliminate premature shear...|$|R
50|$|Mutation in the FIGLA gene are {{associated}} with <b>premature</b> ovarian <b>failure.</b> <b>Premature</b> ovarian <b>failure</b> is a genetic disorder that leads to hypergonadotropic ovarian failure and infertility. It is believed that <b>premature</b> ovarian <b>failure</b> in humans is caused by FIGLA haploninsuffciency, which disrupts {{the formation of the}} primordial follicles. This was observed in FIGLA mice knockouts which had diminished follicular endowment and accelerated oocyte loss throughout their reproductive life span. Women with mutations in their FIGLA were shown to have a form of <b>premature</b> ovarian <b>failure.</b> As well as the failure to form primordial follicles, knockout mice also lacked zona pellucida genes Zp1, Zp2, and ZP3 expression.|$|R

25|$|The use of {{de-icing}} salts on roadways, used {{to lower the}} freezing point of water, {{is probably one of}} the primary causes of <b>premature</b> <b>failure</b> of reinforced or prestressed concrete bridge decks, roadways, and parking garages. The use of epoxy-coated reinforcing bars and the application of cathodic protection has mitigated this problem to some extent. Also FRP (fiber-reinforced polymer) rebars are known to be less susceptible to chlorides. Properly designed concrete mixtures that have been allowed to cure properly are effectively impervious to the effects of de-icers.|$|E
25|$|Most modern solid-carbide bits {{should not}} be used in {{conjunction}} with a spot drill bit or a center drill bit, as solid-carbide bits are specifically designed to start their own hole. Usually, spot drilling will cause <b>premature</b> <b>failure</b> of the solid-carbide bit and a certain loss of hole quality. If it is deemed necessary to chamfer a hole with a spot or center drill bit when a solid-carbide drill bit is used, it is best practice to do so after the hole is drilled.|$|E
25|$|While {{the above}} {{is a common}} use of center drill bits, it is a {{technically}} incorrect practice {{and should not be}} considered for production use. The correct tool to start a traditionally drilled hole (a hole drilled by a high-speed steel (HSS) twist drill bit) is a spotting drill bit (or a spot drill bit, as they are referenced in the U.S.). The included angle of the spotting drill bit should be the same as, or greater than, the conventional drill bit so that the drill bit will then start without undue stress on the bit's corners, which would cause <b>premature</b> <b>failure</b> of the bit and a loss of hole quality.|$|E

40|$|Indoor {{corrosion}} {{failures of}} aluminum-finned copper-tube evaporator coils, {{and also in}} some systems without aluminum fins, is a menacing issue in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) industry. Extensive laboratory testing has verified {{the development of a}} reproducible screening method to assess suspected contaminants of producing <b>premature</b> <b>failures</b> of copper tube resulting from a very localized form of corrosion known as “formicary corrosion ” [a/k/a “ant nest corrosion”]. This paper provides a historical perspective on formicary corrosion and various mechanisms. BACKGROUND Indoor corrosion failures of aluminum-finned copper-tube evaporator coils, sometimes without aluminum fins, is a menacing issue in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) industry. Of note, significantly from Japanese research, is the conclusion that approximately 10 % of all <b>premature</b> <b>failures</b> of copper tube result from a very localized form of corrosion known as formicary or “ant nest” corrosion. Based on this fact alone, the HVAC industry worldwide has recognized that formicary corrosion, albeit not identified as such in most instances, accounts for many <b>premature</b> <b>failures</b> in copper products. Some geographic areas within the United States have experienced higher incidences o...|$|R
25|$|Auto-gating is {{a feature}} {{found in many}} image {{intensifier}} tubes manufactured for military purposes after 2006, though it {{has been around for}} some time. Autogated tubes gate the image intensifier within so as to control the amount of light that gets through to the microchannel plate. The gating occurs at high frequency and by varying the duty cycle to maintain a constant current draw from the microchannel plate, it is possible to operate the tube during brighter conditions, such as daylight, without damaging the tube or leading to <b>premature</b> <b>failure.</b> Auto-gating of image intensifiers is militarily valuable as it allowed extended operational hours giving enhanced vision during twilight hours while providing better support for soldiers who encounter rapidly changing lighting conditions, such as those assaulting a building.|$|E
25|$|Accelerated {{low-water}} corrosion (ALWC) is {{a particularly}} aggressive form of MIC that affects steel piles in seawater near the low water tide mark. It is characterized by an orange sludge, which smells of hydrogen sulfide when treated with acid. Corrosion rates can be very high and design corrosion allowances can soon be exceeded leading to <b>premature</b> <b>failure</b> of the steel pile. Piles that have been coated and have cathodic protection installed {{at the time of}} construction are not susceptible to ALWC. For unprotected piles, sacrificial anodes can be installed locally to the affected areas to inhibit the corrosion or a complete retrofitted sacrificial anode system can be installed. Affected areas can also be treated using cathodic protection, using either sacrificial anodes or applying current to an inert anode to produce a calcareous deposit, which will help shield the metal from further attack.|$|E
25|$|The {{heart was}} a major prize for {{transplant}} surgeons. But over and above rejection issues, the heart deteriorates within minutes of death, so any operation {{would have to be}} performed at great speed. The development of the heart-lung machine was also needed. Lung pioneer James Hardy attempted a human heart transplant in 1964, but when a <b>premature</b> <b>failure</b> of comatose Boyd Rush's heart caught Hardy with no human donor, he used a chimpanzee heart, which beat in his patient's chest for approximately one hour and then failed. The first success was achieved on 3 December 1967, by Christiaan Barnard in Cape Town, South Africa. Louis Washkansky, the recipient, survived for eighteen days amid what many saw as a distasteful publicity circus. The media interest prompted a spate of heart transplants. Over a hundred were performed in 1968–1969, but almost all the people died within 60 days. Barnard's second patient, Philip Blaiberg, lived for 19 months.|$|E

40|$|Rolling {{bearings}} {{are commonly}} used element of machines. The most common things that cut bearings life are: poor fitting, poor lubrication, contamination and fatigue. Poor fitting usually called as brute force causes lifetime reduction about in 16 % of <b>premature</b> <b>failures.</b> Also {{the availability of the}} correct fitting tools is the cause for poor fitting. Individual installations may require mechanical, hydraulic or heat application methods for correct and efficient mounting or dismounting. Poor lubrication also is one of the causes although bearings are mostly ‘sealed–for–life’ and that’s why are installed and stay forgotten. About 36 % of <b>premature</b> bearing <b>failures</b> are caused by incorrect specification and inadequate application of the lubricant. Effective lubrication and use of recommended greases by bearing manufacturers can significantly reduce downtime. Contamination can easily spoil lubricant and that leads to poor lubrication and deterioration of precision part of bearing. The proper isolation from contaminants is needed. About 14 % of all <b>premature</b> bearing <b>failures</b> are attributed to contamination problems. Fatigue is one more important thing in bearing operation. Incorrect operation, overload or negligence can be cause of about 34 % of premature bearing faults. The condition monitoring together with preventive measures can reduce <b>premature</b> <b>failures</b> and downtime...|$|R

As of 2013, single-packaged devices with capacities of 1TB are readily available, and devices with 16GB capacity are very economical. Storage capacities in this range have traditionally been considered to offer adequate space, because they allow enough space for both the operating system software and some free space for the user's data.|$|E
2500|$|Long also {{suspected}} that Titanics breakup {{may have begun}} with the <b>premature</b> <b>failure</b> of the ship's after expansion joint, and ultimately exacerbated {{the loss of life}} by causing Titanic to sink faster than anticipated. In 2006, the History Channel sponsored dives on Titanics younger sister ship, , which verified that the design of Britannics expansion joints was superior to that incorporated in the Titanic. To further explore Long's theory, the History Channel commissioned a new computer simulation by JMS Engineering. The simulation, whose results were featured in the 2007 documentary Titanic's Achilles Heel, partially refuted Long's suspicions by demonstrating that Titanics expansion joints were strong enough to deal with any and all stresses the ship could reasonably be expected to encounter in service and, during the sinking, actually outperformed their design specifications. But, most important is that the expansion joints were part of the superstructure, which was situated above the strength deck (B-deck) and therefore above the top of the structural hull girder. Thus, the expansion joints had no meaning for the support of the hull. [...] They played no role in the breaking of the hull. [...] They simply opened up and parted as the hull flexed or broke beneath them.|$|E
