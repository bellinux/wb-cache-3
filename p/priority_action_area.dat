It is now government policy ‘to ensure that all Manitoba’s children and youth have access to an array of educational opportunities such that every learner experiences success through relevant, engaging and high quality education that prepares them for lifelong learning and citizenship in a democratic, socially just and sustainable society’. This statement is included in the mission of the provincial Ministry of Education and Advanced Learning. In response to this policy commitment, ESD has been integrated into the curriculum from kindergarten up to 12th grade with specific learning outcomes identified in science, social studies, health and physical education. Building the capacity of educators and school leaders, as well as dedicated funding to ensure the development of sustainability practices, principles, programmes and partnerships, helps schools to embed sustainability into their classrooms, operations and management.|$|E
40|$|In an {{era when}} {{nutritional}} factors are increasingly accepted as having {{a significant impact on}} the health of the nation, and “evidence-based practice ” is core rhetoric in the health sector, ongoing investment in nutrition monitoring in Australia has become even more critical for those working in the field of public health nutrition. That is, determining and reporting on trends in the food and nutrition situation for the overall population and for priority subgroups. Why do we need this? Eat Well Australia describes objectives of nutrition monitoring as providing appropriate data for: ● policy development ● coordination and review ● program planning and evaluation ● reporting against national goals and targets ● reporting internationally. More informally, monitoring data and reports also provide a focus for bringing people together to address issues (in a way that can move beyond personalities and politics). Development of nutrition monitoring has been a stated national priority for the last decade, being one of four priority objectives of Australia’s National Food and Nutrition Policy (launched in 1992) and a <b>priority</b> <b>action</b> <b>area</b> in Eat Well Australia (EWA, endorsed in 2000).

40|$|The {{number of}} Internet users as {{percentage}} of population varies significantly across transition countries. While some transition countries post penetration rates that exceed {{the performance of}} Western European laggards, most lag well behind Western European performance. Take-up growth is very rapid {{in a number of}} countries but, as the base is very low, convergence, if any, is likely to take some time. Broadly similar stylized facts emerge from a review of the spread of Internet hosts and number of PCs per 100, 000 inhabitants. The paper examines empirically the key economic, social and institutional determinants of Internet usage in transition countries, along the lines of a recent study by Wallstein for the telecom sector 1, and the potential convergence in take-up rates between EU countries and transition countries, and draws major policy lessons for transition countries. In a first part of the study, 3 ̆b 1 convergence, absolute 3 ̆b 2 convergence and relative 3 ̆b 2 convergence in Internet take-up rates (defined as either the estimated number of users or the number of domain hosts) in EU countries and transition countries will be examined to determine whether a new digital curtain is likely to arise in Europe and stimulate appropriate policy responses. The approach builds on the large empirical economic growth literature and the lessons learnt from this work, but focuses exclusively on the Internet take-up rates. In the second part, in addition to taking account of typical explanatory variables such as income, education, price, etc the study focuses on the general state of transition {{and the nature of the}} Telecom regulatory regime, and competition in the telecom sector (using the telecommunications transition indicators published annually by the EBRD), the state of the Internet supply and the state of the telecom infrastructure and more general policy variables (openness to foreign influences, economic and political freedom, etc.) The purpose of focusing on these additional variables is to identify potential areas for priority action by policy-makers.

40|$|Most of the 1, 314 {{responses}} were received by mail. Many were typed, or in computer files. More than half were eloquent hand-written texts with some, in good Spore reader tradition, extending to several pages. More than 400 photos, intricate illustrations and sketches, engraved poems and digital diagrams accompanied them {{it is tempting}} to publish them all in an album. The fact that email and the World Wide Web were used by 14, 6 % of respondents merits attention. To those concerned about the Digital Divide, it gives some reassurance that computer-mediated communication, such as the Internet, is growing. Yet many more respondents, 31 % to be exact, claim to use email now and 10 % expect to use it by the end of 2002. It is, though, not yet part of their daily pattern of communication, at least for responding to Spore surveys. Most actually share the email address of a neighbour, colleague or friend, often on one of the free systems provided by Internet companies. This confirms the observation that Internet penetration in developing countries should not be measured by the number of email subscriptions since each one actually means perhaps ten other people. Who s talking? The language used by respondents reflects, in broad terms, the circulation of the English and French editions of Spore, and the Portuguese Esporo. Just over 54 % of {{responses were}} in English, 37 % in French and 8 % in Portuguese. Gender issues The number of women responding to the survey does not fully reflect their place in the ranks of CTA s distribution of Spore, which itself is far from a proper reflection of the place of women in ACP agriculture. This is a <b>priority</b> <b>action</b> <b>area</b> for CTA. In all, 84 women (6. 4 %) responded, nearly all by mail, whereas women account for 11 % of the mailing list. More than half hold positions where they make sure their Spore is put to wide use: in libraries, information centres and education, and leadership positions in some civil society groups. Where are you from? Of the six ACP regions, the most populous, West Africa, provided the most responses: 548, or 42 %. Here, Nigeria, followed by Benin and Togo, takes the lion s share. The large population, and widespread distribution, in Nigeria combine in a readership level of almost six people in 10, 000, above the average. Another lion s share is taken by Ethiopia, with a readership level of 5. 1 / 10, 000, due in part to widespread distribution amongst extension workers and Spore being one of the few English language publications available. Each country can take pride, or note, of the number of responses it returned, each with its special reasons. Some regions, such as the Caribbean, or sub-regions, are relatively well-catered for in agricultural publications. Other countries, such as South Africa or Zimbabwe, have emerging agricultural sectors which have yet to express their demand in full. The full picture of responses by country is shown in the large Table 1. How many are you? We estimate that there are at least 1, 089, 200 readers of Spore. Well over one million. This does not include the people who read articles taken from Spore and published in another newspaper, magazine or Website, or broadcast on radio or TV. We call those people secondary readers, and we cannot begin to calculate them. Primary readers are the people who touch their Spore (or someone else s), take it from a library shelf, receive a photocopy within their organisation, read it in a village centre, study it in their office, or listen to the words and study the pictures whilst it is read out in the hundreds of readers groups of which so many respondents have written to us. How do we calculate our readership? One survey question was how many people read your Spore? : for example, 149 respondents said that 5 people do, and 137 said that 50 or more do. We took all these replies; we excluded the clear errors and removed the fantastic (17, 000; 15, 000); we checked for evidence (many readers explained their own sums); and we rounded off. When someone wrote 5 we put 5, and about 10 or more than 10 became 11, because we added 10 %. In all, 1, 241 respondents answered this question (73 did not). The total number of readers for those 1, 241 was 33, 786. On average this means 27. 23 readers per copy. We multiplied this average by the estimated number of copies of Spore which are read each issue: 40, 000. And 40, 000 times 27. 23 = 1, 089, 200. And the 40, 000 copies? Well, at the time of our analysis, the Spore mailing list had 11, 703 institutions and 21, 442 individuals. Of these 33, 145 copies, most go to subscribers in ACP countries (30, 713). Others go to paying subscribers, some complimentary copies go to partner organisations, our correspondents in ACP countries, and the mass media. The delegations of the European Union in ACP countries, who operate their own mailing lists, receive 4, 200 copies. To this total of 37, 345, we added the 2, 750 copies which are distributed at seminars, study visits, fairs and conferences. We then rounded the total down to 40, 000. In addition, the World Wide Web editions have a growing readership. In June 2002, the Spore pages were being read by 14, 640 visitors each two months (the frequency of Spore). When you study Table 1, remember that what matters most is not the actual total, but how many copies of Spore are available to, amongst others, rural people in a country. All in all, Table 1 has enough data to make a great many calculations. We invite you to send us your ideas on how to expand Spore s outreach. Most of the 1, 314 responses were received by mail.

The project manager actively sought to engage with the key wound management leaders and advanced clinicians to gain their support and views on the priority education and training issues. The response to all data collection methods was pleasing with almost five hundred responses to the general wound workforce online survey. The data supported {{the need for more}} wound management education and training and identified some particular topics of need, such as utilising wound investigations and understanding wound products, pharmaceuticals and devices.

40|$|Introduction: The {{climate of}} reform and change {{is evident in the}} current Australian health care system where {{significant}} challenges are faced due to a growing burden of chronic disease, an aging population, workforce issues, and unacceptable inequities in access to services and health outcomes. Improved management of chronic conditions and a focus on health promotion and prevention are key <b>priority</b> <b>action</b> <b>areas.</b> It is vital that the health workforce has the appropriate knowledge and skills to work in a holistic approach that allows them to contribute to the downstream, midstream, upstream actions that will be required to address the future challenges. This presentation describes workforce health promotion capacity building initiatives developed in Northern Australia. Methods and Materials: A range of courses have been developed to build workforce capacity including a 5 -day Core Health Promotion Short Course and tertiary level courses including a postgraduate certificate, postgraduate diploma and Master of Public Health (Health Promotion). Results: Between 2007 and 2011, fourteen 5 day short courses in health promotion were conducted for 254 participants. Follow up impact evaluation shows that the courses succeed in providing knowledge, skills, confidence and enthusiasm to undertake health promotion work but that a lack of understanding of health promotion from co-workers and managers, lack of organisational support and commitment, lack of resources, competing clinical priorities, and lack of time were barriers for undertaking health postgraduate courses commenced in 2010. Conclusions: There is strong support for workforce development in health promotion in north Queensland. Short courses and tertiary level training are one way to achieve this. However shifting health service delivery to a more upstream approach to address chronic disease requires broader capacity building within health services and systems including leadership, partnerships, resource allocation and organisational development...|$|R
40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} {{cause the}} suffering of {{hundreds of millions of}} people, especially in tropical and subtropical areas. Effective, affordable and easy-to-use medicines to fight these diseases are nearly absent. Although science and technology are sufficiently advanced to provide the necessary medicines, very few new drugs are being developed. However, drug discovery is not the major bottleneck. Today's R&D-based pharmaceutical industry is reluctant to invest in the development of drugs to treat the major diseases of the poor, because return on investment cannot be guaranteed. With national and international politics supporting a free market-based world order, financial opportunities rather than global health needs guide the direction of new drug development. Can we accept that the dearth of effective drugs for diseases that mainly affect the poor is simply the sad but inevitable consequence of a global market economy? Or is it a massive public health failure, and a failure to direct economic development for the benefit of society? An urgent reorientation of priorities in drug development and health policy is needed. The pharmaceutical industry must contribute to this effort, but national and international policies need to direct the global economy to address the true health needs of society. This requires political will, a strong commitment to prioritize health considerations over economic interests, and the enforcement of regulations and other mechanisms to stimulate essential drug development. New and creative strategies involving both the public and the private sector are needed to ensure that affordable medicines for today's neglected diseases are developed. <b>Priority</b> <b>action</b> <b>areas</b> include advocating an essential medicines R&D agenda, capacity-building in and technology transfer to developing countries, elaborating an adapted legal and regulatory framework, prioritizing funding for essential drug development and securing availability, accessibility, distribution and rational use of these drugs...|$|R

A study was conducted to explore differences in HRQoL (including perceived stigma) between CHB and CHC participants. As expected, CHB participants scored substantially lower on perceived stigma. However, {{there was no difference in}} HRQoL between the two groups, indicating that other factors must impact negatively on people with CHB. The current research aims to reduce unrecognized and untreated cases of CHB. Two priority populations and several <b>priority</b> <b>action</b> <b>areas</b> in the First National Hepatitis B Strategy are being addressed. Migrant populations from endemic areas represent the majority of people with CHB in Australia. Studies in the U. S. show that Hmong people are worse affected than most. Therefore, the Hmong community living in Cairns area (Far North Queensland) will likely benefit from -and has expressed interest in participating in this research. Routine antenatal screening offers great opportunities for increasing awareness about CHB, especially in people at increased risk. However, follow-up care for women who test positive during pregnancy is often neglected, partly due to a lack of CHB knowledge and awareness in primary health care providers. Phase 1 of this project aims to assess current hepatitis B awareness and antenatal practice in order to identify gaps and barriers. This includes CHB-related information currently provided to pregnant women; barriers preventing health-seeking behaviours; and to what extent and through whom contact tracing (screening/immunization/monitoring) occurs. Considering that the majority of people with CHB were infected at birth or during early childhood, it is important to not only trace household contacts but also parents and siblings living elsewhere. The objectives for Phase 1 are to survey local GPs, a high risk population (using psychosocial constructs based on behavioural theory), and new/expectant mothers from the general population, and to make comparisons where appropriate. The results will form the basis for the development and evaluation of suitable interventions in Phase 11. This presentation will cover the work that has been done so far...|$|R

40|$|Riparian {{zones are}} central {{landscape}} features providing several ecosystem services and are exceptionally rich in biodiversity. Despite their relatively low area coverage, riparian zones consequently represent {{a major concern}} for land and water resource managers confirmed within several European directives. These directives involve effective multi-scale monitoring to assess their conditions {{and their ability to}} carry out their functions. The objective of this research was to develop automated tools to provide from a single aerial LiDAR dataset new mapping tools and keystone riparian zone attributes assessing the ecological integrity of the riparian zone at a network scale (24 km reach). Different metrics were extracted from the original LiDAR point cloud, notably the Digital Terrain Model and Canopy Height Model rasters, allowing the extraction of riparian zones attributes such as the wetted channel (0. 89 m; mean residual) and floodplain extents (6. 02 m; mean residual). Different riparian forest characteristics were directly extracted from these layers (patch extent, overhanging character, longitudinal continuity, relative water level, mean and relative standard deviation of tree height). Within the riparian forest, the coniferous stands were distinguished from deciduous and isolated trees, with high accuracy (87. 3 %, Kappa Index). Going further the mapping of the indicators, our study proposed an original approach to study the riparian zone attributes within different buffer width, from local scale (50 m long channel axis reach) to a network scale (ca 2 km long reaches), using a disaggregation/re-agraggation process. This novel approach, combined to graphical presentations of the results allow natural resource managers to visualise the variation of upstream-downstream attributes and to identify <b>priority</b> <b>action</b> <b>areas.</b> In the case study, results showed a general decrease of the riparian forests when the river crosses built-up areas.

40|$|Municipal Public Health Planning in Queensland: achievements, {{barriers}} and implementation success factors. ABSTRACT Creating healthier and more sustainable cities requires {{new approaches to}} planning at the local level. Queensland Health, Local Governments and Griffith University have formed a working partnership to implement Municipal Public Health Planning (MPHP) in local government. Each city has its own culture and diversity, its own political and organisational barriers to planning, and changing health professional capacity. The Queensland Healthy City and Shires Network facilitates partnerships, research, training and learning environments with local government and community agencies that are developing and implementing participatory planning. Healthy cities and shires meet and compare their planning achievements. Regional and town planning schemes provide consistency for major infrastructure and land development, and local government legislation now requires cities to determine social health needs. MPHP is identified as one of several community public health planning models trialled in this research. A practical 'seven step' MPHP process provides the framework for healthy cites needs based planning. This paper discusses {{the importance of a}} 'platform approach', where government and non-government agencies and community groups form a network and engage in the business of sustainable strategic health planning. The platform approach has 3 dimensions, Governance (long-term vision, layers of planning, industry support and regulation); a Platform (mechanism for agency networking, stakeholder forum, advisory committee, terms of reference, project management); and Implementation (local strategies and <b>priority</b> <b>action</b> <b>areas,</b> desired outcomes, communication process and evaluation). The research findings highlight the importance of the 'platform approach'. An Implementation Model has been developed to promote the actioning of strategies in community planning. In the model health strategies 'link up' vertically to higher levels of planning, and 'link across' horizontally to address gaps in agency planning, community group concerns and resident needs. The paper will describe the research developed in evaluation of MPHP, including a summary of the qualitative evaluation methodology, results and findings of the study and a 'Platform Approach' to participatory planning and MPHP Implementation Model. Key Words: healthy cities, municipal public health planning, partnerships, qualitative evaluation and strategic planning, health promotion implementation.

According to this entrance, these municipal districts "will focus on <b>priority</b> <b>actions</b> to protect <b>areas</b> threatened with degradation and rationalization of land use in order to prevent, monitor and control illegal deforestation" (Arco Verde Operation). The images {{used in this study}} were obtained by aircraft remote sensing, R 99 -B, operating in the L and X bands, HH, VV, VH and HV, with a spatial resolution of 6 m, with 8 bits and 8 looks. The Brazilian Air Force was responsible for imaging and the CENSIPAM was responsible for data processing and analysis of deforestation of the images obtained by the sensor Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) of SIPAM. The analysis in this study showed the importance of using images R 99 /SAR indispensable for a more precise quantification of deforestation in the Amazon. Pages: 2997 - 300...|$|R
40|$|Implementation of a {{long term}} action plan to manage and protect well fields is a complex and very {{expensive}} process. In this context, the relevance and efficiency of such action plans on water quality should be evaluated. The objective {{of this study is}} to set up a methodology to identify relevant actions zones in which environmental changes may significantly impact the quantity or quality of pumped water. In the Seine-et-Marne department (France), under French environmental laws three sectors integrating numerous well-field pumping in Champigny's limestone aquifer are considered as priority. This aquifer, located at south-east of Paris, supplies more than one million people with drinking water. Catchments areas of these abstractions are very large (2000 km 2) and their intrinsic vulnerability was established by a simple parametric approach that does not permit to consider the complexity of hydrosystem. Consequently, a methodology based on a distributed modeling of the process of the aquifer was developed. The basin is modeled using the hydrogeological model MODCOU, developed in MINES ParisTech since the 1980 s. It simulates surface and groundwater flow in aquifer systems and allows to represent the local characteristics of the hydrosystem (aquifers communicating by leakage, rivers infiltration, supply from sinkholes and locally perched or dewatering aquifers). The model was calibrated by matching simulated river discharge hydrographs and piezometric heads with observed ones since the 1970 s. Thanks to this modelling tool, a methodology based on the transfer of a theoretical tracer through the hydrosystem from the ground surface to the outlets was implemented to evaluate the spatial distribution of the contribution areas at contrasted, wet or dry recharge periods. The results show that the surface of areas contributing to supply most catchments is lower than 300 km 2 and the major contributory zones are located along rivers. This finding illustrates the importance of rivers seepage for groundwater recharge. In parallel, validation of the modelled hydrodynamic system was reinforced by implementing nitrogenous contamination simulations. This pollution is linked to intensive farming activities practised on the basin since the early 70 's. This modelling was realized by coupling the hydrological model MODCOU and the agronomic model STICS allowing to generate the spatio-temporal evolution of sub-root nitrogen fluxes stemming from intensive farming. The evolution of nitrate concentrations observed and simulated in groundwater confirms the strong reactivity of the Champigny's aquifer to nitrogen fluxes entering the system. For the contributory zones, the calculated transfer time between these areas and catchments shows very short transfer times in stream infiltration sectors (less than 2 years), and longer transfer times (up to 10 years) from layers partially occupied by an upper aquifer existing in the overlying formation of Brie's limestones. The relationship between the main recharge areas and transfer times, between these areas and a specific well field, allows to determine relevant <b>priority</b> <b>action</b> <b>areas.</b> <b>Action</b> plans of such protected areas should be applied to manage long term changes represented by an evolution of the polluting fluxes that result from land use change or evolution in the recharge conditions of hydrosystem...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dramatic inequalities {{dominate}} {{global health}} today. The rapid urban growth sustained by Kenya {{in the last}} decades has created many difficulties that also led to worsening inequalities in health care. The continuous decline in its Human Development Index since the 1990 s highlights the hardship that continues to worsen in the country, against the general trend of Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper examines the health status of residents in a major urban centre in Kenya and reviews the effects of selected social determinants on local health. Methods: Through field surveys, focus group discussions and a literature review, this study canvasses past and current initiatives and recommends <b>priority</b> <b>actions.</b> Results: <b>Areas</b> identified which unevenly affect {{the health of the}} most vulnerable segments of the population were: water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, food environments, housing, the organization of health care services and transportation. Conclusion: The use of a participatory method proved to be a useful approach that could benefit other urban centres in their analysis of social determinants of health. Background Dramatic inequalities dominate global health today, where the conditions in which people grow, live, work and age have a powerful influence on their health [1]. Evi-dence suggests that this is particularly true in cities- where half of the world's population currently live- and that the urban setting is a social determinant of health in itself [2]. Indeed, living in cities increases exposure to unhealthy environments, disasters, climate change, violence and injuries, tobacco and other drugs, and epidemics [2]. ally [3]. The country has seen slow but continuous decrease in its Human Development Index {{since the beginning of the}} 1990 s, in contrast even to the slowly ris-ing average of Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. Very large gaps in well-being and life chances continue to exist in Kenya, which is 148 th out of 177 countries ranked [4]...|$|R
