40|$|The {{appearance}} of the contemporary suburb {{is one of its}} most criticized and problematic features. Architects find themselves challenged by its increasing size and complicated planning issues. These challenges are compounded because traditional methods of control do not specifically confront these issues. A less comprehensive method of control, design codes, has recently emerged to address some of the limitations associated with traditional forms of control. This thesis is a survey of five design codes used in contemporary suburbs. Specific focus is given to examining the organization and objectives of design codes, and what architectural elements are regulated. The survey suggests that the most noticeable features of design codes is that they are specific to a <b>project</b> and <b>site,</b> <b>address</b> unique objectives of a particular community, and specifically address suburban design problems. This underlines the essential role design codes have in reshaping and ultimately improving the diminished {{appearance of}} the contemporary suburb...|$|R

40|$|A {{multitude}} of organisations with varying material needs are often involved in activities at <b>project</b> <b>sites.</b> This makes {{the use of}} collective project resources, like material handling resources at <b>project</b> <b>sites,</b> demanding. However, to ensure project success {{it is important that}} material flows needed to support activities undertaken at <b>project</b> <b>sites</b> are not disrupted as this can result in unnecessary costs and low customer service. The {{purpose of this paper is}} therefore to analyse how material flows to and from <b>project</b> <b>sites</b> can be coordinated and how project characteristics might impact on how this is done. To do this, empirical data from a primarily qualitative case study undertaken at a Swedish exhibition centre used for multiple fairs has been collected. Findings illustrate how significant improvements can be achieved in the management of material flows to and from <b>project</b> <b>sites</b> if the material handling needs of the project participants are known in advance and the utilization of critical logistical resources is planned accordingly. The coordination of material flows for fairs are, however, impeded by fair characteristics like short project duration, heterogeneous material flows and fair diversity. Further research on coordination of material flows to and from <b>project</b> <b>sites</b> is suggested as the logistical problems observed in the studied case are likely to exist at other <b>project</b> <b>sites</b> with restricted access as well...|$|R

40|$|Pioneering {{methods in}} recent optical lattice {{experiments}} allow to focus laser beams {{down to a}} spot size that {{is comparable to the}} lattice constant. Inspired by this achievement, we examine the resonance fluorescence spectra of two-level atoms positioned in adjacent lattice sites and compare the case where the laser hits only one atom (single <b>site</b> <b>addressing)</b> with cases where several atoms are illuminated. In contrast to the case where the laser hits several atoms, the spectrum for single <b>site</b> <b>addressing</b> is no longer symmetric around the laser frequency. The shape of the spectrum of fluorescent light can therefore serve as a test for single <b>site</b> <b>addressing.</b> The effects we find can be attributed to a dipole-dipole interaction between the atoms due to mutual exchange of photons.

40|$|This project {{reveals the}} {{potential}} for new connections and an enhanced sense of place identity to serve as catalysts for the revitalization of the derelict urban environment. Gateway Park in Gary, Indiana was chosen for the <b>project</b> <b>site</b> and has been redesigned and expanded in order {{to bridge the gap}} between downtown Gary and the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Particular attention has been paid to connecting the <b>project</b> <b>site</b> to proposed regional greenway systems while illustrating the natural and cultural heritage of Gary. Additionally, the <b>project</b> <b>site</b> has been designed to fit within the framework of Northwest Indiana's Marquette Plan and transit-oriented development vision, while incorporating diverse programming to attract a wide variety of site users. The final design proposal rests on a historiography of the <b>project</b> <b>site,</b> a literature review investigating place identity and 'placemaking,' a study of relevant precedent projects, and extensive inventory, analysis, and concept development.
