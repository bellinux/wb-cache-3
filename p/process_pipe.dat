50|$|A {{pipefitter}} is a tradesperson who installs, assembles, fabricates, maintains {{and repairs}} mechanical piping systems. Pipefitters usually begin as helpers or apprentices. Journeyman pipefitters deal with industrial/commercial/marine piping and heating/cooling systems. Typical industrial <b>process</b> <b>pipe</b> is under high pressure, which requires metals such as carbon steel, stainless steel, and many different alloy metals fused together through precise cutting, threading, grooving (Victaulic), bending and welding. A plumber concentrates on lower pressure piping systems for sewage and potable water (tap water), in the industrial, commercial, institutional, or residential atmosphere. Utility piping typically consists of copper, PVC, CPVC, polyethylene, and galvanized pipe, which is typically glued, soldered, or threaded. Other types of piping systems include steam, ventilation, hydraulics, chemicals, fuel, and oil.|$|E
50|$|Pipes are {{commonly}} joined by welding, using threaded pipe and fittings; sealing {{the connection with}} a pipe thread compound, Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) Thread seal tape, oakum, or PTFE string, or by using a mechanical coupling. Process piping is usually joined by welding using a TIG or MIG process. The most common <b>process</b> <b>pipe</b> joint is the butt weld. The ends of pipe to be welded must have a certain weld preparation called an End Weld Prep (EWP) which is typically at an angle of 37.5 degrees to accommodate the filler weld metal. The most common pipe thread in North America is the National Pipe Thread (NPT) or the Dryseal (NPTF) version. Other pipe threads include the British standard pipe thread (BSPT), the garden hose thread (GHT), and the fire hose coupling (NST).|$|E

These lines, being manufactured and installed by industry, will connect the cold boxes of the 4. 5 -K refrigerators and the 1. 8 -K refrigeration units to the cryogenic interconnection boxes. The lines have a maximum of 30 -m length and may possess either small or large re-distribution units to allow connection to the interface ports. Due to space restrictions the lines may have complex routings and require several elbowed sections. The lines consist of a vacuum jacket, a thermal shield and either three or four helium <b>process</b> <b>pipes.</b> Specific internal and external supporting and compensation systems were designed for each line to allow for thermal contraction of the <b>process</b> <b>pipes</b> (or vacuum jacket, {{in case of a}} break in the insulation vacuum) and to minimise the forces applied to the interface equipment.

5000|$|To be {{representative}} of the average temperature of fluid, the thermowell must extend a few per cent of the inside diameter of the <b>process</b> <b>pipe</b> or vessel (Normally 1/3 rd of the pipe inside diameter). A rule of thumb that is sufficient for most industrial applications (approximately 1% accuracy) is to ensure that the thermowell projects 5 times its own diameter into the process plus the length of its sensing element. So, for a grounded thermocouple spring-loaded into a thermowell with a 1-inch-diameter shank and a tip thickness of [...]25 inch, a typical immersion length would equal 5.5 inches (1 inch OD x 5 + [...]25 inch well tip thickness +.25 inch sensor wall thickness = 5.5 inches). A thermowell is typically machined from solid bar stock and gun-drilled to ensure a long straight bore that closely approximates the diameter of the installed sensor (ex: a [...]260-inch bore matching a [...]250-inch sensor). A thermowell is typically mounted into the process stream by way of a threaded, welded, sanitary cap or flanged process connection. The temperature sensor such as a thermometer, thermocouple or resistance temperature detector is inserted in the open end of the thermowell and typically spring-loaded to ensure that the outside tip of the temperature sensor is in metal to metal contact with the inside tip of the thermowell.|$|E

Firstly, the meter provides the {{volumetric flow rate}} of the mixture by measuring {{the speed at which}} naturally occurring turbulent structures convect with the flow past an axial array of sensors wrapped around existing <b>process</b> <b>pipe.</b> Secondly, the meter utilizes similar sonar-based processing techniques and the naturally occurring acoustical propagation in the <b>process</b> <b>pipe</b> to measure sound speed and hence the entrained air levels in slurries and fluids.

40|$|The Deposit Removal Project was {{undertaken}} {{with the support}} of the U. S. Department of Energy at the East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP) formerly the Oak Ridge K- 25 Site. The project team performed the safe removal of the hydrated uranyl fluoride (UO{sub 2 }F{sub 2 }) deposits from the K- 29 Building of the former Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant. The deposits had developed as a result of air leakage into UF{sub 6 } gas process pipes; UO{sub 2 }F{sub 2 } became hydrated by moisture from the air and deposited inside the pipes. The mass, its distribution, and the hydrogen content [that is, the ratio of H to U (H/U) ], were the key parameters that controlled the nuclear criticality safety of the deposits. Earlier gamma-ray spectrometry measurements in K- 29 had identified the largest deposits in the building. The first and third largest deposits in the building were measured in this program. The first deposit, found in the Unit 2, Cell 7, B-Line Outlet <b>process</b> <b>pipe</b> (called the ''Hockey Stick'') was about 1, 300 kg ({+-} 50 % uncertainty) at 3. 34 wt% {sup 235 }U enrichment ({+-} 50 % uncertainty) and according to the gamma-ray spectroscopy was uniformly distributed. The second deposit (the third-largest deposit in the building), found in the Unit 2, Cell 6, A-Line Outlet <b>process</b> <b>pipe</b> (called the ''Tee-Pipe''), had a uranium deposit estimated to be about 240 kg ({+-} 50 % uncertainty) at 3. 4 wt % {sup 235 }U enrichment ({+-} 20 % uncertainty). Before deposit removal activities began, the Deposit Removal Project team needed to survey the inside of the pipes intrusively to assess the nuclear criticality safety of the deposits. Therefore, the spatial distribution of the deposits, the total uranium deposit mass, and the moderation level resulting from hydration of the deposits, all of which affect nuclear criticality safety were required.
