5|$|In 1986, Sessional Paper Number 1 was {{published}} by the Government of Kenya, outlining the country's need for economic development and growth. The document stressed the government opinion that the airline {{would be better off}} privately owned, thus resulting in the first privatisation attempt. The government named Philip Ndegwa as Chairman of the Board in 1991, with specific orders to make the airline a privately owned company. In 1992, the <b>Public</b> <b>Enterprise</b> Reform paper {{was published}}, giving Kenya Airways priority among national companies in Kenya to be privatised. Ndegwa was succeeded by Isaac Omolo Okero. In , Brian Davies, was appointed as the new managing director of the company. Davies had been previously hired to carry out a study of viability on privatisation, working for British Airways' Speedwing consulting arm. Swissair was the first company to provide Kenya Airways with privatisation advice. In the fiscal year 1993 to 1994, the airline produced its first profit since the start of commercialisation. In 1994, the International Finance Corporation was appointed to provide assistance in the privatisation process, which effectively began in 1995. A large aviation industry partner was sought to acquire 40% of the shares, with another 40% reserved for private investors and the government keeping the remaining stake. The government would absorb almost million in debts and would convert another million it provided in loans into equity; after reorganisation, the company would have a debt of approximate million. British Airways, KLM, Lufthansa and South African Airways were among the airlines expressing interest in taking a stake in Kenya Airways.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the debates}} {{surrounding}} the United States federal budget center around competing macroeconomic schools of thought. In general, Democrats favor the principles of Keynesian economics to encourage economic growth via a mixed economy of both private and <b>public</b> <b>enterprise,</b> a welfare state, and strong regulatory oversight. Conversely, Republicans generally support applying the principles of either laissez-faire or supply-side economics to grow the economy via small government, low taxes, limited regulation, and free enterprise. Debates have surrounded the appropriate size and role {{of the federal government}} since the founding of the country. These debates also deal with questions of morality, income equality, and intergenerational equity. For example, Congress adding to the debt today may or may not enhance {{the quality of life for}} future generations, who must also bear the additional interest and taxation burden.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{strengthening}} of democratic governance institutions {{is a key}} factor for any development initiative. With these institutions in place, accountability becomes a yardstick to achieve greater results. This article therefore set out to explore the impact that decentralisation has on <b>Public</b> <b>Enterprises.</b> Decentralisation being an instrument of good governance, the article want to investigate if it applicability on state own enterprises could stimulate economic development. A policy of decentralisation could be considered as an important tool for economic development if the process is adequately implemented. <b>Public</b> <b>enterprises</b> {{were put in place}} in many countries to contribute to social development. However, past studies have shown that, <b>public</b> <b>enterprises</b> have not performed well over the past fifty year or so. Many failed because of lack of transparency and accountability. The central question around the thesis is why these <b>public</b> <b>enterprises</b> did not achieve the required results for which they created and what is needed for corrective actions. The article concludes by proposing that, In order to ensure sustainability and economic expediency, {{it is important to consider}} decentralisation as a condition for <b>public</b> <b>enterprises</b> to achieve developmental results. The paper is divided into five major parts: The first part introduces the topic, the second part argues about the rationale of decentralisation for the sustainability of <b>public</b> <b>enterprises...</b>|$|R

Brain maintained that its negative financial performance in its early years was a necessary by-product of rapid expansion to establish itself as a significant force in the market. In June 1950, he was able to report its first profit. [...] This, plus popular opinion in TAA's favour, helped ensure the airline's survival as a <b>public</b> <b>enterprise</b> {{in the wake of the}} Labor government's loss to Robert Menzies' conservative Liberal Party in the Federal election the previous year, though Coles was replaced as Chairman of ACAC by Norman Watt.
