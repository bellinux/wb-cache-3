25|$|World War II precipitated great {{changes in}} the economy of Massachusetts, which in turn led to changes in society. The {{aftermath}} of WWII created a global economy that was focused upon {{the interests of the}} United States, both militarily and in relation to business. The domestic economy in the United States was altered by government <b>procurement</b> <b>policies</b> focused on defense. In the years following WWII, Massachusetts was transformed from a factory-based economy to one based on services and technology. During WWII, the U.S. government had built facilities that they leased, and in the post-war years sold, to defense contractors. Such facilities contributed to an economy focused on creating specialized defense goods. That form of economy prospered {{as a result of the}} Cold War, the Vietnam War, and the Korean War.|$|E

Major recommendations are: Transition from minicomputer to microcomputer system; Transition to proven commercial office system; Use local area network technology; Acquire mass storage capability; Acquire improved graphics capability; Consider automating ship [...] shore communications, and start to develop a <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> to support the acquisition of the above technologyNaval Sea Systems Command FedDocs Washington, D.

In this article, the use {{by the government of}} the preferential <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> to deliver low-cost housing is discussed. In addition, the way in which this practice exacerbates the existing housing backlog is explored. The article contends that the Provincial Departments of Local Government and Housing in South Africa are largely incompetent when it comes to implementing the preferential <b>procurement</b> <b>policy.</b> Consequently, the question of how the implementation of this policy could be improved is considered. In the process, the difficulties encountered in implementing the preferential <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> in conjunction with the low-cost housing programme are examined...|$|R

The paper concludes by discussing some recent actions, trends, and issues from the U. S defense procurement sector in terms of the framework. Models such as the one proposed in this paper will contribute to enhanced approaches to <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> analysis by scholars, as well as to informed and sophisticated policy implementation by practitioners...|$|R
25|$|In 1958, Eagle {{acquired}} {{the first three}} of an eventual six Douglas DC-6s for long-range charter and scheduled operations. These were the airline's first pressurised aircraft. They were also its first imported aircraft (the initial batch of three had been sourced from the US). This acquisition marked an important change regarding UK airlines' aircraft <b>procurement</b> <b>policies</b> as new legislation permitted (for the first time) that aircraft imported from abroad — usually American models — could be paid for in dollars. The {{lack of access to}} foreign exchange to finance overseas aircraft purchases prior to the change in legislation had compelled all private UK airlines to equip their fleets either with British-built civilian/ex-military aircraft or war-surplus, foreign-built military transport planes that had served with the RAF Transport Command — mainly Douglas Dakotas. Their state-owned counterparts had to seek Government dispensation to import foreign aircraft, which was only granted when no suitable British alternatives were available. These measures had been designed during the early post-war years to conserve as much of Britain's scarce US dollar-denominated foreign exchange reserves as possible.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the implementation of}} the <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> with reference to the reconstruction and development housing programme (RDP) in Limpopo Province. The research objective {{of this study is to}} assess the institutional capacity of the Department of Local Government and Housing (DLGH) in Limpopo Province in implementing the <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> in relation to the reconstruction and development housing programme. Further, the monitoring and evaluation mechanisms determined by the Department of Local Government and Housing to oversee {{the implementation of the}} <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> with reference to the RDP houses. In realising the research objectives of this study, the qualitative research methodology was adopted as the study seeks to understand the situation in its naturalistic form. Therefore, pre-determined interview questions were used to interview those who interact directly or indirectly with the implementation of the <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> with reference to the RDP houses. The purpose was to solicit relevant information and subjective experience from the agents of <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> implementation as well as the beneficiaries of the RDP houses. Not forgetting that qualitative research, studies phenomenon in its natural occurrence and it avoids simplifying, rather, it observes a subject on its multifaceted form. The data collected through interviews was useful in providing relevant policy information of which was unknown and instrumental for this study’s investigation. The study of Public Administration is regarded as the management of public programmes and as such that is possible through public policy, organising, finance, human resource, work standard and procedure, and control measures. It is therefore, indispensable for the Department of Local Government and Housing in Limpopo Province to embody these functions of public management. Thus this study focused on the institutional capacity in terms of <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> implementation, focusing on whether the Department of Local Government and Housing has sufficient resources such as human capital, equipments and material in implementing the <b>procurement</b> <b>policy.</b> An empirical study was conducted to collect insights and subjective experiences from those who constantly interact with the implementation of the <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> concerning the effectiveness and success of the <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> with reference to the RDP houses. The interview questions were directed to prospective members of the DLGH those responsible for procuring, implementing and those affected (beneficiaries). From the findings, the study proved that the Department of Local Government and Housing in Limpopo is confronted with many challenges as far as the implementation of the <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> with reference to the RDP houses is concerned. The study has suggested recommendations for the improvement of the institutional capacity of the Department of Local Government and Housing in implementing the <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> with reference to the RDP houses.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a counterexample to the Miyagiwa ((1991) American Economic Review 81, 1320 – 1328) claim that discriminatory government <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> is ineffective as a protectionist device, when the goods are also {{consumed by the}} private sector. The procurement sector is a homogeneous product Cournot–Nash duopoly, with a home and a foreign firm. The <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> {{takes the form of}} an ad valorem premium over the import price. If both the firms play the output game in strategic complements, <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> can lower imports. This possibility arises when the product demand is unit elastic, corresponding to cash limits to public expenditure, and providing the home firm is smaller than the foreign firm. By adding a competitive export sector, the paper also derives sufficient conditions for macroeconomic coordination failures to occur.

This research effort explore {{the merit of}} developing a <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> manual for purchasing organizations within the Navy Field Contracting System (NFCS). The structure, content, uses, advantages, and methods for evaluating effectiveness found in the literature, {{as well as the}} generic characteristics of a <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> manual, are identified and discussed. These properties are then applied to Navy purchasing manuals and questionnaires received from participating contracting activities and the differences and similarities analyzed. The research concludes that <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> manuals are useful and Navy contracting organizations should be encouraged to develop and use them. Many Navy manuals are not well organized and are often too technical. The generic characteristics of desirable manuals should be incorporated into the planning stage of manual development. Recommendations include encouraging the use of the manuals, applying the generic characteristics, training the <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> specialists, measuring manual effectiveness, making the manuals a part of procurement training, and using the manuals to evaluate purchasing performance.
