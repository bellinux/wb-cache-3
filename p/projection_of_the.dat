5|$|The known {{expansion}} {{rate of the}} Homunculus Nebula provides an unusual geometric method for measuring its distance. Assuming that the two lobes of the nebula are symmetrical, the <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nebula onto the sky depends on its distance. Values of 2,300, 2,250 and 2,300parsecs have been derived for the Homunculus, and Eta Carinae is clearly at the same distance.|$|E

5|$|Cloud, a single-player {{video game}} for Microsoft Windows, {{centers on a}} boy who dreams of flying through the sky while asleep in a {{hospital}} bed. The player assumes control of the sleeping boy's avatar—the <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boy into his dream world—and guides him through his dream {{of a small group}} of islands with a light gathering of clouds. The avatar's direction and speed are controlled with a mouse; movement is generally on a horizontal plane, but vertical flight can be attained by holding down the third button of the mouse. The player may interact with clouds only while flying horizontally.|$|E
5|$|In {{approximately}} 1200 a north aisle was added, {{with its}} width being {{determined by the}} <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north transept chapel, with the west and east walls taken down at the time. The different thickness of the walls in the present church suggests that the wall {{for the length of}} the first three bays of the arcade was taken down and rebuilt in the 13th century. The church underwent a restoration in 1839, with £370 being spent, and in 1875 at a cost of £2,377.|$|E
5|$|Late in the game, Vanessa discovers a clone {{of herself}} in a CAMS {{facility}} but is forced to abandon her when the building's self-destruct sequence is initiated. After destroying the CAMS central core, Vanessa encounters a digital <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> client, whose appearance is identical to her own. She speculates {{that she is a}} clone of the client, but the client counters that none of their memories may be real. Vanessa debates whether to continue her work as a mercenary as the game ends.|$|E

5|$|Tarbosaurus lacked these bony struts, and the {{connection}} between the nasals and lacrimals was weak. Instead, a backwards <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maxilla was massively developed in Tarbosaurus and fit inside a sheath formed from the lacrimal. This projection was a thin, bony plate in North American tyrannosaurids. The large backwards projection suggests that force was transmitted more directly from the maxilla to the lacrimal in Tarbosaurus. The lacrimal was also more firmly anchored to the frontal and prefrontal bones in Tarbosaurus. The well-developed connections between the maxilla, lacrimal, frontal and prefrontal would have made its entire upper jaw more rigid.|$|E
5|$|The final lasted {{six hours}} and was played {{in front of}} a crowd of nearly 20,000 fans at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. A <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> minimap which showed each team's map control was shown {{on the floor of the}} arena between the two teams.

It was the first finals series in a League of Legends world championship to go the full five games.|$|E

25|$|A {{technique}} to eliminate mechanical scanning of the grating and still retain the maximum spatial resolution is electronic phase stepping. It scans the source spot of the x-ray tube with an electro-magnetic field. This causes the <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> object {{to move in}} the opposite direction, and also causes a relative movement between the projection and the Moiré fringes. The images are digitally shifted to realign the projections. The end result is that the <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> object is stationary, while the Moiré fringes move over it. This technique effectively synthesizes the phase stepping process, but without the costs and delays associated with mechanical movements.|$|E
