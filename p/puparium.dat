25|$|During the pre-pupal stage, {{the larvae}} begin to excrete a silk-like white liquid from their salivary glands which solidifies {{into a sort}} of scleritized {{protective}} film from which the <b>puparium</b> will form. The <b>puparium</b> is 7–8mm in length and a brown-red color. The <b>puparium</b> is covered by a dirty white cocoon.|$|E
25|$|Parasites {{include the}} tachinid flies Sturmia convergens and Lespesia archippivora. Lesperia-parasitized {{butterfly}} larvae suspend, but die prior to pupation. The fly's maggot lowers {{itself to the}} ground, forms a brown <b>puparium</b> and then emerges as an adult.|$|E
25|$|Tsetse next {{develop a}} hard {{external}} case, the <b>puparium,</b> and become pupaesmall, hard-shelled, oblongs with two distinctive, small, dark lobes {{at the tail}} (breathing) end. Tsetse pupae are under 1.0cm long. Within the puparial shell, tsetse complete the last two larval instars and the pupal stage.|$|E
25|$|Pupation occurs {{relatively}} {{close to}} the food source of the S. nudiseta larvae {{because they tend to}} not typically migrate very far. S. nudiseta larvae {{are one of the few}} species that can successfully pupate in a confined location. Besides the encasing cocoon, the outside environment is also helpful to the protection of this <b>puparium</b> since dust and soil particles have been found coating the outside surface.|$|E
25|$|These flies {{are closely}} similar to Stomoxys and Haematobia, but are larger {{and of a}} paler brown color. Tsetse-flies of both sexes are robust fliers adapted for hunting their hosts during daytime. Male adults support their mating {{activity}} with repeated meals of blood from cattle and similar wild bovid hosts, also wild pigs and warthogs are favored. Life-cycle of tsetse-fly is highly specialized. Females take repeated small meals of blood to support the development within their abdomen of a single larvae over one period. This will be repeated for {{as many times as}} the female is able to survive, depending mostly on availability of hosts. The single larva emerges fully grown from the female, weighing more than the female. Then the larva immediately burrows into dry sandy soil to pupate within a protective <b>puparium.</b> A new adult emerges from the <b>puparium</b> after a complete metamorphosis. This is known as larviparous reproduction, with the advantage of high survival rate of offspring, but few offspring are produced by each female.|$|E
25|$|The larvae of F. scalaris, when full grown, are 6 to 8mm in length, {{white or}} cream colored, and {{slightly}} flattened dorsally. They have long tubercles on every segment with the {{projections of the}} eighth segment longer than both the seventh and eighth segments put together. The protuberances are feathered due to their preferences for semi-liquid organic matter. They {{are similar to the}} hairy maggot blowfly in appearance but smaller in size. During the pupal stage, the <b>puparium</b> is brown in color and the same shape as the larvae.|$|E
25|$|A prepupal {{stage is}} often present and {{characterized}} by larval dispersion and migration {{away from the}} food source {{in search of a}} pupation site. The body length of the larva decreases during this stage in preparation for pupation. If the larvae are restricted from movement and not allowed to disperse during the prepupal stage, a 24-hour delay in pupation will be observed. Thus, in medicocriminal investigations, if a corpse is wrapped and causes restriction of maggot migration, altered developmental times should be considered. The prepupal stage takes 1.5 days and the pupal stage takes 3 days at a temperature of 29°C. Pupation usually occurs near the soil surface or near decaying flesh, and the skin of the larvae hardens to form a dark brown <b>puparium</b> or outer casing. Adults emerge after pupation and mate 3–7 days after emergence in summer, and 910 days after emergence in autumn. Adults are capable of living for 2330 days, and oviposition occurs about 5 days after mating.|$|E
500|$|The pupae take various forms. In some groups, {{particularly}} the Nematocera, the pupa is intermediate between the larval and adult form; these pupae {{are described as}} [...] "obtect", having the future appendages visible as structures that adhere to the pupal body. The outer surface of the pupa may be leathery and bear spines, respiratory features or locomotory paddles. In other groups, described as [...] "coarctate", the appendages are not visible. In these, the outer surface is a <b>puparium,</b> formed from the last larval skin, and the actual pupa is concealed within. When the adult insect is ready to emerge from this tough, desiccation-resistant capsule, it inflates a balloon-like structure on its head, and forces its way out.|$|E
2500|$|The {{developmental}} {{period for}} D. melanogaster varies with temperature, {{as with many}} ectothermic species. The shortest development time (egg to adult), 7 days, is achieved at [...] Development times increase at higher temperatures (11 days at [...] ) due to heat stress. Under ideal conditions, the development time at [...] is 8.5 days, at [...] it takes 19 days and at [...] it takes over 50 days. Under crowded conditions, development time increases, while the emerging flies are smaller. Females lay some 400 eggs (embryos), about five at a time, into rotting fruit or other suitable material such as decaying mushrooms and sap fluxes. The eggs, which are about 0.5mm long, hatch after 12–15 hours (at [...] ). The resulting larvae grow for about 4 days (at 25°C) while molting twice (into second- and third-instar larvae), at about 24 and 48 h after hatching. During this time, they feed on the microorganisms that decompose the fruit, {{as well as on}} the sugar of the fruit itself. The mother puts feces on the egg sacs to establish the same microbial composition in the larvae's guts which has worked positively for herself. Then the larvae encapsulate in the <b>puparium</b> and undergo a four-day-long metamorphosis (at 25°C), after which the adults eclose (emerge).|$|E

50|$|The pupal stage {{takes place}} inside the <b>puparium,</b> an {{elliptical}} shell {{formed by the}} last exuvial transformation of the larva. The <b>puparium</b> is 3.5 to 4.5 mm long, varying in colour from creamy white to yellow-brown, when it is dry. The change in colour of the <b>puparium</b> can determine {{the age of the}} pupa.|$|E
50|$|Alysiinae are koinobiont endoparasitoids of cyclorrhaphus Diptera. Females oviposit into host eggs or larvae. The host {{is allowed}} to develop until it forms a <b>puparium,</b> at which point it is killed by the wasp larva. The Alysiinae larva then pupates within the host <b>puparium.</b> Adults use their exodont mandibles to break free of the tough host <b>puparium.</b> Most species of Alysiinae are solitary, but a few are gregarious and lay {{multiple}} eggs within one host.|$|E

50|$|The larvae {{typically}} {{kill their}} host in about 10 days. After {{emerging from a}} host, the white maggot forms a smooth, reddish brown case called a <b>puparium</b> around itself.

50|$|Upon encountering a {{suitable}} pupal host the Nasonia female uses her ovipositor (stinger) to drill {{a small hole}} through its chitinous outer <b>puparium.</b> She then commences to inject venom into the host before laying 20 to 40 small eggs on the hosts outer integument. After approximately 36 hours the eggs hatch and the small Nasonia larvae use their mandibles to feed on the host. Though the Nasonia young develop inside of the host's <b>puparium,</b> as they do not directly enter the body of their prey they are considered ectoparasites.|$|E

50|$|There {{generally}} are four larval instars. All the instars {{are more or}} less {{in the shape of a}} flattened ellipse fringed with bristles and waxy filaments. The first instar has functional legs, though short. Once it has inserted its stylets into the phloem to feed, it settles down and no longer uses its legs, and they degenerate after the first ecdysis. From then until it emerges as an adult, it remains attached to the plant by its mouthparts. The final instar feeds for a while, then undergoes changes within its skin, ceasing feeding and growing a new skin, forming what amounts to pupa. In doing so the insect does not shed the larval skin, which it retains as a protective <b>puparium</b> and which dries out. Meanwhile, the pupa within this skin develops into a pharate adult that usually is visible through the wall of the <b>puparium.</b> The <b>puparium</b> splits open as the imago forces its way out.|$|E

5000|$|Both {{males and}} females of Lipoptena cervi consume blood from their hosts. Feeding lasts 15 to 25 minutes. The female {{produces}} one larva {{at a time and}} retains the developing larva in her body until it is ready to pupate. The larva feeds on the secretions of a [...] "milk gland" [...] in the uterus of its mother. The female will give birth to one fully mature white pre-pupa. She may produce larvae for as long as 10 months. A newborn pre-pupa will immediately darken, form the <b>puparium</b> and begin to pupate on the forest floor, or where the deer bedded.
