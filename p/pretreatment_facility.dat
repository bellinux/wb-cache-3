40|$|The {{volume of}} solid {{radioactive}} waste (SRW) generated from decommissioning Russia’s nuclear submarines far exceeds existing SRW management {{capabilities of the}} Russian Northern Fleet. Inadequate management of this waste poses a substantial threat for pollution of the fragile Arctic environment. The Arctic Military Environmental Cooperation (AMEC) Project 1. 3 has assessed waste treatment options, selected technologies, and is now designing and constructing a comprehensive SRW pretreatment system to meet this problem (1). The chosen approach is to design, construct and deploy a novel Mobile SRW <b>Pretreatment</b> <b>Facility</b> (MPF).

Due to recent concerns over potential radiological and chemical degradation of SuperLig(R) 644 resin and increased pressure drops observed during pilot-scale column studies, an increased interest in developing a potential backup ion-exchanger material has resulted. Ideally, a backup ion-exchanger material would replace the SuperLig(R) 644 resin and have no other major impacts on the <b>pretreatment</b> <b>facility</b> flowsheet. Such an ideal exchanger has not been identified to date. However, Crystalline Silicotitanate (CST) ion-exchanger materials have been studied {{for the removal of}} cesium from a variety of DOE wastes over the last decade. CST ion-exchanger materials demonstrate a high affinity for cesium under high alkalinity conditions and have been under investigation for cesium removal specifically at Hanford and SRS during the last six years.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{experiments and}} engineering evaluations {{conducted in a}} project funded by the Department of Energy, Office of Environmental Cleanup and Acceleration to develop improved sorbent materials for strontium/actinide separations at SRS. From the results of Phase 1 activities of the project, we offer the following conclusions and recommendations. Chemically modified monosodium titanate (MST) samples exhibited significantly increased actinide removal performance compared to the baseline MST. Testing {{results indicate that the}} modified MST offers the possibility of reduced MST concentrations and shorter contact times compared to the baseline MST. Preliminary calculations indicate that the use of the optimized MST sorbent will provide significantly increased waste throughput in the ARP facilities should shorter batch contact times and reduced MST concentrations be realized. The maximum throughput increases are realized using a 0. 1 -micron pore-size filter media in these facilities. Evaluation of the impacts of incorporating MST into DWPF operations indicates that both the baseline MST and optimized MST (4 X decrease) quantities can be accommodated from Chemical Processing Cell (CPC) and glass formulation perspectives. We recommend that the MST materials be tested to determine the effects, if any, that introduction of MST has on slurry rheology, antifoam effectiveness, potential generation of hydrogen and processing time in the CPC. Evaluation of the impacts of MST and titanosilicate analog of pharmacosiderite (TSP) materials determined that the use of these materials showed no significant impacts on the SWPF and Saltstone facility. Based on the promising enhanced actinide removal performance of the chemically modified MST samples, which could have significant positive impacts on the SWPF, ARP and perhaps an in-tank deployment for Sr/actinide removal, we recommend that the Department of Energy continue funding to develop chemically modified MST materials. Dried MST exhibited poorer strontium and alpha removal kinetics, which may adversely impact process cycle times and waste feed throughput. Thus, we recommend that <b>pretreatment</b> <b>facilities</b> not use dried MST. Samples of TSP, sodium nonatitanate (SNT) templated-MST and pH-adjusted MST materials did not exhibit significantly improved strontium and actinide removal performance compared to the baseline MST. Thus, we halted further development of these materials. Nb-SNT exhibited evidence of chemical instability upon contact with strongly alkaline salt solutions for several days.

40|$|Presented on March 7, 2012 from 4 - 5 pm in room G 011 of the Molecular Science and Engineering Building. Dr. David T. Hobbs is a Senior Advisory Scientist at the Savannah River National Laboratory. Runtime: 59 : 37 minutesThe Savannah River Site (SRS) {{operated}} five {{heavy water}} nuclear reactors and two separation canyons {{for the production}} of nuclear materials for defense, special isotope production and space programs. These operations produced more than 100 million gallons of high-level nuclear waste (HLW), which has been stored in underground carbon steel tanks. The highly alkaline HLW consists of three forms; precipitated metal hydroxides and hydrous metal oxides referred to as sludge, supernatant liquids or supernate, and crystalline sodium salts referred to as saltcake that are formed upon evaporation and cooling of waste supernates. The current inventory of HLW at SRS is about 38 million gallons. Disposition of the HLW seeks to immobilize more than 99 % of the radioactivity in a highly durable borosilicate glass wasteform. Concentrated liquid and saltcake are retrieved and pretreated to remove cesium, strontium, and alpha-emitting radionuclides. The separated radioactive components transfer into the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) for vitrification along with the sludge fraction of the HLW. The decontaminated liquid waste transfers into the Saltstone Production Facility (SPF) for incorporation into a cement wasteform for onsite disposal as a low-level waste. The DWPF began radioactive service in 1996 and to date has produced more than 3250 glass canisters. The SPF began radioactive operations in 1990 and has immobilized more than XX million gallons of decontaminated waste liquids. Two pilot-scale <b>pretreatment</b> <b>facilities,</b> the Actinide Removal Process (ARP) and the Modular Caustic Side Solvent Extraction Unit (MCU) began radioactive operations at SRS in 2008. The ARP facility uses an inorganic ion exchanger, monosodium titanate (MST), to remove 90 Sr and alpha-emitting radionuclides (principally 238 Pu, 239 Pu, 240 Pu and 237 Np). Following treatment with MST, the waste passes into the MCU for removal of radio-cesium using a calixarene extractant. The Salt Waste Processing Facility (SWPF), currently under construction will use these same processes to treat the HLW at a throughput of about 7 million gallons per year beginning in 2014. A new initiative, referred to as the Small Column Ion Exchange (SCIX) process is under development to accelerate pretreatment of salt wastes at SRS.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of River Protection (ORP), is {{responsible}} for the remediation and stabilization of the Hanford Site tank farms, including 53 million gallons of highly radioactive mixed wasted waste contained in 177 underground tanks. The plan calls for all waste retrieved from the tanks to be transferred to the Waste Treatment Plant (WTP). The WTP will consist of three primary <b>facilities</b> including <b>pretreatment</b> <b>facilities</b> for Low Activity Waste (LAW) to remove aluminum, chromium and other solids and radioisotopes that are undesirable in the High Level Waste (HLW) stream. Removal of aluminum from HLW sludge can be accomplished through continuous sludge leaching of the aluminum from the HLW sludge as sodium aluminate; however, this process will introduce a significant amount of sodium hydroxide into the waste stream and consequently will increase the volume of waste to be dispositioned. A sodium recovery process is needed to remove the sodium hydroxide and recycle it back to the aluminum dissolution process. The resulting LAW waste stream has a high concentration of aluminum and sodium and will require alternative immobilization methods. Five waste forms were evaluated for immobilization of LAW at Hanford after the sodium recovery process. The waste forms considered for these two waste streams include low temperature processes (Saltstone/Cast stone and geopolymers), intermediate temperature processes (steam reforming and phosphate glasses) and high temperature processes (vitrification). These immobilization methods and the waste forms produced were evaluated for (1) compliance with the Performance Assessment (PA) requirements for disposal at the IDF, (2) waste form volume (waste loading), and (3) compatibility with the tank farms and systems. The iron phosphate glasses tested using the product consistency test had normalized release rates lower than the waste form requirements although the CCC glasses had higher release rates than the quenched glasses. However, the waste form failed to meet the vapor hydration test criteria listed in the WTP contract. In addition, the waste loading in the phosphate glasses were not as high as other candidate waste forms. Vitrification of HLW waste as borosilicate glass is a proven process; however the HLW and LAW streams at Hanford can vary significantly from waste currently being immobilized. The ccc glasses show lower release rates for B and Na than the quenched glasses and all glasses meet the acceptance criterion of < 4 g/L. Glass samples spiked with Re{sub 2 }O{sub 7 } also passed the PCT test. However, further vapor hydration testing must be performed since all the samples cracked and the test could not be performed. The waste loading of the iron phosphate and borosilicate glasses are approximately 20 and 25 % respectively. The steam reforming process produced the predicted waste form for both the high and low aluminate waste streams. The predicted waste loadings for the monolithic samples is approximately 39 %, which is higher than the glass waste forms; however, {{at the time of this}} report, no monolithic samples were made and therefore compliance with the PA cannot be determined. The waste loading in the geopolymer is approximately 40 % but can vary with the sodium hydroxide content in the waste stream. Initial geopolymer mixes revealed compressive strengths that are greater than 500 psi for the low aluminate mixes and less than 500 psi for the high aluminate mixes. Further work testing needs to be performed to formulate a geopolymer waste form made using a high aluminate salt solution. A cementitious waste form has the advantage that the process is performed at ambient conditions and is a proven process currently in use for LAW disposal. The Saltstone/Cast Stone formulated using low and high aluminate salt solutions retained at least 97 % of the Re that was added to the mix as a dopant. While this data is promising, additional leaching testing must be performed to show compliance with the PA. Compressive strength tests must also be performed on the Cast Stone monoliths to verify PA compliance. Based on testing performed for this report, the borosilicate glass and Cast Stone are the recommended waste forms for further testing. Both are proven technologies for radioactive waste disposal and the initial testing using simulated Hanford LAW waste shows compliance with the PA. Both are resistant to leaching and have greater than 25 % waste loading...|$|R
40|$|The Chauvet-Pont d'Arc Cave {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} sites for the study of the earliest manifestations and development of prehistoric art at the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic. Different dating techniques have been performed thus far (AMS C- 14, U/Th TIMS, Cl- 36 dating) to model the chronological framework of this decorated cave. The cave yielded several large charcoal fragments, which enabled the opportunity for obtaining multiple dates; thus, a First Radiocarbon Intercomparison Program (FIP) was initiated in 2004 using three charcoal pieces. The FIP demonstrated that those cross-dated samples belonged to a time period associated with the first human occupation. One of the statistical interests of an intercomparison program is to reduce the uncertainty on the sample age; thus, to further assess the accuracy of the chronological framework, the Second Intercomparison Program (SIP) involving 10 international C- 14 laboratories was carried out on two pieces of charcoal found inside two hearth structures of the Galerie des Megaceros. Each laboratory used its own <b>pretreatment</b> and AMS <b>facilities.</b> In total, 21 and 22 measurements were performed, respectively, which yielded consistent results averaging similar to 32 ka BP. Two strategies have currently been developed to identify statistical outliers and to deal with them; both lead to quasi-identical calibrated combined densities. Finally, the new results were compared with those of the FIP, leading to the important conclusion that five different samples from at least three different hearth structures give really tightened temporal densities, associated with one short human occupation in the Galerie des Megaceros...|$|R
40|$|An {{expert system}} prototype, Compost Design Consultant (CDC), was {{developed}} to aid the preliminary design of composting facilities for municipal solid waste. The prototype development process for the CDC adopted a modular approach, which covered the main design tasks for the selected composting system. These covered,' the reception facilities, the materials handling equipment, the storage <b>facilities,</b> <b>pretreatment</b> processes, feedstock conditioning, composting process control, posttreatment processes, site requ,irements, operational considerations, market planning and environmental considerations. An expert system shell, Kappa-pc (version 2. 1), was preferred as the building tool {{for the development of}} the prototype because of its object-oriented approach that combines the two main knowledge representation techniques, i. e. production rules and objects. It was also found to offer advantages with respect to ease of manipulation, increased productivity and a true windowing capability to run on personal computers. The main issues addressed in the expert system development were the knowledge acquisition process and the building of the prototype. The major steps involved were problem definition, implementation and testing. The knowledge used in the system was acquired from many sources such as textbooks, manuals and guidelines, journals, reports, case studies and domain experts. In the CDC consultation process, the user can evaluate the most suitable composting system for a particular site based on local conditions, and other design requirements for the facility. A summary of the system's recommendations and additional information on the Composting System Module was shown as an example to evaluate the performance of CDC consultation process, which was considered satisfactory. The primary, end-users of the CDC would be consulting engineers, waste management engineers, recycling coordinators, municipal managers and decisions-makers, who would use it as an aid to their decision making proces...|$|R
40|$|Non-elutable {{crystalline}} silicotitanate (CST) ion-exchanger {{materials have}} been studied for removing cesium {{from a variety of}} radioactive wastes at several U. S. DOE sites over the last decade. For the current <b>pretreatment</b> <b>facility</b> design of the River Protection Project (RPP) Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) in Hanford, the removal of cesium from low activity waste (LAW) is achieved by ion-exchange technology based on SuperLig(R) 644 resin. However, due to concerns over potential radiological and chemical degradation of SuperLig(R) 644 resin, IONSIV IE- 911 (CST in its engineered form) material is being proposed as a backup ion-exchange material for the removal of cesium from Hanford radioactive waste. This paper discusses the methodology used to determine the optimal CST ion-exchange column size to process all 16 separate batches of feeds from the ten targeted Hanford waste tanks. The optimal design ensures the best utilization of CST material and therefore results in a minimum amount of spent CST...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of River Protection’s Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) {{is being}} {{designed}} and built to pretreat and then vitrify {{a large portion of}} the wastes in Hanford’s 177 underground waste storage tanks. The WTP consists of three primary facilities: pretreatment, low-activity waste (LAW) vitrification, and high-level waste (HLW) vitrification. The <b>pretreatment</b> <b>facility</b> will receive waste feed from the Hanford tank farms and separate it into 1) a high-volume, low-activity liquid stream stripped of most solids and radionuclides and 2) a much smaller volume of HLW slurry containing most of the solids and most of the radioactivity. Many of the vessels in the <b>pretreatment</b> <b>facility</b> will contain pulse jet mixers (PJMs) that will provide some or all of the mixing in the vessels. This technology was selected for use in so-called “black cell” regions of the WTP, where maintenance capability will not be available for the operating life of the WTP. PJM technology was selected for use in these regions because it has no moving mechanical parts that require maintenance. The vessels with the most concentrated slurries will also be mixed with air spargers and/or steady jets in addition to the mixing provided by the PJMs. This report contains the results of single and multiple PJM overblow tests conducted in a large, ~ 13 ft-diameter × 15 -ft-tall tank located in the high bay of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) 336 Building test facility. These single and multiple PJM overblow tests were conducted using water and a clay simulant to bound the lower and upper rheological properties of the waste streams anticipated to be processed in the WTP. Hydrodynamic pressures were measured at a number of locations in the test vessel using an array of nine pressure sensors and four hydrophones. These measurements were made under normal and limiting vessel operating conditions (i. e., maximum PJM fluid emptying velocity, maximum and minimum vessel contents for PJM operation, and maximum and minimum rheological properties). Test data collected from the PJM overblow tests were provided to Bechtel National, Inc. (BNI) for assessing hydrostatic, dynamic, and acoustic pressure loadings on in-tank structures during 1) single overblows; 2) multiple overlapping overblows of two to four PJMs; 3) simultaneous overblows of pairs of PJMs...|$|E
40|$|The Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) {{process flow}} was {{designed}} to pre-treat feed from the Hanford tank farms, separate it into a High Level Waste (HLW) and Low Activity Waste (LAW) fraction and vitrify each fraction in separate facilities. Vitrification of the waste generates an aqueous condensate stream from the off-gas processes. This stream originates from two off-gas treatment unit operations, the Submerged Bed Scrubber (SBS) and the Wet Electrospray Precipitator (WESP). Currently, the baseline plan for disposition of the stream from the LAW melter is to recycle it to the <b>Pretreatment</b> <b>facility</b> where it gets evaporated and processed into the LAW melter again. If the <b>Pretreatment</b> <b>facility</b> is not available, the baseline disposition pathway is not viable. Additionally, some components in the stream are volatile at melter temperatures, thereby accumulating to high concentrations in the scrubbed stream. It would be highly beneficial to divert this stream to an alternate disposition path to alleviate the close-coupled operation of the LAW vitrification and Pretreatment facilities, and to improve long-term throughput and efficiency of the WTP system. In order to determine an alternate disposition path for the LAW SBS/WESP Recycle stream, a range of options are being studied. A simulant of the LAW Off-Gas Condensate was developed, based on the projected composition of this stream, and comparison with pilot-scale testing. The primary radionuclide that vaporizes and accumulates in the stream is Tc- 99, but small amounts of several other radionuclides are also projected {{to be present in}} this stream. The processes being investigated for managing this stream includes evaporation and radionuclide removal via precipitation and adsorption. During evaporation, it is of interest to investigate the formation of insoluble solids to avoid scaling and plugging of equipment. Key parameters for radionuclide removal include identifying effective precipitation or ion adsorption chemicals, solid-liquid separation methods, and achievable decontamination factors. Results of the radionuclide removal testing indicate that the radionuclides, including Tc- 99, can be removed with inorganic sorbents and precipitating agents. Evaporation test results indicate that the simulant can be evaporated to fairly high concentration prior to formation of appreciable solids, but corrosion has not yet been examined...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{objectives of}} the DM 100 tests were to determine the processing characteristics of several C- 106 /AY 102 feeds derived from simulants prepared by different methods, which result in different physical characteristics of the feed. The VSL simulant used in a previous test was prepared by the direct hydroxide method, which was the method used for feed preparation in the bulk of previous VSL melter testing. The NOAH Technologies Corporation modified-rheology simulant was prepared to the same composition as the VSL simulant using a method that resulted in rheological properties closer to those of certain actual waste samples. The SIPP simulant was produced by processing a co-precipitated waste simulant through a non-radioactive pilot scale semi-integrated <b>pretreatment</b> <b>facility.</b> The general intent of these tests {{was to provide a}} basis for determining whether the variations in rheology or other feed physical characteristics arising from the different methods of simulant preparation have significant effects on the processing characteristics of the feed in the melter. Completion of the test objectives is detailed in a table...|$|E
40|$|A {{testing program}} {{evaluating}} actual tank waste {{was developed in}} response to Task 4 from the M- 12 External Flowsheet Review Team (EFRT) issue response plan. () The test program was subdivided into logical increments. The bulk water-insoluble solid wastes that are anticipated to be delivered to the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) were identified according to type such that the actual waste testing could be targeted to the relevant categories. Under test plan TP-RPP-WTP- 467, eight broad waste groupings were defined. Samples available from the 222 S archive were identified and obtained for testing. Under this test plan, a waste-testing program was implemented that included: • Homogenizing the archive samples by group as defined in the test plan • Characterizing the homogenized sample groups • Performing parametric leaching testing on each group for compounds of interest • Performing bench-top filtration/leaching tests in the hot cell for each group to simulate filtration and leaching activities if they occurred in the UFP 2 vessel of the WTP <b>Pretreatment</b> <b>Facility.</b> This report focuses on filtration/leaching tests performed {{on two of the}} eight waste composite samples and follow-on parametric tests to support aluminum leaching results from those tests...|$|E
40|$|Many {{different}} industries generate {{waste water}} streams that contain organic compounds. Nearly {{all of these}} streams undergo collection, contaminant treatment, and/or storage operations before they are finally discharged into either areceiving body of water or amunicipal treatment plant for further treatment. During some of these operations, the waste water {{is open to the}} atmosphere, and volatile organic compounds (VOC) may be emitted from the waste water into the air. Industrial waste water operations can range from pretreatment to full-scale treatment processes. In atypical <b>pretreatment</b> <b>facility,</b> process and/or sanitary waste water and/or storm water runoff is collected, equalized, and/or neutralized and then discharged to amunicipal waste water plant, also known as apublicly owned treatment works (POTWs), where it is then typically treated further by biodegradation. In afull-scale treatment operation, the waste water must meet Federal and/or state quality standards before it is finally discharged into areceiving body of water. Figure 4. 3 - 1 shows ageneric example of collection, equalization, neutralization, and biotreatment of process waste water in afullscale industrial treatment facility. If required, chlorine is added as adisinfectant. Astorage basin contains the treated water until the winter months (usually January to May), when the facility i...|$|E
