The {{reason for this is}} that when the solvent is in its standard state its activity is defined as one. For example, the standard state of water:dioxane 9:1 is <b>precisely</b> <b>that</b> solvent mixture, with no added solutes. To obtain the pKa value for use with aqueous solutions it has to be extrapolated to zero co-solvent concentration from values obtained from various co-solvent mixtures.|$|E

During the pulling of a wishbone, Homer, who has been constantly jealous of the material success of Ned and his family, wishes for The Leftorium to be a failure and go out of business. Homer frequently checks in on Ned to ensure that business is going poorly and is happy to see <b>precisely</b> <b>that</b> happening. When Homer sees left-handed citizens struggling with items made for right-handed people, he thinks about informing them about The Leftorium, but decides not to. Eventually the store does indeed close due to lack of business, plunging the Flanders' into debt and misery. Ned is forced to sell his possessions, and Homer gleefully buys many of Ned's things. Homer starts to regret what he did, but when he goes to return Ned's possessions, he finds Ned's house repossessed and the family living in their car. Homer wrestles with the guilt his wish has brought, and tells Ned to open the store for one final day. He then tells all the left-handed residents of Springfield about The Leftorium, and they all travel to the store and buy things. The increase in customers helps Ned keep the store open and get his house back.|$|E

25|$|Shakespeare satirizes the {{hyperbole}} of the allusions used {{by conventional}} poets, which {{even by the}} Elizabethan era, had become cliché, predictable, and uninspiring. This sonnet compares the poet's mistress {{to a number of}} natural beauties; each time making a point of his mistress' obvious inadequacy in such comparisons; she cannot hope {{to stand up to the}} beauties of the natural world. The first two quatrains compare the speaker's mistress to aspects of nature, such as snow or coral; each comparison ending unflatteringly for the mistress. In the final couplet, the speaker proclaims his love for his mistress by declaring that he makes no false comparisons, the implication being that other poets do <b>precisely</b> <b>that.</b> Shakespeare's sonnet aims to do the opposite, by indicating that his mistress is the ideal object of his affections because of her genuine qualities, and that she is more worthy of his love than the paramours of other poets who are more fanciful.|$|E

25|$|Instead {{she argues}} for an ethics based {{precisely}} on {{the limits of}} self-knowledge as the limits of responsibility itself. Any concept of responsibility which demands the full transparency of the self to itself, an entirely accountable self, necessarily does violence to the opacity which marks {{the constitution of the}} self it addresses. The scene of address by which responsibility is enabled is always already a relation between subjects who are variably opaque to themselves and to each other. The ethics that Butler envisions is therefore one in which the responsible self knows the limits of its knowing, recognizes the limits of its capacity to give an account of itself to others, and respects those limits as symptomatically human. To take seriously one's opacity to oneself in ethical deliberation means then to critically interrogate the social world in which one comes to be human {{in the first place and}} which remains <b>precisely</b> <b>that</b> which one cannot know about oneself. In this way, Butler locates social and political critique at the core of ethical practice.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese Army, which {{understood}} the logistical problems {{of attempting to}} conquer such a vast country as China far better than Konoe ever did, had objected to the Konoe programme for <b>precisely</b> <b>that</b> reason; it committed Japan to winning a total victory over China that Japan {{did not have the}} power to achieve {{while at the same time}} making anything less than the achievement of the Konoe programme seem like a defeat for Japan. In July 1938, Japan launched an offensive intended to capture Wuhan, and finally win the war. The summer offensive of 1938 succeeded in taking Wuhan, but the Japanese failed to destroy the core of the Chinese National Revolutionary Army, which retreated further up the Yangtze. After the Wuhan offensive, the Imperial Army informed Tokyo that the troops in the central Yangtze valley were at the end of a long, tenuous and very overstretched supply line, and no further advances up the Yangtze were at present possible. Unable to win the final victory on the battlefield, the Japanese turned to bombing as an alternative, launching an all-out bombing campaign intended to raze the temporary capital of Chongqing to the ground.|$|E

The plates were polished to 98percent of their final state and covered with protective white film before being sent to Chicago via trucks.

500|$|Although much of Gibson's {{reputation}} {{has remained}} rooted in Neuromancer, his work continued to evolve conceptually and stylistically.

He next intended to write an unrelated postmodern space opera, titled The Log of the Mustang Sally, but reneged on the contract with Arbor House after a falling out over the dustjacket art of their hardcover of Count Zero. Abandoning The Log of the Mustang Sally, Gibson instead wrote Mona Lisa Overdrive (1988), which in the words of Larry McCaffery [...] "turned off the lights" [...] on cyberpunk literature. It was a culmination of his previous two novels, set in the same universe with shared characters, thereby completing the Sprawl trilogy. The trilogy solidified Gibson's reputation, with both later novels also earning Nebula and Hugo Award and Locus SF Award nominations.|$|E
500|$|Another combat timing {{mechanic}} {{featured in}} the game is the [...] "Charge Meter", which allows players to increase the power of spells or attacks by spending additional time preparing them. This meter is always used for spell casting, as well as when using the [...] "Charge Attack" [...] skill used by the [...] "Monk" [...] class. Although players can choose to act immediately, an ability will become more powerful the longer that the player charges the attack. However, the greater {{the amount of time}} one charges attacks, the longer the charging character must wait before the next turn. As a result of this, players can choose to charge up an ability so that the ability triggers shortly before an enemy acts, or can instead aim for the [...] "sweet spot", a special red area on the charging bar, indicating a charge that allows for less time until the next attack, as well as a smaller mana cost. [...] Overall, deciding on the correct amount of charge and letting go of the button at <b>precisely</b> <b>that</b> time can greatly influence the effectiveness of each character's attacks during combat.|$|E

500|$|Some critics {{highlighted}} Haunting Grounds sexual themes {{surrounding the}} objectification of Fiona {{as one of}} its best elements. Jeremy Dunham of IGN stated that [...] "Haunting Grounds success comes from making the player feel like a desired and endangered object." [...] He found the plot was kept interesting due to the disturbing suggestive behaviors of Fiona's pursuers. Kill Screen's Budgor also found the drive for the enemies to kill Fiona creates a continuous tension, as its unclear nature lends to an uncomfortable confusion for both Fiona and the player. GameSetWatch's Leigh Alexander stated that [...] "disparaging Haunting Ground for its copious objectification of women is a facile task...it’s <b>precisely</b> <b>that</b> off-putting sexuality that makes Daniela terrifying, that makes Fiona’s circumstances so explicitly repugnant, that sharpens Haunting Ground’s fear factor to a knife in the gut." [...] Alexander praised the game's voyeuristic themes and presenting of Fiona as [...] "an object of desire." [...] She notes that [...] "Fiona is both a sex object and a victim...a fragile little woman...both male and female players can distinctly feel the threat to her person, the disconcerting wickedness of her enemies, thanks to her overt sexualization throughout the game." [...] Budgor found that removing the player's control at critical points highlights Fiona's subjectivity, with the sounds and images expressing ideas of [...] "violation, transgression, and bodily autonomy." [...] Alexander ultimately felt Haunting Ground to be a [...] "perfect illustration of how sexuality can be used to great effect." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{objection}} {{seems to}} rest on a misunderstanding of Kant's views since Kant argued that morality is dependent upon {{the concept of a}} rational will (and the related concept of a categorical imperative: an imperative which any rational being must necessarily will for itself). [...] It is not based on contingent features of any being's will, nor upon human wills in particular, so there is no sense in which Kant makes ethics [...] "dependent" [...] upon anything which has not always existed. [...] Furthermore, the sense in which our wills are subject to the law is <b>precisely</b> <b>that</b> if our wills are rational, we must will in a lawlike fashion; that is, we must will according to moral judgments we apply to all rational beings, including ourselves. This is more easily understood by parsing the term [...] "autonomy" [...] into its Greek roots: auto (self) + nomos (rule or law). That is, an autonomous will, according to Kant, is not merely one which follows its own will, but whose will is lawful-that is, conforming to the principle of universalizability, which Kant also identifies with reason. Ironically, in another passage, willing according to immutable reason is precisely the kind of capacity Elshtain ascribes to God as the basis of his moral authority, and she commands this over an inferior voluntarist version of divine command theory, which would make both morality and God's will contingent. Kant's theory is a version of the first rather than the second view of autonomy, so neither God nor any human authority, including contingent human institutions, play any unique authoritative role in his moral theory. Kant and Elshtain, that is, both agree God {{has no choice but to}} conform his will to the immutable facts of reason, including moral truths; humans do have such a choice, but otherwise their relationship to morality is the same as that of God's: they can recognize moral facts, but do not determine their content through contingent acts of will.|$|E
