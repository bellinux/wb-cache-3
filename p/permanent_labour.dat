40|$|In many {{developed}} countries, {{the share}} of <b>permanent</b> hired <b>labour</b> in the total agricultural labour force has been increasing in recent years. Using data from the 1988 and 2000 agricultural censuses in France, we analyse {{the factors that influence}} households' decisions regarding the use of hired labour. We show that the increase in permanent wage employment observed over that period results from two opposite trends: an important increase in the proportion of family farms using <b>permanent</b> wage <b>labour</b> and a slight decrease in the average volume of <b>permanent</b> hired <b>labour</b> per employer. The first trend was mainly due to an improvement in family labour productivity and to a sharp rise in farm size, whereas the second results from a rise in agricultural wages, and possibly also from an increase in the productivity of hired labour.

50|$|The {{emergence}} of industrial-scale mining forced major demographic shifts in South Africa's population. During {{the early stages}} of mining, labour had been primarily provided by young men from the African states, primarily Pedi men. The young men would travel to the mines during the summer to provide temporary labour and earn enough wages to buy status symbols, such as cattle or guns, before returning home. This system, though, was too unreliable to provide a <b>permanent</b> <b>labour</b> force and was not acceptable to the mining corporations. Young men arriving at the mines were often exhausted from their journey and had to be given two weeks' rest, at company expense, before they were fit to work in the mines. Workers who were not paid on time or did not like their living conditions (which were often very harsh due to bad food and disease) tended to drift away, and workers were at risk of being recalled to their own countries, as happened in 1876 when the chief of Pediland recalled all Pedi men at the mines to fight in a war against the Transvaal. The need to create a fixed, <b>permanent</b> <b>labour</b> force at Kimberley and on the Rand became the primary objective of the mining corporations and the colonial government.|$|E

A simple transformation of a Cobb-Douglas function allows us to estimate the relative efficiency of each labour force. Our estimation is based on specialised fruit and vegetable farms over the period 1995 - 2006 drawn from the French sample of the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). We show that the labour force composition affects the farm’s productivity and that family workers are less productive than hired workers even if the specialisation of some hired worker in seasonal high productivity tasks is taking into account. The results suggest that this difference is linked with productivity gains inherent to task specialisation. We also find that seasonal workers are not less productive than permanent ones altought seasonal work in agriculture is synonymous with low earnings, job insecurity and absence of career development...|$|R

In the case of expansions or contractions of output, the demand for <b>permanent</b> skilled <b>labour</b> shows a significant response, mainly in cities such as Pereira. Demand for a temporary unskilled workforce shows high output elasticities in places like Manizales, Cartagena, and Pereira. While Manizales and Pereira have similar employment levels, in Pereira this is driven by apparel while in Manizales by food and beverages. The skilled own-price elasticity is larger in Manizales than Pereira, but output elasticity is larger in Pereira. As a result, we conclude that labour demand in the manufacturing sector is heterogeneous on regional grounds.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the extent to which discrimination early in one's career can have lasting effects on job quality even after the discrimination itself disappears. The results show that for young workers in the 1980 s, discrimination is a short run phenomenon, and furthermore, the effects disappear relatively quickly. This research makes two contributions to the existing empirical literature on labour market discrimination. First, we broaden the measure of discrimination beyond wages by utilizing the Duncan Index of job quality to measure differences in labour market outcomes. Second, most empirical work has been concentrated on the effects of discrimination at a point in time using cross-sectional data. We develop a dynamic model to measure changes in job quality over time as workers gain experience over their first three years in the <b>permanent</b> <b>labour</b> market. From the results found in our empirical work, we are able to analyze the long run impact of initial discrimination. In other words, our methodology allows us to examine time dependent effects that are not observed in cross-sectional studies. ...|$|E

In addition, {{there is evidence that}} the concentration of capital through increased areas of landholdings, through mechanisation and use of agrochemicals produces a rise in under- and unemployment within the agricultural sector, which increases the risk of ill health. This paper addresses this question in Zimbabwe by examining the nature of developments within the large scale agricultural sector in the last decade, and the consequent effects on employment and income. Rising capital intensity in the private large scale sector is found to be associated with increases in unemployment and underemployment. The impact of this socioeconomic pattern on health is assessed in a longitudinal assessment of 78 <b>permanent</b> <b>labour</b> families and 76 non-permanent (underemployed) labour families in the large scale farming sector.

40|$|The Indian {{software}} {{industry is a}} prime example of globalisation. The industry has been characterised by large cross-border mobility of its skilled labour force. Using a unique survey of Indian software firms, our paper quantifies the extent and impact of mobility on firm behaviour and performance. Cross-border labour mobility in the paper refers to both temporary and <b>permanent</b> <b>labour</b> flows by Indian software professionals. The picture that emerges is of a highly mobile world in which temporary mobility has been an important characteristic of the industry. A significant number of workers have work experience abroad in a developed country. Moreover, the share of skilled workers with such experience has been positively associated with the incidence of skilled migration from the firm. This suggests network effects are at work. In terms of the impact on performance - as measured by the change in turnover per worker and the change in the employment size of the firm - the paper finds little evidence of a robust adverse effect. Further, the evidence suggests that there have been important external effects at work, as through changes in the willingness of workers to acquire skills, as well as through increased provision of educational services. These have further abated the risk of a brain drain. However, the {{software industry}} may be rather different from other industries. Our results need to be interpreted as the outcome of a particular case of skilled migration and not one necessarily representative of all types of skilled migration and source sectors.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{friction}} in the matching process arising in a dual labour market where {{good and bad}} jobs coexist. In particular, we present an empirical investigation {{of the role of}} strong preferences for permanent contracts to explain job mismatch and longer unemployment duration. To allow for a more flexible matching technology specification and to control for the role of micro level characteristics, we estimate a matching function using different specifications of hazard models for multiple unemployment spells, allowing both random matching and stock-flow matching mechanisms. We find evidence that the determinants of reemployment probabilities differ by gender. We also find a positive effect from having previous job experiences and, according to semi-parametric specifications, undergoing training while unemployed on reemployment probabilities. Overall we find that higher heterogeneity in searched and offered contract types increases frictions in the matching process. Specifically, individuals looking for a permanent contract experience longer unemployment duration, suggesting the existence of congestion problems related to the <b>permanent</b> job <b>labour</b> market segment. Finally, in order to reduce frictions in the matching process, policies aimed to provide training and to increase desirability of temporary contracts should be promoted.

The 2011 Work and Careers in Australian Universities survey of staff in 19 universities provides data from more than 3000 casual academic staff. Three related issues are investigated: the characteristics of labour supply in the casual academic labour force; the key defining boundaries of labour segmentation; and barriers between casual and permanent academic employment. A typology of casual academic staff is proposed. In particular, gender, type of university and discipline are investigated to examine whether these have an impact on the various measures of career opportunity, job satisfaction and the incidence of the 'frustrated academic'.
