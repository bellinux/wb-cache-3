Therefore, we tested CRB 0017 in a relevant spontaneous OA model, the STR/ort mouse. DesignSTR/ort male mice were recruited at 5 months of age, and treated intra-articularly in each knee with CRB 0017 1. 2  μg, CRB 0017 12  μg, or vehicle. After 6 weeks, the intra-articular administration of CRB 0017 was repeated with the same doses. After 3 months from recruitment, the animals were sacrificed and the femorotibial joints processed for histology and scored in a blind fashion according to both Mankin's and the OARSI methods.

Under the preliminary terms, the United States would lift countervailing and anti-dumping duties provided lumber prices continue to stay above a certain range. Below the specified range, a mixed export tax and quota regime would be implemented on imports of Canadian lumber. On Canada's part, the nation agreed to enforce regulations, {{such as in the}} form of taxes on lumber exports headed to the U.S. The provincial governments of Canada, specifically, were encouraged to make changes to their pricing systems.

Recently, we implemented the multiplex PCR-based Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel (> 200 amplicons in 50 genes) to evaluate EGFR, KRAS, and BRAF in lung and colorectal adenocarcinomas. In 10 % of samples, automated analysis identified a novel G 873 R substitution mutation in EGFR.

To investigate whether any Kd/Dd-restricted responses were activated but did not expand during the primary response, we used a BALB/c mutant, BALB/c-H- 2 dm 2, which does not express the Ld molecule. Splenocytes from LCMV-infected BALB/c mice were transferred into irradiated BALB/c-H- 2 dm 2 mice and rechallenged with LCMV. Thus, they were exposed to an antigenic stimulus without {{the involvement of the}} immunodominant Ld-restricted epitope. In this adoptive transfer model, the donor splenocytes protected the recipient mice against chronic LCMV infection by mounting a potent Kd- and/or Dd-restricted secondary antiviral response. Analysis of a <b>panel</b> of Kd <b>binding</b> LCMV peptides revealed that residues 283 to 291 from the viral glycoprotein (GP(283 - 291)) comprise a major new epitope in the adoptive transfer model. Because the donor splenocytes were first activated during the primary infection in BALB/c mice, the GP(283 - 291) epitope is a subdominant epitope in BALB/c mice that becomes dominant after rechallenge in BALB/c-H- 2 dm 2 mice.

40|$|Prostate cancer (PCa) is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} adenocarcinoma and the second highest cause of cancer-related deaths in men. Early diagnosis is required to identify the development of PCa {{to reduce the risk}} of the disease metastasising to different regions of the body. Multiple biomarkers in serum have been identified for the diagnosis of PCa. However, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and its isoforms remain the gold standard test for PCa detection. Many antibodies have been generated for the detection of PSA with good sensitivities and limits of detection. To ensure reliable assay performance a number of biomarkers for PCa are required to increase specificity and sensitivity thus reducing the number of false positive results upon initial examination. The overall aims of the work presented in this thesis were to generate, select and characterise antibodies to PSA, an important biomarker in PCa. The generation and selection of murine and avian recombinant antibody fragments to free PSA (fPSA) was performed. Animals were immunised, RNA extracted and cDNA synthesised.

Two structurally distinct series of IP receptor antagonists have been developed: 4, 5 -dihydro- 1 H-imidazol- 2 -yl) -[4 -(4 -isopropoxy-benzyl) -phenyl]-amine (RO 1138452) and R- 3 -(4 -fluoro-phenyl) - 2 -[5 -(4 -fluoro-phenyl) -benzofuran- 2 -ylmethoxycarbonylamino]-propionic acid (RO 3244794). RO 1138452 and RO 3244794 display high affinity for IP receptors. In human platelets, the receptor affinities (pKi) were 9. 3 ± 0. 1 and 7. 7 ± 0. 03, respectively; in a recombinant IP receptor system, pKi values were 8. 7 ± 0. 06 and 6. 9 ± 0. 1, respectively. Functional antagonism of RO 1138452 and RO 3244794 was studied by measuring inhibition of carbaprostacyclin-induced cAMP accumulation in CHO-K 1 cells stably expressing the human IP receptor. The antagonist affinities (pKi) of RO 1138452 and RO 3244794 were 9. 0 ± 0. 06 and 8. 5 ± 0. 11, respectively. Selectivity profiles for RO 1138452 and RO 3244794 were determined via a <b>panel</b> of receptor <b>binding</b> and enzyme assays. RO 1138452 displayed affinity at I 2 (8. 3) and PAF (7. 9) receptors, while RO 3244794 was highly selective for the IP receptor: pKi values for EP 1 (< 5), EP 3 (5. 38), EP 4 (5. 74) and TP (5. 09). RO 1138452 (1 – 10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) and RO 3244794 (1 – 30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) significantly reduced acetic acid-induced abdominal constrictions.

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundThe cytoplasmic RIG-like receptors are {{responsible}} for the early detection of viruses and other intracellular microbes by activating the innate immune response mediated by type I interferons (IFNs). RIG-I and MDA 5 detect virus-specific RNA motifs with short 5 ′-tri/diphosphorylated, blunt-end double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and > 0. 5 – 2 kb long dsRNA as canonical agonists, respectively. However, in vitro, they can bind to many RNA species, while in cells there is an activation threshold. As SF 2 helicase/ATPase family members, ATP hydrolysis is dependent on co-operative RNA and ATP binding. Whereas simultaneous ATP and cognate RNA binding is sufficient to activate RIG-I by releasing autoinhibition of the signaling domains, the physiological role of the ATPase activity of RIG-I and MDA 5 remains controversial. ResultsA cross-analysis of a rationally designed <b>panel</b> of RNA <b>binding</b> and ATPase mutants and truncated receptors, using type I IFN promoter activation as readout, allows us to refine our understanding of the structure-function relationships of RIG-I and MDA 5. RNA activation of RIG-I depends on multiple critical RNA binding sites in its helicase domain as confirmed by functional evidence using novel mutations. We found that RIG-I or MDA 5 mutants with low ATP hydrolysis activity exhibit constitutive activity but this was fully reverted when associated with mutations preventing RNA binding to the helicase domain. We propose that the turnover kinetics of the ATPase domain enables the discrimination of self/non-self RNA by both RIG-I and MDA 5. Non-cognate, possibly self, RNA binding would lead to fast ATP turnover and RNA disassociation and thus insufficient time for the caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) to promote downstream signaling, whereas tighter cognate RNA binding provides a longer time window for downstream events to be engaged. ConclusionsThe exquisite fine-tuning of RIG-I and MDA 5 RNA-dependent ATPase activity coupled to CARD release allows a robust IFN response from a minor subset of non-self RNAs within a sea of cellular self RNAs. This avoids the eventuality of deleterious autoimmunity effects as have been recently described to arise from natural gain-of-function alleles of RIG-I and MDA 5...|$|R
40|$|At the {{inception}} of the World trade organization (WTO) in 1995, the organization's provisions for a formal dispute settlement mechanism under the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU) stood out as state of the “art”, “crown” and “jewels” of the WTO. Fifteen years later on, an assessment of the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) ’s judicial records shows that the system has indeed reduced the role of international diplomacy, while strengthening the rule of law in dispute settlement. The WTO-DSU’s independent Appellate Body, strict deadlines within which to settle disputes and <b>binding</b> <b>panel</b> recommendations certainly supersede the 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) dispute settlement system. To date, 400 disputes have been lodged before the Dispute Settlement Body leading to establishment of over 140 panels and adoption of 218 panel/Appellate Body reports. However, what these statistics fail to show {{is the fact that the}} DSM is dominated by leading industrialized countries, notably the European Communities and the United States, at the expense of developing countries. The European communities and the United States in particular are said to be employing the DSU to achieve their aspirations in international trade. This arises from their retaliatory capacity to threaten weaker respondents from pursuing disputes against them among other reasons. It follows that despite of the uniqueness and widely recognized efficacy, the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism has largely failed to address the needs of developing/ least developed countries, especially in Africa. The system’s lack of meaningful remedies, lack of transparency and general insensitivity to the development concerns of African countries have worked to alienate African states from the dispute settlement process. The said shortcomings in the pattern and structure of the DSU have also been noted from all corners of WTO membership including the original architects of the System like India, Brazil and Australia. In light of the above, this research paper analyzes the process of dispute settlement at the WTO, with special emphasis on the nature of remedies available to parties under the DSU. The research identifies pertinent areas for reform in the DSU and the DSB as a whole. The research arrives at practical measures/alternatives that African countries could adopt in order to enhance participation in dispute settlement at the WTO. The research points out that WTO law is tailored through interpretation of covered agreements and precedents and that participation in the WTO dispute settlement system is therefore crucial to the shaping of WTO law in the long run. In the end, African countries (forming a large percentage of WTO Membership) have not made use of the dispute settlement mechanism despite their trade being affected by the protectionist trade policies of their developed counterparts. If the majority of WTO membership cannot access the DSM, then the WTO objective of enhancing security and predictability of the multilateral trading system remains fictitious. This research therefore adds to the voice of many that the amendment of the DSU is long overdue. Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010. Centre for Human Rightsunrestricte...|$|R
40|$|In 2015 / 2016, the Flag Consideration Project {{provided}} an opportunity for New Zealanders to change the national flag, and while the change of flag did not come into effect, the texts distributed by the Flag Consideration Panel are worthy of examination because they {{provide insight into the}} contemporary conceptualisation of New Zealand?s national identity. The purpose of the research was to examine the construction of national identity in Aotearoa - New Zealand in two texts distributed by the Flag Consideration <b>Panel</b> before the <b>binding</b> referenda. A national flag is a symbol of identity used by citizens to remind them of their origins (Billig, 1995; Schatz & Lavine, 2007) and reinforce boundaries of belonging (Cerulo, 1993; Weitman, 1973). Accordingly, because it functions as a construction of the nation, changing the national flag could enhance or limit citizens? ability to identify with the country (Anderson, 1991; Billig, 1995; Cerulo, 1995; Elgenius, 2011; Hobsbawm, 1992; A. D. Smith, 2007; W. Smith, 2001), as well as influence perceptions of the nation internationally, based on the embedded meaning and symbolism of the design (Elgenius, 2004, 2007; Firth, 1973). Following this the research unpacks how national identity is constructed in official texts guided by the question: how has the Flag Consideration Panel conceptualised New Zealand?s national identity? Two texts were analysed following Fairclough?s (1992) three-dimensional model for critical discourse analysis to provide insight into how New Zealand?s national identity was discursively constructed. The first text titled 5 Alternatives, provided information about the five alternative designs that were part of the first referendum, with official and designer?s descriptions as well as illustrations of the designs in context. The second text, Our nation. Your choice., offered a comparison between the preferred alternative flag, the Silver Fern flag, and the current New Zealand flag. This method of analysis allowed for a consideration of the way power relations, hegemony and ideology are hidden and embedded within discourse (Fairclough, 1992), which was significant because national identity is considered ?a battle for hegemony? (Billig, 1995, p. 27). Despite the Panel?s intention to inform (Burrows, 2015 c), the analysis revealed instances of persuasion where the silver fern flag was constructed in a more favourable light and New Zealanders were encouraged to accept the Panel?s construction of national identity. There were asymmetrical power relationships between the Panel and New Zealanders through the Panel categorically asserting a particular version of national identity and providing a dominant reading of the flags, which privileged their voice over New Zealanders individual interpretation. This undermined the democratic potential of the texts to contribute to the discussion about the national flag and national identity in the public sphere. Although the flag did not change {{as a result of the}} referenda, the two texts examined reveal the Panel has constructed for New Zealand an identity that emphasises inclusiveness, independence and distinctiveness and therefore implies that the current New Zealand flag is inadequate in representing contemporary New Zealand...|$|R
40|$|Prostate cancer (PCa) is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} adenocarcinoma and the second highest cause of cancer-related deaths in men. Early diagnosis is required to identify the development of PCa {{to reduce the risk}} of the disease metastasising to different regions of the body. Multiple biomarkers in serum have been identified for the diagnosis of PCa. However, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and its isoforms remain the gold standard test for PCa detection. Many antibodies have been generated for the detection of PSA with good sensitivities and limits of detection. To ensure reliable assay performance a number of biomarkers for PCa are required to increase specificity and sensitivity thus reducing the number of false positive results upon initial examination. The overall aims of the work presented in this thesis were to generate, select and characterise antibodies to PSA, an important biomarker in PCa. The generation and selection of murine and avian recombinant antibody fragments to free PSA (fPSA) was performed. Animals were immunised, RNA extracted and cDNA synthesised. The antibody variable genes were amplified by PCR, gel-purified and cloned into a phagemid vector. Electrocompetent cells were transformed and library sizes of 2. 02 x 106 cfu/mL and 3. 10 x 108 cfu/mL were obtained for the murine and avian clones, respectively. Specific clones were isolated by ‗biopanning‘ which involved a selection process on fPSA-coated immunotubes, enrichment and affinity maturation. Five and three rounds of selection were performed on the murine and avian anti-fPSA single chain variable fragments (scFv) recombinant antibody libraries, respectively. Preliminary analysis by ELISA indicated a large <b>panel</b> of positive <b>binding</b> clones for both screened libraries with approximately 60 % of the analysed clones binding to fPSA. The murine recombinant antibody fragments were reformatted and expressed as single chain antibodies (scAb). This construct greatly enhanced soluble protein expression and stability while also facilitating the rapid kinetic analysis of candidate antibodies by Biacore. A differential expression profile of an anti-fPSA scFv and reformatted scAb was performed by ELISA. Individual antibodies isolated from the ‗biopanning‘ process were then characterised. The murine anti-fPSA antibodies were further analysed using the Biacore 3000 in a capture assay format. This facilitates correct affinity ranking of the selected antibodies where the antibody fragment was captured using the appropriate secondary tag antibody (anti-human constant kappa Ab) and a fixed concentration of fPSA (1 g/mL) passed over the captured antibody fragment. Ninety four antibody fragments were evaluated and ranked on their percentage complex stability values after a 5 minute dissociation period. Eleven of the ninety four were subjected to further analysis and their affinities ranged from 3. 99 x 10 - 9 M to 3. 62 x 10 - 10 M. They were then expressed in host Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells on a large scale and purified by immobilised metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). The cell lysates were characterised by ELISA, SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The antibodies were sequenced and analysed for variability and similarities between the coding regions of the variable domains. Inhibition ELISA-based assays with inter and intra-day analysis were performed on the purified antibodies and a reproducible and accurate assay format was demonstrated with a limit of detection of 2. 6 ng/mL. The avian clones were analysed, ranked and affinities evaluated by Dr. Paul Leonard using the Biacore A 100 employing the same assay format used for analysis of the murine antibody fragments. Imperative to assay design is the selection of optimal antibody candidates for improved performance. For assay development antibody pairs which bind different regions of the fPSA molecule were determined using the capture assay format on the Biacore 3000. One murine scAb, two avian Fabs and one avian scFv were shown to bind different epitopes of the fPSA molecule with no non-specific binding evident. Following the successful purification of the murine and avian antibody fragments immunohistochemistry studies were performed on PCa tissue samples. These antibodies were shown to bind to different zones of the prostate gland (epithelial and stromal regions) confirming that the antibodies were binding to different epitopes of the fPSA molecule. The purified murine anti-fPSA scAb was biotinylated and this was employed in a sandwich ELISA assay whereby the murine anti-fPSA biotinylated scAb was captured on a neutravidin-coated ELISA plate and fPSA sandwiched using the avian antibody fragments as the detection antibodies. The assay sensitivity was improved using this format with a limit of detection of 1. 8 ng/mL in PBST solution. Female serum was spiked with fPSA and inter-day studies performed by sandwich ELISA. Patient serum samples with diagnosed PCa were evaluated by sandwich ELISA to determine levels of fPSA in the sample and data were compared to documented tPSA levels which were comparable to the levels obtained from a commercially available sandwich assay...|$|R
