40|$|The {{possibility}} of a rapid collapse in {{the strength of the}} Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), with associated impacts on climate, has long been recognized. The suggested basis for this risk is the existence of two stable regimes of the AMOC (‘on’ and ‘off’), and such bistable behaviour has been identified in a range of simplified climate models. However, up to now, no state-of-the-art atmosphere-ocean coupled global climate model (AOGCM) has exhibited such behaviour, leading to the interpretation that the AMOC is more stable than simpler models indicate. Here we demonstrate AMOC bistability in the response to freshwater perturbations in the FAMOUS AOGCM - the most complex AOGCM to exhibit such behaviour to date. The results also support recent suggestions that the direction of the net freshwater transport at the southern boundary of the Atlantic by the AMOC may be a useful <b>physical</b> <b>indicator</b> of the existence of bistability. We also present new estimates for this net freshwater transport by the AMOC from a range of ocean reanalyses which suggest that the Atlantic AMOC is currently in a bistable regime, although with large uncertainties. More accurate observational constraints, and an improved physical understanding of this quantity, could help narrow uncertainty in the future evolution of the AMOC and to assess the risk of a rapid AMOC collapse...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study was}} to provide data on localization, intensity and frequency of adolescent spinal pain and to investigate which physical and psycho-social parameters predict these pain characteristics. METHOD: On the occasion of Spine Day, an annual event where children and adolescents are examined by chiropractors on a voluntary basis for back problems, 412 adolescents (10 to 16  years) were tested (by questionnaire and physical examination). Pain characteristics (localization, intensity, and frequency) were identified and evaluated using descriptive statistics. Regression analyses were performed to investigate possible influencing psycho-social and physical influence factors. RESULTS: Adolescents who suffered from pain in more than one spinal area reported higher pain intensity and frequency than those with pain in only one spinal area. Sleep disorders were a significant predictor for pain in more than one spinal area (p[*]<[*] 0. 01) as well as a trend for frequent pain (p[*]=[*] 0. 06). Adolescents with frequent pain showed impaired balance on one leg standing with closed eyes (p[*]=[*] 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: Studies on adolescent spinal pain should report data on pain frequency, intensity and localization.

The standard methods to measure water-stable aggregates (WSA) in soil involve sieving, but these have limitations that could be overcome if the aggregates were measured with a laser granulometer (LG) instrument. We present a novel method in which a LG is used to make two measurements of the continuous size distribution (< 2000 µm) of a sample of aggregates. The first measurement is made on the WSA after these {{have been added to}} circulating water (initial air-dried aggregate size range 1000 – 2000 µm). The second measurement is made on the disaggregated material (DM) after the circulating aggregates have been disrupted with ultrasound (sonication).

Soils with more stable aggregates, which are resistant to both slaking and mechanical breakdown by the hydrodynamic forces during circulation, have larger values of DR. We applied this method to six and ten sub-samples, respectively, of soil aggregates (each ca. 0. 3 g) from bulk soil material from two contrasting soil types from England, both under conventional tillage (CT).

We propose prediction scenarios and the results show that: (1) over the last 60 years, the per capita EF increasingly fluctuated while the per capita BC constantly reduced, and since 1985, China has had an aggregate ecological deficit (ED); (2) the business-as-usual scenario looked at the consequences if average annual change rates of per capita EF and BC are constant, where the per capita ED would be 3. 9024 gha in 2030, a very grim situation for China; and (3) if the productivity of natural ecosystems increases by 10 %, consumption of natural ecosystems and emission of CO 2 and contamination could be reduced by 10 % and per capita ED would be 1. 5217 gha in 2030, then the potential for sustainable development will be much better than the business-as-usual scenario.

Within the tropics, the best <b>physical</b> <b>indicator</b> of a fish ery's potential yield is water depth, and the best biological indicator is primary productivity.

However, no single indicator, including primary productivity, can predict fish yields very precisely.

40|$|Supporting the {{lifestyles of}} the populations of modern cities {{requires}} vast quantities {{of natural resources and}} leads to environmental stresses such as air and water pollution. Research into the metabolism of cities therefore aims at understanding the physical flows into, within, and out of cities with a view to reducing the use of resources and the environmental impacts. One important <b>physical</b> <b>indicator</b> is energy use. Most studies on cities only consider direct or end-user energy consumption. Since the function of cities is to serve the lives of their residents, indirect energy use in cities, or energy embodied in the consumption of goods and services by its residents, can be regarded as being as important as direct energy use. However, physical models of cities are extremely complex and have difficulty in dealing with boundary issues, and hence the indirect resource requirements. In this paper we use input–output analysis and detailed household expenditure data to yield comprehensive energy use breakdowns for the 14 Statistical Subdivisions of Sydney. Multivariate regression and structural path analysis (SPA) are used to interpret the results. Clear correlations can be drawn between energy use and income, household size, age, and degree of urbanity. The structural path analysis is used to demonstrate how significant differences in lifestyles between inner and outer areas of Sydney leads to different energy use characteristics.

40|$|The {{ecological}} footprint (EF), a <b>physical</b> <b>indicator</b> {{to measure the}} extent of humanity's use of natural resources, has gained much attention since it was first used by Wackernagel and Rees in 1996. In order to account for differences between countries in productivity of a given land type (i. e., arable land, pasture, forest and water/fishery), productivity factor was introduced to relate the regional primary bio-productivities of the 4 types of land to the integrated average primary bio-productivity of the corresponding land types. Hence, the productivity factor is an important parameter in the EF model and it directly affects the reliability of all results. Thus, this article calculates productivity factor on the national and provincial level in China based on Net Primary Production (NPP) from MODIS 1 km data in 2008. Firstly, based on the Light Utility Efficiency and CASA model, the NPP of different biologically productive lands of China and of different provinces was calculated. Secondly, China's productivity factor for a given land type was calculated as the ratio of national average NPP of that land type and world-average NPP of that land type. Finally, productivity factors of each province in China for a given land type was calculated. The NPP of each ecosystem type varies along with the productivity factor in different provinces. However, the ranking of the productivity factors remain the same, with that of arable land being the largest, and the water/fishery being the smallest. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Digital image analysis and either low-magnification dark-field, high-magnification phase-contrast, or confocal laser microscopy, {{in conjunction with}} pulse application of a 1. 5 M NaCl solution, were used as a rapid, growth-independent method for quantifying the viability of attached biofilm bacteria. Bacteria were considered viable if they were capable of plasmolysis, as quantified by changes in cell area or light scattering. When viable Salmonella enteritidis biofilm cells were exposed to 1. 5 M NaCl, an approximately 50 % reduction in cell protoplast area (as determined by high-magnification phase-contrast microscopy) was observed. In contrast, heat- and formalin-killed S. enteritidis cells were unresponsive to NaCl treatment. Furthermore, the mean dark-field cell area of a viable, sessile population of Pseudomonas fluorescens cells (approximately 1, 100 cells) increased by 50 % {{as a result of}} salt stress, from 1, 035 +/- 162 to 1, 588 +/- 284 microns 2, because of increased light scattering of the condensed, plasmolyzed cell protoplast.
