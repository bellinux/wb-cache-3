5|$|After a {{temporary}} closure between October 1951 and January 1952, British Railways (the {{successor to the}} LNER) ended passenger services between Finsbury Park and Alexandra Palace permanently on 3 July 1954. British Rail freight traffic continued {{to pass through the}} station until 1964. After freight traffic ceased, the line continued to be used for occasional London Underground rolling stock transfers between Highgate depot and the Northern City line, with the stock being <b>pulled</b> <b>over</b> the unelectrified lines by battery locomotives. This ceased in 1970 because of the poor condition of some of the intermediate bridges, and the track was lifted through the surface platforms in 1972.|$|E

5|$|By late 1943, Miller {{has been}} based at RAF South Cerny in Gloucestershire. One night, he was <b>pulled</b> <b>over</b> by his {{commanding}} officer, whom he detested, for not wearing his uniform cap. An altercation resulted, and Miller posed {{as though he were}} about to punch his officer. The result was that Miller was charged with insubordination and sentenced to a three-week disciplinary course with hard labour, from 18 October to 9 November. In mid-November he was posted to Ouston near Newcastle upon Tyne where he was trained in the use of radar using Anson and Oxford aircraft. During his stay there, Miller was thrown on his back during a wrestling match, sustaining an injury that caused him recurring problems in later years, diminishing his ability to bowl.|$|E

Toth, who was driving, was found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.139 and {{was arrested and charged with}} driving under the influence and failing to maintain a lane. Witherspoon was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for disobeying the arresting officer's instructions to remain in the vehicle and arguing with him, asking if he knew who she was. Witherspoon pleaded no contest and was fined $313, including court costs.|$|E
5|$|Her {{appearances}} {{became more}} regular from July 2014 onwards, with her stepping up her blackmail and revealing Ian's actions to Denise's protective father figure, Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker). In August 2014, Ian's friend Mick Carter, played by Danny Dyer, <b>pulled</b> <b>over</b> behind Ian and Rainie {{when he spotted}} them talking. Ian drove off and Rainie approaches Mick, believing {{him to be a}} customer of her prostitute services. The police then pulled up behind Mick, and arrested him for soliciting. When Ian explained Rainie's blackmail, Mick agreed to cover for him, {{to ensure the safety of}} his fake alibi. As a result of this, Rainie was reconciled with her mother, Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), as Cora supported Mick's wife Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) in court before bumping into her daughter. Rainie wants nothing to do with Cora, and pretends the allegations against Mick are true.|$|E

5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted ninety minutes each; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. Mercedes conducted race simulations {{to see how the}} cars would behave with a heavy fuel load. Rosberg was fastest in the first practice session with a lap time of one minute and 35.461 seconds, ahead of teammate Hamilton in second. Alonso was third-fastest, ahead of Bottas and Kimi Räikkönen. Magnussen, Ricciardo, Button and Daniil Kvyat rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Verstappen's run ended early when he <b>pulled</b> <b>over</b> {{to the side of the}} track at the S curves with smoke billowing from his engine because of a broken exhaust valve, and Merhi spun at turn 13 (causing Bottas to swerve to avoid him).|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} home, Homer remains {{oblivious to}} Ned's animosity. He {{arrives at the}} Flanders' house expecting to play golf, but Ned and his family get in their car and race off without him. <b>Pulled</b> <b>over</b> by Chief Wiggum for speeding, Ned takes a sobriety test as disapproving townspeople watch. At church, when the entire congregation bow their heads in prayer, Homer inhales very loudly through his nose, causing Ned to yell at Homer. This alarms the congregation, who become even more upset with Ned. But Homer sticks up for Ned and convinces the congregation to give him another chance. The next week, everything returns to normal, as Homer once again is annoyed by Ned.|$|E

40|$|Clump weights come {{in several}} shapes, {{with a mass}} {{generally}} between 2 to 9 tons [5]. With extensive oshore development in the last decades, vast networks of pipelines are installed on the sea bottom. With both pipeline extension and trawl equipment development in mind, the need for designing pipelines able to resist forces from trawl gear interaction have emerged. A recommended practice for pipeline design, DNV-RP-F 111, was established by DNV. In this master thesis, a brief introduction to trawl gear and recommended practices are given. The main objective of the master thesis is to reproduce model tests numerically and analyse the response from clump weight over-trawling pipelines. Evidence is sought to establish and dierentiate between the importance of various parameters, e. g free span height, pipeline diameter, and pipe end conditions. Several sensitivity studies were performed, with alterations in several parameters, e. g warp line angle alteration and clump weight wobbling. A full scale pipeline model was also analysed, investigating eects of exibility in pipelines and comparing the results with design loads. All analyses are performed in SIMLA, a special purpose non-linear nite element program. A general description of non-linear nite element method {{is included in the}} report. All input values used to model the dierent cases are presented in the master thesis. A good correspondence linking model test results and reproduced simulated models were generally achieved, with some deviations. The deviations are primarily found for low free spans, indicating that this discrepancy can be reduced by further development of the numerical model, e. g by introducing friction to the model. For the full scale pipeline model, design loads are evidently higher than vii viii the <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> force from the corresponding full scale simulation. When comparing design loads with <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> forces from simulated experimental test models, they are more closely related. For small diameter pipelines, a simulation in a full scale model, compared to the rigid model simulations, reduce the <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> forces signicantly. Sensitivity simulations indicate a connection between free span height, pipeline diameter and <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> force. For high free spans, the simulated <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> force increase with decreasing pipe diameter. For low free spans, the simulated <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> force decrease when decreasing the pipe diameter. Clump weight wobbling have in the master thesis been shown to reduce the <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> force. This is seen in the sensitivity analyses performed. Changing clump weight geometry can lead to signicant changes in results. An alteration of the warp line bracket was performed, extending the bracket with 4 cm. The eect was an reduction in the <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> force by approximately 10 %, in all cases. A change in warp line angle was also performed, by increasing and then decreasing the angle with 20 %. The eect was an reduction in <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> force by 10 % and an increase in <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> force by approximately 10 %, respectively. For further details regarding the results, see chapter 5. </p...|$|R

5|$|After rescuing Camille from Medrano, Bond follows Greene to a {{performance}} of Tosca in Bregenz, Austria. Meanwhile, {{the head of the}} CIA's South American section, Gregg Beam (David Harbour), strikes a noninterference deal with Greene for access to putative stocks of Bolivian oil. Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, identifying members of Quantum's executive board, and a gunfight ensues. A Special Branch bodyguard working for Quantum member Guy Haines (Paul Ritter), is killed by antagonists after Bond throws him off a roof. M assumes Bond killed him, and has Bond's passports and credit cards revoked. Bond heads to Italy and convinces his old ally René Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) to accompany him to Bolivia. They are greeted by Strawberry Fields (Gemma Arterton), a consular employee who demands Bond return to the UK immediately. Bond seduces her and they attend a fundraising party Greene holds that night. At the party, Bond again rescues Camille from Greene. Leaving, Bond and Camille are <b>pulled</b> <b>over</b> by Bolivian police working for Medrano. They had earlier attacked Mathis and put him in the boot of Bond's car to frame Bond. In the ensuing struggle, Mathis and the cops are killed.|$|E
5|$|Further down, Ralf Schumacher took Zonta for {{eleventh}} {{place and}} Diniz passed teammate Salo for 14th position. Barrichello caught de la Rosa by lap twelve and passed {{him to take}} fourth and started to come under pressure from Frentzen. Herbert <b>pulled</b> <b>over</b> {{to the side of}} the track with gearbox problems on lap 13. Barrichello passed Trulli for third position at the second corner two laps later. Barrichello became the first driver to make a pit stop by coming in on lap 17. Frentzen made his pit stop one lap later and re-joined in sixth place. By lap 20, Häkkinen had a lead of 1.4 seconds over Coulthard, who in turn was almost 22 seconds ahead of Trulli. de la Rosa was a further 2.1 seconds behind Trulli, and was being caught by Barrichello in fifth who set a new fastest lap, a 1:44.300. Villeneuve overtook Irvine to claim eighth place on lap 22.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Alonso set the fastest lap {{of the day}} with a time of 1:39.283; Red Bull drivers Vettel and Webber finished with the second and third-fastest times. Rosberg was fourth, ahead of Hamilton and Kubica. Massa, Adrian Sutil, Button and Barrichello followed in the top-ten. Massa caused the session to be disrupted after spinning in the fourth corner and narrowly avoided making contact with the barrier. The session was red-flagged to allow Massa's car to be removed from the centre of the track to be taken to the pit lane. Timo Glock's lost the use of his car's fifth gear and <b>pulled</b> <b>over</b> {{to the side of the}} track at turn twelve which prematurely ended his running. Vitaly Petrov spun at the exit of turn 14 and reversed his car to rejoin the circuit, avoiding the need for a red-flag. Vettel was the fastest driver in the final practice session with a lap of 1:38.052; Webber was third-fastest. Kubica separated the two Red Bull drivers in second, with Sutil fourth. Alonso was fifth-fastest, and Barrichello was sixth. Vitantonio Liuzzi, Massa, Button and Hamilton rounded out the top ten.|$|E
