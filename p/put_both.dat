5|$|Since Hairsprays plot focuses {{heavily on}} dance, choreography became a heavy focus for Shankman, who hired four {{assistant}} choreographers, Jamal Sims, Anne Fletcher, and Zach Woodlee, and <b>put</b> <b>both</b> his acting cast {{and over a}} hundred and fifty dancers through two months of rehearsals. The cast recorded the vocal tracks for their songs as coached by Elaine Overholt in the weeks just before principal photography began in September.|$|E

5|$|Early in the race, Trousselier, François Faber and Emile Georget {{were the}} main contenders. Trousselier, winner of the 1905 Tour de France and eager to win again, won the first stage. In the second stage, the Tour passed the French-German border to finish in Metz, which was then part of Germany. The German {{authorities}} allowed the cyclists to finish there, but did not allow the French flag to be flown or the cars of race officials to enter the city. At {{the end of the}} stage, Emile Georget seemingly beat Trousselier with a very small margin. After inquiry, Desgrange, the Tour's organiser, decided to <b>put</b> <b>both</b> cyclists in first place, to keep both sponsors satisfied.|$|E

5|$|New manager Craig Brown {{successfully}} guided Scotland to the 1996 European Championship tournament. The {{first game}} against the Netherlands ended 0–0, raising morale ahead of a much anticipated game against England at Wembley. Gary McAllister missed a penalty kick, and a goal by Paul Gascoigne led to a 2–0 defeat. Scotland recovered to beat Switzerland 1–0 with a goal by Ally McCoist. England taking a 4–0 lead in the other match briefly <b>put</b> <b>both</b> teams {{in a position to}} qualify, but a late goal for the Netherlands meant that Scotland were knocked out on goals scored.|$|E
5|$|Unsurprisingly, Ostapchuk {{was against}} Alliance Atlantis’s plans for Whyte Avenue, believing {{that it would}} <b>put</b> <b>both</b> the Garneau and the Princess out of business. The Old Strathcona Foundation sided with Magic Lantern, and fought the plans. The {{argument}} {{went all the way}} to Edmonton City Council, which was asked to waive Old Strathcona’s four-story height limit for the six-story multiplex. Council sided against Alliance Atlantis when Councillor Terry Cavanagh changed his vote at the last minute, defeating the motion 6-5.|$|E
5|$|Kemper then <b>put</b> <b>both</b> of the women's {{bodies in}} the trunk of his Ford Galaxie and {{returned}} to his apartment, being stopped on the way by a police officer for a broken taillight but managing not to be detected for his more serious offences. His roommate was not at home, so he took the bodies into his apartment, where he took pornographic photographs of, and had sex with, the naked corpses before dismembering them. He then put the body parts into plastic bags, which he later abandoned near Loma Prieta Mountain. Before disposing of Pesce's and Luchessa's severed heads in a ravine, Kemper engaged in irrumatio with both of them. In August, Pesce's skull was found up on Loma Prieta Mountain. An extensive search failed to turn up the rest of her remains or a trace of her companion.|$|E

25|$|Although {{their first}} major {{confrontation}} {{occurred when the}} Mets swept the Braves in the 1969 NLCS, en route to their first World Series championship, the first playoff series won by an expansion team (also the first playoff appearance by an expansion team), the rivalry did not become especially heated until the 1994 season when division realignment <b>put</b> <b>both</b> the Mets and the Braves in the NL East division. During this time the Braves {{became one of the}} most dominant teams in professional baseball, earning 14 straight division titles through 2005, including five world series berths, and one world series championship during the 1995 season. The rivalry remained heated through the early 2000s.|$|E

For ten days, the astronauts <b>put</b> <b>both</b> Apollo spacecraft through their paces in Earth orbit, including an undocking and redocking of the lunar lander with the command vehicle, just as the landing mission crew would perform in lunar orbit. Apollo 9 gave proof that the Apollo spacecraft were up to this critical task, on which the lives of lunar landing crews would depend.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} women’s {{education}} {{to be as}} equal as the men’s in Ivory Coast, the government must provide more schools for free, so that the people don’t think about financial issues once they put their child at school, and so the parents can afford to <b>put</b> <b>both</b> {{their sons and daughters}} in school. Education is free in Ivory Coast, but the parents must provide the school supplies, which might be a challenge if they have more than one child (Our Africa). This might lessen the need for women to go to school. For this to happen, the people must inform the government and if they refuse, protest. Education is a basic right everyone should afford, no matter the gender.|$|E

25|$|This was {{followed}} by three consecutive losses {{in the first round}} of qualifying for WTA events before Baltacha won two matches to qualify for the Rogers Cup, a Premier tournament. She faced former world number 1, Kim Clijsters, in the second tournament of her comeback and lost to the Belgian in straight sets. Following this, she reached the final round of qualifying for the US Open before going on to win the $75,000 ITF in Shrewsbury. She beat fellow Brit, Katie O'Brien, in the final. This result was enough to <b>put</b> <b>both</b> finalists into the top 100 for the first time in each of their careers. After this, Baltacha reached the semifinals of one more $50,000 ITF, the second round of a $100,000 ITF (where she had to withdraw due to food poisoning) and the quarterfinals of a $75,000 ITF tournament. These showings helped her accumulate enough points to catapult her back to the British number 1 spot. Her year-end ranking was world number 87.|$|E
25|$|Booth {{followed}} up his first career defeat with victory {{back at home}} beating Mark Reynolds in Coventry before getting a fight with the current holder of the British and Commonwealth flyweight titles Keith Knox. The fight due {{to take place in}} Belfast on 16 October 1999 would have both titles on the line with Booth eventually winning in the 10th round. The new champion defended his Commonwealth title first when in January 2000 he beat South African Abbey Mnisi. In November 2000 he <b>put</b> <b>both</b> titles on the line when defending against 8-0 prospect Ian Napa eventually winning a 12-round unanimous decision. In February 2001, he made the second defence of his Commonwealth belt knocking out Zimbabwean, Nogthula Tshabangu at the Harvey Hadden Leisure Centre in Nottingham. Booth's brother, Nicky, was also on the bill and defeated Adey Lewis with a seventh round stoppage to crown a good night for the brothers and a unique one in British boxing history in that {{it was the first time}} that two siblings had defended titles on the same night.|$|E

On February 16, they {{defeated}} Van Hammer & The Cowboy in a rematch on MCW Rage TV in Harrington, Delaware but lost to Gillberg & Steve Wilkos of the Jerry Springer Show at Michael's Eighth Avenue in Glen Burnie a month later. In his pro wrestling debut, Wilkos <b>put</b> <b>both</b> {{men in the}} sleeperhold to get the victory. The Slackers bounced back by winning the MCW Tag Team Championship from The Badstreet Boys on the May 22nd edition of Rage TV. The team defended the titles against The S.A.T. (Jose & Joel Maximo) at the 2002 Shane Shamrock Memorial Cup as well as The Briscoe Brothers (Jay and Mark Briscoe) and The Holy Rollers (Earl The Pearl & Ramblin Rich) {{during the next few}} months.
