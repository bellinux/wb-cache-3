5000|$|IMTS {{base station}} sites {{generally}} covered an area 40-60 miles in diameter. This extended range {{was due to}} both their large transmitter power {{and in many cases}} higher antenna placement at anywhere from 100-500 ft. IMTS base stations in larger cites had as many as 7 or 8 channels while rural stations had as few as one or two channels. Each telephone conversation (connection) required the exclusive use of a channel for the duration. Because of this limitation these systems had a much lower capacity than cellular systems and all channels <b>busy</b> <b>conditions</b> were common. In larger cities this dictated a very limited number of simultaneous calls. Each subscriber was given a packet of dialing and use instructions. Roaming (receiving calls out of the [...] "home area") was achieved by selecting the specific channels used by the tower and service provider the user was traveling in and dialing a three-digit code, thereby logging the user's land number at that location. This process had to be repeated at each tower which, as noted, usually had a range of 40-60 miles. Some areas only had half-duplex (one-way) communications and required the push-to-talk switch in the handset, between the mouthpiece and the earpiece. Two lights on the [...] "head" [...] indicated busy (red) if no channels were idle and in-use (green) if connected to the tower, or depressing the push-to-talk switch.

30|$|In recent years, {{many studies}} {{have been made to}} analyze the {{transmission}} performance over 802.11 WLAN. The authors in [7] analyze the performance of 802.11 taking into account the queue dynamics of a wireless station and the general probability distribution of packet sizes, while in [8], an M/MMG 1 / 1 /K queuing model is developed to reduce the complexity level by effectively restoring the independence between the service time and the packet inter-arrival time. The paper [9] evaluates the performance of DCF in binary symmetric channels (BSCs), concurrently considering factors such as the binary exponential backoff mechanism, the incoming traffic loads, and the distribution of incoming packet sizes. The paper [10] analyzes the delay and queue length characteristics following a discrete time G/G/ 1 queue model and assuming an arbitrary arrival pattern. The model is also extended for analyzing the performance of 802.11 e by considering the burst packet transmissions. To support quality of service (QoS) in real-time applications, the concept of critical real-time traffic condition is introduced in [11] to characterize the marginal satisfaction of the real-time requirements. None of the solutions above, however, considers the derivation of performance metrics that can meet the targeted QoS desired by real-time applications. In [12], the authors presented a network analysis model to calculate MAC access delay and throughput by using M/G/ 1 /K queuing model. Bianchi’s model [13] is simple and fairly accurate model. Authors proved that 802.11 e WLAN can guarantee QoS requirement of the real-time traffic as long as the network is tuned to operate in the non-saturated case and network traffic is not heavy. For saturated channel model, saturation throughput and computation of delay performance are analyzed by modifying channel <b>busy</b> <b>condition</b> and improving Ziouva and Antonakopoulous’s model in [14], the more accurate analysis of the DCF are presented.|$|R
40|$|As {{a growing}} {{presence}} in homes and schools, technology {{plays an important}} role in the way that children learn in their environment. The early integration of technology within education reflects the promise of computer-based educational tools to facilitate early learning in children (Grant, Wood, Gottardo, Evans, Phillips, 2 ̆ 6 Savage, 2012). Young learners are reported to be challenged with high levels of distractibility that can hinder their ability to learn in particular conditions and contexts (Fisher, Godwin, 2 ̆ 6 Seltman, 2014). This can be a problem when considering that educational materials are often designed to be elaborate to keep young learners interested. For this reason, the present study sought to determine the effect of visually “busy” versus visually “simpler” backgrounds during a video presentation meant to encourage the development of alphabetic knowledge. The participants recruited for this study included 20 preschoolers, 20 children in grade two, and 32 undergraduate students. Participants were presented with unfamiliar letter shapes (Arabic and Hebrew letters) in each of the two video contexts (busy and simpler). In order to test for differences in information retention and possible learning between the two displays, a forced-choice recognition task was used to compare between the two types of screens. To take into account individual differences, participants or their parents completed family literacy and technology use questionnaires, as well as were evaluated on literacy and vocabulary measures. Analyses included correlational analysis, descriptive statistics and multivariate analyses of variance. There was a main effect of age on performance overall. However, there were no significant differences between performance on the simpler and <b>busy</b> <b>conditions</b> for each age group. Lastly, literacy skill, vocabulary skill and technology use did not show significant relationships with performance on the letter learning task...|$|R
40|$|Cooling systems {{based on}} a {{continuous}} flow of fresh air are typically used in electronic devices. For applications in adverse environment such us underwater applications of industrial applications using air with {{a great amount of}} dust, hermetic devices are needed. The major problem when designing hermetic devices is to provide a proper cooling system. The cooling system of a hermetic device must meet two fundamental requirements: • Continuous airflow through all electronic components inside the case. • Enough heat transfer between the inside air and the outside environment. Non-hermetic systems are usually designed with the air inlet in the front, and the fans with the air outlet in the back. Using this configuration it is easy to warranty a correct airflow through the electronic components of the system (see Figure 1). This paper describes different alternatives for cooling hermetic devices. The study was done for a personal computer, evaluating the amount of heat produced during sleep <b>condition</b> and <b>busy</b> <b>condition.</b> Different cooling alternatives are presented: natural convection using standard radiators (for a noiseless system), and forced convection using radiators and fans. Both configurations are compared with the equivalent ones using thermoelectricity to increase the heat transfer between the inside of the hermetic box and the outside environment. It is demonstrated that without thermoelectricity, {{it is almost impossible to}} evacuate enough heat because the box of the PC has to be full of radiators. While applying the Peltier effect the heat transfer is highly increased. Figure 1 : Conventional equipment ventilation Hermetic devices use airflow to cool circuits, like conventional system, but also a set of internal ducts and heat exchangers.

40|$|Abstract Background Universal {{exclusive}} breastfeeding for {{the first}} six months could reduce infant mortality by 13 %. Although 99 % women initiate breastfeeding in Uganda, exclusive breastfeeding rates remain low. Although peer counsellors for support of breastfeeding mothers have been found useful in other countries, they have not been used in Uganda. The aim of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of training community based peer counsellors to support exclusive breastfeeding in a rural district in Uganda. Methods With assistance of the investigators, the local communities selected fifteen women aged 25 to 30 years. These women were trained for five days on breastfeeding counselling using the La Leche League curriculum. After training they returned to their communities and started supporting breastfeeding peers. They were followed up and supported in their work for three months. The programme was evaluated through focus group discussions with the peer counsellors, fathers and mothers. Results The trainees appreciated the knowledge gained and discussed cultural beliefs which affect breastfeeding. They offered breastfeeding support to 15 mothers each within the first two months. They found time to visit and help their breastfeeding <b>peers</b> despite <b>busy</b> schedules. They identified common breastfeeding problems as "insufficient breast milk", sore nipples, breast engorgement, mastitis and poor positioning at the breast. They further observed that most of these problems were eased by correct positioning of the baby at the breast. The peer counsellors were easily accepted by their communities. The mothers were happy to have someone within their community helping them with their breastfeeding problems. Although the peer counsellors were initially selected as volunteers, soon they demanded remuneration. Conclusion The training and follow up of peer counsellors to support exclusive breastfeeding in this rural district is feasible. The peer counsellors were accepted by their communities. </p...|$|R

However, the decisions taken in one area may influence the quality and even the feasibility of train schedules in the other areas. Regional control centers coordinate the dispatchers' work for multiple areas in order to regulate traffic {{at the global level}} and to avoid situations of global infeasibility. Differently from the dispatcher problem, the coordination activity of regional control centers is still underinvestigated, even if this activity is a key factor for effective traffic management. This paper studies the problem of coordinating several dispatchers with the objective of driving their behavior towards globally optimal solutions. With our model, a coordinator may impose constraints at the border of each dispatching area. Each dispatcher must then schedule trains in its area by producing a locally feasible solution compliant with the border constraints imposed by the coordinator. The problem faced by the coordinator is therefore a bilevel programming problem in which the variables controlled by the coordinator are the border constraints. We demonstrate that the coordinator problem can be solved to optimality with a branch and bound procedure. The coordination algorithm has been tested on a large real railway network in the Netherlands with <b>busy</b> traffic <b>conditions.</b> Our experimental results show that a proven optimal solution is frequently found for various network divisions within computation times compatible with real-time operations...|$|R

A final simulation was carried out to assess potential benefits using a prototype that reflected a culmination of previous design decisions. The simulation compared EDA against baseline operations in which controllers were provided with scheduling automation alone, representing metering operations today. For added fidelity, the simulation included models of trajectory prediction uncertainty. Results showed that EDA enabled a 92 % improvement in the accuracy by which controllers delivered aircraft to the terminal airspace boundary in conformance with metering schedules. In addition, with EDA, controllers were able to accommodate overtake maneuvers en route without adjustments to the optimal arrival sequence. Furthermore, EDA was shown to reduce fuel consumption in transition airspace by 110 lbs per flight, averaged for all aircraft types and traffic scenarios, with substantially more fuel savings observed for <b>busier</b> traffic <b>conditions</b> and larger aircraft types.

This study aims to: (1) identify young men's perceived motivators and barriers in adopting healthy eating and physical activity behaviours, and (2) explore any differences in responses by weight status categories. Methods: Ten focus groups (32 - 63 minutes; 3 - 9 participants per group) were conducted with 61 young men (BMI: 25. 3 ± 5. 1 kg/m², aged: 18 - 25 years) from the Hunter region, New South Wales, Australia. There were 35 (57. 4 %) healthy weight men and 26 (42. 6 %) overweight/ obese men. Three groups were with healthy weight participants, three with overweight/obese participants and four with mixed-BMI participants. Sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed. Data analysis was conducted by an independent researcher using NVIVO 10. Results: Motivators for healthy eating grouped into four themes: physical health (e. g. to live longer), sport or performance (e. g. to support their sporting goals), physical appearance (e. g. sexual attractiveness) and social influences (e. g. societal expectations to eat healthy), while key motivators for physical activity were: physical appearance (e. g. sexual attractiveness), social inclusion (e. g. making friends), physical and mental health (e. g. relieve stress) and improvements for sport or performance (e. g. improve fitness). Themes for key barriers to eating healthy were: intrinsic (e. g. perceived effort to adopt healthy eating), logistic (e. g. cost), and social factors (e. g. <b>peer</b> influence), while <b>busy</b> lifestyles (e. g. lack of time), logistic (e. g. cost), cognitive-emotional (e. g. feelings of inferiority) and social factors (e. g. family upbringing) were key barriers for physical activity.
