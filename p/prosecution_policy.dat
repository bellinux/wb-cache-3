40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades, {{corporate}} white-collar criminal defense and investigations practices have become established within the nation 2 ̆ 7 s largest law firms. It was not always this way. White-collar work was not considered a legal specialty. And, historically, lawyers in the leading civil firms avoided criminal matters. But several developments occurred at once: firms grew dramatically, the norms within the firms changed, and new federal crimes and <b>prosecution</b> <b>policies</b> created enormous business opportunities for the large firms. Using a unique data set, this Article profiles the Big Law partners now in the white-collar practice area, {{most of whom are}} male former federal prosecutors. With additional data and a case study, the Article explores the movement of partners from government and from other firms, the profitability of corporate white-collar work, and the <b>prosecution</b> <b>policies</b> that facilitate and are in turn affected by the growth of this lucrative practice within Big Law. These developments have important implications for the prosecution function, the wider criminal defense bar, the law firms, and women in public and private white-collar practices...|$|R

40|$|I {{investigate}} empirically {{the role}} of religion and political institutions in policies against human trafficking, using the new 3 P Anti-trafficking Policy Index. The dataset contains 175 countries. The results show that governments in countries with Christian majorities implement stricter anti-trafficking policies than countries with Muslim majorities. The differences between countries with Christian and Muslim majorities is pronounced in dictatorships but less so in democracies. The influence of religion on the overall 3 P Anti-trafficking Policy Index is driven by protection and prevention policies. As compared to <b>prosecution</b> <b>policies</b> that mainly target the perpetrators of human trafficking, protection and prevention policies mainly protect the victims of human trafficking, i. e. predominantly women.

40|$|According to the United Nations, over 2. 45 {{million people}} are victims of human trafficking, {{and the number of}} {{unrecorded}} cases is also believed to be significant. Therefore, many countries have increased their efforts to combat trafficking and to protect the victims. DIW Berlin recently updated the 3 P Anti-Trafficking Policy Index which facilitates an international comparison of government policy efforts in three areas: prosecution, (victim) protection, and prevention. The update of the Index now covers the period from 2000 to 2011. On a worldwide scale, countries have generally shown high commitment towards implementing <b>prosecution</b> <b>policies,</b> and the most significant improvements have been observed in preventive efforts.

40|$|In recent decades, {{arrest and}} {{prosecution}} {{have been applied}} to perpetrators of domestic violence with increasing severity, representing {{an important step in}} recognizing domestic violence as a crime.

50|$|In 2015 a {{case was}} brought against Saunders in the High Court. The Plaintiff, Nikki Kenward, argued that Saunders had amended <b>prosecution</b> <b>policy</b> {{outside of the}} {{democratic}} process. Saunders released the alleged amendment in October, 2014. In it she suggested that the guidelines on assisted suicide prosecution be understood such that a doctor who is not the patient's immediate care provider, should not be as likely to face prosecution as a doctor who is the patient's immediate care provider. This prompted a backlash from anti-assisted suicide groups who argued {{that this was a}} substantial change, which would allow for businesses similar to Dignitas to operate in the UK. Saunders defence was that she had only clarified the existing guidelines. Nevertheless, Kenward was granted the judicial review against Saunders in April, 2015.

40|$|The {{literature}} on mandatory charging and <b>prosecution</b> <b>policies</b> consistently finds that zero tolerance approaches to woman abuse often harm, rather than help, abused immigrant women. The unexpected removal of abusers triggers detrimental consequences if women {{are dependent on}} their partners for immigration status, financial assistance, and linguistic support. The violence that immigrant women experience {{at the hands of}} the police and courts has led to repeated calls to shift the responsibility of women abuse from the criminal justice system to the community. However, accessing community supports may not be so straightforward either. For a variety of reasons, many abused immigrant women find silence less risky than disclosing abuse. These dilemmas highlight the importance of acquiring more insight into the mediating role that community organizations perform between the criminal justice system and immigrant communities. Accordingly, the following exploratory study offers a glimpse into the antiviolence work of immigrant community organizations in Toronto, Ontario...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{number of}} fatalities, serious bodily {{injuries}} and high potential injuries is unsatisfactory according to community standards; {{people are still}} being killed and seriously injured on mine sites due to human behaviour factors, such as not complying with rules, procedures and management failings. This research aims to conduct {{an analysis of the}} Australian Mining Industry safety performance and make comparisons with international mining operations, examine the mine safety environment and determine the effects that culture, risk management, <b>prosecution</b> <b>policies,</b> fly in fly out, fatigue and mental health are having on safety improvement. In this regard, as a major part of this research, a field survey has been conducted in the Qld and NSW coal mining industry. A total of 37 mines participated in manual and electronic surveys and responses were received from over 1200 questionnaires. A statistical comparison of the two surveys has been conducted using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. This research has found that fatigue and awareness issues as well as travel times to work are having a major impact on safety at work, which is particularly evident when employees are working 12 hour shifts. The survey results show that {{there is a lack of}} experienced personnel in the industry and that the effective management of contractors continues to cause concern. This research has demonstrated that the current approach to prosecution is counter-productive, as it inhibits thorough safety investigation and creates a defensive rather than a no blame culture. It also prevents the sharing of safety information and heeding the lessons learned. It has been found that there is a lack of training in safety management systems, management influence effects the outcomes of risk assessments, accident investigation would be better without legal people’s involvement and an official inquiry would produce better outcomes if there was no fear of prosecution. This research has demonstrated that the safety performance in the Australian Mining Industry has not improved and may even be deteriorating and that in order to improve safety performance the mining industry needs to adopt the recommendations which have been made regarding culture, <b>prosecution</b> <b>policies,</b> training, risk assessments, shift lengths and fly in fly out operations...|$|R

40|$|The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) {{has taken}} steps to define and develop its <b>prosecution</b> <b>{{policies}}.</b> Review of these policies reveals that the OTP prefers to act on referrals of situations by states and the Security Council, rather than to employ its proprio motu investigatory powers. While the OTP has effectively defined the threshold for {{the gravity of the}} crimes that it will prosecute, a number of other discretionary criteria that inform the OTP's exercise of jurisdiction remain undefined. Additionally, the OTP's acceptance of state 'waivers of complementarity' moves in the direction of establishing a quasi-exclusive jurisdiction for the OTP. This thesis will critically evaluate these policies, and propose a recasting of the OTP's prosecution strategy towards the promotion of domestic war crimes prosecutions. It posits that the ICC OTP can act as a catalyst for domestic war crimes prosecutions, by serving in an advisory and support role. The OTP thus has the opportunity to breathe life into the complementarity regime and advance the global struggle against impunity...|$|R
40|$|What causes partner violence, {{and how do}} we end the “cycle {{of abuse}} ” and realize a vision of peace and reconciliation? This {{question}} {{is at the center of}} a heated debate over partner-perpetrated abuse and the efforts to stop it. Violent Partners is the third book in which Linda Mills presents her controversial answer. As in her pre-vious books, Mills argues that the project of stopping partner-perpetrated violence was derailed by misguided feminists who hijacked both the criminal justice and social services responses to abuse and violence in families. The first unfortunate result, Mills asserts, is the institutionalization of an overly protective approach to victims that disempowers women by focusing on escape, mandatory arrest, and no-drop <b>prosecution</b> <b>policies.</b> As most people want the abuse to stop without ending the relationship and stigmatizing or humiliating their partner, this approach fails to meet their needs. The second unfortunate result is an overly punitive approach to perpetrators that relies on retribution rather than rehabilitation and reconciliation. Criminalizing abusers does more harm than good and deters people from seeking help. From these perhaps well-meant but nevertheless devastating ideological an...|$|R
40|$|Arizona’s Senate Bill 1070 {{has focused}} {{attention}} on whether federal law preempts the prosecution of state immigration crime in local criminal courts. Absent from the current discussion, however, is an appreciation of how Arizona’s existing body of criminal immigration law—passed well before SB 1070 and currently in force in the state—functions {{on the ground to}} regulate migration. Drawing on statistical data, <b>prosecution</b> <b>policies,</b> trial-level court records, and interviews with stakeholders, this Article is the first to investigate the practice of local immigration prosecution. It does so in the hotbed of immigration enforcement—Maricopa County, Arizona—through a detailed case study of the implementation of a 2005 Arizona alien smuggling law. Specifically, this Article reveals four key aspects of the national immigration system that have shifted in the face of state criminalization: the functional definition of immigration crime, the breadth of state immigration enforcement authority, the allocation of federal resources for criminal prosecution, and the exercise of executive control over immigration policy. Through this analysis, this Article shows how Arizona, despite the formal prohibition on state and local immigration regulation, has redefined and restructured the federal system for punishing immigration crime. In so doing, this Article fosters a richer and more accurate understanding {{of the role of the}} local prosecutor in immigration federalism...|$|R

40|$|As primary implementers of laws {{on human}} trafficking, law {{enforcement}} helps construct how these laws are understood and applied. This article examines how {{this process has}} unfolded in Russia {{by looking at the}} phenomenon of and debates surrounding child trafficking for illegal adoption. It argues that pre-existing experience with trafficking laws and cultural narratives surrounding adoption have led law enforcement to focus on uncovering evidence of monetary transactions rather than exploitation when prosecuting trafficking cases. This construction of the meaning of trafficking comes with important trade-offs. While the emphasis on transactions helps law enforcement to be successful at prosecuting cases involving selling children for illegal adoption, a focus on transactions rather than exploitation results in a de facto <b>prosecution</b> <b>policy</b> that ignores the many forms of exploitation that occur in other trafficking cases...|$|E

The Rebels? takeover of power {{has led to the}} reinforcement of authoritarian regimes and has turned Eastern Congo into a place of intense confrontation in order to plunder its mineral resources. The study of judicial proceedings sparked off by mass crimes committed in Rwanda and in the territory of neighbouring states between  1994  and  2000  and a retrospective outlook on the work accomplished by the ICTR, leads one to acknowledge the great effort made to prosecute those responsible for the  1994  genocide and to establish the truth. However, this critical assessment also reveals the weaknesses of international criminal justice which, for political or diplomatic reasons, did not dare to prosecute alleged crimes by the victorious camp today in charge in Kigali. This special privilege of impunity is about to be widened to war crimes, crimes against humanity and alleged acts of genocide committed in RDC between  1996  and  2003.

40|$|JOHNSON: This {{presentation}} envisions what {{a better}} domestic violence legal system {{might look like}} for persons subjected to domestic abuse who have not had their needs met or who have been harmed by the current legal system. The paper reframes {{the focus of the}} civil legal system from a paradigm of safety into a paradigm of security, including economic, housing, health, and relationship security. This reframing permits a focus on the domestic violence legal system and its intersecting systems of oppression such as race, gender, class, and ethnicity. Currently, the domestic violence legal system targets short-term physical safety of the person subjected to abuse. This safety is accomplished through physical separation of the person who was subjected to abuse from the person who committed the abuse. For instance, this targeting exists in the mandatory criminal justice system 2 ̆ 7 s response to domestic violence with mandatory arrest and no drop <b>prosecution</b> <b>policies</b> and with the remedies available in the civil protection order, such as the stay away, no contact and ejectment from the home provisions. The goals of the domestic violence civil legal and funding policies should be to decrease domestic violence and to help persons subjected to abuse lead satisfied lives. To achieve this shift, we need to reframe the domestic violence policy and legal system from solely safety to security...|$|R

These criminal cases, brought against the largest Swiss bank (UBS), the oldest Swiss bank (Wegelin), {{one of the}} largest accounting firms in the world (KPMG), as well as numerous lawyers and accountants, represent a dramatic shift for the U.

40|$|We {{consider}} a stylized model {{of crime and}} punishment in which the <b>prosecution</b> <b>policy</b> is defined by three variables: the size of punishment, the type of punishment and the detection probability. We derive the optimal type of punishment {{under the assumption that}} the detection probability is chosen by a government official whose objective function places a higher weight on the government's budget than the social welfare function does. We show that for serious crimes exclusive imprisonment is welfare maximizing. If costs of imprisonment are taken into account, the optimal punishment is a prison term with an additional fine that is smaller or equal to the costs of the prison term. For less serious crimes, fines without imprisonment are welfare maximizing. Therefore, this paper demonstrates that the standard result of the literature that fines should be used whenever feasible need not hold in the presence of agency conflicts. Moreover, it offers a new economic explanation for the wide-spread use of mandatory imprisonment for serious crimes...|$|E
