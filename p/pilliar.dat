40|$|Three madreporic {{prostheses}} in {{two patients}} were examined to evaluate resorption and {{formation of the}} surrounding bone tissue. All three prostheses were firmly fixed and had no clinical or radiographic signs of loosening. Transverse sections were examined by scanning electron microscopy at 40 days, 1 1 months and 2. 5 years after implantation. The findings suggest that adaptive bone remodelling varies {{along the length of}} the stem; that bone resorption and formation are related to the time after implant; and that new bone formation (woven bone) can be found very close to the madreporic surface. Porous coating of orthopaedic implants, which aims to promote bone ingrowth after arthroplasty, offers a valuable alternative to fixation with acrylic cement. Animal experiments and clinical experience have sub-stantiated the view that bone grows into the spaces of porous-coated implants (Welsh, <b>Pilliar</b> and Macna...|$|E

As-formed coatings, layers or films are porous, less dense and have poor adhesion to the substrate. To improve their properties, the samples are annealed at temperatures of 400 °C to 1, 000 °C (Gross et al. 1998 c; Haddow et al. 1999; Montenero et al. 2000; Tkalcec et al. 2001; Liu et al. 2002 b; Metikoš-Huković et al. 2003; Kim et al. 2004 a; Gan and <b>Pilliar</b> 2004; Zhang et al. 2006; Stoica et al. 2008). Depending upon the temperature, different calcium orthophosphate compounds are obtained. The resulting coatings, layers or films can be extremely dense and adhere strongly to the underlying substrate (de Groot et al. 1998). Occasionally, {{in order to improve}} the bond strength between the coating and the substrate, an intervening layer of another compound might be applied prior the sol-gel deposition of a calcium orthophosphate (Kim et al. 2004 b).|$|E
40|$|The Windsor Yearbook of Access to Justice {{is proud}} to publish issue 32 (1). This issue {{features}} a special section highlighting the scholarship of graduate students. While {{it is always a}} pleasure to read promising work by newer scholars in the fields of law and social justice, we are certain that this collection of articles represents some of the finest and thought-provoking scholarship stemming from current graduate students in law. The articles stem from a graduate student essay contest that WYAJ held in 2013 and for which we received many submissions. The collection of selected papers offers a view of legal and interdisciplinary research examining issues that are topically diverse but which are all of deep, long-term importance to the world of access to justice. A reader of the special section on Graduate Student Scholarship will find explorations of access to justice from the perspectives of equality rights, discretion, adjudication and methods of legal service delivery, to name a few. A prize was offered to two papers judged to be of exceptional quality. I am very pleased to announce that the winners of those two prizes are Andrew <b>Pilliar,</b> for his article “Exploring a Law Firm Business Model to Improve Access to Justice” and Blair A. Major, for his contribution, “Religion and Law in R v NS: Finding Space to Re-think the Balancing Analysis”. The Editorial Board thanks all those who submitted papers to the contest and to this final special issue of the Windsor Yearbook of Access to Justice. Another notable feature of this issue is the introduction of a section called Research Notes. The Yearbook will periodically publish peer-reviewed research notes that present the findings of empirical (quantitative, qualitative or mixed method) research studies. This section aims to contribute to the growing and important body of empirical scholarship within the realm of access to justice socio-legal research. We hope that you enjoy this issue.
