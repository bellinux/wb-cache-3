50|$|Established in 1961 as Kongo Bearing Company, NTN Kongo Corporation {{manufactures}} {{and develops}} not only radial ball <b>bearings,</b> <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> <b>bearings,</b> bearing units and clutch release bearings, but also develops and produces bearing production equipment used by NTN Corporation.|$|R
50|$|Initially, the Simplicity Bearing {{was only}} offered in closed, {{imperial}} sizes. PBC quickly developed an open {{version of the}} bearing {{to be used with}} supported shafts. Open and closed <b>Pillow</b> <b>Blocks,</b> Flanged <b>bearings,</b> die set bearings and bushings followed. The company then developed ISO Metric and finally JIS Metric bearings.|$|R
50|$|In the {{traditional}} {{style of a}} babbitt metal bearing, a cast iron <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> is assembled as a loose fit around the shaft, with the shaft in approximately its final position. The inner face of the cast iron <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> is often drilled to form a key to locate the bearing metal as it is cast into place. The shaft is coated with soot as a release agent, {{the ends of the}} bearing are packed with clay, and molten metal poured into the cavity around the shaft, initially half filling the <b>pillow</b> <b>block.</b> The <b>bearing</b> is stripped, and the metal trimmed back to the top surface of the <b>pillow</b> <b>block.</b> Hardened babbitt metal is soft enough to be cut with a knife or sharp chisel.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{incredible}} growth that Toyo underwent, the organization decentralized by creating subsidiaries to oversee new products. In 1961, Toyo {{set up a}} joint venture with INA Wälzlager Schaeffler called NTN Wälzlager Europa in order to manufacture needle bearings. Toyo utilized design data from INA Wälzlager Schaeffler to make these products. They also established Kongo Bearing Company to manage the creation of <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> <b>bearings.</b> One year later, Toyo founded Senyo Kosakuki Kenkyujo, a maker of ball bearing equipment. In 1963, Toyo entered into business with Hardy Spicer to produce Birfield-type constant-velocity universal joints. They also pursued business overseas by establishing NTN Bearing Corporation of America. The following year, working with GKN Transmission, the company fabricated constant-velocity joints in their home country and formed NTN Bearing-GKN while also opening a facility in Europe called NTN France. The year after that, Toyo started manufacturing oil-impregnated sintered bearings and pipe fittings. Four years later in 1968, the company set up yet another facility in North America called NTN Bearing Corporation of Canada.|$|R
50|$|A <b>pillow</b> <b>block,</b> {{also known}} as a plummer <b>block</b> or housed <b>bearing</b> unit, is a {{pedestal}} used to provide support for a rotating shaft with the help of compatible bearings & various accessories. Housing material for a <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> is typically made of cast iron or cast steel.|$|R
50|$|A steel shim is {{inserted}} {{to protect the}} face of the lower bearing and to space the cap of the <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> away from the shaft. After resealing the ends with clay, more metal is then poured to fill the cap of the <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> {{through the hole in the}} top of the <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> cap which will eventually be a lubrication hole.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> usually {{refers to}} a housing with an {{included}} anti-friction <b>bearing.</b> A <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> {{refers to a}}ny mounted bearing wherein the mounted shaft is in a parallel plane to the mounting surface, and perpendicular to the center line of the mounting holes, as contrasted with various types of flange blocks or flange units. A <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> may contain a bearing with one of several types of rolling elements, including ball, cylindrical roller, spherical roller, tapered roller, or metallic or synthetic bushing. The type of rolling element defines the type of <b>pillow</b> <b>block.</b> These differ from [...] "plumber blocks" [...] which are bearing housings supplied without any bearings and are usually meant for higher load ratings and a separately installed bearing.|$|R

50|$|Stems tighten {{around and}} hold the {{handlebar}} either by pinch bolts, which require 'feeding' the handlebar through the stem after removing controls, accessories and bar covering; or via detachable faceplates, also called <b>pillow</b> <b>blocks,</b> especially on BMX bicycles, which allow a handlebar with controls, accessories or bar covering to be removed intact. Stems with faceplates or <b>pillow</b> <b>blocks</b> are known as pop-top stems.|$|R

40|$|AbstractConstruction {{of low-income}} housing {{projects}} is a replicated process and {{is associated with}} uncertainties that arise from the unavailability of resources. Government agencies and/or contractors have to select a construction system that meets low-income housing projects constraints including project conditions, technical, financial and time constraints. This research presents a framework, using computer simulation, which aids government authorities and contractors in the planning of low-income housing projects. The proposed framework estimates the time and cost required {{for the construction of}} low-income housing using pre-cast hollow core with hollow <b>blocks</b> <b>bearing</b> walls. Five main components constitute the proposed framework: a network builder module, a construction alternative selection module, a simulation module, an optimization module and a reporting module. An optimization module utilizing a genetic algorithm enables the defining of different options and ranges of parameters associated with low-income housing projects that influence the duration and total cost of the pre-cast hollow core with hollow <b>blocks</b> <b>bearing</b> walls method. A computer prototype, named LIHouse_Sim, was developed in MS Visual Basic 6. 0 as proof of concept for the proposed framework. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the use of the developed framework and to illustrate its essential features...|$|R
