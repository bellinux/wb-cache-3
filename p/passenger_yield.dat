40|$|Commercial Aircraft are {{commonly}} acquired by an airline in {{a contract that}} specifies a fixed quantity of firm orders as well as options that allow the airline to obtain additional aircraft at a future time for an agreed price. This option purchasing process allows the customer to avoid taking delivery of aircraft if economic circumstances are not favorable. However, this model can have drawbacks in circumstances when the product in question is in very high demand. Exercising a rolling-style aircraft purchase option in such circumstances {{may result in a}} delivery lag of several years, during which profitable opportunities may be lost. Shortening the time between exercising an option and taking delivery of the aircraft would allow for better timing of the delivery and reduce the effect of a significant negative event such as an economic recession or a terrorist attack occurring between the exercise date and the delivery date. (cont.) In this thesis, an alternative purchasing system using fixed-term aircraft purchase options is presented. In this system, customers are able to make the decision to exercise an option at a later point in time, with more information, yet receive the aircraft {{at the same time as}} the current system. Additionally, in situations where the decision to accept an aircraft has been made, it will allow the customer to acquire the aircraft sooner. The proposed alternative system is presented and the potential benefits and difficulties are discussed including potential incentives for manufacturers to offer such a system. A simulation is presented to compare the relative value of a fixed-term option to a rolling option under hypothetical circumstances. The simulation shows that under the circumstances modeled, the fixed-term option system is superior to the existing rolling option system in yield environments where profitability is close to zero. This advantage decreases as profitability increases and at very high profitability levels, such as in a very strong <b>passenger</b> <b>yield</b> environment, the existing option structure is superior. The results are consistent over a wide range of average consumer fares and discount rates. by Owen Miller. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Abstract: The goal of {{this study}} was to measure {{ultrafine}} particle concentrations with diameters less than 1 Âµm emitted by diesel buses and to assess resulting human exposure levels. The study was conducted at the Woolloongabba Busway station in Brisbane, Australia in the winter months of 2002 during which temperature inversions frequently occurred. Most buses that utilize the station are fuelled by diesel, the exhaust of which contains a significant quantity of particle matter. Passengers waiting at the station are exposed to these particles emitted from the buses. During the course of this study, passenger census was conducted, based on video surveillance, yielding person-by-person waiting time data. Furthermore, a bus census revealed accurate information about the total number of diesel versus Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) powered buses. Background (outside of the bus station) and platform measurements of ultrafine particulate number size distributions were made to determine ambient aerosol concentrations. Particle number exposure concentration ranges from 10 and 40 to 60 % of bus related exhaust fumes. This changes dramatically when considering the particle mass exposure concentration, where most passengers are exposed to about 50 to 80 % of exhaust fumes. The obtained data can be very significant for comparison with similar work of this type because it is shown in previous studies that exhaust emissions causes cancer in laboratory animals.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} use of demand driven {{dispatch}} in the hub and spoke environment prevalent in the route networks of major airlines in the United States. Demand driven dispatch is an operational mode where aircraft assignments can be changed in response to variation in demand. A computer program simulated the functions of a revenue management system and an optimal aircraft assignment routine {{over the course of}} the passenger booking process. An isolated hub with service exclusively between the hub and 15 spoke cities was assumed. Two series of quantitative studies were done, one looking at the possible profit improvements at various demand levels with demand driven dispatch and the other examining the sensitivity of demand driven dispatch results to when the first and last optimal reassignment of hub aircraft was made in the booking process. In the first series, comparisons were made between results obtained from static aircraft assignments and fully dynamic demand driven dispatch assignments. Several scenarios were simulated. These involved various combinations of demand distribution, demand balance, and booking process assumptions. Booking process sensitivity studies were performed on a small subset of the scenario combinations. A discussion of practical issues which could affect implementation is also included. Results show that demand driven dispatch performance is fairly uniform regardless of the scenario with the best projected yearly profit increases for a major hub and spoke operator of $ 35 -$ 40 million over the current fixed assignment practice. This occurred at load factors similar to airline historical levels of 65 %. The profit increases at normal demand levels were achieved mostly through better aircraft utilization patterns (lower costs) and not revenue enhancement. At higher average load factors demand driven dispatch improvement was less significant but was always positive. Studies on when demand driven dispatch was applied during the booking process showed that major benefits could be gained by evaluating assignments even once as long as this assignment period preceded any significant level of high <b>yield</b> <b>passenger</b> booking requests.

40|$|With {{the growth}} of Low Cost Carriers (LCC) and their use of {{simplified}} fare structures, the airline industry has seen an increased removal of many fare restrictions, especially in markets with intense LCC presence. This resulted in "semi-restricted" fare structure where there are homogenous fare classes that are undifferentiated except by price and also distinct fare classes which are still differentiated by booking restrictions and advance purchase requirements. In this new fare environment, the use of traditional Revenue Management (RM) systems, which were developed {{based on the assumption}} of independence of demand of fare classes, tend to lead to a spiral down effect. Airlines now have to deal with customers who systematically buy the lowest fare available in the absence of distinctions between the fare classes. This result in fewer bookings observed in the higher fare classes, leading to lower forecast and less protection of seats for the higher <b>yield</b> <b>passengers.</b> This thesis describes Fare Adjustment, a technique developed for network RM systems, which acts at the booking limit optimizer level as it takes into account the sell-up potential of passengers (the probability that a passenger is willing to buy a higher-fare ticket if his request is denied). (cont.) The goal of this thesis is to provide a more comprehensive investigation into the effectiveness of fare adjustment as a tool to improve airline revenues in this new environment by 1) extending the investigation of the effectiveness of fare adjustment with standard forecasting to leg-based RM systems (namely EMSRb and HBP) and also a mixed fare structure where different fare structures are used for different markets, and 2) looking at the alternative use of fare adjustment in the reservation system. Experiments with the Passenger Origin-Destination Simulator demonstrate that RM Fare Adjustment with standard forecasting can improve an airline's network revenue by 0. 8 % to 1. 3 % over standard revenue management methods. In particular, RM Fare Adjustment reduces the aggressiveness of path forecasting through the lowering of bid prices as it takes into account the risk of buying-down. Simulations of Fare Adjustment in the Reservation System also showed positive results with revenue improvement of about 0. 4 % to 0. 7 %. by Yin Shiang Valenrina Soo. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Growing {{passenger}} {{dimensions and}} the demand for more comfort in the economy class cabin is a trend that is becoming more important during aircraft conceptual design. Based on recent investigations, it is known that current aircraft seat dimensions are not suitable and safe for {{a large part of the}} world population. Therefore, a change in aircraft conceptual design thinking, by taking human anthropometry into account, is required. This thesis investigates the opportunity to change the aircraft during conceptual design as well as the opportunity to change current aircraft in order to provide a higher level of passenger comfort and safety. To measure the latter, a comfort model is created, based on scientific research and human dimensions, allowing for the measurement of comfort related to seating configurations, seat characteristics, and cabin dimensions. By establishing the ideal seat dimensions, it is shown that conceptual aircraft designs for the worldwide 95 percentile passenger require wider, but shorter, fuselages. Using the Initiator as a conceptual design tool, four short-haul and four long-haul aircraft are modeled for a range of seat dimensions. Based on an inside-out aircraft design approach, it is shown that similar aircraft performance characteristics are obtained when designing for the worldwide 95 passenger percentile. Moreover, a similar level of direct operating costs, and hence profitability, is attained. However, designing for the worldwide 99 <b>passenger</b> percentile <b>yields</b> considerably higher fuel burn rates and operating costs. An average increase of 3. 9 % among all modeled aircraft is seen for the harmonic fuel burn, leading to an increase of 4. 2 % in direct operating costs. Considering existing aircraft, use is made of an outside-in aircraft design approach to assess a set of performance characteristics. Based on an average utilization of 37 % of the cargo space in commercial transport aircraft, a potential is shown for a different utilization of the aircraft lower deck, allowing the airline to provide more passenger comfort while retaining a similar level of profitability. Using the Airbus A 340 - 300 as reference aircraft, it is shown that the placement of passengers in the lower hold is feasible from a regulatory, ergonomical, economical, and structural point of view. Based on a reference three-class layout with 267 passengers, it is shown that a lower deck seating compartment provides an increase of 14. 6 % in the number of passengers when similar seat properties are used as on the main passenger deck. The installment of additional furnishing and required structural reinforcements results in a decrease of 12 % in maximum structural payload weight. Nevertheless, it is shown that the placement of passengers in the lower deck yields higher profitability rates for the airline when compared to the carriage of additional freight. Secondly, the placement of lavatories and galleys in the aircraft lower deck is investigated, allowing for a maximum increase of 13 % in passenger seats. To allow for the installment of galley lift systems, staircases, and required safety measures, a decrease of 6. 27 % in maximum structural payload is attained. By subsequently increasing seat characteristics on the main deck, an increase of 12 % in passenger comfort is achieved for the worldwide 95 passenger percentile. The airline profitability level associated to this comfort layout in turn relates to an average carriage of 5300 kg of freight during the aircraft service life, being equal to the current average. For both the lower deck seating and service utilization, it is concluded that the flying experience of the passenger is increased, while a similar level of airline and manufacturer profitability is obtained. Aircraft lower deck utilization can therefore be seen as a feasible replacement for conventional aircraft configurations. Flight Performance and PropulsionAerospace Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Airlines have {{increasingly}} depended on ancillary revenue {{in response to}} rising fuel costs, de- creased yields, and an increasingly competitive environment. Estimates indicate that U. S. airlines collected over $ 8 billion in ancillary revenue in 2012. Ancillary revenue poses challenges for airlines, including revenue management (RM) and distribution since total revenue maximization requires consideration of ancillary revenue and ticket revenue. In this thesis, we: (1) describe trends contributing to the movement towards ancillary revenue; (2) present three methods for incorporating ancillary revenue into revenue management and distribution; (3) evaluate the revenue performance of these methods using the Passenger Origin Destination Simulator (PODS), a competitive airline simulator. One method of including ancillary revenue into RM is RM Input Adjustment with Class Level Estimates, which involves modifying input fares to the optimizer. Because fare values to the optimizer are aggregated by market and class, the airline uses class level estimates of ancillary revenue potential to augment fares. Another method involves modifying the fare value {{at the time of}} availability control, or Availability Fare Adjustment. In network optimization, the availability fare refers to the fare used to compare an itinerary-class to the control mechanism, like displacement adjusted virtual nesting (DAVN) or additive bid price (ProBP). Availability Fare Adjustment with Class Level Estimates also involves using class level estimates of ancillary revenue. Alternatively, we test scenarios where the airline estimates ancillary revenue for individual passengers in Customized Availability Fare Adjustment with Passenger Specific Estimates. Although this type of estimation is not feasible yet, results from Customized Availability Adjustment give a theoretical bound to revenue gain. We nd that incorporating ancillary revenue opens availability for lower <b>yield</b> <b>passengers.</b> Revenue increases occur from extra bookings in these classes because more bookings are taken. Revenue losses occur from higher class passengers buying down to cheaper seats. Without willingness to pay (WTP) forecasting, net revenue losses of up to { 2. 6 % are observed. In advanced RM systems with WTP forecasting, revenue gains of + 0. 6 % are observed for Class Level RM Input Adjustment, + 0. 9 % for Class Level Availability Fare Adjustment, and + 2. 6 % for Passenger Specific Customized Availability Adjustment. by Eric Hao.
