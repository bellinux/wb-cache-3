To {{overcome this problem}} in the above batch operation of 15 % initial solid load, we performed fed-batch enzymatic hydrolysis to enhance the total fermentable sugar concentration. The glucose, xylose, and cellobiose concentrations were 13.15, 6.67, and 2.92  g/L at 10 % initial substrate consistency after 12  h enzymatic hydrolysis (Fig.  4 c, d). Then, fed-batch supplementation of cow manure (final 15 % biomass, m/v) and SN- 1 enzyme was implemented to enhance total sugar production, and 22.29  g/L ethanol was subsequently obtained by co-fermentation of glucose and xylose from the cow manure hydrolysates (Fig.  4 c). The residual glucose and xylose concentrations were 0.53 and 1.16  g/L in the supernatant from the pretreated cow manure, respectively. Similarly, when anaerobically digested cow manure was hydrolyzed, the glucose, xylose, and cellobiose concentrations were 10.02, 5.13, and 1.83  g/L, respectively, and then 15.80  g/L ethanol was obtained (Fig.  4 d).

The genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction of S. cerevisiae enabled in silico gene deletion predictions using an evolutionary programming method to couple biomass and succinate production. Glycine and serine, both essential amino acids required for biomass formation, are formed from both glycolytic and TCA cycle intermediates. Succinate formation results from the isocitrate lyase catalyzed conversion of isocitrate, and from the a-keto-glutarate dehydrogenase catalyzed conversion of a-keto-glutarate. Succinate is subsequently depleted by the succinate dehydrogenase complex.

40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae is {{the most}} well {{characterized}} eukaryote, the preferred microbial cell factory for the largest industrial biotechnology <b>product</b> (<b>bioethanol),</b> and a robust commercially compatible scaffold to be exploited for diverse chemical production. Succinic acid is a highly sought after added-value chemical which is not overproduced in native S. cerevisiae strains. The genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction of S. cerevisiae enabled in silico gene deletion predictions. First, a multi-gene, non-intuitive, genetic engineering strategy guided by an evolutionary programming method to couple biomass formation through glycine/serine amino acid requirements to succinate production was proposed. Pursuing these targets, a multi-gene deletion strain was constructed, and directed evolution with selection was used to identify a succinate producing mutant. Physiological characterization coupled with integrated data analysis of transcriptome data in the metabolically engineered strain were used to identify 2 nd-round metabolic engineering targets – overexpression of ICL 1. The resulting strain represents a 30 -fold improvement in succinate titer, and a 43 -fold improvement in succinate yield on biomass, with only a 2. 8 -fold decrease in the specific growth rate compared to the reference strain. Further genome-scale metabolic modeling supplemented with pathway visualization, flux balance analysis, and model modifications to better simulate batch glucose conditions was performed. Identification of the top single and double gene deletion strategies, under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, resulted in three predictions with a 10 -fold improvement in succinate yield on glucose compared to the reference: MDH 1, OAC 1, and DIC 1. While &#x 22 BF;mdh 1 and &#x 22 BF;oac 1 strains failed to produce more succinate relative to the reference, &#x 22 BF;dic 1 produced 0. 02 C-mol C-mol-glucose- 1, {{in close agreement with}} model predictions (0. 03 C-mol C-mol-glucose- 1). Pathway visualization, coupled with transcriptional profiling, suggested that succinate formation was coupled to mitochondrial redox balancing, and more specifically, reductive TCA cycle activity. The aforementioned metabolic engineering strategies were designed based on glucose supplementation and metabolism. Future S. cerevisiae microbial cell factories capable of fast and efficient xylose consumption for biorefinery compatibility, and succinic acid overproduction would be highly desirable. Metabolic engineering of S. cerevisiae for consumption of xylose aerobically without redirection of some carbon flux to overflow metabolites (ethanol, glycerol, acetate, xylitol) was accomplished by expression of PsXYL 1, PsXYL 2, and PsXYL 3 from the native xylose-metabolizing Pichia stipitis, and subsequent, directed evolution. The resulting S. cerevisiae strain showed xylose consumption at a specific rate of 0. 31 g g-cell- 1 h- 1, a specific growth rate of 0. 18 h- 1, and a biomass yield of 0. 62 C-mol C-mol-xylose- 1. Plasmid isolation and re-transformation confirmed the conferred phenotype resulted from a chromosomal modification. Transcriptional profiling confirmed a strongly up-regulated glyoxylate pathway enabling sustained respiratory metabolism. A proof-of-concept study was performed to determine if whole high-throughput genome sequencing {{could be used as a}} tool in metabolic engineering for direct identification of genotype to phenotype correlations. Therefore, whole genome sequencing of S. cerevisiae S 288 C and CEN. PK 113 - 7 D resulted in identification of 13, 787 filtered SNPs in CEN. PK 113 - 7 D, with a total of 939 SNPs detected across 158 unique metabolic genes, 85 of which contained a total of 219 nonsilent SNPs. S. cerevisiae CEN.

Due to abundant lignocellulose biomass resources in Indonesia, such as empty fruit bunch (EFB) of oil palm, sugarcane bagasse and other forrest residue, the research in the development of process for 2 nd generation bioethanol production is being increase. This case can be a right solution to solve the problem because lignocellulose is unused material. Processing of lignocellulosic biomass into bioethanol consists of four major unit operations: pre-treatment, hydrolysis, fermentation and product separation/distillation.

Determination of the impurity is important to prove the quality of produced bioethanol. Some of the impurities is not allowed in the product, such as methanol and others organic, that should be limited to control the performance from bioethanol as substituted fuel. Organic impurities of the <b>bioethanol</b> <b>product</b> was analyzed by using GC-FID while the water content was analyzed by using Karl Fischer Coulometric Moisture Titrator.

The final integrated bioethanol network design allowed the reduction of <b>bioethanol</b> <b>product</b> utilisation by 94 %, avoiding significant revenue losses. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

The biomass {{that has been used}} in this research is sawdust. In order to recover cellulose from sawdust, it is necessary to treat the sawdust using dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment as to remove the lignin and hemicelluloses that bonding the cellulose structure. Compared with the untreated sawdust, 3. 4 g/l glucose was dissolved from the cellulose, whereas hemicelluloses which are xylose and arabinose in pre-treated sawdust decreased to 2. 5 g/l and 6. 8 g/l, respectively. The results of infrared spectra (IR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis also showed that the structure and the surface of the sawdust were changed through pretreatment and crystalline cellulose in sawdust pretreated was disrupted. The maximum cellulose recovery of sawdust was achieved at a sulfuric acid concentration of 4 % and pretreatment time of 120 minutes...|$|R
40|$|Progressive global {{dilemmas}} such as {{greenhouse gas}} emissions and depleting crude oil supply have sparked an exponential interest {{in the use of}} bioethanol in the motor-fuel industry. To date, bioethanol production from cereal grains and lignocellulose feedstock has been extensively researched but the use of agro-industrial waste <b>products</b> for <b>bioethanol</b> production also has potential. One such product is cashew apples. Cashew apples are regarded as waste after cashew nut harvesting and are an attractive feedstock for bioethanol {{due to the lack of}} commercial usage. The present work, therefore aimed to investigate the characteristics of cashew apple juice extracted from cashew apples grown in South Africa and to evaluate the concentration of bioethanol obtainable from cashew apple juice by fermentation using Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains NRRL Y 2084 and Vin 13. Furthermore, this research aimed to show the compatibility of ethanol/petrol blends and determine the change in fuel level of a generator fuelled with ethanol/petrol blends. During the February harvest season, a mixed variety of cashew apples collected from the KwaNgwanase region revealed the following characteristics: specific gravity of 1. 050 and pH of 4. 52 by direct measurement; total sugars: 100 g/L by HPLC; total minerals: 15. 89 ppm by iii AAS; condensed tannins: 55. 34 mg/L by the Vanillin-HCl assay; proteins: 1. 78 g/L by the Coomassie Blue assay; Vitamin C: 112 mg/ 100 mL by the Iodine Titration. Post characterization, the cashew apple juice was fermented in a BIOSTAT® Bplus fermentor. The fermentation conditions were as follows: pH= 4. 50, agitation= 150 rpm, temperature= 30 ºC (Y 2084) and 20 ºC (Vin 13), oxygen saturation= 0...|$|R

Bioethanol production from Iles-iles (Amorphophaluscampanulatus) tuber as alternative fuel has been conducted by hydrolysis followed by fermentation. The purification of <b>bioethanol</b> <b>product</b> was performed by distillation (using traditional and automatic distillation) and either adsorption or pervaporation. In hydrolysis process, 140 g/L of reducing sugar was produced, which then was fermented by using yeast Sacharomycescerevisiae (2. 5 - 20 g/L) resulting 50 - 80 g/L ethanol with the concentration was 7 - 9 % (v/v). In order to obtain 90 L ethanol with 90 % purity, traditional distillation equipment required 21 hours operation, whereas automatic distillation required 12. 5 hours. Then, adsorption process produced bioethanol 99 % with ethanol raw materials at concentrations of 90 % and 95 % which resulted the breakthrough time of 60 and 120 minutes, respectively. Purification process with membrane pervaporation for 2 hours using ethanol raw material 95 % (v/v) produced ethanol 99 % (v/v) with ethanol flux was 20 kg/m 2. hour...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} part of the article were {{presented}} the technical possibilities of obtaining solid biomass, biogas, landfill gas, a biogas from wastewater treatment plants, bioethanol and biodiesel. Then processes was described, allowing use of energy from biomass. As first was discussed the incineration which includes drying and degassing of the wood materials, wood gas burning at 1200 °C, post-combustion gas and heat transfer in the heat exchanger. Then had been described gasification, or thermochemical conversion process, occurring at high temperature. It is two-stage process. In the first chamber at deficiency of air and at relatively low temperatures (450 – 800 °C), the fuel is being degasified, resulting in creating combustible gas and a mineral residue (charcoal). In the second stage, secondary combustion chamber and at a temperature of about 1000 – 1200 °C and in the presence of excess of oxygen resultant gas is burned. A further process is pyrolysis. It consists of the steps of drying fuel to a moisture level below 10 %, milling the biomass into very small particles, the pyrolysis reaction, separation of solid products, cooling and collecting bio-oil. Then discusses co-generation, which is combined production of heat and electricity. In this situation where the biomass contains too much water it can be used for energy purposes through biochemical processes. The alcoholic fermentation results in decomposition of carbohydrates taking place under anaerobic conditions, and the <b>product</b> is <b>bioethanol.</b> Another biochemical process used for the production of liquid biofuels is esterification of vegetable oils. Methane fermentation in turn causes a decomposition of macromolecular organic substances with limited oxygen available. As a result, we obtain alcohols, lower organic acids, methane, carbon dioxide and water.

40|$|Cellulose {{crystallinity}} {{assessment is}} important for optimizing the yield of cellulose <b>products,</b> such as <b>bioethanol.</b> X-ray diffraction is often {{used for this purpose}} for its perceived robustness and availability. In this work, the five most common analysis methods (the Segal peak height method and those based on peak fitting and/or amorphous standards) are critically reviewed and compared to two-dimensional Rietveld refinement. A larger () and more varied collection of samples than previous studies have presented is used. In particular, samples () with low crystallinity and small crystallite sizes are included. A good linear correlation () between the five most common methods suggests that they agree on large-scale crystallinity differences between samples. For small crystallinity differences, however, correlation was not seen for samples that were from distinct sample sets. The least-squares fitting using an amorphous standard shows the smallest crystallite size dependence and this method combined with perpendicular transmission geometry also yielded values closest to independently obtained cellulose crystallinity values. On the other hand, these values are too low according to the Rietveld refinement. All analysis methods have weaknesses that should be considered when assessing differences in sample crystallinity...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{industry}} {{is facing the}} necessity of improving process efficiency, {{especially in terms of}} energy and raw materials consumption. In most of the cases, the production of pulp and paper generates an energy surplus that is often not conveniently used. The actual trend is to convert traditional pulp and paper processes in biorefineries where all components of lignocellulosic materials can be converted in added value <b>products</b> such as <b>bioethanol,</b> lignin, cellulose whiskers and other chemicals than can replace the common petroleum based products. In the present work, the energetic and economical efficiencies of two biorefinery processes were studied using the simulation software Aspen Plus. Soda and organosolv processes were used for raw material delignification. The simulation design and treatment sequences (reaction, solid fraction washing, products recovery and liquid fraction processing) are similar for both processes. Mass and energy balances were established and the processes were compared in terms of yield, solvents/reactants recovery and energy consumption based on the same amount of processed raw material. In this way, the development of rigorous simulations allowed to determine the economical feasibility of both biorefinery models, and to establish the optimal operation conditions for both processes...|$|R
40|$|The first pilot-scale {{factories}} for {{the production}} of bioethanol from lignocellulose have been installed, indicating that we are on the brink of overcoming most hurdles for an economically feasible process. When bioethanol is competitive as biofuel with fuels originating from petrochemical resources, it will also become interesting to use lignocellulose as a feedstock for the fermentative synthesis of bulk chemicals. Lignocellulose hydrolysates, however, are highly complex and viscous media, posing challenges to oxygen transfer, product formation at low sugar concentration, <b>product</b> recovery, etc. <b>Bioethanol</b> is an exceptional product in this respect because it can be produced anaerobically, at low sugar concentrations, and can be easily removed from the broth by distillation. For products that do not have these benefits, another approach may be interesting, in which lignocellulose is first converted to bioethanol, which in turn serves as a substrate for a second conversion into the desired product, similar to the traditional production of acetic acid in vinegar. In this perspective, we compare these one-stage and two-stage conversions with respect to overall yield and productivity of the fermentation process and the differences that occur in product removal. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Lt...|$|R

Pre-hydrolysis process was done on the above mentioned waste by hot water, hot water followed by 0. 5 percent sulfuric acid and also alone sulfuric acid with different concentrations (0. 5, 1, 1. 5 and 2 percent) The samples were pre-hydrolyzed in hot water at 150 °C and 30, 60 and 90 minutes {{as well as in}} the mixture of hot water and 0. 5 % sulfuric acid at 150 °C and 60 minutes and also in pure sulfuric acid, at 130 °C and at 60 minutes. The results showed that the pre-hydrolyzed treatment with hot water in 60 minutes had been favorable performance in the respect of weight loss, lignin content and holocellulose percent. Also, in the case of pre-treatment including sulfuric acid, 2 % dose can be good selected option in term of maximum holocellulose percent and minimum lignin content so that it can be suggested to produce higher value-added <b>products</b> such as <b>bioethanol</b> from licorice root bid...|$|R
