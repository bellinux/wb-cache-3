40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{a number}} of studies have {{compared}} the influence of different electrical pulse parameters on maximum electrically induced torque (MEIT) and discomfort, the role of <b>phase</b> <b>duration</b> has been poorly investigated. OBJECTIVE: To examine the variation in muscle torque and discomfort produced when electrically stimulating quadriceps femoris using pulsed current with three different phase durations in order to establish whether there are any advantages or disadvantages in varying the <b>phase</b> <b>duration</b> over the range examined. METHOD: This is a two repeated-measures, within-subject study conducted in a research laboratory. The study was divided into 2 parts with 19 healthy young adults in each part. In part 1, MEIT was determined for each <b>phase</b> <b>duration</b> (400, 700, and 1000 &# 181;s), using a biphasic pulsed current at a frequency of 50 Hz. In part 2, stimulus amplitude was increased until the contractions reached 40 % of maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and the associated discomfort produced by each <b>phase</b> <b>duration</b> was measured. RESULTS: In part 1 of the study, we found that the average MEITs generated with each <b>phase</b> <b>duration</b> (400, 700, and 1000 &# 181;s) were 55. 0, 56. 3, and 58. 0 % of MVIC respectively, but the differences were not statistically significant (p=. 45). In part 2, we found a statistically significant increase in discomfort over the same range of phase durations. The results indicate that, for a given level of torque production, discomfort increases with increasing <b>phase</b> <b>duration</b> (p=. 008). CONCLUSIONS: Greater muscle torque cannot be produced by increasing the stimulus <b>phase</b> <b>duration</b> over the range examined.

The effects of <b>phase</b> <b>duration</b> on thresholds were studied using single pulses, and 500 ms pulse trains at 100 pps. Psychophysical detection thresholds decreased {{as a function}} of <b>phase</b> <b>duration</b> with a change in slope at approximately 0. 5 ms/phase. Mean single-pulse and pulse-train slopes were - 3. 60 and - 4. 25 dB/doubling of <b>phase</b> <b>duration</b> for pulse durations of less than about 0. 5 ms/phase. For pulse durations greater than 0. 5 ms/phase, mean slopes were - 5. 71 and - 7. 54 dB/doubling for single pulses and pulse trains, respectively. Thresholds for pulse trains decreased {{as a function of}} stimulus duration for durations up to at least 300 ms, with the rate of decrease being dependent on the <b>phase</b> <b>duration</b> of the pulse. Effects of stimulus duration were greater for longer <b>phase</b> <b>duration</b> signals. We hypothesize that the longer <b>phase</b> <b>duration</b> pulses activate multiple spikes in a single fiber and/or more effective patterns of spikes across fibers, which may explain why slopes of psychophysical threshold functions are steeper than those of functions for single auditory nerve fibers for longer duration pulses. Thresholds were compared to respective speech perception scores (CID sentences) since thresholds for long <b>phase</b> <b>duration</b> signals have been shown previously to be correlated with nerve survival patterns, and nerve survival patterns may affect speech perception.

40|$|Abstract The tri-phasic reflex in {{hermit crab}} (Pagurus pollicarus) abdomen is {{triggered}} by local mechanore-ceptors and {{is essential for}} postural control. The reflex consists of three stereotypical phases: a brief, high-fre-quency burst, a transient cessation of firing, and a late-discharge that is much lower in frequency than the initial burst. To better understand the reflex generation of force, variability of motoneuron discharge in each of five parameters of reflex activation was assessed. An intra-cellular current injection routine was used to correlate each of these parameters with force production. Phase 3 motoneuron firing frequency showed the greatest cor-relation with force production. Phase 3 spike rate in-creased {{as a function of}} <b>phase</b> 2 <b>duration,</b> but the relationship between <b>phase</b> 2 <b>duration</b> and force pro-duced by the reflex was weak. Junction potential amplitude decreased as <b>phase</b> 2 <b>duration</b> increased, and we hypothesize that this trend counteracts the increased phase 3 frequency, explaining the weak relationship of <b>phase</b> 2 <b>duration</b> and force production. Surprisingly, when phase 3 frequency was held constant and phase 2 was increased in duration, the concurrent decrease in junction potential amplitude did not reduce force pro-duction...|$|R

40|$|We derive {{the optimal}} {{resource}} allocation of a practical half-duplex scheme for the Gaussian multiple access channel with transmitter cooperation (MAC-TC). Based on rate splitting and superposition coding, two users transmit {{information to a}} destination over 3 phases, such that the users partially exchange their information during the first 2 phases and cooperatively transmit to the destination during the last one. This scheme is near capacity-achieving when the inter-user links are stronger than each user-destination link; it also includes partial decode-forward relaying as a special case. We propose efficient algorithms to find the optimal resource allocation for maximizing either the individual or the sum rate and identify the corresponding optimal scheme for each channel configuration. For fixed <b>phase</b> <b>durations,</b> the power allocation problem is convex and can be solved analytically based on the KKT conditions.

Relative to the un-resisted condition, sprint time increased (7. 5 to 19. 8 %) in both resisted conditions, resulting mainly from decreased step length (− 5. 2 to − 16. 5 %) with small decreases in step frequency (− 2. 7 to − 6. 1 %).

40|$|The {{pharyngeal}} {{phase of}} swallow has been {{thought to be}} a stereotypical motor behavior. This is a prospective, preclinical, hypothesis driven, one group by three-task design. We sought to compare the effects of pharyngeal swabbing, water only, and water plus punctate mechanical stimulation on the spatiotemporal features of the pharyngeal phase of swallow in the cat. Swallow was elicited under these three conditions in six anaesthetized cats. Electromyographic activity was recorded from seven muscles used to evaluate swallow: mylohyoid, geniohyoid, thyrohyoid, thyroarytenoid, thyropharyngeus, cricopharyngeus, and parasternal. Pharyngeal swabbing in comparison to the other stimulus conditions, results in decreases in post-swallow cricopharyngeus activity (upper esophageal sphincter); a significant increase in parasternal (schluckatmung; swallow breath) activity; and increases in thyrohyoid (laryngeal elevator), thyroarytenoid (laryngeal adductor) and parasternal muscles burst duration. Pearson correlations were found of moderate strength between 19 % of burst duration comparisons and weak to moderate relationships between 29 % of burst amplitude comparisons. However, there were no positive significant relationships between <b>phase</b> <b>durations</b> and electromyogram amplitudes between any of the muscles studied during swallow.
