40|$|Food {{manufacturers}} use {{a variety}} of technologies to produce minimally <b>processed</b> <b>fruits.</b> Shelf-life extension can be achieved by the use of several techniques, such as refrigeration associated to modified atmosphere packaging, aseptic packaging, chemical treatment, etc (Ronk et al, 1989). Minimal processing includes operations (washing, peeling, coring and cutting) that must be performed to provide a totally edible products that needs no further preparation (Howard and Griffin, 1993). Physiological and biochemical changes in such products may occur at a faster rate due to tissue damage. Wounding stimulates respiration rate, induces the ethylene synthesis, the oxidation of phenolics, the enzymatic activity, and the microbiological development, leading to an accelerated quality loss, especially colour and firmness attributes (Kim et al, 1993). Control of wounding and/or its consequences is the major challenge to the postharvest life of minimally <b>processed</b> <b>fruits.</b> Mass marketing of these products will require a new perspective of shelf-life and quality assurance...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveThere {{has been}} limited study {{of all types of}} food stores, such as {{traditional}} (supercenters, supermarkets, and grocery stores), convenience stores, and non-traditional (dollar stores, mass merchandisers, and pharmacies) as potential opportunities for purchase of fresh and processed (canned and frozen) fruits and vegetables, especially in small-town or rural areas. MethodsData from the Brazos Valley Food Environment Project (BVFEP) are combined with 2000 U. S. Census data for 101 Census block groups (CBG) to examine neighborhood access to fruits and vegetables. BVFEP data included identification and geocoding of all food stores (n = 185) in six rural counties in Texas, using ground-truthed methods and on-site assessment of the availability and variety of fresh and <b>processed</b> <b>fruits</b> and vegetables in all food stores. Access from the population-weighted centroid of each CBG was measured using proximity (minimum network distance) and coverage (number of shopping opportunities) for a good selection of fresh and <b>processed</b> <b>fruits</b> and vegetables. Neighborhood inequalities (deprivation and vehicle ownership) and spatial access for fruits and vegetables were examined using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test and multivariate regression models. ResultsThe variety of fruits or vegetables was greater at supermarkets compared with grocery stores. Among non-traditional and convenience food stores, the largest variety was found at dollar stores. On average, rural neighborhoods were 9. 9 miles to the nearest supermarket, 6. 7 miles and 7. 4 miles to the nearest food store with a good variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, respectively, and 4. 7 miles and 4. 5 miles to a good variety of fresh and <b>processed</b> <b>fruits</b> or vegetables. High deprivation or low vehicle ownership neighborhoods had better spatial access to a good variety of fruits and vegetables, both in the distance to the nearest source and in the number of shopping opportunities.
