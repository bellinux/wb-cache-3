The {{unreasonable}} airflow distribution often {{occurs in}} the <b>cold</b> <b>store.</b> Some specific parameters of airflow in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> are difficult to obtain in the practical experiments. The unreasonable airflow causes quality decline and large energy consumption. In this paper, the airflow distributions in an empty commercial <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> and the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> filled with products were studied by CFD and investigated using the 3 D modeling method which combined SIMPLE calculation method and finite-volume method. Meshes of the fan were refined locally with the airflow near the walls was modified by applying the non-wall function. Through comparing the airflow distributions in the empty <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> and in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> filled with products, differences such as the lower margin velocity, the smaller width and the deviation of the main steam in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> filled with products were found...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Air {{curtains}} {{are commonly}} used to cut off air flow between the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> and hot environment, and reduce heat and mass transfer {{in order to maintain}} the low temperature in the <b>cold</b> <b>store.</b> CFD can be used to predict operation rule of air curtain used in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> intuitively and modelling is the most important part of numerical simulation of air curtain used in the <b>cold</b> <b>store.</b> In this study, different numerical models including standard εκ − model (with and without boussinesq approximation) and RSM (with and without boussinesq approximation) were used to simulate the temperature field and air flow field in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> and operation rule of air curtain used in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> after air curtain opened for 60 s. Meanwhile, the actual operation of air curtain used in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> was tested and the simulation values were compared with the experimental values. The results showed that the velocity of the central mainstream decayed slowly, but the velocity of both sides of air curtain decayed fast. The optimal model used to predict the temperature field and air flow field in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> and operation rule of air curtain used in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> was standard εκ − model with boussinesq approximation, the relative error was within 20 %. The optimal model can be used to predict the temperature field and air flow field in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> during different times in the future research...|$|R

The {{quantity}} of the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> {{in our country}} has been rapidly rising since the 1990 s, however, the flow field in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> is difficult to obtain accurately by experiments. With reference to the experiences in previous numerical simulations in this paper, CFD is used for analyzing two forms of return air in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> with the Finite Volume Methods and the SIMPLE Revised. As a result, Combined with the non-equilibrium wall function, {{it is found that}} taking the way of return air {{on both sides of the}} fan is more reasonable and the cooling consumption of the empty <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> can be saved before the products enter the <b>cold</b> <b>store.</b> Furthermore, the numerical simulation results can provide reference for choosing fans in the small <b>cold</b> <b>store...</b>|$|R

40|$|Two {{benchmarking}} {{surveys were}} created {{to collect data on}} the performance of chilled, frozen and mixed (chilled and frozen stores operated from a single refrigeration system) food <b>cold</b> <b>stores</b> with the aim of identifying the major factors influencing energy consumption. The volume of the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> was found to have the greatest relationship with energy use with none of the other factors collected having any significant impact on energy use. For chilled <b>cold</b> <b>stores,</b> 93 % of the variation in energy was related to store volume. For frozen stores, 56 % and for mixed stores, 67 % of the variation in energy consumption was related to store volume. The results also demonstrated the large variability in performance of <b>cold</b> <b>stores.</b> This was investigated using a mathematical model to predict energy use under typical <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> construction, usage and efficiency scenarios. The model demonstrated that store shape factor (which had a major impact on surface area of the stores), usage and to a lesser degree ambient temperature all had an impact on energy consumption.

The SIMPLE algorithm and Boussineq assumption were used and the turbulent intensity was also set. The numerical simulation results reflected that the temperature distribution was closer to the previous experimental results after using new method. The error between simulation values and experimental values was decreased. The simulation result showed that temperature of corner was highest in the <b>cold</b> <b>store.</b> The temperature change of the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> in the cooling process could be better predicted by using modified simulation method and the accuracy of numerical simulation of <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> in the cooling process could also be validated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To get the air {{distribution}} {{in a small}} <b>cold</b> <b>store,</b> a mini type <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> (4. 5 m (l) × 3. 3 m (w) × 2. 5 m (h)) was referenced. The model of the small <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> {{was established in the}} software named GAMBIT and after this the three-dimensional numerical simulation was used. The different simulation result was verified by the experiments. The accuracy of simulation in airflow field in <b>cold</b> <b>stores</b> was studied by comparison of various mesh rezoning, various decoupling methods for airflow speed and pressure. The results showed that 10 cm dimensional accuracy was the suitable mesh size for the calculation speed without affecting the simulation accuracy, and the SIMPLE algorithm was better for the PISQ algorithms to simulate steady air flow of the cooling process in a <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> without products. It was concluded that there was a large circumfluence in the flow field, the speeds in the center and corner were lower than those in other places. The distribution of flow speed in the horizontal plane had a good symmetrical, however that in the vertical plane was lower than that in the center, but higher upwards and downwards. The study validated 3 D CFD simulation technology for the small <b>cold</b> <b>store.</b> The results of the research offered the optimized methods of using CFD and acted as the reference of the simulation model in the <b>cold</b> <b>store...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective of the {{research}} was to determine ambient temperature and relative humidity distributions of two different <b>cold</b> <b>stores</b> which have two different cooling systems. One of the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> which is called as Cold store-I, has classical cooling system such as compressor, condenser and evaporator. Second called Cold store-II, has air conditioning system for cooling, cold air ventilation and aspiration systems, and humidification system. Computational fluid dynamics was used for modelling of distribution of temperature and relative humidity of <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> walls. Storage temperature and relative humidity were assumed 2 °C and 90 %, respectively. Boundary conditions were set as; Inlet-Surface of fluid inlet, Outlet-Surface of fluid outlet, and walls-solid, proof against flow of fluid. A tetrahedral mesh was created by using ANSYS 14. 0 and calculation finished when accessing a solution. Turbulence was modelled using the k-ɛ (k-epsilon). Spatial distribution in two <b>cold</b> <b>stores</b> for two different cooling systems were modelled and evaluated in this research.

Less than 13 % of chilled and 12 % of frozen stores used less energy than an efficiently used store with an efficient refrigeration system. The model indicated that smaller stores of less than 25, 000 m 3 tended to use more energy than the model predicted, even at the least efficient, highest usage scenario. With further validation the model could be used to benchmark the energy usage of <b>cold</b> <b>stores</b> and help identify where energy savings could be best achieved...|$|R
