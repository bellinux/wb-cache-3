Protein fractions were subsequently extracted as albumin, globulin, urea and SDS-soluble proteins, by different methods. The results showed that albumin and globulin fractions represent the major constituents in different <b>pollen</b> <b>pellets</b> and amounted 33. 24 - 40. 3 % and 32. 57 - 37. 22 % respectively. SDS soluble protein showed minor amount. The electrophoretic separation of albumin and globulin extracts of sunflower pollen showed the presence of 8 protein subunits, which varied in their molecular weight between 4 - 67 KiloDalton (KDa); allergic protein subunits with MW 35 and 45 KDa were identified in all <b>pollen</b> <b>pellets</b> tested. Indexing and general analysis of the four <b>pollen</b> <b>pellets</b> showed that carbohydrates ranged from 28. 12 (maize) to 36. 12 (sunflower), while total chlorophyll ranged from 5. 85 (broad bean) to 6. 07 (maize) mg/ 100 g fresh weight. It {{is also clear that}} the protein content of <b>pollen</b> <b>pellets</b> is above 40 % and therefore they could be considered as a protein rich source. Broad bean pellets had the highest amount of protein content (48. 31 %). The lipid content ranged from 4. 47 to 15. 7 %, according to pollen source. All <b>pollen</b> <b>pellets</b> contained relatively high quantities of RNA, which are nearly three times the equivalent of DNA content.

30|$|The {{results of}} the {{microscopic}} analysis of the <b>pollen</b> <b>pellets</b> demonstrated that bees collected maize pollen at all sites, in 2007 and 2008. Although maize pollen is not the main food source (2007 : 0.1 – 0.3  %; 2008 : 2 – 3  %) the collection efficiency of the bee colonies resulted in high amounts of sampled maize pollen with 4 to 11 million per site in 2007 and up to 467 million in 2008. Molecular-biological analysis of maize pollen DNA by qPCR demonstrated that transgenic Bt-MON 810 DNA was present in all technical and biological samples, corroborated by two independent laboratories. In 2007, the GMO-content in the samples ranged up to 44  % in the bioaerosols and 49  % in the <b>pollen</b> <b>pellets.</b> In 2008, GMO-proportions of up to 18  % were detected.|$|E

30|$|The {{analyses}} revealed that at all three sampling sites (I–III) maize pollen was collected by honey-bees. Site I and II were located within the nature reserve. Sampling site III was surrounded by maize fields and, thus, reflects a maximum input of maize pollen. Although there was a rich supply of competitive flowering plants, especially in the nature reserve, the bees chose maize blossoms and collected pollen. The amount of collected pollen varied by day and by bee colony. There were <b>pollen</b> <b>pellets</b> containing 100  % maize pollen as well as <b>pollen</b> <b>pellets</b> without any maize pollen, and samples that ranged between these extremes. The daily course of pollen sampling indicates that maize pollen was collected by honey-bees especially during bad weather conditions when no other pollen was available. In 2007, the maximum percentage of maize pollen in a daily sample (20  %) was found at sampling location III on July 26 th {{at the end of}} a cold, damp weather period. In some of the <b>pollen</b> <b>pellets</b> no maize pollen was found, especially during the middle of August when a lot of plants other than maize were flowering intensely and the maize bloom decreased. Accordingly, in these days the amount of maize pollen was very low. The relative portion of maize pollen to total pollen varied between < 0.1  % up to 20  % in the daily samples and between 0.1  % and 0.3  % in the overall samples. At site I, the overall sample of pellets contained 1.77 million maize pollen resulting in an amount of 4.0 million maize pollen for the seasonal collection in 2007. At site II, 3.76 million maize pollen were found in the overall sample resulting in an amount of 8.5 million maize pollen for the season. At site III the overall sample contained 4.8 million maize pollen resulting in an amount of 11.0 million maize pollen for the season.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} DNA barcoding effectiveness to characterize honeybee <b>pollen</b> <b>pellets,</b> a food supplement largely used for human nutrition {{due to its}} therapeutic properties. We collected <b>pollen</b> <b>pellets</b> using modified beehives placed in three zones within an alpine protected area (Grigna Settentrionale Regional Park, Italy). A DNA barcoding reference database, including rbcL and trnH-psbA sequences from 693 plant species (104 sequenced in this study) was assembled. The database was used to identify pollen collected from the hives. Fifty-two plant species were identified at the molecular level. Results suggested rbcL alone could not distinguish among congeneric plants; however, psbA-trnH identified most of the pollen samples at the species level. Substantial variability in pollen composition was observed between the highest elevation locality (Alpe Moconodeno), characterized by arid grasslands and a rocky substrate, {{and the other two}} sites (Cornisella and Ortanella) at lower altitudes. Pollen from Ortanella and Cornisella showed the presence of typical deciduous forest species; however in samples collected at Ortanella, pollen of the invasive Lonicera japonica, and the ornamental Pelargonium x hortorum were observed. Our results indicated pollen composition was largely influenced by floristic local biodiversity, plant phenology, and the presence of alien flowering species.

30|$|The {{homogenised}} <b>pollen</b> <b>pellet</b> samples (2.3. 1) {{were treated}} by separation methods differentiating in size using a wet sieving cascade system (Fritsch Analysette Pro, metal meshes and micro wet sieving, sieves of 10  cm diameter). Stepwise wet sieving was applied with mesh widths of 180  µm, 125  µm, and 60  µm to concentrate the maize pollen {{in the sample}} fraction 60 – 125  µm. This sample fraction was sieved until the suspension was transparent, transferred to a 500 -ml Erlenmeyer flacon, mixed and distributed equally to 50 -ml centrifugation tubes (e.[*]g. Greiner). After centrifugation (2, 000 rpm, 5 min) the water volume in the tubes was reduced nearly to the sediment containing the maize pollen fraction, filled up by 50  % glycerol and mixed. 500  µl of the suspension were used for microscopic analysis to control {{the quality and quantity}} of the maize pollen and total pollen contents. The majority of the maize pollen was intact in all samples. Representative subsamples of 2  ml were stored at – 18  °C until subsequent PCR analysis.|$|R
40|$|Pollen {{collected}} from flowers by forager bees {{is the only}} natural protein source for the hive. This nutritional compound is fundamental for the nurse bee and brood development, and for the queen activity. Pollen has a strong influence on colony health. It is also known that the pollen quality, {{in terms of the}} amino acid profile and total protein content, varies significantly according to the floral origin. For this reason, the palynological diversity assessed in corbicular pollen is a good measure {{of the quality of the}} environment the bees live in, in terms of available food. An international research initiative “C. S. I. Pollen” aims to elaborate a pollen diversity map for all of Europe, carried out by beekeepers. Chromatic assessment of pellet colours will be used as a method. In our study, we wanted to validate this idea, through the comparison between the two methods: chromatic assessment of the diversity of <b>pollen</b> <b>pellet</b> colours and palynological assessment of the real pollen type diversity.

40|$|In {{this study}} we reinvestigated the {{kinetics}} of allergen release from birch pollen (Betula verrucosa) and timothy grass pollen (Phleum pratense) using different protein extraction procedures, immunoblotting with specific antibodies and immune electron microscopy. Pollen allergens such as the major birch pollen allergen, Bet v I, the major timothy grass pollen allergens, Phl p I and Phl p V, group-II/III allergens from timothy grass and profilins were released rapidly and in large amounts from hydrated pollen. Within a few minutes pollen allergens could be detected in aqueous supernatants prepared from birch and grass pollen with serum IgE or specific antibodies. In parallel the allergen content in the <b>pollen</b> <b>pellet</b> fractions decreased. A nonallergenic protein such as heat shock protein 70 can be extracted in sufficient amounts only with harsh extraction procedures. Immune electron microscopy of dry and rehydrated birch pollens showed that after short hydration, the major birch pollen allergen, Bet v I, migrated into the exine and {{to the surface of}} intact pollen grains, whereas profilin, against which a lower percentage of patients is sensitized, was retained in the pollen grain. Comparing the amino acid composition and hydrophilicity of the tested allergens with a nonallergenic protein such as heat shock protein 70, no significant difference was noted.

40|$|On 6 th and 7 th of February 2014, 26 {{researchers}} {{attended a}} workshop in Graz, Austria.

All participants welcomed the initiative and agreed that the pollen nutrition of honey bees is of great importance for colony health and survival, and needs to be adequately studied. A means to study the biodiversity of pollen in the supply of honey bee colonies on a large scale is through the involvement of beekeepers as Citizen Scientists (C. S.). As beekeepers cannot perform full palynological analyses, we have developed a simple estimation of pollen diversity according to the colour of corbicular <b>pollen</b> <b>pellets.</b> This allows us to obtain information on a large number of samples, but also requires standardized protocols in all participating countries. National coordinators from the following countries agreed to conduct a common investigation in 2014 and 2015 using the protocols developed for C. S. I. Pollen in pilot studies in 2013 : National coordinators of the following countries were present: Austria, Croatia, Denmark, England, France, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Scotland, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Wales. We will re-evaluate the protocols after one year, and also invite other countries to join. As a second step, samples collected by the beekeeper can be analysed to connect pollen diversity derived from colour differentiation of <b>pollen</b> <b>pellets,</b> to the number of plant species identified by palynological analysis. The funding for this second level investigation is to be left to the national coordinators. Traditional melissopalynological methods are not as suitable for the analysis of corbicular <b>pollen</b> <b>pellets</b> compared to honey, so standardized methods for this will be developed.

Analysis of the honey produced in hives as well as the stored pollen loads help to evaluate the sources of nectar and pollen used by honey bees and their behavioural pattern in the selection of preferences for certain plants as food. Our previous melissopalynology study focused on the analysis of the Omani honey from hives in 14 locations of Muscat and the Al Batinah regions. Our current study examines the <b>pollen</b> <b>pellets</b> collected from those same areas. A total of 249 <b>pollen</b> <b>pellets</b> from 22 honeycombs that were collected by Apis florea and Apis mellifera honeybees were processed and the pollen types were identified using light and scanning electron microscopy. Each pollen load was designated as a unifloral, bifloral or multifloral type. Each plant taxon identified was categorized as being utilized by honeybees for pollen only, nectar only or for both pollen and nectar. A pollen reference collection of 105 local flowering plants was prepared that enabled us to identify most of the pollen types. The quantification of 94 pollen types revealed that 67 of them belonged to 39 plant families, all of which are represented in both the pollen loads and the honey samples. Seven pollen genera were found in the pollen loads only and suggest that those plants were visited by bees just for pollen. Twenty pollen types appear only in the honey samples and suggest that bees visited them only for nectar. Major bee foraging plant species include: Ziziphus spina-christi, Acacia tortilis, Prosopis cineraria, Prosopis juliflora, Maerua crassifolia, Citrus spp., Zygophyllum spp. and Fagonia spp. These data provide a guide to the optimal utilization of floral resources by honeybees in these regions...|$|E

The comparison of pollen in corbicular loads and garbage pellets indicates that garbage pollen is derived from both feces of pollen-consuming workers and larval feces (meconia).

The percentage of Bt-maize MON 810 <b>pollen</b> in the <b>pellet</b> samples declined from 49  % in 2007 to 1.9  % in 2008. The values for both samples at site I were pretty close (1.2  %, 2.5  %). A similar result was observed in the bioaerosol samples. The percentage of Bt-maize pollen decreased from 31  % in 2007 to 8  % in 2008. Comparing both surveys, these findings reflect the greater distance of the samplers to the next Bt-maize field due to the increased buffer zones (100  m in 2007, > 250  m in 2008). In 2008, 12  % Bt-maize pollen was found by technical sampling at site II at a distance of 80  m to the next maize field margin, whereas in 2007 the percentage was 16  % at a distance of 60  m. At site IV the percentage of Bt-maize pollen was 18  %. Both sites (site II + IV) were situated closer to the next Bt-maize field and in a different direction to site I, possibly leading to the higher fraction of GMO pollen. The pollen sample (PMF sampler) at site III contained 34  % Bt-maize MON 810 and was located in the proximity of a Bt-maize field.

40|$|Although overall {{pollinator}} {{populations have}} declined {{over the last}} couple of decades, the honey bee (Apis mellifera) malady, colony collapse disorder (CCD), has caused major concern in the agricultural community. Among honey bee pathogens, RNA viruses are emerging as a serious threat and are suspected as major contributors to CCD. Recent detection of these viral species in bumble bees suggests a possible wider environmental spread of these viruses with potential broader impact. It is therefore vital to study the ecology and epidemiology of these viruses in the hymenopteran pollinator community as a whole. We studied the viral distribution in honey bees, in their pollen loads, and in other non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators collected from flowering plants in Pennsylvania, New York, and Illinois in the United States. Viruses in the samples were detected using reverse transcriptase-PCR and confirmed by sequencing. For the first time, we report the molecular detection of picorna-like RNA viruses (deformed wing virus, sacbrood virus and black queen cell virus) in <b>pollen</b> <b>pellets</b> collected directly from forager bees. <b>Pollen</b> <b>pellets</b> from several uninfected forager bees were detected with virus, indicating that pollen itself may harbor viruses. The viruses in the pollen and honey stored in the hive were demonstrated to be infective, with the queen becoming infected and laying infected eggs after these virus-contaminated foods were given to virus-free colonies. These viruses were detected in eleven other non-Apis hymenopteran species, ranging from many solitary bees to bumble bees and wasps. This finding further expands the viral host range and implies a possible deeper impact on the health of our ecosystem. Phylogenetic analyses support that these viruses are disseminating freely among the pollinators via the flower pollen itself. Notably, in cases where honey bee apiaries affected by CCD harbored honey bees with Israeli Acute Paralysis virus (IAPV), nearby non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators also had IAPV, while those near apiaries without IAPV did not. In containment greenhouse experiments, IAPV moved from infected honey bees to bumble bees and from infected bumble bees to honey bees within a week, demonstrating that the viruses could be transmitted from one species to another. This study adds to our present understanding of virus epidemiology and may help explain bee disease patterns and pollinator population decline in general...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe studied {{resource}} use and competition by varieties of a honey bee, Apis mellifera, through re-introducing European A. m. ligustica in experimental apiaries in a habitat 'saturated' by African (or hybrid African and European) honey bees that naturally colonized {{forest in the}} Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. Over 171 pollen species comprised honey bee diets. The Morisita-Horn similarity index (highest similarity = 1. 0) between the two honey bee races was 0. 76 for pollen use and, from the average daily volume usage by colonies of each bee subspecies, 0. 55 for taxon-specific intensity of use. Although using more plant species, the European bee specialized much more heavily on a few plants than did African honey bees. By re-analysis of <b>pollen</b> <b>pellets</b> collected by locally-adapted (Mexican) European honey bees for one year, at the same experimental sites and using the same pollen traps as our studies, {{before the arrival of}} invasive honey bees in S. Mexico, we infer that resident bees may respond to exotic honey bee competition by shifting flower choice and by increasing resource specialization. We also show that replicated, quantitative pollen analysis is a powerful tool that may be applied to understanding diet diversity of bees...|$|E
40|$|Honey bee health {{depends on}} various factors, {{including}} {{the availability of}} food resources andchronic exposure to toxins in the foraging area. These parameters can be evaluated using indicators based on either pollen gathered to the hive or landscape features of the foraging area, including the structure, land use, or density of such specific landscape elements as hedgerows. This study examines {{the correlation between the}} diversity of pollens gathered and the landscape features in a 3 -km radius using Geographic Information System technology. Palynological analyses were performed on <b>pollen</b> <b>pellets</b> collected from sixteen apiaries in western France during one year. Richness, diversity and similarity indices werecalculated for land-cover features and palynological data and then compared. The land-cover analyses permitted the identification of three different landscape contexts (hedgerow, cultivated, and urban landscapes). Although the palynological profiles were highly diverse, some taxa were conserved between hives. The flower richness was greater in the apiaries from urban landscapes than in apiaries from rurallandscapes, regardless of the dominant land-cover. The statistical analysis did not associate a specific flora with a specific landscape. However, it was possible to distinguish the pollen gathered by bees in urban landscapes and from pollen collected in rural area...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the polliniferous floral sources used by Apis mellifera (L.) (africanized) in an apiary situated in Pará de Minas, Minas Gerais state, and evaluate the pollen prefences among the beehives. Two beehives of Langstroth type with frontal pollen trap collectors were used. The harvest was made from September 2007 to March 2008, with three samples of <b>pollen</b> <b>pellets</b> colected per month per beehive. The subsamples of 2 grams each were prepared according to the European standard melissopalynological method. A total of 56 pollen types were observed, identifying 43 genus and 32 families. The families that showed the major richness of pollen types were: Mimosaceae (8), Asteraceae (6), Fabaceae (3), Arecaceae (3), Euphorbiaceae (3), Rubiaceae (3), Caesalpiniaceae (2), Moraceae (2) and Myrtaceae (2). The most frequent pollen types (> 45 %) were Mimosa scabrella, Myrcia and Sorocea. The results demonstrated a similarity regarding the preferences of floral sources during the major part of the time. There was a distinct utilization of floral sources among the pollen types of minor frequency. In spite of the strong antropic influence, the region showed a great polliniferous variety, which was an indicative of the potential for monofloral as well as heterofloral pollen production...|$|E
