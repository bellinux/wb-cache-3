The between-firm mobility model introduced here is establishing the benchmark for optimal transitions. Furthermore, some generalizations are appropriate to explain the coex-istence of wage reductions and wage markups in the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>mobility,</b> as reviewed in the literature. The empirical investigation of the model, based on German linked employer-employee data, checks whether the between-firm wage trajectory exceeds the within-firm wage path.

40|$|Open-air {{sites are}} {{ubiquitous}} signatures on most archaeological landscapes. When they are appropriately recorded, well-preserved and are single-component occupations, they {{provide access to}} high-resolution occupation data that is often not available from rock-shelter sites. These sites are, however, commonly affected {{by a number of}} post-depositional factors that are not adequately studied in archaeology. This paper presents the results of an open-air experiment conducted in northeastern Botswana. Two surface scatters modelled on known Bushman open-air camp sites were created to investigate the taphonomic factors affecting such sites. The scattered materials at these sites included stone tools, ostrich eggshell fragments, ceramic sherds, glass beads and faunal remains. Two scatters were laid out consisting of a nested square design; one site was excavated after four months and the other after twelve. The results show little horizontal material movement at these scatters and an initial, rapid, vertical <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>mobility,</b> after which the majority of surface artefacts are protected from subsequent movement, preserving the general scatter structures. This experiment suggests that open-air sites can offer detailed spatial information relevant to human settlement structure that is often not accessible at rock-shelter sites.

40|$|Gonyostomum semen (Raphidophyceae) {{is today}} {{one of the}} most common flagellates in humic lakes ill Sweden and appears {{regularly}} in 30 % of these lakes. The first mass development of this alga was recorded in 1948 in Lake Helgasjon, South Sweden. In this paper the life cycle of Gonyostomum is described for the first time. During the winter Gonyostomum survived as resting cysts on the surface of the bottom sediment. In spring (April to May) meiosis took place in the cysts, and on excystment two haploid gametes appeared. After a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>mobility,</b> the gametes formed pairs. The gametes then fused, and a new diploid Gonyostomum cell developed. The vegetative stage of Gonyostomum, which was seen during the summer period (May-October), is thus the diploid phase. During this period normal, longitudinal cell division took place. Under unfavourable conditions, temporary cysts Could be formed. Cyst formation started from the centre of the cell, which swelled and became spherical. This was a thin-walled, temporary cyst, which was mobile and, like ordinary cells, had one flagellum protruding forward and one trailing behind. The temporary cysts could accumulate and settle in large clusters where the flagella were lost or had become invisible. When favourable conditions reappeared, the temporary cysts divided and formed two new gametes. In autumn, when the water temperature decreased to below about 10 degrees C, the temporary cysts went into dormancy and became resting cysts. The cyst wall thickened, and a brown body appeared within the cyst. Below 4 - 6 degrees C no vegetative cells were found...|$|E

During June–September 2000, we compared diel movements of six adult S. salpa (249 – 317 mm FL and 313 – 633 g) in the Bay of Calvi. These fish were tagged by intraperitoneal insertion of ultrasonic transmitters. Their positions were recorded with a directional hydrophone from a small boat with an accuracy between 10 and 50 m, depending on the local environment. The tracking duration ranged from 3 to 22 days (average 11. 8 ± 7. 3). Locations were performed from at least dawn to dusk or early night, and one fish was tracked during the entire 24 -h cycle. Fish were more mobile during the twilight periods, but statistical analysis indicated individual differences for the precise <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>mobility.</b> Two major behavioural patterns were observed: first, the fish remained in close vicinity of the harbour during the day and moved away to the north or the south at dusk to access nocturnal sites, occupying a home range of about 4. 3 ha.

40|$|Nowadays, city {{local governments}} focus their {{strategic}} vision {{on the development}} of the urban sustainability. For this, they develop drivers, strategies, structures on green local improvements. To be sustainable, cities reinforce actions and plans on resource management, mobility, climate, building and public spaces. In order to be sustainable and smart, challenges are set to ensure successful implementation of sustainable mobility strategies through the development of appropriate policies, actions, decisions and controls. The development of sustainable mobility strategy requires the involvement of strategic actors, infrastructures, funding and socio-demographic parameters. To ensure this, sustainable mobility strategy has to be strengthen by an efficient management control system and a real measurement of institutional factors’ risk. The development of mobility controls ensures homogeneity between behaviours, decisions, objectives and strategies for mobility issues. In order to make the link between control, strategy and sustainability, new researches propose new frameworks and systems. These frameworks reinforce the strategic contribution of values, rules, monitoring and enhancing awareness and interactions. Based on that, the management control framework of Malmi and Brown is more and more associated with the implementation of sustainable strategies. This paper explores the development of sustainable mobility strategies in two Belgian cities (Namur and Leuven). To analyse how cilty local governments implement, control and develop mobility strategies and plans, this paper refers to Malmi and Brown’s model. The research proposes two hypotheses that set the importance of the integration of an adequate sustainable mobility control system and the institutional factors on the design and the use of mobility strategy control. This paper proposes a new conceptual model to support the development of sustainable mobility strategy. For this, the choice of two Belgian cities is made according to similarities (population size, explicit will to develop sustainable mobility strategy, focus on sustainable transport, initiation <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>mobility</b> issues’ implementation, number of person in charge of mobility, level of willingness to develop mobility system, focus on car free and strategic mobility challenges) and differences (region, language, regulative factors, normative factors and cognitive factors). To test our conceptual framework, an explorative qualitative case study is done in these two Belgian city local governments. The data collection requires a fieldwork of 12 weeks, 54 internal and external documents, and 20 semi-structured interviews (mobility managers, politicians, sustainability managers, policemen and administrative workers). Results shows differences between the implementation and development of Namur and Leuven. Leuven has an average quality of sustainable mobility control system. Leuven requires developing new adapted indicators to face new city challenges and more effective collaborations between involved departments and actors. The case of Namur shows that its sustainable mobility control system is weak because of the non-adapted indicators to strategy and the weakness of the formal structure of mobility strategy. Results identify different institutional factors that have a significant impact {{on the development of}} sustainable mobility strategy; the most relevant are formal regulations, political power, local cultures, support of direct and indirect actors and the sensitiveness on sustainable culture. The proposed conceptual model also highlights if the impact of mobility strategy controls and institutional influences have a weak, medium or strong impact on the development of mobility strategy. Results validate our proposed conceptual model. However, this model has to be tested on other sustainability issues (energy, green building, green housing, green and neutral climate), cities and regions...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{concerns the}} economic {{history of a}} group of four Sicilian Greek settlements during the archaic period (c. 730 - 490 B. C.), Naxos, Katane, Leontinoi, and Zankle, all located on the north or east coast, and all purportedly settled by Euboians. The modern historiography on this issue has thus far prioritized the testimony of ancient literary sources, leaving archaeological evidence comparatively underutilized. The body of evidence I use to conduct this study consists primarily of the information and artifacts recovered through excavation of these sites. Such an approach deviates from modern study of the "ancient economy," and the economies of these four places in particular. The aim is to create an understanding of the early economies of these settlements, and to examine the ways in which their economies thrived and evolved through the introduction of coinage {{at the end of the}} sixth century. Naxos, Leontionoi, Katane, and Zankle were all born in a peak <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>mobility</b> and connectivity. The very existence of apoikiai such as these depended upon the movement of large numbers of people over a long distance, and their subsequent growth and success hinged in large part upon the continual movement of both people and goods over distances both long and short. However, even in the circumstance of intense redistribution fostered by the condition of hyperconnectivity, production must have remained a necessary and key component of the economy of any permanent settlement. From the moment in the archaeological record that we can detect their presence, Greek settlers at Naxos, Leontinoi, Katane, and Zankle were engaging in acts of production and redistribution. The original rationale for each individual settlement need not matter, and its consideration may in fact prove counterproductive for these understanding the structure and functioning of economic life. For the initial idea of these places, in addition to not being recoverable in any sort of reliable way, may not necessarily bear a correlation to what they eventually or even quickly became. When considering the economies of these settlements during the archaic period, the question is not whether they were fully formed and functioning systems consisting of regular and robust acts of production, redistribution and consumption, but rather how the structure of these three basic sectors of economic activity enabled, impeded, altered, or generally affected one another. This dissertation is divided into three chapters. Chapter one addresses questions of evidence, historiography, and approach. In it I discuss the merits and drawbacks of the two main categories of evidence available for the study of Greek economies in the archaic period: literary and archaeological evidence. After examining the epistemological shortcomings of heavy reliance on literary sources, I argue that previous approaches to the study of economies in the archaic Greek west have been unduly constrained by the impressions that ancient testimonia give. I examine further the modern historiography by discussing the ways in which the framing of the question through colonial analogies and comparison with modern market economics has distorted our view of ancient practice. Finally, I lay out the basic approach that I take in the remainder of the dissertation, focusing on the potential utility of combining archaeological data with assumptions about cultural and economic interactions that have been constructed [...] in particular in Horden and Purcell's The Corrupting Sea¬ [...] for understanding the unique environmental and cultural circumstances of the ancient Mediterranean. Chapter two is the empirical heart of the dissertation; in it I systematically present and describe the archaeological evidence for archaic Naxos, Leontinoi, Katane, and Zankle. The archaeological evidence is divided chronologically into two periods. The first of these covers the period c. 730 - 650, and captures the evidence for economic activity from the foundation of each settlement through the first few generations of their growth. With the second period, c. 650 - 490, I examine the evidence for the period of apparent large-scale growth that began in the second half of the seventh century, and also look at the introduction of coinage at Zankle and Naxos toward the end of the sixth century. Within each period, information is organized first by site, and then by type of context. Preliminary analysis of the data is provided, with a view toward the more synthetic discussion that is largely reserved for chapter three. Chapter three combines the results of chapters one and two, applying the assumptions laid out in the first chapter to the evidence organized in the second chapter to create a diachronic analysis of different types of economic activity at Naxos, Leontinoi, Katane, and Zankle from c. 750 to c. 490 B. C. Here the argument for the central role that connectivity played in the structure of the economies of these settlements is laid out in full. I begin by using the archaeological evidence in order to demonstrate how highly interconnected these places were. I then argue that this connectivity, because of the large and consistent volume of imported things, people, and information, had a direct impact on the structural development of the economies of the four settlements under study. Large scale participation in the wider world of redistribution became the preferred means of risk management, which in turn may have led to an increase of specialization in local production choices, both agricultural and otherwise. I also use the evidence of the early coinages of Naxos and Zankle in order to argue for the prevalence of regional economic transactions within the larger scheme of mobility and connectivity in which these places existed...|$|E

Firstly, there is the marked increase of Indian migrants, shifting from the earlier professionals to a dominance of student-migrants. The India-born in Australia are the fourth largest overseas born group. Secondly, remittances flow two ways in families between Australia and India. Thirdly, family communication across borders has become instantaneous and frequent, changing the experience of migration, family and money. Fourthly, mobility replaces the earlier assumption of settlement. Recent migrants hope to settle, but the large group who have come to study face a long <b>period</b> <b>of</b> precarious <b>mobility.</b> Lastly, recent migrants re-imagine the joint family in Australia, buying homes to accommodate siblings and parents. This is changing the contours of some major cities in Australia...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether sub-bandage graduated compression of 30 - 40 mmHg at the ankle was sustained and comfortable when wearing inelastic short stretch bandage systems over a 72 hour bandage wear time period. Thirty two healthy participants were used to determine the compression levels achieved by wearing a three layer inelastic compression bandage system on one leg as compared to a four layer inelastic compression bandage system on the other leg. An experienced bandager applied all bandage systems to all participants. Sub-bandage measurements were taken at spaced intervals at the ankle and the calf over the 3 day bandage wear time <b>period</b> by means <b>of</b> a non-invasive portable pneumatic monitor worn under the bandage systems. In addition, participants recorded their level of comfort against specific activities of daily living using a linear 10 point scale over the 3 days. On application, the three layer bandage system obtained a mean ankle sub-bandage pressure of 48. 12 mmHg on standing which reduced to 28. 75 mmHg at 72 hour wear time. A mean standing ankle sub-bandage pressure of 65. 74 mmHg was recorded on application for the four layer bandage system, which reduced to 35. 03 mmHg after 72 hour bandage wear time. The compression bandages caused discomfort for the participants throughout the day, both when resting/sleeping as well as during <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>mobility.</b> Participants also reported difficulties in finding shoes to accommodate the compression bandage systems. On the basis of this study’s results it is recommended that a three layer bandage system should be changed at least every 48 hours and a four layer bandage system should be changed at least every 72 hours to maintain optimal sub-bandage ankle pressures of 30 - 40 mmHg. The results also highlighted the need for an assessment tool that can be used in clinical practice to evaluate the effects that treatment interventions have on the quality of life of patients...|$|R
40|$|Long-term outdoor {{localization}} remains challenging {{due to the}} high energy profiles of GPS modules. Duty cycling the GPS module combined with inertial sensors can improve energy consumption. However, inertial sensors that are kept active all the time can also drain mobile node batteries. This paper proposes duty cycling strategies for inertial sensors to maintain a target position accuracy and node lifetime. We present a method for duty cycling motion sensors according to features of movement events, and evaluate its energy and accuracy profile for an empirical data trace of cattle movement. We further introduce the concept of group-based duty cycling, where nodes that cluster together can share the burden of motion detection to reduce their duty cycles. Our evaluation shows that both variants of motion sensor duty cycling yield up to 78 % improvement in overall node power consumption, and that the group-based method yields an additional 20 % power reduction during <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> low <b>mobility...</b>|$|R
40|$|Trends in inter-generational {{economic}} mobility in Finland {{are analyzed}} using panel data from 1950 through 1999 {{on more than}} 200 thousand sons and daughters born between 1930 and 1970. A significant decline is estimated in the inter-generational transmission elasticity from the 1930 birth cohort until the baby boom cohorts of the early 1950 s. After that we observe no increase in the extent <b>of</b> <b>mobility</b> for 1950 s and 1960 s birth cohorts. The result holds both for sons and daughters. The quite dramatic transformation of the Finnish economy {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century is outlined in the paper. However, a decomposition of the inter-generational transmission elasticities across cohorts shows that most of the decline in transmission reflected a reduction in the impact of family income on duration of children’s education accompanied by a decline in the returns to schooling. Despite the large volume of rural–urban migration during this <b>period</b> <b>of</b> transformation, regional <b>mobility</b> played only a minor role in increasing economic mobility. Inter-generational mobility, cohorts, education, migration...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} {{clinical trial}} was to compare peri-implant clinical and radiographic parameters following the placement of nonsubmerged two- and one-stage implants. Materials and Methods: Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} the IMZ group (20 patients receiving two IMZ two-stage implants in a one-stage procedure) or ITI group (20 patients receiving two ITI implants in the conventional one-stage procedure). The healing period was defined as an 18 -week unloaded osseointegration period and a 1 -year functional period during which maturation of bone took place. Twelve weeks after implant placement, fabrication of an overdenture with a bar-clip attachment system was started; it was placed at 18 weeks. Results: None of the implants were lost during the osseointegration period; one IMZ implant was removed during the functional <b>period</b> because <b>of</b> <b>mobility.</b> There {{was no significant difference in}} Gingival Index between the two groups at all evaluation periods. The mean bone loss during the functional period was 0. 6 mm in both groups. A high number of healing abutments loosened in the IMZ group. Conclusion: Clinical and radiographic parameters of two-stage implants placed in a one-stage procedure and one-stage implants are comparable during the healing <b>period.</b> Healing abutments <b>of</b> the IMZ implant system loosen easily...|$|R
