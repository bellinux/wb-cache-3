40|$|The {{deregulation}} of the Swedish electricity market in 1996 affected both the market design and the pricing of electricity. Since 1996, the electricity price faced by consumers has increased dramatically. Due to the high electricity price and large company profits, a debate about {{the success of the}} deregulation has emerged. As such, the aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate whether or not the {{deregulation of}} the Swedish electricity market has improved consumers’ welfare. The theoretical framework is an equivalent variation method and the analysis is performed using monthly data for the period January 1996 to January 2007.

40|$|A {{technical}} and economic assessment is being conducted of a hydrogen fuel dispensing station {{to develop an}} understanding of the infrastructure requirements for supplying hydrogen fuel for mobile applications. The study includes a process design of a conceptual small-scale, stand-alone, grassroots fuel dispensing facility (similar to the present-day gasoline stations) producing hydrogen by steam reforming of natural gas. Other hydrogen production processes (such as partial oxidation of hydrocarbons and water electrolysis) were reviewed to determine their suitability for manufacturing the hydrogen. The study includes an assessment of the environmental and other regulatory permitting requirements likely to be imposed on a hydrogen fuel dispensing station for transportation vehicles. The assessment concludes that a dispensing station designed to produce 0. 75 million standard cubic feet of fuel grade (99. 99 %+ purity) hydrogen will meet the fuel needs of 300 light-duty vehicles per day. Preliminary economics place the total capital investment (in 1994 US dollars) for the dispensing station at $ 4. 5 million and the annual operating costs at around $ 1 million. A discounted cash-flow analysis indicates that the fuel hydrogen product <b>price</b> (<b>excluding</b> <b>taxes)</b> to range between $ 1. 37 to $ 2. 31 per pound of hydrogen, depending upon the natural gas price, the plant financing scenario, and the rate of return on equity capital.

40|$|Austria {{has always}} been among the OECD {{countries}} with the highest net petrol prices. Compared to Germany, annual average <b>prices</b> (<b>excluding</b> <b>taxes)</b> in 1998 were higher by 30 percent for Eurosuper, and by 27 percent for diesel. In Austria, petrol prices were weaker in their response to changes in crude oil prices than in Germany. Like the high level per se, the "inertia" is {{due to lack of}} price competition. The major petrol companies have so far competed primarily on the basis of advertising, service quality, product design and new products. Market shares were, at least partly, safeguarded by subsidising petrol stations with weak sales, a strategy that delayed structural adjustment in the distribution system and prevented significant cost cuttings. In competing against discounters the major companies responded mainly with a single strategy: when a discounter attempted to woo shares away by offering low prices, branded petrol stations similarly cut their prices, so that the discounter was unable to achieve the sales growth rates required for fixed cost regression. When the petrol prices were released from price control by the government in 1981, attempts were made to harmonise the net price level in Austria with average prices in the western neighbour countries by way of agreements {{between the government and the}} petroleum industry. The 1990 agreement between the minister of economic affairs and the oil industry ("glass pockets"), however, produced no measurable change in the pricing process. The agreement of March 1999, on the other hand, put a noticeable damper on price increases. Between April and August 1999, prices rose by ATS 0. 20 to 0. 26 less than would have been expected if terms had not been changed. The net price level for super declined by 7. 5 percent.

40|$|Crude {{and refined}} {{oil prices have}} been {{relatively}} high and volatile on a sustained basis since 1999. This paper considers the pass through of oil prices into consumer liquid (i. e. petrol, diesel and heating) fuel prices in such an environment. The pass through of oil prices into consumer liquid fuel prices has already been addressed extensively in the literature. Nonetheless much of this literature has either focused on the United States or on a time period when oil prices were relatively stable, or has used monthly data. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} a comprehensive combination of many features that have been considered before but rarely jointly. These features include: (1) the analysis of the euro area as an aggregate and a large number of countries (the initial 12 member states); (2) the consideration of different time periods; (3) the modelling of the data in raw levels rather than in log levels. This turns out to have important implications for our findings; (4) the use of high frequency (weekly) data, which, as results will suggest, are the lowest frequency one should consider; (5) the investigation of the different stages of the production chain from crude oil prices to retail distribution [...] refining costs and margins, distribution and retailing costs and margins; (6) the examination of <b>prices</b> including and <b>excluding</b> <b>taxes</b> [...] excise and value-added; (7) the modelling of prices for three fuel types [...] passenger car petrol and diesel separately and home heating fuel oil; (8) lastly we also address the issue of possible asymmetries, allowing for the pass through to vary according to (a) whether price are increasing or decreasing and (b) whether price levels are above or below their equilibrium level. The main findings are as follows: First, as distribution and retailing costs and margins have been broadly stable on average, the modelling of the relationship between consumer <b>prices</b> <b>excluding</b> <b>taxes</b> and upstream <b>prices</b> in raw levels rather than in logarithms has important implications for the stability of estimates of pass through when oil price levels rise significantly. Second, considering spot prices for refined prices improves significantly the fit of the estimated models relative to using crude oil prices. It also results in more economically meaningful results concerning the extent of pass through. Third, oil price pass through occurs quickly, with 90 % occurring within three to five weeks. Fourth, using a relatively broad specification allowing for asymmetry in the pass through from upstream to downstream prices, there is little evidence of statistically significant asymmetries. Furthermore, even where asymmetry is found to be statistically significant, it is generally not economically significant. Lastly, these results generally hold across most euro area countries with few exceptions. Energy Prices Macroeconomy...|$|R

This drop is consistent with the general decrease over the last twenty years. The 2002 rate is 65 % lower than the peak in 1981. • The downward trend since 1981 may be attributable to a number of factors, including changing attitudes with respect to impaired driving, aging of the general population, as well as other enforcement procedures used by the police such as roadside suspensions. • Among provinces, {{the rate of}} persons charged with impaired driving ranged from 183 per 100, 000 persons aged 16 and older in Newfoundland and Labrador to 618 in Saskatchewan. • With the exception of Quebec which reported no change in the rate of persons charged with impaired driving, all provinces and territories reported decreases in 2002. Among provinces, Newfoundland and Labrador had the largest decrease (- 19 %) followed by New Brunswick (- 12 %) and Saskatchewan (- 11 %). • The rate of persons accused of impaired driving offences was highest among young adults between the ages of 19 and 24 and lowest for those 65 and over. • The rate of overall Criminal Code traffic incidents that involved fatalities or bodily harm has generally declined over the past 15 years. • Almost three-quarters (73 %) of court cases involving impaired driving resulted in a conviction and of these 14 % were sentenced to custody. 2 Statistics Canada – Catalogue no. 85 - 002, Vol. 23, no. 9 Ordering and subscription information All <b>prices</b> <b>exclude</b> sales <b>tax</b> This product, Catalogue no. 85 - 002 -XPE, is published as a standard printed publication at a price of CDN $ 11. 00 per issue and CDN $ 100. 00 for a one-year subscription.

40|$|Biomass is a {{renewable}} energy resource that can be converted into liquid fuel suitable for transportation applications. As a widely available biomass form, lignocellulosic biomass can {{have a major impact}} on domestic transportation fuel supplies and thus help meet the Energy Independence and Security Act {{renewable energy}} goals (U. S. Congress 2007). With gasification technology, biomass can be converted to gasoline via methanol synthesis and methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) technologies. Producing a gasoline product that is infrastructure ready has much potential. Although the MTG technology has been commercially demonstrated with natural gas conversion, combining MTG with biomass gasification has not been shown. Therefore, a techno-economic evaluation for a biomass MTG process based on currently available technology was developed to provide information about benefits and risks of this technology. The economic assumptions used in this report are consistent with previous U. S. Department of Energy Office of Biomass Programs techno-economic assessments. The feedstock is assumed to be wood chips at 2000 metric ton/day (dry basis). Two kinds of gasification technologies were evaluated: an indirectly-heated gasifier and a directly-heated oxygen-blown gasifier. The gasoline selling <b>prices</b> (2008 USD) <b>excluding</b> <b>taxes</b> were estimated to be $ 3. 20 /gallon and $ 3. 68 /gallon for indirectly-heated gasified and directly-heated. This suggests that a process based on existing technology is economic only when crude prices are above $ 100 /bbl. However, improvements in syngas cleanup combined with consolidated gasoline synthesis can potentially reduce the capital cost. In addition, improved synthesis catalysts and reactor design may allow increased yield...|$|R

This paper presents {{a description of the}} facility and the measurement method, as well as results from two new products of ASP, Laupen, Switzerland with 150 and 250 W(AC) output power and input voltages of 12 and 24 VDC, respectively. Both are sinusoidal-type inverters, producing grid-quality power, suitable for all applications. Maximum efficiencies of 89 and 90 % were measured, indicating large improvement in performance during the last 15 years. Both efficiencies closely agree with the manufacturer's specification of 90 and 92 %. The output voltage at nominal output power was 213 and 221 VAC, i. e. somewhat too low for the 12 VDC inverter. The standby losses were found to be 1. 8 and 3. 3 W, respectively. The latter is 32 % higher than specified by the manufacturer. Improvements are suggested regarding the reduction of losses and the cooling of the transistors. The question as to whether pulsating current withdrawal from battery storage, caused by sinusoidal inverters, has a negative impact on the battery's lifetime, cannot be answered from the tests performed so far. The specific retail <b>prices</b> (<b>excluding</b> Value Added <b>Tax,</b> VAT) of the inverters tested are 1. 1 and 0. 84 Dollars per Watt output power for the 12 and 24 V inverter, showing a cost reduction of approximately a factor of two over the last 15 years.
