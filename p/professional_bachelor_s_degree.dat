40|$|This study {{examined}} the job changes of 680 early-career business school graduates. Although a number of anecdotal articles characterize MBAs as overly “careerist ” and oriented toward job-hopping, little empirical {{research has focused on}} this issue. The research included a direct comparison of job-hopping behavior of MBAs with <b>bachelor</b> <b>S</b> <b>degree</b> graduates, taking into account a number of control variables, including demographic and economic variables. Results indicated that MBAs changed jobs less frequently than bachelor 5 degree graduates, even when a variety of other factors were controlled. The proliferation of MBAs in managerial and professional jobs {{has been one of the}} most conspicuous trends in corporate America since the 1960 s. A commonly cited statistic is the 21, 000 MBA graduates in 1970 that grew to 63, 000 in 1983, to more than 70, 000 in 1990 (Jenkins, Reizenstein, & Rogers, 1984; Narisetti, 1991; Posner, 1987). Both MBA graduates and employing organizations portray the Master’s in Business Administration degree as a powerful ticket to success. The career advantages of the MBA degree for the employee are documented in a number of research studies (Dreher, Dougherty, & Whitely, 1985; Pfeffer, 1977). Among the advantages thought to accrue to firms that hire the MBA graduate are the obtaining of employees with a practical, “down-to-earth ” orientation (compared to liberal arts graduates), savings in initial training costs, and the hiring of new employees already socialized in managerial and corporate values (Gannon & Arlow, 1985). A steady stream of articles in popular business periodicals, however, casts doub...|$|R
40|$|Este estudo tratou dos impactos das recentes reformas nos currículos de Licenciatura e de Bacharelado em Educação Física na constituição de identidades dos profissionais de Educação Física. O objetivo central da pesquisa foi compreender de que maneira a reforma educacional foi apropriada e que efeitos resultaram nos currículos e na identidade profissional dos/as acadêmicos/as. Tomou-se como referência estudos pós-estruturalistas, especialmente os estudos foucaultianos no trato de conceitos como discurso, práticas discursivas e poder-saber. A utilização da Abordagem do Ciclo de Políticas de Stephen Ball permitiu que as análises empreendidas reposicionassem a visão sobre políticas educacionais e curriculares, compreendendo-as como resultado de constantes conflitos que ocorrem em diferentes contextos que se interpenetram, se relacionam, produzindo efeitos globais-locais. A investigação empreendida foi efetivada mediante a análise dos discursos: dos textos oficiais, relacionados às reformas educacionais para a formação de professores e de bacharéis em Educação Física; de docentes envolvidos com a produção do texto político na esfera federal; de docentes empenhados na recontextualização das normativas oficiais no contexto local de produção da política e de acadêmicos/as, formandos/as de 2010 da ESEF/UFPel. Defendi neste estudo que a instituição da Reforma Curricular do ano de 2004, Diretrizes Curriculares Nacionais para os curso de graduação em Educação Física (Resolução CNE/CES n. 07 / 2004) potencializou o discurso da distinção entre as formações, criando e consolidando possibilidades efetivas de pensar a formação e a constituição de identidades distintas, ainda assim, identidades perpassadas por práticas discursivas comuns que denotam a performatividade e o gerencialismo como tecnologias políticas no processo (auto) formativo; a força da tradição que se ajusta às normatizações oficiais sem abandonar antigas práticas pedagógicas que docentes da ESEF/UFPel consideram criativas para a formação dos profissionais de Educação Física; o mercado de trabalho como balizador e fim da formação profissional e a consolidação de estudos que perspectivam a Educação Física sob o viés biológico, sob o enfoque da atividade física, do desempenho e da saúde. This study {{dealt with}} the impact caused by the latest {{syllabus}} reform in the Physical Education course (both in the Teaching and the <b>Bachelor</b> <b>s</b> <b>Degrees)</b> on the constitution of Physical Educators identities. The main objective of the research was to understand whether these changes were appropriate and how they affected the syllabus and College students identities. Post-structuralist studies, mainly Foucauldian ones, were taken as references to work on concepts such as discourse, discursive practices and power-knowledge. The use of Stephen Ball s Policy Cycle Approach made the analyses address a view on educational and syllabus policies which could be understood {{as the result of}} constant conflicts in different contexts that interpenetrate and relate to each other to yield global-local effects. The investigation was carried out by discourse analyses of: official texts in educational reform that aims at students pursuing teaching and <b>bachelor</b> <b>s</b> <b>degrees</b> in Physical Education; the faculty involved {{in the development of a}} political text in the country; and the faculty who focused on the re-contextualization of official norms in the local context of political production and of seniors who graduated at ESEF/UFPel in 2010. In this study, I have defended that the Syllabus Reform which was carried out in 2004 in Physical Education courses (CNE/CES Resolution no. 07 / 2004) potentized the discourse of distinction between both degrees. Thus, effective possibilities of thinking about the development and the constitution of distinct identities were created and consolidated. Even so, these identities were embedded in common discursive practices which showed performativity and managerialism as political technologies in the (self) development process. Besides, I have pointed out the weight of tradition which fits official norms without abandoning old pedagogical practices that ESEF/UFPel professors consider creative and adequate to the development processes of professionals in Physical Education. Finally, the work market is seen as an indicator and the end of professional development as well as the consolidation of studies which look at Physical Education from a biological perspective in terms of physical activity, performance and health...|$|R
40|$|I {{study how}} {{education}} affects {{the allocation of}} talent into different sectors of the economy. I focus on two forces. First, education adds to a worker's information capital and, thus, may change her self-confidence. Second, performance contracts give a worker incentives to choose a sector according to her abilities. The baseline model predicts that workers with intermediate ability educate, while the most able skip education. In an extension, I compare the U.
