40|$|To support {{development}} of the Air Toxic Control Measure (ATCM) for stationary diesel engines, ARB staff worked with local air districts to develop a single statewide methodology and updated population and emission estimates for these engines.

Based on this methodology, ARB estimates that in the year 2002 there were approximately 21, 000 stationary diesel-fueled engines statewide. Backup generators was the most common stationary diesel equipment type (56 %), followed by backup <b>pumps</b> (37 %), <b>prime</b> generators (3 %), <b>prime</b> <b>pumps</b> (2 %), and others (1 %). Air compressors were found to be primarily portable and therefore were a negligible stationary source category, both in terms of population and emissions.

40|$|AbstractObjective: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether damage after deep hypothermic circulatory arrest can be diminished by changing <b>pump</b> <b>prime</b> components when reinstituting cardiopulmonary bypass. Methods: Fifteen piglets (2 - 3 months old) were cooled to 19 °C by using the alpha-stat pH strategy. Five were cooled and rewarmed without ischemia (control animals), and the other 10 piglets underwent 90 minutes of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Of these, 5 were rewarmed and reperfused without altering the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit blood prime. In the other 5 animals, the bypass blood prime was modified (leukocyte depleted, hypocalcemic, hypermagnesemic, pH-stat, normoxic, mannitol, and an Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor) during circulatory arrest before starting warm reperfusion. Oxidant injury was assessed {{on the basis of}} conjugated dienes, vascular changes on the basis of endothelin levels, myocardial function on the basis of cardiac output and dopamine need, lung injury on the basis of pulmonary vascular resistance and oxygenation, and cellular damage on the basis of release of creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase. Neurologic assessment (score 0, normal; score 500, brain death) was done 6 hours after discontinuing cardiopulmonary bypass. Results: Compared with animals undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass without ischemia (control animals), deep hypothermic circulatory arrest without modification of the reperfusate produced an oxidant injury (conjugated dienes increased 0. 78 vs 1. 71 absorbance (Abs) 240 nmol/L per 0. 5 mL, P <. 001 vs control animals), depressed cardiac output (6. 0 vs 4. 0 L/min, P <. 05 vs control subjects), prolonged dopamine need (P <. 001 vs control subjects), elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (74 % vs 197 %, P <. 05 vs control subjects), reduced oxygenation (P <. 01 vs control subjects), increased neurologic injury (56 vs 244, P <. 001 vs control subjects), and increased release of creatine kinase (2695 vs 6974 U/L, P <. 05 vs control subjects), aspartate aminotransferase (144 vs 229 U/L), and endothelin (1. 02 vs 2. 56 pg/mL, P <. 001 vs control subjects). Conversely, the oxidant injury was markedly limited (conjugated dienes of 0. 85 ± 0. 09 Abs 240 nmol/L per 0. 5 mL, P <. 001 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime)</b> with modification of cardiopulmonary bypass prime, resulting in increased cardiac output (5. 1 ± 0. 8 L/min), minimal dopamine need (P <. 001 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime),</b> no increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (44 % ± 31 %, P <. 01 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime)</b> or endothelin levels (0. 64 ± 0. 15 pg/mL, P <. 001 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime),</b> complete recovery of oxygenation (P <. 01 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime),</b> reduced neurologic damage (144 ± 33, P <. 05 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime),</b> and lower release of aspartate aminotransferase (124 ± 23 U/L, P <. 05 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime)</b> and creatine kinase (3366 ± 918, P <. 05 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime).</b> Conclusions: A global reperfusion injury after deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was identified and changed. The injury is mediated by oxygen-derived free radicals, resulting in organ and endothelial dysfunction. Modification of global organ and endothelial damage is achieved by modifying the blood prime in the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit to deliver a controlled global reperfusate when reinstituting bypass.

50|$|Typically, {{a liquid}} pump can't simply draw air. The feed {{line of the}} pump and the {{internal}} body surrounding the pumping mechanism must first be filled with the liquid that requires pumping: An operator must introduce liquid into the system to initiate the pumping.

30|$|Although {{commonly}} used in pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) optimal dose and timing of steroid administration is unclear.

30|$|The use of {{corticosteroids}} as a {{means of}} diminishing the inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has become a standard of practice in many institutions (Jonas 2004). Administration regimens vary since clear evidence of benefit or superiority of a particular timing remains elusive. However the administration of one dose of corticosteroid in <b>pump</b> <b>prime</b> is a standard of practice at many centres and is the preferred timing described in many studies (Hauser et al. 1998). In a survey of 36 international centres 97 % of respondents used steroids in some cases and of these 83 % used a single dose (Checcia et al. 2005). Since corticosteroids require approximately 2  hours for RNA transcription, and longer for maximal effects, administration in the <b>pump</b> <b>prime</b> may be too late to reduce the inflammatory response triggered by exposure to extracorporeal circulation (Ito et al. 1992; Xu et al. 1995).|$|R
