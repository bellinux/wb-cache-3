25|$|Cleanrooms {{maintain}} particulate-free {{air through}} the use of either HEPA or ULPA filters employing laminar or turbulent air flow principles. Laminar, or unidirectional, air flow systems direct filtered air downward or in horizontal direction in a constant stream towards filters located on walls near the cleanroom floor or through raised <b>perforated</b> <b>floor</b> panels to be recirculated. Laminar air flow systems are typically employed across 80% of a cleanroom ceiling to maintain constant air processing. Stainless steel or other non shedding materials are used to construct laminar air flow filters and hoods to prevent excess particles entering the air. Turbulent, or non unidirectional, air flow uses both laminar air flow hoods and nonspecific velocity filters to keep air in a cleanroom in constant motion, although not all in the same direction. The rough air seeks to trap particles that may be in the air and drive them towards the floor, where they enter filters and leave the cleanroom environment.

40|$|Abstract. Unidirectional airflow {{cleanroom}} {{was designed}} to ideally control the flow in order to overcome airborne contamination problems, and that design has not changed much {{over the past twenty}} years. However, in reality, it didn’t work as expected. Thus, airborne contamination problems in semiconductor and flat panel display industries still existed even if entire fabrication was processed in unidirectional cleanrooms. Eventually, flow-based re-evaluation of existing unidirectional cleanroom design became inevitable. In this study, we performed fluid dynamics simulations of unidirectional cleanroom at various dimensions, and interpreted the results for further steps of cleanroom designs, such as, inlet/outlet ducts, <b>perforated</b> <b>floors,</b> and equipment arrangement. Furthermore, we developed the mathematical model that interprets the airflow inclination at various cleanroom dimensions into a unified representation to provide designers with concepts for flow-based integration of cleanroom layout. The predicted angle/location of the maximum flow inclination by our mathematical model in terms of fundamental design parameters agreed well with the computational fluid dynamics simulation results and with the expected trends...|$|R

There is a drying floor under the bin roof and the drying fan and burner is installed high on the bin wall.

40|$|High {{mortality}} in rabbit rearing {{is not only}} an economical problem but also an animal welfare issue.  Without doubt, certain common rearing practices are the main reasons for the high mortality rates.  In this review, we point out different and commonly used management practices, which neither represent adequate housing conditions for the animals’ behavioural requirements nor correspond to their nutritional needs, and discuss possibilities {{to reduce the risk of}} disease. (1)  Usually the doe is forced to build the nursery nest in the cage or in a box with a permanently open entrance, often not protected from the light.  This can lead to perinatal mortality due to disturbed maternal behaviour, such as failure to build a proper nest, depositing the kits outside the nest, or infanticide. (2)  Continuous housing of the doe with the kits does not conform to this species’ pattern of unusually limited maternal care. Stimulated by olfactory and acoustic signals emanating from the nest, the doe disturbs the inactivity of the kits by her frequent entries to the nest or attempts to close the entrance. Cooling of the kits caused by maladaptive maternal behaviour under such unnatural conditions is one of the most important causes of mortality and morbidity during the nursing period. (3)  When the doe is left to nurse the kits for longer than four weeks, which does not conform to the reproductive biology of the rabbit, kit morbidity is caused by the following factors: (a) Prolonged mother-offspring contact increases the risk of the kits becoming infected with pathogens such as coccidiosis, EPEC and pasteurellosis persisting in the doe. (b) Pre-disposition of the kits to bacterial enteropathies is encouraged by the retarded development of the enzymatic system, delayed establishment of a stable gut flora (due to the use of wood shavings or straw as nest material) and by consumption of the doe’s feed. (c) The increased energy demands of lactation as well as mastitis due to excessive and prolonged suckling by the kits decrease the fertility and the lifespan of the doe. (4)   Feed with a high non-fibre carbohydrate content (compared to green forage) promotes bacterial enteropathies when given before the development of the kits’ digestive functions is completed.  In addition, the risk of the outbreak of such diseases is enhanced by intestinal coccidiosis and unstable gut flora.

40|$|Since its {{description}} by Dandy in 1922, several {{techniques have}} been used to perform third ventriculostomy under endoscopic control. Except for the blunt technique, in which the endoscope is used by itself to create the opening in the floor of the third ventricle, the other techniques require more than one instrument to <b>perforate</b> the <b>floor</b> of the ventricle and enlarge the ventriculostomy. The new device described is a sterilizable modified forceps that allows both the opening of the floor and the enlargement of the ventriculostomy in a simple and effective way. The new device has the following characteristics: 1) the tip of the forceps is thin enough to allow the easy perforation of the floor of the ventricle; 2) the inner surface of the jaws is smooth to avoid catching vessels of the basal cistern; and 3) the outer surface of the jaws has indentations that catch the edges of the opening to prevent them from slipping along the instrument's jaws. The ventricle floor is opened by gentle pressure of the forceps, which is slowly opened so that the edges of the aperture are caught by the distal outer indentation of the jaws, leading to an approximately 4 -mm opening of the floor.

40|$|Finding ways to {{conserve}} energy {{and reduce costs}} associated with growing crops {{continues to be a}} critical challenge for Ohio agriculture. Significant energy inputs must be supplied by the farmer to grow a crop. For example, the production of an average field of corn can require an estimated 8 million Btu of purchased energy per acre. An estimated 3 million of the fuel and electrical energy use may be required for conventional grain drying. According to survey results reported in 1996, nearly 80 percent of the shelled corn harvested in Ohio was dried on the farm. Twenty percent was dried commercially. Although natural air drying was only used by approximately 8 percent of the farmers who dried corn, it shows promise for both reduced energy input and improved grain quality when properly applied and managed. Defining Natural Air Drying Natural air drying is an in-bin drying system with the following typical characteristics: • Drying process is slow, generally requiring 4 to 8 weeks. • Initial moisture content is normally limited to 22 to 24 %. • Drying results from forcing unheated air through grain at airflow rates of 1 to 2 cfm/bu. • Drying and storage occur in the same bin, minimizing grain handling. • Bin is equipped with a full <b>perforated</b> <b>floor,</b> one or more high-capacity fans, a grain distributor, and stairs (se...|$|E

In this work, the substrate was composed of agricultural harvest and gardening waste from an area in the east of Spain. The biodrying process was carried out in a greenhouse, where both the heat generated in the fermentation and the heat of the sun were used.

40|$|Evolutionary {{and revolutionary}} {{advances}} in computational and storage systems have driven electronic circuit densities to unprecedented levels. These high-density systems must be adequately cooled for proper operation and long life expectancy. Cooling solutions must be designed and operated to minimize {{energy and environmental}} impacts. Executive decisions are {{deeply rooted in the}} technical aspects of the systems and solutions sought. These interdependent solutions seek to maximize system performance while minimizing capital and operating expenditures over the economic life of the data center. Traditional data centers employ a raised floor plenum structure to deliver cooling via <b>perforated</b> <b>floor</b> tiles as the primary delivery system for component cooling. Heated exhaust air exits the equipment and travels upward to warm return plenum structures for subsequent capture and re-cooling. This floor-to-ceiling airflow behavior represents a vertical airflow-cooling paradigm. The resulting airflow may travel 150 feet or more per cooling cycle. A new class of data center cooling utilizes a technique called 'in-row' cooling. This new technique does not require a raised floor plenum, perforated tiles, nor return plenum structures. The airflow travels horizontally from rack-to-rack with respect to cold air delivery and warm air return. Airflow travel is subsequently reduced to only 10 feet per cooling cycle. This thesis will explore the economic benefits and economies of this new airflow paradigm against traditional data centers through the use of measurement and Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modeling software. by Albert O.

It is found that variation of diffuser suction to the plenum chambers behind the perforated walls has a significant effect on the damping derivatives. With the half-model technique used, both lift and pitching-moment derivatives are shown to be influenced by the thickness of the side-wall boundary layer, but in many practical cases the effect may be acceptably small...|$|R
