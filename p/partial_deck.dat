50|$|The Sagamo was {{designed}} with two full decks above the hull, and two additional <b>partial</b> <b>decks</b> above those. On the main deck was the galley and {{the dining room}} which seated 90 people, and the washrooms. The promenade deck above had forward and aft lounges. On the third deck was a smoking lounge. The ship could hold 800 passengers with luggage along with a crew of 26.|$|R
50|$|A {{double-deck}} aircraft has two decks for passengers; {{the second}} deck {{may be only}} a <b>partial</b> <b>deck,</b> and may be above or below the main deck. Most commercial aircraft have one passenger deck and one cargo deck for luggage and ULD containers, {{but only a few}} have two decks for passengers, typically above a third deck for cargo.|$|E
50|$|A typical group's {{conventions}} for deck creation follow:Though {{cards are}} created {{at all times}} throughout the game (except the epilogue), {{it is necessary to}} start with at least some cards pre-made. Depending on the desired duration of the game a deck of 80 to 150 cards is usual, and of these approximately half will be created before the start of play. If a group doesn't already possess a <b>partial</b> <b>deck</b> they may choose to start with fewer cards and to create most of the deck during play.|$|E

25|$|G Deck, the Lower Deck, was {{the lowest}} {{complete}} deck that carried passengers, and had the lowest portholes, just above the waterline. The squash court was located here along with the traveling post office where letters and parcels were sorted ready for delivery when the ship docked. Food was also stored here.

5000|$|On 18 August 1944 Daronia {{left the}} Port of Durban, Union of South Africa, in ballast {{and with a}} <b>partial</b> <b>deck</b> cargo of empty oil drums and general cargo. She was part of Convoy DN-68, sailing northwards in the Indian Ocean for {{dispersal}} further up the coast of East Africa. At 1941 hrs on 20 August Daronia was between South Africa and Madagascar at a position of [...] when the Kriegsmarine Type IXD U-boat [...] commanded by Korvettenkapitän Jürgen Oesten hit her with two torpedoes. These did not sink Daronia and Captain Ritchie returned her safely to Durban, where she arrived on 26 August and remained {{for the remainder of}} World War II. [...] After the war she was repaired and in February 1946 she was returned to service.|$|E
40|$|Wide flange precast/prestressed {{concrete}} I-girders {{have been}} widely used by several State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) in the last two decades. These girders have many advantages over standard AASHTO I-girders. Their wide and thick bottom flange accommodates a large number of prestressing strands and their wide and thin top flange provides a shorter deck span, reduced girder weight, greater stability in construction, and adequate platform for workers. Despite these advantages, the wide and thin top flange might be disadvantageous when it comes to deck removal, as it is more susceptible to damage. Therefore {{there is a need to}} investigate the impact of deck removal methods on the performance of the supporting wide flange I-girder. In this thesis, two deck removal methods are presented: saw cutting and jack hammering. The two methods were implemented on the Camp Creek Bridge over I- 80 in Lancaster County, NE before demolition due to its functional obsolesces. Different saw cutting and jack hammering techniques were performed for deck removal between girders and on top of girders. Data obtained from using similar techniques on three other projects were collected and analyzed. Two girders from the Camp Creek Bridge were taken to the lab for testing in flexure after applying different levels of deck removals around shear connectors and re-decking. Test results indicated adequate performance of the new composite section even when <b>partial</b> <b>deck</b> removal around shear connectors is applied. Another investigation was conducted to evaluate the effect of top flange width on the performance of bridge I-girders. Top flange was assumed to be longitudinally saw cut and its width is reduced by fifty percent. The effects on geometrical properties, flexural capacity, horizontal shear capacity, and deflection were investigated analytically and experimentally under construction loads and service loads. Investigation results indicate that in some cases top flange width does not have significant impact on the structural performance of I-girders. Adviser: George Morcou...|$|E

5000|$|A {{certain number}} of the faces of playing cards are not symmetrical, and {{therefore}} {{can also be used}} as [...] "pointer cards" [...] (the seven of any suit, for instance, whose odd pip is off-center on most modern decks).

25|$|The new stadium--roughly {{corresponding}} to {{the lower half of}} the current structure's east and west grandstands--opened later that year. By 1929, the stadium had become a 32,890-seat horseshoe, with temporary seating for an additional 5,000. The space inside the horseshoe was sufficient to allow a track surrounding the field. Capacity was raised to 41,500 in 1953 when a <b>partial</b> second <b>deck</b> and a pressbox were added at a cost of $346,000.|$|R
50|$|E. R. Moon was {{the first}} captain. In 1917 a young native and former slave, John Inkima, started work on the S. S. Oregon; he became captain in 1920 and stayed for almost 30 years. The ship was remodeled in 1935 and a <b>partial</b> third <b>deck</b> added. The {{steamship}} continued to serve the missions until it was sold in 1950. The bell from the S. S. Oregon is now housed at the Disciples of Christ Historical Society in Nashville, Tennessee.|$|R
2500|$|The vessels had two {{complete}} decks, {{upper and}} lower, with <b>partial</b> <b>decks</b> at the forecastle and poop. [...] The forecastle {{was used for}} the heads and working space for the cables. [...] The poop deck contained cabins for the captain, first lieutenant, and navigating officer, with the double wheel sheltered under its forward end. [...] Between these was the open quarterdeck on which the battery was located. [...] Under the lower deck were spaces for water, provisions, coal, and magazines for shell and powder. [...] Amidships were the engine and boiler rooms. [...] These were covered by an armoured deck, 1.5inches (38mm) thick and approximately 100ft (30m) long. This armour was about 3ft (90cm) below the lower deck, and the space between could be used for additional coal bunkerage. The machinery spaces were flanked by coal bunkers, affording the machinery and magazines some protection from the sides. [...] The lower deck was used for berthing of the ship's company; officers aft, warrant and petty officers forward, and ratings amidships, as was traditional. [...] The tops of the coal bunkers, which projected above deck level, were used for seating at the mess tables. [...] The living spaces were well-ventilated and an improvement over prior vessels.|$|R
50|$|She {{sported a}} <b>partial</b> turtle <b>deck</b> forward and shorter funnels than later ships of this type. She was {{designed}} {{to act as a}} leader of a destroyer flotilla but like other ships of this type was soon proved to be too slow for the role. As turbine engined destroyers came into service, they were rendered obsolete. She was armed with ten 12-pounder (76-mm) quick firing guns, eight 3-pounder (47-mm) quick firing guns and two 18-inch (460-mm) torpedo tubes. In 1911-12 she was rearmed with nine QF 4-inch (101.6-mm) Mk IV guns.|$|R
5000|$|The {{new stadium}} opened later that year. In 1929, grandstands were added {{on the north}} and west ends, turning the {{facility}} into a 33,000-seat horseshoe. The space inside the horseshoe was sufficient to allow a track surrounding the field. Capacity was raised to 41,500 in 1953 when a <b>partial</b> second <b>deck</b> and a pressbox were added at a cost of $346,000. More of second deck and other improvements were added in 1967 to raise the capacity to 48,000 at a cost of $1,840,000. [...] In 1974, two large flagpoles were added {{at the south end of}} the stadium in memory of Lt. William B. Blocker, Texas A&M class of 1945.|$|R
