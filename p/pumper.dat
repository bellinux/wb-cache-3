5|$|In 2015, the {{department}} retired and traded in its 1999 ambulance when purchasing its 2016 replacement. The following year, {{the department}} retired its 1991 <b>pumper</b> and a mass casualty decontamination unit trailer acquired through a Federal Emergency Management Agency grant, donating {{the latter to}} the New York Guard.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the {{department}} ordered a rescue truck for $194,448 ($ today) from 3-D Manufacturing, and a Pierce <b>pumper</b> truck was purchased at $312,777 ($ today) for Scarborough to replace their corroding 1974 Mack truck. A year later, {{the department}} hosted the Westchester County Volunteer Firemen Association Convention, the usual parade with 43 departments, a golf outing, {{and the annual}} meeting and dinner of the Association. During the September 11 attacks in 2001, the department sent some of its engines to the Bronx to cover for units that had left for the World Trade Center.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} apparatus {{was only}} suitable for small fires, and was supplemented in 1902 with a steam-operated <b>pumper</b> and a hose wagon, both horse-drawn. The {{two pieces of}} equipment were purchased by Walter Law's Briarcliff Realty Company and were loaned to the fire company without charge. At the time, the fire company housed its equipment and horses at the Briarcliff Farms' Barn A (present-day St. Theresa's School) and used the Wheelwright shop as a meeting room and for social events.|$|E

50|$|Between 1929 and 1932, {{the shop}} built eight large <b>pumpers</b> because the {{existing}} Pierce Arrow touring car chassis, the usual platform for fire equipment at the time, had insufficient capacity. Representatives of the Minneapolis Fire Department visited the Milwaukee Fire Department {{to learn how}} they were building their own new <b>pumpers.</b> The Minneapolis shop then started building its new <b>pumpers</b> using components from the Four Wheel Drive company. Four Wheel Drive built the engines, drivetrains, suspension components, and other components, while the Minneapolis Fire Department shops provided the frames, bodywork, pumping equipment, and all other firefighting equipment. The Minneapolis Fire Department also completed the assembly of these vehicles. Although the <b>pumpers</b> had an ungainly appearance and were hard to steer, some of these <b>pumpers</b> remained in active service until 1955.|$|R
5|$|One episode {{includes}} a flashback to San Carlos de Bariloche, {{the location of}} the graduation trip (an Argentine prom tradition). Pablo Echarri made a guest appearance as the trip's coordinator, and fans of the show were selected in an internet competition to join the trip to Bariloche as extras. Another flashback features the <b>Pumper</b> Nic fast-food restaurant and a guest appearance by sportswriter Juan Pablo Varsky. Not all flashbacks are focused on the 1980s or high school; some are events from a character's adolescence, such as the shotgun wedding of María Laura and Pablo or her 15th birthday.|$|E
5|$|In his eighties, Nielsen {{performed}} serious roles {{on screen}} and stage (such as his one-man theatre show Darrow, {{in which he}} played Clarence Darrow), {{as well as providing}} voice-overs and appearances for commercials; cartoons like Zeroman where he had the leading role/voice; children's shows, such as <b>Pumper</b> Pups, which he narrated, in addition to comedic film roles. The sibling relationship with his elder brother, the Honourable Erik Nielsen, a former Deputy Prime Minister of Canada, served as the premise of an HBO mockumentary entitled The Canadian Conspiracy in which Leslie Nielsen appeared, along with other prominent Canadian-born media personalities. He was a celebrity contestant on CBS's Gameshow Marathon, where he played The Price Is Right, Let's Make a Deal, Beat the Clock, and Press Your Luck for charity.|$|E
5|$|After a large fire at Miss Knox's School (site of the Briarcliff Corporate Campus) in 1912, the department's {{equipment}} was upgraded {{to deal with}} larger fires. The village purchased its first motorized vehicle, an American LaFrance <b>pumper</b> truck. The existing hose-and-chemical wagon was motorized and became the chief's car. In 1914, the Briarcliff Manor Municipal Building was constructed to house the government and fire engines. The likeness of its garage doors {{can be seen in}} the façade of the present restaurant. Later in 1914 the department established sub-stations at Mrs. Whitson's barn on Pleasantville Road and on the Holden farm at Scarborough Road (roughly opposite the current firehouse); these were discontinued in 1921. The first major fire to involve the motorized vehicles was in 1916 at the central business district. In spite of the new equipment, several buildings at the northern end were destroyed. The 1908 hook-and-ladder truck was motorized in 1923 and two years later, the chief's car was replaced by another American LaFrance vehicle. An electric siren was installed in 1928 after a complaint that the previous alarm sounded more like a call to breakfast than an alarm of fire.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pumpers</b> are {{equipped}} with a large pump capable of pumping thousands of litres of water per minute, some up to 4000 litres per minute. <b>Pumpers</b> are generally used in an urban environment to fight structure fires, as they require a reticulated or static water supply (e.g.: a dam) to operate.|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 1900s, the Archville Fire Company was formed in {{neighboring}} Archville, New York, with the company headquarters in a shed on the corner of Albany Post Road (current U.S. Route 9) and Union Street. The company's original equipment consisted of thirty 3½ gallon galvanized buckets, and later a 50-gallon horse-drawn <b>pumper</b> purchased from the Valhalla Fire Department. The company was chartered in 1909 as the Archville Fire Department, with Hubert W. Mannerly as the first fire chief. From then until 1930 the Archville department was autonomous, until Briarcliff Manor requested that Archville provide its fire protection services to Scarborough. In 1930, the Archville department changed its name to the Scarborough Fire Company and became part of the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department, although no contract had been signed and neither party expressed intentions to formalize the arrangement. In 1972, the company was split into two units, with an autonomous Archville unit and the Scarborough Engine Company, headquartered in the Scarborough Presbyterian Church garage and a part of the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} initial tornado dissipated, a new {{circulation}} rapidly developed {{to the east of}} the old one. This new circulation produced a tornado that touched down at the Union University campus in Jackson, almost immediately intensifying into a violent EF4 and causing tremendous damage. Several large, brick, two-story dormitory buildings sustained major structural damage, two of which completely collapsed. 80% of the dormitory buildings on campus were damaged or destroyed, and hundreds of vehicles were damaged or destroyed in the parking lots around campus. Twelve students at the university were trapped in damaged buildings but all were eventually rescued. Due to the damage, the university was closed until February 18. Past Union University, the tornado weakened slightly and maintained EF3 strength along the remainder of the path. It tracked across U.S. Route 45, heavily damaging several banks, businesses, a hospital, and several doctors offices. The tornado then moved through the northern part of Jackson, inflicting significant damage to many subdivisions and businesses. The Chapel Creek, Indian Hills, and Wyndhurst subdivisions were all struck by the tornado. Numerous homes were damaged in this area, some of which sustained loss of roofs and exterior walls. Additional damage was noted at Northside High School, at the Jackson Oaks Senior Living Complex, and in the Walnut Trace subdivision as well. Continuing northeast, the tornado caused major damage to multiple additional homes as it crossed near the intersection of Christmasville Road and Ashport Road. The Madison County Fire Station #11 was destroyed in this area as well, with the station's fire engine and <b>pumper,</b> along with its water and brush trucks all being damaged. Beyond this point, the tornado weakened and dissipated. 70 structures were destroyed in Jackson, with over 500 more damaged. Despite causing EF4 damage after dark in a densely populated area, the tornado did not cause any deaths in Jackson, though 51 people were injured, and the initial EF3 tornado caused three fatalities and 14 injuries. The second of the two tornadoes was the third violent tornado to hit Jackson in 10 years. Two others, both rated F4, had devastated the community on January 17, 1999 and May 4, 2003.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the mid-19th}} century, most fire engines were maneuvered by men, but the {{introduction}} of horse-drawn fire engines considerably improved the response time to incidents. The first self-propelled steam <b>pumper</b> fire engine was built in New York in 1841. Unfortunately for the manufacturers, some firefighters sabotaged the device and its use of the first engine was discontinued. However, the need and the utility of power equipment ensured {{the success of the}} steam <b>pumper</b> well into the twentieth century. Many cities and towns around the world bought the steam fire engines.|$|E

50|$|Until {{the mid-19th}} century, most fires were fought by water {{transported to the}} scene in buckets. Original hand <b>pumpers</b> {{discharged}} their water through a small pipe or monitor attached {{to the top of}} the pump tub. It was not until the late 1860s that hoses became widely available to convey water more easily from the hand pumps, and later steam <b>pumpers,</b> to the fire.|$|R

25|$|These are trucks {{which are}} {{designed}} for one purpose, like Rescue, or HAZMAT. Usually these are combined with another truck. (e.g. A <b>pumper</b> will be a combined Pumper/HAZMAT truck, or Pumper/Rescue) There is one statewide HAZMAT truck, which is based at Burnside CFS that responds to any HAZMAT incident in the state. It carries extra air cylinders for the Breathing Apparatus as well as gas tight suits, atmospheric monitoring equipment, and other specialised equipment.|$|E
