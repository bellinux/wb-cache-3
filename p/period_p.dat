25|$|The {{incoming}} beam {{is shaped}} by slits of a few tens of micrometers such that the transverse coherence length {{is greater than the}} grating period. The interferometer consists of three parallel and equally spaced phase gratings, and an x-ray camera. The incident beam is diffracted by a first grating of period 2P into two beams. These are further diffracted by a second grating of <b>period</b> <b>P</b> into four beams. Two of the four merge at a third grating of period 2P. Each is further diffracted by the third grating. The multiple diffracted beams are allowed to propagate for sufficient distance such that the different diffraction orders are separated at the camera. There exists a pair of diffracted beams that co-propagate from the third grating to the camera. They interfere with each other to produce intensity fringes if the gratings are slightly misaligned with each other. The central pair of diffraction paths are always equal in length regardless of the x-ray energy or the angle of the incident beam. The interference patterns from different photon energes and incident angles are locked in phase.|$|E

50|$|Here {{we present}} {{patterns}} with inclined lines. When {{we are interested}} in optical speedup we can represent the case of inclined patterns such that the formulas for computing moiré periods and optical speedups remain valid in their current simplest form. For this purpose, the values of periods pr, pb, and pm correspond to the distances between the lines along the axis of movements (the vertical axis in the animated example of Figure 4). When the layer lines are perpendicular to the movement axis, the <b>periods</b> (<b>p)</b> are equal to the distances (denoted as T) between the lines (as in Figure 4). If the lines are inclined, the <b>periods</b> (<b>p)</b> along the axis of the movement are not equal to the distances (T) between the lines.|$|R

However, large scale awareness really took off when the dime novel appeared in 1859, the first being Malaeska, the Indian Wife of the White Hunter. By simplifying reality and grossly exaggerating the truth, the novels captured the public's attention with sensational tales of violence and heroism, and fixed in the public's mind stereotypical images of heroes and villains—courageous cowboys and savage Indians, virtuous lawmen and ruthless outlaws, brave settlers and predatory cattlemen. Millions of copies and thousands of titles were sold. The novels relied {{on a series of}} predictable literary formulas appealing to mass tastes and were often written in as little as a few days.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Our {{objective}} was to evaluate the feasibility, the quality of synchronization, and the influence on respiratory parameters of the noninvasive neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NIV-NAVA) mode in infants after cardiac bypass surgery. We conducted a prospective, randomized cross-over study in infants undergoing noninvasive ventilation (NIV) after cardiac surgery. METHODS: Subjects were 10 infants < 5 kg. After extubation, subjects underwent 2 consecutive ventilatory modes after randomization into groups. In the CPAP first group, the subjects were ventilated first in nasal CPAP- 1 and then in NIV-NAVA- 2 for 30 min in each mode. In the NIV-NAVA first group, periods were reversed. All children were ventilated using the same inter- face. RESULTS: The analysis of curves showed a synchronization rate of 99. 3 % for all respiratory cycles. The rate of pneumatic inspiratory trigger was 3. 4 %. Asynchronies were infrequent. Some typical respiratory patterns (continuous effort and discontinuous inspiration) were found at rates of 10. 9 % and 31. 1 %, respectively. The respiratory trends showed a lower maximum diaphragmatic electrical activity (EAdi(max)) in NIV-NAVA periods compared with CPAP <b>periods</b> (<b>P</b> <. 001 {{in the beginning of}} periods). The breathing frequency decreased significantly during the nasal CPAP- 2 and NIV-NAVA- 1 <b>periods</b> (<b>P</b> <. 05). The inspiratory pressure increased significantly during the NIV-NAVA- 1 and NIV-NAVA- 2 <b>periods</b> (<b>P</b> <. 05), but {{there was no significant difference}} for each parameter when comparing values between the beginning and the end of each period. The EAdi signal was easy to obtain in all subjects, and no major side effects were associated with the use of NIV-NAVA. CONCLUSIONS: NIV-NAVA allows good synchronization in bi-level NIV in infant cardiac subjects weighing < 5 kg. The analysis of respiratory parameters shows that NIV NAVA decreases the work of breathing more effectively than nasal CPAP. The study shows some typical respiratory patterns in infants...|$|R
