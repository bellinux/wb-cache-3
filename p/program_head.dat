500|$|Key {{avionics}} include BAE Systems EI AN/ALR-94 radar warning receiver (RWR), Lockheed Martin AN/AAR-56 infrared and ultraviolet Missile Launch Detector (MLD) and Northrop Grumman AN/APG-77 {{active electronically scanned array}} (AESA) radar. The MLD features six {{sensors to}} provide full spherical infrared coverage. The RWR is a passive radar detector {{with more than}} 30 antennas blended into the wings and fuselage for all-round coverage. Tom Burbage, former F-22 <b>program</b> <b>head</b> at Lockheed Martin, described it as [...] "the most technically complex piece of equipment on the aircraft." [...] The range of the RWR (250+ nmi) exceeds the radar's, and can cue radar emissions to be confined to a narrow beam (down to 2° by 2° in azimuth and elevation) to increase stealth. Depending on the detected threat, the defensive systems can prompt the pilot to release countermeasures such as flares or chaff. According to Bill Sweetman, experts had said the ALR-94 {{can be used as a}} passive detection system capable of searching targets and providing enough information for a radar lock on.|$|E
