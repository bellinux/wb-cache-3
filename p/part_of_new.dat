5|$|Chester Alan Arthur (October5, 1829– November18, 1886) was an American {{attorney}} and politician {{who served as}} the 21st President of the United States from 1881 to 1885; he succeeded James A.

At the outset, Arthur struggled to overcome a slightly negative reputation, which stemmed from his early career in politics as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York's Republican political machine. He succeeded by embracing the cause of civil service reform. His advocacy for, and subsequent enforcement of, the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act was the centerpiece of his administration.|$|E

After restrengthening to tropical storm-force winds, the remnants of Bob turned towards the southeast and slowed.

5|$|NY373 exists entirely {{within the}} {{boundaries}} of Adirondack Park, a protected area maintained by the State of New York. Adirondack Park was created in the 1880s after concerns arose about logging trees in the area. The logging was a substantial <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York's economy, but protests were lodged by The New York Times and others against the clearing of entire mountains and wilderness areas of trees. Public opinion turned firmly against the loggers by the 1880s, and the park was created in 1885. It was the first State Forest Preserve in America. The park was further protected in 1894 when a clause was added to the New York State constitution which banned the selling of timber from state parks.|$|E
