5|$|In Western Europe, some of {{the older}} Roman elite {{families}} died out while others became more involved with ecclesiastical than secular affairs. Values attached to Latin scholarship and education mostly disappeared, and while literacy remained important, it became a <b>practical</b> <b>skill</b> rather than a sign of elite status. In the 4th century, Jerome (d. 420) dreamed that God rebuked him for spending more time reading Cicero than the Bible. By the 6th century, Gregory of Tours (d. 594) had a similar dream, but instead of being chastised for reading Cicero, he was chastised for learning shorthand. By the late 6th century, the principal means of religious instruction in the Church had become music and art rather than the book. Most intellectual efforts went towards imitating classical scholarship, but some original works were created, along with now-lost oral compositions. The writings of Sidonius Apollinaris (d. 489), Cassiodorus (d. c. 585), and Boethius (d. c. 525) were typical of the age.|$|E

25|$|Some Xing Yi {{practitioners}} {{also use}} the five elements as an interpretative framework for reacting and responding to attacks. This follows the five element theory, a general combat formula which assumes two types of cyclic interactions and three types of adverse interactions. The two cyclic interactions are the mutual nourishment (constructive) and mutual restraint (destructive) cycles. The adverse reactions are lesser known and rarely trained but exist from the understanding that nothing would exist if the mutual nourishment and restraint cycles existed alone, the adverse reactions are mutual over-restraint (overwhelming destructive interation), mutual reverse restraint (reversal of the destructive cycle), and mutual burdening (unbalancing or reversal of the constructive cycle). Practitioners abiding by these concepts train to react to and execute specific techniques {{in such a way}} that a desirable cycle will form based on these interactions of the five element theory. Where to aim, where to hit and with what technique—and how those motions should work defensively, is determined by what point of which cycle they see themselves in. Each of the elements has many variant applications that allow it to be used to defend against all of the elements (including itself), so any set sequences are ultimately entirely arbitrary in real combat but present a frame work for developing a more <b>practical</b> <b>skill,</b> the destructive cycle is often taught to 'beginners' as it is generally easier to visualize and consists of easier applications.|$|E

The acquisition of both technical and <b>practical</b> <b>skills</b> not only is the outcome of education, but also is required by a market economy.

However, the data also revealed three barriers to this process: (1) the traditional exam-oriented educational philosophy in China; (2) only schools are responsible for providing education; and (3) financial issues.

6000|$|So, again, with {{skill in}} farming and agriculture. From whom does that come? The very heathens {{can tell us}} that, for it is curious, that among the heathen, in all ages and countries, those men who have found out great {{improvements}} in tilling the ground have been honoured and often worshipped as divine men--as gods, thereby shewing that the heathen, among all their idolatries, had a true and just notion about man's <b>practical</b> <b>skill</b> and knowledge--that it could only come from Heaven, that it was by the inspiration and guidance of God above that skill in agriculture arose. What says Isaiah of that to the very same purpose? [...] "Doth the ploughman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his ground? When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the vetches, and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rye in their place?

Agriculture has been cultivated from the earliest times, and, from a remote antiquity, men have attained considerable <b>practical</b> <b>skill</b> in the cultivation of the useful plants, and have empirically established many scientific truths concerning {{the conditions under which}} they flourish. But, it is within the memory of many of us, that chemistry on the one hand, and vegetable physiology on the other, attained a stage of development such {{that they were able to}} furnish a sound basis for scientific agriculture. Similarly, medicine took its rise in the practical needs of mankind. At first, studied without reference to any other branch of knowledge, it long maintained, indeed still to some extent maintains, that independence. Historically, its connection with the biological sciences has been slowly established, and the full extent and intimacy of that connection are only now beginning to be apparent. I trust I have not been mistaken in supposing that an attempt to give a brief sketch of the steps by which a philosophical necessity has become an historical reality, may not be devoid of interest, possibly of instruction, to the members of this great Congress, profoundly interested as all are in the scientific development of medicine.|$|E
