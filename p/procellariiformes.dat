5|$|According to {{the famous}} DNA {{hybridization}} study into avian phylogenetic relationships by Sibley and Ahlquist, the split of the <b>Procellariiformes</b> into the four families occurred around 30 million years ago; a fossil bone often attributed to the order, described as the genus Tytthostonyx, {{has been found in}} rocks dating around the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (70-60 mya), but the remains are too incomplete for placement within the <b>Procellariiformes</b> to be certain.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses, {{along with}} all <b>Procellariiformes,</b> must excrete the salts they ingest in {{drinking}} sea water and eating marine invertebrates. All birds have an enlarged nasal gland {{at the base of}} the bill, above their eyes. This gland is inactive in species that do not require it, but in the <b>Procellariiformes</b> it acts as a salt gland. Scientists are uncertain as to its exact processes, but do know in general terms that it removes salt by secreting a 5% saline solution that drips out of their nose or is forcibly ejected.|$|E
5|$|Sibley and Ahlquist's {{taxonomy}} {{has included}} {{all the members}} of the <b>Procellariiformes</b> inside the Procellariidae and that family in an enlarged Ciconiiformes, but this change has not been widely accepted.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the albatross {{group has been}} a source of much debate. The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy places seabirds, birds of prey and many others in a greatly enlarged order, Ciconiiformes, whereas the ornithological organisations in North America, Europe, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand retain the more traditional order <b>Procellariiformes.</b> The albatrosses can be separated from the other <b>Procellariiformes</b> both genetically and through morphological characteristics, size, their legs, and the arrangement of their nasal tubes (see below: Morphology and flight).|$|E
5|$|A few {{species are}} able to use {{chemical}} defences against predators; some <b>Procellariiformes</b> can eject an unpleasant stomach oil against an aggressor, and some species of pitohuis from New Guinea have a powerful neurotoxin in their skin and feathers.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the procellariids is {{the most}} diverse of all the <b>Procellariiformes,</b> as are the methods {{employed}} to obtain it. With {{the exception of the}} giant petrels, all procellariids are exclusively marine, and the diet of all species is dominated by either fish, squid, crustaceans and carrion, or some combination thereof.|$|E
5|$|The family Procellariidae is a {{group of}} seabirds that {{comprises}} the fulmarine petrels, the gadfly petrels, the prions, and the shearwaters. This family is part of the bird order <b>Procellariiformes</b> (or tubenoses), which also includes the albatrosses, the storm petrels, and the diving petrels.|$|E
5|$|The fulmarine petrels are generalists, {{which for}} the most part take many species of fish and crustacea. The giant petrels, uniquely for <b>Procellariiformes,</b> will feed on land, eating the carrion of other seabirds and seals. They will also attack the chicks of other seabirds. The diet of the giant petrels varies {{according}} to sex, with the females taking more krill and the males more carrion. All the fulmarine petrels readily feed on fisheries discards at sea, a habit that has been implicated in (but not proved to have caused) the expansion in range of the northern fulmar in the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|The procellariids are small- to {{medium-sized}} seabirds. The largest, {{the giant}} petrels with a wingspan of , {{are almost as}} large as albatrosses; the smallest, such as the fairy prion have a wingspan of , are slightly bigger than the diving petrels. There are no obvious differences between the sexes, although females tend to be slighter. Like all <b>Procellariiformes,</b> the procellariids have a characteristic tubular nasal passage used for olfaction. This ability to smell helps to locate patchily distributed prey at sea and may also help locate nesting colonies. The plumage of the procellariids is usually dull, with greys, blues, blacks and browns being the usual colours, although some species have striking patterns (such as the Cape petrel).|$|E
5|$|Seabirds {{have made}} {{numerous}} adaptations to living on and feeding in the sea. Wing morphology {{has been shaped}} by the niche an individual species or family has evolved, so that looking at a wing's shape and loading can tell a scientist about its life feeding behaviour. Longer wings and low wing loading are typical of more pelagic species, while diving species have shorter wings. Species such as the wandering albatross, which forage over huge areas of sea, have a reduced capacity for powered flight and are dependent on a type of gliding called dynamic soaring (where the wind deflected by waves provides lift) as well as slope soaring. Seabirds also almost always have webbed feet, to aid movement on the surface as well as assisting diving in some species. The <b>Procellariiformes</b> are unusual among birds in having {{a strong sense of}} smell, which is used to find widely distributed food in a vast ocean, and possibly to locate their colonies.|$|E
5|$|Two subfamilies, Hydrobatinae and Oceanitinae, were {{recognized}} in the past within a single large family Hydrobatidae but this has since been split with the elevation of Oceanitidae to family status. The Oceanitinae, or austral storm petrels, were mostly found in southern waters (though Wilson's storm petrel regularly migrates into the northern hemisphere); there were seven species in five genera. The Hydrobatinae, or northern storm petrels, were the two genera Hydrobates and Oceanodroma. They were largely restricted to the northern hemisphere, although a few visit or breed a short distance south of the equator. Cytochrome b DNA sequence analysis suggested that the family was paraphyletic and more accurately treated as two distinct families. The same {{study found that the}} austral storm petrels are basal within <b>Procellariiformes.</b> The first split was the family Oceanitidae, with the Hydrobatidae splitting {{from the rest of the}} order at a later date. A few fossil species have been found, with the earliest being from the Upper Miocene.|$|E
5|$|While Hesperornis is {{not thought}} to have left descendants, the {{earliest}} modern seabirds also occurred in the Cretaceous, with a species called Tytthostonyx glauconiticus, which seems allied to the <b>Procellariiformes</b> and Pelecaniformes. In the Paleogene the seas were dominated by early Procellariidae, giant penguins and two extinct families, the Pelagornithidae and the Plotopteridae (a group of large seabirds that looked like the penguins). Modern genera began their wide radiation in the Miocene, although the genus Puffinus (which includes today's Manx shearwater and sooty shearwater) might {{date back to the}} Oligocene. The highest diversity of seabirds apparently existed during the Late Miocene and the Pliocene. At the end of the latter, the oceanic food web had undergone a period of upheaval due to extinction of considerable numbers of marine species; subsequently, the spread of marine mammals seems to have prevented seabirds from reaching their erstwhile diversity.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids display {{high levels}} of philopatry, exhibiting both natal philopatry and site fidelity. Natal philopatry, the {{tendency}} of a bird to breed close to where it hatched, is strong among all the <b>Procellariiformes.</b> The evidence for natal philopatry comes from several sources, {{not the least of}} which is the existence of several procellariid species that are endemic to a single island. The study of mitochondrial DNA also provides evidence of restricted gene flow between different colonies, and has been used to show philopatry in fairy prions. Bird ringing also provides compelling evidence of philopatry; a study of Cory's shearwaters nesting near Corsica found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony actually bred in the burrow they were raised in. This tendency towards philopatry is stronger in some species than others, and several species readily prospect potential new colony sites and colonise them. It is hypothesised that there is a cost to dispersing to a new site, the chance of not finding a mate of the same species, that selects against it for rarer species, whereas there is probably an advantage to dispersal for species that have colony sites that change dramatically during periods of glacial advance or retreat. There are also differences in the tendency to disperse based on sex, with females being more likely to breed away from the natal site.|$|E
5|$|Sibley and Ahlquist's {{molecular}} {{study of}} the evolution of the bird families has put the radiation of the <b>Procellariiformes</b> in the Oligocene period (35–30 million years ago), though this group probably originated earlier, with a fossil sometimes attributed to the order, a seabird known as Tytthostonyx, being found in late Cretaceous rocks (70 mya). The molecular evidence suggests that the storm petrels were the first to diverge from the ancestral stock, and the albatrosses next, with the procellarids and diving petrels separating later. The earliest fossil albatrosses were found in Eocene to Oligocene rocks, although some of these are only tentatively assigned to the family and none appear to be particularly close to the living forms. They are Murunkus (Middle Eocene of Uzbekistan), Manu (early Oligocene of New Zealand), and an undescribed form from the Late Oligocene of South Carolina. Similar to the last was Plotornis, formerly often considered a petrel but now accepted as an albatross. It is from the Middle Miocene of France, a time when the split between the four modern genera was already underway as evidenced by Phoebastria californica and Diomedea milleri, both being mid-Miocene species from Sharktooth Hill, California. These show that the split between the great albatrosses and the North Pacific albatrosses occurred by 15 mya. Similar fossil finds in the Southern Hemisphere put the split between the sooties and mollymawks at 10 mya.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids {{begin to}} attend their nesting colony around one month prior to laying. Males will arrive first and attend the colony more {{frequently}} than females, partly {{in order to protect}} a site or burrow from potential competitors. Prior to laying there is a period known as the pre-laying exodus in which both the male and female are away from the colony, building up reserves in order to lay and undertake the first incubation stint respectively. This pre-laying exodus can vary in length from 9 days (as in the Cape petrel) to around 50 days in Atlantic petrels. All procellariids lay one egg per pair per breeding season, in common {{with the rest of the}} <b>Procellariiformes.</b> The egg is large compared to that of other birds, weighing 6–24% of the female's weight. Immediately after laying the female goes back to sea to feed while the male takes over incubation. Incubation duties are shared by both sexes in shifts that vary in length between species, individuals and even the stage of incubation. The longest recorded shift was 29 days by a Murphy's petrel from Henderson Island; the typical length of a gadfly petrel stint is between 13 and 19 days. Fulmarine petrels, shearwaters and prions tend to have shorter stints, averaging between 3 and 13 days. Incubation takes a long time, from 40 days for the smaller species (such as prions) to around 55 days for the larger species. The incubation period is longer if eggs are abandoned temporarily; procellariid eggs are resistant to chilling and can still hatch after being left unattended for a few days.|$|E
25|$|More {{interesting}} - or controversial - is {{the case}} of Neogaeornis. This bird, whose remains were found in Chile, might be a baptornithid also. Others consider it closely related to certain modern birds, either the Gaviiformes, or the <b>Procellariiformes.</b>|$|E

25|$|Austral storm petrels are the {{smallest}} of all the seabirds, {{ranging in size from}} 15–26cm in length. There are two body shapes in the family; the austral storm petrels have short wings, square tails, elongated skulls, and long legs.

25|$|It {{may seem}} that the {{erstwhile}} numbers of seabirds may only ever be approached again by the wholesale eradication of the feral cats. While this has been since shown to be feasible, {{it is not clear}} whether even a severe curtailing of the cat population would be desirable. Though it previously was assumed that the small Polynesian rat is of little if any harm for seabirds, even house mice have been shown to eat seabird nestlings. Most nesting birds, in particularly <b>Procellariiformes,</b> are now accepted to be jeopardized by Rattus exulans. The Kiritimati's cats are meanwhile very fond of young seabirds; it even seems that their behavior has shifted accordingly, with cats being less territorial generally and congregating in numbers at active bird colonies, and generally eschewing rats when seabird chicks are in plenty.|$|E
25|$|John Ruben {{and others}} have argued that no {{evidence}} of nasal turbinates {{has been found in}} dinosaurs. All the dinosaurs they examined had nasal passages that were too narrow and short to accommodate nasal turbinates, so dinosaurs could not have sustained the breathing rate required for a mammal-like or bird-like metabolic rate while at rest, because their lungs would have dried out. However, objections have been raised against this argument. Nasal turbinates are absent or very small in some birds (e.g. ratites, <b>Procellariiformes</b> and Falconiformes) and mammals (e.g. whales, anteaters, bats, elephants, and most primates), although these animals are fully endothermic and in some cases very active. Other studies conclude that nasal turbinates are fragile and seldom found in fossils. In particular none have been found in fossil birds.|$|E

500|$|The {{albatrosses}} are a {{group of}} large to very large birds; they are {{the largest of the}} <b>procellariiformes.</b> The bill is large, strong and sharp-edged, the upper mandible terminating in a large hook. This bill is composed of several horny plates, and along the sides are the two [...] "tubes", long nostrils that give the order its former name. The tubes of all albatrosses are along the sides of the bill, unlike the rest of the <b>Procellariiformes</b> where the tubes run {{along the top of the}} bill. These tubes allow the albatrosses to measure the exact airspeed in flight; the nostrils are analogous to the pitot tubes in modern aircraft. The albatross needs accurate airspeed measurement in order to perform dynamic soaring. Like other <b>Procellariiformes,</b> they use their uniquely developed sense of smell to locate potential food sources, whereas most birds depend on eyesight. The feet have no hind toe and the three anterior toes are completely webbed. The legs are strong for <b>Procellariiformes,</b> making them and the giant petrels the only members of that order which can walk well on land.|$|E
500|$|... {{and most}} modern genera were {{established}} by the Miocene. Thus, a basal radiation of the <b>Procellariiformes</b> in the Eocene at least (as with many modern orders of birds) seems likely, especially given that significant anomalies in molecular evolution rates and patterns have been discovered in the entire family (see also Leach's storm petrel), and molecular dates must be considered extremely tentative. Some genera (Argyrodyptes, Pterodromoides) are only known from fossils. Eopuffinus from the Late Paleocene is sometimes placed in the Procellariidae, but even its placement in the <b>Procellariiformes</b> is quite doubtful.|$|E
500|$|Northern storm petrels are [...] seabirds in {{the family}} Hydrobatidae, part of the order <b>Procellariiformes.</b> The family was once lumped with the similar austral storm petrels in the {{combined}} storm petrels, but have been split as they were not closely related. These smallest of seabirds feed on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. Their flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like.|$|E
500|$|Northern storm petrels are the {{smallest}} of all the seabirds, {{ranging in size from}} 13–25cm in length. [...] The Hydrobatidae have longer wings than the austral storm petrels, forked or wedge-shaped tails and shorter legs.

500|$|The Arctic tern {{holds the}} long-distance {{migration}} record for birds, travelling between Arctic breeding grounds and the Antarctic each year. Some species of tubenoses (<b>Procellariiformes)</b> such as albatrosses circle the earth, {{flying over the}} southern oceans, while others such as Manx shearwaters migrate [...] between their northern breeding grounds and the southern ocean. Shorter migrations are common, including altitudinal migrations on mountains such as the Andes and Himalayas.|$|E
500|$|They {{were once}} {{commonly}} known as goonie birds or gooney birds, particularly those of the North Pacific. In the Southern Hemisphere, the name mollymawk is still well established in some areas, which is a corrupted form of malle-mugge, an old Dutch name for the northern fulmar. The name Diomedea, assigned to the albatrosses by Linnaeus, references the mythical metamorphosis of the companions of the Greek warrior Diomedes into birds. Finally, the name for the order, <b>Procellariiformes,</b> comes from the Latin word procella meaning [...] "a violent wind" [...] or [...] "a storm".|$|E
500|$|Albatrosses, of the {{biological}} family Diomedeidae, are large seabirds related to the procellariids, storm petrels and diving petrels in the order <b>Procellariiformes</b> (the tubenoses). They range widely in the Southern Ocean and the North Pacific. They are absent from the North Atlantic, although fossil remains show they once occurred there and occasional vagrants are found. Albatrosses are among the largest of flying birds, and the great albatrosses (genus Diomedea) have the longest wingspans of any extant birds, reaching up to [...] The albatrosses are usually regarded as falling into four genera, but there is disagreement over the number of species.|$|E
500|$|The most pelagic species, {{mainly in}} the 'tubenose' order <b>Procellariiformes,</b> are great wanderers, and the {{albatrosses}} of the southern oceans may circle the globe as they ride the [...] "roaring forties" [...] outside the breeding season. The tubenoses spread widely over large areas of open ocean, but congregate when food becomes available. Many are also among the longest-distance migrants; sooty shearwaters Puffinus griseus nesting on the Falkland Islands migrate [...] between the breeding colony and the North Atlantic Ocean off Norway. Some Manx shearwaters Puffinus puffinus do this same journey in reverse. As they are long-lived birds, they may cover enormous distances during their lives; one record-breaking Manx shearwater is calculated to have flown 8 million km (5 million miles) during its over-50 year lifespan.|$|E
500|$|There exists {{no single}} {{definition}} of which groups, families and species are seabirds, and most definitions {{are in some}} way arbitrary. In the words of two seabird scientists, [...] "The one common characteristic that all seabirds share is that they feed in saltwater; but, as seems to be true with any statement in biology, some do not." [...] However, by convention all of the Sphenisciformes and <b>Procellariiformes,</b> all of the Pelecaniformes except the darters, {{and some of the}} Charadriiformes (the skuas, gulls, terns, auks and skimmers) are classified as seabirds. The phalaropes are usually included as well, since although they are waders ("shorebirds" [...] in North America), two of the three species are oceanic for nine months of the year, crossing the equator to feed pelagically.|$|E
500|$|After hatching, the chick, {{which is}} semi-altricial, is brooded and guarded {{for three weeks}} until it {{is large enough to}} defend and thermoregulate itself. During this period the parents feed the chick small meals when they relieve each other from duty. After the {{brooding}} period is over, the chick is fed in regular intervals by both parents. The parents adopt alternative patterns of short and long foraging trips, providing meals that weigh around 12% of their body weight (around [...] ). The meals are composed of fresh squid, fish and krill, as well as stomach oil, an energy-rich food that is lighter to carry than undigested prey items. This oil is created in a stomach organ known as a proventriculus from digested prey items by most <b>Procellariiformes,</b> and gives them their distinctive musty smell.|$|E
500|$|The storm petrels, Hydrobatidae, {{are one of}} {{the four}} major {{families}} of the <b>Procellariiformes</b> or [...] "tubenoses", an order of seabirds that also includes the albatrosses, the Procellariidae, and the diving petrels. The family is an ancient group of small species which is thought to have diverged early {{from the rest of the}} tubenoses; the supporting fossil record is poor, with specimens from California dating back only to the Late Miocene (11.6–5.3 million years ago). The Hydrobatidae are often divided into two subfamilies, the mainly southern hemisphere Oceanitinae and the northern Hydrobatinae; cytochrome b DNA sequence analysis suggests that these might be full families. The European storm petrel is the only member of the genus Hydrobates, the remainder of the Hydrobatinae being placed in Oceanodroma, although the least storm petrel is sometimes separated as the sole member of Halocyptena. The relationships within the Hydrobatinae are complex and uncertain, and it has been suggested that all the members of the subfamily could be subsumed into an enlarged Hydrobates.|$|E
500|$|In 1874, English {{zoologist}} Alfred Henry Garrod {{published a}} study {{where he had}} examined various groups of birds and recorded which muscles of a selected group of five [...] they possessed or lacked. Noting that the muscle patterns were different among the steganopodes (classical Pelecaniformes), he resolved that there were divergent lineages in the group that should be in separate families, including frigatebirds in their own family Fregatidae. Urless N. Lanham observed in 1947 that frigatebirds bore some skeletal characteristics {{more in common with}} <b>Procellariiformes</b> than Pelecaniformes, though concluded they still belonged in the latter group (as suborder Fregatae), albeit as an early offshoot. Martyn Kennedy and colleagues derived a cladogram based on behavioural characteristics of the traditional Pelecaniformes, calculating the frigatebirds to be more divergent than pelicans from a core group of gannets, darters and cormorants, and tropicbirds the most distant lineage. The classification of this group as the traditional Pelecaniformes, united by feet that are totipalmate (with all four toes linked by webbing) and the presence of a gular pouch, persisted until the early 1990s. The DNA–DNA hybridization studies of Charles Sibley and Jon Edward Ahlquist placed the frigatebirds in a lineage with penguins, loons, petrels and albatrosses. Subsequent genetic studies place the frigatebirds as a sister group to the group Suloidea, which comprises the gannets and boobies, cormorants and darters. Microscopic analysis of eggshell structure by Konstantin Mikhailov in 1995 found that the eggshells of frigatebirds resembled those of other Pelecaniformes in having a covering of thick microglobular material over the crystalline shells.|$|E
500|$|Storm petrels are monogamous {{and form}} {{long-term}} pair bonds that last {{a number of}} years. Studies of paternity using DNA fingerprinting have shown that, unlike many other monogamous birds, infidelity (extra-pair mating) is very rare. As with the other <b>Procellariiformes,</b> a single egg is laid by a pair in a breeding season; if the egg fails, then usually no attempt is made to re-lay (although it happens rarely). Both sexes incubate in shifts of up to six days. The egg hatches after 40 or 50 days; the young is brooded continuously for another 7 days or so before being left alone in the nest {{during the day and}} fed by regurgitation at night. Meals fed to the chick weigh around 10–20% of the parent's body weight, and consist of both prey items and stomach oil. Stomach oil is an energy rich (its calorific value is around 9600 calories per gram) oil created by partly digested prey {{in a part of the}} foregut known as the proventriculus. By partly converting prey items into stomach oil storm petrels can maximise the amount of energy chicks receive during feed, an advantage for small seabirds that can only make a single visit to the chick during a 24-hour period (at night). The average age at which chicks fledge depends on the species, taking between 50 or 70 days. The time taken to hatch and raise the young is long for the bird's size but is typical of seabirds, which in general are K-selected, living much longer, delay breeding for longer, and invest more effort into fewer young. The young leave there burrow at about 62 days. They are independent almost at once and quickly disperse into the ocean. They return to their original colony after 2 [...] or 3 years, but will not breed until at least 4 years old. Storm petrels have been recorded living as long as 30 years.|$|E
