5|$|In 1787, 1789, and 1790, Dissenters again {{tried to}} repeal the Test and Corporation Acts. Although {{initially}} {{it looked as if}} they might succeed, by 1790, with the fears of revolution looming in Parliament, few were swayed by appeals to equal rights. Political cartoons, {{one of the most effective}} and popular media of the time, skewered the Dissenters and Priestley. In Parliament, William <b>Pitt</b> <b>and</b> Edmund Burke argued against the repeal, a betrayal that angered Priestley and his friends, who had expected the two men's support. Priestley wrote a series of Letters to William <b>Pitt</b> <b>and</b> Letters to Burke in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but these publications only further inflamed the populace against him.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, <b>Pitt</b> <b>and</b> Jolie {{established}} a charitable organization, the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, to aid humanitarian causes around the world. The foundation made initial donations of $1million each to Global Action for Children and Doctors Without Borders, {{followed by an}} October 2006 donation of $100,000 to the Daniel Pearl Foundation, an organization created {{in memory of the}} late American journalist Daniel Pearl. According to federal filings, <b>Pitt</b> <b>and</b> Jolie invested $8.5million into the foundation in 2006; it gave away $2.4million in 2006 and $3.4million in 2007. In June 2009 the Jolie-Pitt Foundation donated $1million to a U.N. refugee agency to help Pakistanis displaced by fighting between troops and Taliban militants. In January 2010 the foundation donated $1million to Doctors Without Borders for emergency medical assistance to help victims of the Haiti earthquake.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pitts</b> <b>and</b> Todd were {{a comedy}} duo from the 1930s, put {{together}} by Hal Roach as the female counterpart to Laurel and Hardy. The duo consisted of actresses Zasu <b>Pitts</b> <b>and</b> Thelma Todd. The team changed members over the years, becoming Todd and Kelly, then Kelly and Kelton, followed by Kelly and Roberti, then finally coming full circle with <b>Pitts</b> <b>and</b> Kelly.|$|R
50|$|Floyd and Burkett {{were found}} dead three days later. They {{had been shot}} to death. After being coerced by the police into making an accusation, {{a woman who was}} with <b>Pitts</b> <b>and</b> Lee accused <b>Pitts</b> <b>and</b> another man of the crime. This other suspect was a soldier who worked for the military, and they {{provided}} an alibi for him. The woman then changed her accusation, accusing <b>Pitts</b> <b>and</b> Lee of the crime.|$|R

5|$|Having {{secured the}} area around Fort Niagara, the British {{launched}} two military expeditions into the west. The first expedition, led by Colonel John Bradstreet, was to travel by boat across Lake Erie and reinforce Detroit. Bradstreet was to subdue the Native Americans around Detroit before marching south into the Ohio Country. The second expedition, commanded by Colonel Bouquet, was to march west from Fort <b>Pitt</b> <b>and</b> form a second front in the Ohio Country.|$|E
5|$|In January 1998, 20th Century Fox {{announced}} that <b>Pitt</b> <b>and</b> Norton were {{cast in the}} film. The actors prepared for their roles by taking lessons in boxing, taekwondo, grappling, and soapmaking. Pitt voluntarily visited a dentist to have pieces of his front teeth chipped off so his character would not have perfect teeth. The pieces were restored after filming concluded.|$|E
5|$|Alexander had {{attended}} Georgia Tech and after graduating as valedictorian {{of his class}} in 1912, taught mathematics at Tech and served as Heisman's assistant coach. In 1920, {{he was given the}} job of head coaching Tech's football team. He retained and Heisman's shift and in his first season he saw Tech win an SIAA title behind captain Buck Flowers, the first Georgia Tech played inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Tech suffered its only loss again to Warner's <b>Pitt,</b> <b>and</b> finished the season with a win over rival Auburn. Tackle Bill Fincher made Camp's first team All-America.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pitts</b> <b>and</b> Stark's nu-calculus is a typed lambda-calculus {{which forms}} {{a basis for}} the study of {{interaction}} between higher-order functions and dynamically created names. A similar approach has received renewed attention recently through Sumii and Pierce's cryptographic lambda-calculus, which deals with security protocols. Logical relations are a powerful tool to prove properties of such a calculus, notably observational equivalence. While <b>Pitts</b> <b>and</b> Stark construct a logical relation for the nu-calculus, it rests heavily on operational aspects of the calculus and is hard to be extended. We propose an alternative Kripke logical relation for the nu-calculus, which is derived naturally from the categorical model of the nu-calculus and the general notion of Kripke logical relation. This is also related to the Kripke logical relation for the name creation monad by Goubault-Larrecq et al. (CSL' 02), which the authors claimed had similarities with <b>Pitts</b> <b>and</b> Stark's logical relation. We show that their Kripke logical relation for names is strictly weaker than <b>Pitts</b> <b>and</b> Stark's. We also show that our Kripke logical relation, which extends the definition of Goubault-Larrecq et al., is equivalent to <b>Pitts</b> <b>and</b> Stark's up to first-order type...|$|R

5|$|Aronofsky {{originally}} planned to direct The Fountain on a $70 million budget with Brad <b>Pitt</b> <b>and</b> Cate Blanchett {{in the lead}} roles, but Pitt's withdrawal and cost overruns led Warner Bros. to shut down his production. The director rewrote the script to be sparser, {{and was able to}} resurrect the film with a $35 million budget with Jackman and Weisz in the lead roles. Production mainly took place on a sound stage in Montreal, Quebec, and the director used macro photography to create key visual effects for The Fountain at a low cost.|$|E

5|$|In 1915 Thomas Beecham and Robert Courtneidge {{presented}} {{a season of}} opera at the Shaftesbury Theatre. Harrison was recruited as a conductor along with Percy Pitt, Hamish MacCunn and Landon Ronald. After a second season with Courtneidge, Beecham set up on his own account in 1916, and established the Beecham Opera Company at the Aldwych Theatre of which his father Sir Joseph Beecham was the lessee. Harrison, <b>Pitt,</b> <b>and</b> Eugene Goossens joined him as assistant conductors. In 1916 Harrison joined the Royal Flying Corps and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the technical branch. He was based in London, and was frequently able to conduct for Beecham, often wearing his uniform.|$|E

In June, David Fincher is confirmed to direct the World War Z sequel, marking <b>Pitt</b> <b>and</b> Fincher's fourth collaboration. Next, Pitt will star in James Gray's deep space epic Ad Astra, in which he will play the slightly autistic space engineer Roy McBride who searches across the galaxy for his father, played by Tommy Lee Jones.|$|E
5|$|In {{an article}} written by Nickie Wang for the Manila Standard Today on 25 March 2009, Boholano actor Cesar Montano {{mentioned}} that {{he was interested in}} producing a feature film on the Eskaya. The following month, Montano announced a working title for the his project, Eskaya: The Quick Brown Fox, and discussed his casting preferences which included the possibility of A-list Hollywood actors like Brad <b>Pitt</b> <b>and</b> Tom Cruise, with Manny Pacquiao in the lead role. The story concerns a wealthy, influential American who is wrongfully implicated in a crime. To prove his innocence he tracks the only witness to the crime into the forests of Bohol where he encounters the Eskaya tribe.|$|E
5|$|Producer Ross Bell {{met with}} actor Russell Crowe {{to discuss his}} {{candidacy}} {{for the role of}} Tyler Durden. Producer Art Linson, who joined the project late, met with Pitt regarding the same role. Linson was the senior producer of the two, so the studio sought to cast Pitt instead of Crowe. Pitt was looking for a new film after the failure (in the US market) of his 1998 film Meet Joe Black, and the studio believed Fight Club would be more commercially successful with a major star. The studio signed <b>Pitt</b> <b>and</b> offered him a US$17.5million salary.|$|E

5|$|The Guardian was {{a former}} two-decked 44-gun frigate, but had been armed en flûte and loaded with stores {{to be taken to}} the British colony at Botany Bay. In {{addition}} to these stores, consisting of seeds, plants, farm machinery and livestock with a total value of some £70,000, the Guardian was also to transport a number of convicts and their overseers. Aboard the Guardian was a young midshipman named Thomas Pitt, the son of politician Thomas <b>Pitt,</b> <b>and</b> nephew of Prime Minister William Pitt.|$|E
5|$|The River Brue rises at Brewham, {{close to}} the county border with Wiltshire. It flows through Bruton and is joined by the rivers <b>Pitt</b> <b>and</b> Alham. The river then flows past East and West Lydford to Baltonsborough and then turns north to Street across Butts Moor, South Moor and Kennard Moor. Originally it then joined the Axe but now it flows west across Westhay Moor, Tealham and Tadham Moors, Chilton Moor, Mark Moor and Huntspill Moor. It is joined by the North Drain and the Hartlake river. In Huntspill Moor the Brue {{is linked to the}} {{man-made}} Huntspill river by the artificial Cripps river. The Brue reaches the sea near Burnham-on-Sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{directed}} by Steve McQueen. The screenplay was written by John Ridley. Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as Solomon Northup. Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Lupita Nyong'o, Sarah Paulson, Brad <b>Pitt,</b> <b>and</b> Alfre Woodard are all featured in supporting roles. Principal photography took place in New Orleans, Louisiana, from June 27 to August 13, 2012. The locations used were four historic antebellum plantations: Felicity, Bocage, Destrehan, and Magnolia. Of the four, Magnolia is nearest to the actual plantation where Northup was held.|$|E

5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, {{the castle}} was armed with nine 36-pounder guns, {{supported}} by further artillery batteries placed along the beach. To protect Deal, units of infantry and cavalry, called fencibles, were formed in 1794 by William Pitt the Younger– then both the Prime Minister and the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports– and in 1802 units of bombardiers recruited by Pitt carried out military exercises at the castle. The politician and banker Lord Carrington carried out {{improvements to the}} castle in 1802, apparently as a rival project to his friend Pitt's work at Walmer. According to Samuel Wilberforce, Carrington had hoped to charge {{the cost of the}} work to the Treasury, but when he attempted to submit the claims, they were rejected by <b>Pitt</b> <b>and</b> he had to pay for the improvements himself.|$|E
5|$|Lord Rockingham, {{with the}} support of <b>Pitt</b> <b>and</b> the King, {{repealed}} Grenville's unpopular Stamp Act, but his government was weak and he was replaced in 1766 by Pitt, whom George created Earl of Chatham. The actions of Lord Chatham and George III in repealing the Act were so popular in America that statues of them both were erected in New York City. Lord Chatham fell ill in 1767, and the Duke of Grafton took over the government, although he did not formally become Prime Minister until 1768. That year, John Wilkes returned to England, stood as a candidate in the general election, and came top of the poll in the Middlesex constituency. Wilkes was again expelled from Parliament. Wilkes was re-elected and expelled twice more, before the House of Commons resolved that his candidature was invalid and declared the runner-up as the victor. Grafton's government disintegrated in 1770, allowing the Tories led by Lord North to return to power.|$|E
5|$|On 26 February 1793, another vote {{to abolish}} the slave trade was {{narrowly}} defeated by eight votes. The outbreak of war with France the same month effectively prevented any further serious consideration of the issue, as politicians concentrated on the national crisis {{and the threat of}} invasion. The same year, and again in 1794, Wilberforce unsuccessfully brought before Parliament a bill to outlaw British ships from supplying slaves to foreign colonies. He voiced his concern about the war and urged <b>Pitt</b> <b>and</b> his government to make greater efforts to end hostilities. Growing more alarmed, on 31 December 1794, Wilberforce moved that the government seek a peaceful resolution with France, a stance that created a temporary breach in his long friendship with Pitt.|$|E
