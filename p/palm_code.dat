Palmprint ROI segmentation and feature extraction are two important issues in palm print recognition. This paper introduces two steps {{in the center of}} mass moment method for ROI segmentation that will be applied in the Gabor 2 D filter to obtain <b>palm</b> <b>code</b> as palmprint feature vector. Normalized Hamming distance was used to measure the similarity degrees of two feature vectors of palmprint.

40|$|We have {{proposed}} {{in this paper}} an embedded palmprint recognition system using the dual-core OMAP 3530 platform. An improved algorithm based on <b>palm</b> <b>code</b> was proposed first. In this method, a Gabor wavelet is first convolved with the palmprint image to produce a response image, where local binary patterns are then applied to code the relation among the magnitude of wavelet response at the ccentral pixel with that of its neighbors. The method is fully tested using the public PolyU palmprint database. While <b>palm</b> <b>code</b> achieves only about 89 % accuracy, over 96 % accuracy is achieved by the proposed G-LBP approach. The proposed algorithm was then deployed to the DSP processor of OMAP 3530 and work together with the ARM processor for feature extraction. When complicated algorithms run on the DSP processor, the ARM processor can focus on image capture, user interface and peripheral control. Integrated with an image sensing module and central processing board, the designed device can achieve accurate and real time performance...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{is to create a}} library that will allow its users to control 3 D {{applications}} by using one or both of their hands. The final product could easily be incorporated into 3 D applications, each customized to utilize a set of poses. Even though off-the-shelf motion capture gloves have reached lower prices in recent years, they are still expensive for home users. The algorithm suggested is based only on a single webcam combined with <b>coded</b> <b>palm</b> and fingers. Users should be able to code {{one or more of the}} fingers. One webcam is still somewhat constraining as two should ideally be used for 3 D mapping of the hand, but by additionally using <b>palm</b> and finger <b>coding</b> we can greatly improve precision and, most importantly, reduce the processing power required for feasible real-time 3 D interaction. ...|$|R

40|$|In present study, EgSAPK (EU 805512), an oil <b>palm</b> {{transcript}} <b>coding</b> for a putative SAPK protein kinase, {{have been}} molecular characterized. The cDNA for EgSAPK isolated from an oil palm cell suspension culture is 1470 bp in length with a longest Open Reading Frame (ORF) of 963 bp. No translation start codon {{could be identified}} so EgSAPK cDNA sequence is lacking the 5 ’-end. The deduced protein sequence shares 89 % identity with the serine/threonine protein kinase SAPK 9 from rice (AB 125310. 1). Real time PCR {{results showed that the}} expression levels of EgSAPK varied in different oil palm tissues and the EgSAPK gene shares a similar expression pattern with the SAPK gene of rice. Furthermore, the transcription of the EgSAPK gene in green embryo, white embryo and embryogenic calli tissues were higher than in non-embryogenic calli tissues. Southern blot analysis showed that the EgSAPK gene might be present as a single copy gene in the oil palm genome. These results suggest that EgSAPK may have a similar function as the SAPK gene of rice and thus can be a candidate marker for oil palm somatic embryogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Angela Carter’s The Passion of New Eve, {{published}} in 1977, is an “in-between text, ” a turning-point, a confusing space of transformation, that marks a gradual yet {{radical change in}} the Carterian corpus. After her realistic Bristol Trilogy (Shadow Dance, Several Perceptions, Love), static texts, called mausoleum-like cabinets of curiosities by Lorna Sage (Sage 1994 b: 11), the rigid science-fictional dystopia, Heroes and Villains and the violent surrealist collage of The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman, Carter seems to turn decisively towards joyously turbulent, fantastic, picaresque allegorical adventures, energetic speculative fictions vitalized by a polyphonic magical realist voice— a voice that {{becomes more and more}} overtly charged with an ironic ideology of criticism and a feminist politics. Carter’s novels, in their chronological succession, shift gradually from a static gloomy realism to a dynamic picaresque magical realism, from ruthless heroes to witty heroines, from obsession with patriarchs to the celebration of daughters, and as Paulina <b>Palmer</b> claims, from <b>coded</b> mannequin to bird woman, from femininity as masochist entrapment to femininity as feminist self-realization (Palmer, 1984).

40|$|The phenological {{stages of}} oil <b>palm</b> can be <b>coded</b> using the BBCH scale, which has three digits {{due to the}} {{inclusion}} of intermediate stages between the principal and secondary stages {{in order to provide}} greater detail on each developmental stage. For the phenological description of the reproductive development of Elaeis oleifera, the principal stages used were emergence of inflorescence, flowering, fruit growth and development, and fruit ripening. The observations were made in Colombia over a 12 month-period on E. oleifera palms planted in 1991; the observations were made on the daily course or depending on the development stage. The duration of each phenological stage was measured in days. Thus, the appearance of new leaves took 20. 1 ± 2. 8 days, reaching preanthesis I (601) took 145. 09 ± 19. 61 days, from this stage to preanthesis II (602) took 7. 50 ± 1. 50 days, then to preanthesis III (603) took 7. 39 ± 1. 56 days and finally to anthesis (607) took 5. 74 ± 1. 32 days.

40|$|Biometric person {{identification}} {{refers to}} the recognition of a person based on the physical or behavioral traits. Palm print based biometric identification system {{is one of the}} low cost biometric systems, since the palm image can be obtained using low cost sensors, such as desktop scanners and web cameras. Because of ease of image acquisition of palm prints and identification accuracy, palm images are used in both uni- modal and multimodal biometric systems. A multi-scale and multi-directional representation is desirable to represent thick and scattered thin lines of a palm image. Multi-scale and multi-directional representation can also be used in image fusion, where two images of two different biometric traits can be fused to a single image to improve the identification accuracy. Face and palm images can be fused to keep the desired high pass information of the palm images and the low pass information of the face images. The Curvelet transform is a multi-scale and multi-directional geometric transform that provides a better representation of the objects with edges and requires a small number of curvelet coefficients to represent the curves. In this thesis, two methods using the very desirable characteristics of the curvelet transform are proposed for both the uni-modal and bi-modal biometric systems. A <b>palm</b> curvelet <b>code</b> (PCC) for <b>palm</b> print based uni-modal biometric systems and a pixel-level fusion method for face and palm based bi-modal biometric systems are developed. A simple binary coding technique that represents the structural information in curvelet directional sub-bands is used to obtain the PCC. Performance of the PCC is evaluated for both identification and verification modes of a palm print based biometric system, and then, the use of PCC in hierarchical identification is investigated. In the pixel-level fusion scheme for a bi-modal system, face and palm images are fused in the curvelet transform domain using mean-mean fusion rule. Extensive experimentations are carried out on three publicly available palm databases and one face database to evaluate the performance in terms of the commonly used metrics, and it is shown that the proposed methods provide a better performance compared to other existing methods. ...|$|R
