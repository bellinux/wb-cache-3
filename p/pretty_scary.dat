500|$|Spears {{explained}} that since {{she did not}} tour to promote Blackout, she was excited about having to include songs from that album into the setlist. The finished setlist would include three songs from Circus, six songs from Blackout and five songs from In the Zone (2003); {{other parts of the}} setlist consist of a medley of [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] and [...] "Touch of My Hand", both from In the Zone; and a remix of [...] "...Baby One More Time", the only song performed off the album of the same name (1998). [...] "Everytime" [...] was the only song not included in the released setlist but was performed regularly on the show. Magician Ed Alonzo joined Spears in one of the acts, and she played as his assistant. Alonzo stated, [...] "We're going to be doing the classics of magic but a little high-tech. We'll be doing a little dissection, transposition, a vanish, an appearance— and if I do a trick, she doesn't just hold the props, she's actually getting inside the big boxes or I am slicing her up. ... Some of it's <b>pretty</b> <b>scary,</b> but she gets right in there with no reservations." [...] The costumes were designed by Dean and Dan Caten from DSquared2. They recreated classic circus outfits, like clowns, jugglers and trapeze artists in a more provocative way. They commented that, ...|$|E

He could be a complete pig, you know. He could charm the birds out of the trees, but he could be a brute." ...|$|E

500|$|FernGully {{received}} generally positive reviews. The film {{holds an}} approval rating of 71% at Rotten Tomatoes based on 14 reviews. Film critic Roger Ebert gave it {{three out of}} four stars, saying the film was visually [...] "very pleasing," [...] told a [...] "useful lesson", [...] "and although the movie is not a masterpiece it's pleasant to watch for its humor and sweetness." [...] Hollis Chacona from The Austin Chronicle added that the film was [...] "funny, <b>pretty,</b> touching, <b>scary,</b> magical stuff." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times had an unfavourable impression of the film, describing it as [...] "n uncertain blend of sanctimonious principles and Saturday-morning cartoon aesthetics".

2500|$|In July 2004, the Wallflowers {{returned}} to the studio to record their fifth album, Rebel, Sweetheart. This time the band decided to record in Atlanta, Georgia, which is where their producer for this album, Brendan O'Brien, is based. O'Brien also contributed on guitar. Fred Eltringham joined the Wallflowers as their new drummer. Jakob Dylan wrote the songs, of which keyboardist Rami Jaffee has said: [...] "What I did notice {{is that kind of}} upbeat song with some <b>pretty</b> <b>scary</b> lyrics."

2500|$|Onstage, Big Black {{presented}} an intense spectacle {{to match their}} music. Albini would set off a brick of firecrackers onstage before the band played, a tradition he carried on from their earliest performances through their dissolution and revived for their 2006 reunion set, and would count in most songs by yelling [...] "One, two, fuck you!" [...] While playing, the band members would slam their hands against their steel guitar strings so hard that they would draw blood, often needing to put adhesive bandages on their fingers. Albini used a specially-made hip-slung guitar strap worn around his waist like a belt, and would [...] "prowl the stage like a spindly gunslinger", according to Azerrad. Gerard Cosloy recalls that [...] "It looked like someone had plugged Steve into the amp [...] he was <b>pretty</b> <b>scary</b> to watch onstage." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, Tiner {{noted in}} an {{interview}} that the returning Edwin Edwards, poised to win his fourth and final term as governor, was dependent on disillusioned supporters of former Governor Buddy Roemer, a Democrat-turned-Republican, to provide victory over then State Representative David Duke, the one-time figure in the Ku Klux Klan who was opposed by nearly two thirds of Louisiana voters. According to Tiner, [...] "The Duke vote is impenetrable. It's going to be there even if a tidal wave rolls across the state. Edwards is dependent on the Roemer voters who despised him four years ago -- he was the dragon Buddy Roemer promised to slay. That's a <b>pretty</b> <b>scary</b> prospect if you're sitting in Edwards's seat." [...] As it turned out, Tiner appeared to have overrated Duke's electoral appeal in 1991, and Roemer's father had been Edwards' first campaign manager commissioner of administration in the first two Edwards terms.|$|E

I wrote about it on our website, certain things sort of haunt you in your life. That's where the title [...] comes from, it's like a brain surgery." ...|$|E

I think there is an artistry to the fall, the colors are really inspiring." [...] Stephan Franck also spoke about the film's take on The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, saying: [...] "We didn't want to do something <b>pretty</b> <b>scary,</b> like the Tim Burton version Sleepy Hollow, because it's a different audience. We went in the direction of making him ghostly, so he's kind of a glow-in-the-dark ghost -- it says scary, and it gives you all the visual intensity, but it doesn't have the darkness of something that wouldn't be right for our audience." ...|$|E

For a bull his size, super-athletic {{is the best way}} to explain him doing it at this level. That's amazing. He's a bull that went for a long time without getting ridden, and then some of the best rides I've seen have been from that bull. Justin McBride and Renato Nunes are two that come to mind. He was an exceptional bull." [...] Ben Jones said, [...] "He was big and had two horns as big as baseball bats, so if you were going to get him rode you had to be a bull rider.

5000|$|Jerry Cantrell said of {{the song}} in a 1993 {{interview}} wth RIP Magazine:We in Chains definitely have a very sarcastic sense of humor even toward ourselves. You {{have to be able}} to laugh at yourself. The music is a way for us to let some serious things out because we're not really talkative people. It's hard for a lot of people to talk about emotions that are really deep pain and hurt and shit like that. [...] "Them Bones" [...] is pretty cut and dried. It's a little sarcastic, but it's pretty much about dealing with your mortality and life. Everybody's going to die someday. Instead of being afraid of it, that's the way it is: so enjoy the time you've got. Live as much as you can, have as much fun as possible. Face your fear and live. I had family members die at a fairly early age; so I've always had kind of a phobia about it. Death freaks me out. I think it freaks a lot of people out. It's the end of life, depending on your views. It's a <b>pretty</b> <b>scary</b> thing. [...] "Them Bones" [...] is trying to put that thought to rest. Use what you have left, and use it well.|$|E
