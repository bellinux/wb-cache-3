50|$|The main {{advantage}} of <b>phytoextraction</b> is environmental friendliness. Traditional methods {{that are used}} for cleaning up heavy metal-contaminated soil disrupt soil structure and reduce soil productivity, whereas <b>phytoextraction</b> can clean up the soil without causing any kind of harm to soil quality.

50|$|This {{process is}} very similar to <b>phytoextraction</b> in that it removes {{contaminants}} by trapping them into harvestable plant biomass. Both <b>phytoextraction</b> and rhizofiltration follow the same basic path to remediation. First, plants are put in contact with the contamination. They absorb contaminants through their root systems and store them in root biomass and/or transport them up into the stems and/or leaves. The plants continue to absorb contaminants until they are harvested. The plants are then replaced to continue the growth/harvest cycle until satisfactory levels of contaminant are achieved. Both processes are also aimed more toward concentrating and precipitating heavy metals than organic contaminants. The major difference between rhizofiltration and <b>phytoextraction</b> is that rhizofiltration is used for treatment in aquatic environments, while <b>phytoextraction</b> deals with soil remediation.|$|E

50|$|It is not {{yet clear}} that Kali would be a useful species for {{commercial}} <b>phytoextraction,</b> either for phytoremediation or for phytomining, but there are genetic variables that could in principle be selected for, should it begin to look worth while.

Some, such as arsenate pass through phosphate metabolic processes before winding up bound by sulfur groups.|$|E
50|$|In <b>phytoextraction</b> (also phytoaccumulation, phytosequesteration or phytoabsorption) plants carry {{radioactive}} waste from the root {{system to the}} vascular tissue and become concentrated in the biomass of shoots. It is a technique that removes radionuclides without destroying the soil structure, with minimal impact on soil fertility and valid for large areas with {{a low level of}} radioactivity. Its efficiency is evaluated through bioaccumulation coefficient (BC) or total removal of radionuclides per m2, and is proven to attract cesium-137, strontium-90, technetium-99, cerium-144, plutonium-240, americium-241, neptunium-237 and various radioisotopes of thorium and radium. By contrast, it requires large biomass production in short periods of time.|$|E
50|$|In another model {{ecosystem}} experiment Schulin's team found that moderate topsoil pollution by heavy metals significantly reduced evapotranspiration {{of a young}} forest vegetation due to reduced root growth, in particular during periods of drought stress, and that roots compensated for metal toxicity in the topsoil by increasing water extraction from the subsoil. It could also be demonstrated that the biodegradable chelant EDDS {{can be used to}} enhance <b>phytoextraction</b> of polluting metals by mobilizing the metals in the soil, although metal-EDDS complexes are less available for uptake by roots through the symplastic pathway than free metal ions.|$|E
50|$|Phyto{{stabilization}} {{focuses on}} the long term stabilization and containment of the pollutant. For example, the plant's presence can reduce wind erosion; or the plant's roots can prevent water erosion, immobilize the pollutants by adsorption or accumulation, and provide a zone around the roots where the pollutant can precipitate and stabilize. Unlike <b>phytoextraction,</b> phytostabilization focuses mainly on sequestering pollutants in soil near the roots but not in plant tissues. Pollutants become less bioavailable, and livestock, wildlife, and human exposure is reduced. An example application of this sort is using a vegetative cap to stabilize and contain mine tailings.|$|E
50|$|However, {{these plants}} also show promise as hyperaccumulators for {{phytoremediation}} by <b>phytoextraction,</b> {{the absorption of}} certain classes of toxic or at least undesirable chemicals from the soil. Commonly these are ions of heavy metals, such as cadmium (Cd(II)), chromium (both Cr(III) and Cr(VI)), lead (Pb(II)), arsenic (both As(III) and As(V)), copper (Cu(II)), nickel (Ni(II)), and zinc (Zn(II)). Such processes have been studied in Kali for all those ions, and others such as iron and cobalt.

In the experiment, HM-polluted soil is mixed at different ratios with unpolluted soil of comparable composition to mimic the gradual decrease of the HM content in the target HM-polluted soil during <b>phytoextraction.</b> After equilibrating the soil mixtures, one cropping cycle is carried out with the plant species of interest. At harvest, the adsorbed HM contents in the soil and the HM contents in the plant shoots are determined. The adsorbed HM contents in the soil are then related to the HM contents in the plant shoots by a log-log linear relationship that can then be used to estimate the <b>phytoextraction</b> duration of a specific HM-polluted soil.

Large decreases in metal desorption rate constants evaluated by DIFS were found in calcareous soils. Sequential extraction indicated that the acid-soluble metal fraction was easily removed by S. plumbizincicola from acid soils but not from calcareous soils. Reducible and oxidisable metal fractions showed discernible decreases in acid and calcareous soils, indicating that S. plumbizincicola can mobilize non-labile metal for uptake but the residual metal cannot be removed. The results indicate that <b>phytoextraction</b> significantly decreases metal availability by reducing metal pool sizes and/or desorption rates and that S. plumbizincicola plays an important role in the mobilization of less active metal fractions during repeated <b>phytoextraction.</b> (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|<b>Phytoextraction</b> {{for heavy}} metals is an {{emerging}} technology that has potential application for the remediation of many contaminated {{sites around the}} world. The technology has similar application to the mining of low-grade ore bodies. Several practical aspects of the technology are addressed in this thesis. Natural and induced-uptake <b>phytoextraction</b> trials have been conducted on two contaminated substrates: an area of industrial pollution in northern France, where base metals are present in an oxide and carbonate mineral phase, and an area of mine tailings in New Zealand, where base metals are present in a sulphide or sulphate mineral phase. The uptake response of several hyperaccumulator and non-accumulator plant species is described. Geochemical models are then presented that explain the observed metal uptake {{as a function of}} the predominant chemical form of metal present in the soil. Natural uptake is dependent upon the form of metal. It appears that the relative efficacy of various hyperaccumulator species to accumulate metals is also dependent upon site-specific geochemistry. The efficacy of chelating agents, in particular EDTA, to induce uptake is similarly dependent upon the chemical form of metals in the soil. A field trial for cadmium <b>phytoextraction</b> was conducted on an area of pastoral land contaminated with this metal due to the application of cadmium to soil through superphosphate fertilisation. Natural uptake at this site by the hyperaccumulator species Thlaspi caerulescens could remove the equivalent of 17 years of annual cadmium application in one harvest. The chelating agent EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) did not induce significant uptake by the non-accumulator Brassica species. Instead, the action of this chemical was to redistribute 14 % of the cadmium initially present in the 0 - 5 cm soil depth to the 5 - 10 cm depth, and to leach approximately 4 % of the cadmium initially present at the site to below 10 cm in the soil profile, as shown by mass balance calculations. <b>Phytoextraction</b> effected by T. caerulescens is proposed as a management tool for cadmium in the pastoral environment. <b>Phytoextraction</b> for nickel has been investigated at a field site in the central North Island of New Zealand. Hyperaccumulation was effected by two Alyssum species and by Berkheya coddii. However, the biomass of the harvested plant material was below that reported in the literature. The conclusion from this trial is that substrate modification of ultramafic soil may be necessary before <b>phytoextraction</b> for nickel could be implemented. A significant obstacle hindering the practical application of <b>phytoextraction</b> in some environments, is the paucity of hyperaccumulator species that are native to some parts of the world. Western Australia has many sites that may benefit from <b>phytoextraction</b> for nickel. However, only one hyperaccumulator species is native to this region, Hybanthus floribundus, a species that has in the past been difficult to germinate from seed. This thesis describes a successful approach to germination, involving the use of one-year-old seeds, treated with 'Regen 2000 smoke water' and germinated under dark conditions, that may overcome this practical aspect (a limitation) of <b>phytoextraction</b> technology. The most recent advance of induced <b>phytoextraction</b> technology has been the thioligand-induced uptake of gold by plants. The initial discovery and the geochemical rationale behind the induced uptake of gold is described. The maximum gold uptake presented is accumulation of 57 mg/kg dry weight gold by Brassica juncea and it is proposed that this level of uptake could make the phytomining of gold from tailings areas an economic proposition. The conclusion of this thesis is that potential for the implementation of <b>phytoextraction</b> is large. Globally, the technology could offer an environmentally and economically friendly alternative to the traditional decontamination of metals from some sites. There is also potential for the phytomining of metals from low-grade ores. The social implications of <b>phytoextraction</b> technology in third-world countries could also be large. <b>Phytoextraction</b> for gold, for example, from auriferous tailings in Africa and South America, has the potential to improve both the environment and the standard of living of the local communities who live off contaminated land...|$|E
