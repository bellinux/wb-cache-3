500|$|The {{predecessor}} of {{the hand}} cannon, the fire lance, was a spear tied with a bamboo or <b>paper</b> <b>barrel</b> that could fire projectiles. The transition between the fire lance to the cannon or hand cannon was gradual, so literary references to a weapon called huotong ( [...] ; [...] "fire tube") can either denote fire lances or metal-barrel firearms. The Xingjun Xuzhi ( [...] ; [...] "What an Army Commander in the Field ought to Know") dated 1230, lists huotong among other gunpowder weapons, but may refer to either a fire lance or a hand cannon. This has been attested to by surviving metal cannons and hand cannons in China from the 13th and 14th centuries.|$|E

50|$|The Chinese fire lance was {{the direct}} {{predecessor}} {{to the modern}} concept of the firearm. It was not a gun itself, but an addition to the soldiers' spears. Originally it consisted of <b>paper</b> or bamboo <b>barrels</b> that would have incendiary gunpowder within it, that could be lit one time and would project flames at the enemy. Sometimes the Chinese troops would place small projectiles within the barrel that would also be projected when the gunpowder was lit, {{but most of the}} explosive force would create flames. Later, the barrel was changed to be made of metal, so that a more explosive gunpowder could be used and put more force into the propulsion of the projectile.|$|R
40|$|Previous crystallographic {{analyses}} of the Kunitz inhibitors from soybean, Erythrina ca#ra and wheat, the interleukins-lb and la and the acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors have shown that they contain a most unusual fold. It is formed by six two-stranded hairpins. Three of these form a barrel structure {{and the other three}} are in a triangular array that caps the barrel. The arrangement of the secondary structures gives the molecules a pseudo 3 -fold axis. Although the different proteins have very similar structures, many of their sequences have no significant similarities overall. The structural determinants of this fold are described and discussed in this <b>paper.</b> The <b>barrels</b> in the different proteins have the same geometrical features: six strands tilted at 56 ” to the barrel axis; a barrel diameter of 16 A, and the b-sheet hydrogen bonded so that it is staggered with a shear number of 12. These features fit McLachlan’s equations for ideal barrels formed by P-sheets. The wide diameter of the barrels is filled by layers of residues that, while not identical in the different proteins, are, in almost all cases, large. The structure of the triangular array of hairpins is determined by the coiling of the strands and the packing of hairpin residues against each other and against residues from the interior o...|$|R
2500|$|When {{the storm}} had abated, the men built a raft from planks and barrels and sent two men to shore. The raft broke up in the waves, and both men drowned. After making a second, more solid, raft, the others {{were able to make}} it safely to shore. Over the next few days they {{returned}} to the ship daily to retrieve cargo, managing to salvage some of La Salle's <b>papers</b> and clothes, <b>barrels</b> of flour, casks of wine, glass beads, and other trade items. Before long, however, a strong southerly wind drove the hull into the muddy bottom, and soon only the rear deck remained above water. Of the 27people originally assigned to the ship, the only survivors were Tessier, a priest, a military officer, a regular soldier, a servant girl, and a small boy. They remained on the peninsula for three months, as the only way to the fort was to walk through Karankawa territory. [...] After a small Indian canoe washed ashore one day, the survivors were able to paddle across the bay and return to the fort. The destruction of their last ship left the settlers stranded on the Texas coast, with no hope of any assistance from the French colonies in the Caribbean Sea.|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that an axial piston pump barrel {{experiences}} small oscillations due to forces acting over it. Cavitation als o occurs in many cases, damaging the plate and barrel sliding surfaces and therefore reducing the volumetric and overall efficiency of the pump. More importantly, the resulting failure of the pump is often a critical issue in modern industrial applications. The complex fluctuation movement of the barrel while turning around the piston pump axis, has been experimentally evaluated in this <b>paper,</b> also the <b>barrel</b> plate film thickness will be experimentally studied, showing that {{a large amount of}} the piston pump leakage occurs between the barrel/plate gap. The present paper demonstrates the importance of properly designing the barrel/plate sliding surface. Some of the paper conclusions are that the film thickness between the barrel and the plate sharply decreases as oil temperature increases, mixed lubrication appears under most of the conditions studied and it is especially severe at high temperatures. With regards to the barrel dynamics two main frequencies appear, one related to the torque created when each pis ton enters and leaves the pressure kidney port, and a much higher frequency due to the elastic and plastic metal to metal contact.
