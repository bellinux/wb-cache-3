500|$|A simple form of {{directional}} coupler is two <b>parallel</b> <b>transmission</b> lines coupled together over a λ/4 length. [...] This design is limited because the electrical {{length of the}} coupler will only be λ/4 at one specific frequency. [...] Coupling will be a maximum at this frequency and fall away on either side. [...] Similar to the impedance matching case, this can be improved by using multiple elements, resulting in a filter-like structure. [...] A waveguide analogue of this coupled lines approach is the Bethe-hole {{directional coupler}} in which two parallel waveguides are stacked {{on top of each}} other and a hole provided for coupling. [...] To produce a wideband design, multiple holes are used along the guides [...] as shown in figure 14 and a filter design applied. [...] It is not only the coupled-line design that suffers from being narrow band, all simple designs of waveguide coupler depend on frequency in some way. [...] For instance the rat-race coupler (which can be implemented directly in waveguide) works on a completely different principle but still relies on certain lengths being exact in terms of λ.|$|E
500|$|The branch-line coupler {{consists}} of two <b>parallel</b> <b>transmission</b> lines physically coupled together with two or more branch lines between them. [...] The branch lines are spaced λ/4 apart and represent sections of a multi-section filter design {{in the same way}} as the multiple sections of a coupled line coupler except that here the coupling of each section is controlled with the impedance of the branch lines. [...] The main and coupled line are [...] of the system impedance. [...] The more sections there are in the coupler, the higher is the ratio of impedances of the branch lines. [...] High impedance lines have narrow tracks and this usually limits the design to three sections in planar formats due to manufacturing limitations. [...] A similar limitation applies for coupling factors looser than low coupling also requires narrow tracks. [...] Coupled lines are a better choice when loose coupling is required, but branch-line couplers are good for tight coupling and can be used for [...] hybrids. [...] Branch-line couplers usually do not have such a wide bandwidth as coupled lines. [...] This style of coupler is good for implementing in high-power, air dielectric, solid bar formats as the rigid structure is easy to mechanically support.Matthaei et al., pp.809–811Räisänen and Lehto, p.127 ...|$|E

In this paper, we develop a novel MAC scheme for Wireless Mesh Networks based on a TDMA approach and using directional antennas. Our main objective behind this proposal is {{to respond to the}} main directional MAC problems such as deafness and hidden terminal problems caused by the lack in knowledge at each wireless node about its neighboring transmissions. The contribution of our MAC scheme is twofold. First, in enabling <b>parallel</b> <b>transmissions</b> and second in maintaining a full knowledge at each wireless node about neighboring <b>transmissions.</b> Using <b>parallel</b> <b>transmissions,</b> a busy node will not miss the start of a neighboring transmission.

5000|$|In telecommunications, <b>parallel</b> <b>transmission</b> is the {{simultaneous}} {{transmission of the}} signal elements of a character or other entity of data. In digital communications, <b>parallel</b> <b>transmission</b> is {{the simultaneous}} transmission of related signal elements over two or more separate paths. Multiple electrical wires are used which can transmit multiple bits simultaneously, which allows for higher data transfer rates than can be achieved with serial transmission. This method is used internally within the computer, for example the internal buses, and sometimes externally {{for such things as}} printers, The major issue with this is [...] "skewing" [...] because the wires in parallel data transmission have slightly different properties (not intentionally) so some bits may arrive before others, which may corrupt the message. A parity bit can help to reduce this. However, electrical wire parallel data transmission is therefore less reliable for long distances because corrupt transmissions are far more likely.|$|E
40|$|Traditional MAC {{protocols}} with CSMA often {{assume that}} a transmission must be deferred if the channel is busy, so they {{focus more on the}} optimization of serial transmission performance. Recent advances in physical layer like Message in Message (MIM), however, allows a receiver to reengage onto a stronger incoming signal from an ongoing transmission or interference, and thus shows the potential of <b>parallel</b> <b>transmissions.</b> Indeed, even if the channel is busy, a node still has opportunities to carry out a successful transmission. In this study, we propose Opportunistic Concurrency (OPC), a new MAC layer scheme, which enables sensor nodes to capture the opportunistic concurrency and carry out <b>parallel</b> <b>transmissions</b> instead of always waiting for a clear channel. Our experiments on a testbed consisting of 60 TelosB sensor motes identify the transmission opportunities in WSNs with OPC.

30|$|Opposite to the {{observations}} presented beforehand, the MUD-based MUD-MAC can not only handle the interference situation, but even increase the spatial reuse in the high traffic scenario by fully exploiting all four decoder branches. This is shown by comparing {{the left and the}} right hand side of Figure 8. While in the right part for the 500 m scenario never more than two <b>parallel</b> <b>transmissions</b> are within communication range which is mostly the case in the medium density scenario, in the left part for the 50 m scenario all four branches are exploited, leading to four <b>parallel</b> <b>transmissions.</b> From the above presented results it can be observed that power control-based CLDs can only be applied in medium density interference situations, whereas MUD in interaction with an appropriate MAC layer is also applicable if the interference situation gets severe. The gain achievable scales thereby in high interference situations with the number of decoder branches, but also low-complexity two-branch MUD receiver can handle the severe interference situation cp. Figure 6. Since power control-based CLD cannot be applied in severe interference situations, we restrict all further performed simulations to the medium node density scenario.|$|R
50|$|The {{universal}} asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) takes bytes of {{data and}} transmits the individual bits in a sequential fashion.

30|$|Finally, {{it should}} be noted that {{although}} the demonstrated SDM VLC system consists of only four SDM channels, it is feasible to be extended to more channels since the optical signals from different channels can be always clearly separated by the fisheye lens. As a result, it is potential to further multiply the system capacity by utilizing more LEDs for high-speed <b>parallel</b> <b>transmissions.</b> In addition, for practical application, a detector array integrated with the fisheye lens should be employed to receive the SDM signals, and misalignment between the projected image and the element of the detector array could happen, especially in the scenarios with moving or random-positioned receivers. In this case, the SDM scheme will become a typical spatial-multiplexing MIMO system as shown in our previous work [18], and with the MIMO demultiplexing process, the signal can be recovered. It has been indicated that the fisheye-lens-based imaging receiver scheme has superior performance on demultiplexing of the MIMO signals, and it can potentially realize high-speed <b>parallel</b> <b>transmissions</b> with little interchannel interference [18]. The detailed experimental analysis of the fisheye-lens-based MIMO VLC transmission will be left for a future study.|$|R
