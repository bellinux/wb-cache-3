During Haury's {{excavations}} eleven houses of several types were excavated. An abundance of artifacts were uncovered including <b>pottery,</b> <b>clay</b> objects, grinding stones, projectile points, {{as well as several}} burials.|$|E
25|$|The x-ray {{diffraction}} {{of a sample}} from an unfired lump of <b>pottery</b> <b>clay</b> excavated at the Zebree (3MS20) site confirmed that the shell was burned before being added to the raw clay. Burning the shells eliminates the organic binder and the cooled, burnt shells are easily crushed into a shell temper of fine plate-like particles, some nearly powder. The hinges of the shells are discarded. Using burned shells is logical as unburned mussel shells are hard and very durable. In terms of soil technology, the addition of shell (calcium carbonate) {{has the effect of}} neutralizing the ionic charge of the clay particles. During the course of replicative pottery experiments, as the shell was added to the clay in the presence of water, distinct and immediate changes took place in the feel of the clay. With the valence neutral, the clay-temper combination produces a very satisfactory <b>pottery</b> <b>clay.</b> This modification of backswamp clay - particles now clumping instead of constantly slipping - into a well-behaved modeling clay would have been immediately noticed by the experienced prehistoric potter.|$|E

2500|$|The {{clay body}} is a {{necessary}} component of <b>pottery.</b> <b>Clay</b> must be mined and purified in an often laborious process, and certain tribes have ceremonial protocols to gathering clay. Different tribes have different processes for processing clay, which can include drying in the sun, soaking in water for days, and repeatedly running through a screen or sieve. Acoma and other Pueblo pottery traditionally pound dry clay into a powder and then remove impurities by hand, then running the dry powder through a screen, mixing it with a dry temper, and then mixing water to create a plastic paste. In preparing the clay, potters spend hours wedging it to remove air pockets and humidity that could easily cause it to explode during firing. The clay then needs to [...] "cure" [...] over time.|$|E

40|$|Suitable {{methods for}} the {{assessment}} of the effect of freeze-thaw action upon ceramic tiles have been determined. The results obtained {{have been shown to be}} reproducible with some work in this area still warranted. The analysis of Whichford <b>Potteries</b> <b>clays</b> via a variety of analytical techniques has shown them to be a complex mix of both clay and non-clay minerals. 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy has highlighted the presence of both small and large particleα-Fe 203, removable via acid washing. 19 F MAS NMR has demonstrated that the raw Whichford <b>Pottery</b> <b>clays</b> examined have negligible fluorine content. This is unlikely to be detrimental to ceramic wares during the heating process. A unique technique was used for the identification of fluorine in solid-state systems. The exchange of various cations into Wyoming Bentonite clay by microwave methodology did not show the appearance of five co-ordinate aluminium when examined by 27 Al MAS NMR. The appearance of Qo silicate was linked to an increase in the amount of tetrahedrally bound aluminium in the silicate framework. This is formed as a result of the heating process. The analysis of two Chinese clays and two Chinese clay raw materials has highlighted a possible link between the two. These have also been shown to be a mix of both clay and non-clay minerals. Layered double hydroxides formed by conventional and microwave methods exhibited interesting characteristics. The main differences between the samples examined were not found to be solely attributable to the differences between microwave and conventional methods but more attributable to different experimental conditions used...|$|R

When kiln-fired, the paper burns out, leaving the clay body. Consequently, the firing temperatures and glazes selection should be the same on those used with the clay body.|$|E
