5|$|Cantacuzino {{ended his}} <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>reflection</b> in January 1915, when he openly {{supported}} Alexandru Marghiloman {{in creating a}} pro-German subgroup within the Conservative Party. Jeopardizing their standing in the party, both men cited irregularities in the Conservative caucus.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Germany {{took over}} the {{rotating}} EU Presidency and declared the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>reflection</b> over. By March, the 50th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, the Berlin Declaration was adopted by all Member States. This declaration outlined the intention of all Member States {{to agree on a}} new treaty in time for the 2009 Parliamentary elections, that is to have a ratified treaty before mid-2009.|$|E
500|$|Sykes is {{wounded by}} Deke's posse while {{securing}} spare horses. The rest of Pike's gang returns to Agua Verde for shelter, where a bacchanal celebrating the weapons transfer has commenced; they see Angel [...] being dragged {{on the ground}} by a rope tied behind the general's car. After a brief frolic with prostitutes and a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>reflection,</b> Pike and the gang try to forcibly persuade Mapache to release Angel, who by then was barely alive after the torture. The general appears to comply; however, as they watch, the general instead cuts Angel's throat. Pike and Engstrom angrily gun Mapache {{down in front of}} his men. For a moment, the federales are so shocked that they fail to return fire, causing Engstrom to laugh in surprise. Pike calmly takes aim at Mohr and kills him, too. This results in a violent, bloody shootout—dominated by the machine gun—in which Pike and his men are killed, along with most of Mapache's present troops and the remaining German adviser.|$|E
50|$|Those {{who feel}} called to this {{ministry}} undergo a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> prayerful <b>reflection,</b> discussion, and formation {{under the guidance}} of one of the Society’s priests and, preferably, with others of the same disposition. They also participate in the ecclesial team training program.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditions of}} monasticism within Buddhism require celibacy. Several cultures, however, have revised this {{and now have}} forms of married lay teachers, who are {{distinct}} from the celibate clergy. Moreover, in the countries of Southeast Asia practicing Theravada Buddhism, a tradition exists of young men becoming ordained as monks for brief periods (typically a few weeks and generally {{no more than a}} year) upon completing education, but then leaving monastic life, and continuing to return to the monastery for short <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>reflection</b> even after marriage (if the wife consents). Many Japanese monks and priests were celibate up to the time of the Meiji Restoration.|$|R
40|$|The Act {{requires}} Georgia {{public school}} teachers to conduct a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> quiet <b>reflection</b> not to exceed sixty seconds {{at the start of}} each school day. The moment <b>of</b> quiet <b>reflection</b> is not to be conducted as a religious service. The Act is not to be interpreted as precluding student-initiated voluntary prayers at schools or school-related events...|$|R
2500|$|For {{those who}} join an RCIA process it is a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>reflection,</b> prayer, instruction, discernment, and formation. There is no set {{timetable}} {{and those who}} join the process are encouraged to go at their own pace, taking {{as much time as}} they need. [...] Although the average process generally takes between eight and twelve months, it can take up to two or more years for some individuals. [...] Those who enter the process are expected to begin attending Mass on a Sunday, attend a weekly RCIA session, and to become increasingly involved in the activities of their local parish.|$|E
2500|$|Referee Dougie McDonald {{announced}} his early retirement {{with immediate effect}} after the strike weekend, in order to remove the issue of his disputed actions which in part led to the strike, from the ongoing debate about referees treatment. A statement from the referees after the strike said, [...] "Dougie retiring caps a sad time for Scottish refereeing. We hope the right people can sit down with referees and play a full part in delivering the real changes required." [...] adding that they hoped the strike had [...] "allowed everyone connected with Scottish football to have the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>reflection</b> we felt was needed". Although Celtic made no official comment, Paul McBride, a QC {{closely linked to the}} Celtic board of directors, commented that the club felt vindicated by the departures of Dallas and McDonald.|$|E
2500|$|After {{numerous}} experiments, Munch {{concluded that}} the Impressionist idiom did not allow sufficient expression. He found it superficial and too akin to scientific experimentation. He felt a need to go deeper and explore situations brimming with emotional content and expressive energy. Under Jæger's commandment that Munch should [...] "write his life", meaning that Munch should explore his own emotional and psychological state, the young artist began a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>reflection</b> and self-examination, recording his thoughts in his [...] "soul's diary". This deeper perspective helped move him to a new view of his art. He wrote that his painting The Sick Child (1886), based on his sister's death, was his first [...] "soul painting", his first break from Impressionism. The painting received a negative response from critics and from his family, and caused another [...] "violent outburst of moral indignation" [...] from the community.|$|E
5000|$|In 1984, Cardinal was {{appointed}} by the chiefs of Treaty 8 to negotiate an agreement to [...] "renovate" [...] that treaty. The failure of the negotiations after a promising beginning caused Cardinal to undertake a lengthy <b>period</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>reflection,</b> including much study with elders.|$|R

5|$|Unhalfbricking appeared, therefore, at a {{difficult}} time for the group, but was enthusiastically received.

"'It seems incredible,' he said, after a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>reflection.</b> 'I suppose I {{must have}} mistaken another man for Barting, and that man's cold {{greeting}} {{was merely a}} stranger's civil acknowledgment of my own. I remember, indeed, that he lacked Barting's mustache.' ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{so he went}} on scolding to his den beneath, {{taking the}} candle with him; and I {{remained}} in the dark. The <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>reflection</b> succeeding this silly action compelled me to admit the necessity of smothering my pride and choking my wrath, and bestirring myself to remove its effects. An unexpected aid presently appeared {{in the shape of}} Throttler, whom I now recognised as a son of our old Skulker: it had spent its whelphood at the Grange, and was given by my father to Mr. Hindley. I fancy it knew me: it pushed its nose against mine by way of salute, and then hastened to devour the porridge; while I groped from step to step, collecting the shattered earthenware, and drying the spatters of milk from the banister with my pocket-handkerchief. Our labours were scarcely over when I heard Earnshaw's tread in the passage; my assistant tucked in his tail, and pressed to the wall; I stole into the nearest doorway. The dog's endeavour to avoid him was unsuccessful; as I guessed by a scutter down-stairs, and a prolonged, piteous yelping. I had better luck: he passed on, entered his chamber, and shut the door. Directly after Joseph came up with Hareton, to put him to bed. I had found shelter in Hareton's room, and the old man, on seeing me, said,--'They's rahm for boath ye un' yer pride, now, I sud think i' the hahse. It's empty; ye may hev' it all to yerseln, un' Him as allus maks a third, i' sich ill company!' ...|$|E

40|$|The University of Tasmania's {{biennial}} timber workshop provides {{opportunity for}} collaborative experimentation through building. Each summer students gather {{for a few}} days to participate in another of Ian Clayton's and Robin Green's forays into timber engineering. For the duration of the workshop chaos appears to reign as nigh-on-impossible feats with timber are tested. And then another two years pass; a time during which Clayton and Green iterate another brief for the next timber workshop. And the experiment begins again. The contrast between the high-energy of the workshops and the apparent quiet of the month between the sharp bursts of experimentation and knowledge-building that the workshops bring and the long <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>reflection</b> which allow the collaborators to finely tune their understandings of both timber engineering and teaching...|$|R
5000|$|In Commonwealth Remembrance Day and Remembrance Sunday services, [...] "The Last Post" [...] {{begins the}} <b>period</b> <b>of</b> silent <b>reflection,</b> and [...] "Reveille" [...] ends it.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a pedagogical methodology for training of quality managers by employment of Activity Based Training (ABT) and Student Response System (SRS). The recent developments and results obtained during pilot testing of the new pedagogical models and services are presented. It is demonstrated the professional training by means of ABT learning environment, employing a generalised quality assurance process in an organization. It makes training experiential allowing for <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>reflection.</b> Trainees’ outcomes are evaluated with SRS that are an integrated component of the course. The research results and practical issues deduced from the implementation phase demonstrate the quality of feedback from trainees, the effectiveness of the different discussion methods, some logistical considerations, timed versus non-timed voting sessions, the instructor's role in explaining the alternatives of a quiz and the main problems that may become drawbacks of the evaluation system...|$|R

40|$|This article {{reports on}} {{the first year of}} a {{collaborative}} effort between the instrumental methods students at Illinois State University and the beginning band and string program at Metcalf Laboratory School in Normal, Illinois, U. S. A. The curriculum of the University’s methods course and the practices of the band and string program at Metcalf were aligned to allow preservice teachers from the university to work alongside the instrumental staff at Metcalf. The pedagogy learned in the methods classroom was put into practice. The university students benefited from 1) extended teaching time with the Metcalf students, (2) regular demonstration and feedback from both the university and Metcalf supervisor, (3) opportunities for peer evaluation, and (4) planned <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>reflection.</b> The instrumental students at Metcalf achieved higher levels of proficiency on their instruments and progressed faster due to the increase in individual attention...|$|R

50|$|During this time, Meninger {{came across}} a work by an English hermit of the 14th century, called the Cloud of Unknowing. It was written to help people living regular lives in the world develop and deepen their prayer lives. He found that it taught contemplative prayer in a simple way {{available}} to anyone. He began to teach this method to the younger monks of the abbey and to the retreatants {{who had come to}} it for a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> spiritual <b>reflection.</b>|$|R

Rydall would later publish a book titled Emergence in which he detailed the Law in further detail.|$|R
