5|$|Following {{his term}} in the Senate, Beckham resumed his legal {{practice}} in Louisville. He sought another term as governor in 1927. This time he {{had the support of}} the Louisville Courier-Journal, which had been purchased by his ally, Robert W. Bingham. He was opposed by a <b>powerful</b> <b>political</b> machine known as the Jockey Club, whose main interest was securing legislation to allow parimutuel betting at the state's horse racetracks.|$|E

5|$|The abrupt {{abolition}} of slavery which Rio Branco had warned against eventually occurred eight years later. This {{resulted in the}} alienation of the second Viscount of Uruguai's ultraconservative faction and <b>powerful</b> <b>political</b> interests. These formed a subversive alliance with republicans and discontented military officers {{which led to the}} overthrow of the Empire on 15 November 1889.|$|E
5|$|Ireland {{continued}} as {{a patchwork of}} rival kingdoms but, beginning in the 7th century, a concept of national kingship gradually became articulated through {{the concept of a}} High King of Ireland. Medieval Irish literature portrays an almost unbroken sequence of High Kings stretching back thousands of years but modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the 8th century to justify the status of <b>powerful</b> <b>political</b> groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past.|$|E
5|$|Jim Foster, {{then the}} most <b>powerful</b> <b>political</b> {{organizer}} in San Francisco, went to Miami to assist gay activists there as election day neared, and a nationwide boycott {{of orange juice}} was organized.

5|$|Mary and Louis fell in {{love when}} they were reunited in Buda. At first, Queen Mary had no {{influence}} over politics of Hungary and Bohemia because of her youth. Her court was replete with Germans and Dutch, who formed a base for {{the interests of the}} House of Habsburg. By 1524 Mary negotiated significant authority and influence for herself. In 1525, she took control over one <b>powerful</b> <b>political</b> faction and neutralised another. Austria's ambassador, Andrea de Borgo, was appointed by the Queen herself.|$|E
5|$|Sejanus {{was born}} in 20 BC at Volsinii, Etruria, into the family of Lucius Seius Strabo. The Seii were Romans of the equestrian class (or knights), the lower of the two upper social classes of the Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire. Sejanus' {{grandfather}} maintained relations with senatorial families through his marriage with Terentia, a sister of the wife of Gaius Maecenas, {{who was one of}} Emperor Augustus' most <b>powerful</b> <b>political</b> allies.|$|E

5|$|The {{reforms of}} Sejanus most {{significantly}} included {{the founding of}} the Castra Praetoria, which established the Praetorian Guard as the <b>powerful</b> <b>political</b> force, for which it is primarily known today. Henceforth the Guard was at the disposal of the emperors, and the rulers were equally {{at the mercy of the}} Praetorians. The reality of this was seen in AD 31, when Tiberius was forced to rely upon the vigiles against the soldiers of his own guard. Although the Praetorian Guard proved faithful to the aging Tiberius, their potential political power had been made clear.|$|E
5|$|While Octavian {{acted as}} consul in Rome, he {{dispatched}} senators to the provinces {{under his command}} as his representatives to manage provincial affairs and ensure that his orders were carried out. The provinces not under Octavian's control were overseen by governors chosen by the Roman Senate. Octavian became the most <b>powerful</b> <b>political</b> figure {{in the city of}} Rome and in most of its provinces, but he did not have sole monopoly on political and martial power.|$|E
5|$|After {{he became}} Emperor, Zara Yaqob married princess Eleni, who had {{converted}} from Islam before their marriage. Eleni {{was the daughter}} of the king of Hadiya, one of the Sidamo kingdoms south of the Abay River. Although she failed to bear him any children, Eleni grew into a <b>powerful</b> <b>political</b> person. When a conspiracy involving one of his Bitwodeds came to light, Zara Yaqob reacted by appointing his two daughters, Medhan Zamada and Berhan Zamada, to these two offices. According to the Chronicle of his reign, the Emperor also appointed his daughters and nieces as governors over eight of his provinces. These appointments were not successful.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} the urge to {{identify}} scapegoats for the fire is {{the acceptance of the}} confession of a simple-minded French watchmaker named Robert Hubert, who claimed that he was an agent of the Pope and had started the Great Fire in Westminster. He later changed his story to say that he had started the fire at the bakery in Pudding Lane. Hubert was convicted, despite some misgivings about his fitness to plead, and hanged at Tyburn on 28 September 1666. After his death, it became apparent that he had been on board a ship in the North Sea, and had not arrived in London until two days after the fire started. These allegations that Catholics had started the fire were exploited as <b>powerful</b> <b>political</b> propaganda by opponents of pro-Catholic Charles II's court, mostly during the Popish Plot and the exclusion crisis later in his reign.|$|E
5|$|Even out {{of elected}} office, he was widely {{considered}} the most <b>powerful</b> <b>political</b> figure in the state for many years. His influence extended {{all over the state}} and the nation. As a member of the Oregon Health & Science University board, Goldschmidt was an early advocate of the controversial Portland Aerial Tram, which connected the research hospital to real estate projects by his longtime associates Homer Williams and Irving Levin near land whose owners Goldschmidt later represented. He stayed active in Portland as well, advocating an expansion of the Park Blocks (a strip of open park space cutting through downtown Portland.) Goldschmidt assisted in the deal that led to the construction of TriMet's MAX Red Line to Portland International Airport that opened in 2001. He also started the Start Making a Reader Today (SMART) volunteer program in Oregon schools.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} term in the legislature, which met in the state capital of Nashville, Johnson did not {{consistently}} vote with either the Democratic or the newly formed Whig Party, though he revered President Andrew Jackson, a Democrat and Tennessean. The major parties were still determining their core values and policy proposals, with the party system {{in a state of}} flux. The Whig Party had organized in opposition to Jackson, fearing the concentration of power in the Executive Branch of the government; Johnson differed from the Whigs as he opposed more than minimal government spending and spoke against aid for the railroads, while his constituents hoped for improvements in transportation. After Brookins Campbell and the Whigs defeated Johnson for re-election in 1837, Johnson would not lose another race for thirty years. In 1839, he sought to regain his seat, initially as a Whig, but when another candidate sought the Whig nomination, he ran as a Democrat and was elected. From that time he supported the Democratic party and built a <b>powerful</b> <b>political</b> machine in Greene County. Johnson became a strong advocate of the Democratic Party, noted for his oratory, and in an era when public speaking both informed the public and entertained it, people flocked to hear him.|$|E

5|$|Inheriting an Empire on {{the verge}} of disintegration, PedroII turned Portuguese-speaking Brazil into an {{emerging}} power in the international arena. The nation grew to be distinguished from its Hispanic neighbors on account of its political stability, zealously guarded freedom of speech, respect for civil rights, vibrant economic growth and especially for its form of government: a functional, representative parliamentary monarchy. Brazil was also victorious in three international conflicts (the Platine War, the Uruguayan War and the Paraguayan War) under his rule, as well as prevailing in several other international disputes and domestic tensions. PedroII steadfastly pushed through the abolition of slavery despite opposition from <b>powerful</b> <b>political</b> and economic interests. A savant in his own right, the Emperor established a reputation as a vigorous sponsor of learning, culture and the sciences. He won the respect and admiration of scholars such as Charles Darwin, Victor Hugo and Friedrich Nietzsche, and was a friend to Richard Wagner, Louis Pasteur and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, among others.|$|E
5|$|Although the CCC {{became a}} <b>powerful</b> <b>political</b> {{force in the}} {{following}} years, at the 8th National Congress in 1956 its inspectors were warned about abusing their power and becoming independent of their local party committees. Its power waned during the Great Leap Forward, but the CCC, the Secretariat and the Organisation Department became the chief weapons {{in the aftermath of}} the Great Leap to combat corruption and reverse verdicts on rightists. The CCC played its new role until the Cultural Revolution, a socio-political movement which lasted from 1966 until 1976, when it was affected by purges (partly due to its close ties to Peng Zhen, one of the first highly ranked officials purged during the Cultural Revolution). At the 9th National Congress in 1969 the CCC was abolished, removed from the party constitution and replaced by special-case organisations (such as the Central Case Examination Group) formed under Mao and Kang Sheng. Despite its abolition at the congress, little criticism was directed at the CCC during the Cultural Revolution; although CCC Deputy Secretary Min Yifan was criticised by the Red Guards, a revolutionary youth movement independent of the party (but inspired by Mao) during the Cultural Revolution, most of their disapproval focused on his career on local committees rather than the CCC. Talk of an internal party-control system would not resurface until the death of Mao and the arrest of the Gang of Four in 1976.|$|E
