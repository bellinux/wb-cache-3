40|$|The {{spectrum}} of congenital eye malformations including microphthalmia (small eyes), anophthalmia (absent eyes) and coloboma (ventral eye defects), or MAC, causes blindness in approximately 1 in 10, 000 children. We have discovered novel RBP 4 coding and SOX 3 regulatory mutations {{in patients with}} MAC disease. RBP 4 encodes plasma retinol binding protein, a lipocalin that transports vitamin A, an essential nutrient for eye development, in the bloodstream. We show RBP 4 missense mutations p. A 73 T and p. A 75 T alter the ligand-binding pocket, causing autosomal dominant MAC with reduced penetrance and a maternal parent-of-origin effect. Both mutant alleles encode dominant-negative RBPs that bind poorly to vitamin A but strongly to the STRA 6 receptor on recipient cell membranes. Consequently, a vitamin A “bottleneck” is created at the maternal-fetal interface, {{which is likely to}} reduce vitamin A delivery to the fetus, particularly when the mutation is inherited from the mother. This is the first report of such a defective interfering allele for a blood cargo protein in human disease. In a separate case, we describe a novel SOX 3 regulatory mutation in a 46,XX child with bilateral anophthalmia and SRY-negative female-to-male sex reversal. In this patient, a paternal de novo 9 q 21 Xq 27 insertional translocation has juxtaposed TRPM 3 exons 1 and 2 downstream from SOX 3, at the midpoint of a 180 -bp <b>pallindrome.</b> This implicates a dominant, gain-of-function mechanism whereby ectopic SOX 3 transcription disrupts early eye and gonadal development. Transgenic mouse models test this hypothesis and reveal sensitivity of the developing eye to alterations in SoxB 1 (Sox 2) spatiotemporal activity. This thesis highlights genetic and environmental factors that influence eye development, and it has broad implications for other congenital disorders...|$|E
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{sequence of the}} envelope gene and the adjacent 3 ′ long terminal repeat (LTR) of Gardner-Arnstein feline leukemia virus of subgroup B (GA-FeLV-B) has been determined. Comparison of the derived amino acid sequence of the gp 70 -p 15 E polyprotein to those of several previously reported murine retroviruses revealed striking homologies between GA-FeLV-B gp 70 and the gp 70 of a Moloney virus-derived mink cell focus-forming virus. These homologies were located within the substituted (presumably xenotropic) portion of the mink cell focus-forming virus envelope gene and comprised amino acid sequences not present in three ecotropic virus gp 70 s. In addition, areas of insertions and deletions, in general, were the same between GA-FeLV-B and Moloney mink cell focus-forming virus, although the sizes of the insertions and deletions differed. Homologies between GA-FeLV-B and mink cell focus-forming virus gp 70 s is functionally significant in that they both possess expanded host ranges, a property dictated by gp 70. The amino acid sequence of FeLV-B contains 12 Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequences, indicating 12 possible sites of N-linked glycosylation as compared with 7 or 8 for its murine counterparts. Comparison of the 3 ′ LTR of GA-FeLV-B to AKR and Moloney virus LTRs revealed extensive conservation in several regions including the “CCAAT” and Goldberg-Hogness (TATA) boxes thought {{to be involved in}} promotion of transcription and in the repeat region of the LTR. The inverted repeats that flanked the LTR of GA-FeLV-B were identical to the murine inverted repeats, but were one base longer than the latter. The region of U 3 corresponding to the approximately 75 -nucleotide “enhancer sequence” is present in GA-FeLV-B, but contains deletions relative to AKR and Moloney virus and is not repeated. An interesting <b>pallindrome</b> in the repeat region immediately 3 ′ to the U 3 region was noted in all the LTRs, but was particularly pronounced in GA-FeLV-B. Possible roles for this structure are discussed...|$|E
