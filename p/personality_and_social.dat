5|$|In a study {{published}} in 1979 in Advances in the Study of Affect, vol. 5, and in another article using the same data and published in 1980 in the Journal of <b>Personality</b> <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> Psychology, Michael D. Storms of the University of Kansas outlined his own reimagining of the Kinsey scale. Whereas Kinsey measured sexual orientation based on a combination of actual sexual behavior and fantasizing and eroticism, Storms used only fantasizing and eroticism. Storms, however, placed hetero-eroticism and homo-eroticism on separate axes rather than at two ends of a single scale; this allows for a distinction between bisexuality (exhibiting both hetero- and homo-eroticism in degrees comparable to hetero- or homosexuals, respectively) and asexuality (exhibiting a level of homo-eroticism comparable to a heterosexual and a level of hetero-eroticism comparable to a homosexual, namely, little to none). This type of scale accounted for asexuality for the first time. Storms conjectured that many researchers following Kinsey's model could be mis-categorizing asexual subjects as bisexual, because both were simply defined by a lack of preference for gender in sexual partners.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{shows that}} <b>personality</b> traits <b>and</b> <b>social</b> {{relationships}} are deeply entwined in a bidirectional way: Individuals select relationships partly {{based on their}} personality traits {{but at the same}} time develop across the lifespan partly in response to changes in their social environment. Life transitions are an important catalyst of changes in personality-relationship transactions. We argue that <b>personality</b> traits <b>and</b> <b>social</b> relationships are so closely tied that, in our view, the link between <b>personality</b> <b>and</b> health can only be understood against the backdrop of individuals’ relationships...|$|R

The results showed that there is significant correlation between marital dissatisfaction with neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, <b>and</b> immaturity in <b>social</b> relations.
