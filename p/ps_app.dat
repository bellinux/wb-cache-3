40|$|International audienceWiFi P 2 <b>P</b> allows mobile <b>apps</b> {{to connect}} to each other via WiFi without an {{intermediate}} access point. This communication mode is widely used by mobile apps to support interactions {{with one or more}} devices simultaneously. However, testing such <b>P</b> 2 <b>P</b> <b>apps</b> remains a challenge for app developers as i) existing testing frameworks lack support for WiFi P 2 P, and ii) WiFi P 2 P testing fails to scale when considering a deployment on more than two devices. In this paper, we therefore propose an acceptance testing framework, named AndroFleet, to automate testing of WiFi P 2 <b>P</b> mobile <b>apps</b> at scale. Beyond the capability of testing point-to-point interactions under various conditions, AndroFleet supports the deployment and the emulation of a fleet of mobile devices as part of an alpha testing phase in order to assess the robustness of a WiFi <b>P</b> 2 <b>P</b> <b>app</b> once deployed in the field. To validate AndroFleet, we demonstrate the detection of failing black-box acceptance tests for WiFi <b>P</b> 2 <b>P</b> <b>apps</b> and we capture the conditions under which such a mobile app can correctly work in the field.

40|$|An {{electrochemical}} sensor for p-aminophenyl phosphate (<b>p</b> <b>APP)</b> is reported. It {{is based on}} the electrochemical conversion of 4 -aminophenol (4 AP) at a quantum dot (QD) modified electrode under illumination. Without illumination no electron transfer and thus no oxidation of 4 AP can occur. <b>p</b> <b>APP</b> as substrate is converted by the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (ALP) to generate 4 AP as a product. The QDs are coupled via 1, 4 -benzenedithiol (BDT) linkage to the surface of a gold electrode and thus allow potential-controlled photocurrent generation. The photocurrent is modified by the enzyme reaction providing access to the substrate detection. In order to develop a photobio{{electrochemical sensor}} the enzyme is immobilized on top of the photo-switchable layer of the QDs. Immobilization of ALP is required for the potential possibility of spatially resolved measurements. Geometries with immobilized ALP are compared versus having the ALP in solution. Data indicate that functional immobilization with layer-by-layer assembly is possible.

The passage of the peptides across the epithelial cellmonolayers is shown to be primarily paracellular, with an inverse dependenceon molecular size, and an enhanced flux observed for cationic peptides.

The aim of present study was to investigate whether cimetidine affects the transport of various quinolone antibiotics in human col-orectal cancer cell line (Caco- 2) system which has been typically used to investigate drug transport via P-gp. The apparent permeability coefficients (<b>P</b> <b>app)</b> value of 9 quinolone antibiotics in the co-treatment with cimetidine was examined. Apical to basolateral (AP-to-BL) transport of fleroxacin in the co-treatment with cimetidine was increased to 1. 5 -fold (p< 0. 01) compared with that of fleroxacin alone, whereas basolateral to apical (BL-to-AP) transport of fleroxacin was decreased to 0. 83 -fold significantly (p< 0. 05). Ofloxacin was decreased to 0. 8 -fold (p< 0. 01) and 0. 72 -fold (p< 0. 01) significantly in AP-to-BL and BL-to-AP direction, respectively by cimetidine co-treatment. The <b>P</b> <b>app</b> values of gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin and rufloxacin also were changed by cime-tidine. These results have a potential that cimetidine influences on the pharmacokinetics of quinolone antibiotics.

40|$|Abstract Background The rhizome of Zingiber cassumunar and {{the seed}} of Nigella sativa are two {{ingredients}} in Thai traditional medicine to relieve dysmenorrhea and adjust the menstrual cycle. Mixture of these two herbs produces three esters, namely (E) - 4 -(3, 4 -dimethoxyphenyl) but- 3 -en- 1 -yl linoleate (1), (E) - 4 -(3, 4 -dimethoxyphenyl) but- 3 -en- 1 -yl oleate (2) and (E) - 4 -(3, 4 -dimethoxyphenyl) but- 3 -en- 1 -yl palmitate (3). The {{aim of this study}} is to examine in vitro absorption of these esters and evaluate their transport across the membrane. Methods In vitro transport of these three esters was observed in Caco- 2 cell monolayers. The ester compounds 1, 2 and 3 at a concentration of 10 μM were hydrolyzed by porcine liver esterase. Results All esters transported across the Caco- 2 cell without enzymatic hydrolysis. The apparent permeability coefficients <b>P</b> <b>app</b> of compound 1 at 53 μM and 106 μM were 13. 94 (0. 60) × 10 - 6 and 14. 33 (0. 17) × 10 - 6 cm/s respectively, while those of compound 2 were 9. 45 (0. 29) × 10 - 6 and 10. 08 (0. 32) × 10 - 6 cm/s, respectively. <b>P</b> <b>app</b> values of compound 3 were 7. 48 (0. 31) × 10 - 6 cm/s at 53 μM and 8. 60 (0. 55) × 10 - 6 cm/s at 106 μM. <b>P</b> <b>app</b> values of the parent compound (compound D), i. e. (E) - 4 -(3, 4 -dimethoxyphenyl) but- 3 -en- 1 -ol were 8. 53 (0. 83) × 10 - 6 cm/s at 53 μM and 16. 38 (0. 61) × 10 - 6 cm/s at 106 μM. The ester hydrolysis of compounds 1, 2 and 3 by porcine liver esterase was monitored by HPLC and the hydrolysis reactions were completed within 10 minutes. Conclusion Using the Caco- 2 cell monolayer model, the present study finds that compounds (E) - 4 -(3, 4 -dimethoxyphenyl) but- 3 -en- 1 -yl linoleate (1), (E) - 4 -(3, 4 -dimethoxyphenyl) but- 3 -en- 1 -yl oleate (2) and (E) - 4 -(3, 4 -dimethoxyphenyl) but- 3 -en- 1 -yl palmitate (3) originated from Prasaplai preparation (a Thai herbal formula) may be transported through a facilitated mechanism and serve as pro-drugs to increase the compound D level in the blood. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the present}} study was to {{identify}} a model for the blood-brain barrier based on the use of a continuous cell line, and to investigate the specificity of this model. A set of test compounds, reflecting different transport mechanisms and different degrees of permeability, as well as different physiochemical properties was selected. In vivo data for transport across the blood-brain barrier of this set of test compounds was generated as part of the study using two different in vivo models. A computational prediction model was also developed, based on 74 proprietary Pharmacia compounds, previously tested in one of the in vivo models. Molsurf descriptors were calculated and 21 descriptors were correlated with log(Brain conc. /Plasma conc.) using partial least squares projection to latent structures (PLS). However, the correlation between predicted and measured values was found to be rather low and differed between one and two log units for several of the compounds. The test compounds were analyzed in vitro using primary bovine and human brain endothelial cells co-cultured with astrocytes, and also using two different immortalized brain endothelial cell lines, one originating from rat and one from mouse. Cell models using cells not derived from the blood–brain barrier, ECV/C 6, MDCK and Caco- 2 cell lines, were also used. No linear correlation between in vivo and in vitro permeability was found for any of the in vitro models when all compounds were included in the analysis. The highest r 2 values were seen in the bovine brain endothelial cells (r 2 = 0. 43) and MDCKwt (r 2 = 0. 46) cell models. Higher correlations were seen when only passively transported compounds were included in the analysis, bovine brain endothelial cells (r 2 = 0. 74), MDCKwt (r 2 = 0. 65) and Caco- 2 (r 2 = 0. 86). By plotting in vivo <b>P</b> <b>app</b> values against logD pH 7. 4 it was possible to classify compounds into four different classes: (1) compounds crossing the blood-brain barrier by passive diffusion, (2) compounds crossing the blood-brain barrier by blood-flow limited passive diffusion, (3) compounds crossing the blood-brain barrier by carrier mediated influx, and (4) compounds being actively excreted from the brain by active efflux. <b>P</b> <b>app</b> and <b>P</b> e values obtained using the different in vitro models were also plotted against logD pH 7. 4 and compared to the plot obtained when in vivo <b>P</b> <b>app</b> values were used. Several of the in vitro models could distinguish between passively distributed compounds and efflux substrates. Of the cell lines included in the present study, the MDCKmdr- 1 cell line gave the best separation of passively and effluxed compounds. Ratios between AUC in brain and AUC in blood were also calculated for six of the compounds and compared to ratios between P e or <b>P</b> <b>app</b> for transport in the apical to basolateral and basolateral to apical direction. Again the MDCKmdr- 1 cell line gave the best correlation with only one compound (AZT) giving large discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo data. None of the in vitro models could identify compounds known to be substrates for carrier mediated influxed as such, and the results indicate that a tighter in vitro blood-brain barrier model probably is needed in order to facilitate studies on carrier mediated influx. The findings presented also indicate that identification of ‘‘batteries'' of in vitro tests are likely to be necessary in order to improve in vitro–in vivo correlations and to make it possible to perform acceptable predictions of in vivo brain distributions from in vitro data...|$|R

30|$|Initial work on {{detection}} of P 2 P botnets involved signature-based and port-based approaches [23]. Solutions such as BotMiner [20] rely on DPI which can easily defeated by bots using encryption. Some {{of the recent}} work has used supervised [24],[25] and unsupervised [26],[27] machine learning approaches and other statistical measures [28]. PeerRush [24] created ‘application profile’ from the network traces of multiple P 2 P applications. Their work utilized payload sizes and inter-packet delays to categorize the exact P 2 P application running on a host. The approach of Zhang et al.

P 2 P bots were identified based on certain features like fingerprint similarity, number of overlapping contacts, persistent communication, etc. However, their work can detect P 2 P bots inside a network only when there are multiple infected nodes belonging to the same botnet.

The main reason behind this flaw was that conversations attempt to provide a bird’s eye view of the network activity to the network administrator but miss out certain finer details: since all flows between two IPs are aggregated into a single conversation, this approach will create a single conversation for two IPs having malicious as well as benign flows between them and thus fail to detect the malicious traffic.

The oral bioavailability of TSB was about 3 % in rats with less proportional increase in its maximum plasma concentration (C max) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) with increasing dosage. The time to C max (T max) was prolonged at higher oral dosage. In a single pass rat intestinal perfusion model, the permeability coefficients (<b>P</b> <b>app)</b> based on TSB disappearance from the lumen (P lumen) were 6. 2 - to 7. 2 -fold higher (p < 0. 01) than those based on drug appearance in mesenteric venous blood (P blood). The uptake and efflux of TSB in Caco- 2 cells were also significantly altered in the presence of an inhibitor for P-glycoprotein (PgP) or for multi-drug resistance associated protein (MRP 1 / 2). TSB transport from the apical (AP) to basolateral (BL) side in Caco- 2 monolayers was 3. 3 - to 5. 7 -fold lower than that from BL to AP side, but this polarized transport was attenuated by co-incubation of PgP or MRP 1 / 2 inhibitors.

Furthermore, TSB significantly inhibited the uptake of digoxin and vinblastine in membrane vesicles containing PgP or MRP 1. TSB also moderately stimulated PgP ATPase activity.
