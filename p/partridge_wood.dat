50|$|Millettia stuhlmannii, {{commonly}} known as panga panga, is a well-known species of timber tree that is native to the southeastern Afrotropics. The alternative name <b>partridge</b> <b>wood</b> refers to the light and dark patterns of its heartwood, which is said to form ‘partridge-breast’ figures. The wood of the tropical species M. laurentii has similar qualities and uses, but is slightly darker, and lacks the copious yellowish white resin of the heartwood vessels. Its foliage {{is similar to that}} of Pterocarpus rotundifolius, and it may be confused with the latter when observed from a distance.|$|E

It is {{the only member of the}} genus Rollulus. This small partridge is a resident breeder in lowland rainforests in south Burma, south Thailand, Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo. Its nest is a ground scrape lined with leaves, which is concealed under a heap of leaf litter. Five or six white eggs are incubated for 18 days.|$|R

Small groups forage in underbrush, secondary growth, near forest clearings and coffee plantations. The species local name is [...] "chir-ras-qua" [...] after its noisy call. It has a chicken-like appearance due to its long tail and legs. Its pale iris and streaked neck differentiates it from other quail like birds.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 430 avian-derived fecal {{specimens}} were randomly collected from selected Western Australian commercial aviaries, poultry farms, hatcheries, wildlife parks, and the Perth Zoo and screened {{for the presence}} of Cryptosporidium by PCR. Of these, 27 Cryptosporidium-positive isolates were detected, characterized, and compared with 11 avian-derived isolates from the Czech Republic at the 18 S rRNA and actin gene loci. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis identified four genetically distinct genotypes, avian genotypes I to IV, from various avian hosts. In addition, the host range for Cryptosporidium galli was extended.

5000|$|... "The local {{word for}} a rocky hill is 'tolt' {{and there is an}} {{interesting}} story surrounding the origin of Hannah's Tolt, located inland from Northern Bay near Welsh's Pond. It occurred probably in the 1920s or 1930s. Late in the fall of the year when a crowd of women were in the woods berry-picking, Hannah Milley and her daughter must have been separated from the main group of women when a snowstorm suddenly broke out. They never made it back to the community. Search parties failed to turn up the bodies, but about 17 years later, a man named Lewis Crummey was in the <b>woods</b> <b>partridge</b> hunting and he found the two bodies and their rusted berry buckets down {{at the base of a}} tolt, which was then nicknamed Hannah's Tolt." ...|$|R
60|$|In these wanderings nothing {{occurred}} to jar my feelings, or {{bring me back}} to the realities of life. There is a repose in our mighty forests that gives full scope to the imagination. Now and then I would hear the distant sound of the woodcutter's ax, or the crash of some tree which he had laid low; but these noises, echoing along the quiet landscape, could easily be wrought by fancy into harmony with its illusions. In general, however, the woody recesses of the neighborhood were peculiarly wild and unfrequented. I could ramble for a whole day, without coming upon any traces of cultivation. The <b>partridge</b> of the <b>wood</b> scarcely seemed to shun my path, and the squirrel, from his nut-tree, would gaze at me for an instant, with sparkling eye, as if wondering at the unwonted intrusion.|$|R
40|$|Diet, prey availability, and {{breeding}} success were studied {{in a population}} of Bonelli's eagle (Hieraaetus fasciatus) {{in the province of}} Granada, SE Spain. The densities of the main prey species, European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), red-legged <b>partridge</b> (Alectoris rufa), <b>wood</b> pigeon (Columba palumbus), and rock dove (Columba livia), representing 90. 2 % of the biomass, were analysed in 19 territories occupied by pairs of Bonelli's eagles and 15 potential territories that were unoccupied but appropriate for nesting. We found no signi®cant di€erences in prey density between the two types of territories. Contrary to other raptor species, we found no signi®cant relationship between the density of their main prey species and the distance of the neighbouring pairs, either between that density {{and breeding}} success. These ®ndings, together with the prior knowledge of nest-site selection of this eagle in the study area, can be used for proper planning of conservation strategies. These should avoid unnecessary e€ort to increase the eagle's food supply, and should promote the reintroduction of individuals to suitable sites for Bonelli's eagle. # 2000 Elsevie...|$|R
50|$|The Phobjika Valley {{has several}} {{vulnerable}} {{species of birds}} in the Protected Conservation Area established in 2003. The most celebrated species of the region is the black-necked crane. The other vulnerable species are the chestnut-breasted <b>partridge</b> (Arborophila mandellii), <b>wood</b> snipe (Gallinago nemoricola), Blyth's tragopan (Tragopan blythii), greater spotted eagle (Aquila clanga), imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), Baer's pochard (Aythya baeri), Hodgson's bushchat (Saxicola insignis), dark-rumped swift (Apus acuticauda), and grey-crowned prinia (Prinia cinereocapilla).The Conservation Area of 163 km2, which includes Gewogs of Phobji, Gangte and Bjena under the Wangdue Phodrang dzongkhag, has been leased out for Conservation Planning and Management to the Royal Society for the Protection of Nature (RSPN), a non-governmental organization (NGO) set up in Bhutan in 1987 (legally incorporated in 1997). RSPN is involved {{not only in the}} conservation management of the black-necked cranes and their habitat but also in conducting research on public education and awareness, community empowerment for conservation, and integrated conservation and development programmes, including community-based ecotourism in the valley. The black-necked cranes arrive in this valley in late October and depart in mid-February.|$|R
60|$|Of the {{feathered}} tribes {{there are}} the large and small grey Canada goose, the laughing goose (so called from the resemblance of its cry to laughter), and the wavie or white goose. The latter are not very numerous. There are great numbers of wild ducks, pintails, widgeons, divers, sawbills, black ducks, and teal; but the prince of ducks (the canvas-back) is not there. In spring and autumn the whole country becomes musical with the wild cries and shrill whistle of immense hosts of plover of all kinds--long legs, short legs, black legs, and yellow legs--sandpipers and snipe, which are assisted in their noisy concerts by myriads of frogs. The latter are really the best songsters in Hudson Bay [see note 2]. Bitterns are {{also found in the}} marshes; and sometimes, though rarely, a solitary crane finds its way to the coast. In the woods, and among the dry places around, there are a few grey grouse and <b>wood</b> <b>partridges,</b> a great many hawks, and owls of all sizes-- from the gigantic white owl, which measures five feet across the back and wings, to the small grey owl, not much bigger than a man's hand.|$|R
60|$|There {{is no need}} {{to follow}} in detail the long journey which Hearne had to take in order to {65} return to the fort. The march lasted nearly a year, during which he was exposed to the same hardship, famine and danger as {{on his way to the}} sea. The route {{followed}} on the return was different. The party ascended the valley of the Coppermine as far as Point Lake, a considerable body of water visited later by Franklin, and distant one hundred and sixty miles from the sea. This was reached on September 3, 1771. Four months were spent in travelling almost directly south. They passed over a rugged country of stone and marsh, buried deep in snow, with here and there a clump of stunted pine or straggling willow. Bitter weather with great gales and deep snow set in in October. Snow-shoes and sledges were made. Many small lakes and rivers, now fast frozen, were traversed, but the whole country is still so little known that Hearne's path can hardly be traced with certainty. By the middle of November the clumps of trees thickened into the northern edge of the great forest. The way now became easier. They had better shelter from the wind, and firewood was abundant. For food the party carried dried meat from Point Lake, and as they passed into the thicker woods they were fortunate enough to find a few rabbits and <b>wood</b> <b>partridges.</b> {66} Some fish were caught through the ice of the river. But in nearly two months of walking only two deer were seen.|$|R
