X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicates the successful formation of ZnO phase. FESEM {{results show that the}} grain size of synthesized samples varies from 60 to 85 nm for pure and doped samples. It is observed that the value of dielectric constant and dielectric loss is maximum for pure ZnO which decreases for doped samples. Polarization versus electric field (P-E) loops of <b>pure</b> <b>ZnO</b> <b>shows</b> loosy capacitor behavior which tends towards non-linear ferroelectric behavior through the doping of Ni, Li and Mg in ZnO. Furthermore, the room temperature magnetization versus magnetic field (M-H) loops indicates the existence of ferromagnetism in pure, Ni, and Mg doped samples. However, Li doped ZnO sample shows an unusual behavior indicating the presence of both ferromagnetic and diamagnetic phases in the sample. The coexistence of both ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism simultaneously in Ni and Mg doped ZnO makes it a possible candidate for multiferroic devices. The coupling between ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism is measured through magnetoelectric (ME) coupling measurements which shows that the average value of second order magnetoelectric coefficient (beta) increases from 5. 23 x 10 (- 6) to 3. 08 x 10 (- 4) cm-Oe(2) for pure to Ni doped ZnO samples, respectively.

30|$|In other element-doping systems, {{different}} {{mechanisms of}} FM have been reported. Hou et al. {{reported that the}} carrier-induced FM (RKKY or double exchange mechanism) might be applied to explain the FM in Cu-doped ZnO films, in which the free carrier concentration is vital {{to determine whether the}} material is PM or FM [33]. Meanwhile, Hu et al. found that Cr ion substitution is necessary for establishing FM in Cr-doped ZnO films containing VZn[34]. However, Ran et al. suggested that defects of Cu-doped ZnO films, such as oxygen vacancies and/or zinc interstitials, might contribute to the RTFM, thus, the observed RTFM was explained in terms of defect-related models [35]. Otherwise, Qi et al. concluded that an exchange mechanism associated with oxygen vacancies was responsible for the FM in the Zn 1 -xErxO thin films [23]. At the same time, the RTFM was clearly observed in In-doped ZnO nanowires, which may be associated with oxygen vacancies induced by In doping [36]. In our system, the <b>pure</b> <b>ZnO</b> NPs <b>show</b> the PM behavior, but all of the other doping samples exhibit the clear RTFM, so it's sure that the RTFM is induced by doping of Zr. In the XRD patterns, all the intense peaks from Zn 1 -xZrxO (x = 0.005, 0.01, 0.015, 0.02) could be indexed the same hexagonal wurtzite structure as <b>pure</b> <b>ZnO</b> NPs, the increase in a and c parameter as a function of Zr concentration is consistent with the substitution of Zn 2 + ions (0.74 Å) by Zr 4 + ions (0.84 Å) [25, 26]. The more Zn 2 + were substituted by Zr 4 +, the greater lattice distortion of ZnO would be generated, the more vacancies and/or interstitials should be got. After measured the Raman and XPS, our supposition has been affirmed that there are lots of oxygen vacancies in our samples. As a result, oxygen vacancies should be considered as the origin of FM in our samples, which seems to be similar to the series of Er [23], In [36]-doped ZnO, where the oxygen vacancies also {{play a crucial role in}} the RTFM.|$|R

Finally, fitting the magnetization curves shows that the approach to saturation follows a 1 /H dependence, suggesting the governance of defects rather than magnetocrystalline anisotropy. N/...|$|R
30|$|ZnO {{nanorods}} and ZnO@CdS heterostructures {{have been}} fabricated on carbon fiber cloth substrates via hydrothermal and electrochemical deposition. Their photocatalytic properties were investigated {{by measuring the}} degradation of methylene blue under ultraviolet light irradiation. The result illustrated that the photodegradation efficiency of ZnO@CdS heterostructures was better than that of <b>pure</b> <b>ZnO</b> nanorods, in which the rate constants were about 0.04629 and 0.02617  min− 1. Furthermore, the photocurrent of ZnO@CdS heterostructures achieved 102 times enhancement than <b>pure</b> <b>ZnO</b> nanorods, indicating that more free carriers could be generated and transferred in ZnO@CdS heterostructures, which could {{be responsible for the}} increased photocatalytic performance.|$|R
