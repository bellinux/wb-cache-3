50|$|Although the Spanish chain Antena 3 was {{the first}} {{interested}} in adapting a project {{on the history of}} children stolen in Spain, while later the media group Mediaset Spain Communication, announced {{that he was trying to}} produce their own version of the facts to its main channel, Telecinco, under the <b>provisional</b> <b>mark</b> Stolen Children. The chain Grupo Planeta started at the end of March 2011 its project called Stories stolen and he told the story of twin brothers who were separated at birth. However, the miniseries where Mediaset was working in mid-June 2012, would have the drama that these families lived in the 70s since lost their babies to the current date. Both productions had two episodes for broadcast , and although Telecinco series set to release his first rival chain, Antena 3, it did it first. Atresmedia Televisión aired during the month of September 2012, while that of Mediaset did a year later, in mid- October 2013, ceded an area of discussion focused on the case of the stolen children with Telecinco reports and real testimonials. The telefilm also has a program with real cases called Stolen Children, where are they??, and it is presented by the journalist Jordi Gonzalez.|$|R

25|$|While many Provisional IRA {{volunteers were}} {{reportedly}} {{unhappy with the}} end of armed struggle short of the achievement of a united Ireland, the peace strategy has since resulted in substantial electoral and political gains for Sinn Féin, the movement's political wing. It may now be argued that the Sinn Féin political party has eclipsed the Provisional IRA as {{the most important part of}} the republican movement. The ceasefire of 1994 therefore, while not a definitive end to <b>Provisional</b> IRA operations, <b>marked</b> the effective end of its full scale armed campaign.|$|R
2500|$|According to author Tony Geraghty, British {{authorities}} learnt of {{the first}} horizontal mortar produced by the <b>Provisional</b> IRA, the <b>Mark</b> 12, in 1985. The weapon was recovered after an incident in which three IRA volunteers were killed by security forces. The launcher suffered from the limitation of a heavy recoil, which made {{the handling of the}} device difficult. One British intelligence report say that while the launcher was quite crude, the grenade was made of “a number of components which require a high standard of machine manufacturing.” [...] The projectile had a warhead of 40 ounces (1.1kg) of semtex and TNT. It was used basically as a standoff weapon, in which the grenade was lofted over the security bases’ fences or against armoured vehicles. [...] The mortar had an effective range of 70 yards, within which it could pierce an armour plate or destroy a sangar.|$|R
