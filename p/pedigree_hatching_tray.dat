The farm consisted of sheds containing <b>hatching</b> <b>trays</b> and sixty-three ponds in nine units of seven ponds each. The water supply to the ponds was from a spring, by means of a borehole five hundred feet deep. In December 1941, some 12,000 fish, including carp and bream, were brought from the lake at Highfields park.

40|$|PIVOTAL {{displacement}} or "turning " is {{a purely}} physical factor, necessary during incubation for the normal develop-ment and hatchability of all domestic fowl embryos. In {{order to provide}} the re-quired stimulus, modern commercial in-cubators are so constructed that the trays of eggs can be tilted {{back and forth through}} a 90 degree arc (i. e., 45 degrees each way from horizontal). It is common procedure to candle the eggs and transfer them to <b>hatching</b> <b>trays</b> on the 18 th day. If shaking agitation could be substi-tuted for conventional turning, several advantages would ensue: (1) eggs could be incubated and hatched in the same tray; (2) labor costs resulting from the 18 -day handling would be eliminated; and (3) incubator space could be utilized more efficiently. There are, however, several experi-mental observations recorded in the literature which counsel against the work-ability of such a scheme. Stiles and Wat-terson (1937) described in rather complete detail the effects of jarring on developing embryos. A 490 gm. weight was dropped a distance of 6 cm. onto a table top upon which the incubator rested. The shocks were delivered at the rate of 15 blows per minute at 15 minute intervals.

40|$|A field level {{study was}} carried out to acquire {{experience}} on seed production of mono-sex tilapia at Reliance aqua farms Ukilbari, Boilor, Trishal, Mymensingh. The duration {{of this study was}} 3 months (01 / 04 / 10 to 30 / 06 / 10). Reliance Aqua Farm is occupied 20 acre area of which 1. 5 acre is hatchery complex and 18. 5 acre pond area. They use 40 hatching jar, 120 <b>hatching</b> <b>tray,</b> 12 cistern and 300 hapa in the hatchery complex for seed production. The size of the breeding hapa is 50 ft× 25 ft× 3 ft and each hapa contain 50 male and 150 female at 1 : 3 (male:female) ratio. A single female can produce 1000 - 1500 eggs/cycle. They use hormone in feed for sex reversal (production of all male tilapia) from the first feeding stage. 17 α –methyl testosterone hormone used at 60 mg/kg feed which is dissolved with 95 % ethanol solution. 150 mg ethanol is used for per kg feed preparation. Mechanical method is used for hormone mixing in this farm, and then the feed are dried under room temperature. Commercial mega feed is used. After sex-reversal, fingerlings are generally nursed to an advanced size before they are stocked into grow-out facilities. This procedure increases survival in the grow-out stage and utilizes growing space more efficiently. Sex-reversed fingerlings are stocked at approximately 20 - 25 fish/m 2 in small ponds and cultured for 45 - 50 days to an average size of 15 - 20 g.

40|$|Eggshell {{conductance}} (G) and incubator ventilation (VENT) were {{hypothesized to}} affect embryo viability {{and growth of}} poults following hatching. Nearly 6, 000 eggs were weighed {{on the day of}} oviposition to determine eggs of like weight but of different G. From the 6, 000 eggs, 4, 000 were selected that were within 2 standard deviations of the mean. The eggs were randomly divided equally between two incubator cabinets. One cabinet operated with a closed VENT and a second operated with it open. At the completion of the 24 th day of development, all eggs were weighed a second time to determine eggshell G. Three groups were formed at that time exhibiting high (Hi), average (Avg) or low (Low) G. The eggs within each group were placed into <b>hatching</b> <b>trays</b> of 100 eggs each and placed into he same incubation cabinet for hatching. Weights were recorded for cardiac, hepatic and intestinal tissues, and blood was collected from each treatment. The tissues were subsequently assayed for energy substrates. Embryo viability was noted and growth was observed up to 6 wk of age. More embryos in eggs of Hi or Avg G survived than did those in Low G eggs, but neonates at 6 wk from Hi G eggs weighed less than those from Avg or Low G eggs. Low G embryos had reduced heart, liver and intestinal weight and function. Embryo thyroid hormone concentrations were elevated in Hi G eggs but suppressed by Low G and Closed VENT. Thus, in the developmental process of the embryonic turkey, G may determine energy balance and maturity of each hatchling and may affect its survival and growth rates following hatching...|$|R

Foram utilizados 7. 224 ovos da linhagem Dekalb, distribuídos de acordo com delineamento {{experimental}} inteiramente casualizado, sendo a altura de bandeja uma covariável. Os tratamentos foram definidos pelas idades das matrizes (32 e 57 semanas de idade) e o período de armazenamento dos ovos (três, cinco e sete dias), totalizando seis tratamentos com 14 repetições. A idade das aves influenciou o peso do ovo. Houve aumento na perda de peso dos ovos das matrizes de 32 e 57 semanas de idade, durante o armazenamento (10, 48 e 14, 16 %, respectivamente) e na transferência (10, 40 e 12, 07 %, respectivamente). Verificou-se maior taxa de eclosão (86, 90 %) em ovos produzidos pelas matrizes novas. Independentemente da idade da matriz, à medida que aumentou o período de armazenamento, houve diminuição na taxa de eclosão dos ovos férteis (86, 06 e 82, 39 %, para as matrizes de 32 e 57 semanas de idade, respectivamente).

40|$|The {{relationships}} between age of hens, number of laid eggs, egg weight {{on one hand}} and fertility and hatchability on the other were analysed during two periods of individual <b>pedigree</b> <b>hatching.</b> Altogether 1 369 hens originated from 9 selected initial laying lines of Bar Plymouth Rock (BPR) (3 lines), Rhode Island Red (RIR) (4 lines), Rhode Island White (RIW), and Sussex Light (SUL) breeds. A total number of 23 473 eggs from hens of all 9 aforementioned lines were set after being artificially inseminated. The total average hatchability of set eggs was 73. 2 % and the average percentage of unfertilised eggs was 9. 3 %. Positive correlations (r p = 0. 22 to r p = 0. 72; P < 0. 01) were found between the total number of eggs laid till the 240 th day of age and the number of eggs produced {{at the beginning of the}} laying period in the all studied lines. There were negative correlations (r p =− 0. 03 to r p =− 0. 16; P < 0. 01) between the total number of eggs laid till the 240 th day of age and the average egg weight (on the 222 nd day of age). Zero to positive correlations existed between the total number of eggs laid till the 240 th day of age {{on one hand and}} the number of hatching eggs, number of hatched chicks/hen and hatchability; the calculated values ranged from r p =− 0. 02 to r p = 0. 30 (P< 0. 01), from r p = − 0. 08 to r p = 0. 36 (P p =− 0. 09 to r p = 0. 30 (P< 0. 01), respectively. Correlations between the egg weight and number of hatched chicks/hen were negative to zero and their values ranged from r p =− 0. 19 (P p = 0. 02. Correlations between the egg weight and hatchability were always negative (r p =− 0. 15; P p =− 0. 04). Regarding the fact that there is a concurrent selection for an increased egg weight it can be said that this preference of smaller eggs is really counter-productive. A positive relationship between the number of hatching eggs/hen and the hatchability (r p =− 0. 02 to r p = 0. 39; P < 0. 01) was influenced by calculated negative correlations existing between the weight of eggs and the hatchability as well as between the weight of eggs and the number of laid eggs. As far as the hatchability is concerned, it can be concluded that in the aforementioned laying lines those hens are preferred, which produce more eggs of smaller size and that this fact obviously influences also the efficiency of selection for a greater weight of produced eggs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The chicks {{used in this}} {{experiment}} were obtained from a population of naked neck broiler chickens that has been kept in NAPRI since 1998. Six Hundred chicks were obtained from four hatches, one week apart. At <b>hatch,</b> <b>pedigreed</b> chicks were wing-banded and housed on deep litter in an open house. Body weights were measured biweekly up to 8 weeks of age. Other measurements taken include Neck length, Back length, keel length and breast angle.

30|$|In this study, 10 {{chickens}} from a paternal broiler line (TT) {{developed by}} the EMBRAPA Poultry Breeding Program were used for SNP discovery. This line has been under multi-trait selection since 1992, with emphasis to improve body weight, feed conversion, carcass and cuts yield, viability, fertility and hatchability. The association analyses were performed in an experimental broiler population, called TT Reference Population. This population was generated for genomic studies by {{the expansion of the}} paternal broiler line TT. To represent the TT line, one sire from each sire family (20) and one dam from each dam family (92) were chosen to generate the TT Reference Population. Matings were conducted to avoid relatives in a proportion of 1 male to 5 females (1 : 5) to produce 1600  day-old chicks from 5 hatches, half of each sex. Chicks were <b>pedigree</b> tagged at <b>hatching,</b> kept in collective pens until 35  days of age, and then housed in individual cages for feed conversion evaluation. The chickens received feed and water ad libitum. Commercial broiler diets containing 3150  kcal/kg ME and 21 % CP (1 – 21 days), 3200  kcal/kg ME and 20 % CP (22 – 35 days), and 3200  kcal/kg ME and 18.5 % CP (36 – 41 days) were provided. The lighting schedule consisted of 24  h of light during the first day; then a reduction of one hour a day until reaching natural lighting from 2 to 20  days of age; from 21 to 35  days of age light was provided from 4 : 00  am to 10 : 00  pm, and from 35 to 42  days chickens received 24  hours light. Chick individual weights were obtained at birth, 21 and 35  days of age. At 42  days of age, 1465 chickens were slaughtered and 38 traits were measured for 4 different groups of traits: 1) performance, 2) carcass and cuts, 3) internal organs, and 4) skin. In addition, 17 bone integrity-related traits were also evaluated in the tibia and femur of approximately 590 chickens. Carcass cuts yield and percentage of bones related to body weight were calculated. A total of 85 traits were evaluated in the TT Reference Population.
