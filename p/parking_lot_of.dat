Three main cameras were used, one of which was crane-operated. 60 extras were used, the highest number used in an Sanctuary episode. For the extras to be used in more than one scene, they wore many different costumes. The streeting area was also limited in size, so the streets were recycled frequently with every scene. The practical sets of the Sanctuary offices and corridors were also redesigned to look like the Mumbai Sanctuary.|$|E

5|$|From {{her medical}} findings, Scully discovers that an alien virus {{is keeping the}} abductees alive long enough to cause a radical {{transformation}} to take place, {{similar to the one}} that Miles experienced. After Scully tells Doggett about the genetic transformation, he visits Absalom, who believes that the abductees are being resurrected into aliens who will eventually conquer Earth. Skinner—torn by his decision—decides to euthanize Mulder by pulling him off of life-support so that Krycek does not get his way. Doggett, however, catches Skinner attempting to remove the support. Skinner explains Krycek's demands, but Doggett argues that both options are unreasonable because either Scully's child will die, or Mulder will succumb to the virus. Doggett tries to locate Krycek in the <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the FBI building, but Krycek nearly runs him down with a car, and purposely smashes the vaccine on the ground. Doggett tries to stop him but he escapes. Dejected, Doggett returns to the hospital and tells Skinner he was right not to trust Krycek. He finds Scully preparing Mulder for the now-destroyed vaccine; She tells Doggett that keeping Mulder on life-support was incubating the virus and hastening it along, and that Skinner effectively saved Mulder's life by pulling him off life-support, as it made his temperature drop rapidly without affecting his vital signs. She states that she {{will be able to use}} a combination of antiviral drugs to kill the alien virus if they can get him and his temperature to stabilize.|$|E

She becomes president of the company and rekindles her romance with Liam, ending his relationship with her cousin, Ivy Forrester (Ashleigh Brewer).

He shows her how to have fun by surfing on the beach and even buys her a motorcycle, which she hasn't driven since her miscarriage. The two fall in love and eventually get married on the beach.

40|$|Introduction Recent studies <b>of</b> public {{underground}} <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> {{showed the}} influence of radon concentration and the probable discomfort caused by parking cars. Materials and Methods Radon concentration was measured in semi-closed public <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> in the six governorates of Kuwait, using Durridge RAD 7 radon detector (USA). Results The peak radon concentration in the <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait governorates was relatively higher during winter (63. 15 Bq/m 3) compared to summer (41. 73 Bq/m 3). Radon in the evaluated <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> revealed a mean annual absorbed dose (DRn: 0. 02 mSv/y) and annual effective dose (HE: 0. 06 mSv/y).   Conclusion This study validated {{the influence of}} relative humidity and temperature as the major components of discomfort index (DI). The mean annual absorbed and effective dose  of radon in the evaluated <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> were found below the permissible limits. However, high radon DRn and HE were reported when the assessment included the <b>parking</b> <b>lots,</b> the surrounding residential apartments, and office premises. Furthermore, the time-series analysis indicated significant variations of the seasonal and site-wise distribution of radon concentrations in the indoor evaluated <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> the six Kuwait governorate...|$|R
