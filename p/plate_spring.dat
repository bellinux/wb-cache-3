This paper {{investigated}} the stiffness {{reduction of the}} <b>plate</b> <b>spring</b> made of CFRP (Carbon cloth and epoxy) subjected to ultra high cyclic fatigue loading under high relative humidity. For practical uses, this paper proposes a new design which prevents the significant degradation with stiffness change of the <b>plate</b> <b>spring</b> at high humidity. Remarkable stiffness reduction of the <b>plate</b> <b>spring</b> due to cracks and delaminations around inter layer could be prevented by using CFRTP rather than that by using CFRP, when ultra high cyclic loading {{was applied to the}} <b>plate</b> <b>spring</b> under high humidity condition...|$|E

In chapter VII, solution of a specific problem is compared with a known solution from literature. In chapter VIII, further comparisons are given.

40|$|We are {{developing}} a micro-machined electrostatically actuated Fabry-Perot tunable filter with a large clear aperture for application in high through-put wide-field imaging spectroscopy and lidar systems. In {{the first phase of}} this effort, we {{are developing}} key components based on coupled electro-mechanical simulations. In particular, the movable etalon plate design leverages high coating stresses to yield a flat surface in drum-head tension over a large diameter (12. 5 mm). In this approach, the cylindrical silicon movable plate is back etched, resulting in an optically coated membrane that is suspended from a thick silicon support ring. Understanding the interaction between the support ring, suspended membrane, and coating is critical to developing surfaces that are flat to within stringent etalon requirements. In this work, we present the simulations used to develop the movable <b>plate,</b> <b>spring</b> suspension system, and electrostatic actuation mechanism. We also present results from tests of fabricated proof of concept components...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{magnetic}} suspension system with three flux path control modules was developed. The module {{consists of a}} ferromagnetic plate, a voice coil motor (VCM) for driving the plate and a displacement sensor for detecting {{the position of the}} plate; the sensor is comprised of a V-shape <b>plate</b> <b>spring</b> and four strain guages pasted on it. The ferromagnetic plate is inserted into the gap between a permanent magnet and a suspended object (floator). The lateral position of the plate is controlled with the VCM and the sensor. Since the flux from the permanent magnet to the floator varies according to the position, the amplitude and direction of the attractive force acting on the floator can be adjusted by using multiple modules. Stable suspension was achieved by applying PD control. A fluctuation was observed in the position of the floator. It was reduced by feeding back the lateral motions of the floator. The two- or three-dimensional noncontact manipulation of the floator was also achieved in the developed {{magnetic suspension}} system...|$|E

40|$|A direct {{approach}} {{is used to}} derive the exact solution for the free vibration of thin rectangular <b>plates</b> with discrete <b>sprung</b> masses attached. The plate is simply supported along two opposite edges and elastically supported along the two other edges. The elastic support can represent a range of boundary conditions from free to clamped supports. Considering only the compatibility of the internal forces between the <b>plate</b> and the <b>sprung</b> masses, the equations of the coupled vibration of the plate-spring-mass system are derived. The exact expressions for mode and frequency equations of the coupled vibration of the <b>plate</b> and <b>sprung</b> masses are determined. The solutions converge steadily and monotonically to exact values. The correctness and accuracy of the solutions are demonstrated through comparison with published results. A parametric study is undertaken focusing on the plate {{with one or two}} sprung masses. The results {{can be used as a}} benchmark for further investigation...|$|R

40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of this study was to}} investigate the biomechanical influence of the walking shoe with a <b>plate</b> <b>spring</b> in the heel and interchangeable heel cushioning elements. Eighteen subjects walked in three conditions: 1) the walking shoes Type A- 1 with a soft heel insert, 2) the Type A- 2 shoe with a stiff heel insert, 3) a general walking shoe(Type B). Ground reaction forces, leg movements, leg muscle activity and ankle, knee and hip joint loading were measured and calculated during overground walking. During walking, the ankle is a few degrees more dorsiflexed during landing and the knee is slightly more flexed during takeoff with the Type A shoes. As a result of the changes in the walking movement, the ground reaction forces are applied more quickly and the peak magnitudes are higher. Muscle activity of the quadricep, hamstring and calf muscles decrease during the first 25 % of the stance phase when walking in the Type A shoes. The resultant joint moments at the ankle, knee and hip joints decrease from 30 - 40 % with the largest reductions occurring during landing...|$|E
40|$|The {{influences}} of various factors on {{the mechanics of}} wood cutting by a spring-supported, vertically oscillating frame saw are examined. These include saw tooth pitch, tooth gullet depth and capacity, saw blade overhang, oscillation frequency and amplitude, and log feed speed. [...] The efficiency and effectiveness of the cutting process are dependent primarily on the relative path of motion taken by each tooth through the wood during sawing; thus it is the tooth traces upon which the attention {{of this study is}} focused. The factors listed above govern the shapes of these traces, and thus it is the determination of optimum values for some of these factors which is the main objective here. [...] For the purpose of tooth trace analyses, a computer program has been developed which, when coupled with plotting facilities, allows the user to view a set of simulated relative tooth paths. The program incorporates features which accommodate the other than normal kinematic characteristics of the <b>plate</b> <b>spring</b> supported sash, and combines these influences with those of the factors listed above. Most importantly it allows for the introduction of a non-constant log feed speed function, specifically one which combines a constant with a sinusoidal portion. [...] A detailed analysis of the produced plots with a view to solution to inherent sash saw problems comprises the final portion of this paper. From specific observations and assumptions with respect to the mechanics of cutting of the saw teeth, simultaneous equations are developed and solved for three system variables. Finally, conclusions are drawn and recommendations made with respect {{to the development of a}} more efficient MUN (Memorial University of Newfoundland) Sash Saw design...|$|E
40|$|The work {{is focused}} on {{experimental}} study and modelling of spacer grid influence on single- and two-phase flow. In the experimental study a mock-up of a realistic fuel bundle with five spacer grids of thin <b>plate</b> <b>spring</b> construction was investigated. A special pressure measuring technique {{was used to measure}} pressure distribution inside the spacer. Five pressure taps were drilled in one of the rods, which could exchange position with other rods, in this way providing a large degree of freedom. Laser Doppler Velocimetry was used to measure mean local axial velocity and its fluctuating component upstream and downstream of the spacer in several subchannels with differing spacer part. The experimental study revealed an interesting behaviour. Subchannels from the interior part of the bundle display a different effect on the flow downstream of the spacer compared to subchannels close to the box wall, even if the spacer part is the same. This behaviour is not reflected in modern correlations. The modelling part, first, consisted in comparing the present experimental data to Computational Fluid Dynamics calculations. It was shown that stand-alone subchannel models could predict the local velocity, but are unreliable in prediction of turbulence enhancement due to spacer. The second part of the modelling consisted in developing a deposition model for increase due to spacer. In this study Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) coupled to Discrete Random Walk (DRW) technique was used to model droplet movements through turbulent flow. The LPT technique has an advantage to model the influence of turbulence structure effect on droplet deposition, in this way presenting a generalized model in view of spacer geometry change. The verification of the applicability of LPT DRW method to model deposition in annular flow at Boiling Water Reactor conditions proved that the method is unreliable in its present state. The model calculations compare reasonably well to air-water deposition data, but display a wrong trend if the fluids have a different density ratio than air-water...|$|E

40|$|Abstract − We {{considered}} the uniformity of fabricated micromirror arrays by characterizing the fabrication process and calculating the appropriate driving voltages of micromirrors used as virtual photomask in maskless photolithography. The uniformity of the micromirror array {{in terms of}} driving voltage and optical characteristics is adversely affected by factors, such as the air gap between the bottom electrode and the mirror <b>plate,</b> the <b>spring</b> shape and the deformation of the mirror <b>plate</b> or torsion <b>spring.</b> The thickness deviation of the photoresist sacrificial layer, the misalignment between mirror plate and bottom electrode, the aluminum deposition condition used to produce the spring and the mirror plate, and initial mirror deflection were identified as key factors. Their importance {{lies in the fact}} that they are related to air gap deviations under the mirror plate, asymmetric driving voltages in left and right mirror directions, and the deformation of the Al <b>spring</b> or mirror <b>plate</b> after removal of the sacrificial layer. The plasma ashing conditions used for removing the sacrificial layer also contributed to the deformation of the mirror <b>plate</b> and <b>spring.</b> Driving voltages were calculated for the pixel operation of the micromirror array, and the non-uniform characteristics of fabricated micromirrors were taken into consideration to improve driving performance reliability...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ferromagnetic {{shape memory}} alloy (FSMA) {{composites}} composed of a ferromagnetic material and a {{shape memory alloy}} (SMA) are key material systems for fast-responsive and compact actuators. The function of ferromagnetic material is to induce magnetic force which is then used to induce the stress in the SMA, resulting in the stress-induced martensite transformation (SIM), i. e. change in the Young’s modulus, stiff (austenite) to soft (martensite). This SIM-induced phase change causes larger deformation in the SMA, which is often termed as ‘‘superelastic’’. This paper discusses a simple model by which the stress and strain field in the FSMA composites subjected to bending and torsion loading are computed {{with the aim of}} identifying the optimum geometry of FSMA composites. The results of the present analytical study are utilized to design torque actuator (bending of FSMA composite <b>plate)</b> and <b>spring</b> actuator (torsion of helical FSMA composite spring).
