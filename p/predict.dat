5|$|In 1627, Johannes Kepler {{became the}} first person to <b>predict</b> a transit of Venus, by {{predicting}} the 1631 event. His methods were not sufficiently accurate to <b>predict</b> that the transit would not be visible in most of Europe, and as a consequence, nobody was able to use his prediction to observe the phenomenon.|$|E

40|$|The {{link between}} {{cigarette}} smoking and <b>predicted</b> oxygen uptake was investigated using data for 149 Japanese men not taking medication. Cigarette smoking habits were obtained through interviews by well-trained staff. The influence of cigarette smoking on <b>predicted</b> oxygen uptake, <b>predicted</b> work rate and <b>predicted</b> heart rate were evaluated. <b>Predicted</b> oxygen uptake decreased with age. <b>Predicted</b> oxygen uptake and <b>predicted</b> work rate in men who smoked cigarettes {{was significantly lower}} than in subjects who did not, after adjusting for age. The differences in parameters did not reach significant levels after adjusting for age and physical activity evaluated by Σ[metabolic equivalents × h per week (METs?h/w) ] (<b>predicted</b> oxygen uptake: p = 0. 0632, <b>predicted</b> work rate: p = 0. 0873).

5|$|Testing the {{validity}} of astrology can be difficult, {{because there is no}} consensus amongst astrologers as to what astrology is or what it can <b>predict.</b> Most professional astrologers are paid to <b>predict</b> the future or describe a person's personality and life, but most horoscopes only make vague untestable statements that can apply to almost anyone.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{forecasting}} is {{the application}} {{of science and technology}} to <b>predict</b> the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. Human beings have attempted to <b>predict</b> the weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century.

50|$|The {{most common}} post-translational {{modification}} <b>predicted</b> in FAM46B is phosphorylation. The program, NetPhos 2.0 <b>predicts</b> 23 phosphorylation sites. The majority of <b>predicted</b> phosphorylation are <b>predicted</b> on serine residues (14), {{but there are}} 6 <b>predicted</b> on threonine and 3 on tyrosines.

50|$|Frames {{can also}} be <b>predicted</b> from future frames.The future frames then need to be encoded before the <b>predicted</b> frames and thus, the {{encoding}} order does not necessarily match the real frame order.Such frames are usually <b>predicted</b> from two directions, i.e. from the I- or P-frames that immediately precede or follow the <b>predicted</b> frame.These bidirectionally <b>predicted</b> frames are called B-frames.A coding scheme could, for instance, be IBBPBBPBBPBB.|$|R

5|$|Bohr's {{model was}} not perfect. It could only <b>predict</b> the {{spectral}} lines of hydrogen; it couldn't <b>predict</b> those of multielectron atoms. Worse still, as spectrographic technology improved, additional spectral lines in hydrogen were observed which Bohr's model couldn't explain. In 1916, Arnold Sommerfeld added elliptical orbits to the Bohr model {{to explain the}} extra emission lines, but this made the model very difficult to use, and it still couldn't explain more complex atoms.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles do not redissolve {{immediately}} on recompression, {{and rates of}} gas uptake will alter from initial dive to repetitive dives, so repetitive dives must be handled differently in the mathematical model to <b>predict</b> safe decompression.|$|E

Quadriceps muscle strength was 68 % (20 %) <b>predicted</b> (below 75 % <b>predicted</b> in 17 patients).

This method {{is applied to}} the Advanced Technology Light Twin Engine airplane. The calculated characteristics are correlated against full-scale wind tunnel data. The method <b>predicts</b> the sideslip derivatives fairly well, although angle of attack variations are not well <b>predicted.</b> Spoiler performance was <b>predicted</b> somewhat high but was still reasonable. The rudder derivatives were not well <b>predicted,</b> in particular the effect of angle of attack.

5|$|In {{fields such}} as {{astrophysics}} or meteorology, where direct observation or laboratory experiments are difficult or impossible, the scientific method instead relies on observation and logical inference. In such fields, the test of falsifiability is satisfied when a theory is used to <b>predict</b> the results of new observations. When such observations contradict a theory's predictions, it may be revised or discarded if an alternative better explains the observed facts. For example, Newton's theory of gravitation was replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity when the latter was observed to more precisely <b>predict</b> the orbit of Mercury.|$|E
30|$|In {{the above}} definitions, TP (true positives) {{is the number}} of really coding {{nucleotides}} correctly <b>predicted</b> as coding, TN (true negatives) represents the number of really non-coding nucleotides correctly <b>predicted</b> as non-coding, FP (false positives) {{is the number of}} really non-coding nucleotides incorrectly <b>predicted</b> as coding and FN (false negatives) is the number of really coding nucleotides incorrectly <b>predicted</b> as non-coding. On the level of complete exons, one defines NCE as the number of correctly <b>predicted</b> exons, NPE as the number of <b>predicted</b> exons and NAE as the number of annotated exons. Here, like Burset and Guigó, we consider an exon as correctly <b>predicted</b> when both its limits are identical to the limits of an annotated exon in the input sequences. About the <b>predicted</b> exons whose limits are different from the limits of an annotated exon, we will refer to them as mispredicted exons (when there is some intersection between the <b>predicted</b> exon and an annotated exon) or overpredicted exons (when there is no intersection between the <b>predicted</b> exon and an annotated exon).|$|R

5|$|Models are {{initialized}} {{using this}} observed data. The irregularly spaced observations are processed by data assimilation and objective analysis methods, which perform quality control and obtain values at locations usable by the model's mathematical algorithms (usually an evenly spaced grid). The data are then {{used in the}} model {{as the starting point}} for a forecast. Commonly, the set of equations used to <b>predict</b> the known as the physics and dynamics of the atmosphere are called primitive equations. These equations are initialized from the analysis data and rates of change are determined. The rates of change <b>predict</b> the state of the atmosphere a short time into the future. The equations are then applied to this new atmospheric state to find new rates of change, and these new rates of change <b>predict</b> the atmosphere at a yet further time into the future. This time stepping procedure is continually repeated until the solution reaches the desired forecast time. The length of the time step is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid.|$|E
