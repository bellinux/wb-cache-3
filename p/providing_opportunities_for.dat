5|$|The NCHS-NYP Science and Technology Research Programme is a collaborated {{initiative}} between Nanyang Polytechnic and Nan Chiau High School for {{upper secondary}} levels {{with the aim}} of <b>providing</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> capable science students to acquire science knowledge beyond academic syllabus, carry out research modules using contemporary technology, and interact with specialists in the relevant fields of Sciences and Information Technology. The research projects are presented {{in the form of an}} annual symposium hosted by Yishun Town Secondary and Nan Chiau High alternately, which serves as a platform for students involved to showcase their work to fellow schoolmates and counterparts from other schools.|$|E
5|$|The transit observed, Endeavour {{departed}} Tahiti on 13 July {{and headed}} northwest to allow Cook to survey and name the Society Islands. Landfall {{was made at}} Huahine, Raiatea and Borabora, <b>providing</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> Cook to claim each of them as British territories. However, an attempt to land the pinnace on the Austral Island of Rurutu was thwarted by rough surf and the rocky shoreline. On 15 August, Endeavour finally turned south to explore the open ocean for Terra Australis Incognita.|$|E

Georgia Tech's Division of Professional Practice (DoPP), established in 1912 as the Georgia Institute of Technology Cooperative Division, operates the largest and fourth-oldest cooperative education program in the United States, and is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Cooperative Education. The DoPP is charged with <b>providing</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> students to gain real-world employment experience through four programs, each targeting a different body of students. The Undergraduate Cooperative Education Program is a five-year program in which undergraduate students alternate between semesters of formal instruction at Georgia Tech and semesters of full-time employment with their employers.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the most}} {{interesting}} features of the ranges are these deep gorges cut in the south-eastern side of the Blue Range: Bunyip Chasm, The Terraces, and Fern Chasm are all areas often visited by bushwalkers. Although lower than the mountains which surround it on three sides, the dramatic Cleft Peak is also often visited, so-named for a spectacular cleft separating it into two summits, and <b>providing</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> rockclimbing to a summit, not often necessary with peaks in the Flinders.|$|E

Practice with critical thinking in exploring their own worlds and the worlds of others, with the words that they have at their disposal, results in students experiencing personal empowerment and expressing a personal voice—the unique expression of the self that seems like hearing that particular person speak in their writing.|$|E
25|$|Evidence from {{microfossil}} records {{indicates that}} ferns and woody plants were present on Heard Island during the Tertiary (a period {{with a cool}} and moist climate). Neither group of plants is present today, although potential Tertiary survivors include the vascular plant Pringlea antiscorbutica and six moss species. Volcanic activity has altered the distribution and abundance of the vegetation. The vascular flora covers a range of environments and, although only six species are currently widespread, glacial retreat and the consequent connection of previously separate ice-free areas is <b>providing</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> further distribution of vegetation into adjacent areas.|$|E
25|$|All but the Nicaraguan {{species of}} {{teosinte}} may grow in or very near corn fields, <b>providing</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> introgression between teosinte and maize. First- and later-generation hybrids are {{often found in}} the fields, but the rate of gene exchange is quite low. Some populations of Z. m. mexicana display Vavilovian mimicry within cultivated maize fields, having evolved a maize-like form {{as a result of}} the farmers' selective weeding pressure. In some areas of Mexico, teosintes are regarded by maize farmers as a noxious weed, while in a few areas, farmers regard it as a beneficial companion plant, and encourage its introgression into their maize.|$|E

25|$|Extinction is {{the process}} by which a group of taxa or species dies out, {{reducing}} biodiversity. The moment of extinction is generally considered the death of the last individual of that species. Because a species' potential range may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively after a period of apparent absence. Species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing habitat or against superior competition. In Earth's history, over 99% of all the species that have ever lived are extinct; however, mass extinctions may have accelerated evolution by <b>providing</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> new groups of organisms to diversify.|$|E
25|$|The {{town has}} held many {{cultural}} events. Local poets and writers hold poetry evenings in the town, and music festivals are organised at Cyfarthfa Castle and Park. With this in mind, Menter Iaith Merthyr Tudful (the Merthyr Tydfil Welsh Language Initiative) has successfully transformed the Zoar Chapel and the adjacent vestry building in Pontmorlais {{into a community}} arts venue, Canolfan Soar and Theatr Soar, which run a whole programme of performance events and activities in both Welsh and English, together with a cafe and book shop, specialising in local interest and Welsh language books and CDs. Also on Pontmorlais, Merthyr Tydfil Housing Association was successful {{in a number of}} funding bids to develop the Old Town Hall into a new cultural centre, working in partnership with Canolfan a Theatr Soar to turn the Pontmorlais area into a cultural quarter. The Old Town Hall facility was launched on Saint David's Day 2014. With references to the 1831 Merthyr Rising and the building's red bricks, the venue has been named REDHOUSE – Hen Neuadd Y Dref / Old Town Hall. Merthyr Tydfil College's Arts and Media departments occupy part of the building, holding occasional professional performances at REDHOUSE's Dowlais Theatre and <b>providing</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> students to perform dance, musicals, plays, and instrumental and vocal concerts.|$|E
25|$|The {{inundation}} {{of large}} parts of the Euphrates valley, especially in Turkey and Syria, has led to the flooding of many archaeological sites and other places of cultural significance. Although concerted efforts have been made to record or save as much of the endangered cultural heritage as possible, many sites are probably lost forever. The combined GAP projects on the Turkish Euphrates have led to major international efforts to document the archaeological and cultural heritage of the endangered parts of the valley. Especially the flooding of Zeugma with its unique Roman mosaics by the reservoir of the Birecik Dam has generated much controversy in both the Turkish and international press. The construction of the Tabqa Dam in Syria led to a large international campaign coordinated by UNESCO to document the heritage that would disappear under the waters of Lake Assad. Archaeologists from numerous countries excavated sites ranging in date from the Natufian to the Abbasid period, and two minarets were dismantled and rebuilt outside the flood zone. Important sites that have been flooded or affected by the rising waters of Lake Assad include Mureybet, Emar and Abu Hureyra. A similar international effort was made when the Tishrin Dam was constructed, which led, among others, to the flooding of the important Pre-Pottery Neolithic B site of Jerf el-Ahmar. An archaeological survey and rescue excavations were also carried out in the area flooded by Lake Qadisiya in Iraq. Parts of the flooded area have recently become accessible again due to the drying up of the lake, resulting not only in new possibilities for archaeologists to do more research, but also <b>providing</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> looting, which has been rampant elsewhere in Iraq {{in the wake of the}} 2003 invasion.|$|E
