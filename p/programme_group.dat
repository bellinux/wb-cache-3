40|$|Abstract Background In the {{treatment}} of chronic back pain, cognitive methods are attracting increased attention due to evidence of effectiveness {{similar to that of}} traditional therapies. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the effectiveness of performing a cognitive intervention based on a non-injury model with that of a symptom-based physical training method on the outcomes of low back pain (LBP), activity limitation, LBP attitudes (fear-avoidance beliefs and back beliefs), physical activity levels, sick leave, and quality of life, in chronic LBP patients. Methods The study was a pragmatic, single-blind, randomised, parallel-group trial. Patients with chronic/recurrent LBP were randomised to one of the following treatments: 1. Educational programme : the emphasis was on creating confidence that the back is strong, that loads normally do not cause any damage despite occasional temporary pain, that reducing the focus on the pain might facilitate more natural and less painful movements, and that it is beneficial to stay physically active. 2. Individual symptom-based physical training programme : directional-preference exercises for those centralising their pain with repetitive movements; 'stabilising exercises' for those deemed 'unstable' based on specific tests; or intensive dynamic exercises for the remaining patients. Follow-up questionnaires (examiner-blinded) were completed at 2, 6 and 12 months. The main statistical test was an ANCOVA adjusted for baseline values. Results A total of 207 patients participated with the median age of 39 years (IQR 33 - 47); 52 % were female, 105 were randomised to the educational programme and 102 to the physical training programme. The two groups were comparable at baseline. For the primary outcome measures, there was a non-significant trend towards activity limitation being reduced mostly in the educational <b>programme</b> <b>group,</b> although of doubtful clinical relevance. Regarding secondary outcomes, improvement in fear-avoidance beliefs was also better in the educational <b>programme</b> <b>group.</b> All other variables were about equally influenced by the two treatments. The median number of treatment sessions was 3 for the educational <b>programme</b> <b>group</b> and 6 for the physical training <b>programme</b> <b>group.</b> Conclusions An educational approach to treatment for chronic LBP resulted in at least as good outcomes as a symptom-based physical training method, despite fewer treatment sessions.

Increased depression associated with fear of falls, heightened social isolation and the possible reduction in functional independence imposed by seizures may greatly inhibit {{quality of life in}} older adults. Psychological interventions aimed at reducing seizure frequency and concomitantly addressing depressive symptoms have been shown in a limited number of studies of younger participants to be effective. This study sought to investigate the efficacy of a group intervention combining a range of psychological approaches and techniques for seizure management in adults over the age of 60 years. 37 participants with epilepsy were randomly allocated to a <b>programme</b> <b>group</b> (n= 18) or a relaxation group (n= 19). Each group took part in six, weekly group sessions: the <b>programme</b> <b>group</b> employed cognitive-behavioural techniques and addressed emotional difficulties; the relaxation group received training in progressive muscle relaxation. There was a significant reduction in seizure frequency in both groups, although no changes on measures of depression were reported. The results suggest that a group-based intervention incorporating psychological techniques and relaxation training may be equally effective for improving seizure control...|$|E

Both groups were evaluated at three consecutive moments, each separated by 3 months; the programme was delivered between the first two evaluations. At onset the patient received a workbook containing information, exercises and homework assignments. Psycho-education, behavioural and cognitive techniques were introduced during six 1 -h individual sessions. Compared with controls the <b>programme</b> <b>group</b> reported less symptoms (obstruction, fatigue), better quality of life (activity, symptoms, emotions), decreased negative affectivity, and increased adherence, immediately after finishing the programme and at 3 months follow-up.

30|$|Entering {{into the}} random {{assignment}} study was voluntary for qualifying {{members of the}} three target groups. When they came into Jobcentre Plus offices, their basic demographic information was recorded and they were informed of the possible advantages of participating in the ERA programme. They were then invited to enter the demonstration ‘lottery,’ told {{that they had a}} 50  per cent chance of being selected for the programme, and asked to sign an informed consent form in which they agreed to allow researchers access to certain types of data about them, whether they were assigned to the ERA <b>programme</b> <b>group</b> or to the control group. 7 After completing an informed consent process, 8 half of the participants were assigned randomly to the ERA <b>programme</b> <b>group,</b> and the rest to a control group. Those in the control group could continue to receive whatever services they were normally entitled to receive from Jobcentre Plus or could obtain elsewhere in the community. Thus, control group members in the two New Deal customer groups went on to receive regular New Deal pre-employment services but were expected to have little regular or intensive involvement with Jobcentre Plus staff after entering work. Control group members in the WTC target group would not normally enter the New Deal programme because they were not receiving Income Support or Jobseeker’s Allowance. Therefore, they were not offered pre- or post-employment services or incentives through Jobcentre Plus, though sometimes they sought advice from Jobcentre Plus staff on their own initiative and could seek other services or training on their own.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{reduce the}} {{psychological}} stress {{and improve the}} skills in coping of people who care for relatives with dementia. DESIGN [...] Assessment and suitability of carers by questionnaire; assessment of patients and carers in a hospital outpatient clinic; allocation to groups according to date of application to study. Linkage of groups of four carers and programme coordinator by telephone conference calls over 12 months after programmes. Reassessment at three, six, 12, and, {{for those in the}} "wait list" group, 18 months. SETTING [...] The programmes were conducted in the psychiatry unit of a Sydney teaching hospital. SUBJECTS [...] Eligible patients were less than 80 years old, had mild to moderate dementia, and lived at home with their carer. Of the 96 patient-carer pairs in the study, 33 were in the dementia carers' <b>programme</b> <b>group,</b> 31 were in the memory retraining group, and 32 were in the wait list group. INTERVENTIONS [...] Carers in the dementia carers' programme received training in coping with the difficulties of looking after patients with dementia while the patients had sessions in subjects such as memory retraining. In the memory retraining programme patients were admitted and received the patient component of the carers' programme while their carers had 10 days' respite. In the wait list group carers waited six months before undertaking the carers' programme. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Effect of the programmes on carers' general health questionnaire scores and the rate of placement of patients in institutions. RESULTS [...] At 12 months' follow up the carers' programme had resulted in significantly lower psychological stress among carers than the memory retraining programme (mean (SD) general health questionnaire scores at 0 months were 6. 31 (6. 23) and 3. 60 (6. 25) respectively, and at 12 months were 4. 69 (5. 58) and 7. 40 (9. 39); p less than 0. 05.) In the wait list group distress scores remained stable, even after the carers and patients had undertaken the carers' programme. Patients deteriorated over 12 months regardless of group allocation, but at 30 months, allowing for patients who died and could not be included in the analysis, 65 % of patients in the carers' <b>programme</b> <b>group</b> were still living at home compared with 26 % in the memory retraining <b>programme</b> <b>group.</b> CONCLUSION [...] The intensive intervention programme described for carers of patients with dementia can reduce the psychological morbidity of the carer and delay the placement of the patient in an institution without increasing the use of health services by either patient or carer...|$|E
