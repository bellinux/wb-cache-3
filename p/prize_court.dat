5|$|Surcouf {{returned}} to Ile de France with his prizes, where he arrived on 10 March 1796, although Hasard {{was captured by}} HMS Victorious on the journey back. As Émilie had been armed as a merchant rather than a privateer, the <b>Prize</b> <b>court</b> seized her prizes and sold them {{for the benefit of}} the State, although their capture was declared to be legal. Surcouf {{returned to}} France to claim his prize money, and on 3 September 1797, the government finally granted him 660,000 francs, of which he only received 80,000.|$|E
5|$|Constellation {{began taking}} on {{prisoners of war}} from L'Insurgente, but by nightfall the two ships had become {{separated}} in a storm. Left aboard L'Insurgente were Constellations First Lieutenant John Rodgers, Midshipman David Porter, and 11 enlisted men, along with 170 French prisoners. The Americans were forced to sail the vessel short-handed while guarding the French prisoners. As the prisoners outnumbered their captors and no gear to secure them could be found aboard, the Frenchmen were driven into L'Insurgentes lower holds. Finally, after three nights, L'Insurgente {{was brought in to}} Saint Kitts where Constellation was waiting for her. While at the American naval depot at Saint Kitts, Constellations troublesome 24-pounder guns were removed and replaced with 18-pounder cannons. At the American <b>prize</b> <b>court</b> in Norfolk, Virginia, L'Insurgente was condemned to be sold as a war prize, with the proceeds distributed to the crew of Constellation. Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddert managed to negotiate the prize award down from $120,000 to $84,000 before purchasing L'Insurgente and commissioning her in the United States Navy as the USS Insurgent.|$|E

25|$|Britain {{had been}} {{at war with the}} new Batavian Republic since its {{alliance}} with France in January 1795 and on 6 July 1797, Roebuck was serving in Leeward Islands under Rear Admiral Henry Harvey, when she captured Batave, a Dutch 10-gun privateer, just off Barbados. More captures followed in February 1798, a brig William and a schooner Betsey were captured on 8 February but both were later condemned by a <b>prize</b> <b>court,</b> and while cruising off Martinique on 19 February, Roebuck fell in with and captured a French 10-gun privateer, Parfait. Returning to Deptford in November 1798, Roebuck was refitted as troopship, at a cost of £10,044. She was recommissioned in July 1799.|$|E

25|$|Following the Israeli {{declaration}} of independence on 14 May 1948, the Permanent Boycott Committee ceased to function upon the outbreak of war between Israel and surrounding Arab States on 15 May 1948, and the Arab League repeated its calls for a ban on all financial and commercial transactions with Palestinian Jews, boycotting the newly formed State of Israel. The Arab League cut off postal, telegraphic, and radio communications with Israel, and Arab States began to impose a land, sea, and air blockade on the fledgling state. Israeli goods, shipped through Alexandria, Port Suez and Port Said, were confiscated by Egyptian inspectors. A <b>prize</b> <b>court</b> established in Alexandria in 1949 authorized the seizure of cargo ships destined for Israel. In 1950, regulations were promulgated to allow the search of ships and aircraft and the seizure of Israeli-bound goods found within.|$|E
500|$|During World War I, the Batavier Line {{attempted}} to maintain service, but in March 1915, Batavier V was seized as a prize by German submarine [...] and sailed into Zeebrugge in German-occupied Belgium.

50|$|Prize crew is a {{term used}} to {{indicate}} a number of crew members of a ship chosen {{to take over the}} operations of a captured ship. Prize crews were required to take their prize to appropriate <b>prize</b> <b>courts,</b> which would determine whether the ship's officers and crew had sufficient cause to have the value of the prize awarded to them.|$|R
50|$|The state issued nearly 1,000 {{letters of}} marque authorizing privateering activities. The Massachusetts <b>prize</b> <b>courts</b> were busiest in 1779, when more than 180 prizes were adjudicated. This {{activity}} resulted in a demand for prison capacity for the captured crews, and the competition between the state navy and the privateers resulted in increased costs to the state to man its ships.|$|R
5000|$|Under {{contemporary}} {{international law}} and treaties, nations may still bring enemy vessels before their <b>prize</b> <b>courts,</b> to be condemned and sold. But no nation now offers a share to the officers or crew who risked {{their lives in the}} capture:Self-interest was the driving force that compelled men of the sea to accept the international law of prize ... merchants because it brought a valuable element of certainty to their dealings. If the rules were clear and universal, they could ship their goods abroad in wartime, after first buying insurance against known risks. ... On {{the other side of the}} table, those purchasing vessels and cargoes from <b>prize</b> <b>courts</b> had the comfort of knowing that what they bought was really theirs. The doctrine and practice of maritime prize was widely adhered to for four centuries, among a multitude of sovereign nations, because adhering to it was in the material interest of their navies, their privateersmen, their merchants and bankers, and their sovereigns. Diplomats and international lawyers who struggle in this world to achieve a universal rule of law may well ponder on this lesson.|$|R
500|$|On 28 October, British {{authorities}} detained {{the ship}} at Gibraltar. Because neutral Italy did not restrict the shipment of copper (which {{could be used}} in war munitions) to Germany or Austria-Hungary, the British claimed the right to detain the ship—a claim disputed by the U.S. State Department. Kroonland was allowed to resume her journey on 8 November after the copper and rubber were unloaded and taken to a <b>prize</b> <b>court.</b> [...] The ship arrived at Naples on 11 November, then completed the rest of her Mediterranean trek. Returning to New York, she carried the new minister from Bulgaria to the United States, arriving on 4 December. IMM had advertised that Kroonland would sail the Mediterranean route again in December, but the liner was removed from the route.|$|E
500|$|When Castor {{returned}} to Britain, the frigate was classed by the Admiralty and the Navy Board as [...] "salvage" [...] {{rather than as}} a prize. The laws regarding salvage meant that the proportion of prize money due to be paid to Laforey and his crew was significantly reduced by the declaration. The grounds for this judgement were that after its capture by the French, Castor was not taken into a French harbour and properly condemned by a French <b>prize</b> <b>court</b> and commissioned into the French Navy, the normal legal requirement for what was termed a [...] "complete prize". On behalf of his men Laforey brought a legal challenge against the ruling to the High Court of Admiralty to determine the status of Castor. The judge, Sir James Marriott, heard evidence from a number of parties, including a deposition by Captain L'Huillier that described Admiral Nielly's standing orders to fit out any captured warships at sea for continued service in the campaign. After considering the evidence Marriott ruled that Castor was a legitimate prize [...] "setting forth as a ship of war", and that the normal prize rules should apply to Laforey's case. The prize money for the purchase of the frigate was therefore authorised to be paid at Plymouth on 20 July 1795.|$|E
500|$|Several {{influential}} {{decisions of}} the House of Lords have determined the limited scope {{for the use of}} prerogative powers. In 1915, an appeal was made to the House of Lords, Re Petition of Right ("Shoreham Aerodrome Case"), but during the appeal the case was settled and the appeal withdrawn when the Crown agreed to pay compensation. The appeal was from a unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal that the Crown, both under the statutory Defence of the Realm Regulations and by the royal prerogative, was entitled to take and occupy, for military purposes in wartime, a commercial airfield on the south coast. The government argued that this action was to defend against an invasion; the courts held that for the prerogative to be exercised, the government must demonstrate that a threat of invasion exists. This was backed up by The Zamora (1916), where the Privy Council, on appeal from the <b>Prize</b> <b>Court,</b> held generally that to exercise a power not granted by statute (such as a prerogative power) the government must prove to the court that the exercise is justified. The next decision came in Attorney General v De Keyser's Royal Hotel Ltd (1920), where the House of Lords confirmed that a statutory provision in an area where prerogative powers are in use [...] "abridges the Royal Prerogative while it is in force to this extent – that the Crown can only do the particular thing under and in accordance with the statutory provisions, and that its prerogative power to do that thing is in abeyance".|$|E

5000|$|The {{letter of}} marque by its terms {{required}} privateers to bring captured vessels and their cargoes before admiralty courts of their own or allied countries for condemnation. Applying the rules and customs of <b>prize</b> law, the <b>courts</b> decided whether the {{letter of marque}} was valid and current, and whether the captured vessel or its cargo in fact belonged to the enemy (not always easy, when flying false flags was common practice), and if so the prize and its cargo were [...] "condemned," [...] to be sold at auction with the proceeds divided among the privateer's owner and crew. A <b>prize</b> <b>court's</b> formal condemnation was required to transfer title; otherwise the vessel's previous owners might well reclaim her on her next voyage, and seek damages for the confiscated cargo.|$|R
500|$|All of the {{captured}} Dutch ships were {{bought into the}} Royal Navy, Gleijkheid, Vrijheid, Wassenaar, Haarlem and Alkmaar under their own names (although in most cases they were anglicised) and Admiraal Tjerk Hiddes De Vries as the simpler Devries. Two were completely renamed, due to the prior existence of ships with their names in the Royal Navy; Jupiter became HMS Camperdown and Hercules became HMS Delft. None of these ships was ever in sufficient condition for service in open waters: the damage suffered at Camperdown proved too severe {{for them to be}} fully repaired. In addition, ships of Dutch construction had lighter hulls and flatter bottoms than ships of other nations as they were designed to operate off the shallow waters of the Dutch coast, and as a result they were of little use to the ocean-going Royal Navy. All the prizes were immediately relegated to harbour duty, and none were used for front-line service. Although the <b>prize</b> <b>court</b> took several years to determine the prize money that would be awarded for the battle, the initial estimates of £60,000 (the equivalent of £ as of [...] ) proved pessimistic: Duncan and his men were eventually awarded £150,000 (the equivalent of £ as of [...] ), although they were forced to defend a claim from the Russian Navy on behalf of the squadron that had reinforced Duncan in May. Since this force had played no part in the battle and had been considered a liability rather than a benefit by the British commanders, the claim was rejected, but legal fees and other claims reduced the eventual payment. Following the award of the first £10,000 instalment, Duncan was given the unique honour of permission to buy shares on the London Stock Exchange at ⅞ market price.|$|E
2500|$|The Union {{squadron}} {{captured the}} abandoned Little Rebel {{and sent her}} to Cairo, Illinois, June 11 for repairs and for adjudication before the Illinois <b>Prize</b> <b>Court.</b> Her seizure was judged to be legal, so she was purchased by the U.S. Navy from the <b>prize</b> <b>court.</b> [...] On January 9, 1863, she entered Federal service. She was first assigned to a flotilla of gunboats commanded by Lieutenant Commander LeRoy Fitch, who had to suppress guerrilla activity on the Ohio, Cumberland, and Tennessee Rivers.
