40|$|This paper gives a new {{approach}} for modeling the fluid-structure interaction of servovalve component-actuator. The analyzed valve is a precision flow control valve-jet pipe electrohydraulic servovalve. The positioning of an actuator depends upon the flow rate from control ports, in turn depends on the spool position. Theoretical investigation is made for No-load condition and Load condition for an actuator. These are used in finite element modeling of an actuator. The fluid-structure-interaction (FSI) is established between the piston and the fluid cavities at the <b>piston</b> <b>end.</b> The fluid cavities were modeled with special purpose hydrostatic fluid elements while the piston is modeled with brick elements. The finite element method is used to simulate the variation of cavity pressure, cavity volume, mass flow rate, and the actuator velocity. The finite element analysis is extended to study the system's linearized response to harmonic excitation using direct solution steady-state dynamics. It was observed from the analysis that the natural frequency of the actuator depends upon {{the position of the}} piston in the cylinder. This is a close match with theoretical and simulation results. The effect of bulk modulus is also presented in the paper...|$|E
40|$|Compressibility of air used as {{a working}} medium in {{pneumatic}} control systems raise certain difficulties in calculating dynamic characteristics of the pneumatic drive and solving problems of its regulation. These difficulties are due {{to a number of}} factors:    - flow of compressed air through the narrow working splits of distributive and throttling devices of pneumatic control;    - filling in and discharging the pneumatic actuator cavities of variable volume (piston and rod cavities of the air-cylinder) under conditions of heat and mass transfer;    - simultaneous filling in and discharging a pneumatic cavity of permanent volume (receiver);    - pneumatic cylinder <b>piston</b> <b>end</b> positioning alteration under variable loading and at the moment of shutdown; A number of factors {{have a significant impact on}} the <b>piston</b> <b>end</b> positioning alteration value, namely an initial positioning of the piston at the moment of its shutdown, which determines the volume of the pneumatic cylinder cavity; a value of the permanent component of the load at the moment the piston shuts down and its change during keeping time period; transmission coefficient of the positioning component of the load; a working area of the air-cylinder piston and also an atmospheric pressure reduction, which can significantly affect the operation of control systems of a small aircraft at high altitudes. With a view to deepening the problem of calculation and design of pneumatic actuators, it is shown that the relationship between the parameters of compressed air and their changes is determined by the properties of thermodynamic processes under conditions of heat and mass transfer. In pneumatic actuators for general industrial use, the pressure of compressed air does not exceed a value equal to 1 MPa. In this case, the working medium can be regarded as an ideal gas in simplified calculations. Based on the general equation of thermodynamics, the paper considers the particular cases of a changing gas state process under its constant temperature, pressure, and volume and also in the absolute or partial absence of heat exchange with the surrounding medium. The inconstancy of the compressed air mass during filling in and discharging of pneumatic cavities of variable volume causes non-stationary thermodynamic processes in the pneumatic actuators and requires their specifying in conditions of heat and mass exchange. The pneumatic actuator piston speed is related to the peculiarities of the working medium movement through the narrow slits of distribution and control devices of pneumatic automation due to dependency of the flow on the outflow parameter, which in turn is related to the criticality of the outflow process (the ratio of the pressure at the outlet of the throttling device and at its inlet). It is shown that when calculating and designing the pneumatic drives, including closed-loop ones, as well as for evaluating their dynamic characteristics, a system solution of the equations determining the processes of filling and discharging the cavities of the pneumatic cylinder is required, taking into account the peculiarities of compressed air movement through the narrow slits of pneumatic automation devices. The outflow parameter available in the equations of the pneumatic drive dynamics and determined by the outflow process criticality and by the heat exchange conditions (a poly-tropic index) requires their numerical solution. </p...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that in a {{hydraulic}} servomechanism the ram exhibits in the open-loop a linear motion in addition to its usual oscillatory motion for a sinusoidal input. This phenomenon, called drift, gives rise to an apparent instability of the system and the study of the dynamic behaviour becomes difficult. A theoretical investigation into the causes and remedy of this phenomenon is made on a loaded system with an asymmetric linear hydraulic motor controlled by an open-centre three-way spool valve. The original non-linear system equation in dimensionless form is derived taking into account the effects of leakage, compressibility (both fixed and varying) and area ratio, and solved numerically by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. It is shown that the determination of the reverse flow boundary is essential prior to the study of drijt, since the rate of drift will be maximum near the boundary frequency. I t is also shown that while the effect of compressibility due to the change in initial volume is mainly responsible for driji for an area ratio of I: 2, the effect of area ratio itself is predominant for an area ratio not equal to I: 2. I t is observed that in most of the cases the drift can be removed by giving a proper input shift to the valve. A method of calculating the input shift required is suggested and the effects of different system parameters on its magnitude are studied.

40|$|Abstract – Control of seismic, {{medical and}} {{automobile}} vibrations represents a vast {{area of research}} that is growing rapidly. Magneto rheological (MR) dampers are {{a new class of}} devices that match well with the requirements and constraints of applications, including the necessity of having very low power requirements. The performance of MR damper depends on its magnetic and hydraulic circuit design. In this paper a finite element model is used to examine and investigate the 2 - D axi-symmetric MR damper. Nine different configurations of piston for MR damper are simulated in order to investigate how the profile of the piston affected the maximum pressure drop that the damper could provide. The piston velocity and the input current to the coil are varied to evaluate the resulting change in magnetic flux density (B) and pressure drop (ΔP).
