40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{features}} of agricultural <b>extension</b> models and <b>policy</b> in selected sub- Saharan Africa countries. This {{is based on the}} premise that the discussion of <b>extension</b> <b>policy</b> in SSA countries can not be isolated from the extension models that are applied in these countries. While the models are direct products of the type of policy that has been adopted, the policy dictates the models to be used in each country. A major problem of organizing agricultural extension in developing countries is the absence of a legal and policy framework for providing the service. Putting in place a legal and policy framework is one basic new and indispensable way of conducting extension in the developing countries. It will help streamline the confusion currently existing in the effort to transfer agricultural knowledge to farmers, particularly in the areas of service provision, programme development and funding. In literature, the present forms of <b>extension</b> <b>policy</b> are Provisional <b>Extension</b> <b>Policies,</b> decrees and proclamation and legislated <b>extension</b> <b>policies.</b> Factors driving <b>extension</b> <b>policy</b> are population, natural resources and environment. Increasing population will demand more resources from extension in forms of skills, training, diversification of livelihoods and pressure on natural resources. The paper recommends that SSA countries adopt the legislated <b>extension</b> <b>policies</b> option for the improvement extension service delivery and reduce the contradictions in extension models...|$|R
50|$|Federal {{acknowledgment}} of the tribes is of critical importance because it {{is directly related to}} the other problems that the ACCIP was tasked with addressing, namely the “continuing social and economic crisis” of California Indians. As the report by the UCLA American Indian Studies Center to the ACCIP explains, “In most cases, unrecognized tribes receive no funding at all from the federal government.” Lack of recognition prevents tribes from getting access to the funding needed for programs to raise poverty levels by improving education and employment opportunities. It also places obstacles in the way of improving health care. Finally, tribes without recognition are restricted in their ability to preserve their cultural heritage in such matters as the protection of sacred sites. The Advisory Council on California Indian <b>Policy</b> <b>Extension</b> Act of 1998 extended the life of the council to March 31, 2000, but for many tribes the struggle for recognition continues.|$|E

40|$|We {{model the}} {{influence}} of opportunities in a hybrid inspection and replacement policy. The base policy has two phases: an initial inspection phase in which the system is replaced if found defective; and a later wear-out phase that terminates with replacement and during {{which there is no}} inspection. The efficacy of inspection is modelled using the delay time concept. Onto this base model, we introduce events that arise at random and offer opportunities for cost-efficient replacement, and we investigate the efficacy of additional opportunistic replacements within the policy. Furthermore, replacements are considered to be heterogeneous and of variable quality. This is a natural policy for heterogeneous systems. Our analysis suggests that a <b>policy</b> <b>extension</b> that allows opportunities to be utilised offers benefit, in terms of cost-efficiency. This benefit is significant compared to those offered by age-based inspection or preventive replacement. In addition, opportunistic replacement may simplify maintenance planning...|$|E
40|$|The postMessage {{mechanism}} in HTML 5 enables Web content from different origins {{to communicate with}} each other, thus relaxing the same origin policy. It is especially popular in websites that include third-party content. Each message contains accurate information about its origin, but the receiver must check this information before accepting the message. The responsibility for preventing cross-origin attacks is thus partially delegated from the Web browser to the implementors of postMessage receiver functions. We collected postMessage receivers from the Alexa top 10, 000 websites and found that many perform origin checks incorrectly or not at all. This results in exploitable vulnerabilities in 84 popular sites, including cross-site scripting and injection of arbitrary content into local storage. We propose two defenses. The first uses pseudo-random tokens to authenticate the source of messages and is intended for the implementors of third-party content. The second, based on a Content Security <b>Policy</b> <b>extension,</b> is intended for website owners. The two defenses are independent and can be deployed jointly or separately. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Social Network {{applications}} are gaining momentum. However, equally important, privacy is being shown a crucial requirement. Nowadays, privacy preferences on Social Network applications consist only on allowing or restricting {{access to information}} based on attributes of users who are part in the very same network. This paper tries to enhance privacy and provide automatic reactions to events via a very flexible specification of privacy policies and the reasoning associated to them. In our approach {{it is possible to}} include Social Semantic data exposed on the Web into the policy definition and reasoning process. We introduce the notion of reactive Semantic Web policies offering higher control of the communications and interactions among Social Network applications and/or its users. We also present SPoX (Skype <b>Policy</b> <b>Extension),</b> which is an implementation that allows policy-driven behaviour control based on the Social Network and communication software Skype, including the capacity of automatically react in certain situations based on user-defined reactive policies such as, for instance, to automatically deny or let through Skype calls and messages based on existing online Social Web data. ...|$|E

To elaborate such guidelines, crop models assist in assessing the conjunctive effect of different environmental stresses on crop yield.

From the start of the critical growth stage onwards, we simulate dry weather conditions and derive optimal frequencies (time interval of a fixed net application depth) of irrigation to avoid drought stress during the sensitive growth stages and to guarantee maximum water productivity. By summarizing these results in easy readable charts, they become appropriate for <b>policy,</b> <b>extension</b> and farmer level use.
