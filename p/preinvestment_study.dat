The implementation of the contractual repareclling of the building land is a precondition for selling the apartments. Based on the influence analysis of the implementation of the contractual repareclling of the building land and the economical success of the project, the static and dynamic models were designed and four different dates of contractual repareclling were set. Results show that the economic success of the project is largely influenced by the date of the contractual repareclling of the building land: The more the dates of the reparcelling implementation and the end of construction work are apart, the less successful the project is economically. If the contractual repareclling of the building land begins in 2009 or later, there is no profit, i. e. the project is unsuccessful.
