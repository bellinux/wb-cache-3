40|$|Living {{stages of}} the {{quarantine}} pest Anoplophora chinensis Forster, the so called Citrus Longhorned Beetle (CLB), have been detected repeatedly during import inspections of young trees in several European Union member states. CLB infested plants show almost no external symptoms for identification by visual inspection. Therefore, according to the European Union <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> <b>legislation</b> (EU-Commission-Implementing Decision 2012 / 138 /EG), destructive sampling of the plants at random is required. Infrared thermography has been assessed as alternative, non-destructive testing method. Due to the quarantine status of CLB, the native goat moth, Cossus cossus L., was used as surrogate for the studies. Three types of thermography cameras have been tested using standardized wooden samples during two long-term measurements. Neither passive nor active thermographic methods were able to visualize enough differences in temperatures to detect larvae, boreholes or boredust inside of wooden samples. Therefore infrared thermography with its currently available technology {{seems to be no}} appropriate technique for detecting insect stages or defects in young trees...|$|E

40|$|Many genera {{and species}} of {{nematodes}} attack almost all crops affecting their yield potential. Their distribution, diversity and potential damage depend on many factors including their centres {{of origin and}} subsequent spread, the agroecological conditions and the tolerance and resistance of the crops used in that agricultural system. A sustainable approach to the control of plant-parasitic nematodes is to prevent their spread on to clean land. Phytosanitary measures are a major strategy to achieve this aim, and their implementation {{is part of the}} regulatory system of each country. A history and description of international <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> <b>legislation</b> is given by Hockland et al. (2006). The interception or detection of listed or unlisted quarantine organisms could result in destruction of a shipment or infected crop, or a banning of growing host plants on infested land.

40|$|Being {{aware of}} the {{potentially}} devastating impacts of plant diseases on food security, governments have designed and employ <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> <b>legislation</b> to prevent or inhibit the worst impacts. The development of such policies in Britain, and latterly in Europe, can be closely linked to disease events {{that have occurred in}} the potato sector. We analyse early and current examples of policies governing potato diseases in Britain to identify the decision processes leading to the implementation of such phytosanitary policies and how they have evolved over time and in response to different disease threats. Reasons for developing and implementing phytosanitary policies include the desire to prevent pathogens being introduced (entering and establishing in a new area), the protection of export markets, and the lack of effective control measures. Circumstances in which regulatory policies would not be appropriate could include situations where a disease is already widely distributed, unacceptable costs, lack of exclusion measures, or difficulties of disease diagnosis. We conclude that in general, government policies have worked well in protecting British potato growing over the last one hundred years, despite of the failures of some of the policies discussed here. They have also contributed much to the development of plant health policies for other crops. Voluntary grower initiatives are a new mechanism complementing existing formal policies with an additional level of security that allows individual growers to take on additional responsibility rather than relying entirely on government legislation...|$|E

[URL] audienceThe potato cyst nematodes Globodera pallida and G. rostochiensis {{are listed}} in the EU Plant Health Directive 2000 / 29 /EC and are also subject to the new EU Council Directive 2007 / 33 /EC on the control of potato cyst nematodes, requiring unilateral suppression of these pests in Europe. At the same time there is also pressure to increase world trade in potatoes. Such pressure has to be balanced by the risks involved in the associated spread of these pests and subsequent problems in management. Populations of the potato cyst nematodes from outside Europe, in particular South America, which is considered the origin of G. pallida and G. rostochiensis, pose a risk to those European countries where limited genetic variability of these nematode species has been recorded. The development and usage of resistant cultivars under such conditions has formed a pivotal role in integrated management programmes in Europe. Molecular studies have shown that populations of G. pallida and G. rostochiensis from South America have a different genetic composition from those in Europe. The introduction of such populations would pose a threat to the use of resistant cultivars as a major tool in reducing the potential spread and damage caused by these species. At present, an inability to link precisely genetic variability to the virulence characteristics of a specific nematode population, and quickly identify the virulence status of intercepted populations for inspection purposes, strengthens the case for using <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> <b>legislation</b> to prevent their introduction...|$|E
40|$|The Panel {{conducted}} a pest risk assessment for Xanthomonas campestris (all strains pathogenic to Citrus) for the EU territory and {{an assessment of}} the effectiveness of present EU requirements against Xanthomonas strains pathogenic to citrus. The risk assessment was conducted under the scenario of absence of the current specific EU <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> <b>legislation</b> and the assumption that citrus-exporting countries apply measures to reduce yield and quality losses. Risk reduction options were systematically identified and evaluated. The strains of X. campestris pathogenic to citrus have been reclassified as four distinct infraspecific taxa within two species: X. citri and X. alfalfae. Only two pathovars (X. citri pv. citri and X. citri pv. aurantifolii) are responsible for the citrus bacterial canker that presents a major risk for the citrus industry in the EU. Seven entry pathways have been identified and evaluated. The likelihood of entry was rated unlikely for fruit, very likely for fruit plants for planting, moderately likely for ornamental plants for planting and unlikely for leaves and twigs. The uncertainty of probability of entry was rated as high. The probability of establishment was rated as moderately likely to likely with a medium uncertainty because host plants are widely present in EU areas where environmental conditions are suitable. Once established, spread would be likely with a low uncertainty. The impact of the disease, even if control measures are applied, was rated as moderate to major with a medium uncertainty. The disease would cause yield losses in areas where citrus is the main crop, increase the need for control measures and create environmental problems. The combined EU regulations {{have been shown to be}} effective in preventing the introduction of X. citri pv. citri or X. citri pv. aurantifolii in the EU, as no outbreaks of citrus canker in the EU territory have been reported...|$|E

40|$|The Panel on Plant Health {{conducted}} a pest risk assessment for Scirrhia pini for the European Union (EU) territory, identified risk management options and evaluated their effectiveness. The risk assessment was conducted {{taking into account}} current EU legislation. The Panel also provided an opinion {{on the effectiveness of}} the present EU requirements against this organism listed in Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. Considering that there has been taxonomic confusion over the pest mentioned in the EU <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> <b>legislation,</b> the assessment was carried out for Dothistroma septosporum (the anamorph of S. pini, the latter renamed to Mycosphaerella pini) and Dothistroma pini (teleomorph unknown), both of which cause Dothistroma needle blight. Three major pathways for entry were identified: host plants intended for planting/grafting (excluding fruit and seeds), natural means (wind, rain, wind-driven rain, etc.), and host plants and plant parts with foliage not intended for planting (e. g., fresh branches, cut Christmas trees, etc.); probability of entry was considered very likely, likely and unlikely, respectively, with high uncertainty. The establishment and further spread were both considered very likely. The current consequences were considered major and they include loss of wood volume, tree mortality, and losses in terms of landscape value, amenity value, recreational uses and tourism. The Panel concluded that introduction and spread of the two pests are not fully prevented by Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC, mainly because of the possibility to import and trade host plant material other than Pinus plants for planting. In order to prevent the potentially serious impacts in those parts of the risk assessment area where the pathogens are currently not known to occur, additional risk reduction options have been identified, in the form of simultaneous implementation of measures targeted at reducing the movement of infected host plants and the further spread of the pests by natural mean...|$|E
40|$|The EFSA Panel on Plant Health {{conducted}} a pest risk assessment for Dickeya dianthicola for the EU territory under the scenario of current EU <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> <b>legislation</b> and identified and evaluated risk reduction options. The probability of entry was considered low for carnation cuttings and mother plants because association of D.  dianthicola with carnation is rare nowadays. Probability of entry was considered higher for other host plants for planting {{that are not}} subject to statutory control. However, this pathogen already occurs in these crops in the EU, and its transfer from them to carnation is unlikely. The probability of establishment is high in the open field but low in protected crops. The probability of spread is moderate in the open field but low in protected crops. Under current phytosanitary measures, but with voluntary certification and sanitation practices in place, consequences for carnation are minimal since no carnation crop losses {{have been reported in the}} last 25 years. The risk reduction options with best effectiveness and feasibility are those addressing the sanitary status of the propagation material. However, although the prevalence of D.  dianthicola on carnation is low at present, current EU measures appear to have some potential weaknesses, particularly because of lack of details on the testing of mother plants. If the current regulation were to be removed, no major consequences or changes in the potential impact of D.  dianthicola are expected provided the current general hygiene practices applied in the European voluntary certification schemes are maintained. If, on the other hand, the current legislation were removed and a voluntary certification scheme was not maintained, contamination of carnation crops by D.  dianthicola is expected, with ensuing detrimental effects. Additional risk reduction options to reduce the probability of entry, establishment, spread and impact were identified. Uncertainties on the assessment are discussed...|$|E

The Panel also evaluated {{the effectiveness of the}} present EU requirements (Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC) against this organism. S. chrysanthemi causes ray blight of Chrysanthemum × morifolium and is present in the EU. The Panel conducted the risk assessment considering the current EU <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> <b>legislation</b> in place and reached the following conclusions. The probability of entry of S. chrysanthemi into the EU on the Chrysanthemum × morifolium plants for planting pathway and the cut flowers pathway is unlikely with a medium uncertainty. The probabilities of establishment and spread of S. chrysanthemi in the EU are very likely with low uncertainties, as the host is extensively grown in the EU and the climatic conditions are suitable for infection, sporulation, spread and survival of the pathogen. The damage caused by the pathogen in the EU is currently minor because of the existing agricultural practices applied to chrysanthemum crops. No negative environmental impacts are foreseen. The effectiveness of the current EU requirement of visual inspection of host plant material in reducing the risk of introduction into, and spread within, the EU of the pathogen is low with a high uncertainty, as {{it is not possible to}} distinguish the effect of the legislation from that of the voluntary certification schemes currently used for the production of chrysanthemum plant propagation material. If the current EU regulations regarding the pest were to be removed and the voluntary certification schemes remained in place, there would be no great effect on the risk of introduction, spread and impact of S. chrysanthemi in the EU territor...|$|E

The POnTE {{project was}} funded under the H 2020 -SFS- 2014 - 2015 Sustainable Food Security call (Topic SFS- 03 a- 2014 : Native and alien pests in {{agriculture}} and forestry). POnTE focuses {{to minimize the}} risk of introduction/impact of emerging pests threatening EU agriculture and forestry. The target pathogens are: 1) Xylella fastidiosa and its vectors in olive, grapevine, citrus, stone fruit, ornamentals and landscape trees of high socioeconomic importance; 2) ‘Ca. Liberibacter solanacearum’ and its vectors affecting a number of strategic crops such as potato, tomato and carrot; and 3) Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus (anomorph. Chalara fraxinea) and Phytophtora spp. seriously affecting broadleaf and conifer species in forest ecosystems. Targeted pests, their vectors and the host response will be explored using innovative approaches (NGS, transcriptomic). Diseases surveillance and epidemiology given by current methods will integrate improved survey protocols and remote sensing. Innovative IPM will include studies of microbiome to develop sustainable solutions in line with the EU <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> <b>legislation.</b> New knowledge gained with POnTE will result in an outcome-based pest prevention and management work plan to: a) implement area-wide pest risk assessments; b) prevent the entry and develop surveillance and early detection tools (diagnostic kits, lab-on-chip, new biomarkers); c) mitigate the spread and reduce the socio-economic impact; d) IPM based on disease resistance, disease-free seeds, cultural practices and physical environmentally-friendly treatments; e) support knowledge-based decision-making policies at EU level. The proposal fosters and promotes a multi-actor approach and transnational research collaborations among 25 Partners at the forefront of research in plant protection, agro-engineering and economics.

40|$|The European Commission {{requested}} EFSA {{to provide}} a scientific opinion on the Pest Risk Analysis (PRA) made by Spain on Bactrocera zonata, a fruit fly listed in the quarantine list of the Community <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> <b>legislation</b> (Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC) and in particular to consider the threats posed by Bactrocera zonata to the whole Community, to identify the fruit species at risk and {{to determine whether the}} management measures proposed are appropriate. Bactrocera zonata (Saunders), the peach fruit fly, attacks ripe fruit of many species, especially mango, peach and guava, rendering them inedible. It is common in many tropical and sub-tropical countries of Asia, especially the Indian sub-continent, and has recently invaded Egypt. It is absent from the European Community and listed in Annex I Part A Section I of the Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC under the synonym Dacus zonatus as a harmful organism whose introduction into, and spread within, all member states shall be banned. In 2005, Spain detected Bactrocera larvae, assumed to be B. zonata, in two consignments of citrus from Egypt and conducted a pest risk assessment and an analysis of risk management options following the 1997 version of the EPPO pest risk analysis (PRA) scheme. The Spanish PRA concluded that B. zonata poses a serious threat to fruit production in the Mediterranean countries of Europe and that appropriate management measures should include phytosanitary treatments before export, targeted entry inspections and the prohibition of fruit carried by passengers. The EFSA Scientific Panel on Plant Health conducted a detailed review of the Spanish PRA and concluded that the PRA does provide sufficient evidence to support the listing of B. zonata in Annex I Part A Section I of the Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. The additional work required to determine the threat to the whole community, identify the fruit species at greatest risk and select the most appropriate management options is outlined. The Panel found that, although the Spanish pest risk assessment could be improved, it did provide sufficient evidence to justify an analysis of risk management options. It confirmed that B. zonata is capable of entering, establishing, spreading and causing significant impacts on fruit production in southern member states. However, the pest risk assessment could be improved, principally by (a) clearly defining the PRA area, (b) updating, extending and analysing data on the different pathways B. zonata could enter the Community, (c) conducting a detailed assessment of the climatic suitability of the EC for B. zonata, (d) defining which member states and areas are most endangered, (e) identifying the fruit species that are most at risk, (f) further exploring the potential impacts on export markets and (g) summarising the key uncertainties. The Spanish analysis of risk management options could also be enhanced since it (i) follows an old EPPO standard that contains a number of ambiguities and inconsistencies, (ii) does not analyse a key pathway (fresh fruit carried by passengers) in detail, (iii) rejects or fails to recognise several management options that, while insufficient on their own, could, when combined with others, form part of a systems approach, (iv) overlooks measures, such as surveillance trapping, the male annihilation technique and insecticides, that can be very effective in the importing country and (v) does not {{determine the extent to which}} the measures identified interfere with trade, are cost-effective and have no undesirable social or environmental consequences...|$|E
40|$|The European Commission {{requested}} the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{to provide a}} scientific opinion on the report “Mortality verification of pinewood nematode from high temperature treatment of shavings” provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The pinewood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner and Buhrer) Nickle, is listed in Community <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> <b>legislation</b> and protective measures include a requirement that wood shavings of coniferous wood (except that of Thuja L.) originating in the United States (US) must be heat treated to achieve a minimum core temperature of 56 °C for at least 30 minutes. The USDA, through the United Kingdom (UK) Authorities, {{requested the}} recognition of an alternative treatment by the European Community. The request {{was supported by a}} report of an experiment entitled "Mortality verification of pinewood nematode from high temperature treatment of shavings" and additional explanatory information. This report (and additional explanatory information) presents a treatment process whereby wood shavings are exposed to high temperatures (398 °C) for a short time (3 minutes). The report was submitted to EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Plant Health for evaluation with regard to the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed treatment method, {{as an alternative to the}} current heat treatment requirement. A scientific opinion was requested to assist risk managers in considering the technical justification for derogation from the current treatment requirement for wood shavings of coniferous wood listed in Annex IV, Part A, Section 1, point 1. 2 of the Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC[2]. The Panel examined the report and supporting information in detail and based its conclusions on the following:* An analysis of the cited references, and the extent to which they support the statements made in the introduction and discussion sections of the USDA report;* Evaluation of the materials, methods and results presented in the report and* A statistical analysis performed by the Panel to test the hypothesis of a mortality estimate after the heat treatment lower than 100 %. No comparison is made of the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed treatment method in relation to the current treatment requirement. The scope of this opinion is restricted to one species of Pinus “white pine” (Pinus strobus) as no wider species testing of other coniferous wood has been undertaken. Although the Panel is requested to consider the proposed treatment as an alternative to the current requirement for coniferous wood shavings, this extrapolation of the findings of the report cannot be made since no species other than white pine have been tested. According to the Panel, the references cited do not provide adequate evidence to support the effectiveness of the high temperature treatment proposed, are in some cases incorrectly interpreted and do not sufficiently validate the premise behind the treatment as stated in the USDA report. In particular, the relationship between lethal temperature and duration of exposure was not accurately established and no conclusion can, therefore, be derived about the appropriateness of the proposed temperature/time combination. The Panel considers that the accuracy of the results is difficult to assess due to missing data in the report for the control samples. The report claims that the treatment results in 100 % mortality, but a statistical analysis is not included in the report to specify the statistical level of confidence supporting these results. The Panel performed a statistical analysis of the data provided in the USDA report and cannot exclude that the mortality estimate is lower than 99. 85 %. Uncertainties relating to the experimental design are identified by the Panel. These include:* The effect of the high temperature treatment alone, independent of the shredding process cannot be derived from this experiment. * After the shredding process, shavings are expelled onto a mesh conveyer, which allows dust and particles to fall before the material enters the dryer. The possibility of B. xylophilus contamination from untreated waste material is not discussed. * Only one temperature-time combination has been tested. Therefore the safety margins and reliability of routine operational application of the proposed high temperature treatment cannot be derived from this experiment. This is noted as particularly important in relation to the short exposure time of 3 minutes proposed. * A temperature of 115 °C is recorded at the end of the high temperature treatment. Thus, a continuous exposure to 398 °C for 3 minutes cannot be confirmed from the experiment described. The Panel considers that several elements of the experiment were also not adequately described:* The temperature of the wood shavings in the experiment is unknown. Further information on temperature measurement and placement of thermal sensors would enable more accurate evaluation of the temperature exposure over time. * A number of factors that may influence the results of the experiment are unknown. These include: the volume of the wood shavings relative to the air volume inside the dryer, the homogeneity of the distribution of the shavings in the dryer and wood moisture levels at the start of the treatment. * No information is provided to confirm the identity and the frequency of occurrence of the most resistant life stages of B. xylophilus in the treated samples. The storage conditions of the control samples are unknown, which may affect the natural mortality over time. The Panel agrees that there is potential for development of an alternative treatment protocol based on exposure of wood shavings to high temperatures for a short duration. The Panel however, does not consider that the evidence presented in this report demonstrates the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed temperature/time regime as an alternative to the heat treatment requirement for coniferous wood shavings set out in Annex IV Part A Section I Point 1. 2. of Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC...|$|E
