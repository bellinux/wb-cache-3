50|$|The sky {{inside a}} <b>primary</b> <b>rainbow</b> is {{brighter}} than the sky outside of the bow. This is because each raindrop is a sphere and it scatters light over an entire circular disc in the sky. The radius of the disc depends on the wavelength of light, with red light being scattered over a larger angle than blue light. Over most of the disc, scattered light at all wavelengths overlaps, resulting in white light which brightens the sky. At the edge, the wavelength dependence of the scattering {{gives rise to the}} rainbow.|$|E
50|$|Rainbows can be {{observed}} whenever there are water drops {{in the air and}} sunlight shining from behind the observer at a low altitude angle. Because of this, rainbows are usually seen in the western sky during the morning and in the eastern sky during the early evening. The most spectacular rainbow displays happen when half the sky is still dark with raining clouds and the observer is at a spot with clear sky {{in the direction of the}} sun. The result is a luminous rainbow that contrasts with the darkened background. During such good visibility conditions, the larger but fainter secondary rainbow is often visible. It appears about 10° outside of the <b>primary</b> <b>rainbow,</b> with inverse order of colours.|$|E

5000|$|In Europe, Ibn al-Haytham's Book of Optics was {{translated}} into Latin and studied by Robert Grosseteste. His work on light was continued by Roger Bacon, who wrote in his Opus Majus of 1268 about experiments with light shining through crystals and water droplets showing the colours of the rainbow. In addition, Bacon {{was the first to}} calculate the angular size of the rainbow. He stated that the rainbow summit can not appear higher than 42° above the horizon. Theodoric of Freiberg is known to have given an accurate theoretical explanation of both the primary and secondary rainbows in 1307. He explained the <b>primary</b> <b>rainbow,</b> noting that [...] "when sunlight falls on individual drops of moisture, the rays undergo two refractions (upon ingress and egress) and one reflection (at the back of the drop) before transmission into the eye of the observer." [...] He explained the secondary rainbow through a similar analysis involving two refractions and two reflections.|$|E
5000|$|Secondary rainbows {{are caused}} by a double {{reflection}} of sunlight inside the raindrops, and are centred on the sun itself. They are about 127° (violet) to 130° (red) wide. Since {{this is more than}} 90°, they are seen {{on the same side of}} the sky as the <b>primary</b> <b>rainbow,</b> about 10° above it at apparent angles of 50-53°. As a result of the [...] "inside" [...] of the secondary bow being [...] "up" [...] to the observer, the colours appear reversed compared to the primary bow. The secondary rainbow is fainter than the primary because more light escapes from two reflections compared to one and because the rainbow itself is spread over a greater area of the sky. Each rainbow reflects white light inside its coloured bands, but that is [...] "down" [...] for the primary and [...] "up" [...] for the secondary. [...] The dark area of unlit sky lying between the primary and secondary bows is called Alexander's band, after Alexander of Aphrodisias who first described it.|$|E

40|$|This book {{discusses}} the effects, modeling, latest results, and nanotechnology applications of rainbows that appear during channeling of charged particles in crystals and nanotubes. The authors {{begin with a}} brief review of the optical and particle rainbow effects followed by a detailed description of crystal rainbows, which appear in ion channeling in crystals, and their modeling using catastrophe theory. The effects of spatial and angular focusing of channeled ions are described, with special attention given to the applications of the former effect to subatomic microscopy. The results of a thorough study of the recent high-resolution channeling experiments performed with protons of energies between 2. 0 and 0. 7 MeV and a 55 nm thick silicon crystal are also provided. This study opens up the potential for accurate analysis of very thin crystals. Also presented are recent results related to rainbows occurring in proton transmission through carbon nanotubes, and a detailed quantum consideration of the transmission of positrons of an energy of 1 MeV through very short carbon nanotubes. This process is determined by the rainbow effect. The initial positron beam is represented as an ensemble of non-interacting Gaussian wave packets, and the principal and supernumerary <b>primary</b> <b>rainbows</b> appearing in the spatial and angular distributions of transmitted positrons are clearly identified. They are explained by the effects of wrinkling, concentration and coordination of the wave packets...|$|R
5000|$|When {{sunlight}} {{encounters a}} raindrop, {{part of the}} light is reflected and the rest enters the raindrop. The light is refracted at {{the surface of the}} raindrop. When this light hits the back of the raindrop, some of it is reflected off the back. When the internally reflected light reaches the surface again, once more some is internally reflected and some is refracted as it exits the drop. (The light that reflects off the drop, exits from the back, or continues to bounce around inside the drop after the second encounter with the surface, is not relevant to the formation of the <b>primary</b> <b>rainbow.)</b> The overall effect is that part of the incoming light is reflected back over the range of 0° to 42°, with the most intense light at 42°. This angle is independent {{of the size of the}} drop, but does depend on its refractive index. Seawater has a higher refractive index than rain water, so the radius of a [...] "rainbow" [...] in sea spray is smaller than a true rainbow. This is visible to the naked eye by a misalignment of these bows.|$|E
5000|$|A single {{reflection}} off {{the backs}} of an array of raindrops produces a rainbow with an angular size on the sky that ranges from 40° to 42° with red on the outside. Double rainbows are produced by two internal reflections with angular size of 50.5° to 54° with violet on the outside. Within the [...] "primary rainbow" [...] (the lowest, and also normally the brightest rainbow) the arc of a rainbow shows red on the outer (or upper) part of the arc, and violet on the inner section. This rainbow is caused by light being reflected once in droplets of water. In a double rainbow, a second arc may be seen above and outside the primary arc, and has the order of its colors reversed (red faces inward toward the other rainbow, in both rainbows). This second rainbow is caused by light reflecting twice inside water droplets. The region between a double rainbow is dark. The reason for this dark band is that, while light below the <b>primary</b> <b>rainbow</b> comes from droplet reflection, and light above the upper (secondary) rainbow also comes from droplet reflection, there is no mechanism for the region between a double rainbow to show any light reflected from water drops, at all.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{a double}} rainbow that {{consists}} of two separate and concentric rainbow arcs, the very rare twinned rainbow appears as two rainbow arcs that split from a single base. The colours in the second bow, rather than reversing as in a secondary rainbow, appear {{in the same order}} as the <b>primary</b> <b>rainbow.</b> A [...] "normal" [...] secondary rainbow may be present as well. Twinned rainbows can look similar to, but {{should not be confused with}} supernumerary bands. The two phenomena may be told apart by their difference in colour profile: supernumerary bands consist of subdued pastel hues (mainly pink, purple and green), while the twinned rainbow shows the same spectrum as a regular rainbow.The cause of a twinned rainbow is the combination of different sizes of water drops falling from the sky. Due to air resistance, raindrops flatten as they fall, and flattening is more prominent in larger water drops. When two rain showers with different-sized raindrops combine, they each produce slightly different rainbows which may combine and form a twinned rainbow.A numerical ray tracing study showed that a twinned rainbow on a photo could be explained by a mixture of 0.40 and 0.45 mm droplets. That small difference in droplet size resulted in a small difference in flattening of the droplet shape, and a large difference in flattening of the rainbow top.|$|E
50|$|Alexander's band or Alexander's {{dark band}} is an optical {{phenomenon}} associated with rainbows which {{was named after}} Alexander of Aphrodisias who first described it in 200 AD. It occurs due to the deviation angles of the <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>rainbows.</b> Both bows exist due to an optical effect called the angle of minimum deviation. The refractive index of water prevents light from being deviated at smaller angles.|$|R

5000|$|The {{reason the}} {{returning}} light is most intense at about 42° {{is that this}} is a turning point - light hitting the outermost ring of the drop gets returned at less than 42°, as does the light hitting the drop nearer to its centre. There is a circular band of light that all gets returned right around 42°. If the sun were a laser emitting parallel, monochromatic rays, then the luminance (brightness) of the bow would tend toward infinity at this angle (ignoring interference effects). (See Caustic (optics).) But since the sun's luminance is finite and its rays are not all parallel (it covers about half a degree of the sky) the luminance does not go to infinity. Furthermore, the amount by which light is refracted depends upon its wavelength, and hence its colour. This effect is called dispersion. Blue light (shorter wavelength) is refracted at a greater angle than red light, but due to the reflection of light rays from the back of the droplet, the blue light emerges from the droplet at a smaller angle to the original incident white light ray than the red light. Due to this angle, blue is seen on the inside of the arc of the <b>primary</b> <b>rainbow,</b> and red on the outside. The result of this is not only to give different colours to different parts of the rainbow, but also to diminish the brightness. (A [...] "rainbow" [...] formed by droplets of a liquid with no dispersion would be white, but brighter than a normal rainbow.) ...|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the common <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>rainbows,</b> {{it is also possible}} for rainbows of higher orders to form. The order of a rainbow is determined by the number of light reflections inside the water droplets that create it: One reflection results in the first-order or primary rainbow; two reflections create the second-order or secondary rainbow. More internal reflections cause bows of higher orders—theoretically unto infinity. As more and more light is lost with each internal reflection, however, each subsequent bow becomes progressively dimmer and therefore increasingly harder to spot. An additional challenge in observing the third-order (or tertiary) and fourth-order (quaternary) rainbows is their location {{in the direction of the}} sun (about 40° and 45° from the sun, respectively), causing them to become drowned in its glare.|$|R
