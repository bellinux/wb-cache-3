2500|$|In {{addition}} the Selectric mechanism natively used {{a unique}} code {{based on the}} [...] "tilt/rotate" [...] commands to the golf ball. That and the bit-parallel interface and peculiar timing requirements meant the Selectric could not be directly {{hooked up to a}} modem. [...] Indeed, it needed a relatively large amount of logic to reconcile the two devices, and the interface logic often outweighed the <b>printing</b> <b>mechanism</b> in the early years.|$|E
2500|$|In 1967, a [...] "Magnetic Tape Selectric Composer" [...] appeared, and in 1978, a [...] "Magnetic Card Selectric Composer." [...] The [...] "Electronic Composer" [...] (with {{approximately}} 5000 {{characters of}} internal memory, {{similar to the}} later Magnetic Card model but without external storage) was marketed from 1975. All these models used the same Selectric Composer as output (<b>printing)</b> <b>mechanism.</b> However, due to the magnetic or internal storage, they avoided the need to type justified text twice or to manually set the mechanism for the justification needs of each line. [...] Furthermore, tapes or cards originally recorded on the much less expensive and easier to operate Selectric typewriter versions, the MT/ST or MC/ST, could be read by the [...] "Composer" [...] equivalents.|$|E
50|$|The 407 <b>print</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{was used}} in the IBM 716 {{introduced}} in 1952 with the IBM 701 computer, and the 716 was used with many machines in the IBM 700/7000 series. The 407 itself was adapted as an input/output unit on the IBM 650. Later, the 407 <b>print</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{was used in}} the IBM 1132 line printer, part of the low cost IBM 1130 computer system, introduced in 1965.|$|R

40|$|Crystalline silicon {{photovoltaic}} (PV) technology dominates 85 % of the PV share {{due to its}} ease {{process and}} manufacturing flow. Conventional silicon PV technology uses screen printing for the metallization and {{though most of the}} PV industries use this technique, it has its own limitations for fabricating solar cells of high efficiency beyond 19 %. However this technique is widely used in industries as a major process because of its production feasibility and cost compared to the alternate metallization techniques. In this article, an attempt has been made to study the different <b>printing</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> alternate to screen printing technique. Also, the process and results of alternate <b>printing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were interpreted and compared with screen printing technique. It is well understood that the PV industries looking for the cost effective advanced metallization technique for fabricating high efficiency solar cells. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|Like all IP-based protocols, IPP can run locally or {{over the}} Internet. Unlike other {{printing}} protocols, IPP also supports access control, authentication, and encryption, making it a much more capable and secure <b>printing</b> <b>mechanism</b> than older ones.|$|E
50|$|The IBM 421 {{accounting}} machine saw {{use in the}} 1960s. It accepted 80-column punch cards and its <b>printing</b> <b>mechanism</b> handled the upper-case letters of the alphabet, the decimal digits 0 to 9, a period (.), and plus and minus signs.|$|E
50|$|The IBM 046 Tape-to-Card Punch and the IBM 047 Tape-to-Card Printing Punch (which {{was almost}} identical, {{but with the}} {{addition}} of a <b>printing</b> <b>mechanism)</b> read data from punched paper tape and punched that data into cards. The IBM 063 Card-Controlled Tape Punch read punched cards, punching that data into paper tape.|$|E

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the {{commercial}} popularity of typewriters in the 1970s, a number of hybrid designs combining features of printers were introduced. [...] These often incorporated keyboards from existing models of typewriters and <b>printing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of dot-matrix printers. The generation of teleprinters with impact pin-based printing engines was not adequate for the demanding quality required for typed output, and alternative thermal transfer technologies used in thermal label printers had become technically feasible for typewriters.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the first}} {{rectilinear}} scanners was developed by Benedict Cassen in 1950. Before then hand-held detectors {{had been used to}} locate radioactive materials in patients, but the Cassen system (designed for Iodine-131) combined a motor driven photomultiplier tube and <b>printing</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Subsequent developments improved the detection systems, movement, display and printing of images.|$|E
50|$|Fialka {{contains}} a five-level paper tape reader {{on the right}} hand side {{at the front of}} the machine, and a paper tape punch and tape <b>printing</b> <b>mechanism</b> on top. The punched-card input for keying the machine is located on the left hand side. The Fialka requires 24 volt DC power and comes with a separate power supply that accepts power at 100 to 250 VAC, 50-400 Hz.|$|E
50|$|IBM 407Introduced in 1949, it {{was later}} adapted {{to serve as an}} input/output {{peripheral}} for a number of early electronic calculators and computers.

50|$|Dot matrix {{printing}} or impact {{matrix printing}} {{is a type}} of computer printing which uses a print head that moves back-and-forth, or in an up-and-down motion, on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like the <b>print</b> <b>mechanism</b> on a typewriter. However, unlike a typewriter or daisy wheel printer, letters are drawn out of a dot matrix, and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced.|$|R

5000|$|The ink must be heated, and a {{large portion}} of the <b>printing</b> <b>mechanism</b> must be kept at or near the ink's melting point during use. When the printer is in [...] "sleep mode", most units keep a small pool of each color wax within the {{printhead}} heated to a temperature just above the ink's [...] "freeze point". According to the Xerox service manual, this consumes about 50 watts.|$|E
5000|$|The 1132 {{was built}} around a {{stripped}} down IBM 407 <b>printing</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The 407 was IBM's top-of-the-line accounting machine from the 1950s. The 1130 had 120 power transistors, each wired to the print magnet for one printer column. The magnet released a lever that engaged a cam with a spinning clutch shaft. The engaged cam then made one revolution, pushing its print wheel toward the ribbon and paper, thereby printing one character.|$|E
50|$|In 1984, HP {{introduced}} both inkjet {{and laser}} printers for the desktop. Along with its scanner product line, these have later been developed into successful multifunction products, {{the most significant}} being single-unit printer/scanner/copier/fax machines. The <b>print</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in HP's tremendously popular LaserJet line of laser printers depend almost entirely on Canon Inc.'s components (print engines), which in turn use technology developed by Xerox. HP develops the hardware, firmware, and software that convert data into dots for the <b>mechanism</b> to <b>print.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to their use in heavy manufacturing equipment, single-revolution clutches were applied to numerous small machines. In tabulating machines, for example, pressing the operate key would trip a single revolution clutch to process the most recently entered number. [...] In typesetting machines, pressing any key selected a particular character and also engaged a single rotation clutch to cycle the mechanism to typeset that character. [...] Similarly, in teleprinters, the receipt of each character tripped a single-revolution clutch to operate one cycle of the <b>print</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|R
50|$|The LaserJet 4 Plus (4+), {{released}} in 1994, was the LaserJet 4 with the improved Canon EX+ engine which increased printing speed to 12 PPM. This also provided the option for duplex printing (automatic double-sided printing) with {{the purchase of}} an accessory (HP part number C3157A). The original 20 MHz processor was also upgraded to 25 MHz, {{with the addition of}} Hewlett Packard's Memory Enhancement Technology. The <b>printing</b> <b>mechanism</b> was also improved to allow increased tones of grayscale.|$|E
5000|$|Two years later, on June 11, 1889, he {{was granted}} a patent for the Comptograph. [...] A Comptograph is a comptometer with a <b>printing</b> <b>mechanism</b> making it more like a key-set calculating machine (even though the keys are {{registered}} as they are typed and not when a handle is pulled) therefore slower and more complicated to operate. It was the first printing-adding machine design to use individualized type impression which made its printed output very legible.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{different}} computer printers {{were simply}} computer-controllable versions of existing electric typewriters. The Friden Flexowriter and IBM Selectric-based printers were the most-common examples. The Flexowriter printed with a conventional typebar mechanism while the Selectric used IBM's well-known [...] "golf ball" [...] <b>printing</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In either case, the letter form then struck a ribbon which was {{pressed against the}} paper, printing one character at a time. The maximum speed of the Selectric printer (the faster of the two) was 15.5 characters per second.|$|E
50|$|A serial {{dot matrix}} printer {{is a type of}} {{computer}} printer with a print head that runs back and forth, or in an up and down motion, on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like the <b>print</b> <b>mechanism</b> on a typewriter. However, unlike a typewriter or daisy wheel printer, letters are drawn out of a dot matrix, and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced. Because the printing involves mechanical pressure, these printers can create carbon copies and carbonless copies.|$|R
50|$|In 1949 IBM {{introduced}} the IBM 407 Accounting Machine with a wheel <b>print</b> <b>mechanism</b> that could <b>print</b> 150 alphanumeric lines a minute. Each of the 120 print positions {{had its own}} type wheel which rotated under electromechanical control. Once all were in position, print hammers struck the wheels against a ribbon and the paper. The 407 or its wheel line printer mechanism was attached {{to a variety of}} early IBM computers, including the IBM 650, most members of the IBM 700/7000 series and the IBM 1130, the last introduced in 1965.|$|R
5000|$|The Electromatic {{typewriter}} patents {{document the}} use of pivoted spiral cams operating against a hard rubber drive roller to drive the <b>print</b> <b>mechanism.</b> [...] This was the foundation of essentially all later electric typewriters. The typewriter could be equipped with a [...] "remote control" [...] mechanism allowing one typewriter to control another or to record and play back typed data through a parallel data connection with one wire per typewriter key. [...] The electromatic tape perforator, used a wide tape, with punch position per key on the keyboard.|$|R
