40|$|Large size dried (LSD) spikes {{have been}} {{produced}} to fulfil the existing requirement for reliable and traceable isotopic reference materials for nuclear safeguards. A system to produce certified nuclear isotopic reference material as a U/Pu mixture {{in the form of}} large size dried spikes, comparable to those produced using traditional methods has been installed in collaboration with Nucomat, a company with a recognized reputation in design and development of integrated automated systems. The major components of the system are a robot, two balances, a dispenser and a drying unit fitted into a glove box. The robot is software driven and designed to control all movements inside the glove-box, to identify unambiguously the <b>penicillin</b> <b>vials</b> with a barcode reader, to dispense the LSD batch solution into the vials and to weigh the amount dispensed. The system functionality has been evaluated and the performance validated by comparing the results from a series of samples dispensed and weighed by the automated system with the results by manual substitution weighing. After applying the proper correction factors to the data from the automated system balance no significant difference was observed between the two. However, an additional component of uncertainty of 3 ¿ 10 - 4 is introduced in the uncertainty budget for the certified weights provided by the automatic system. JRC. DG.

40|$|IRMM Large-Sized Dried (LSD) Spikes are a {{fundamental}} {{part of the}} fissile material control of irradiated nuclear fuel, provided {{on a regular basis}} to safeguards authorities and industry for more than 10 years. This report describes the preparation and certification of a new batch of LSD Spikes. IRMM- 1027 o is a dried nitrate material in cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), certified for the mass of uranium and plutonium and isotope amount ratios per unit. The material was produced following ISO Guide 34 : 2009. The certified reference materials, uranium metal EC NRM 101, enriched uranium metal NBL CRM- 116 and plutonium metal CETAMA MP 2, were used as starting materials to prepare a synthetic nitrate solution. This solution was dispensed by means of an automated robot system into individual units (penicillin vials) and dried down. An organic material, cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), was dried on the spike material as a stabilizer to retain the dried material {{at the bottom of the}} <b>penicillin</b> <b>vial.</b> Between unit-homogeneity was quantified and stability during dispatch and storage were assessed in accordance with ISO Guide 35 : 2006. The certified values were obtained from the gravimetric preparation of the nitrate solution, taking into account the mass, purity and isotopic abundances of the starting materials, the mass of the nitrate solution, and the mass of an aliquot of a nitrate solution in individual unit. The certified values were confirmed by isotope dilution thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS) as independent confirmation method (measurements within the scope of accreditation to ISO/IEC 17025 : 2005). Uncertainties of the certified values were calculated in compliance with the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) and include uncertainties related to possible in homogeneity, and to characterisation. These spikes are applied to measure the uranium and plutonium amount content of dissolved fuel solutions using isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS). The CRM is available in penicillin vials, each containing about 50 mg of uranium with a 235 U relative mass fraction of 19. 3 % and 1. 9 mg of plutonium with a 239 Pu relative mass fraction of 97. 8 % as dried nitrate in CAB. The whole amount of sample per unit has to be used for analysis. JRC. D. 4 -Standards for Nuclear Safety, Security and Safeguard...|$|E

40|$|Large Scale Dried (LSD) spikes {{are used}} in nuclear {{safeguards}} laboratories world-wide for an accurate Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometric (IDMS) determination of physical nuclear material inventories, with relative uncertainties for U and Pu of better than 0. 28 % (k= 1). IDMS fully relies on the mechanical integrity of the spikes. The spikes need to be robust during transport and storage for their guaranteed life-time of 3 years. Mechanically damaged spikes are no longer fit for purpose (ISO-guide 34 on "General requirements for the competence of reference material producers"). LSD spikes are produced by dispensing accurately-weighed quantities of a nuclear material reference solution into <b>penicillin</b> <b>vials,</b> after which the solution is evaporated to dryness. Some commercially available spikes are additionally covered with an organic coating to prevent unintented losses of nuclear material when the spike vials are opened for use. The main requirements for such coatings are good adherence to glass, mechanical stability, resistance to radiation and long term stability. Furthermore, the coating should readily dissolve in nitric acid and should not interfere with chromatographic chemical separation and subsequent mass spectrometric measurements. JRC-ITU carried out research and development to improve on traditional coatings based on Cellulose Acetate Butyrate (CAB) that is used in spikes such as JRC-IRMM 1027. CarboxyMethyl Cellulose Sodium Salt (CMC) is proposed {{as an alternative to}} current CAB coatings that fail to offer the desired shelf-life. In the JRC-ITU procedure, CMC is dissolved in water, changed to a nitrate form with a high viscosity and added to spike vials containing the dried deposits of nuclear reference material. After warming, the CMC forms foam that is extremely robust to mechanical impact and appears to have a long shelf-life. The CMC foam coatings were scrutinized by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) and preliminary IDMS studies indicate that CMC does not interfere with IDMS assays. CMC appears to be a promising coating material for LSD spikes. JRC. E. 7 -Nuclear Safeguards and Forensic...|$|R
40|$|Large sized dried spikes (LSD) are a {{fundamental}} {{part of the}} fissile material control of irradiated nuclear fuel. They are applied to measure the uranium and plutonium content of dissolved fuel solutions from reprocessing plants using isotope dilution mass-spectrometry (IDMS). Since the first batch of LSDs was produced, the concept of directly spiking samples of the solution with dissolved irradiated nuclear fuel for later dilution and measurement of the isotopic contents of uranium and plutonium has been developed successfully. In the method employed at IRMM, very high quality isotopically enriched metals of uranium (natural and high-enriched) and plutonium are dissolved into a single large solution in nitric acid. Individual spikes are then made by aliquoting weighed amounts of the solution into <b>penicillin</b> <b>vials</b> and drying carefully. A light cellulose layer is dried on the spike material to retain the spike {{at the bottom of}} the vial during transport to where it will be used. The spikes are prepared in large batches (1000 units) under rigorous conditions. Each spike then has a certified mass of uranium (235 U and 238 U) and 239 Pu with an associated uncertainty derived by a rigorous procedure (following the GUM) from the measured and certified parameters of all starting materials and solutions. The plutonium component is highly enriched in 239 Pu and is used to measure the Pu content in the fuel. The uranium component is a mixture of two uranium source materials, natural uranium and a highly enriched uranium component. These materials are mixed to arrive at a final enrichment of just under 20 % in 235 U, significantly simplifying transport and handling of the spikes. A series of verification measurements are carried out during the process and the final spikes are certified from the masses of the metal starting materials, the certified assay (purity) values of uranium and plutonium in the starting materials, the mass of the solution, the mass aliquoted into each vial and the isotopic abundances of each of the starting materials.
