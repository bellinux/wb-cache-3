40|$|AIM: To {{measure the}} normal {{space between the}} {{posterior}} wall of the vagina and the anterior wall of the respectively rectum using computed tomography (CT) and reveal its were relationship to rectocele. METHODS: A total of twenty female volunteers without rectocele were examined by CT scan. We performed a middle level continuous horizontal <b>pelvic</b> <b>scan</b> from the upper part to the lower part and collected the measurement data to analyze the results using t-test. RESULTS: Twenty volunteers {{were enrolled in the}} study. The space between the posterior wall of the vagina and the anterior wall of the rectum was measured at three levels (upper 1 / 3, middle, lower 1 / 3 level of vagina). The results showed that the space from the posterior wall of the vagina to the anterior wall of the rectum at the upper 1 / 3 level and the middle level was 3. 896 ± 0. 3617 mm and 4. 6575 ± 0. 3052 mm, respectively. When the two groups of data were compared, we found the space at the upper 1 / 3 level was shorter than at the middle level (P < 0. 01).

40|$|Abstract Introduction A {{collision}} tumor is {{the meeting}} and eventual intermingling of two malignant neoplasms arising from independent topographical sites. Collision metastasis of carcinomas in the lymph nodes is a rare event. A literature search revealed only three cases of such a collision metastasis of prostatic and urothelial carcinoma, and only {{one of those cases}} had used immunohistochemical stains to distinguish the two tumors. Case presentation We encountered a case of this rare entity in an 83 -year-old African-American man who presented to our facility with increasing pelvic pain after a transurethral resection of a high-grade bladder tumor and a negative metastatic computed tomography chest, abdomen and <b>pelvic</b> <b>scan</b> investigation. A radical cystoprostatectomy was subsequently performed revealing a multi-centric, high-grade, ill-defined infiltrating urothelial carcinoma infiltrating the right pericystic soft tissue. A histopathological examination of the prostate revealed a multi-centric adenocarcinoma (Gleason 4 [*]+[*] 4) involving two pelvic lymph nodes. Interestingly, while the right pelvic lymph node was positive for metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma alone, immunohistochemical studies of the left pelvic lymph node revealed a dual metastatic urothelial (cytokeratin- 7 and pan-cytokeratin positive, prostate-specific antigen and cytokeratin- 20 negative) and prostatic (prostate-specific antigen and pan-cytokeratin positive, cytokeratin- 7 and cytokeratin- 20 negative) carcinoma. Conclusions The collision of metastatic urothelial carcinoma and prostatic adenocarcinoma is unusual, and their biological behavior remains uncertain. A high index of suspicion along with thorough clinical examination and immunohistochemical stain results {{are an integral part of}} differentiating collision of urothelial carcinoma from prostate carcinoma, particularly when the two tumors are in close proximity with overlapping histological features. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: (a) To {{establish}} the cut-off levels for anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) {{in a population}} of Indian women that would determine poor response. (b) To determine which among the three ie.,: age, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), or AMH, is the better determinant of ovarian reserve. Study Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: In vitro fertilization (IVF) unit of a tertiary hospital. Materials and Methods: The inclusion criterion was all women who presented to the center for in-vitro fertilization/Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI). The exclusion criteria were age > 45 years, major medical illnesses precluding IVF or pregnancy, FSH more than 20 IU/L, and failure to obtain consent. The interventions including baseline <b>pelvic</b> <b>scan,</b> day 2 / 3 FSH, luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol estimations, and AMH measurement on any random day of cycle were done. Subjects underwent IVF according to long agonist or antagonist protocol regimen. Oocyte recovery was correlated with studied variables. The primary outcome measure {{was the number of}} oocytes aspirated (OCR). Three categories of ovarian response were defined: poor response, OCR ≤ 3; average response, OCR between 4 and 15; hyperresponse, OCR > 15. Results: Of the 198 patients enrolled, poor, average, and hyperresponse were observed in 23 %, 63 %, and 14 % respectively. Correlation coefficient for AMH with ovarian response was r = 0. 591. Area under the curve (AUCs) for poor response for AMH, subject′s age, and FSH were 0. 768, 0. 624, and 0. 635, respectively. The discriminatory level of AMH for prediction of absolute poor response was 2 pmoL/l, with 98 % specificity and 20 % sensitivity. Conclusions: AMH fares better than age and FSH in predicting the overall ovarian response and poor response, though it cannot be the absolute predictor of non-responder status.

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} dose from kilovoltage cone beam CT to {{pediatric}} patients undergoing image‐guided radiation therapy and {{to compare the}} dose between standard and low dose protocols. Methods: Imaging dose to several pediatric patients undergoing image‐guided radiation therapy, and methods to reduce it, have been assessed using a treatment planning system (TPS) and Monte Carlo (MC). The imaging dose from an Elekta XVI kVCBCT system {{has been added to}} the treatment plans to calculate total dose to patients. The maximum dose and its location, dose to isocenter and various organs, and its correlation with patient size and body mass index (BMI), have been analyzed. The calculations have been performed using standard imaging protocols and low dose and/or modified ones. The TPS calculations have been supplemented with MC to assess the dose to bone and skin which cannot be accurately calculated using the TPS. Results: Employing a lower dose imaging technique for pediatric patients by: 1) Choosing a pre‐set imaging protocol using a lower technique that may be designated for a different anatomic region, i. e. using the Head and Neck protocol on a <b>pelvic</b> <b>scan,</b> or 2) Modifying a standard imaging protocol by reducing the mAs or number of frames, could substantially reduce the imaging dose. The image quality of the lower dose techniques {{has been found to be}} acceptable for patient position verification.

40|$|Background: Dysfunctional uterine {{bleeding}} {{is a form}} {{of abnormal}} uterine bleeding when there is absence of organic disease of the genital tract. The objective {{of this study was to}} find out the clinical and pathological aspect of women presenting with dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Materials and Methods: A descriptive study was conducted over a period of one year from April 14 th 2010 to April 13 th 2011 in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Department of Pathology, Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal. A complete history, clinical examination, <b>pelvic</b> <b>scan,</b> hormonal status if required and endometrial biopsy were done to diagnose dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Results: A total of 120 cases were included. The age of the patients diagnosed dysfunctional uterine bleeding were ranging from 24 - 63 years. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding was most common in the age group 40 - 44 yrs (30 %) followed by 45 - 49 yrs (27. 5 %). Menorrhagia (41. 7 %) was the most common presenting sign. Majority histopathology of endometrium revealed anovulatory pattern (61. 7 %) followed by ovulatory (38. 3 %). Of the cases with an anovulatory pattern 48. 6 % was proliferative endometrium, 33. 8 % disordered proliferative endometrium, 6. 8 %atrophic, 5. 4 % weakly proliferative and 2. 7 % each of simple hyperplasia without atypia and complex hyperplasia with atypia. All cases with ovulatory pattern showed secretory endometrium. Conclusion: Dysfunctional uterine bleeding was the most common in the perimenopausal age group and chiefly in the form of an anovulatory endometrium.. Histopathological evaluation of endometrium helps exclude the local causes and establishes the diagnosis of dysfunctional uterine bleeding, its types, and clinical correlation to histopathological findings and finally helps to determine the mode of management.

40|$|Antibody-guided lymphangiography in {{the staging}} of {{cervical}} cancer Sir-We {{read with interest}} the report on antibody guided lymphangiography in the staging of cervical cancer (Epenetos, 1985). The author reports the occurrence of non specific isotope uptake by pelvic lymph nodes in patients presented {{to be free of}} nodal metastasis (as judged by concomitant X-ray lymphangiography). Non specific antibody binding through the Fc portion of the immunoglobulin was postulated as the cause of this phenomenon. We would suggest, however, that the effect may be partly explained by the presence of X-ray contrast medium in the lymphatics. We have performed similar antibody studies using a polyclonal anti CEA antibody linked to iodine 131. Figure 1 illustrates the gamma camera image of the anterior pelvis 24 h following injection of labelled antibody in a patient with Stage Ib carcinoma of the cervix. There is a difference between {{the two sides of the}} pelvis on this scan with small discrete areas of uptake on the right but broader more diffuse areas of uptake on the left. Subsequent pelvic lymphadenectomy revealed no evidence of lymph node metastases. Standard bipedal X-ray lymphangiography had been performed in this case but technical problems had prevented an adequate infusion of Lipiodol into the lymphatics of the right leg and this fact may explain the asymmetry seen on the antibody guided scan. This is compatible with the known occurrence of lymph node enlargement and lymphatic stasis following lymphangiography with lipid soluble contrast medium (Spitalier et al., 1967; Wallace et al., 1979).

40|$|Purpose: A biomechanical {{model was}} {{constructed}} to {{give insight into}} pelvic organ motion {{as a result of}} bladder filling changes. Methods: The authors used finite element (FE) modeling to simulate bladder wall deformation caused by urine inflow. For ten volunteers, a series of MRI scans of the pelvic area was recorded at regular intervals of 10 min over 1 h. For the series of scans, the bladder volume gradually increased while the rectal volume was constant. The MR image with the bladder volume closest to 250 ml was selected as the reference in each volunteer. All pelvic structures were defined from the reference image including bladder wall, small bowel, prostate (male), uterus (female), rectum, pelvic bone, {{and the rest of the}} body. These structures were translated to FE meshes. Using appropriate material properties for all organs, deformations of these organs as a response to changing bladder pressure were computed. Results: The computation results showed realistic anisotropic deformation of the bladder wall: The bladder became more elongated in the cranial and anterior directions with increasing bladder volume. After fitting the volume of the computed bladder to the actual bladder volume on the test images, the computed bladder shape agreed well with the real bladder shape (overlap from 0. 79 to 0. 93). The average mean bladder wall prediction errors of all the volunteers were 0. 31 cm average and 0. 29 cm SD. Conclusions: In conclusion, a FE based mechanical bladder model shows promise for the prediction of the short-term bladder shape change using only one <b>pelvic</b> <b>scan</b> and volume change of the bladder as input. The accuracy levels achieved with this method are likely mostly limited by inaccuracies in material properties and sliding tissue between organs, which has not been modeled. This model can potentially be used to improve image-guided radiotherapy for bladder cancer patients, i. e., by prediction short-term bladder deformation.

40|$|Hysterosalpingography (HSG) is a {{commonly}} performed investigation for infertility work-up, {{to assess the}} uterine cavity and tubal patency. The commonest indication for HSG is infertility, which could be primary or secondary. Historically, HSG was originally used for diagnosis of pregnancy. Hauser reported the first clinical HSG application for diagnosis of early pregnancy Miller and Martinz reported their results of HSG in 15 pregnant women, performed by intrauterine injection of 10 15 milliliters of Lipiodol with three miscarriages, {{which led to the}} discouragement of the procedure. The published reports of unsuspected pregnancies during HSG have been very few. Justesen et al reported a prevalence rate of 0. 06 %, which was four cases of pregnancy out of 6, 225 HSGs Jongen et al and Cheung et al. reported one and three such cases respectively. Meamarzadeh et al. reported six cases out of over 63000 HSGs done during the authors 30 years practice, in spite of taking safety measures. The dangers of HSG in unsuspected pregnancy are disruption of pregnancy, displacement of the fertilized ovum into the uterine tube (ectopic pregnancy) or peritoneal cavity and mutative effects of radiation on the developing fetus. Previous reports have advocated various ways to prevent unsuspected pregnancy during HSG, which include; (1) The “ 10 day ” rule, which means performing the procedure within 10 days of the last menstrual date. (2) Performing a pregnancy test prior to the procedure.

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess organ and effective doses resulting from new CBCT scan protocols (head, thorax, and pelvis) released with a software upgrade of the kV on-board-imager (OBI) system. Influence of the scan parameters that were changed in the new protocols on the patient dose was also investigated. Organ and effective doses for protocols of the new software (V 2. 5) and a previous version (V 1. 6) were assessed using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) adult male and female reference computational phantoms. The number of projections and the mAs values were increased and the size of the scan field was extended in the new protocols. Influence of these changes on organ and effective doses of the scans was investigated. The OBI system was modelled in EGSnrc/BEAMnrc, and organ doses were estimated using EGSnrc/DOSXYZnrc. The MC model was benchmarked against experimental measurements. Organ doses resulting from the V 2. 5 protocols were higher than those of V 1. 6 for organs that were partially or fully inside the scans fields, and increased by (3 to 13) %, (10 to 77) %, and (13 to 21) % for the head, thorax, and pelvis protocols for both phantoms, respectively. As a result, effective doses rose by 14 %, 17 %, and 16 % for the male phantom, and 13 %, 18 %, and 17 % for the female phantom for the three scan protocols, respectively. The scan field extension for the V 2. 5 protocols contributed significantly in the dose increases, especially for organs that were partially irradiated such as the thyroid in head and thorax scans and colon in the <b>pelvic</b> <b>scan.</b> The contribution of the mAs values and projection numbers was minimal in the dose increases, up to 2. 5 %. The field size extension plays a major role in improving the treatment output by including more markers in the field of view to match between CBCT and CT images and hence setting up the patient precisely. Therefore, a trade-off between the risk and benefits of CBCT scans should be considered, and the dose increases should be monitored.

30|$|Our group {{reported}} {{a case of}} a patient with secondary infertility who had bits of fetal skull bone partially embedded all along the endometrial cavity for 7  years after an aspirotomy done for missed abortion [5]. Mrs. S. P., a 28 -year-old patient, gravida 1, para 0 with one missed abortion (aspirotomy in January 1989), presented on 3 July 1995 with the complaint of secondary infertility for 7  years. She had previously been seen in two other clinics for irregular menstruation since her missed abortion 7  years ago. Menarche was at 13  years of age, and menstrual periods had been regular and normal until her aspirotomy done for missed abortion. In that confinement she was first examined at 7  months amenorrhea and was referred for an urgent USG because the uterus was much smaller than per period of gestation. USG revealed a missed abortion corresponding to 16  weeks gestational size. An elective aspirotomy was then performed upon her. After her aspirotomy she was suffered from menometrorraghia with spotting/bleeding free intervals of 10 – 12  days. She had been treated repeatedly over the last 7  years with hormonal therapy. She had undergone a D+C 4  years ago, and the histopathology revealed proliferative endometrium. She presented on 3 July 1995 with severe bleeding, and a diagnostic cum therapeutic curettage was performed upon her on 4 July 1995, which again revealed a histopathologic diagnosis of proliferative endometrium. A diagnosis of dysfunctional uterine bleeding secondary to anovulatory cycles was made, and it was planned to give her a single cycle of ovulation induction to check if she responded to clomiphene citrate. Semen analysis of the male partner was normal. She was referred for routine follicular studies on day 8 of her subsequent menstrual cycle following ovarian stimulation with 50  mg clomiphene citrate administered from 02 – 06 (Siphene, Serum Institute of India Limited, Bombay, India). Transvaginal sonography was performed, and the <b>pelvic</b> <b>scan</b> revealed a normal-sized anteverted uterus, which measured 6.3 × 5.4 x 4.6  cm. Both the ovaries were normal in size, position and echotexture and revealed multiple small follicles. On sagittal view (Fig.  5), the area of the endometrial stripe revealed a hyperechogenic shadow that extended all along the uterine cavity. The endometrial morphology could not be made out. On coronal view (Fig.  6), the scan again revealed a hyperechogenic shadow with acoustic backscatter in the region of the endometrial cavity. This was suggestive of calcified material in the uterine cavity. A diagnosis of prolonged intrauterine retention of fetal bones after abortion was made, and the patient was posted for hysteroscopy 2  days later. The day following the transvaginal sonographic diagnosis, a plain X-ray of the pelvis was taken. The X-ray revealed a small indistinct radio-opaque area in the region of the uterus. A diagnostic hysteroscopy was performed, revealing small (1 – 6  mm) bone fragments (supposedly skull bone), which were lightly embedded all over the cavity, extending from the fundal region, both periosteal regions and {{the lower part of the}} uterine cavity. A resectoscope (Karl Storz GmBH, Tuttlingen, Germany and Chimco Biomedical, Bombay, India) was introduced, and the fragments were dislodged with gentle maneuvering and were removed under hysteroscopic video control. An endocamera (DX-CAM, Karl Storz GmBH, Tuttlingen, Germany and Chimco Biomedical, Bombay, India) was used to monitor the entire procedure, which was recorded on videocassette for documentation purposes. The hysteroscope was reintroduced to document that the cavity was clean after attempts at bone removal were completed. A total of 11 small (1 – 6  mm) bone fragments (supposedly skull bone) (Fig.  7) were removed and sent for histopathologic diagnosis, which confirmed our findings.|$|E

Material and method: The group consisted of 38 adolescent girls with anorexia nervosa diagnosed acc. to ICD- 10 criteria – mean age 14. 3 ± 2. 1 years, mean age at the beginning of AN symptoms 13 ± 2. 3 years, mean BMI 14 ± 1. 6 kg/m 2. On initial assessment, all girls underwent physical examination, clinical interview concerning AN symptoms and <b>pelvic</b> ultrasound <b>scanning.</b> Results: Sixteen patients (42 %) had primary amenorrhea. In 32 % of patients cessation of menses occurred before a significant decrease in weight. Ovarian and uterine volumes significantly below the expected were found in 11 and 15 patients with secondary amenorrhea, respectively. The varian and uterine maturity was related to shorter duration of amenorrhea and longer duration of adequate menstruation before the onset of AN. There were no BMI differences between the groups with more and less mature ultrasound picture...|$|R

30|$|Further investigations, {{including}} barium enema, follow-through and colonoscopy {{to exclude}} chronic inflammatory bowel disorders and malignancy were all negative. A <b>pelvic</b> ultrasound <b>scan</b> was normal {{and a second}} opinion at the Gynaecological Cancer centre excluded any other diagnosis. Consequently, a diagnosis of vaginal ulceration, most likely secondary to tampon use, was made.|$|R
50|$|Diagnosis of {{anorectal}} abscess {{begins with a}} medical history and physical exam. Imaging studies which can help determine the diagnosis in cases of a deep non-palpable perirectal abscess include <b>pelvic</b> CT <b>scan,</b> MRI or trans-rectal ultrasound. These studies are not necessary, though, in cases which the diagnosis can be made upon physical exam.|$|R
30|$|After {{consultation}} with a tertiary referral centre for gynaecological oncology, {{a decision to}} manage this case conservatively was reached. The patient will be followed up in the outpatient clinic at six-monthly intervals for at least 5  years. These visits will involve a physical examination, a <b>pelvic</b> ultrasound <b>scan,</b> and measurement of serum Ca 125 levels.|$|R

The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was considered unlikely after assessment by the surgical discipline {{but could not}} be completely ruled out. <b>Pelvic</b> ultrasound <b>scan</b> during acute admission confirmed {{the presence of the}} previously seen ovarian cyst with some free fluid in the Pouch of Douglas.|$|R

Laparoscopy may provide an alternative means of diagnosis when conventional imaging fails, and may facilitate the placement of catheters for subsequent intraperitoneal therapy...|$|R
