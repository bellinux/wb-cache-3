5000|$|In the United States, {{gasoline-powered}} {{lawn mowers}} were first manufactured in 1914 by Ideal <b>Power</b> <b>Mower</b> Co. of Lansing, Michigan, {{based on a}} patent by Ransom E. Olds. Ideal <b>Power</b> <b>Mower</b> also introduced the world's first self-propelled, riding lawn tractor in 1922, known as the [...] "Triplex". The roller-drive lawn mower has changed very little since around 1930. Gang mowers, those with multiple sets of blades to cut a wider swath, {{were built in the}} United States in 1919 by the Worthington Mower Company.|$|E
50|$|In 1934, the {{original}} Lawn-Boy lawn mower was manufactured by the Evinrude Company, {{becoming the first}} one-handed reel <b>power</b> <b>mower</b> introduced to the American public. Evinrude purchased Johnson Motor Wheel Company from a New York stock brokerage firm a year later, and in 1936 they merged with the Outboard Marine and Manufacturing Company (OMC), continuing production of Lawn-Boy mowers until 1939, when it was temporarily put on hold to manufacture outboard motors for World War II. In 1946 and after the war, Joel G. (Jack) Doyle built the first rotary lawnmower for the Rotary <b>Power</b> <b>Mower</b> Company of Kansas City, Missouri. Doyle accumulated orders for these mowers from Sears Roebuck, Gimbles, Spiegel, and other businesses. OMC then bought RPM in 1952, and changed the brand of the rotary lawn mower to the Lawn-Boy name.|$|E

50|$|During the Red Scare {{following}} World War I, {{the fort}} {{served as a}} temporary detention center for accused communists awaiting trial. In 1921, the world's first motorized ride-on lawn mower, patented by Ransom E.

During the Great Depression, the fort was opened to homeless families and it housed the Civilian Conservation Corps".|$|E
5000|$|In 1951, Mervyns son Garry mowed lawns to {{earn money}} in {{university}} holidays. Garry borrowed Mervyns Victa 14" [...] cylinder-based <b>power</b> <b>mower</b> which was heavy to transport and to operate. Mervyn wanted to design a new mower for his sons business. Mervyn had seen Lawrence Halls Mowhall rotary lawn mower demonstrated in 1948. The heavy Mowhall {{was not a very}} successful invention because it required two people to use it, one to push and one to pull.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of turfgrass on airports, athletic fields, cemeteries, church grounds, golf courses, industrial lawns, parks, roadsides and school grounds has become well recognized in modern agriculture. These areas cover an estimated 13, 450, 100 {{acres in the}} United States. A total of $ 2, 892, 800, 000 is spent annually for growing and maintaining the grass i n these locations. Turf managers and homeowners also spend over $ 80, 000, 000 for pest killers and buy 4, 000, 000 <b>power</b> <b>mowers</b> every year. Fine turf is a valuable landscape commodity and compares in economic importance with our major field crops...|$|R
50|$|By October 1967, OMC's fiscal year-end sales {{had reached}} $233.4 million. Of this amount, 10 percent came from <b>power</b> <b>mowers,</b> with golf carts and utility {{vehicles}} sharing second place at 7 percent, and with snowmobiles, the fastest-growing {{segment of the}} business, also at 7 percent. Chain saw sales accounted for 4 percent of the final figure, while a full 70 percent came from marine products. The only failure of the decade was the boat-building enterprise; initially small operating losses grew each year, until the line was sold to Chris-Craft in 1970. Otherwise, the 1960s had been lucrative, as the 1969 net sales figure of $327.1 million showed.|$|R
50|$|Several {{acquisitions}} {{broadened the}} Outboard product line during the 1950s. The first, in 1952, was RPM Manufacturing Company of Missouri, whose specialty was a rotary <b>power</b> <b>mower</b> that Outboard planned to sell under its familiar Lawn-Boy tradename. Featuring a detachable engine useful as an outboard, the mower {{was already a}} best-selling unbranded item in both the Sears and the Spiegel catalogs. Outboard coped with the huge volume of existing orders by completing entire units in one factory, rather than using the more time-consuming method of piecemeal assembly in several locations.|$|E

Vardag och fest på Krapperups gods 1881 – 1995 English title: In {{the shadow}} of a castle. Everyday life and parties at the Krapperup Estate in 1881 – 1995 Author: Lillemor Nyström Language: Swedish, with an English summary Department: Department of Cultural Sciences, Box 200, SE- 405 30 Göteborg In {{the shadow of}} a castle. Everyday life and parties at the Krapperup Estate in 1881 – 1995 The {{purpose of this study is}} to problematize and analyze the everyday work as well as the celebrations which was held for the employees of the goods and the gentry’s own celebrations. The transformation from an entailed estate, with many employees and manual agricultural gear, to a modern agriculture with few employees as depicted over a long period of time. The Estate is also a cultural centre and distributes research grants. The dissertation is based on archival material and interviews with 33 informants, 17 men and 16 women born between 1904 and 1978. A documentary film recorded on Krapperup in the early 1940 s is also used. Krapperups estate, located in the north-west Scania, originating in the 1400 century. The estate was founded in 1755 and the Foundation was formed in 1967. Around 60 underlying tenant farms belonging to the estate. The theoretical part is based on Bruno Latour’s thoughts about the world as indivisible, where the whole is the sum of the parts. This means that materiality, non-human actants, are equivalent to human actants. This approach makes the scenes can be created by events that played out on the castle and on the farm. Even Irving Goffman’s approach has contributed to the creation of the scenes. To analyze the gentry flavor has Pierre Bourdieu and his concept of habitus has been used. The thesis shows how hierarchies, power and resistance looked like and also shows that a change over time occurred regarding the coexistence of family Gyllenstierna and staff. Both men and women worked as farm labourers but the women were referred to the simple and manual gear, never mechanized tool. They was milking the cows as long as the estate don’t invested in milking machines but when the do they instead had to washing the milk vessels and feeding the animals. Not until 1970 s the woman was aloud to drive a <b>power</b> <b>mower.</b> Keywords: Estate, Krapperup, entailed estate, foundation, downstairs/upstairs, parties, Gyllenstierna, gentlefolk, farm labourer, in-kind wage, class, gender, power, resistance, actor-network-theory, ANT, black box, translation, network. 312 pp. Language: Swedish, with an English summary Dept. of Cultural Sciences / University of Gothenburg / P.

40|$|Across the United States, it is {{estimated}} that turf grass lawns cover 62, 500 square miles of ground—more than 31 times the size of Delaware! Most lawns are simply too big to be useful, with high maintenance costs, minimal wildlife value, low aesthetic interest, and negative environmental impact. Though our obsession with immaculate expanses of grass has been long in the making, it is not too late to change. Why are there so many turf grass lawns? Some people speculate that the American infatuation with mowed lawns stems back to our ancestral beginnings in the savannahs of Africa, where lower grass provided open sight lines to lurking predators. More recently, in the eighteenth century, close-cut lawns became a symbol of wealth in Europe, a practice that made its way across the Atlantic by the 1800 s. Not only did rich landowners have the hired help required to maintain the lawn before the advent of power tools, but they had the luxury of dedicating a parcel of their land—often tamed at great expense—to something as frivolous as a non-food crop. Lawns really became all the rage in the 1950 s, when the post-World War II American Dream of a owning a house in the suburbs melded with widespread availability of <b>power</b> <b>mowers...</b>|$|R
