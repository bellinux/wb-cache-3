40|$|High {{efficiency}} polymer-fullerene bulk heterojunction organic {{solar cells}} can generate photocurrent by excitation {{of the electron}} donor and acceptor components via Channel I and Channel II processes, respectively. Using a planar Photo-Field-Effect-Transistor (<b>PhotoFET)</b> architecture operated in steady state and quasi-transient modes we have studied the dynamics of charge generation and transport in blends of PCDTBT/ 70 -PCBM (poly[N- 9 ′-heptadecanyl- 2, 7 -carbazole-alt- 5, 5 -{ 4 ′, 7 ′-di- 2 -thienyl- 2 ′, 1 ′, 3 ′-benzothiadiazole}]/[6, 6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methylester). The <b>PhotoFET</b> architecture allows independent measurement of the electron and hole photocurrents and mobilities for charge carriers generated by the Channel I (electron transfer) and Channel II (hole transfer) processes {{as a function of}} fullerene content. We find dramatic increases in the photocurrent yield and electron mobility with higher 70 -PCBM loading. By analyzing the External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) in n- and p-PhotoFET modes, we estimate that 80 – 90 % of the photocurrent generated in the optimum 1 : 4 (polymer/fullerene) blend is derived from fullerene absorption and hole transfer, that is, Channel II...|$|E
25|$|A {{phototransistor}} is a light-sensitive transistor. A {{common type}} of phototransistor, called a photobipolar transistor, is in essence a bipolar transistor encased in a transparent case so that light can reach the base–collector junction. It was invented by Dr. John N. Shive (more famous for his wave machine) at Bell Labs in 1948, {{but it was not}} announced until 1950. The electrons that are generated by photons in the base–collector junction are injected into the base, and this photodiode current is amplified by the transistor's current gain β (or hfe). If the base and collector leads are used and the emitter is left unconnected, the phototransistor becomes a photodiode. While phototransistors have a higher responsivity for light they are not able to detect low levels of light any better than photodiodes. Phototransistors also have significantly longer response times. Field-effect phototransistors, also known as <b>photoFETs,</b> are light-sensitive field-effect transistors. Unlike photobipolar transistors, <b>photoFETs</b> control drain-source current by creating a gate voltage.|$|R

The devices were characterized both in under dark showing n-type transistor behaviour with linear and saturated mobility of 1. 7 x 10 - 3 cm 2 /Vs and 2. 7 x 10 - 2 cm 2 /Vs respectively, and under white light illumination condition, where large {{shifts in the}} threshold voltage in the transfer characteristics were obtained.

40|$|Now organic {{thin film}} {{transistor}} technology gains growing maturity, high performance organic photodetectors are the missing link towards full organic photosensitive sensor arrays, needed for the realization of applications like organic scanners and organic cameras. In the borderline of the research in organic solar cells, research in organic photodetectors has mainly been limited to organic photodiodes. However, phototransistors offer the possibility to reach higher sensitivities, thanks to the internal current gain of a transistor structure. This document focuses on organic field-effect phototransistors (organic photoFETs) where illumination {{can be used as}} an optical gate signal in addition to the electrical gate signal. An experimental description of pentacene photoFETs during broadband illumination is given. A distinction between the direct photocurrent and the additional current enhancement by a thresholdshift can be made, and a relation for this thresholdshift in function of time is revealed. Consequently, the difficulty to compare different organic photoFETs without any information about the illumination time is highlighted and a comparison based on this power law is proposed. Subsequently it is pointed out that by the stability of this thresholdshift after illumination, the pentacene <b>photoFET</b> does not only act as a light detector but also as a memory element, capable to store information about illumination power and duration for an extended amount of time. status: publishe...|$|E
