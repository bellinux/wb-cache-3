40|$|Background and Objective: Acne {{in women}} {{can often be}} {{successfully}} treated by the intake of oral contraceptives containing gestagens with anti-androgenic properties. This study aimed to evaluate {{the efficacy of the}} monophasic oral contraceptive ethinylestradiol/chlormadinone acetate (EE/CMA; Belara (R)) for the treatment of mild to moderate <b>papulopustular</b> <b>acne</b> of the face and acne-related disorders in comparison to EE/levonorgestrel (LNG; Microgynon (R)). Methods: 199 female acne patients were enrolled in a single-blind, randomized, multicentre phase III study and divided into two groups who received either EE/CMA or EE/LNG. The primary end point was fulfilled if the number of papules/pustules per half of the face present on admission had decreased by at least 50 % in the 12 th medication cycle. Results: 59. 4 % of the women under EE/CMA and 45. 9 % under EE/LNG were responders. The relative frequency of women with complete resolution was 16. 5 % under EE/CMA and 4. 3 % under EE/LNG at cycle 12. Conclusion: EE/CMA is an efficient treatment for women with mild and moderate <b>papulopustular</b> <b>acne</b> of the face and related disorders, reflecting the well-known anti-androgenic properties of the progestogen CMA.

40|$|Background and Aim: Acne vulgaris is {{a common}} {{disorder}} of adolescence which may lead to significant cosmetic and psychological problems. Different topical and systemic therapeutic modalities {{have been used to}} treat acne vulgaris. This study was designed to compare the efficacy of topical 0. 05 % isotretinoin gel with 1 % clindamycin solution in the treatment of acne vulgaris. Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, 60 patients with mild to moderate <b>papulopustular</b> <b>acne</b> vulgaris were randomly allocated into two groups of equal sizes. One group was treated with 0. 05 % isotretinoin gel every night. The other group was treated with 1 % clindamycin solution twice daily. Both groups were followed every month for 3 months. Results: The mean of total lesion count decreased significantly after treatment in comparison with its mean before the treatment in both groups (P< 0. 001). The mean of acne severity index significantly reduced after treatment in both groups (P< 0. 001). Satisfaction of patients in clindamycin group was higher (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Decrease in total lesion count and acne severity index in both treatment groups were statistically significant however, considering the minimal complications and satisfaction of patients in clindamycin group, 1 % solution of clindamycin may be recommended in the treatment of papulopustular of acne vulgaris...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the efficacy, safety and compliance of 500 mg azithromycin thrice weekly for 12 weeks in moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris. An open-label, noncomparative study was carried out for 12 weeks at Department of Dermatology and Plastic Surgery, La Sapienza University in Rome. Fifty-seven patients (20 male and 37 female) between 13 and 41 years of age, affected by moderate <b>papulopustular</b> and nodular <b>acne</b> vulgaris, were enrolled in the study. Azithromycin 500 mg was administered orally thrice weekly for 12 weeks. Patients were examined at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks (completion of treatment), evaluating both clinical (Global Acne Grading System, GAGS) and quality of life (Acne Quality of Life Questionnaire, AQoL) improvements. Forty-six patients completed the study and showed significant improvement. Six patients interrupted their treatment, while five patients did not complete the study for unknown reasons. Side effects (diarrhea and abdominal pain) were recorded in eight patients. Azithromycin, 500 mg thrice weekly for 12 weeks, is a safe and effective treatment for moderate acne vulgaris with excellent patient compliance...|$|R
40|$|Acne is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} skin disease {{that involves the}} pathogenesis of four major factors, such as androgen-induced increased sebum secretion, altered keratinization, colonization of Propionibacterium acnes, and inflammation. Several acne mono-treatment and combination treatment regimens are available and prescribed in the Indian market, ranging from retinoids, benzoyl peroxide (BPO), anti-infectives, and other miscellaneous agents. Although standard guidelines and recommendations overview the management of mild, moderate, and severe acne, relevance and positioning of each category of pharmacotherapy available in Indian market are still unexplained. The present article discusses the available topical and oral acne therapies and the challenges associated with the overall management of acne in India and suggestions and recommendations by the Indian dermatologists. The experts opined that among topical therapies, the combination therapies are preferred over monotherapy due to associated lower efficacy, poor tolerability, safety issues, adverse effects, and emerging bacterial resistance. Retinoids are preferred in comedonal acne and as maintenance therapy. In case of poor response, combination therapies BPO-retinoid or retinoid-antibacterials in <b>papulopustular</b> <b>acne</b> and retinoid-BPO or BPO-antibacterials in pustular-nodular acne are recommended. Oral agents are generally recommended for severe acne. Low-dose retinoids are economical and have better patient acceptance. Antibiotics should be prescribed till the inflammation is clinically visible. Antiandrogen therapy {{should be given to}} women with high androgen levels and are added to regimen to regularize the menstrual cycle. In late-onset hyperandrogenism, oral corticosteroids should be used. The experts recommended that an early initiation of therapy is directly proportional to effective therapeutic outcomes and prevent complications...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Acne is {{the most}} common {{dermatological}} disease and its manifestation especially exposes adolescent patients to a lot of psychological stress. While an adequate, fast acting treatment is crucial to reduce the burden of the disease, the information about when relevant improvement is achieved during the treatment is equally important. The time until onset of action (TOA) of acne medication has been neglected in reviews and studies so far. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to determine the TOA of acne treatment. Methods The primary outcome of this systematic review was to determine the time until a 25 % reduction of the mean number of inflammatory lesions (IL) was achieved. The secondary outcome was to determine the time until a 25 % reduction of the mean number of non-inflammatory lesions (NIL) and a 50 % reduction of the mean number of IL and NIL was achieved. A systematic literature search in Medline and Embase was performed, and head-to-head comparisons of treatments of mild-to-moderate <b>papulopustular</b> <b>acne</b> that were recommended in the European Evidence-based (S 3) Guidelines for the Treatment of Acne were included. Initially, the abstracts were screened and the full text of the relevant studies was analysed. Then the data extraction for the included studies was carried out. Results Regarding the reduction of inflammatory lesions, different concentrations of both benzoyl peroxide (BPO) and adapalene did not seem to effect the TOA, while BPO acted faster than isotretinoin and tretinoin. Adapalene and tretinoin were faster than Isotretinoin. Comparisons of adapalene and tretinoin showed conflicting results with a tendency for adapalene to act faster. The combination of clindamycin/BPO showed a shorter TOA than adapalene alone. When comparing the combination therapy of clindamycin/BPO with tretinoin alone, conflicting results were seen with a slight indication for the combination therapy to act quicker. Combination therapies of adapalene/BPO and clindamycin/BPO showed comparable results regarding the TOA. Discussion Different study designs and the limited quality of the studies resulted in limitations when interpreting the available data. Further studies are needed to determine the onset of action of acne therapy to enable physicians to identify the treatment that offers a fast improvement. Better Data regarding the onset of action of acne therapy could ultimately help to increase patients' adherence...|$|E
40|$|Tissue {{inflammation}} is a {{major component}} of the acne process. Leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) {{is considered to be a}} major player in the development of tissue inflammation. Synthesis of LTB 4 is controlled by the enzyme 5 -lipoxygenase. Since Zileuton blocks the activity of 5 -lipoxygenase, experimental and clinical studies have been conducted to test mode of function, as well as efficacy and safety of this compound in the treatment of acne vulgaris. Human SZ 95 sebocytes and inflammatory cells in vitro express the enzymes of the leukotriene pathway at mRNA and protein levels and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of LTB 4 are activated in sebaceous glands of acne lesions. Pre-treatment of SZ 95 sebocytes with Zileuton partially prevented short-term arachidonic acid-induced effects, such as induction of LTB 4, increase of neutral lipid content and stimulation of interlekin- 6 release. Long-term treatment with Zileuton directly reduced the content of neutral lipids and interleukin- 6 release from SZ 95 seb ocytes. PPAR mRNA levels were not regulated by Zileuton. In a first pilot clinical study with 10 patients with <b>papulopustular</b> <b>acne</b> Zileuton 4 × 600 mg/d p. o. for 3 months decreased the acne severity index in a time-dependent manner being 41 % of the initial score at week 12 (p < 0. 05). This was mostly due to a decrease of the number of inflammatory lesions of 29 % (p < 0. 01). In addition, total sebum lipids significantly decreased (35 %, p < 0. 05) and the pro-inflammatory free fatty acids (22 %) and lipoperoxides (26 %) were markedly diminished in patients’ sebum under treatment. The magnitude of clinical improvement strongly correlated with the reduction of total sebum lipids (p = 0. 0009, r 2 = 0. 81) and free fatty acids (p = 0. 0003, r 2 = 0. 82). In a further study, a 40 -year-old female with mild disseminated sebaceous gland hyperplasia and seborrhea, responded with normalization of the casual skin surface lipids and similar reduction of facial sebum synthesis under treatment with Zileuton over 2 weeks and—after a wash-out phase—low-dose isotretinoin (10 mg/ 2 nd d) over 5 weeks. These data are in agreement with a phase II multicenter, clinical study in 101 patients with mild to moderate inflammatory facial acne conducted in the US, which showed a significant efficacy of Zileuton in a subset of patients with moderate acne, whereas those patients treated with Zileuton showed a significant mean decrease in inflammatory lesions compared to the placebo group. In all clinical studies, Zileuton was found to be safe and well tolerated...|$|E
40|$|Background: Excessive {{androgen}} production, suspected {{in women}} when acne {{is accompanied by}} hirsutism and menstrual irregularities, {{may be due to}} congenital adrenal hyperplasia. This inherited disorder of cortisol biosynthesis is caused in more than 90 - 95 % of all cases by 21 -hydroxylase deficiency (21 -OHD). The steroid 21 -hydroxylase gene (CYP 21) has a high degree of variability. Objective: This study was conducted to evaluate CYP 21 gene mutations in a selected group of women with <b>papulopustular</b> and comedonal <b>acne</b> refractory to treatment, irregular menses and hirsutism. Methods: 30 out of 61 women enrolled underwent pelvic ultrasound examination and hormonal screening. In 9 patients with a polycystic ovary and hormonal pattern of adrenal hyperandrogenism a significant elevation of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulated 17 -hydroxyprogesterone was detected. These women positive in the ACTH stimulation test were submitted to CYP 21 gene analysis. Results: Genetic testing revealed several different point mutations and demonstrated that a cohort of patients resistant to acne therapy can be carriers or affected by non-classical 21 -OHD (late onset). Conclusion: Persistent acne can be the unique presenting sign of non-classical 21 -OHD. Evaluation of CYP 21 gene mutations may identify female carriers or patients for genetic counsellin...|$|R
