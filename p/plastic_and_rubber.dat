5|$|Like humans, {{but unlike}} most other mammals, guinea pigs cannot {{synthesize}} their own vitamin C and must obtain this vital nutrient from food. If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy. Guinea pigs require about 10mg of vitamin C daily (20mg if pregnant), {{which can be}} obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach) or through dietary supplements. Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; adequate amounts of vitamins E, A, and D are also necessary. Imbalanced diets {{have been associated with}} muscular dystrophy, metastatic calcification, difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems. Guinea pigs tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables, having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and their habits are difficult to change after maturity. They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types. A constant supply of hay or other food is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present. Because guinea pigs' teeth grow constantly, they routinely , lest their teeth become too large for their mouths, a common problem in rodents. Guinea pigs also chew on cloth, paper, <b>plastic,</b> <b>and</b> <b>rubber.</b>|$|E

25|$|Swedish author Henning Mankell {{reported}} that the capture of the Free Mediterranean took place about {{an hour after the}} raid on the Mavi Marmara. Israeli soldiers boarded the ship from three speedboats, and managed to bypass barbed wire that had been placed around the ship. The passengers formed a human ring on the bridge to block the soldiers, and Israeli troops responded by using physical force, electric shocks, <b>plastic</b> <b>and</b> <b>rubber</b> bullets, paintballs, and tear gas. A reporter for the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung wrote that Israeli soldiers approached passengers with guns drawn and tasered a 65-year-old person from a distance of ten centimeters. All of the passengers were handcuffed and subjected to body searches and had their passports confiscated. Those who refused to cooperate were reportedly met with physical force.|$|E

50|$|While {{much of the}} {{machining}} processes involved in mold making use computer-controlled equipment for the actual manufacturing of molds (particularly <b>plastic</b> <b>and</b> <b>rubber</b> injection and transfer).

Because of the high skill and intense labor involved much of the mold making in the US has been outsourced to low wage countries.The majority of <b>plastic</b> <b>and</b> <b>rubber</b> parts that are in existence today are made using injection or transfer molds- requiring a mold to be manufactured by a moldmaker.
