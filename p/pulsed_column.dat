In this work, {{the use of this}} technology has been extended to perform continuous precipitation. An original process of continuous precipitation in emulsion in a <b>pulsed</b> <b>column</b> is thereby developed. A thorough understanding of the behaviour of the dispersed phase inside the column helped to achieve process optimisation and is the purpose of this paper. In this aim, a coupled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) -population balance equation (PBE) approach was developed for the simulation of this original process, and allows the determination of the mean droplet size, which is a key parameter. On one hand, breakup and coalescence kernels for the PBE were selected by performing homogenous type experiments in a stirred tank reactor. The parameters of those kernels were adjusted by fitting the models' parameters to the measured droplets size distribution (DSD) in the stirred tank. One another hand, the continuous phase flow inside the <b>pulsed</b> <b>column</b> was investigated by CFD and has been validated using particle image velocimetry (PIV) data. The latter helped us to choose the best turbulence model representing the flow inside the <b>pulsed</b> <b>column.</b> Finally, the coupled CFD-PBE model was implemented using the quadrature method of moments (QMOM) in the CFD code ANSYS-Fluent (R) to determine the mean droplet size inside the column...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSolvent {{extraction}} {{is one of}} the {{key unit}} operations in the process industries including the fuel recovery unit of nuclear power plants. Among various types of solvent extraction units, the <b>pulsed</b> <b>column</b> is emerging as one of the best choices because of its much smaller footprints compared to the most commonly used mixer-settler type extraction units. Optimal design of a <b>pulsed</b> <b>column</b> requires a thorough understanding of the multiphase flow dynamics as the mass transfer efficiency depends directly on the interfacial area, which is influenced by the extent of turbulent mixing in the unit. The objective of the present work is to investigate the influence of operating parameters such as frequency and amplitude of pulse on the stage wise hold up. To that end, CFD based numerical simulations are carried out on disc and doughnut <b>pulsed</b> <b>column</b> with different operating condition and for two pairs of fluids i. e. ρc/ρd 1. Both continuous and dispersed phases are treated as inter-penetrating continua. The effect of turbulence on the continuous phase is captured using low Reynolds number k-ɛ model. Effect of the column geometry, diameter of the droplets of the dispersed phase, and operating conditions such as the frequency and amplitude of pulsation on the dispersion of the minor phase, is investigated. Simulation results are found to be in good agreement with the experimental observations reported in literature...|$|E

In this aim, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was developed for the simulation of a disc and doughnut <b>pulsed</b> <b>column.</b> To discuss the relevance of the RANS-based CFD model, the simulation results have been compared to Particle Image Velocimetry (Ply) measurements synchronized on the pulsation period. Since the behaviour of the dispersed phase is strongly dependent on the turbulent properties of the flow, such as eddies size and dissipation rate, the discussion is focussed on turbulent quantities. In this aim, 3 D simulations were first carried out and compared to 2 D axisymmetric ones. Then, different numerical schemes and turbulence models were compared to experimental data to choose the model offering the most accurate modelling of the single-phase flow...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe <b>pulsed</b> <b>column</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} used {{contactors}} in solvent extraction processes, especially in the nuclear fuel treatment industry and for hydrometallurgical applications. The optimisation of solvent extraction operations needs a thorough understanding of the diphasic flow’s properties inside the apparatus, especially that of the dispersed phase. For the first time, in-situ measurements of the drop size distribution (DSD) were achieved in a small diameter <b>pulsed</b> <b>column</b> (lab scale), by using the SOPAT-VF light reflectance video probe on two water-in-oil (W/O) systems exhibiting low and high viscosities of the oil phase. Separate effects of the pulse amplitude and frequency on the DSD and the phase hold-up were evidenced for both O/W systems, despite their different viscosity levels. This technique allowed very precise measurements of droplet-diameters in quite a confined space, three orders of magnitude, which is remarkable. Experimental findings allowed the validation of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) –population balance equation (PBE) coupled model and the improvement of breakage and coalescence kernel parameters. Rupture and coalescence mechanisms were correctly captured. The dependence of emulsion’s properties on the column hydrodynamics could then be illustrated over one period of the pulsed flow.

40|$|Continuous {{processes}} {{present the}} benefit to be {{safer and more}} cost saving than batch processes. Many researches {{have been carried out}} in fine chemistry but few contributions refer to polymerization. We focus on the vinyl chloride suspension polymerization. This process has been extensively studied in batch with lots of improvement regarding the formulation and the technologies. This polymerization process is highly complex due to the toxic nature of the monomer, the good manage of heat transfer and stirring. Moreover the reaction step remains the only batch step of the PVC production. According to the PVC grain formation, the process can be divided into three steps (i) a liquid-liquid dispersion step in which the monomer droplet (30 - 50 µm) are generated and stabilized, (ii) a controlled agglomeration step of the reacting droplets exhibiting a sticky behaviour, (iii) a reaction step until the conversion rate is around 80 - 90 % and the particles size is stable. In this study, the different technologies suitable for the different steps are pointed out. Based {{on the state of the}} art of the grain behaviour depending on the reaction conversion and on the literature concerning polymerization continuous process, static mixers and different co-current pulsed columns are proposed. Three technologies with different model system were chosen to study the liquid-liquid dispersion step. Static mixers allow the control of the droplet size under turbulent flow. In the range of the operating conditions, the dispersed phase concentration does not have a significant effect on the droplet size. The interfacial tension appears to be the most significant physico-chemical parameters. Correlation to predict the mean droplet size is proposed depending on different dimensionless numbers based on the hydrodynamics and on the systems: the Reynolds and Weber numbers. Given the promising results, static mixers are implemented at pilot scale to load the batch prior to polymerization. Their use demonstrates a noticeable reduction of the loading time and a better homogenisation of the different suspending agents and initiator inside the PVC grain. The two co-current pulsed columns design studied are the discs and doughnuts <b>pulsed</b> <b>column</b> and the COBR (continuous oscillatory baffled reactor, Nitech). For the first one, the effect of the packing materials (type and height), of the physico-chemical parameters (dispersed phase concentration, surfactant) and of hydrodynamic parameters (flowrate and oscillation conditions) on the droplet size are investigated where as for the second one the study is limited to the hydrodynamic parameters. A mean droplet size correlation is proposed based on the characteristic dimensionless numbers. The three continuous contactors used for liquid-liquid dispersion are compared in term of energy dissipation rate. The reaction is carried out in a continuous tubular reactor (the <b>pulsed</b> <b>column).</b> The column is suitable to transport solid-liquid suspension.

An {{evolution in}} the design of the internals and in the shape of the pulsation has been set up. The initial objectives were to achieve a reactor of greatly longer solid residence time, independently of the liquid phase. Phase contacting is carried out in a 1. 5 m height column. Liquid and solid are flowing countercurrently. Solid is fed in at the bottom of the column and flows upwardly, whatever the density difference between both phases. The behaviour of solid and liquid phases was investigated through the analysis of residence time distributions. The working conditions range has been determined and it was found that an optimal tuning of the operating conditions (pulsation parameters, flows control…) could minimize the influence of the size and the density of particles and uncouple residence times of both phases. The column has been manufactured, in order to handle a large range of solid-liquid systems (solid treatment, purification or reaction, raw materials, floating or dense particles, polydispersed particles). On the basis of the model calculations and design considerations, preliminary data can be given on the technical and economical feasibility of the various applications quoted above.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to propose a fast development method for batch to continuous processes transposition. This method is based on transient regime experiments analysis and is applied to a solid liquid extraction. The application under consideration is the extraction of an active principle from plant in a non-sinusoidal <b>pulsed</b> <b>column.</b> Typically, the proposed signal is composed of two different periods: in one hand, a classical sinusoidal pulsation step used to mix the liquid and solid phases in the active part of the column and allow an optimal mass transfer and, in a second hand, an impulsion phase, used generally for the transport of solid. The extraction is carried out in a disc and doughnut column of 54 mm in diameter, and 3. 5 m in height. Liquid and solid are flowing cocurrently and downwardly. This technological improvement has been implemented to solve the difficulties due to the important heterogeneity of the matter: part tends to float and other to sink, which always leads to a definitive flooding in classical operations. The effects of the solid flow rate and of the solvent characteristics on the hydrodynamic behavior of the column are studied. The mean residence time and the total solid holdup are calculated by using transient regime mass balance on experiments. These experiments allow pointing out and quantifying opposite effects of the operating parameters. Mass transfer experiments have been performed and the results fit calculated values obtained by coupling the hydrodynamic with batch extraction results. Despite of the simplification made, this validates the fast development method proposed to help the batch to continuous transposition. ...|$|E

40|$|Lowering the {{processing}} cost of liquid-liquid extraction {{by eliminating the}} clarification process, requires {{an understanding of the}} hydrodynamics and the operating regions of <b>pulsed</b> <b>column</b> when treating unclarified solutions. In order to achieve such an objective, an investigation has been carried out to measure and compare the total hold-up of clarified solutions and solvent in pulp operation for two potential commercial operations, uranium and gold tailings. Preliminary bench scale separation tests were carried out in order to evaluate phase separation characteristics and assist in the selection of the extractant phase with a minimum of emulsion formation. The results of these tests indicated good phase separation for the uranium aqueous tailings system. However, for the gold tailings system slight crud formation was noticed for the system chosen. Based on these bench scale tests, total hold-up measurements were made for eight systems using a pulsed sieve plate extraction column. The systems included both clarified solution (five) and solvent in pulp processing (three). Results of the clarified solutions test showed that, the hold-up increased with an increase in the amplitude of pulsing, dispersed phase flow rate and pH of the aqueous phase; while, hold-up is unaffected by the variation in the continuous phase flow rate. An increase in the pulse frequency decreased the hold-up in the mixer-settler region till it reached a minimum at the dispersion region. Then, in the emulsion region the hold-up increased with a further increase in pulse frequency. These results were in agreement with results obtained by Koren, Sehmel and Babb. Maintaining the operating conditions the same as in the clarified solution test; when spent uranium tailings were added to the aqueous phase, the column operated in the transition region between the mixer-settler and the emulsion region. The column remained in this region of operation till the pulse frequency or the pulse amplitude or both were increased. Stable emulsions obtained in gold tailings system prevented reliable hold-up measurements and suggested that this system can not be studied unless the crud formation is eliminated. A fractional factorial design was carried out during the experiments in order to minimize the number of runs and avoid erosion to the tailings pump. The experimental data of each system were fitted to a second order model as proposed by Bell and Babb in order to correlate the hold-up data. No common form of these equation models for predicting hold-up was noticed, each model had its unique identity. Different equations obtained from literature were used to predict the hold-up.

The results of the study indicate that separation is produced by the formation of crystals in the freezing section and by interphase mass-transfer in the adjacent purification section. The separation is mainly limited by axial eddy diffusion in the liquid phase. Data from three binary chemical systems were used in the study. The first system, m -chloronitrobenzene- m -bromonitrobenzene, forms a solid solution with a small phase separation (less than 6 wt. %) and was the primary subject of this study. The second system, azobenzenestilbene, forms a solid solution with a phase separation which exceeds 20 wt. %. The third system, benzene-cyclohexane, has essentially no solid solubility in the range of compositions for which data on separation have been reported (½ to 3 wt. % cyclohexane). Four mathematical models of column crystallization were developed and compared with experimental data. These models were based on different sets of assumptions as to the mechanisms which control the overall separation. The model which is consistent with experimental data was used to evaluate mass transfer coefficients and effective liquid-phase diffusivities.
