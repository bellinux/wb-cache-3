40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the solution operator for the wave equation {{on the flat}} Euclidean cone over the circle of radius ρ> 0, the manifold R+ × (R / 2 πρZ) equipped with the metric g(r, θ) = dr 2 + r 2 dθ 2. Using explicit representations of the solution operator in regions related to flat wave <b>propagation</b> and <b>diffraction</b> <b>by</b> the cone point, we prove dispersive estimates and hence scale invariant Strichartz estimates for the wave equation on flat cones. We then show that this yields corresponding inequalities on wedge domains, polygons, and Euclidean surfaces with conic singularities. This in turn yields well-posedness results for the nonlinear wave equation on such manifolds. Morawetz estimates on the cone are also treated. 1...|$|R

For that, high-order schemes, developed initially in the computational aeroacoustics community, are employed. A time-domain impedance boundary condition recently proposed in the literature is implemented to deal with reflexion of acoustic waves over the ground. In addition, curvilinear coordinates are used to account for topographic effects. First, test cases show that long range sound <b>propagation</b> and <b>diffraction</b> <b>by</b> obstacles in three-dimensional geometries are accurately determined. Simulation of the acoustic radiation by a broadband monopole source moving above a perfectly reflecting plane is then considered. Numerical results are satisfactorily compared to those obtained from an analytical solution. At last, {{the case of a}} broadband source moving above a non-flat terrain, with an inhomogeneous impedance ground, is investigated. The effects of a topography defect on the acoustic field are examined...|$|R
