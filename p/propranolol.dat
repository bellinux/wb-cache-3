5|$|In 1974 it was {{discovered}} that <b>propranolol</b> could prevent attacks. The concept of channelopathies and the link with specific ion channel mutations emerged {{at the end of the}} 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} excess thyroid hormone {{typically}} {{respond to the}} administration of a non-selective beta blocker, such as <b>propranolol</b> (as most of the symptoms are driven by increased levels of adrenaline {{and its effect on}} the β-adrenergic receptors). Subsequent attacks may be prevented by avoiding known precipitants, such as high salt or carbohydrate intake, until the thyroid disease has been adequately treated.|$|E
5|$|D. On August 15, 2008, the International Olympic Committee {{announced}} North Korean shooter Kim Jong-su {{had tested}} positive for the banned substance <b>propranolol</b> and was stripped of his two medals. He had won a bronze medal in the 10 metre air pistol and silver in the 50 metre pistol. After Kim Jong-su was disqualified, the bronze medal in the 10 metre air pistol went to Jason Turner of the United States; in the 50 metre pistol, the silver medal went to Tan Zongliang of China, and the bronze medal to Vladimir Isakov of Russia.|$|E
5|$|Management {{is based}} {{primarily}} on stopping the usage of the precipitating drugs, the administration of serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine, and supportive care including the control of agitation, the control of autonomic instability, and the control of hyperthermia. Additionally, those who ingest large doses of serotonergic agents may benefit from gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal {{if it can be}} administered within an hour of overdose. The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms. If the symptoms are mild, treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications, offering supportive measures, giving benzodiazepines for myoclonus, and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from serotonin antagonists. The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy, although there have been no controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy for serotonin syndrome. Despite the absence of controlled trials, {{there are a number of}} case reports detailing apparent improvement after people have been administered cyproheptadine. Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from serotonin antagonists. Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a nasogastric tube; it is unlikely to be effective in people administered activated charcoal and has limited use in severe cases. Additional pharmacological treatment for severe case includes administering atypical antipsychotic drugs with serotonin antagonist activity such as olanzapine. Critically ill people should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis. People who have autonomic instability such as low blood pressure require treatment with direct-acting sympathomimetics such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine. Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short-acting antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol; longer acting drugs such as <b>propranolol</b> should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and shock. The cause of serotonin toxicity or accumulation is an important factor in determining the course of treatment. Serotonin is catabolized by monoamine oxidase in the presence of oxygen, so if care is taken to prevent an unsafe spike in body temperature or metabolic acidosis, oxygenation will assist in dispatching the excess serotonin. The same principle applies to alcohol intoxication. In cases of serotonin syndrome caused by monoamine oxidase inhibitors oxygenation will not help to dispatch serotonin. In such instances, hydration is the main concern until the enzyme is regenerated.|$|E
25|$|In {{overdose}} <b>propranolol</b> {{is associated}} with seizures. Cardiac arrest may occur in <b>propranolol</b> overdose due to sudden ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock which may ultimately culminate in bradycardic PEA. Therefore, <b>propranolol</b> should be used with extreme caution in depressed or atypically depressed patients with possible suicidal ideation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Propranolol.</b> The {{addition}} of isosorbide mononitrate to <b>propranolol</b> treatment {{in patients with}} cirrhosis and portal hypertension caused a marked fall in portal pressure, a reduction in hepatic blood flow, cardiac output and mean arterial blood pressure, but no additional change in azygos blood flow. The additional effect of isosorbide mononitrate was especially evident in patients whose portal pressure was not reduced by <b>propranolol.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Propranolol</b> {{is being}} {{investigated}} as a potential treatment for PTSD. <b>Propranolol</b> works to inhibit the actions of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that enhances memory consolidation. Individuals given <b>propranolol</b> immediately after trauma experienced fewer stress-related symptoms and lower rates of PTSD than respective control groups who did not receive the drug. Due {{to the fact that}} memories and their emotional content are reconsolidated in the hours after they are recalled/re-experienced, <b>propranolol</b> can also diminish the emotional impact of already formed memories; for this reason, it is also being studied in the treatment of specific phobias, such as arachnophobia, dental fear, and social phobia.|$|E
25|$|Original <b>propranolol</b> was marketed in 1965 {{under the}} brand name Inderal and {{manufactured}} by ICI Pharmaceuticals (now AstraZeneca). <b>Propranolol</b> is also marketed under brand names Avlocardyl, Deralin, Dociton, Inderalici, InnoPran XL, Sumial, Anaprilin, and Bedranol SR (Sandoz). In India it is marketed under brand names such as Ciplar and Ciplar LA by Cipla. Hemangeol, a 4.28mg/mL solution of <b>propranolol,</b> is indicated {{for the treatment of}} proliferating infantile hemangioma.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to blockade of adrenergic receptors, <b>propranolol</b> has very weak inhibitory {{effects on the}} norepinephrine transporter and/or weakly stimulates norepinephrine release (i.e., the concentration of norepinephrine is increased in the synapse). Since <b>propranolol</b> blocks β-adrenoceptors, the increase in synaptic norepinephrine only results in α-adrenoceptor activation, with the α1-adrenoceptor being particularly important for effects observed in animal models. Therefore, it can be looked upon as a weak indirect α1-adrenoceptor agonist in {{addition to}} potent β-adrenoceptor antagonist. In addition to its effects on the adrenergic system, {{there is evidence that}} indicates that <b>propranolol</b> may act as a weak antagonist of certain serotonin receptors, namely the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2B receptors. The latter may be involved in the effectiveness of <b>propranolol</b> in the treatment of migraine at high doses.|$|E
25|$|Class II agents include atenolol, esmolol, <b>propranolol,</b> and metoprolol.|$|E
25|$|<b>Propranolol</b> is {{classified}} as a non-cardioselective sympatholytic beta blocker that crosses the blood–brain barrier. It is lipid soluble and also has sodium channel blocking effects. <b>Propranolol</b> is a non-selective beta blocker; that is, it blocks the action of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) at both β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. It has little intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, but has strong membrane stabilizing activity (only at high blood concentrations, e.g. overdose). <b>Propranolol</b> is able to cross the blood–brain barrier and exert effects in {{the central nervous system}} in addition to its peripheral activity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Propranolol</b> was {{not found}} to {{increase}} the discontinuation success rate.|$|E
25|$|Primidone is {{considered}} to be a first-line therapy for essential tremor along with <b>propranolol.</b> In terms of tremor amplitude reduction, it is just as effective as <b>propranolol,</b> reducing it by 50%. Both drugs are well studied for this condition, unlike other therapies, and are recommended for initial treatment. 25mg/day (low-dose therapy) is just as good as 75mg/day (high-dose therapy).|$|E
25|$|In a 1987 {{study by}} the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians, 27% of interviewed members {{admitted}} to using beta blockers such as <b>propranolol</b> for musical performances. For about 10–16% of performers, their degree of stage fright is considered pathological. <b>Propranolol</b> is used by musicians, actors, and public speakers {{for its ability to}} treat anxiety symptoms activated by the sympathetic nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Adverse drug {{reactions}} {{associated with}} <b>propranolol</b> therapy {{are similar to}} other lipophilic beta blockers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Propranolol</b> was {{discovered}} in 1964. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Propranolol</b> is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is between 0.24 and 2.16 per month as of 2014. In the United States it costs about 15 USD per month at a typical dose.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{research}} has been conducted to learn if <b>propranolol</b> could be useful in the treatment of some cancers.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine, {{fluvoxamine}} and <b>propranolol</b> {{causes a}} marked {{increase in the}} elimination half-life of bromazepam leading to increased accumulation of bromazepam.|$|E
25|$|British {{scientist}} James W. Black developed <b>propranolol</b> in the 1960s. In 1988, he {{was awarded}} the Nobel Prize in Medicine for this discovery. <b>Propranolol</b> was inspired by the early β-adrenergic antagonists dichloroisoprenaline and pronethalol. The key difference, which was carried through to essentially all subsequent beta blockers, was the inclusion of an oxymethylene group (-O-CH2-) between the aryl and ethanolamine moieties of pronethalol, greatly increasing the potency of the compound. This also apparently eliminated the carcinogenicity found with pronethalol in animal models.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine, omeprazole, oxcarbazepine, ticlopidine, topiramate, ketoconazole, itraconazole, disulfiram, fluvoxamine, isoniazid, erythromycin, probenecid, <b>propranolol,</b> imipramine, ciprofloxacin, fluoxetine, and {{valproic acid}} prolong {{the action of}} {{diazepam}} by inhibiting its elimination.|$|E
25|$|<b>Propranolol</b> is a blocker for the beta-adrenergic receptors in the {{amygdala}} which usually {{are bound to}} by stress hormones released by the adrenal gland- epinephrine and norepinephrine.|$|E
25|$|In April 1963, {{toxicity}} {{tests for}} pronethalol showed results of thymic tumours in mice. Nevertheless, it was launched under the trade name Alderlin, {{as the first}} clinically useful β-blocker. The launch took place in November 1963 when many small-scale clinical trials had proved their effectiveness in angina and certain types of arrhythmias. Pronethalol was only marketed for use in life-threatening situations. Dr. James Black went on to create another β-blocker, called propranolol; a non-selective β-blocker. Clinical trials started {{in the summer of}} 1964 and a year later, <b>propranolol</b> was launched under the trade name Inderal, only {{two and a half years}} after it had first been tested. It turned out to have a higher potency than pronethalol, with fewer side effects. <b>Propranolol</b> became the first major drug in the treatment of angina pectoris, since the introduction of coronary vasodilators, (such as nitroglycerin), almost 100 years earlier. <b>Propranolol</b> became a best-selling drug, used to treat a wide range of cardiovascular diseases such as arrhythmia, hypertension and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Propranolol</b> {{may be used}} {{to treat}} severe {{infantile}} hemangiomas (IHs). This treatment shows promise as being superior to corticosteroids when treating IHs. Extensive clinical case evidence and a small controlled trial support its efficacy.|$|E
25|$|All LAs are membrane-stabilizing drugs; they {{reversibly}} {{decrease the}} rate of depolarization and repolarization of excitable membranes (like nociceptors). Though many other drugs also have membrane-stabilizing properties, not all are used as LAs (<b>propranolol,</b> for example).|$|E
25|$|<b>Propranolol,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Inderal among others, is a {{medication}} of the beta blocker type. It is used to treat high blood pressure, a number of types of irregular heart rate, thyrotoxicosis, capillary hemangiomas, performance anxiety, and essential tremors. It is used to prevent migraine headaches, and to prevent further heart problems in those with angina or previous heart attacks. It can be taken by mouth or by injection into a vein. The formulation that is taken by mouth comes in short acting and long acting versions. <b>Propranolol</b> appears in the blood after 30 minutes and has a maximum effect between 60 and 90 minutes when taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|When {{symptoms}} of the essential tremors are considerably high, non-selective β-blockers are an important treatment option and usually the first choice. Studies have shown that <b>propranolol</b> did reduce symptoms the most in that category. The β-blockers can be used alone or in a combination.|$|E
25|$|<b>Propranolol</b> is not {{recommended}} {{for the treatment of}} hypertension by the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) because a higher rate of the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared to an angiotensin receptor blocker was noted in one study.|$|E
25|$|Both enantiomers of <b>propranolol</b> have a local {{anesthetic}} (topical) effect, {{which is}} normally mediated by blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. Studies have demonstrated propranolol's ability to block cardiac, neuronal, and skeletal voltage-gated sodium channels, accounting for its known membrane stabilizing effect and antiarrhythmic and other {{central nervous system}} effects.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{penetration}} across the blood–brain barrier, lipophilic beta blockers such as <b>propranolol</b> and metoprolol {{are more likely than}} other less lipophilic beta blockers to cause sleep disturbances such as insomnia and vivid dreams, and nightmares. Dreaming (rapid eye movement sleep, REM) was reduced and increased awakening.|$|E
25|$|Jason Turner {{originally}} finished fourth, behind Kim Jong Su of North Korea. On August 15, 2008, the International Olympic Committee announced Kim {{had tested}} positive for the banned substance <b>propranolol</b> and thus stripped of his medals from the 2008 Summer Olympics. Turner was awarded the bronze in 10 m air pistol.|$|E
25|$|Another {{study showed}} that emotionally arousing stories {{generally}} predicted better memory recall than stories which were less so. Subjects who read or listened to these arousing stories were less able to remember the details in response to multiple choice questions or in free recall when they {{had been given a}} dose of <b>propranolol</b> prior to the story exposure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Propranolol</b> is {{a highly}} {{lipophilic}} drug achieving high concentrations in the brain. The duration of action of a single oral dose is longer than the half-life and may be up to 12 hours, if the single dose is high enough (e.g., 80mg). Effective plasma concentrations are between 10 and 100mg/l. Toxic levels are associated with plasma concentrations above 2000mg/l.|$|E
25|$|<b>Propranolol,</b> {{like other}} beta blockers, is {{classified}} as pregnancy category C in the United States and ADEC category C in Australia. β-blocking agents in general reduce perfusion of the placenta which may lead to adverse outcomes for the neonate, including pulmonary or cardiac complications, or premature birth. The newborn may experience additional adverse effects such as hypoglycemia and bradycardia.|$|E
25|$|Primidone is not {{the only}} {{anticonvulsant}} used for essential tremor; the others include topiramate (Topamax) and gabapentin (Neurontin). Other pharmacological agents include alprazolam (Xanax), clonazepam (Klonopin), atenolol, sotalol, nadolol, clozapine, nimodipine, and botilinum toxin A. Many of these drugs were less effective (according to Table 1), but a few were not. Only <b>propranolol</b> has been compared to primidone in a clinical trial.|$|E
25|$|For portal hypertension, nonselective beta {{blockers}} such as <b>propranolol</b> or nadolol {{are commonly used}} to lower blood pressure over the portal system. In severe complications from portal hypertension, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) is occasionally indicated to relieve pressure on the portal vein. As this shunting can worsen hepatic encephalopathy, it is reserved for those patients at low risk of encephalopathy. TIPS is generally regarded only as a bridge to liver transplantation or as a palliative measure.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} <b>propranolol</b> was launched, ICI was {{beginning}} to experience competition from other companies. This potential threat led to ongoing refinements in the pharmacologic structure of β-blockers and subsequent advances in drug delivery. ICI studied analogues further and in 1970 launched practolol (figure 4) under the trade name Eraldin. It was withdrawn from the market {{a few years later}} because of the severe side effects it caused, nevertheless it played a large role in the fundamental study of β-blockade and β-receptors.|$|E
