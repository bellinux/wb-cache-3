When mixtures of the elemental powders were heated to a temperature near the melting point of Al under a PHIP of 150 MPa, the powder mixtures exothermically reacted and produced TiC <b>particle</b> <b>dispersed</b> and TiBB 2 <b>particle</b> <b>dispersed</b> FeAl-matrix composites. As the volume factions of TiC and TiB 2 particles increased from 0. 3 to 0. 8, the average particle size increased from approximately 1 to 10 μm and the average Vickers hardness increased from approximately 600 to 1600 in both the TiC-FeAl and TiB 2 -FeAl systems. The application of the PHIP remarkably reduced the porosity of the SHS products. Preheating of the elemental powder mixtures at 773 K for 30 minutes also reduced the porosity. Moreover, the preheating reduced the particle size in the SHS products. It was suggested that degassing of the powder surfaces and mutual diffusion between the different powders should have occurred during the preheating, which led to reduction in pore formation and reduction in heat generation at the SHS reactions, respectively...|$|E

The TiB 2 particle size decreased with increasing preheating time, temperature and pressure before the SHS reaction.

However, the particles usually aggregate rapidly {{and result in}} a very limited migration distance. This study employed poly acrylic acid (PAA) for the synthesis of stable bimetal nanoparticles (SBN) by selecting appropriate PAA molecular weight and dosage to reduce particle aggregation. In addition, this study elucidated the SBN stabilization mechanism by analyzing morphology and characteristics. The results of TCE dechlorination and SBN stabilization experiments indicate that the bimetal nanoparticles modified with PAA 250 K exhibit better reactivity and stability characteristics than did other such nanoparticles. The SBN bind chemically onto PAA 250 K via the carboxylic group and bidentate pattern bridging, which could provide both electrostatic and steric repulsion to prevent particle aggregation. Therefore, the SBN exhibited a higher dechlorination effect than did bare bimetal. The morphology of SBN shown in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images exhibits capsule-like and wire-like structures instead of a single <b>particle</b> <b>dispersed</b> in the slurry.

EMT assumes that the compliance surrounding the particle is the same as that in the matrix, whereas the SCC does in the averaged composite.

The accuracy of those were checked with a meso-mechanics analysis by FEM performed on a uniaxial tension of an infinite composite domain. The accuracy of the models by EMT and other existing models depends on the volume fraction of the inclusion and also on the rigidity ratio of the two phases, giving satisfactory results only up to about thirty percent of volume fraction.

40|$|The use of {{plastics}} in the automotive industries has increased {{significantly in the}} past few years. Concerns for the environment and the management of waste is encouraging the recycling and proper use of scrap material. Among others, polypropylene (PP) based bumpers are targeted for recycling because of their large volume and relatively simple material composition. Most of these bumpers are coated with polyurethane based paint which becomes dispersed into the matrix during reprocessing influencing the material properties. This seemed to be an important issue to investigate as it was shown by some other workers that the lowering of properties by the presence of paint particles was more significant than the material deterioration itself. So, with the complete recycling process, {{it is important to understand}} how the dispersed phase influences the processing and later the behaviour of the matrix so that in future investigations this knowledge can be utilised in further development of the recycled material. This has been the main theme of the project with the following major objectives: (i) to remove paint particles from the painted PP bumpers by melt filtration technique (ii) to determine the rheological and mechanical properties of the rubber toughened PP based composites dispersed with paint particles and glass microspheres and (iii) to understand the effect of dispersed phase on these properties by studying the morphology of the composites. Both commercially recycled material and real system blends prepared in the laboratory were studied to observe the effect of dispersed paint on the polymer matrix. Firstly the following materials were characterised using tensile, impact and rheological tests: virgin bumper bar grade material (PPIEPDMlta 1 c); two batches of material injection moulded from the virgin grade and painted with different levels of paint layers as found on car bumpers (unfiltered and melt filtered) and recycled painted bumpers (unfiltered and melt filtered). Extrusion melt filtration was chosen to remove the paint particles from the pp phase and the quantitative measurement of the dispersed phase was done by digital image analysis. Result of this analysis showed that only about 50 % paint was removed following filtration. Little variation was observed in viscosity values for all the samples with unfiltered batches showing slightly higher and filtered samples showing slightly lower viscosity compared to the virgin material. The increased value for the first case was attributed for the paint particles acting as the particulate phase in the matrix. On the other hand, lower viscosity was caused by deterioration of material with chain scission of PP. The elongation and impact strength of the paint dispersed batches decreased drastically compared to the virgin material as the paint particles acted as crack initiators and propagators. For the blends prepared, well characterised paint particles were dispersed into the PP/rubber/talc and PP/rubber matrix to be used as the &quot;real&quot; system. Talc itself is used as a filler in the commercial grades to impart greater stiffness, so composites without talc were worth examining to compare the effect of paint over talc. Also &quot;model&quot; filled systems with glass micro spheres were studied to observe the relative importance of particle shape and filler concentration. The choice to use glass as a model filler was primarily based on its spherical shape, non-deformable nature and relatively small surface area. The glass filled systems served as a comparison and helped in the interpretation of the rheological and mechanical properties of the paint dispersed in the rubber toughened talc filled and unfilled PP. The rheological study over the processing temperature range showed that the presence of small fraction of the dispersed phase (upto 1. 9 vol% for glass beads and 2. 7 vol% for paint particles) had insignificant effect on viscosity and at these levels the effect of particle size, particle size distribution and particle shape can be neglected. Only with increased filler fraction (5 vol %) a trend in increased viscosity was observed. From mechanical testing it was observed that the retention of tensile yield strength was nearly 100 % but elongation at break dropped significantly compared to the base matrices. This reduction was explained by poor interphase between filler and matrix. The modulus values for glass bead filled PP/rubber matrix showed an increasing tendency for high rigidity of the filler itself whereas for paint filled matrix it dropped below the base matrix value. For PP/rubber/talc matrix the scenario was different where a decrease in modulus was observed for all the composites. This was explained by the much high rigidity of talc particles over glass beads and paint particles. Though small sized talc particles acted as reinforcing fillers when added to PP/rubber system, the inclusion of second dispersed phase could not overshadow its effect on matrix thus failing as a weak structure. The drop in modulus for paint dispersed matrices was more significant indicating that irregular shaped paint particles had a smaller degree of interaction with the base matrix compared to spherical glass particles. A sharp decrease in impact strength observed for all the composites again explained the poor adhesion between matrix and dispersed phase which was also attributed from the photomicrographs of the fractured specimens. A separated microstructure was revealed for the composites which emphasised the explanation that the inclusions reduced the ability of the elastomer phase to absorb applied energy by reducing the distance between particles. A decrease in fracture energy and toughness for all the composites was also explained by the same. Models were proposed to predict crack propagation through glass bead and paint <b>particle</b> <b>dispersed</b> in the PP/rubber/talc matrices. For glass beads, crack propagation through the composite was attracted to the equator of particles so fractured surfaces showed clear hemispherical holes and top surfaces of debonded particles. For irregular paint dispersed composites, crack propagated through the interphase of filler and matrix thus debonding the paint particles. The composites under study were also related in terms of their rheology, morphology and mechanical properties. A separated microstructure of the composites as observed from the micrographs leads to the explanation of the slight increase in viscosity of filled composites over unfilled ones. Also poor interphase between filler and matrix leads to decreased property values in mechanical tests compared to base matrices...|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of an upper bound for the separation performance of polymeric membranes has motivated {{the development of new}} membrane materials with improved separation performance. Inorganic porous membranes like carbon molecular sieve (CMS) or zeolites have superior separation performance compared to polymeric membranes, but a challenging and costly manufacturing process have limited the commercialization of these membranes so far. Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) consisting of porous inorganic <b>particle</b> <b>dispersed</b> in a polymer matrix have been suggested as a way to produce a membrane with good mechanical properties and enhanced separation performance compared to polymeric membranes. Increasing amount of research during the last 20 years has revealed several factors that are important in order to produce MMMs with properties exceeding the Robeson upper line for polymer membranes. The most essential and challenging task seems to be to achieve good adhesion of polymer onto the particle surface and avoid formation of defects at the interface. In this study, two alternative methods for production of defect free MMMs were evaluated; in-situ carbonization and in-situ polymerization. In addition, the production of CMSMs from the new precursor material chitosan was evaluated, including pyrolysis at intermediate temperatures to produce CMSMs with reduced brittleness. CMSMs were prepared from the precursor material; chitosan. CMSMs prepared by pyrolysis of chitosan had separation properties exceeding Robeson upper bound for polymer membranes for several gas pairs. The effects of chitosan molecular weight, casting temperature and casting with different solvents were evaluated and based on the results a procedure for preparation of chitosan precursor films was selected. The effects of final pyrolysis temperature, heating rate and pyrolysis atmosphere were also investigated. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that chitosan decomposes between 240 - 400 °C. The permeability results showed that a pore structure was developed already at 300 °C while the highest CO 2 permeability was measured for a CMSM prepared at 650 °C when prepared under vacuum pyrolysis. Increasing the heating rate resulted in an increased permeability of the CMSMs. Pyrolysis in CO 2 atmosphere, a mild oxidizing atmosphere, was expected to increase the permeability of the CMS membrane, but instead the CMSMs produced in CO 2 at 650 or 750 °C showed lower permeability than the membrane prepared with vacuum pyrolysis with the same pyrolysis protocol. In-situ carbonization : Comparison of the thermal stability of chitosan and the polyimide Matrimid® showed that while the main weight loss for chitosan takes place between 240 and 400 °C, Matrimid was thermally stable up to ~ 500 °C. This observation was used to produce a “MMM” by in-situ carbonization of chitosan in a blend of chitosan and Matrimid at a pyrolysis temperature below the thermal decomposition temperature of Matrimid. Blend membranes with 90 : 10. 70 : 30, 60 : 40 : 20 : 80, 10 : 90 chitosan:Matrimid ratio were prepared. The 70 : 30 and 60 : 40 chitosan:Matrimid film showed large degree of phase separation and consequently had lower mechanical strength than the other precursor films. The blend films were pyrolysed at 400 °C with a soak time of 0, 50 or 150 min. The separation performances of the resulting membranes were close to or slightly above the Robeson 1991 upper bound. The only solvent that was found to dissolve both polymers was trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), but this solvent also affected the mechanical and separation properties of Matrimid. The films with 80, 90 and 100 % Matrimid turned out to be non-selective. In-situ polymerization of a monomer with dispersed CMS particles was evaluated as an alternative method to produce MMMs with good polymer-sieve contact. Several liquid monomers were evaluated based on their ability to disperse the CMS particles as well as separation performance of the polymers. Poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) prepared from monomers with 9 (EGDMA- 9) or 14 (EGDMA- 14) ethylene oxide units was found to be the most suitable monomer/polymer. CMS particles (M 650) were prepared from Matrimid, since the CMSMs prepared from chitosan had too low permeability to match the high permeability of the PEGDMA matrix. Separation into a polymer rich layer at the top and a CMS rich layer at the bottom during polymerization was found to be a problem. Faster formation of the membranes by increasing the polymerization rate was investigated as a method to fix the particles in the film and improve CMS distribution. Parameters like initiator type, initiator concentration, initiation method and polymerization temperature were evaluated. For UV initiated in-situ polymerization of PEGDMA 9 /M 650, two of the initiators (2, 2 '-Azobisisobutyronitrile (I- 1) and 4 -(dimethylamino) -benzophenone (I- 2)) resulted in a layered structure while (2 -benzyl- 2 -dimethylamino- 4 -morpholinobutyrophenone (I- 3)) resulted in MMMs with the CMS particle concentrated {{in the middle of the}} film. This film had no defects or holes and the permeability tests showed an increase in separation performance compared to the pure PEGDMA- 9 membrane. No significant difference in distribution of CMS particles was observed when different amount of initiator was used (0. 3, 0. 6 to 1. 2 wt%). For thermally initiated polymerization, increasing the amount of initiator from 0. 3 to 0. 6 wt% and polymerization temperature from 80 to 100 °C, resulted in a more uniform distribution of M 650 within the PEGDMA- 9 matrix. MMMs with good distribution of CMS particles were also produced by in-situ polymerization of PEGDMA- 14 under the same conditions. However, all the MMMs prepared by heat initiated in-situ polymerization contained small holes and defects. Changing initiator to from I- 1 to I- 4 (benzoyl peroxide), did not changed the distribution of CMS particles, despite the longer half-time of this initiator, indicating the initiation rate and polymerization rate is fast enough to fix the particles in the polymer and prevent formation of a layered structure. Addition of CMS particles resulted in a higher H 2 permeability and H 2 /CH 4 selectivity for all the MMMs compared to the pure PEGDMA films. However, for the gas pair CO 2 /CH 4, separation performance was more influenced by the preparation conditions and the distribution of CMS particles within the film. While a uniform distribution of particle was expected to give the highest raise in separation performance, the PEGDMA- 9 / 17 vol%M 650 MMM with best distribution of M 650 particles showed only a neglectable change in separation performance for the gas pair CO 2 /CH 4 indicating that other factors are influencing the transport. For MMMs prepared from PEGDMA- 14, the separation performance for the gas pair H 2 /CH 4 agreed very well with the predictions by Maxwell’s model based on the separation properties of the pure phases. The addition of M 650 to PEGDMA- 14 also resulted in a higher CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity that generally increased with increasing loading up to 39 vol%, while the CO 2 permeability was approximately unchanged. Rigidified zones of polymer around the particles with reduced mobility and/or partial blockage of the pores are suggested as reasons for why the permeability was lower than expected for CO 2, assuming that H 2 is too small to be influenced by any of the two phenomena to a large degree. The PEGDMA- 14 /M 650 MMMs had separation properties close to the Robeson 1991 upper bound and the best MMM has separation performance within the zone that is considered industrial applicable. For the best MMM, the H 2 permeability (35 °C, 2 bar) increased with 241 % (from 11 to 39 Barrer) and the H 2 /CH 4 selectivity increased with 416 % (from 3. 1 to 16), while the CO 2 permeability increased with 15 % (from 68 to 78) and the CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity increased with 74 % (from 19 to 33) compared to the pure PEGDMA- 14 membrane. The selectivity increased further when the temperature for the permeability test was decreased from 35 to ~ 23 °C. For CO 2 /CH 4 the selectivity increased from 33 at 35 °C to 46 at 23 °C, while the CO 2 permeability decreased from 78 to 55 Barrer.               PhD i kjemisk prosessteknologiPhD in Chemical Process Engineerin...|$|E

In the best cases, stabilized suspensions with MCNT-BTRU <b>particles</b> <b>dispersed</b> in silicone oil have been maintained {{for several months}} without any appreciable sedimentation being observed. Both the sedimentary and rheological properties of the MCNT-BTRU suspension were systematically studied and compared with their BTRU counterparts. Yield stress as high as 194 kPa was obtained in the MCNT-BTRU suspensions. The MCNT-BTRU based GER fluids, with their antisedimentation characteristic, may have broad engineering applications. © 2010 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss the {{existence}} and uniqueness for a class of fluid-particle interaction non-Newtonian models which describe the evolution of <b>particles</b> <b>dispersed</b> in a viscous compressible non-Newtonian fluid. The strong nonlinearity of the system and the singularity of the viscosity term bring about difficulties. Also, we admit an initial vacuum.|$|R

In this work we present the results of optical analysis of aqueous suspensions containing nanodiamonds, SEM analysis of diamond <b>particles</b> <b>dispersed</b> on silicon substrates and measurements of photoluminescence from defects in nanodiamonds. ...|$|R
