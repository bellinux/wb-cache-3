25|$|The Oath, {{ascribed}} to Hippocrates, forbade {{the use of}} pessaries to induce abortion.

500|$|Despite {{the lethal}} {{potential}} of Narcissus alkaloids, {{they have been}} used for centuries as traditional medicines for a variety of complaints, including cancer. Plants thought to be N. poeticus [...] and N. tazetta are described in the Bible in the treatment for what is thought to be cancer. In the Classical Greek world Hippocrates (ca. B.C. 460–370) recommended a <b>pessary</b> prepared from narcissus oil for uterine tumors, a practice continued by Pedanius Dioscorides (ca. A.D. 40–90) and Soranus of Ephesus (A.D. 98–138) in the first and second centuries A.D., while the Roman Pliny the Elder (A.D. 23–79), advocated topical use. The bulbs of N. poeticus contain the antineoplastic agent narciclasine. This usage is also found in later Arabian, North African, Central American and Chinese medicine during the Middle Ages. In China N. tazetta var. chinensis was grown as an ornamental plant but the bulbs were applied topically to tumors in traditional folk medicine. These bulbs contain pretazettine, an active antitumor compound.|$|E

2500|$|The use {{of rubber}} pessaries for {{contraception}} likely {{arose from the}} 19th-century practice of correcting a prolapsed uterus with such a device; the condition {{seems to have been}} far more frequently diagnosed than its incidence would warrant, and at times may have been a fiction for employing a <b>pessary</b> for birth control. As with the production of condoms for men, the development of vulcanized rubber by Charles Goodyear helped make barrier contraceptives for women more reliable and inexpensive. Other terms for the contraceptive diaphragm were [...] "female preventatives", [...] "female protectors", [...] "Victoria's protectors", and the [...] "French pessary" [...] ("F.P.") or pessaire preventif. This linguistic variety, some of it euphemistic, makes it difficult to distinguish in the literature among diaphragms, cervical caps, female condoms, and other pessaries; one form of [...] "womb veil" [...] is described in 1890 as [...] "like a ring <b>pessary</b> covered by a membraneous envelope." [...] Another source in 1895 describes it as [...] "a small soft rubber cup surrounded at the brim by a flexible rubber ring about an inch or inch and a quarter in diameter." ...|$|E
2500|$|The womb veil was a 19th-century American form of barrier {{contraception}} {{consisting of}} an occlusive <b>pessary,</b> i.e. a device {{inserted into the}} vagina to block access of the sperm into the uterus. Made of rubber, it was a forerunner to the modern diaphragm and cervical cap. The name was first used by Edward Bliss Foote in 1863 for the device he designed and marketed. [...] "Womb veil" [...] became the most common 19th-century American term for similar devices, and continued to be used into the early 20th century. Womb veils were among a [...] "range of contraceptive technology of questionable efficacy" [...] available to American women of the 19th century, forms of which began to be advertised in the 1830s and 1840s. They could be bought widely through mail-order catalogues; when induced abortion was criminalized during the 1870s, reliance on birth control increased. Womb veils were touted as a discreet form of contraception, with one catalogue of erotic products from the 1860s promising {{that they could be}} [...] "used by the female without danger of detection by the male." ...|$|E

50|$|A <b>pessary</b> is {{a medical}} device that is {{inserted}} into the vagina. The most common kind is ring shaped, and is typically recommended to correct vaginal prolapse.

40|$|Background In IVF, Luteal phase {{support is}} usually {{performed}} using vaginal progesterone. A part of patients using this route reports being uncomfortable with this route. We tried to study whether the rectal route {{could be an}} effective alternative and associated with less discomfort. Patients and Methods A prospective randomized controlled study. All patient were eligible for IVF treatment for infertility. After oocyte pickup, 186 patients were allocated to one the following protocols for luteal phase support: (i) rectal <b>pessaries</b> group: natural progesterone <b>pessaries</b> administered rectally 200 mg three times a day, (ii) vaginal <b>pessaries</b> group: natural progesterone <b>pessaries</b> administered vaginally 200 mg three times a day), and (iii) vaginal capsules group: natural micronized progesterone capsules administered vaginally 200 mg three times a day. On the day of pregnancy test, patients were asked to fill in a questionnaire conducted by an investigator {{in order to assess}} the tolerability and side effects of the LPS treatment taken. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of perineal irritation. Results Fifty eight patients were assigned to the rectal <b>pessaries</b> group, 68 patients to the vaginal <b>pessaries</b> group, and 60 patients to the vaginal capsules group. All patients adhered to their allocated treatment. Implantation and clinical pregnancy rates per transfer did not differ between the three groups. Perineal irritation, which was our primary endpoint, was the same for all the three groups (respectively 1. 7 % versus 5. 9 % versus 11. 7 %). Regarding the other side effects, more patients experienced constipation and flatulence with the rectal route, whereas more patients reported vaginal discharge in the vaginal capsules group.

40|$|Q. What is {{the best}} nonsurgical therapy for pelvic organ prolapse?

PFMT transiently improves patient satisfaction and reduces urinary incontinence more than <b>pessaries</b> do (strength of recommendation [SOR]: B, a randomized controlled trial [RCT]). PFMT moderately improves prolapse symptoms and severity, especially following 6 months of supervised intervention (SOR: B, a systematic review of randomized trials with some methodologic flaws). Two <b>pessaries</b> (ring with support and Gellhorn) reduce symptoms {{in as many as}} 60 % of patients (SOR: B, a systematic review of randomized trials).

50|$|A {{therapeutic}} <b>pessary</b> is {{a medical}} device similar to the outer ring of a diaphragm. Therapeutic pessaries are used to support the uterus, vagina, bladder, or rectum.

50|$|Pregnant {{women are}} at risk of giving birth too early when their cervix begin to efface (shorten) and dilate (open). Different {{treatments}} have been tried to prevent a late miscarriage or preterm birth. A common treatment is cervical cerclage or stitch when a suture is stitched around the opening of the cervix around 12-14 weeks into the pregnancy. A cervical <b>pessary</b> is being studied as an alternative to cervical cerclage since there are fewer potential complications. More medical studies are needed to decide whether a cervical <b>pessary</b> is equal to or the best treatment. A 2016 study (encompassing 9 countries and 935 women) demonstrated that placement of a cervical <b>pessary</b> in women with a short cervix did not result in a lower rate of preterm delivery than the rate with expectant management.|$|E
50|$|Precursors to IUDs {{were first}} marketed in 1902. Developed from stem pessaries (where the stem held the <b>pessary</b> in {{place over the}} cervix), the 'stem' on these devices {{actually}} extended into the uterus itself. Because they occupied both the vagina and the uterus, this type of stem <b>pessary</b> was also known as an interuterine device. Use of interuterine devices was associated with high rates of infection; for this reason, they were condemned by the medical community.|$|E

50|$|The Arabin <b>Pessary</b> is a {{silicone}} {{device that}} has been suggested to prevent spontaneous preterm birth {{without the need for}} surgery. The leading hypotheses for its mechanisms were that is could help keep the cervix closed similarly to the cerclage, as well as change the inclination of the cervical canal so that the pregnancy weight is not directly above the internal os. However, large randomized clinical trials in singleton and twin pregnancies found that the cervical pessary did not result in a lower rate of spontaneous early preterm birth. Therefore, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommendation is that placement of cervical <b>pessary</b> in pregnancy to decrease preterm birth, should be used only {{in the context of a}} clinical trial or research protocol.|$|E
