50|$|A notice {{displayed}} at the entrance states that the building was built by William Chimney in 1480. This detached two-storey building, close to the church, is the other Grade II* listed building in the parish. and is timber framed tudor period with 19th and 20th century extensions, plastered, roofed with handmade red clay tiles, an inside wall has a Victorian chimney stack. Two plain boarded doors form the entrance, on which side windows have horizontally sliding sashes of 16 panes, four on both floors, and one C20 casement window on first floor. Facing the church are two small 20th century casement windows, whereas the first floor has four 19th century neo-gothic cast-iron casement windows. Some framing remains exposed internally. On ground floor, at the NW end a stairway rises from one external door to the first floor. At the SE end an original <b>studded</b> <b>partition</b> separates one bay from the remainder — the main section is open.|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{degradation}} of chemically treated plywood of Shorea parvifolia as the facing material in timber <b>stud</b> <b>partition</b> was investigated. The plywoods {{were treated with}} Dricon, Monoammonium Phosphate, Diammonium Phosphate and mixture of Borax and Boric Acid at 20 % concentration.

The fire resistance of the partitions was evaluated using 1. 5 m by 1. 5 m gas-fired furnace following the standard temperature-time curve set by the British Standard, BS 476 : Part 22 : 1987. The rating measures the integrity-ability to withstand collapse or sustained flaming and the insulation-ability to prevent excessive increase of temperature. In this study the best fire resistance rating time based on integrity failure was the partition using Shorea parvifolia plywood treated with Dricon (118 min.) followed by Diammonium Phosphate (116 min.), Monoammonium Phosphate (109 min.) and Borax and Boric Acid (97 min.) respectively.

5000|$|Adding {{absorptive}} {{materials to}} the interior surfaces of rooms (e.g. fabric-faced fiberglass panels, thick curtains) {{will result in a}} decrease of reverberated sound energy within the room. However, absorptive interior surface treatments do not significantly improve the sound isolation from one room to another through demising partitions over the typical frequency range measured currently. Installing absorptive insulation (e.g., fiberglass batts, blow-in cellulose, mineral fiber batts) into the wall or ceiling cavities affects the sound isolation of the partition to varying degrees, depending on the framing configuration and joist or stud depth. For example, the presence of type of insulation in single 2x4 wood stud framing spaced 16" [...] (406 mm) on-center results in only a few STC points. In contrast, adding standard fiberglass insulation to an otherwise empty cavity in light-gauge (25-gauge or lighter) steel <b>stud</b> <b>partitions</b> can result in a nearly 10 STC-point improvement. As the stud gauge becomes heavier, the presence and type of insulation matters less.|$|R

40|$|Past {{earthquakes}} {{have shown}} that the damage to non-structural elements can severely limit the functionality of most affected buildings and cause substantial economic losses. Among the non-structural building components, the ceiling-partition systems represent a large economic investment in construction sector. Nevertheless, their seismic performance is poorly understood, because information and specific guidance are very limited. In the last years, international studies have been conducted on the seismic behaviour of light gage steel <b>stud</b> <b>partition</b> walls (Lee et al. [1], Restrepo and Bersofsky [2], Tasligedik et al. [3], Retamales et al. [4], Magliulo at al. [5]), suspended ceilings (Badillo et al. [6], Magliulo et al. [7], Gilani et al. [8], Soroushian et al. [9],) and partition walls - ceiling systems (Filiatrault et al. [10], McCormick at al. [11]). Since the behaviour of these systems cannot be easily simulated with traditional structural analysis, experimentation is the main way to assess the seismic response. For these reasons, an experimental campaign has been planned at the University of Naples Federico II with the main aim to characterize the seismic response of different Cold-Formed Steel (CFS) partition drywalls and suspended continuous plasterboard ceilings. The current paper presents the research project, in terms of experimental program, prototypes and specifically designed set-up...|$|R
5000|$|The {{effect of}} adding {{multiple}} layers of gypsum wallboard to a frame also varies depending on the framing type and configuration. Doubling the mass of a partition does not double the STC, as the STC is calculated from a non-linear decibel sound transmission loss measurement. So, whereas installing an additional layer of gypsum wallboard to a light-gauge (25-ga. or lighter) steel <b>stud</b> <b>partition</b> will result in about a 5 STC-point increase, doing the same on single wood or single heavy-gauge steel will result in only 2 to 3 additional STC points. Adding a second additional layer (to the already 3-layer system) does not result in as drastic an STC change as the first additional layer. The effect of additional gypsum wallboard layers on double- and staggered-stud partitions {{is similar to that}} of light-gauge steel partitions. Due to increased mass, poured concrete and concrete blocks typically achieve higher STC values (in the mid STC 40s to the mid STC 50s) than equally thick framed walls. [...] However the additional weight, added complexity of construction, and poor thermal insulation tend to limit masonry wall partitions as a viable sound isolation solution in many building construction projects. Temperate climates and hurricane- or tornado-prone areas may, however, require the use of masonry walls for structural stability.|$|R

50|$|Toenailing or skew-nailing is {{a popular}} {{technique}} that carpenters use regularly to fix two timbers together by slanted application. The fasteners (nails or screws), used in pairs, are driven in on opposing angles. This locks the timbers together, to create a stable framework, e.g. in <b>stud</b> walls (<b>partitions)</b> or roof framing. The angled nailing makes later dismantling difficult or destructive. One {{of the most common}} places to toenail a framing member is where a rafter meets the top plate of a wall at the birdsmouth. Alternatives to toenailing include the use of hurricane ties, joist hangers, and other engineered steel connectors that permit nails to be attached perpendicular to a member's surface.|$|R

40|$|Acoustic {{bridging}} through structural links {{is known}} to reduce the Sound Transmission Loss (STL) of gypsum plasterboard partition walls with steel studs. As multifamily housing become more popular, stud manufacturers are increasingly interested in improving the acoustic characteristics of steel studs to improve the sound insulation. This work is an initial attempt to understand the influence of slotted stud configurations on the sound transmission loss (STL) of partition walls. A case of partition wall {{commonly known as the}} double-leaf wall incorporating a slotted stud design is analysed experimentally and numerically based on the ISO 10140 guidelines. The numerical model used for the analysis is validated using experimental test at one-third-octave bands for a frequency range of 100 to 3150 Hz. The slot configurations are designed keeping the slot to non-slot area constant to identify the effect of slot location on the acoustic and structural behaviour. The results of this study provide {{a better understanding of the}} acoustic performance of double-leaf walls that use slotted stud sections.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Designing for {{construction}} safety {{is part of}} standard practice {{in countries such as}} the UK, Australia, and South Africa. Designing the permanent facility in a manner to eliminate or reduce the risks of injury, illness, or fatality of construction workers is defined as designing {{for construction}} safety (DfCS). Although evident through research that design is one of the contributing factors to construction hazards, the US construction industry has been resistant in implementing DfCS. Lack of designers' knowledge about the construction processes and limited availability of DfCS tools are examples of inhibitors to {{the development and implementation of}} DfCS. This thesis describes a research effort to develop a DfCS tool that provides knowledge of the construction processes to the designer and helps the designer evaluate design elements in terms of risk factors. The tool, which focuses on a multistory commercial office building, was developed using results obtained from a comprehensive field survey and analysis program on safety risks associated with constructing different design features. The field survey program included the accumulation of 89 design elements and 473 construction activities from construction literature. Using survey methodology, the average exposure and average frequency of four severity categories were obtained for each construction activity. The inputs were provided by superintendents and/or safety managers of general contracting and trade contracting firms. Together the respondents provided a total of more than 33, 800 ratings. The analytical program included conversion of the ratings obtained from the field survey program into unit risk and cumulative risk factors using appropriate scales and computations. The results of this research include the quantification of the unit risk and cumulative risk factors for the 89 design elements and the 473 construction activities. These were put into a MS Excel® spreadsheet which can be used for designing for construction safety. The data was also used to analyze comparisons between risk perceptions of the respondent groups. Group comparisons were made between general contractor superintendents vs trade contractors, general contractor safety managers vs trade contractors, and general contractors vs trade contractors. Using cast-in-place concrete column as an example, the activity risk factors, the four severity category risk factors, and the total risk factors were individually compared. The results indicate that there is no evidence of a difference in risk perception between general contractor superintendents and general contractor safety managers in terms of risk ratings for the activity risk, severity categories, and total risk comparisons. The construction and removal of formwork and pouring of concrete show moderate to suggestive evidence of a difference in the sample mean risk perceptions for the three group comparisons. For the four severity levels and total risk comparisons, there is moderate to suggestive evidence of a difference for medium severity, high severity, and total risk for the three group comparisons. There is no evidence of a difference in the way the groups perceive near miss risks. Additionally, comparison between design elements was analyzed. For steel stud versus concrete masonry unit block partition walls, there is moderate evidence that on an average, the construction of CMU block wall has a larger cumulative risk of medium severity and high severity injuries. There is suggestive evidence that the average near misses are more for CMU block partition walls than for steel <b>stud</b> <b>partition</b> walls. Finally, there is moderate evidence that on an average, the total cumulative risk associated with CMU block wall construction is more than that during steel stud wall construction...|$|R
40|$|The cost of earthquake-induced {{damage to}} nonstructural {{components}} and systems (NCSs) has greatly exceeded {{the cost of}} structural damage. Although, numerous types of NCSs exist and contribute to this damage, {{one of the most}} prevalent is the light-weight (metal or wood <b>stud)</b> interior <b>partition</b> wall. The interior partition wall (PW) is a complex system with multiple attachments between floors, structural walls, or columns. Although these systems are not anticipated to interact with the building significantly; to date, few studies have been conducted to comprehensively evaluate if they influence the response of the building. What is known is that PWs are subjected to the dynamic environment of the building and continue to observe damage at much lower amplitude seismic demands than that of the structural system. As a result, building designers would benefit from numerical tools for predicting the impact of PW subsystems on the overall building response and evaluating the PW behavior itself. To this end, a numerical model is developed that captures the in-plane seismic response of full-height cold-formed steel framed PWs. This behavior is lumped into a nonlinear zero-length spring for ease of implementation in beam- column type finite element analyses. Experimental data is used to calibrate the model by representing the force- displacement and the dissipated energy relationships. Two different error metrics are used to illustrate the model's robustness with particular attention to the prediction of experimental behavior. To evaluate the effects of the PW on the building response, a suite of nine building models with a wide fundamental period distribution is selected. Eigenvalue, nonlinear pushover, and nonlinear time history analyses are used to examine the effects on the interstory drift and floor acceleration. Analyses indicate that the fundamental period can decrease up to 15 %, due to the added stiffness of the partition wall. If the PW is neglected in the building analysis, the peak interstory drift and floor acceleration can be underestimated by approximately 50 %. By tracking the period of the coupled (building-partition wall) system, the PW is shown to soften before the structural system. This softening confirms the vulnerability of the PW system at lower spectral demands, which is consistent with earthquake reconnaissance and experimental observation...|$|R
50|$|Unique in Montgomeryshire {{in that it}} is timber-built. Single-chamber, {{with south}} porch and west belfry; the {{original}} timber framed building is likely to be 15th or 16th century in date. It was restored in 1856 with an outer outer timber framed casing and brick nogging outside and matchboarding inside. The church was restored again in September 2014 and this revealed that where the original timber-framing was intact, wooden panels were used to infill the framework, rather than the normal wattle and daub. Possibly at a later date lathes had been nailed to the framing, and this had then been torched, so that the outside of the church, before the 1856 restoration, would have presented a smooth rendered surface. The church has simple 19th-century cusped timber windows. The 15th-century roof of principals and arched braces has two tiers of trefoiled wind-braces. Every other truss was strengthened with a tie-beam, now sawn off, and replaced with iron tie rods. The flagstone floor is inset with C17 and C18 memorial slabs at the East end.The square wooden bell turret has a slatted lower stage and a second stage consisting of two square-headed louvred apertures in each face. There is a pyramidal slate roof surmounted by a wrought iron weathervane.The truss at the west end defines the position of the former gallery, which was originally reached by a ladder stair set in the north-west corner. Four modern chamfered uprights support what is now the bell turret. Behind these the ceiling slopes downwards broken only by the window aperture above. The front of the bell turret, formerly the gallery, has close-set <b>studs,</b> <b>plastered</b> between, with a large thick beam for the top rail.|$|R
40|$|Published {{test reports}} on the sound {{insulation}} of gypsum <b>plaster</b> board cavity <b>stud</b> walls with viscoelastic glue sandwiched between two layers of gypsum plaster board working as a constrained layer damper show large increases in sound insulation compared to the sound insulation of the same wall without the viscoelastic material. An increase in the sound insulation would be expected above the critical frequency of the gypsum plaster board panels and {{in the vicinity of}} the mass-air-mass resonant frequency due to the increased damping. However the test results show significant increases at other frequencies as well. A critical examination of the theory shows that the sound transmission via the air in the wall cavity is not expected to be greatly affected by the damping at these other frequencies. On the other hand, the sound transmission via the studs is affected at all frequencies by the damping. Hence it is not surprising that the published results are all for cavity stud walls. The sound insulation of two 16 mm thick gypsum plaster board sheets was measured. The sheets were mounted touching each other in three different configurations. These were without glue in between, bonded together with viscoelastic glue and spot bonded together with standard commercial glue. Surprisingly the elastic material compound gave better results even below the critical frequency, although the improvement became smaller and then disappeared as the frequency was decreased. A cavity stud wall with the second and third of the above configurations on each side of the studs was also tested. Again the viscoelastic glue performed better than the standard commercial glue, but the viscoelastic results were less than the original published results. Further published results were found which were in between the original published results and the experimental results obtained by the authors of this paper...|$|R
