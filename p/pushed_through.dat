5|$|Charles Leale, a young Army surgeon, <b>pushed</b> <b>through</b> {{the crowd}} {{to the door of}} Lincoln's box but found it would not open. Rathbone, inside the door, soon noticed and removed the wooden brace with which Booth had jammed it shut.|$|E

5|$|As a California Assemblyman, Ryan {{also served}} as the Chairman of {{legislative}} subcommittee hearings and presided over hearings involving his later successor as Congressman, Tom Lantos.

5|$|At 10:00, the Germans {{began their}} most {{successful}} {{assault on the}} perimeter, attacking the southeastern end with infantry supported by newly arrived Tiger tanks. This assault <b>pushed</b> <b>through</b> the defenders' outer lines and threatened to isolate {{the bulk of the}} division from the river. Strong counterattacks from the mixed defenders and concentrated shellfire from south of the river eventually repelled the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Hsu {{worked to}} make Tainan a smoke-free environment. After the {{successful}} ban of smoking in public {{areas such as}} shopping centers, he <b>pushed</b> <b>through</b> the ban of smoking in historical sites. The Chihkan Tower became the first smoke-free historical site in Taiwan after {{the passing of the}} regulation in October 2007. Other historical sites covered by the regulation include Tainan Confucian Temple, Fort Zeelandia, and Eternal Golden Castle.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} effectively illegalised the ROIA {{and led to}} {{the immediate}} release of O'Brien and the other detained individuals, who sued the British Government for false imprisonment. The government <b>pushed</b> <b>through</b> the Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity) Act 1923, which limited the money they had to pay the detainees, who eventually received £43,000. O'Brien himself was re-arrested and found guilty of sedition, and was imprisoned until 1924.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Salman Khurshid, India’s law minister, {{claiming}} that many opposition parties, including the Bharatiya Janata Party, had privately encouraged the government to <b>push</b> <b>through</b> the retail reform, the intense criticism now targets Congress-led coalition government, and its decision to <b>push</b> <b>through</b> {{one of the biggest}} economic reforms in years for India. Opposition parties claim supermarket chains are ill-advised, unilateral and unwelcome.|$|R
5|$|Across the battlefield, as {{the first}} line of Persian ships was pushed back by the Greeks, they became fouled in the {{advancing}} second and third lines of their own ships. On the Greek left, the Persian admiral Ariabignes (a brother of Xerxes) was killed early in the battle; left disorganised and leaderless, the Phoenician squadrons appear to have been pushed back against the coast, many vessels running aground. In the centre, a wedge of Greek ships <b>pushed</b> <b>through</b> the Persians lines, splitting the fleet in two.|$|E
5|$|As the {{prestige}} of winning the Cup grew, so did the need to attract top players. Only nine months after winning the Cup, in March 1906, the Montreal Wanderers <b>pushed</b> <b>through</b> a resolution {{at the annual meeting}} of the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) that would allow professional players to play alongside amateurs. Because the ECAHA was the top hockey league in Canada at the time, the Cup trustees agreed to open the challenges to professional teams. The first professional competition came one month later during the Wanderers' two-game, total goals challenge series, which they won 17goals to 5.|$|E
5|$|At Issus in 333BC, {{his first}} {{confrontation}} with Darius, {{he used the}} same deployment, and again the central phalanx <b>pushed</b> <b>through.</b> Alexander personally led the charge in the center, routing the opposing army. At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels {{to break up the}} phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming. The advance was successful and broke Darius' center, causing the latter to flee once again.|$|E

5|$|I Corps, {{striking}} south {{out of the}} Orne bridgehead, {{was halted}} by the 21st Panzer Division and the attack by XXX Corps west of Caen was {{stopped in front of}} Tilly-sur-Seulles by the Panzer-Lehr-Division. To force Panzer-Lehr to withdraw or surrender and to keep operations fluid, part of the 7th Armoured Division <b>pushed</b> <b>through</b> a gap in the German front line near Caumont and captured Villers-Bocage. The Battle of Villers-Bocage led to the vanguard of the 7th Armoured Division being ambushed and withdrawing from the town but by 17 June, Panzer Lehr had also been forced back and XXX Corps had taken Tilly-sur-Seulles.|$|E
5|$|In 1139 Foliot {{was elected}} Abbot of Gloucester, blessed by the diocesan bishop on 11June 1139. The {{appointment}} had been <b>pushed</b> <b>through</b> by Foliot's relative, Miles of Gloucester, who was {{by then the}} Earl of Hereford. Foliot was well connected at court in other respects, for his probable father had been steward to David I, before David became King of Scotland. David was the uncle of both the Empress and Stephen's wife. Following his elevation to abbot Foliot recognised Stephen as king, although he seems until then to have supported Matilda.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 2002, the Division Support Command {{deployed}} in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom I, earning the Presidential Unit Citation {{along with the rest}} of the 3rd Infantry Division. The Brigade and its division had spearheaded the invasion into the nation of Iraq, supporting the four brigades as they <b>pushed</b> <b>through</b> southern Iraq and into the capital of Baghdad. After the initial invasion and capture of Baghdad, the brigade remained in the city, supporting the 3rd Infantry Division as the unit conducted counterinsurgency and infrastructure activities in the area. It returned home to Fort Stewart in August 2003.|$|E

5|$|James VI's {{inheritance}} of the English crown in 1603 led to rule via the Privy Council from London. He also increasingly controlled the {{meetings of the}} Scottish General Assembly and increased the number and powers of the Scottish bishops. In 1618, he held a General Assembly and <b>pushed</b> <b>through</b> Five Articles, which included practices that had been retained in England but largely abolished in Scotland, most controversially kneeling for the reception of communion. Although ratified, they created widespread opposition and resentment and were {{seen by many as}} a step back to Catholic practice.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{was in his}} Senate offices {{meeting with}} First Lady Laura Bush when the September 11, 2001, attacks took place. Two of the {{airplanes}} involved had taken off from Boston, and in the following weeks, Kennedy telephoned each of the 177 Massachusetts families who had lost members in the attacks. He <b>pushed</b> <b>through</b> legislation that provided healthcare and grief counseling benefits for the families, and recommended the appointment of his {{former chief of staff}} Kenneth Feinberg as Special Master of the government's September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. Kennedy maintained an ongoing bond with the Massachusetts 9/11 families in subsequent years.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April, the 14th Panzer Division linked up {{with the}} Italians at Vrbovsko, closing the ring around the {{remnants}} of the 7th Army, which surrendered, and the 1st Mountain Division <b>pushed</b> <b>through</b> Novo Mesto and Črnomelj without facing resistance, reaching Vinice {{by the end of the}} day. At Celje, Lanz received a delegation led by Natlačen which included Andrej Gosar. The meeting was very formal and cold, as Lanz had already received orders regarding the break-up of Slovenia into Italian and German-controlled territories, and the council and its goal of an independent Slovenia were superfluous from a German perspective.|$|E

5|$|On 23 November 1984, during {{renovation}} works, {{the station}} suffered a severe fire which burned out the northbound Victoria line platform. It {{is believed that}} the fire was caused by smoking materials being <b>pushed</b> <b>through</b> a ventilation grille into a storeroom where they set several materials on fire. This caused the Victoria line between Warren Street and Victoria to be suspended until 18 December the same year. This incident also led to a smoking ban being introduced on trains in July 1984.|$|E
5|$|Recognising the {{increasing}} congestion in the City and its rapidly growing suburbs, Pearson published a pamphlet in 1845 {{calling for the}} construction of an underground railway through the Fleet valley to Farringdon. The proposed railway would have been an atmospheric railway with trains <b>pushed</b> <b>through</b> tunnels by compressed air. Although the proposal was ridiculed and came to nothing (and would almost certainly have failed if it had been built, due to the shortcomings of the technology proposed), Pearson continued to lobby for a variety of railway schemes throughout the 1840s and 1850s.|$|E
5|$|Replacement {{pilots were}} <b>pushed</b> <b>through</b> an {{abbreviated}} training regimen {{in order to}} meet the short-term needs of the fleet. This led to a sharp decline in the quality of the aviators produced. These inexperienced pilots were fed into front-line units, while the veterans who remained after Midway and the Solomons campaign were forced to share an increased workload as conditions grew more desperate, with few being given a chance to rest in rear areas or in the home islands. As a result, Japanese naval air groups as a whole progressively deteriorated during the war while their American adversaries continued to improve.|$|E

25|$|On March 2011, Phoenix Petroleum Philippines, Inc., a {{petroleum}} {{company from}} the Visayas-Mindanao area {{expressed interest in}} acquiring the Barako Bull franchise. For the sale to <b>push</b> <b>through,</b> an approval from the PBA Board of Governors is needed (7 out of 10 votes). However, the sale did not <b>push</b> <b>through</b> after Barako Bull failed to get the necessary number of votes. Reportedly, the San Miguel Corporation, which owns three teams (San Miguel, Barangay Ginebra and B-Meg Derby Ace) in the league shows concerns should the sale will <b>push</b> <b>through,</b> since they also own a petroleum company, Petron Corporation, which is a direct competitor of Phoenix Petroleum. One of the SMC teams, the San Miguel Beermen, was renamed to Petron Blaze Boosters {{before the start of}} the Governors Cup.|$|R
