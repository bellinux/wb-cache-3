40|$|A novel {{method is}} {{presented}} in this paper to quantitatively define the heat removal of the main fractionator in delayed coking units {{on the basis of a}} fractionating precision diagram (Houghland diagram) and column grand composite curve (CGCC). By referring to the CGCC method, several envelopes are illustrated at draw trays including the top <b>pumparound</b> draw, diesel draw, intermediate <b>pumparound</b> draw and gas oil draw, the energy and material balances are then calculated. Assuming practical near-minimum thermodynamic condition (PNMTC), the minimum liquid reflux flow is zero in the envelope for <b>pumparound</b> trays without product draw and the minimum liquid reflux flow is defined by Houghland diagram for <b>pumparound</b> trays with product draw. The PNMTC-CGCC is constructed by calculating the enthalpy-flow deficit to quantitatively define the heat removal constraints in each envelope. Meanwhile, the corresponding practical heat removal curve is constructed. A case study shows that the high temperature heat removal ratio within the main fractionator increased by 8 %. The proposed method offers heat removal inequality constraints for the model to optimize the heat integration between the main fractionator and the heat exchanger network. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In {{this study}} a new reactor design is {{proposed}} {{to control the}} pH during the bio-electrochemical denitrification process. A previously developed UBER was modified by including a <b>pumparound</b> system. With the <b>pumparound</b> system {{a portion of the}} treated water is continuously withdrawn from the UBER into a CO 2 sparging bottle to decrease its pH to about 6. 1 Â± 0. 1, before being returned to the cathode zone where denitrification process takes place. Continuous denitrification was studied with a HRT of 24 h applying an electric current in the range of 15 - 25 mA. The effects of circulation flow rate (F c) on the pH and on the concentrations of nitrate and nitrite ions in the effluent were investigated. The <b>pumparound</b> system succeeded to stabilize the cathode pH around 7 - 8 through alteration of circulation flow rate (F c). Complete denitrification with no trace of nitrite was therefore achieved at circulation flow rate of 0. 7 mL/min and electric current 25 mA. A further investigation in absence of bicarbonate sodium resulted in a satisfactory nitrate treatment showing that the carbon dioxide gas dissolved in the CO 2 sparging bottle supplied enough carbon for the autohydrogenotrophic microorganisms...|$|E
40|$|Steady-state {{and dynamic}} {{simulation}} of Preflash and Atmospheric column (Pipestill) {{in a real}} crudeoil distillation plant was performed using ASPEN simulations. Steady-state simulation resultsobtained by ASPEN plus were compared to real experimental data. Experimental ASTM D 86 curvesof different products were compared to those obtained by simulations. Influence of the steam flowrate in the side stripers and of the heat flow removed in <b>pumparounds</b> was analyzed. Significantinfluence of the heat flow removed in <b>pumparounds</b> on the flow conditions in the column and onthe product composition is explained. Steady-state flowsheet was completed by dynamic simulation requirements and exported to ASPENDynamics for simulations in dynamic mode. The behavior of the products flow rate in dynamicregime was observed after changing the crude oil feed by 10 %. Two different control methodsbased on composition (ASTM D 86 95 % boiling point) and temperature at the second stage wereapplied in dynamic simulation. The time needed to reach a new steady-state, deviation, and abilityof reaching the preset parameters of both methods were compared...|$|R
50|$|Large-scale {{industrial}} fractionation towers use reflux {{to achieve}} more efficient separation of products. Reflux {{refers to the}} portion of the condensed overhead liquid product from a distillation tower that is returned to {{the upper part of the}} tower as shown in images 3 and 4. Inside the tower, the downflowing reflux liquid provides cooling and partial condensation of the upflowing vapors, thereby increasing the efficacy of the distillation tower. The more reflux that is provided, the better is the tower's separation of the lower boiling from the higher boiling components of the feed. A balance of heating with a reboiler at the bottom of a column and cooling by condensed reflux at the top of the column maintains a temperature gradient (or gradual temperature difference) along the height of the column to provide good conditions for fractionating the feed mixture. Reflux flows at the middle of the tower are called <b>pumparounds.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{crude oil}} plant {{consists}} of a main column with several sidestripers and <b>pumparounds.</b> While steady state modeling and simulation is fairly standard today, using well-known software tools as HYSYS platform (ASPEN) and PRO/II environment (Simulation Sciences Inc.), only {{little is known about}} the dynamic simulation of crude oil plants intimacy in the open literature. Due to the process complexity, the references in this field mention many difficulties in building-up a dynamic model for this multi-component distillation (as first step in the dynamic simulator implementation), model that could be appropriate for numerical integration [1, 2]. The presented model is based on pseudo-components and makes use of the well-known MESH equations, in an original approach following topological and functional rules. Additional simplifications result in a robust dynamic model with reasonable accuracy, without affecting the “full-scale ” model feature. This first part of the work presents the detailed mathematical model, explicitly oriented to numerical integration within an appropriate simulation environment...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn Part I of this paper, it {{was shown}} on {{thermodynamic}} grounds that introducing a flash in the preheating train of an atmospheric oil distillation process, together with an appropriate introduction of the resulting vapour into the column, could potentially bring substantial energy savings, by reducing {{the duty of the}} preheating furnace, by doing some pre-fractionation and by reducing the column irreversibilities. Part II expands on this idea by showing how this can be done while keeping the throughput and the product characteristics unchanged. The outcome is that placing several flashes after the heat exchangers and feeding the corresponding vapour streams to the appropriate trays of the column reduces the <b>pumparound</b> flows and the heat brought to the preheating train. The resulting heat deficit may then be compensated in an additional heat exchanger by using low level heat recuperated from the products of the distillation and/or imported from other processes. The use of this residual heat reduces the furnace duty by approximately an equivalent amount. Thus high level energy (fuel-gas burnt in the furnace) is replaced by residual low level heat. The simulation with an example flowsheet shows that the savings on fuel could be as high as 21 %...|$|E
40|$|Heat {{exchanger}} {{networks in}} process plants recover usable heat from hot to cold process streams such as feedstock, product, and <b>pumparound</b> streams. In this paper, {{we focus on}} the design of a heat exchanger network for removing variable heat from a complex fractionator in delayed coking units. A superstructure-based mixed integer nonlinear programming model is presented to minimize the total annual cost, including the heat exchanger area cost and the utility cost. In the proposed model, duties and operating parameters of pumparounds are optimized and the optimized structure of the heat exchanger network is defined simultaneously. Meanwhile, two modifications are applied to improve the simultaneous optimization model for the integrated system of the complex fractionator and heat exchanger network. First, a predominant calculation method for the log mean temperature difference is introduced in order to obtain the results closest to the actual process; second, nonconstant specific heat of process streams with pseudocomponents is considered to represent real thermal properties of process streams in the process model. A case study is carried out to demonstrate simultaneous optimization of the fractionator and heat exchanger network. The optimal design for the model is compared to the one with conventional design heuristics. By applying the proposed model to integrate the operation of the fractionator and heat exchanger network in a delayed coking unit, the total annual cost is reduced by 2. 1 million CNY considering the constraints of the heat removals...|$|E
40|$|As {{energy costs}} {{continue}} to rise across the process industry, many plants have responded by developing improved energy monitoring and reporting programs. At the center of such programs are typically spreadsheet or database applications that pull information, such as fired heater excess oxygen and steam vent rates, from the plant data historian and generate summary reports that compare and trend actual performance relative to targets. On average, plants can expect to reduce overall energy costs by up to 10 % through improved management of plant variables, or metrics, that influence energy consumption. Energy metrics can generally be classified into three categories: Equipment, Utility System, and Process. Examples of each type of metric will be given in the paper. As {{a percentage of the}} overall savings sited above, the energy savings through stewardship and optimization of Equipment, Utility System and Process metrics are generally 50 %, 40 % and 10 %, respectively. Plants have generally {{done a good job of}} stewarding the 90 % of savings available through Utility and Equipment related energy metrics, primarily because target setting is fairly straightforward. However, the 10 % of savings available from Process metrics, such as tower reflux ratios, <b>pumparound</b> rates, and steam stripping ratios, are typically missing from energy management systems due to the difficulty in first identifying them, and second in determining the optimum targets. Target setting is most difficult because with process metrics, yield considerations must be included in the target setting process. It is quite easy, for example, to save energy by cutting tower reflux rates. But too much reduction will sacrifice yield performance. Even at elevated energy prices, even the smallest reduction in yield will typically offset any energy savings that might have been captured. Therefore, in order to effectively incorporate Process energy metrics into the plant energy management system, knowledge of both energy and yield parameters is required. This paper will explore an effective methodology for determining what process unit energy metrics are important, how to effectively set their targets, and how to incorporate them into an effective energy management system. In terms of how to identify process energy metrics, the paper will discuss which energy intensive processes should be examined first, such as crude distillation and cat cracking. In terms of target setting, the paper will describe how process engineering experience is combined with simulation to develop meaningful targets that characterize the point where yield and energy are simultaneously optimized. Finally, the work process require...|$|E
