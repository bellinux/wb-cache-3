40|$|This work {{reports the}} {{performance}} of an energy converter characterized by an emitting parallelepiped element with inside two, three, or five swirling connected combustion chambers. In particular, {{the idea is to}} adopt the heat released by H 2 /air combustion, occurring in the connected swirling chambers, to heat up the emitting surfaces of the thermally-conductive emitting <b>parallelepiped</b> <b>brick.</b> The final goal consists in obtaining the highest emitting surface temperature and the highest power delivered to the ambient environment, with the simultaneous fulfillment of four design constraints: dimension of the emitting surface fixed to 30 × 30 mm 2, solar mode thermal efficiency greater than 20 %, emitting surface peak temperature T > 1000 K, and its relative ∆T 99. 9 %, and high peak temperature, but the emitting surface ∆T is strongly sensitive to the geometrical configuration. The present work is related to the “EU-FP 7 -HRC-Power” project, aiming at developing micro-meso hybrid sources of power, compatible with a thermal/electrical conversion by thermo-photovoltaic cells...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work a general {{approach}} to compute three-dimensional Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) structures is presented. The MMIC {{is taken to}} be of arbitrary geometry, described by orthogonal <b>parallelepiped</b> <b>brick</b> shape ""cells"", each characterized by finite permittivity and conductivity values. The analysis {{is based on a}} full wave approach using integral equation techniques and Method of Moments, while a Galerkin technique is implemented to compute the electromagnetic fields of the structure. Then, transformation of the integral equation system into a linear one takes place, while a Green function is used {{to take into account the}} boundary conditions as well. The unknown electric field inside the cells is expanded in terms of plane waves' superposition using entire domain basic functions. The incident, reflected and transferred waves in the circuit's input and output microstrip transmission lines are described in terms of current distribution. The calculation of the unknown coefficients of the electric fields, including reflection and transfer coefficients, is accomplished by the inversion of the derived matrix. Several numerical results have been computed with various values of the circuit parameters, in simple geometries that represent different longitudinal discontinuity cases. High performance, parallel processing techniques are being utilized to reduce the corresponding computational times as much as possible...|$|E
40|$|This work reports results {{related to}} the “EU-FP 7 -HRC-Power” project aiming at {{developing}} micro-meso hybrid sources of power. One {{of the goals of}} the project is to achieve surface temperatures up to more than 1000 K, with a ∆T ≤ 100 K, in order to be compatible with a thermal/electrical conversion by thermo-photovoltaic cells. The authors investigate how to reach that goal adopting swirling chambers integrated in a thermally-conductive and emitting element. The converter consists of a small <b>parallelepiped</b> <b>brick</b> inside two separated swirling meso-combustion chambers, which heat up the parallelepiped, emitting material by the combustion of H 2 and air at ambient pressure. The overall dimension is of the order of cm. Nine combustion simulations have been carried out assuming detailed chemistry, several length/diameter ratios (Z/D = 3, 5 and 11) and equivalence ratios (0. 4, 0. 7 and 1); all are at 400 W of injected chemical power. Among the most important results are the converter surfaces temperatures, the heat loads, provided to the environment, and the chemical efficiency. The high chemical efficiency, h > 99. 9 %, is due to the relatively long average gas residence time coupled with the fairly good mixing due to the swirl motion and the impinging air/fuel jets that provide heat and radicals to the flame...|$|E
40|$|A polycube in {{dimension}} d is {{a finite}} union of unit d-cubes whose vertices are on knots of the lattice Z d. We show that, for each family of polycubes E, {{there exists a}} finite set F of <b>bricks</b> (<b>parallelepiped</b> rectangles) such that the bricks which can be tiled by E are exactly the bricks which can be tiled by F. Consequently, if we know the set F, then we have an algorithm to decide in polynomial time if a brick is tilable or not by the tiles of E...|$|R
