The eastern half was built from scratch, having never previously been a trolleybus route.

Most works were completed in 2006, but the line's opening was delayed. In the meantime, the planned line 14 had been extended, by the addition of two branches on the eastern section: 14A (the main line) to the end of Via Due Madonne (depot) and 14C to the end of al Pilastro (as well as a third branch, 14B, for the Roveri industrial area, to operate only in the morning rush hour).|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} of a hadron–quark phase transition in extreme astrophysical phenomena such as {{the collapse of a}} supernova is motivated from our present knowledge of the high-energy nuclear and quark-matter equations of state. Both the density and the temperature attainable in such extreme processes are possibly high enough to trigger a chiral phase transition. However, the time scales involved are an important issue. Even if the physical conditions for the phase transition are favorable (for a system in equilibrium), there may not be enough time for the dynamical process of <b>phase</b> <b>conversion</b> to be completed. We analyze the relevant time scales for the <b>phase</b> <b>conversion</b> via thermal nucleation of bubbles of quark matter and compare them to the typical astrophysical time scale, in order to verify the feasibility of the scenario of hadron–quark <b>phase</b> <b>conversion</b> during, for example, the core-collapse of a supernova...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the rate of heating on {{the position of the}} critical points of iron-cobalt alloys was studied. It is shown that when an alloy with 8 % Co by weight is heated at the rate of 7000 deg/sec, a shift in the temperature of <b>phase</b> <b>conversion</b> of almost 30 deg occurs. When an alloy with 15 % Co by weight is heated at the same rate, the conversion temperature is shifted by approximately 20 deg. For an alloy with 15 % Co by weight, for which under ordinary conditions of heating the points of <b>phase</b> <b>conversion</b> and magnetic randomization (the Curie point) coincide, it was possible to show that for high rates of heating, a separation with respect to temperature occurs which clearly confirms the fact of the shift in the critical points of <b>phase</b> <b>conversion...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} accounts in Farm Account Scheme (FAS) format of two Scottish farms in Organic conversion are examined and compared to Scottish average data. Farm 1 {{is a family}} run mixed farm with cereals, seed potatoes, cattle and sheep. Conversion has been phased with conversion ground in grass and set-aside, while cereals and potatoes have been grown conventionally until they could be grown organically. Cereal area was reduced so that livestock numbers and potato area could be maintained. The <b>phased</b> <b>conversion</b> plus organic aid payments has maintained the above average profitability although good prices for organic malting barley and seed potatoes have helped but these premiums may not be maintained. Farm 2 is an all grass dairy farm with two 150 cow pedigree Holstein herds on a high input high output system now 9 months into conversion. The two herds were reduced and merged on to one site to form one 200 cow herd. This released capital and labour was reduced by one man saving fixed costs, while yield per cow increased with only the grass in conversion. The challenge will be to maintain yield and profitability on organic feeds. The results to date show that with organic aid and careful planning of conversion and structural changes profitability can be maintained. Farm Management,...|$|E

Contrary to earlier suggestion, neither high spin nor strain of the transition metals is found to be responsible for this <b>phase</b> <b>conversion.</b> The driving mechanism, instead, is attributed to the increased interaction between Co and Ni atoms forming a linear chain in the rutile phase.

40|$|Cementing systems {{based on}} calcium {{aluminate}} cement (CAC) {{have been studied}} as an alternative cement matrix for the encapsulation of intermediate level wastes (ILWs) arising from the nuclear industry. Calcium aluminate cement based systems have great potential for the incorporation of aluminium containing ILW owing to the near neutral internal pH of these binders. However, CAC based binders usually undergo <b>phase</b> <b>conversion</b> from the metastable hydration phases C 3 AH 6 and/or C 2 AH 8 to the stable C 3 AH 6, resulting in strength regression and dimensional instability. The present study investigates the feasibility of CAC modification to prevent this detrimental process of <b>phase</b> <b>conversion.</b> Two different types of sodium phosphates are used to modify a CAC system, and the setting behaviour and the mineralogy of the binder products were studied. It is shown {{that it is possible}} to avoid the conventional <b>phase</b> <b>conversion</b> of CAC hydrates due to the formation of an amorphous aluminate phase in place of the metastable hydrates, leading to the production of a phase assemblage, which is stable for at least 180 days...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the scenario of homogeneous nucleation {{for a first}} order quark-hadron phase transition in a rapidly expanding background of quark gluon plasma. Using an improved preexponential factor for homogeneous nucleation rate, we solve a set of coupled equations to study the hadronization and the hydrodynamical evolution of the matter. It is found that significant supercooling is possible before hadronization begins. This study also suggests that spinodal decomposition competes with nucleation and may provide an alternate mechanism for <b>phase</b> <b>conversion</b> particularly if the transition is strong enough and the medium is non viscous. For weak enough transition, the <b>phase</b> <b>conversion</b> may still proceed via homogeneous nucleation...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the process of}} <b>phase</b> <b>conversion</b> in a thermally-driven weakly first-order quark-hadron transition. This scenario is physically appealing even if {{the nature of this}} transition in equilibrium proves to be a smooth crossover for vanishing baryonic chemical potential. We construct an effective potential by combining the equation of state obtained within Lattice QCD for the partonic sector with that of a gas of resonances in the hadronic phase, and present numerical results on bubble profiles, nucleation rates and time evolution, including the effects from reheating on the dynamics for different expansion scenarios. Our findings confirm the standard picture of a cosmological first-order transition, in which the process of <b>phase</b> <b>conversion</b> is entirely dominated by nucleation, also {{in the case of a}} weakly first-order transition. On the other hand, we show that, even for expansion rates much lower than those expected in high-energy heavy ion collisions, nucleation is very unlikely, indicating that the main mechanism of <b>phase</b> <b>conversion</b> is spinodal decomposition. Our results are compared to those obtained for a strongly first-order transition, as the one provided by the MIT bag model.

Equivalent hydrodynamic and transport parameters provide a common basis for the comparison. The differences in the gas <b>phase</b> <b>conversions</b> predicted by these models are insignificant. However, the two models predict very different values of selectivities for the intermediate products.

In this study, rapid calcification of deer antlers was studied to unravel bone biology by investigating mineral composition, morphology and microstructure.
