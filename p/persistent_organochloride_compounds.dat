40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{degradation of}} different glyphosate herbicide formulations on RuO(2) and IrO(2) DSA(A (R)) electrodes is investigated. Parameters that could influence {{the formation of}} <b>organochloride</b> <b>compounds</b> during electrolysis are studied. The effects of chloride concentration, electrodic composition, current density, and electrolysis time are reported. The influence of the oxide composition on herbicide degradation seems to be almost insignificant; however, there is a straight relationship between anode composition and organic halides formation. Commercial herbicide formulations have lower degradation rates and lead {{to the formation of}} a larger quantities of <b>organochloride</b> <b>compounds.</b> In high chloride concentrations, there is a significant increase in organic mineralization, and the relationship between chloride concentration and organic halides formation is direct. Only in low chloride medium investigated the organochloride concentration obtained was below the limit values allowed in Brazil. The determination of organic halides absorbable (AOX) during electrolysis increases significantly with the applied current. Even during long-term electrolysis, a large amount of <b>organochloride</b> <b>compounds</b> is formed. FAPESPCNPqMS-CAPES fellowshi...|$|R

Their ability to degrade made them an attractive alternative to the <b>persistent</b> <b>organochloride</b> pesticides, such as DDT, aldrin, and dieldrin. Although organophosphates degrade faster than the organochlorides, the greater acute toxicity of OPPs result in the elevated risk associated with this class of compounds (see the Toxicity section below).|$|R
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} oxidation of acid black 210 dye (AB- 210) on the boron-doped diamond (BDD) was investigated under different pH conditions. The best {{performance for the}} AB- 210 oxidation occurred in alkaline phosphate solution. This is probably due to oxidizing agents such as phosphate radicals and peroxodiphosphate ions, which can be electrochemically produced with good yields on the BDD anode, mainly in alkaline solution. Under this condition, the COD (chemical oxygen demand) removal was higher than that obtained from the model proposed by Comninellis. Electrolyses performed in phosphate buffer and {{in the presence of}} chloride ions resulted in faster COD and color removals in acid and neutral solutions, but in alkaline phosphate solution, a better performance in terms of TOC removal was obtained in the absence of chloride. Moreover, <b>organochloride</b> <b>compounds</b> were detected in all electrolyses performed in the presence of chloride. The AB- 210 electrooxidation on BDD using phosphate as supporting electrolyte proved to be interesting since oxidizing species generated from phosphate ions were able to completely degrade the dye without producing <b>organochloride</b> <b>compounds.</b> (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Setline and angling {{techniques}} {{were used to}} sample 56 white sturgeon Acioenser transmontanus from the Kootenai River in 1991. Of those sampled, nine were recaptures from previous years of this study. A total of 382 white sturgeon were captured from March 1989 through October 1991. Fork lengths of white sturgeon in the sample ranged from 88 - 274 cm. Our data indicated there was a complete lack of recruitment of juveniles into the population. The youngest fish sampled was of the 1977 year class. The population was estimated at 880 individuals with a 95 % confidence interval of 638 to 1, 211. Annual mortality of white sturgeon since 1982 is 3. 74 %. Approximately 80 % {{of the population was}} more than 20 years old and was reproductively mature. Surgical examination of 309 white sturgeon since 1989 indicated that approximately 7 % of the female white sturgeon and 30 % of the male white sturgeon are reproductive each year. The ratio of males to females was estimated at 1 :l. White sturgeon sampled and released with and without surgical examination were recaptured at equal rates. An ongoing sonic telemetry study has documented long distance movements by adults. White sturgeon regularly move across the British Columbia - Idaho border. White sturgeon seek out deep holes in the river or migrate to Kootenay Lake during late fall, During spring and early summer of both 1990 and 1991 reproductively mature white sturgeon moved from 15 to 110 km upriver and congregated within 10 km downriver from Bonners Ferry in areas of elevated water velocity. This behavior coincided with increasing discharge and water temperatures. Developing white sturgeon eggs were recovered from the river near Bonners Ferry on July 3, 1991. Contamination of eggs by <b>organochloride</b> <b>compounds</b> were less in recent samples from the Kootenai River than in a single sample collected in 1982.

40|$|Declines in {{populations of}} wild animals are often natural cyclic {{phenomena}} {{that may be}} dependent on food supply, weather conditions, environmental changes or other factors. The population decreases are usually transient and breeding animals and offspring revert to previous numbers within several years. The impact of man in reducing habitats of animals, mainly forests, has caused a gradual decline in populations of many animals, mainly birds. Birds have also been particularly affected by the introduction by man of synthetic chemicals into the environment, often in large quantities, some with prolonged persistence. Populations of 52 % of all migratory raptors are threatened by habitat loss, 21 % by environmental contaminants, and 31 % by direct persecution; 30 % are threatened by two of these factors and 8 % by all three (Zalles and Bildstein, 2000).

5|$|All {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} exposed to compounds that they cannot use as foods {{and would be}} harmful if they accumulated in cells, as they have no metabolic function. These potentially damaging compounds are called xenobiotics. Xenobiotics such as synthetic drugs, natural poisons and antibiotics are detoxified {{by a set of}} xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. In humans, these include cytochrome P450 oxidases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and glutathione S-transferases. This system of enzymes acts in three stages to firstly oxidize the xenobiotic (phase I) and then conjugate water-soluble groups onto the molecule (phase II). The modified water-soluble xenobiotic can then be pumped out of cells and in multicellular organisms may be further metabolized before being excreted (phase III). In ecology, these reactions are particularly important in microbial biodegradation of pollutants and the bioremediation of contaminated land and oil spills. Many of these microbial reactions are shared with multicellular organisms, but due to the incredible diversity of types of microbes these organisms are able to deal with a far wider range of xenobiotics than multicellular organisms, and can degrade even persistent organic pollutants such as <b>organochloride</b> <b>compounds.</b>|$|R
50|$|An <b>organochloride,</b> {{organochlorine}} <b>compound,</b> chlorocarbon, or {{chlorinated hydrocarbon}} is an organic compound containing {{at least one}} covalently bonded atom of chlorine that {{has an effect on}} the chemical behavior of the molecule.

40|$|Oxygen, {{although}} an essential molecule for animal life, may become toxic when converted into reactive species, notably during mitochondrial respiration. These compounds react with most cellular components and {{may result in}} cell death or carcinogenesis. Whereas resistance of terrestrial organisms to oxygen toxicity is fairly well studied and understood, notably {{in the framework of}} pathological studies, it is largely unexplored in deep-sea organisms. There, contrasted situations occur. It may be Heaven for pelagic animals with a lowered body temperature and a lesser environmental oxygen concentration, sheltered from photochemical reactions that generate singulet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide in surface seawater. Moreover, respiratory metabolism decreases exponentially with depth. Consequently these animals face a much reduced oxidative stress. Bioluminescence, fairly common in deep sea animals, may be derived from antioxidant defence systems which have become less necessary with the colonization of deep sea. However, these animals could be threatened by pollution, some pollutants such as <b>organochloride</b> <b>compounds</b> generating oxidative stress. But it may be Hell for deep-sea hydrothermal vent animals where high temperatures and elevated concentration of metals and radioactive elements prevail, and where sulfur compounds may counter antioxidative mechanisms. Their enzymatic defences are specific with some enzymes being directed towards oxygen reactive species originating from respiratory metabolism while others could be directed towards exogenous threats. © Institut océanographique, Fondation Albert Ier, Prince de Monaco, 2007...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide {{concerns}} of organic pollutant free water supply have attracted significant {{attention to the}} technological advances in water and wastewater treatment. Photocatalysis {{is one of the}} technologies that have been proven to be effective at degrading organic micro-pollutant to noble constituents. This study investigated the selective influence of structural conformations of multi-chlorohalogenated substituted <b>organochloride</b> <b>compounds</b> by TiO 2 as a semiconductor photocatalyst in the heterogeneous photocatalytic and photolytic treatments of organics in aqueous batch systems. The chemical compounds under scrutiny were DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), Chlordane and 2. 3. 4 -TCB (2. 3. 4 -trichlorobiphenyl). Photo-induced oxidation profiles were determined to adhere to structural configuration preferential selectivity in favour of smaller sized molecular compounds, where chlordane achieved the least efficiency in removal. The photocatalytic degradation process indicated partial selectivity against chlordane in favour of DDT and TCB, where maximum efficiencies were recorded for the smaller molecular structure compounds, while chlordane recorded significantly lower efficiency of reduction. The photocatalytic performance relationship was that of impeded photon delivery with increased catalyst mass loading. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood expression was used to model the photocatalytic degradation process, where the adsorption parameters were calculated from photocatalyst isothermal adsorption studies. The reaction kinetic parameters were simulated and estimated using an aquatic systems modelling software.
