5|$|British aero engines were {{normally}} {{equipped with}} a <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> shaft {{that led to the}} rear of the engine. In twin engine aircraft like the Anson, one of these would be used for a generator that powered the aircraft instruments at 24V DC, the other would be left unconnected and available for use. Following a suggestion from Watt to avoid Air Ministry channels, in October Bowen flew one of the Battles to the Metropolitan-Vickers (Metrovick) plant in Sheffield, where he pulled the DC generator off the engine, dropped it on the table, and asked for an AC alternator of similar size and shape. Arnold Tustin, Metrovick's lead engineer, was called in to consider the problem, and after a few minutes he returned to say that he could supply an 80V unit at 1200 to 2400Hz and 800W, even better than the 500W requested. Bowen had an order for 18 pre-production units placed as soon as possible, and the first units started arriving at the end of October. A second order for 400 more quickly followed. Eventually about 133,800 of these alternators would be produced during the war.|$|E
25|$|A 5-speed manual {{transmission}} {{with a very}} low 1st and an overdrive 5th gear was used. A transfer case had a high and low range, a neutral for <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> operation, and engaged the front axle. Axles were Timken double reduction “pumpkin” type.|$|E
25|$|A Fuller 4-speed manual non-synchronized {{transmission}} with a {{very low}} 1st and direct 4th gear was used. A Timken transfer case had a high and low range, a neutral for <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> (PTO) operation, and engaged the front axle. Rear axles were Timken double reduction “pumpkin” type, tractors had heavier rear axles.|$|E

25|$|The Fordson Model N {{replaced}} the Fordson Model F. It was an improved {{variant of the}} F. Production of the Model N started in Cork in 1927. Production of the Fordson Model N was transferred from Cork to Dagenham in 1933. The Model N featured a 27 HP engine, standard rear fenders (mudguards), a higher voltage ignition system, and optional pneumatic tires. In 1935 <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> (PTO) was available as an option on the Model N.|$|E
25|$|Maurice Wilks, Rover's chief {{designer}} {{came up with}} a plan {{to produce}} a light agricultural and utility vehicle, of a similar concept to the Willys Jeep used in the war, but with an emphasis on agricultural use. He was possibly inspired by the Standard Motor Company, who faced similar problems and were producing the highly successful Ferguson TE20 tractor in their shadow factory in Coventry. More likely, he used his own experience of using an army-surplus Jeep on his farm in Anglesey, North Wales. His design added a <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> (PTO) feature since there was a gap in the market between jeeps and tractors (which offered the feature but were less flexible as transport). The original Land Rover concept (a cross between a light truck and a tractor) is similar to the Unimog, which was developed in Germany during this period.|$|E
500|$|On 12 July 2005, whilst {{playing with}} a group of friends on her family farm, her {{trousers}} were caught in the <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> shaft of a tractor that was clearing firebreaks. Her left leg was severed [...] below the knee. The tractor driver died in a bush fire a month later. Her family moved to Australia in 2009 so she could receive better medical assistance. She had further surgery to rectify problems with her leg in early 2011. [...] she lives in Griffith, New South Wales, and resides in Jindabyne during the Australian ski season.|$|E
50|$|Electrical {{systems have}} become very complex, both for engine control and {{monitoring}} the chassis. Controls for <b>power</b> <b>take-offs</b> (PTOs), body operations, snowplow {{and other types of}} auxiliary lighting can be factory installed.|$|R
50|$|Semi-permanently mounted <b>power</b> <b>take-offs</b> {{can also}} be found on {{industrial}} and marine engines. These applications typically use a drive shaft and bolted joint to transmit power to a secondary implement or accessory. In the case of a marine application, such shafts may be used to power fire pumps.|$|R
50|$|Mack trucks {{have been}} sold in 45 countries. The Macungie, Pennsylvania, {{manufacturing}} plant, located near its former Allentown corporate headquarters, produces all Mack products. The Mack MP-series engine, Mack transmissions, the TC-15 transfer cases, and rear engine <b>power</b> <b>take-offs</b> are designed and manufactured in Hagerstown, Maryland, which, according to local historians, was the original factory location.|$|R
2500|$|A {{belt pulley}} was {{standard}} equipment on the WC, while a <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> (PTO) and a mechanical power lift for the cultivator were optional. In 1936 the PTO option's list price was USD $50, the power lift option's, $35.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Power</b> <b>take-off</b> (PTO) was {{integral}} to the Land Rover concept from 1948, enabling farm machinery and many other items to be run with the vehicle stationary. Maurice Wilks' original instruction was [...] "...to have power take-offs everywhere!" [...] The 1949 report by British National Institute of Agricultural Engineering and Scottish Machinery Testing Station contained this description: [...] "the <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> is driven through a Hardy Spicer propeller shaft from the main gearbox output and two interchangeable pinions giving two ratios. The PTO gearbox casing is bolted to the rear chassis cross-member and an [...] belt pulley driven from the PTO shaft through two bevel gears can be bolted to the PTO gearbox casing." [...] PTOs remained regular options on Series I, II and III Land Rovers up {{to the demise of}} the Series Land Rover in 1985. An agricultural PTO on a Defender is possible as a special order.|$|E
2500|$|The Trent 1000 family makes {{extensive}} use of technology derived from the Trent 8104 demonstrator. In order to fulfill Boeing's requirement for a [...] "more-electric" [...] engine, the Trent 1000 is a bleedless design, with <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> from the intermediate-pressure (IP) spool instead of the high-pressure (HP) spool found in {{other members of the}} Trent family. A [...] diameter swept-back fan, with a smaller diameter hub to help maximize airflow, was specified. The bypass ratio has been increased over previous variants by suitable adjustments to the core flow.|$|E
50|$|In 1874 Félix du Temple built a steam-powered {{aeroplane}} {{which took}} off from a ramp with a sailor on board and remained airborne for a short distance. This has sometimes been claimed as the first powered flight in history but the claim is generally rejected because takeoff was gravity-assisted and flight was not sustained. It is however credited as the first <b>powered</b> <b>take-off</b> in history.|$|R
5000|$|The first officially {{authenticated}} take-off {{and landing}} of a man-powered aircraft (one capable of <b>powered</b> <b>take-offs,</b> unlike a glider) {{was made on}} 9 November 1961 by Derek Piggott in Southampton University's Man Powered Aircraft (SUMPAC) at Lasham Airfield. [...] The best flight out of 40 attempts was 650 metres. [...] The SUMPAC was substantially rebuilt by Imperial College with a new transmission system but was damaged beyond repair in November 1965.|$|R

Two-blade propeller. Two {{fuel tanks}} in wings, 225 l (55 US gal) each.|$|R
2500|$|The 567 is {{laid out}} with engine {{accessories}} (oil and water pumps and governors) at the [...] "forward" [...] end and the power take off at the [...] "rear" [...] end. The blowers and camshafts are at the [...] "rear" [...] end of the engine, with the blowers mounted above the power take off."The full line of engines was designed with the same general arrangement, revising basically only the length of crankshaft and crankcase to [...] the required number of cylinders. It appeared that the most satisfactory method of having the engine accessories such as pumps, governor, etc. easily maintained would be to drive them through a gear train at the forward end of the engine, that is, opposite the <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> end. Having {{the location of the}} pumps all {{at one end of the}} engine, called the accessory drive end, fitted very well into locomotive installation. A leaf spring flexible drive gear mounted on the crankshaft was used to eliminate all crankshaft torsional vibration from the gear train."By using either one or two blowers for an 8 or 12 cylinder engine respectively and mounting them above the main generator, it was possible to shorten the overall length of the engine and generator installation. This was one of the main original objectives. The blowers as well as the camshafts were driven at the <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> end of the engine by another gear train." ...|$|E
2500|$|The dump had a [...] long [...] {{steel body}} that was raised and lowered by a {{hydraulic}} cylinder and lever arrangement under the body. A <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> on the transfer case, {{used with the}} transmission in gear, drove the hydraulic pump, the controls were inside the cab. The body had a tailgate that hinged from either the top or bottom. When the tailgate was hinged at the top the bottom could be opened while dumping with a lever on the left front corner of the body, just behind the driver's window. The front of the body had a stone-shield that covered the cab and the spare tire mounted between the cab and body.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first ever}} series {{production}} DCT was the Volkswagen Group DQ250 six-speed dual-clutch transmission, with dual concentric wet multiplate clutches. [...] It was produced at the Group's Kassel plant under exclusive license from BorgWarner {{for use in}} transverse powertrain installations, of either front-wheel drive or four-wheel drive (4WD) layouts. The 4WD versions are fundamentally identical to the FWD versions, but the 4WD versions use an additional bolt-on <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> unit to direct engine torque to the Haldex Traction rear axle. [...] This DQ250 variant is used {{in a wide range}} of models: Volkswagen Passenger Cars (Polo, Golf/Rabbit/Golf Plus, Scirocco, Jetta, Eos, Passat, and Touran); Audi cars (A3, and TT); SEAT cars (Ibiza, León, Altea, and Toledo); Škoda cars (Octavia and Superb); and Volkswagen commercial vehicles (Caddy and T5 Transporter).|$|E

50|$|In April 1963, the National Defense Council {{decided to}} develop a {{prototype}} of an armoured personnel carrier equipped with Romanian automotive components. These auto parts were successively installed in the hull of a Soviet BTR-60P (also known as the GAZ-49) at different factories of the local automotive industry. The experimental prototype, designated T.A.B.-63, was equipped with two local-made SR-213 engines, two gearboxes, two transfer cases, two drive shafts, two <b>power</b> <b>take-offs,</b> brakes, hydraulic pumps, parts of the electric system, parts of the centralized tire air pressure control system {{and a number of}} support elements of the armoured hull.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} an approach whereby small unmanned aircraft can land and perch on outdoor walls. Our prototype uses an ultrasonic sensor {{to initiate a}} pitch-up maneu-ver as it flies toward a wall. As it begins to stall, it contacts the wall with compliant “feet ” equipped with rows of miniature spines that engage asperities on the surface. A nonlinear hierarchical suspension absorbs the kinetic energy and controls contact forces in the normal and tangential directions to keep spines engaged during the landing process. Future work will include <b>powered</b> <b>take-offs</b> and maneuvering {{in contact with the}} wall. ...|$|R
2500|$|The wrecker had a Holmes twin-boom {{design with}} a {{swinging}} boom and powered hoist cable on each side. When towing the booms were rotated to the rear, connected at the ends, {{and worked as}} one A-frame. When lifting the booms could be separated and rotated 90% forward to the side, an outrigger could be lowered to increase lifting capacity. A <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> on the transfer case drove a transmission with two winches in the wrecker frame. Controls {{on both sides of}} the body allowed each winch to raise or lower independently of the other. The body had low sides on the rear half which tapered to the floor in the front, making clearance for the boom to swing. A brace for the wrecker frame held a spare tire. Welding tanks, an air compressor, cables, block and tackle, chains, tow-bars, and other equipment were carried.|$|E
2500|$|Traditional hay {{making in}} the Boho was a {{communal}} endeavour. Neighbours of the farmer and his family would gather round to help [...] "win" [...] the hay before any sign of rain. This was a long and arduous job compared to the modern process. Local people might even {{take a day off}} their regular job for this sole purpose. The meadow was cut using a scythe (originally), and then in more modern times by tractor with a side-mounted mower blade. The grass swathes would be turned over by means of a hay rake and if the grass was dry enough it would be [...] with a pitchfork. The person that was tedding would lift as much as he/she could with a pitchfork and then shake it out vigorously over the ground. Once the grass was dry enough, the loose hay would be gathered into rows with hay rakes (this tedding might be repeated depending on how dry the grass was). The rows could also be made into small [...] "laps" [...] or [...] "lappins" [...] which are circularised stacks of dried grass. The invention of a hay-right or tedding machine connected to the <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> (PTO) of a tractor made tedding a lot less labour-intensive.|$|E
