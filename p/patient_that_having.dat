50|$|<b>Patients</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> had {{invasive}} {{brain surgery}} or procedures {{are considered to}} be the most at risk for experiencing ventriculitis. Two procedures, in particular have been studied extensively due to their high rate of ventriculitis contractions post operation. The first group consists of <b>patients</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> had an external ventricular drain implanted to allow physicians to reduce the intracranial pressure they experience. The duration that the drain is implanted varies by necessity, however, the longer the drain is in, the more likely an infection will occur. The second group consists of <b>patients</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> an implanted intracranial stent. Both groups of patients have a much higher rate of ventriculitis than the general populace, though there is very little supporting evidence {{due to the lack of}} definition of ventriculitis as frequent misdiagnosis. Nearly 25% of patients with an external ventricular drain experience infection-based meningitis or ventriculitis.|$|R
