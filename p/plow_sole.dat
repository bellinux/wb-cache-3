40|$|This study investigates {{percolation}} and seepage {{through the}} bunds of flat and terraced paddies. Field experiments {{were conducted in}} Hsin-Pu of Hsin-Chu County, Taiwan, to measure the soil water content of various types of bund. Measurements revealed that the soil was unsaturated along the sloped surface of the terrace. Experimental results also indicated that seepage face flow did not develop even after 2 days of heavy rainfall. A three-dimensional model, FEMWATER, was adopted to simulate percolation and lateral seepage under various bund conditions. In a flat paddy, the rate of percolation of bunds under which a <b>plow</b> <b>sole</b> was located, was 0. 40 cm d 21, close to the average infiltration rate of a flooded paddy. The percolation of the bund without <b>plow</b> <b>sole</b> was 0. 85 cm d 21, or double the average infiltration rate of a flooded paddy. Infiltration in the central area of a terraced paddy is mainly vertically downward, whereas flow near the bund is predominantly lateral. The paddy field near the bund has a high hydraulic gradient. The simulated infiltration flux into the bund (1. 47 cm d 21) after 85 days of rice cultivation exceeded that into the central area (0. 54 cm d 21) {{by a factor of}} 2. 72. The final percolation flux from the bund (1. 24 cm d 21) also exceeded the final percolation from the <b>plow</b> <b>sole</b> (0. 68 cm d 21) by a factor of 1. 82. The lateral seepage fluxes through the bund, downward and upward along the slope surface, are 2. 01 and 22. 12 cm d 21, respectively. However, the lateral seepage flux does not fully saturate the surface of the hillside soil. A simulation clearly shows that the seepage upstream of the paddy field does not move water downstream and is reused as subsurface return flow. Both experimenta...|$|E
40|$|Paddy is {{commonly}} grown under flooded or submerged {{condition in which}} substantial amount of water is lost by different processes. Puddling is traditionally done to reduce water loss from lowland rice fields. Since the very step of puddling, rice root zone undergoes structural changes leading {{to the formation of}} a layered profile having a hydraulically less-conductive <b>plow</b> <b>sole</b> below the root zone. However, studies have shown that soil cracking and the presence of preferential flow paths in puddle fields defeat this purpose. Description of soil water regime in such a dynamic soil requires an in situ measurement method for soil hydraulic properties. A field experiment was conducted in twelve 30 m 2 plots during the rainy seasons (June to October) of 2004 and 2005 to evaluate a suitable method for estimating soil hydraulic properties of lowland paddy soil. Results showed that piezometric (pressure) heads installed in different soil layers responded to the drying and wetting cycles typically followed in transplanted rice and are observed as a part of monsoon climate in eastern India. The Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm built in the HYDRUS- 1 D simulation environment was used to inversely estimate soil hydraulic parameters. Estimated parameters revealed larger hydraulic conductivity for the compacted <b>plow</b> <b>sole</b> than those published in literature, which may have resulted from alternate wetting and drying typically observed under monsoon climate and earthworm burrows observed in our experimental field. Results from simulation studies suggest that both the single- and dual-porosity models could simulate water flow considerably well in lowland paddy field although the latter described pressure head time series data slightly better in about 50 % of simulations. Similar performance of the single- vs. dual-porosity model may have resulted from estimating a seasonally mean soil hydraulic properties which include the effect of both preferential flow and matrix flow as the specific soil and boundary conditions prevailed. While water may have preferentially transported through the macropores during the wetting cycles in a near-saturated soil, it would have dominantly moved through soil matrix during the drying cycles. This study shows that simple piezometers may be combined with a simulation model to estimate hydraulic properties of different soil layers in a lowland paddy field.

40|$|A {{riparian}} vegetated {{buffer strip}} is employed to intercept surface runoff, wastewater, surface and groundwater flows from upland {{sources for the}} purpose of reducing sediment, nutrient pollutants and other organic pollutants before they can entersurface waters and groundwater recharge areas. It is very importantto control the agricultural nonpoint source pollutants(ANSP) along theChi-Chia-Wang Creek for protecting the habitat of Taiwan Trout, {{which is one of the}} endangered species through artificial propagation in Taiwan. This study is to estimate the suitable width of vegetated buffer strip in the riparian of the creek using topographic analysis and attenuation model. The creek is susceptible to pollution because of high saturated hydraulic conductivity and excessive use of fertilizers in its nearby upland agricultural farmlands. The width of buffer strip varies with nutrient attenuation of soil layers. The estimated width of buffer strip calculates from potassium attenuation in the vegetable plot is the widest due to easy movement of potassium in the soil. This width can be recommended for maxium prventing of creek pollution by ANSP. The <b>plow</b> <b>sole</b> with more silt and/or clay content in the vegetable plot has the functioning of high adsorption capacity and low infiltration rate. Therefore it is a good buffer layer to decrease the potential pollution to groundwater. Besides, the placement of buffer strip, best management practices(BMP) should be considered in the farming slopeland. 植生緩衝帶具有緩衝污染物、安定河岸等多項功能，為有效解決坡地農業 所產生之非點源污染。七家灣溪為國寶魚櫻花鉤吻鮭魚之棲地，溪岸農業 非點源污染之防治極為重要。本研究係以土壤、地形分析配合營養鹽類在 土層中之衰減曲線及指標模式，推估植生緩衝帶適宜之配置寬度。試區表 土層土壤之飽和水力傳導度極高，溪畔農地肥料大量使用之結果，土層中 營養鹽易隨降雨及灌溉水之入滲進入土體。植生緩衝帶寬度係隨各類營養 鹽在土層中之衰減率而異，營養鹽中以鉀之移動性較大，所推估之緩衝帶 較寬，若以蔬菜區土層中鉀之衰減率作為緩衝帶寬度之推估，其配置寬度 方能有效防止營養鹽在七家灣溪之污染。蔬菜區之犁底層含多量坋粒及粘 粒，其對於營養鹽有較大之吸附能力及減緩土壤之入滲作用，可減少營養 鹽污染地下水。除了植生緩衝帶之配置外，集水區主要潛在污染源之農作 區內，應落實草生栽培、草溝、及農塘之設計...|$|E
40|$|As an {{ice sheet}} slides over its {{sediment}} bed, some clasts partly {{embedded in the}} glacier <b>sole</b> <b>plow</b> through the bed surface. The size distribution of such clasts, {{if it can be}} characterized from structures in the geologic record, can be used to estimate the sliding velocity of a past ice sheet. By combining a theory of glacier sliding with a geotechnical theory of cone penetration, sliding velocity can be calculated in terms of clast-size parameters, a fluidity parameter for ice, and the thermodynamic properties of ice and clasts. If frictional properties of the bed are measured, the effective normal stress on the bed and bed shear strength during glaciation can also be calculated. We used this approach to estimate the sliding velocity of an Illinoian ice sheet that left plowing structures in cemented outwash near Peoria, Illinois. Fluidity parameters for normal and basal temperate ice yielded sliding velocities of 140 – 168 m yr− 1 and 60 – 72 m yr− 1, respectively. These are overestimates if solutes impeded regelation of ice past clasts or if friction between debris-laden ice and clasts retarded slip. Preconsolidation stresses determined in laboratory tests on silt from the bed agree with effective normal stresses calculated using clast-size parameters. The high shear strength of the bed (3 ̆e 145 kPa) and primary structures preserved within it indicate that additional movement due to pervasive shear of the bed was unlikely. Application of this method elsewhere would provide basal velocity data that are otherwise unavailable for testing and tuning of ice sheet models...|$|R

The advertisement reads as follows: "Aerocultor (Cultivates the soil by air) Aearoculture is a patented mechanical process of injecting pure air into the soil. It is done under pressure and to depths up to four feet by especially designed equipment. The oxygen and nitrogen of the air is thus delivered {{to the roots of}} growing vegetation. Aeroculture fills the soil in all directions with the life-giving elements so prevalent in the air, and displaces dormant and poisonous gases which have been locked in and under the cultivated soils. Aeroculture granulates compact soils, thus enabling water to penetrate to effective depths. Aeroculture accomplishes the results sought by cultivation and plowing, but at reduced cost. Aeroculture removes sour soil conditions; subsoils without cutting and destroying roots; accomplishes air-slacking of hard pan, <b>plow</b> <b>sole</b> and otherwise impervious soils, where found, in place. Aeroculture stimulates bacterial action necessary for the conversion of natural or artificial fertilizing materials into plant food.

40|$|In May 1950 the Little Nemaha River {{valley in}} the southeastern {{quadrant}} of Nebraska suffered a record-breaking flood. For a short time at the town of Syracuse, the Little Nemaha River, which drained a watershed of 218 square miles, had an estimated discharge of 225, 000 cubic feet per second. This was larger than any flood recorded since 1928 on the Missouri River at Omaha, which drained a watershed of 322, 000 square miles! During this storm and flood twenty-three people lost their lives, fourteen in the Little Nemaha Valley. As night came on, floodwaters swept a commercial bus off a highway northwest of Syracuse; only three of nine in the bus would survive. A young mother and father had their two infant sons torn from their arms as they abandoned their automobile on a nearby minor tributary. At daybreak, sixty miles downriver at Auburn, {{a family of four}} {{on their way to a}} funeral in Kansas had their car stall out on an approach to a bridge over the Little Nemaha. Witnesses saw the waters take them one by one. These deaths were only the most visible manifestations of the disaster. Homes, businesses, vehicles, and domestic livestock were lost. Sloping fields on uplands lost topsoil in depths 2 ̆ 2 up to the <b>plow</b> <b>sole</b> 2 ̆ 2; fields down on the flood plain would be covered at places by five feet of thi topsoil. Railroads, bridges, and roads suffered severe damage. People were stranded in attics as their houses floated downstream; some spent horrifying hours lodged high up in trees, hoping floating debris would miss them. One family between Syracuse and Auburn was barely able to remain safe for seven hours on the tiny island that was the roof of their pickup truck. 2 It was a situation way beyond human control. Most people would consider it a clear example of natural disaster. Here I examine the history of flooding on the Little Nemaha as a case study of human relationships to a common form of natural hazard. Through the history of human responses to a particular river in flood, I also seek understanding of the variety of human roles in creating natural disaster out of this common hazard of flooding. Natural hazards exist when humans have made themselves vulnerable to nature 2 ̆ 7 s forces. As I am using the term, 2 ̆ 2 natural disaster 2 ̆ 2 refers to the situation after the hazard has fulfilled its potentiality, that is, after natural forces have negatively impacted humans. The Little Nemaha affords a useful vehicle for studying these relationships because of its history of repeated flooding. The record-breaking 1950 flood is not important simply as a case of an extreme natural event. It derives part of its instructive power for us (and for Syracuse residents) because people expended such effort protecting themselves from flooding. The lesson residents might have taken from the event was that they could ill afford to ignore a river 2 ̆ 7 s natural propensity to flood. Had they considered this carefully, it might have challenged their confidence in the adequacy of using technology to reengineer natural processes. NATURAL DISASTERS Human complicity in a natural hazard, while being a cause, is also a result; it arises from something else. I argue that one type of natural disaster followed from basic human perceptions toward, and use of, nature. Floods do not start without unusually intense or prolonged precipitation (discounting dam breaks). The record-breaking 1950 Syracuse flood followed from extraordinary (though not record) rainfall amounts on two watersheds that converged on Syracuse at the same time. Other floods on this river also began with good rains, and, in fact, some storms on the river have had greater total amounts, and higher rates of precipitation, than during this flood. While southeast Nebraska is primarily rural without large centers of population, the people who do live in the Little Nemaha Valley have made themselves particularly vulnerable. They have done so through both their settlement patterns (living in a flood plain) and land usage (farming row crops on marginal prairie land). Unfortunately, in arriving at causation for natural disaster, a model of natural disaster as an extreme environmental event meeting a vulnerable human population (as a function of size or usage) is not quite complete. An entry here may be through the phrase 2 ̆ 2 nature is neutral. 2 ̆ 2 Is it not the point that for humans nature is not neutral? It is not neutral on two sides of our event. Nature created conditions which humans found attractive: rich farmland on flood plains and amenable transportation route possibilities. This is not a perceived neutral nature, it is a beneficent nature. And what of the event itself? During or after a flood, nature is anything but neutral. Humans often perceive it as a malevolent force. Nature is an entity divorced from its beneficent aspect in human perception. It calls for responses both immediate and long term. And the repeated experience of flooding in Southeastern Nebraska brought changes in human responses. But the responses also fell within carefully circumscribed limits. I would contend that the inhabitants 2 ̆ 7 responses flowed from their basic perceptions toward, and use of, nature...|$|E
