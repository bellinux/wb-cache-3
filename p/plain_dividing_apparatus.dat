40|$|A <b>divided</b> bar <b>apparatus</b> {{is deemed}} {{to be the most}} {{accurate}} method of measuring the thermal conductivity, λ, (W/mK) of intact rock cores in the laboratory. The divided bar is a steady-state comparative method in which the temperature drop across a disk of rock is compared with that across a disk of standard material of known conductivity. Thermal conductivity test results obtained from rock cores can be used in software programs to determine the design requirements for any medium to large-scale ground-source energy system. This paper describes the design and development of a low-cost <b>divided</b> bar <b>apparatus</b> and compares the values obtained to those achieved by previous researchers and those recommended by EED, a commonly used borehole heat exchanger design software program. The divided bar was designed in accordance with the following principles: keep construction costs low by using readily available materials, develop a simplistic operating procedure to promote continuity of use and cater for the testing of different sized rock cores. As there are currently no recognised testing standards available for operation of a <b>divided</b> bar <b>apparatus,</b> the sample preparation procedure for samples tested on the UCD <b>divided</b> bar <b>apparatus</b> was developed as a proposed standard testing procedure. The proposed procedure amalgamates the developments and suggestions of previous researchers in addition to published test procedures in Ulusay and Hudson (2007), and could possibly contribute towards the development of a standardised procedure for testing on a <b>divided</b> bar <b>apparatus.</b> The test results presented in this paper demonstrate a strong relationship between thermal conductivity and mineral composition with the effects of porosity also having a notable influence on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks...|$|R

Mireuk (Mireuksan (Jeollabuk-do)) {{at the edge of}} the Noryeong Mountains, and northwest the range of Mt. Hamra lead to a series of hills and a great stream that has formed the fertile Okgu plain to the west. Iksan borders Nonsan-gun and Buyeo-gun, Chuncheongnam-do, and is divided by the Keum-gangriver in the north. It faces the Kimje <b>Plains,</b> <b>divided</b> by Mankyeong-gang, to the south.|$|R
50|$|The Eastern Plains {{are part}} of the High Plains, which are the westernmost portion of the Great Plains. The region is {{characterized}} by mostly rolling <b>plains,</b> <b>divided</b> by the South Platte River and Arkansas River valleys. There are also several deciduous forests, canyons, buttes, and a few large natural lakes and rivers throughout the region. The Eastern Plains rise from approximately 3,400 feet at the eastern border of Colorado with Kansas, where the Arkansas River leaves the state, to 7,500 feet east of the Denver Basin.|$|R

The central and southern sections form an extensive <b>plain</b> <b>divided</b> by the Santa Cruz Mountains. A large part of the lowlands is covered by morass, but it still provides grazing land for horses and mules.|$|R
50|$|One example: The tiny unincorporated {{village of}} Beebe <b>Plain,</b> <b>divided</b> by the Quebec-Vermont border, {{is served by}} +1-819-876 Rock Island, Quebec, Canada (a remote station {{controlled}} from Magog) and +1-802-873 Derby Line, Vermont, USA (a remote station controlled from St. Johnsbury). Magog and St. Johnsbury are both a long-distance call from anywhere in Beebe Plain, even though Canadian subscribers can place local calls to Sherbrooke, US subscribers can locally call Newport and an international call within the village is local. An LIR assignment which follows network topology places the Canadian remote station in Magog's LIR, not Sherbrooke's LIR.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002 Elijah Wald {{described}} the village thus: [...] "It is something between {{a small town}} and {{what is known as}} a rancho, a dusty desert hamlet indistinguishable from hundreds of others. The only paved street is the main road to Ciudad Guerrero, itself no more than a country byway, and the town runs along one side of it.

50|$|The {{landscape}} of Mana includes mountains, high forests and <b>plain</b> <b>divided</b> by valleys. Mountains include Weshi and Bebella. Rivers include Aniso, Doha, Wanja, Yebu and Sogibo. A {{survey of the}} land in this woreda shows that 89.1% is arable or cultivable (86.1% was under annual crops), 2.7% pasture, 2.8% forest, and the remaining 5.4% is considered swampy, degraded or otherwise unusable. Khat is an important cash crop. Coffee is another important cash crop for this woreda; over 5,000 hectares are planted with this crop. On 28 September, 2006, the Walta Information Center reported that farmers in this woreda sold 99,850 quintals of washed and unwashed coffee beans, earning 27.3 million Birr.|$|R

40|$|FtsZ plays {{a crucial}} role in {{bacterial}} cell division, and may be involved in plastid division in eukaryotes. To in-vestigate the evolution of the <b>dividing</b> <b>apparatus</b> from pro-karyotes to eukaryotes, the ftsZ genes were isolated from the unicellular primitive red alga Galdieria sulphuraria. Two ftsZ genes (GsftsZI and GsftsZI) were isolated. This suggests that duplication and divergence of the ftsZ gene occurred in an early stage of plant evolution. A compari-son of the FtsZs of G. sulphuraria and other organisms shows that FtsZ is highly and universally conserved among prokaryotes, primitive eukaryotic algae, and higher plants. The GsftsZ 2 gene seems to contain an intron. Southern hybridization analysis of the G. sulphuraria chromosomes separated by CHEF revealed that each ftsZ gene and its flanking region may be duplicated...|$|R

A desire to save was also born in the German experience of political, military, and economic uncertainty.|$|R

50|$|Owing to {{the natural}} qualities, Lajes was always the {{preferred}} residency {{of the rich and}} noble families, resulting in it being referred to as A Madrid dos Açores (The Madrid of the Azores). Many of the estates and lands supported the island of Terceira, and was usually referred as the Celeiro da Terceira (the breadbasket of Terceira). There are also registered several references to {{the quantity and quality of}} the produce in the region, including fruit and wine, in addition to silk production. Lajes is located on a vast fertile <b>plain,</b> <b>divided</b> by hedge rows and where many old signeurial homes still reflect the importance of farming and prosperity of the traditional families of the island. Today, many of the modern roadways that intersect the parish, were once used by farmers to transport goods, usually using the large Ramo Grande oxen, pulling large carts, crafted to transport large, weighty loads, without putting undue stress on the animals. Wood would normally be transported, burned to maintain the warmth during the winter, or for cooking bread in earthen ovens. The oxen, the signeurial homes and agricultural community became known as the Ramo Grande.|$|R
