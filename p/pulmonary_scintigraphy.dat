Between November 2004 and March 2007, DD levels prior to initial treatment were measured in 72 consecutive patients with presumed epithelial ovarian cancer (final diagnosis: epithelial ovarian cancer, n= 60; and epithelial ovarian borderline malignancy, n= 12). Venous ultrasound imaging (VUI) of the lower extremity was conducted for all patients except for two patients in whom DVT was detected by pelvic computed tomography (CT). When DVT was found, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> was subsequently performed to ascertain presence of PTE. D-dimer levels were above the cut-off value (0. 5 [*]μg[*]ml− 1) in 65 of 72 patients (90. 2 %). Venous ultrasound imaging or CT revealed DVT in 18 of 72 patients (25. 0 %) and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> found PTE in 8 patients (11. 1 %).

40|$|AbstractObjectiveInterpretation of lung {{perfusion}} scintigraphy {{in patients}} with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) is difficult, especially {{in the presence of}} chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and most often has to be combined with <b>pulmonary</b> ventilation <b>scintigraphy.</b> We investigated the data from the CT portion of pulmonary perfusion SPECT/CT for possible resolution of this problem. MethodsWe assessed data from 12 patients (4 male, 8 female, mean age 68 y) with perfusion defects, 6 with PE, 6 with COPD. Final interpretation was based on ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy (mismatch or match). Lung tissue density was measured from the CT portion of pulmonary perfusion SPECT/CT. We analyzed 32 areas in mismatch defects (PE), 25 areas in match defects (COPD), and 17 areas without perfusion defects. Perfusion defects cause easily identifiable on X-ray (e. g. effusion) were excluded from the analysis. Data were compared with ANOVA test and Bonferroni post-hoc analysis, p< 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. ResultsThe mean lung tissue density in areas without perfusion defects was − 758 HU, in V/Q mismatch defects (PE) − 695 HU, and in V/Q match defects (COPD) − 900 HU. The differences of lung tissue density was statistically significant (p= 0. 000). ConclusionLung tissue density measured by CT is significantly lower in perfusion defects caused by COPD than in those caused by PE. We believe this data could be used as an adjunct in interpretation of pulmonary perfusion studies and potentially help avoid the performance of ventilation scintigraphy {{in patients with}} suspected PE...|$|R
40|$|Unilateral {{pulmonary}} artery agenesis without any cardiovascular malformation {{is a rare}} anomaly. We present the imaging findings of a patient who was diagnosed as isolated left {{pulmonary artery}} agenesis. A 27 -year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital due to dyspnea during exercise for five years. Chest X-ray revealed minimally small left pulmonary hilum and left lung. She was admitted to our clinic with the suspicion of pulmonary artery pathology. Absent perfusion of the left lung with normal ventilation was visualized on scintigraphy. MDCT angiography of pulmonary arteries showed absent left main pulmonary artery with systemic collaterals around left hemithorax. Pulmonary artery agenesis can be asymptomatic and isolated until adulthood. Both scintigraphy and CT angiography images of pulmonary artery agenesis of a patient are rare in the literature. <b>Pulmonary</b> ventilation- perfusion <b>scintigraphy</b> can be used not only for pulmonary embolism but also pathologies involving pulmonary artery and its branches.

40|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the development of}} new drugs, strict guidelines for the development of new diagnostic methods do not exist. A diagnostic test can be made available without proper evaluation of its clinical utility, which can lead to its premature introduction and inappropriate use. In this review suggestions are made regarding the criteria that should be met during the various phases of development of new diagnostic techniques. It is suggested that a new diagnostic test should only be implemented in routine clinical use after all phases of development have been properly performed with good results. Several diagnostic tests for pulmonary embolism (<b>pulmonary</b> angiography, ventilation-perfusion <b>scintigraphy,</b> D-dimer assays, and spiral computed tomography), and the studies evaluating them, are thereafter reviewed. It is concluded that present pulmonary angiography and ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy are the only properly evaluated diagnostic tests for pulmonary embolism. Although new developments, such as D-dimer assays and the spiral computed tomographic scan are certainly promising, further studies are needed to determine their real value and safety in the diagnostic work-up of patients suspected of pulmonary embolis...|$|R
