5|$|In 1952, the Reverend Francis Dixon of Lansdowne Baptist Church in Bournemouth, England, began hearing several testimonies {{from people}} who became Christians after Jenner accosted them on George Street, Sydney. The {{following}} year, Dixon met with Jenner in Australia and {{told him about the}} <b>people</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> met who had become Christians as a result of Jenner's evangelism, and Jenner, then fifty years old, cried because he had not previously known that even one of the <b>people</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> talked to had remained a Christian beyond their initial profession of faith.|$|E
5|$|The general's objectivity, however, {{has often}} been questioned. Vlahogiannis, in his preface to the Memoirs, praises his honesty and {{contrasts}} it to his lack of objectivity and impartiality. While always straightforward, Makriyannis clearly holds a grudge against <b>people</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> come into conflict with. He often uses disparaging language against people like Kolokotronis, while staying silent about the more questionable deeds of <b>people</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a favourable opinion of. According to Sphyroeras, however, his judgements do not stem from selfishness, but rather from his severity against those he considered were defaming the cause of Greece.|$|E
5|$|He {{was one of}} {{the most}} ambitious and {{promising}} of the young princes of the Kamehameha realm. It is believed by old Hawaiians today that had he lived he would have become a real and constructive leader of the Hawaiian <b>people.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> a splendid physique and a magnetic personality. The glance of his eyes made him friends everywhere.|$|E

5|$|Vang Pao {{himself was}} not {{blind to the}} realities facing his <b>people.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> {{threatened}} to launch a mass migration of the Hmong to Thailand on three previous occasions. In November 1969, he tried a different tack, contacting the Pathet Lao and attempted to negotiate a quid pro quo: the Hmong would cease fighting if the communists {{would allow them to}} establish a semiautonomous state in Xieng Khouang Province.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Dudley was one {{of three}} sons of Edmund Dudley, a {{councillor}} of King Henry VII, and his second wife Elizabeth Grey, daughter of Edward Grey, 4th Viscount Lisle. When he was a toddler, his father was executed by the young Henry VIII as a scapegoat for the former king's financial policies. His eldest brother was John Dudley, later Duke of Northumberland, who sought to advance him in the king's service. Andrew Dudley served in the household of Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, and as an officer of the exchequer in the 1540s. Answering a complaint against exchequer activities in October 1540, Norfolk told the Privy Council that the only two <b>people</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> ever found jobs for were Andrew Dudley and Edward Belingeham.|$|E
5|$|Wright's sermon left a great {{impression}} on Obama, who recounted Wright's sermon {{in detail in}} his memoir Dreams from My Father. Soon after Dreams From My Father was published he went into politics, entering the Illinois Senate. In 2004 he was chosen to deliver the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. In Obama's 2006 memoir The Audacity of Hope, he recollects that on being chosen to deliver this speech, he pondered the topics on which he had previously campaigned, and on major issues then affecting the nation, before thinking about the variety of <b>people</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> met while campaigning, all endeavouring in different ways to improve {{their own lives and}} to serve their country.|$|E

5|$|Dixon then {{travelled}} to Australia {{with his}} wife to engage in itinerant preaching there. Dixon hoped to find Jenner there, although Dixon did not yet {{know the name of}} the man he was looking for. In Adelaide, Dixon told the stories of Culver and Stanton while preaching. Murray Wilkes then approached Dixon and said that he had also become a Christian after having been asked Jenner's question on George Street. At a Methodist church in Perth, Dixon told Culver's, Stanton's, and Wilkes' stories again, and met yet another person who had become a Christian after an encounter with Jenner. Finally arriving in Sydney, Dixon asked Alec Gilchrist of Campaigners for Christ if he knew a man who asked strangers on George Street {{whether or not they were}} headed for heaven or hell. Gilchrist was familiar with Jenner and informed Dixon about how to contact Jenner. Dixon visited Jenner at his house and told him about all the <b>people</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> met who had become Christians because of Jenner's evangelism. Jenner, now fifty years old, had never before heard of even one person living their lives as Christians as a result of his evangelism, and he cried upon hearing that there were several.|$|E

25|$|Whatever {{political}} motivations Wright had {{for reporting}} to American officials, {{he was also}} an American who wanted to stay abroad and needed their approval to have his passport renewed.
