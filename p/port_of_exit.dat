40|$|Abstract Background The order retroviridae {{comprises}} viruses {{based on}} ribonucleic acids (RNA). Some, such as HIV and HTLV, are human pathogens. Newly emerged human retroviruses have zoonotic origins. As far {{as has been}} established, both repeated infections (themselves possibly responsible {{for the evolution of}} viral mutations (Vm) and host adaptability (Ha)); along with interplay between inhibitors and promoters of cell tropism, are needed to effect retroviral cross-species transmissions. However, the exact modus operadi of intertwine between these factors at molecular level remains to be established. Knowledge of such intertwine could lead {{to a better understanding of}} retrovirology and possibly other infectious processes. This study was conducted to derive the mathematical equation of a general theory of the origins of retroviruses. Methods and results On the basis of an arbitrarily non-Euclidian geometrical "thought experiment" involving the cross-species transmission of simian foamy virus (sfv) from a non-primate species Xy to Homo sapiens (Hs), initially excluding all social factors, the following was derived. At the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> from Xy (where the species barrier, SB, is defined by the Index of Origin, IO), sfv shedding is (1) enhanced by two transmitting tensors (Tt), (i) virus-specific immunity (VSI) and (ii) evolutionary defenses such as APOBEC, RNA interference pathways, and (when present) expedited therapeutics (denoted e 2 D); and (2) opposed by the five accepting scalars (At) : (a) genomic integration hot spots, gIHS, (b) nuclear envelope transit (NMt) vectors, (c) virus-specific cellular biochemistry, VSCB, (d) virus-specific cellular receptor repertoire, VSCR, and (e) pH-mediated cell membrane transit, (↓ pH CMat). Assuming As and Tt to be independent variables, IO = Tt/As. The same forces acting in an opposing manner determine SB at the port of sfv entry (defined here by the Index of Entry, IE = As/Tt). Overall, If sfv encounters no unforeseen effects on transit between X y and Hs, then the square root of the combined index of sfv transmissibility (√ |RTI|) is proportional to the product IO* IE (or ~Vm* Ha* ∑Tt*∑As* Ω), where Ω is the retrovirological constant and ∑ is a function of the ratio Tt/As or As/Tt for sfv transmission from Xy to Hs. Conclusions I present a mathematical formalism encapsulating the general theory of the origins of retroviruses. It summarizes the choreography for the intertwined interplay of factors influencing the probability of retroviral cross-species transmission: Vm, Ha, Tt, As, and Ω. </p...|$|E

40|$|African and Caribbean {{countries}} {{pioneered the}} export of fresh tropical fruits and out-of-season vegetables to Europe 30 years' ego but they have since lost a substantial {{share of the market}} to new exporters from Latin America and Asia. Many ACP countries have the climate, soils, water resources and the skills to produce quality products: a determined effort is needed to win back a larger share of what is now an expanding market. Fruit and vegetable production has a multiple role in ACP countries: as a source of food for local markets and for export; as a provider of employment and as a source of foreign exchange. A majority of countries would benefit from increasing their production of horticultural crops. This would raise national nutritional levels and provide a larger production base from which the best quality produce could be selected for export. Several African and Caribbean countries are already engaged in exporting what at first appear to be large quantities of fruit and vegetables: Cote d'Ivoire produces 20, 000 tonnes of mangoes, 200, 000 tonnes of pineapples and 1. 5 million tonnes of bananas each year, mostly for export; the Caribbean is also a major exporter of bananas, Kenya has developed exports of pineapples and French beans, Zambia exports mangetout peas, Burkina Faso exports mangoes and Madagascar exports litchis. However, in world trade terms ACP exports to the EC are both relatively small and heavily reliant on fruit, particularly bananas. Of the nine million tonnes of fresh fruit and vegetables imported into the EC in 1990, 96 % was fruit ando nly 10 % (920, 000 tonnes) was from ACP States. Of this, 46 % came from the Caribbean, 39 % from West and Central Africa and 15 % from East Africa and the Indian Ocean and Pacific States. If bananas, on which the Caribbean countries are highly dependent, are excluded, the total tonnage exported by ACP States was 300, 000 tonnes (3. 3 % of total EC imports), of which only 40, 000 tonnes (0. 45 %) were vegetables. How competitors succeed ACP countries obviously face keen competition, in particular from Central, South American and Asian countries but also from the Mediterranean region. Under the Lome Convention ACP agricultural and horticultural exports have enjoyed an advantage, entering the EC without the tariffs levied on many products from non-ACP producers. But with the eventual prospect of a single market within the EC and the removal of tariffs, ACP exporters must be prepared to produce fruit and vegetables of the highest quality at a competitive price and to supply a consistent volume. Mediterranean and Near-East countries have lower transport costs, being closer to Europe, but Asian and Latin American exporters are more distant than those in Africa. The success of Asian and Latin American exporters has been based on thorough market research to identify consumer preferences, funding of research to develop new, high yielding, flavoursome and visually attractive varieties, and disciplined production and investment in cold storage, transport and marketing promotion. The mango is a fruit which has enormous potential in the European market yet the ACP share of EC imports has dropped from 40 % in 1981 to 18 % in 1990. Meanwhile Central and South American countries, notably Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Venezuela have increased their market share in the same period from 36 % to 61 %. These countries are able to supply the European market for six months of the year, long enough to build up a good business relationship with European importers, whereas the ACP season is much shorter. Major exporters are also constantly monitoring the market and are prepared to abandon varieties or product lines if they recognise that consumer demand is changing or if a competitor develops an unassailable advantage. They are also flexible enough to develop new products rapidly. Meeting the challenge At present 70 % of ACP fruit supply to the EC consists of bananas: pineapple, citrus and coconut make up a further 27 %. All other fruit, i. e. 25, 000 tonnes, comprises only 3 % of the total. Research into the opportunities for extending this 'basket of fruit' needs to be undertaken. COLEACP, the marketing organization responsibile for trade links between ACP countries and the EC is able to assist with advice and market information. The Deputy Director, Mme C. Guichard, believes that challenges can be met and cites several successful examples, particularly {{the export of}} avocado and kiwifruit. Several African and Caribbean countries have risen to the challenges posed by aggressive competitors. Kenya has developed horticultural exports, including French beans, strawberries, avocado, pineapple and carnations, which are now worth US$ 16 million/year. With the decline in coffee prices these products have become an increasingly important source of foreign exchange. Zimbabwe has developed profitable export of mangoes, strawberries, bananas, grapes, citrus and kiwifruit. Cote d'Ivoire has long been a major exporter of pineapples and Ghana is trying now to emulate its neighbour. Burkina Faso exports French beans and mango. Madagascar exports 4200 tonnes of litchis per year 1000 tonnes by air and 3200 tonnes by sea; with an annual production of 35 - 40, 000 tonnes, there is ample scope for increasing the proportion exported. The Agricultural Diversification Coordinating Unit of the Eastern Caribbean States, based in Dominica, is actively pursuing a diversification programme to reduce dependence on bananas, coconut and limes and the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI) is undertaking research to broaden the base of varieties of passion fruit and citrus grown in member countries, and to develop pro auction of new product lines including carambola, soursop and sapodilla. Unfortunately fruit and vegetable research has not been given a high priority in ACP countries over the last 30 years and also there has been a lack of training in horticulture. Dr Linda Wickham, Assistant Dean of Research at the University of the West Indies, Trinidad, believes that research, particularly in the field of post-harvest technology, is essential. She also recognizes the need to educate producers in the Caribbean to recognize that their own criteria for selection of produce - knowledge of keeping and cooking quality and taste rather than appearance - are not those of consumers in Europe, whose priorities are attractive visual appearance, consistent size and absence of blemishes. However, researching new varieties is only a beginning. The European consumer not only has considerable buying power but is also becoming increasingly selective. It is therefore essential that any country wishing to enter that market must ensure that there is a regular supply of consistently high quality produce in pre-determined quantities and at an agreed price. Planning for expansion While there is an urgent need to find new varieties, and even new crops, it is essential that due care is taken not to introduce diseases or pests during transfer of seed or vegetative planting materials. Quarantine regulations must be applied and both exporting and importing countries, as well as farmers, must take responsibility for ensuring exchange of clean planting materials. Pineapple nematodes were accidentally introduced into Ghana when growers embarked on an accelerated programme of planting improved varieties developed elsewhere in the region. Tissue culture, or aerial root propagating material, would have avoided this problem but there are no facilities for tissue culture in Ghana as yet. Sites for new plantations must be chosen with care. Mango plantations, for example, should not be established in humid zones where disease will always remain a problem. And for export crops, the distance between farm and <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> should not be more than 100 km in order to avoid long haulage and the inevitable bruising that results. Increasingly, crops will have to be grown with very strict control over pesticide usage, especially just before or after harvest. With consumer pressure to reduce pesticide residues in food commodities and the tightening of EC laws concerning residues, alternatives to existing spraying regimes and post-harvest treatments must be developed: for example integrated pest management systems incorporating cultural and biological control measures. In the whole chain of production from grower to consumer {{one of the most critical}} links to protect quality is post-harvest storage. For tropical and sub-tropical produce the use of chilling facilities to remove field-heat and to maintain low temperatures during storage and transport is essential. However, the temperatures involved are critical and without reliable equipment and power supplies and well trained staff, all the investment in production may be lost between field or orchard and the supermarket shelf. Nearly every exporter in Zimbabwe has on-farm coldstore facilities to remove field-heat by pre-cooling and storing at the optimum temperature to prevent physiological deterioration. And there has been heavy investment in insulated trucks and cold stores at the airport for holding produce in transit. Multiple retailers (supermarkets) are expanding their share of the retail market throughout the EC and in the UK they now represent 50 % of retail distribution. The demands set by the multiples on their suppliers are high, not only in terms of quality of the product, but also on reliability of supply, volume and delivery schedule. They also expect standards of hygiene adopted by food processing industries and, where fruit or vegetables are being pre-packed, it is essential that the packhouse environment, workers' clothing and hands and any water used for washing all meet the highest standards of public health. Wherever air cargo capacity is available and prices are competitive, airfreight will be preferred for exporting perishable produce. However exporters should target only those countries served by direct flights; when consignments are trans-shipped onto a second flight they are inevitably subjected to a 3 - 5 hour period on the tarmac awaiting loading. In addition, the 'last-on' port of any cargo is vulnerable to last-minute offloads and trans-shipped consignments are the least likely to be put into coldstore facilities at an intermediate airport. Seafreight is a lower cost alternative for less perishable products but again temperature, and even the gases in the atmosphere, have to be controlled. Packaging must also be stronger in order to survive longer journey times, dockside trans-shipments and road or rail distribution on arrival in Europe. Finally, exporters should be aware of changes in packaging regulations in EC member countries. For instance, suppliers to Germany must use only standard pallets and these must be recyclable wherever possible. Where non-returnable pallets are used, they may be made only of untreated wood. Packaging must not include a mix of paper and plastic nor should toxic inks be used. Similar regulations are likely to be implemented throughout the EC. Worth the trouble? Competition is fierce and the standards demanded are high. It will not be easy for ACP countries to maintain, let alone increase, their share of fruit and vegetable exports to Europe. It may also appear easier for large-scale producers to manage production, storage, transport and marketing rather than farmers on smaller acreages. However, the rewards for successful exporters will be a share of a still-expanding market and foreign exchange to make up for reduced income from more traditional exported commodities, many of which are now in over-supply. Countries such as Kenya, Mauritius (see box) and Zimbabwe have also proved that a wide range of horticultural products can be grown to a high standard by small-scale growers: over 80 % of Kenyan producers are small-scale farmers who, with effective technical services provided by government and the private sector, are prepared to accept the challenge of producing for export. Government intervention and investment does not have to be on a large scale but it must be targeted to critical areas. It can be most effective where it plays a regulatory role and facilitates growth through horticultural research, infrastructural development, incentives and support services. In addition, the EC Commission encourages joint research projects and fosters links between ACP States and between ACP States and other countries. In the past new export crops such as fruit and vegetables have often been considered by policy makers to be less important than food crops and traditional export commodities. Now it seems that the rewards for successful trading in fresh produce may be more attractive. But exporting is a team effort and government policy-makers, research scientists, commercial exporters and farmers must be prepared to work together. If serious attention can be given to market research, varietal development, coldstorage facilities, transport, flexibility and marketing promotion, ACP countries have much to gain. African and Caribbean countries pioneered the export of fresh tropical fruits and out-of-season vegetables to Europe 30 years' ego but they have since lost a substantial share of the market to new exporters from Latin America and Asia.

The methodological approach adopted to conduct such analysis was developed in two stages. At the first stage, a profit model was estimated for the agriculture sector using econometric tools {{in order to obtain}} structural parameters for projecting the effect of climate anomalies physical on the production of agriculture sector (permanent and temporary crops). At the second stage, this projection is translated as a technological productivity shock into the CGE model to evaluate the general equilibrium effect of climate anomalies. Climate anomalies are defined as deviations of rainfalls over the historic trend and the productivity shock is computed to mimic the climate anomalies observed in 2005. The CGE model used in this study id the well documented B-MARIA model. This model recognizes the 27 Brazilian regions and the results are based on a bottom-up approach ? i. e. national results are obtained from the aggregation of regional results. The model identifies 56 production/investment sectors in each region producing 110 commodities, one representative household in each region, regional governments and one Federal government, and a single foreign area that trades with each domestic region, through a network <b>of</b> <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> and <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> entry. Three local primary factors are used in the production process, according to regional endowments (land, capital and labour). The results show that a general equilibrium approach can provide a better comprehension about the systemic impact of climate anomalies, suggesting the economic costs are higher than those that would be observed in a partial equilibrium analysis. In addition, intersectoral and interregional linkages as well price effects seem to be important transmission channels in the context of systemic impact of climate anomalies...|$|R
50|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, {{there had}} been concern {{about the safety of}} {{shipping}} traffic approaching London from the west (via the English Channel), and a number of canal schemes were put forward. At the same time, much of the packet traffic—urgent messages and small packages from and to foreign locations—used Falmouth as its <b>port</b> <b>of</b> entry and <b>exit,</b> and it was conveyed to and from London by road: a slow and inconvenient journey. An early proposal for a railway came from Robert Johnson and Abel Rous Dottin, member of parliament for Southampton. A prospectus was published on 23 October 1830 gave support to the proposals.|$|R

Although the ship was designed to carry a maximum of 580 passengers and crew, an estimated 1,863 passengers {{are believed to have}} been on board, including 185 people who boarded the ship from Carabane, an island where there was no formal <b>port</b> <b>of</b> entry or <b>exit</b> for passengers. The exact number of all passengers remains unknown (some Senegalese based organizations put the number at over 2,000), but there were 1,034 travelers with tickets. The rest of the passengers were either not required to hold tickets (children aged less than 5) or had been permitted to travel for free, as often happened.|$|R

40|$|This {{publication}} presents {{finding of}} a rapid appraisal of institutions supporting livestock trade and marketing in Somalia. The study was carried to: identify institutions supporting livestock trade and marketing in the country; evaluate the roles played by these institutions in facilitating livestock trade and marketing information flow; application of grades and standards in livestock trade, and livestock export marketing promotional activities; assess {{the level of}} networking among these institutions while facilitating livestock export trade and marketing; analyze constraints faced by these institutions in executing their activities. It was anticipated {{that this will be}} useful in designing supportive infrastructure to enable them play an effective role in improving livestock trade and marketing through enhanced accountability and competence. Emphasis was put on organizations involved in livestock marketing information flow, application of grades and standards in livestock products, and, livestock export promotion. This study identifi ed some forms of organizations supporting livestock export trade in Somalia, viz. brokers, veterinary services delivery systems, port authorities, livestock shipping firms, money transfer services, local government and regional administrations that were in-charge of livestock markets, central government, and a variety of private traders associations. These organisations supported the principal market participants: the small-scale traders, agents of exporters, and exporters in their trial to make effective livestock export trade. The organizations operated under a set of rules and procedures that influenced their activities in facilitating livestock. However, it was noted that there was limited capacity to enforce adherence to some of the rules and regulations by these organizations. This appraisal recognized that although there exist informal grading system based on a number of attributes (age of animal, sex of animal, nutritional status, weight and size, breed and health status), none of the identified institutions was engaged in overt activities to develop further and publicize application of these grades in livestock trade. This was noted to persist despite the general knowledge that suitable grading would significantly promote trade. This appraisal established that currently, the main centre of attention of the public sector is at the <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>exit.</b> In these <b>ports,</b> the government implements a rudimentary animal health certifi cation system, based on clinical inspection of animals prior to loading. There are also some instances of monitoring in some of the secondary markets. Implementation of an effective health and certification system is constrained by limited capacity, both human and physical within the respective institutions and by the absence of a central veterinary administration that is recognized internationally. These constraints need urgent redress to guarantee participation in livestock export trade by Somali traders. It {{is important to note that}} a certification system put in place should also be cost effective and easy to apply in order to be sustainable.

50|$|On October 18, 2016, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) offered Unisys (UIS) {{a five-year}} task order called the Integrated Traveler Initiatives (ITI) to improve {{technology}} integration at agency-operated <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> entry and <b>exit</b> in the United States. The estimated value of ITI contract is $229.7 million if all options are utilized, and the award {{value for the}} initial year is $22.7 million. The Department of Homeland Security’s EAGLE II contract {{is responsible for the}} initiation of the ITI contract. Currently, foreign nationals entering the U.S. are identified with fingerprints by the CBP. Unisys will {{play a significant role in}} implementing biometric checks during departures. The ITI award is the next action in Unisys’ CBP’s Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) and Land Border Integration (LBI) project. As regulated by the WHTI, CBP is required to validate the identity and citizenship of all foreign visitors, using the proper forms of identification. CBP granted Unisys the LBI task order “to design, deploy and maintain a number of new operational solutions that leveraged WHTI technology, processes and systems to secure the nation’s <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> entry.” CBP plans to implement biometric exit procurement in 2017, and requirements include the confirmation of foreign nationals’ departures from the U.S. In addition, Unisys says that LBI and ITI programs will help reduce processing and wait times and provide CBP agents with mobile devices in order to give them more flexibility.|$|R

These factors of influencing the setup <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> width were analyzed from the process of pedestrian evacuation, the capacity <b>of</b> pedestrian passing <b>exit</b> and the strategy <b>of</b> pedestrian selecting <b>exit.</b> It is shown that the setup <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> width {{is dependent on the}} capacity <b>of</b> passing <b>exit,</b> the strategy <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> selection and the total sum, initial site, and aggregation degree of pedestrians in walking facilities. It is also found that the total capacity <b>of</b> passing <b>exits</b> will be low with the number <b>of</b> <b>exits</b> rising under the condition with a fixed total width <b>of</b> <b>exits.</b> The procedure <b>of</b> setting <b>exit</b> was presented to compute the number, site and width <b>of</b> every <b>exit</b> in pedestrian facilities through an example...|$|R
50|$|The {{primary sector}} and {{secondary}} sector both possess different wages, and each sector has different employment characteristics. The two markets are, however, connected with movement between them at specified <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> entry and <b>exit.</b> The {{jobs in the}} primary internal segment are those typical of the core of stable employees in a firm, need long on-the-job training in firm-specific skills, have security and good promotion prospects, a high span of discretion, and high material rewards.4 Professional and skilled craft work requiring occupation-specific rather than firm-specific skills, and often supplied on a contract or self-employed basis. The secondary external segment provides jobs that are low skilled, offer little autonomy and responsibility, low and unstable earnings, and poor working conditions, including casual and seasonal work. The secondary internal sector offers jobs that are generally low grade but with some on-the-job training, security, and promotion prospects. The concepts of primary and secondary labor-markets have now passed into conventional thought, with the primary labor-market commonly understood to mean people with secure jobs and good conditions of work in public-sector employment, the large corporations and highly unionized industries; while the secondary labor-market is understood to cover small employers, non-unionized sectors of the economy, competitive industries such as retailing, where jobs are less secure and conditions of work and pay generally poorest.|$|R
50|$|The {{influence}} and prestige of Seville expanded greatly during the 16th century following the Spanish arrival in America, the commerce <b>of</b> the <b>port</b> driving the prosperity {{which led to}} the period of its greatest splendour. The Puerto de Indias in Seville became the principal port linking Spain to Latin America in 1503 with the monopoly created by the royal decree of Queen Isabella I of Castile; this granted the city exclusive privileges as the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> entry and <b>exit</b> for all the Indies trade. To administer this commercial activity, the Catholic Monarchs founded the Casa de Contratación, or House of Trade, (though it was not then located in a specific building, its documents can now be seen in the Archive of the Indies). From here all voyages of exploration and trade had to be approved, thus giving Seville control of the wealth transported from the New World, enforced by laws regarding the contracting of voyages and which routes the ships must follow. Together the Casa de Contratación and the Consulado de mercaderes (the merchant guild founded in 1543) regulated all mercantile, scientific and judicial intercourse with the New World. Consequently the city grew to over 100,000 inhabitants, making it the largest and most urbanised city in Spain at the time; more of its streets were bricked or paved than in any other in the peninsula.|$|R
