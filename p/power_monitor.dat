40|$|Fine-grained <b>power</b> <b>monitoring,</b> {{which refers}} to <b>power</b> <b>monitoring</b> at the server level, is {{critical}} to the efficient operation and energy saving of datacenters. Fined-grained <b>power</b> <b>monitoring,</b> however, is extremely challenging in legacy datacenters that host server sys-tems not equipped with <b>power</b> <b>monitoring</b> sensors. Installing <b>power</b> <b>monitoring</b> hardware at the server level not only incurs high costs but also complicates the maintenance of high-density server clus-ters and enclosures. In this paper, we present a zero-cost, purely software-based solution to this challenging problem. We use a novel technique of non-intrusive power disaggregation (NIPD) that establishes power mapping functions (PMFs) between the states of servers and their power consumption, and infer the power con-sumption of each server with the aggregated power of the entire datacenter. We implement and evaluate NIPD over a real-world dat-acenter with 326 nodes. The results show that our solution can pro-vide high precision power estimation at the rack level, with mean relative error of 2. 63 %, and the server level, with mean relative er-ror of 10. 27 % and 8. 17 % for the estimation of idle power and peak power, respectively...|$|R
40|$|A {{generalized}} power tracking algorithm that minimizes {{power consumption}} of digital circuits by dynamic {{control of supply}} voltage and the body bias is proposed. A direct power monitoring scheme is proposed that does not need any replica and hence can sense total power consumed by load circuit across process, voltage, and temperature corners. Design details and performance of <b>power</b> <b>monitor</b> and tracking algorithm are examined by a simulation framework developed using UMC 90 -nm CMOS triple well process. The proposed algorithm with direct <b>power</b> <b>monitor</b> achieves a power savings of 42. 2 % for activity of 0. 02 and 22. 4 % for activity of 0. 04. Experimental results from test chip fabricated in AMS 350 nm process shows power savings of 46. 3 % and 65 % for load circuit operating in super threshold and near sub-threshold region, respectively. Measured resolution of <b>power</b> <b>monitor</b> is around 0. 25 mV {{and it has a}} power overhead of 2. 2 % of die power.

40|$|We propose and {{demonstrate}} an ultracompact on-chip photothermal <b>power</b> <b>monitor</b> {{based on a}} silicon hybrid plasmonic waveguide (HPWG), which consists of a metal strip, a silicon core, and a silicon oxide (SiO 2) insulator layer between them. When light injected to an HPWG is absorbed by the metal strip, the temperature increases and {{the resistance of the}} metal strip changes accordingly due to the photothermal and thermal resistance effects of the metal. Therefore, the optical power variation can be monitored by measuring the resistance of the metal strip on the HPWG. To obtain the electrical signal for the resistance measurement conveniently, a Wheatstone bridge circuit is monolithically integrated with the HPWG on the same chip. As the HPWG has nanoscale light confinement, the present <b>power</b> <b>monitor</b> is as short as ~ 3 μm, which is the smallest photothermal <b>power</b> <b>monitor</b> reported until now. The compactness helps to improve the thermal efficiency and the response speed.

30|$|The morphologies {{of samples}} were {{characterized}} using {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM, JEOL- 6700 F). The contour plot of b-Si was sketched out using ImageJ software. The total reflections in the wavelength range 400 – 1000  nm were measured using a spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere to detect all the reflections from the surface. FDTD simulations of the interactions between light and the materials were performed using a commercial program (FDTD solutions, Version 8, Lumerical Solutions). In the simulations, periodic boundaries were applied along the x- and y-boundaries, and perfect matched layers were applied as top and bottom boundaries of the FDTD unit cell. A plane wave light source was set 100  nm above the micropillars; a <b>power</b> <b>monitor</b> was set 100  nm above the light source to detect reflections. Simulated reflection spectra over {{a broad range of}} wavelengths were obtained by Fourier transform from the <b>power</b> <b>monitor.</b> Energy conversion measurements were performed under 1 -sun illumination using a four-wire connection to eliminate the effects of the lead resistance. The exposed area (16  mm 2) was defined by an opaque mask. The probes penetrated into the mask and contacted with Ag paste that was printed on the flat surface to decrease the shadowing effect from tips on the exposed region.|$|E
