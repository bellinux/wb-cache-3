60|$|Wick was scarce an {{eligible}} <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> But {{how much}} better it was to hang in the cold wind upon the pier, to go down with Bob Bain among {{the roots of the}} staging, to be all day in a boat coiling a wet rope and shouting orders - not always very wise - than to be warm and dry, and dull, and dead-alive, in the most comfortable office. And Wick itself had in those days a note of originality. It may have still, but I misdoubt it much. The old minister of Keiss would not preach, in these degenerate times, {{for an hour and a}} half upon the clock. The gipsies must be gone from their cavern; where you might see, from the mouth, the women tending their fire, like Meg Merrilies, and the men sleeping off their coarse potations; and where, in winter gales, the surf would beleaguer them closely, bursting in their very door. A traveller to-day upon the Thurso coach would scarce observe a little cloud of smoke among the moorlands, and be told, quite openly, it marked a private still. He would not indeed make that journey, for there is now no Thurso coach. And even if he could, one little thing that happened to me could never happen to him, or not with the same trenchancy of contrast.|$|E

50|$|Aalahayude Penmakkal (Daughters of God the father) is a Malayalam novel {{written by}} Sarah Joseph and {{published}} in 1999. The novel {{is the first in}} the trilogy which includes 'Mattathi' and 'Othappu'. This novel gave widespread recognition to Sarah Joseph and her craft. 'Aalahayude Penmakkal' won the Kerala Sahitya Academy award of 2001, Kendra Sahitya Academy award of 2003 and Vayalar Ramavarma award of 2004. The novel deals with the condition of marginalized groups in society pointed out as subalterns by Marxist Antonio Gramsci. The living and existential conditions of these groups are seldom acknowledged by the society at large and generally they are displaced from their <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> and livelihoods, usually in the name of development and change. This transformation in their existential struggle is narrated by Annie, the central character, who gives voice to three generations of her subaltern group albeit with a feminine perspective.|$|R

5000|$|By {{the end of}} the 12th {{century the}} divide of the country was final and new centers of power took the Kievan style and adopted it to their traditions. In the {{northern}} principality of Vladimir-Suzdal the local churches were built of white stone with help of Romanesque masters of Friedrich Barbarossa, whilst their wall statuary was elaborately carved by craftsmen from Georgia. The Suzdal style is also known as [...] "white-stone architecture" [...] ("белокаменное зодчество"). The first white-stone church was the St. Boris and Gleb Church commissioned by Yuri Dolgoruky, a church-fortress in Kideksha near Suzdal, at the supposed <b>place</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> knyazes Boris and Gleb on their pilgrimage to Kiev. The white-stone churches mark the highest point of pre-Mongolian Rus' architecture.

5000|$|While the {{campaign}} against Polish landownership largely missed its aims, it produced a strong opposition with its own hero, Drzymała. In 1904 he purchased a plot of land in Podgradowice (Kaisertreu) (today: Drzymałowo) in the Posen district of Bomst, but found that the newly implemented Prussian Feuerstättengesetz ("furnace law") enabled local officials to deny him as a Pole the permission to build a permanent dwelling with an oven on his land. The law considered any <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> a house if it stayed in one place for more than 24 hours. To get around the rule, he set himself up in a former circus caravan and for several years tenaciously defied in the courts all attempts to remove him.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} ways in which {{activism}} and resistance are incorporated into the everyday lives and practices of rural women in the Ecuadorian and Peruvian Andes, theorising the nature of women’s everyday resistance in long running social conflicts. Drawing on research with women anti-mining activists in Peru and Ecuador, the paper emphasises that their resistance is rarely concerned with large-scale protests, transnational activism, and the spectacular, but rather depends on daily resistance and resilience in, often fractured, local communities. I explore how rural women make extraordinary circumstances, including facing lawsuits and accusations of terrorism, part of their everyday lives, and how they articulate their resistance and situate it in <b>place</b> through narratives <b>of</b> <b>staying</b> put and carrying on, drawing on emblematic notions of rural livelihoods to challenge large scale mining developments in their communities...|$|R
5000|$|All {{the worlds}} except the earth {{are used as}} {{temporary}} <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> as follows: upon ones death on earth, the yamadutas(there are many supernatural entities under Lord Yama who watch over the punishment of sinners in the lower lokas) are present there {{at the moment of}} ones death and take the soul to the lower worlds if its a sinner or take it to the higher worlds [...] if it has not committed any sin,only the pure and sinless are taken to swarga or one of the utharva loks: [...]The god of death (officially called Yama Dharma Raajaa - Yama, the lord of justice) comes only for either extremely sinful people like people who killed millions or were directly involved in the killing of millions if they had that strength and authority, for it was meant to serve the right not wrong; or for people who committed no single sin throughout their life to assist them to swarga or beyond if they die desireless and served their ishta devta with worship aiming for moksha. So either yamaduts or, in rare cases, Lord Yama himself tallies the persons good/bad deeds while on earth and decides if the soul goes to a heaven and/or a hell, for how long, and in what capacity. Only a sinless person ascends to swarga or beyond if he hasnt committed any act of sin or did penance to cut out his karmic sins and cleansed himself. In either case, the soul acquires a body as appropriate to the worlds it enters. At the end of the souls time in those worlds, it returns to the earth (is reborn as a life form on the earth). It is considered that only from the earth, and only after a human life, can the soul reach supreme salvation or better said moksha: [...] (since salvation isnt a rightful equivalent of the word or no word for that matter in any other language of the world which originated out of India), the state free from the cycle of birth and death, a state of absolute and eternal bliss, a state where you merge into vishnu: [...] or say Parabrahman: [...] since Lord Vishnu is manifest form of paraBrahman himself.|$|R
