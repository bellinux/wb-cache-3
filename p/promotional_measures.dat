We then discuss the practical advantage of the DLM/MSCM modeling approach using aggregated data, and we propose two tests to determine the superiority of a particular baseline estimate: the minimization of weekly sales volatility and the existence of no correlation with promotional activities in these estimates. Finally, we test this baseline against the industry standard ones on the two measures of performance. Our tests find the DLM/MSCM baseline sales to be superior to the existing log-linear models by reducing the weekly baseline sales volatility by over 80 % and by being uncorrelated to promotional activities.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} study was to explore, and as a result, {{to better understand the}} positions of two central prostitution organisations, Pro Sentret in Norway, and Prostitutionsenheten (Prostitution Centre) in Sweden, using the method of comparative analysis. I used the following research questions: How do the legal and <b>promotional</b> prevention <b>measures</b> on prostitution in Norway and Sweden differ and what characterizes them? What is the position of central institutions on the debate on prostitution, Pro Sentret in Oslo and Prostitutionsenheten in Stockholm, on the visibility of human trafficking and the legal approach used in Sweden? I wondered, could there be a link between the positions these organisations have on prostitution, and the measures they develop to address the problem? For 25 years Pro Sentret has lobbied hard so that laws should remain unchanged, and to prevent new laws to end prostitution. They argue that they should not come at the cost of the personal freedoms of the women, and there is no proof they work, therefore only social measures should be used. In Sweden, they use both social and legal measures in combination to eliminate prostitution, as that is their primary goal. Prostitution is just another form of male violence and domination, where women are the victims who must be helped and protected, even at the expense of their individual rights and civil liberties. In the discussion both countries argue that they use measures that best protect women’s rights with the goal being equality. It is the difference in interpretation of the concept of equality that {{is at the heart of}} this longstanding ideological disagreement. There is a need for an evaluation style study to be conducted that looks more closely at the findings from this research, to determine which approach best meets the needs of women in prostitution.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the nature and magnitude of the effects of infrastructure provision on regional economic performance. The empirical evidence of our analysis is based on difference-in-difference estimation linking the changes in the growth rate of regional-level economic outcomes in affected regions to the newly built railway connection in the southern part of Uzbekistan, conditioned on the regions' time-invariant individual effects, time-varying covariates, and evolving economic characteristics. To explore the differential nature of infrastructure provision, we employ an estimation examining regional, spillover, and connectivity effects from the railway connection, as well as the anticipation, launch, and postponed effects of such a connection. Our empirical results suggest that the Tashguzar-Boysun-Kumkurgon railway line in Uzbekistan encouraged an increase of around 2 % in the regional gross domestic product growth rate in affected regions in the frame of connectivity effects. This seems to have been driven by increases in industry value added and services value added of approximately 5 % and 7 %, respectively. Positive and significant changes in the industrial output of the directly affected and neighboring regions mostly took place during the design and construction period in anticipation of the railway connection. The impact on agricultural output has been moderate in comparison to the abovementioned sectors, constituting around 1 %, which is consistent with previous literature on the differential impact of public capital. Our results and the framework provided might help regulatory bodies to conduct comprehensive estimations of the impact of infrastructure and develop the formulation of both <b>promotional</b> and compensatory <b>measures</b> related to or induced by the effects of infrastructure provision...|$|R

The statistical population of the experimental survey is made of the active accommodation facilities in Basilicata, among the almost 650 present in the regional database. From this population, a reduced sample of facilities is obtained through a complex sampling, able to represent the population properly. Stratified samplings are planned according to the areas (Matera, Potenza, Maratea, Jonian Coast, Pollino and rest of the territory), the accommodation typologies (hotels and other facilities) and to the previous year tourist traffic size (in this procedure, above or under the limit of 11. 000 presences). The survey is carried out through the ISTAT form that the facilities’ managers are obliged to provide via paper or via e-mail (often after repeated reminder).

40|$|Essay 1 {{focuses on}} {{purchasing}} {{behavior in the}} video game market, which can be conceptualized as a two-stage process where users first purchase a console and then purchase content for that console. Prior research on platform-mediated markets, which are defined by this interdependence in platform and content sales, has highlighted the relationship between installed base size (i. e. {{the total number of}} console adopters) and content sales. We extend this research by examining how two characteristics of installed bases, unrelated to size, affect content sales. First, we investigate the effect of installed base innovativeness, defined as the proportion of total adopters from early in the platform product's lifecycle, on content sales. Next, we evaluate the effect of installed base recency, defined as the proportion of total adopters that recently adopted the platform product. We find that more innovative or recently adopted installed bases purchase more content on a per user basis. These results suggest that content sales depend on more than just installed base size, providing an opportunity to increase content sales through the identification of installed bases high in either innovativeness or recency. In Essay 2, we examine how media exposures from sponsorship can impact a firm's financial performance. The extant literature has typically used aggregate expenditures as a proxy to study the financial effect of paid marketing communications. However, prior research has demonstrated that expenditures might not be an appropriate proxy for the overall effect of these marketing communications. We, therefore, study how exposures impact firm financial performance independently of firm expenditures used to obtain those exposures. Using a unique context (stadium naming rights agreements), in which the firm receives a random number of exposures, and leveraging the temporal nature of paid promotion in this context, we separately identify the effects of exposures from expenditures. In three analyses, we find that exposures increase firm stock returns and lower firm systematic risk, while promotional expenditures decrease firm stock returns and raise firm systematic risk. These results begin to bridge the gap in how <b>promotional</b> communications are <b>measured</b> between the marketing/finance interface literature and the broader literature on marketing effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Nature-based {{tourism and}} {{recreation}} {{is a growing}} phenomenon around the world. In Australia, nature-based tourism represents {{an important part of}} the tourism sector and is to a large extent dependent on protected areas such as World Heritage areas, marine parks and national parks. While tourism and recreation can benefit protected areas, some are under pressure from visitation and marketing should play a role in managing visitor demand. To this end, a number of authors have suggested demarketing as a management tool to address situations of excess visitor demand, however, research on demarketing in protected areas is limited. To address this research gap, this thesis examines the use of demarketing in Australian national parks that face excess visitor demand using a case study on the Blue Mountains National Park. The thesis investigates factors that contribute to high visitor demand for the park, the use of demarketing to manage demand and factors that influence when and how demarketing is applied. Demarketing is that aspect of marketing that deals with discouraging customers in general or a certain class of customers in particular on either a temporary or permanent basis. In protected areas specifically, demarketing is concerned with reducing visitor numbers in total or selectively and redistributing demand spatially or temporarily. Six factors that contribute to high visitor demand for the national park were identified including the attractiveness of the park, its proximity to Sydney and the fact that the park is a renowned destination with icon sites. It was established that no holistic demarketing strategy is currently employed in the park and that the demarketing measures that are applied are not consciously used as demarketing. The measures used in the Blue Mountains National Park were discussed according to their association with the marketing mix components (4 Ps). Demarketing measures related to 'product' include limiting recreational activities by defining specific areas where they can be conducted, limiting the duration of activities and closures of sites or features in the park. The measures related to 'place' are the use of a booking system, limiting visitor numbers and group sizes, commercial licensing and limiting signage. Measures related to 'price' are not extensively used in the park. The <b>promotional</b> demarketing <b>measures</b> applied include stressing restrictions and appropriate environmental behaviour in promotional material and nonpromotion of certain areas or experiences in the park. Importantly, these demarketing measures are not employed across the whole park or for all user groups, but are used for certain experiences in specific contexts and circumstances. Three types of factors influence the use of demarketing in the Blue Mountains National Park: pragmatic considerations, resource considerations and stakeholder interests. Pragmatic considerations include the feasibility and effectiveness of certain demarketing measures, which are influenced by the specific context of the national park. Resource considerations relate to financial, human and temporal resources and the findings suggest that a lack of resources influences and at times inhibits the use of demarketing measures. It was also found that various stakeholders have a profound influence on the use of demarketing measures. The stakeholder groups have diverse interests and therefore influence the use of demarketing in different ways by supporting or impeding certain measures. Based on the findings and limitations of this study, recommendations for government and future research are made. These emphasise among others the need for more consistent and comprehensive collection of visitor information to tailor management actions more effectively. It is also suggested that a more conscious and holistic application of demarketing measures may help to manage visitor demand to parks proactively to ensure that the resource remains for future generations...|$|R

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of widespread poverty and deprivation in South Asian countries points towards {{the need to}} adopt a wider concept of social security that would include both promotional and protective social security. This article advocates this view {{against the backdrop of}} the coverage and financing of existing social security programmes and points to the inadequacies of these measures in attaining the objectives of higher economic growth and the eradication of poverty. A character-istic feature of current social security programmes in South Asian economies is that they are designed in a conceptual vacuum and are implemented mainly as wel-fare measures. The emphasis is on <b>promotional</b> <b>measures</b> and even within that cat-egory, on poverty alleviation programmes. A balanced provision of promotional and protective social security measures is not evident in any country. Some esti-mates of the resource requirements for providing such balanced social security suggest that the cumulative cost of essential human investment over the period 1995 - 2010 would be over 4 - 5 per cent of GDP.

However, these {{legal provisions}} {{are not the}} only opportunities and obstacles that immigrants face on the path to citizenship. Administrative procedures are crucially important for the implementation of these legal provisions and guarantee access in practice. Based on existing literature on the implementation of naturalisation policies, the ACIT project calculated 38 ‘Implementation Indicators’ (CITIMP), which measure the formal steps of the ordinary naturalisation procedures in 35 European countries. The CITIMP results suggest that most countries’ procedures contain as many obstacles as opportunities for ordinary naturalisation with many clear patterns across Europe. <b>Promotional</b> <b>measures</b> are often missing or poor quality. Legal exemptions for documentation rarely exist on humanitarian or vulnerability grounds. Documentation from countries of origin is especially complicated for applicants. Not only are most ordinary naturalisation procedures discretionary, but so are many language, integration and economic resource requirements. Most procedures involve potentially long processing times and some amount of bureaucracy, especially when the deciding authority is the executive or legislature. Judicial review is often not guaranteed for language or integration requirements or on specific issues such as discrimination within the procedure. Moreover, this paper finds that European countries that facilitate their ordinary naturalisation law do not necessarily facilitate the procedure. Whatever the interpretation of the meaning of these results, the descriptive analysis confirms the importance of measuring administrative practices...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This {{thesis is}} an attempt to {{investigate}} how the use of promotional activities can help to develop the tourism industry by giving a special concentration to the case of Bangladesh. The investigation was conducted from both a theoretical and an empirical point of view. The contribution of the same industry to the world economy is considerable. Many countries are now dependent on this sector for foreign currency earnings. Every destination country is trying to achieve more gain by developing this industry. The expansion of the tourism through out the world has increased competition among the tourist destinations, trying to attract more tourists by adopting appropriate marketing techniques and strategies. Failure of doing so by a particular marketer will lead to a less competitive in the world tourism market. As an important element of marketing mix, promotion plays the vital role in marketing any product and service. Tourism product/service is of no exception. Because of the tourists want to know in advance about the attractions and the facilities of a particular destination. The tourist also wants to know other related information of his/her visit to make the same safe, secured and enjoyable.
