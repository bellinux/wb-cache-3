40|$|Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} forms of human malignancy, but, other than TP 53 mutations, few causative somatic aberrations have been identified. We identified NOTCH 1 or NOTCH 2 mutations in ∼ 75 % of cutaneous SCCs and in a lesser fraction of lung SCCs, defining a spectrum for the most prevalent tumor suppressor specific to these epithelial malignancies. Notch receptors normally transduce signals in response to ligands on neighboring cells, regulating metazoan lineage selection and developmental patterning. Our findings therefore illustrate a central role for disruption of microenvironmental communication in cancer <b>progression.</b> <b>NOTCH</b> aberrations include frameshift and nonsense mutations leading to receptor truncations as well as point substitutions in key functional domains that abrogate signaling in cell-based assays. Oncogenic gain-of-function mutations in NOTCH 1 commonly occur in human T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The bifunctional role of Notch in human cancer thus emphasizes the context dependency of signaling outcomes and suggests that targeted inhibition of the Notch pathway may induce squamous epithelial malignancies...|$|R
40|$|The {{durability}} and damage tolerance of laminated composites are critical design considerations for airframe composite structures. Therefore, {{the ability to}} model damage initiation and growth and predict the life of laminated composites is necessary to achieve structurally efficient and economical designs. The purpose {{of this research is}} to experimentally verify the application of a continuum damage model to predict progressive damage development in a toughened material system. Damage due to monotonic and tension-tension fatigue was documented for IM 7 / 5260 graphite/bismaleimide laminates. Crack density and delamination surface area were used to calculate matrix cracking and delamination internal state variables to predict stiffness loss in unnotched laminates. A damage dependent finite element code predicted the stiffness loss for notched laminates with good agreement to experimental data. It was concluded that the continuum damage model can adequately predict matrix damage <b>progression</b> in <b>notched</b> and unnotched laminates as a function of loading history and laminate stacking sequence...|$|R
40|$|In this work, two intralaminar damage {{models with}} {{different}} underlying assumptions are utilized {{to predict the}} damage response of notched composite laminates. One is a sub-laminate based continuum damage model, CODAM 2, implemented in LS-DYNA, {{and the other is}} a ply-based damage model, ABQ_DLR_UD, that uses the Ladevèze damage model as its basis and is implemented as a user-material model (VUMAT) in Abaqus/Explicit. Aside from the base-formulations, different variations of the models including local and nonlocal integration (smearing) schemes are also considered. These models are employed to predict the damage response of Over-height compact tension (OCT) and scaled center-notched specimens made out of IM 7 / 8552 CFRP laminates with quasi-isotropic layup. For each geometry and loading scenario, sensitivity of the predictions with respect to various damage parameters including peak stress and fracture energy as well as assumptions made on the shape of the strain-softening curve are investigated. The results shed light on the effect of various assumptions in these models on predicting damage <b>progression</b> in <b>notched</b> specimens...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a finite element modelling methodology {{to predict the}} initiation and damage <b>progression</b> in <b>notched</b> composite laminated plates subjected to increasing in-plane tension load. An important feature of the methodology is it does not rely on customized user-subroutines but solely on the analysis capabilities of the general purpose software Abaqus; thus ensuring that the numerical results can be universally reproduced. The methodology presented copes with intralaminar failure modes and uses the Hashin failure criterion to predict the onset of failure (cracking). To account for damage progression after crack initiation there is a fracture energy calculated for each of four failure modes. Four open-hole laminated plates taken from the literature are used for benchmark examples. The predicted ultimate strength based on the analytically-obtained stress-displacement curve {{was found to be}} within 10 % of the experimental observations. To study the influence of the interaction of having two or three holes across the mid-plane of a pultruded open-hole tension specimen, a parametric study was carried out. The paper ends giving guidelines for the generalized modelling methodology using Abaqus without user-subroutines...|$|R
40|$|We dissect the {{transcriptional}} regulatory relationships {{coordinating the}} dynamic expression patterns of two signaling genes, wnt 8 and delta, which {{are central to}} specification of the sea urchin embryo endomesoderm. cis-Regulatory analysis shows that transcription of the gene encoding the Notch ligand Delta is activated by the widely expressed Runx transcription factor, but spatially restricted by HesC-mediated repression through a site in the delta 5 ′UTR. Spatial transcription of the hesC gene, however, is controlled by Blimp 1 repression. Blimp 1 thus represses the repressor of delta, thereby permitting its transcription. The blimp 1 gene is itself linked into a feedback circuit that includes the wnt 8 signaling ligand gene, and we showed earlier that this circuit generates an expanding torus of blimp 1 and wnt 8 expression. The finding that delta expression is also controlled at the cis-regulatory level by the blimp 1 -wnt 8 torus-generating subcircuit now explains the <b>progression</b> of <b>Notch</b> signaling from the mesoderm to the endoderm of the developing embryo. Thus the specific cis-regulatory linkages of the gene regulatory network encode the coordinated spatial expression of Wnt and Notch signaling as they sweep outward across the vegetal plate of the embryo...|$|R
40|$|Results of an {{experimental}} and analytical evaluation of damage progression in three stitched composite plates containing an angled central notch {{and subjected to}} compression loading are presented. Parametric studies were conducted systematically to identify the relative effects of the material strength parameters on damage initiation and growth. Comparisons with experiments were conducted to determine the appropriate in situ values of strengths for progressive failure analysis. These parametric studies indicated that the in situ value of the fiber buckling strength {{is the most important}} parameter in the prediction of damage initiation and growth in these notched composite plates. Analyses of the damage <b>progression</b> in the <b>notched,</b> compression-loaded plates were conducted using in situ material strengths. Comparisons of results obtained from these analyses with experimental results for displacements and axial strains show good agreement...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{regulation}} and function of the Notch 1 gene in negative control of human tumors. Here we show that Notch 1 gene expression and activity are substantially down-modulated in keratinocyte cancer cell lines and tumors, with expression of this gene being under p 53 control in these cells. Genetic suppression of Notch signaling in primary human keratinocytes is sufficient, together with activated ras, to cause aggressive squamous cell carcinoma formation. Similar tumor-promoting effects are also caused by in vivo treatment of mice, grafted with keratinocytes expressing oncogenic ras alone, with a pharmacological inhibitor of endogenous Notch signaling. These effects are linked with a lesser commitment of keratinocytes to differentiation, an expansion of stem cell populations, and a mechanism involving up-regulation of ROCK 1 / 2 and MRCKalpha kinases, two key effectors of small Rho GTPases previously implicated in neoplastic <b>progression.</b> Thus, the <b>Notch</b> 1 gene is a p 53 target with a role in human tumor suppression through negative regulation of Rho effectors...|$|R
40|$|Pancreatic ductal {{adenocarcinoma}} (PDAC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} aggressive human cancers, with a five-year survival rate of less than 4 %. The most commonly mutated oncogene in PDAC is K-ras. Mouse models have demonstrated that expression of activated K-ras in the pancreas is sufficient to recapitulate the entire spectrum of human disease, from premalignant lesions to the development of invasive adenocarcinoma. The Notch proteins are central components of pancreatic development. Recent studies suggest Notch signaling is reactivated during PDAC initiation and progression, leading to the supposition that Notch promotes PDAC, and therefore may represent a target for drug development. To assess whether Notch 1 is required for K-ras-induced PDAC, we employed a mouse model in which oncogenic K-ras is activated and Notch 1 is deleted simultaneously in the pancreas. Surprisingly, loss of Notch 1 in the presence of activated K-ras led to increased tumor incidence and <b>progression,</b> implying <b>Notch</b> 1 functions as a tumor suppressor in PDAC. To identify the mechanism underlying the accelerated tumor development, we investigated the role of Notch 1 in acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM), a precursor to the development of PDAC. Using both an in vivo mouse model and an in vitro explant culture system, we found that loss of Notch 1 had no effect on ADM, suggesting Notch 1 signaling regulates alternative molecular events in PDAC development. Overall these findings indicate Notch 1 functions to inhibit pancreatic tumor development, and suggest that therapeutically targeting the Notch pathway may be detrimental to PDAC patients. ...|$|R
40|$|Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) has a poor {{prognosis}} due to widespread intrahepatic spread. Aspartate β-hydroxylase (ASPH) is a transmembrane protein and catalyzes the hydroxylation of aspartyl and asparaginyl residues in calcium binding {{epidermal growth factor}} (cbEGF) -like domains of various proteins, including Notch receptors and ligands. ASPH is highly overexpressed (> 95 %) in human CCA tumors. We explored the molecular mechanisms by which ASPH mediated the CCA malignant phenotype and evaluated the potential of ASPH as a therapeutic target for CCA. The importance of expression and enzymatic activity of ASPH for CCA growth and progression was examined using shRNA "knockdown" and a mutant construct that reduced its catalytic activity. Second generation small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) of β-hydroxylase activity were developed and used to target ASPH in vitro and in vivo. Subcutaneous and intrahepatic xenograft rodent models were employed to determine anti-tumor effects on CCA growth and development. It {{was found that the}} enzymatic activity of ASPH was critical for mediating CCA progression, as well as inhibiting apoptosis. Mechanistically, ASPH overexpression promoted Notch activation and modulated CCA <b>progression</b> through a <b>Notch</b> 1 -dependent cyclin D 1 pathway. Targeting ASPH with shRNAs or a SMI significantly suppressed CCA growth in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Destructive and {{nondestructive}} {{examinations of}} composite laminates subjected to exter-nal loading {{have indicated that}} these materials contain {{a large number of}} cracks, both on the micro- and macro-scales. Consequently, a significant amount of emission can be generated during fatigue loading not only by damage accumulation (progression) but also by the continuous friction that results from the fracture surfaces grating against each other. Consequently, in order to monitor fatigue damage progression in composite laminates by acoustic emission (AE), the emission caused by the fretting should be distinguished from that generated by actual damage growth. In this study, AE was monitored during fatigue loading in a variety of cross-ply graphite/epoxy laminates. The specimens were subjected to tension-tension (R = 0. 1) cyclic loading. Emphasis was placed on distinguishing the emission caused by new damage from friction generated emission by identifying the characteristic intensities asso-ciated with friction. It has been determined that the event intensities (i. e., duration, energy, and counts per event) associated with friction are all below given threshold values. Based on these results, damage progression curves could be established. A case study is presented in which the data analysis methodology developed in this study has been suc-cessfully utilized to monitor damage <b>progression</b> in a <b>notched</b> laminate during quasi-static and fatigue loading...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Pancreatic {{cancer is}} one of the deadliest human malignancies, with few {{therapeutic}} options. Re-activation of embryonic signaling pathways is commonly in human pancreatic cancer and provided rationale to explore inhibition of these pathways therapeutically. Notch signaling is important during pancreatic development, and it is re-activated in pancreatic cancer. The functional role of Notch signaling during pancreatic carcinogenesis has been previously characterized using both genetic and drug-based approaches. However, contrasting findings were reported based on the study design. In fact, Notch signaling has been proposed to act as tumor-promoter or tumor-suppressor. Given the availability of Notch inhibitors in the clinic, understanding how this signaling pathway contributes to pancreatic carcinogenesis has important therapeutic implications. Here, we interrogated the role of Notch signaling specifically in the epithelial compartment of the pancreas, {{in the context of a}} genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer. Methods To inhibit Notch signaling in the pancreas epithelium, we crossed a mouse model of pancreatic cancer based on pancreas-specific expression of mutant Kras with a transgenic mouse that conditionally expresses a dominant negative form of the Mastermind-like 1 gene. MAML is an essential co-activator of the canonical Notch signaling-mediated transcription. DNMAML encodes a truncated MAML protein that represses all canonical Notch mediated transcription in a cell autonomous manner, independent of which Notch receptor is activated. As a result, in mice co-expressing mutant Kras and DNMAML, Notch signaling is inhibited specifically in the epithelium upon Cre-mediated recombination. We explored the effect of epithelial-specific DNMAML expression on Kras-driven carcinogenesis both during normal aging and following the induction of acute pancreatitis. Results We find that DNMAML expression efficiently inhibits epithelial Notch signaling and delays PanIN formation. However, over time, loss of Notch inhibition allows PanIN formation and <b>progression.</b> Conclusions Epithelial-specific <b>Notch</b> signaling is important for PanIN initiation. Our findings indicate that PanIN formation can only occur upon loss of epithelial Notch inhibition, thus supporting an essential role of this signaling pathway during pancreatic carcinogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Fetal alcohol {{spectrum}} disorder (FASD) is {{a result}} of prenatal alcohol exposure, producing a wide range of defects including craniofacial, sensory, motor and cognitive deficits. Many ocular abnormalities are frequently associated with FASD including microphthalmia, optic nerve hypoplasia, and cataracts. FASD is highly prevalent in low socioeconomic populations, where it is also accompanied by higher rates of malnutrition and alcoholism. Using zebrafish as a model to study FASD retinal defects has been extremely insightful in understanding the ethanol-induced retinal defects at the cellular level. Zebrafish embryos treated with ethanol from mid-blastula transition through somitogenesis (2 - 24 hours post fertilization; hpf) showed defects similar to human ocular deficits including microphthalmia, optic nerve hypoplasia, and photoreceptor differentiation defects. Ethanol exposure altered critical transcription factor expression involved in retinal cell differentiation. Retinoic acid (RA) and folic acid (FA) nutrient co-supplementation rescued optic nerve and photoreceptor differentiation defects. Ethanol exposure during retinal morphogenesis stages (16 - 24 hpf), produced retinal defects like those seen with ethanol exposure between 2 - 24 hpf. Significantly, during ethanol-sensitive time window (16 - 24 hpf), RA co-supplementation moderately rescued these defects, whereas, FA cosupplementation showed significant rescue of optic nerve and photoreceptor differentiation. RA, but not FA, supplementation after ethanol exposure could restore ethanol-induced optic nerve and photoreceptor differentiation defects. Ethanol exposure did not affect timing of retinal cell differentiation induction, but later increased retinal cell death and proliferation. Ethanol-treated embryos showed increased retinal proliferation in the outer nuclear layer (ONL), inner nuclear layer (INL), and ciliary marginal zone (CMZ) at 48 hpf and 72 hpf. In order to identify the genesis of ethanol-induced persistent retinal defects, ethanol effects on retinal stem cell populations in the CMZ and the Müller glial cells (MGCs) were examined. Ethanol treated retinas had an expanded CMZ indicated by histology and Alcama, a retinal stem cell marker, immunolabeling, but reduced expression of rx 1 and the cell cycle exit marker, cdkn 1 c. Ethanol treated retinas also showed reduced MGCs. At 72 hpf, ONL of ethanol exposed fish showed fewer photoreceptors expressing terminal differentiation markers. Importantly, these poorly differentiated photoreceptors co-expressed the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proneural differentiation factor, neurod, indicating that ethanol exposure produced immature and undifferentiated photoreceptors. Reduced differentiation along with increased progenitor marker expression and proliferation suggest cell cycle exit failure due to ethanol exposure. These results suggested that ethanol exposure disrupted stem cell differentiation <b>progression.</b> Wnt, <b>Notch</b> and proneural gene expression regulate retinal stem cell proliferation and transition into progenitor cells. Ethanol exposure disrupted Wnt activity in the CMZ as well as Notch activity and neurod gene expression in the retina. RA and FA co-supplementation were able to rescue Wnt activity in the CMZ and rescue downstream Notch activity. To test whether the rescue of these Wnt-active cells could restore the retinal cell differentiation pathways, ethanol treated embryos were treated with Wnt agonist. This treatment could restore Wnt-active cells in the CMZ, Notch-active cells in the retina, proliferation, and photoreceptor terminal differentiation. We conclude that ethanol exposure produced persistent defects in the stem cell Wnt signaling, a critical pathway in retinal cell differentiation. Further analysis of underlying molecular mechanisms will provide insight into the embryonic origins of ethanol-induced retinal defects and potential therapeutic targets to cure this disorder...|$|R
