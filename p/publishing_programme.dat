It published its first volume in 1884, and has now published all the rolls from 1158 to 1224. Besides the continuous series, it has also published the roll for 1230. The Pipe rolls for 1241 were published in 1918 by the Yale University Press. Various county record societies have published parts of the rolls for various years that relate to their particular county. The Pipe Roll Society's earliest volumes (to 1900) were printed in [...] "record type", designed to produce a near-facsimile of the original manuscript, including its scribal abbreviations. This policy was abandoned in 1903, and all volumes since {{have been published in}} normal type with abbreviations extended.|$|E

The answer to such a question might seem obvious to a book collector or a book historian, but to a commercial business, operating {{in the present and}} planning <b>publishing</b> <b>programmes</b> for the next few years, the answer is not so evident. "Our job", said Simon Winder, Publishing Director at Penguin Press at the " 75 years of Penguin Books" conference at the University of Bristol, "is to be optimistic about the future". Thus, the initial question about why {{a publishing}} company might be interested in its past leads to another: for a commercial business, what is the value of their history...|$|R

Our findings suggest that 1) a considerable part of the effect of educational mismatches can be attributed to skills heterogeneity, and 2) that the extent to which skills explain educational mismatches varies by institutional contexts. These observations suggest that skills matter for explaining wage effects of education and educational mismatches, but the extent to which this is the case also depends on institutional contexts...|$|R

These were his First Symphony, Violin Concerto, and Second Symphony, which all play for between forty-five minutes and an hour. McVeagh says of the symphonies that they [...] "rank high not only in Elgar's output but in English musical history. Both are long and powerful, without <b>published</b> <b>programmes,</b> only hints and quotations to indicate some inward drama from which they derive their vitality and eloquence. Both are based on classical form but differ from it to the extent that ... they were considered prolix and slackly constructed by some critics. Certainly the invention in them is copious; each symphony would need several dozen music examples to chart its progress." ...|$|R
