40|$|Three test {{instruments}} are being evaluated {{to determine the}} feasibility of using photoacoustic technology for measuring unburned carbon in fly ash. The first test instrument is a single microwave frequency system previously constructed to measure photo-acoustic signals in an off-line configuration. This system was assembled and used to test parameters thought important to photo-acoustic signal output. A standard modulation frequency was chosen based upon signal to noise data gained from experimentation. Testing in the sixth quarter focused on initial testing for a magnetic photo-acoustic effect, loss tests and photo-acoustic tests on coal samples, and extending the testing range for the photo-acoustic effect over the octave of 900 MHz to 1800 MHz. Previous testing on this project was done at 1 GHz. In parallel with the <b>photo-acoustic</b> <b>testing,</b> some preliminary design considerations were investigated for the on-line monitor to be fabricated and testing in phase three of this project...|$|E

A standard modulation frequency was chosen based upon signal to noise data gained from experimentation. Sample heterogeneity was tested and found not to be influential. Further testing showed that sample compression and photo-acoustic volume do affect <b>photo-acoustic</b> signal. <b>Testing</b> {{in the fourth quarter}} focused on signal repeatability, linearity, the effects of ultrasonic shaking, and sample cup variations. Simultaneously, a second instrument is being constructed based in part on lessons learned with the first instrument, but also expands the capabilities of the first instrument. The power amplifiers for this second instrument were recently completed and tested. Improvements were made to the current leveling loop, which will stabilize the microwave power. Other efforts were spent generating a magnetic field or electric field source for the photo-acoustic effect. The intent of this effort {{is to be able to}} discriminate between magnetic contaminants such as iron and non-magnetic contaminants such as carbon. A short coaxial test fixture was fabricated and tested showing the promise of another microwave based test method for determining carbon content in fly ash. The third instrument will be designed based on the experiences of the first two instruments and will operate in an on-line carbon-in-ash monitoring system for coal-fired power plants...|$|R

Many <b>tests</b> were performed in the third quarter, which included the effects of ambient temperature and humidity, as well as sample moisture content, and signal linearity. Conclusions regarding the data for sample bulk density and temperature are pending further review and may require further testing. Simultaneously, a second instrument is being constructed {{based in part on}} lessons learned with the first instrument, but which also expands the capabilities of the first instrument. Improvements include a control loop to allow more constant microwave power output and an ability to operate over a range of microwave frequencies. To date, all of the components for the second instrument have been received and most of them tested {{with the exception of the}} broadband impedance transformers, as they will be incorporated into the second instrument test chamber. The third instrument will be designed based on the experiences of the first two instruments and will operate in an on-line carbon-in-ash monitoring system for coal-fired power plants...|$|R
