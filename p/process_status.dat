Pricing Engine allows to set pricing for customer classes, product groups, individual products, or customers, quantity breaks. Customers can have different price classes based on volume, and/or location. Price can be set for future effective dates. Authorization Keys give flexibility with user access and security in similar way as Access Control Matrix. Warehouse in <b>Process</b> <b>Status</b> Queue shows what orders to pick for customers, what transfers to receive from other branches, or purchase orders to receive from vendors. Real-time Data and Business Summary displays the income statement and balance sheet. Sales Order Management allows to receive payment from customers at the counter or over the phone. Mass Load is used to update information in the database. Third-party integration extend the functionality of the base product. Navigation menus are customized for unique users or whole departments. Accounting and Financial Management includes Receivables, Payables, Cash register. Inventory Management show inventory levels, precise product locations, history, ranking, and demand. Purchasing and Transfers are suggested by the system based on previous history and future demand.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA static multivariate {{statistical}} {{process control}} model based on principal component analysis (PCA-MSPC) was developed for an anaerobic reactor maintained in steady-state, joining the biogas composition (CH 4, CO 2, H 2) to the total solids (TS), volatile solids (VS), total inorganic carbon (TIC) and total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) contents of the slurry. The principal component analysis (PCA) highlighted a lack of correlation between the individual process variables (IPVs) measured in the slurry and the gas phase. The application of this model to the data set collected for an independent anaerobic reactor (fed with the same substrate) progressively led from steady-state to critical volatile fatty acids (VFA) intoxication did not allow evaluating its <b>process</b> <b>status.</b> A second static PCA-MSPC model was built for the steady-state reactor in excluding the TS and VS content of the slurry and was successfully transferred to the overfed reactor. The TA² and SPE control charts built for the overfed reactor using this second model closely reflected its <b>process</b> <b>status</b> and delivered valuable warning signals approaching the VFA intoxication. The gas phase composition (CH 4, CO 2, H 2) brought the main contribution to these warnings...|$|E
