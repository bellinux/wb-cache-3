Strategic thinking was established and has been used extensively in developed countries. However, strategic thinking in developing countries has received little attention. The research described in this thesis is an attempt to assess the extent of knowledge of and familiarity with the concept and <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> strategic <b>thinking,</b> as well as to assess the extent of practice <b>of</b> strategic <b>thinking</b> factors in Jordanian publicly quoted companies. Also, this research explores the barriers which prevent the practice <b>of</b> strategic <b>thinking</b> in these companies. Data was collected by using both quantitative and qualitative methods (i. e. questionnaires and interviews) which were employed at three different levels of company structures. The questionnaires aimed to investigate knowledge of and familiarity with the concept and <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> strategic <b>thinking,</b> the extent <b>of</b> strategic <b>thinking</b> practices, and the barriers which prevent the practice <b>of</b> strategic <b>thinking</b> in Jordanian publicly quoted companies. 336 questionnaires were collected from 112 Jordanian publicly quoted companies, followed by eight semi-structured interviews with eight of the companies to support the study objectives and to achieve a good understanding <b>of</b> strategic <b>thinking</b> practices in Jordanian companies. The main findings of this research are that the surveyed companies in Jordan have good knowledge of and are familiar with the concept of strategic thinking; that the age of a company has a moderate relationship with knowledge of the concept and <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> strategic <b>thinking,</b> while the size of a company has no relationship with knowledge of the concept and <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> strategic thinking; and that few differences exist between the four business sectors concerning the contribution to knowledge of and familiarity with the concept and <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> strategic <b>thinking.</b> The majority <b>of</b> surveyed companies in Jordan use strategic thinking skills extensively in their companies. The findings also show that Jordanian publicly quoted companies face different barriers which prevent the practice <b>of</b> strategic <b>thinking</b> in their companies.

As this paper examines creativity and logic among these students, it is necessary to acknowledge the difference between Western and Chinese logical systems. Nisbett points out that Aristotle's syllogism would have been antithetical to Chinese thinkers, for whom the interconnectedness of all things was paramount. 1 Western, Aristotelian, logical analysis decontextualizes and disconnects discreet bits of meaning from the surrounding field in an incessant search for contradictions. This principal of non-contradiction is a foundation of Western propositional logic. Syllogisms, an example of Western and Aristotelian logic, are still much in use. Along with their derivative enthymemes, syllogisms were a part of every Western college writing class I took or taught. A syllogism, however, can be true or false. Syllogisms decontextualize meaning. This may be both useful and rational, but it is not reasonable, in the comfortable, everyday sense of the word.

It is this issue, the mother as link to child and the nature of the father 2 ̆ 7 s relationships with the mother that I make the center of my remarks. There are several things to keep in mind when we try to grasp the evolutionary big picture and to make sense of men in human families as we now find them in postindustrial western society. We humans of 2 ̆ 7 today carry with us the effects of selection in past environments. These effects are evident in our physical and behavioral makeup. Although we cannot know in detail the past physical and social environments in which our ancestors evolved, we can make various informed guesses, based on an understanding of how morphological, behavioral, and life-history features act together in other species. The ethnographic and historicall literature provide data of another type, allowing us to see men playing various domestic and paternal roles. In these different settings, however, the concrete form of social institutions can vary so widely that a unitary picture of men in families does not emerge.

To the contrary, Dwyer, et al (1988) claim the Heidegger’s philosophy, 2 ̆ 2 clearly suggests an educational theory 2 ̆ 2 (p. 100). This, is perhaps an overly optimistic claim, for it glosses over the difficulty associated with plumbing the depths of Heidegger’s vast corpus in order to speculate on the legitimate potential his philosophy has for contemporary educational practices. It is possible, I suggest, to find meaning in Heidegger’s text {{as it relates to}} curriculum study, most specifically in the direction of conceiving educational practices that inspire lucid and legitimate thinking on our ontological potential as humans, which includes our unique possibilities as individuals understood in relation to our solicitous interpersonal relations with others with whom we share the world: Our Being-in-the-world in terms of Being-with-others. This paper falls into three divisions, and unfolds in the attempt to: (1) understand what an authentic existence from an ontological perspective entails; (2) explicate the detrimental effects of das Gestell, or the Enframed 2 ̆ 2 attunement 2 ̆ 2 of modern technology, on our current educational practices and our ontological 2 ̆ 2 potentiality-for-Being 2 ̆ 2; and (3) analyze literature and English teaching, forms of ontological education (inquiry), as potential means by which to overcome the negative effects of this 2 ̆ 2 technological 2 ̆ 2 trend in contemporary education through understanding what Heidegger wrote about the grounding poietic attunement of art.

Lo {{anterior}} en la medida que esta forma de producción artística implica un nuevo autoconocimiento del cuerpo femenino y una creación divergente de las estructuras identitarias que dictan cómo debe ser una mujer.

All of this with the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> in a different way the artistic production, which is not aimed by the creation of beautiful art pieces (classical concept), but in a way of conceiving the feminist art from a position situated far from the canons of the patriarchal vision of aesthetics. After then, the nodal point of this text focuses on the death of art, which leads to think about processes of an alternative subjectivity than one which is designed by dominant categories of the logos. So, this work above involves a new self-awareness of the female body and a divergent creation of identity structures in a way to take in a highest value this form of artistic production that questions how a woman should be. A reconstruction of the body where there is not myself, but an effacement to my identity, a dance of masks in which the powers from the false make their appearance as a desterritorialization of well established subjectivities. An aesthetic based over organs dismembered, or an artistic creation viewed as an abortion of the physics, which emphasizes the political and the experimental body, this one is seen as a battleground.  Keywords: false's power, body, subjectivity, stamping out, feminist art. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the core {{similarities}} and differences in conceptualizing critical <b>thinking.</b> The framework <b>of</b> analysis refers to conceptions <b>of</b> leading critical <b>thinking</b> theorists: Ennis, Siegel, Paul, McPeck and Lipman. Two key questions are in the focus of consideration: which are the defining characteristics <b>of</b> critical <b>thinking,</b> distinguishing it from other types <b>of</b> <b>thinking,</b> and what are its constituents. The nature of identified differences has lead to a dilemma whether critical thinking skills are generalized or domain specific, {{as well as to}} the question regarding the role <b>of</b> noncognitive critical <b>thinking</b> dispositions. We also discuss the relation between the dominant approach founded in informal logic and epistemological conceptions that expanded the meaning <b>of</b> critical <b>thinking</b> by elaborating its reflective, dialectical and dialogical dimensions. The prevailing view that emphasizes the pragmatic <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> critical <b>thinking</b> is contrasted with the competing Endeavour to base and justify its purpose in the concept of emancipatory rationality. The analysis outcomes suggest that, in spite of the lack of a consistent theoretical framework, competing conceptions do share some core principles, especially with respect to the distinctive features <b>of</b> critical <b>thinking.</b> However, there are deep and intrinsic differences regarding the nature <b>of</b> critical <b>thinking</b> standards and constituents, which can probably be attributed to complex and multidiscoursive nature of the concept itself. ...|$|R

It is hard to imagine a leader today, especially those who are involved in solving security issues, who does not think critically, or at least uses the concept in making decisions. Critical thinking leads to a greater certainty and confidence in an uncertain future. This skill helps us to simplify complex scenarios and brings clarity to the ambiguous situations. In essence, critical thinking is about learning how to think and how to judge and improve the quality <b>of</b> <b>thinking.</b> In the elaboration, we start with the definition <b>of</b> critical <b>thinking</b> and its philosophy, and we consider the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the <b>thinking</b> and components <b>of</b> critical <b>thinking</b> with brief definitions of each of the categories in the elements of reasoning. Further, we consider the uses <b>of</b> critical <b>thinking</b> in the decision making process. Critical thinking is useful only in those situations where human beings need to solve problems, make decisions, or decide in a reasonable and reflective way what to believe or what to do. At the end, we discuss about the use of scientific methods in the security problem solving process, and we propose a model in which scientific methods are implemented on the base of operational researches, statistical analyses, mathematical and computer modeling, simulations, analytical reasoning, and common sense. This model can be implemented in the process of understanding and improvement of the conduction of some security operations...|$|R

40|$|Starting {{with the}} fact that school {{education}} has failed to become education for critical thinking and {{that one of the reasons}} for that could be in how education for critical thinking is conceptualised, this paper presents: (1) an analysis of the predominant approach to education for critical thinking through the implementation of special programs and methods, and (2) an attempt to establish different approaches to education for critical thinking. The overview and analysis of understanding education for developing critical thinking as the implementation of special programs reveal that it is perceived as a decontextualised activity, reduced to practicing individual intellectual skills. Foundations for a different approach, which could be characterised as the ‘education for critical competencies’, are found in ideas of critical pedagogy and open curriculum theory. This approach differs from the predominant approach in terms of how the nature and <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> critical <b>thinking</b> and education for critical thinking are understood. In the approach of education for critical competencies, it is not sufficient to introduce special programs and methods for the development <b>of</b> critical <b>thinking</b> to the existing educational system. This approach emphasises the need to question and reconstruct the status, role, and power of pupils and teachers in the teaching process, but also in the process of curriculum development.

40|$|The {{following}} paper explores {{two main}} concepts: a) the ethnography as a thick and qualitative observation method, {{which refers to}} an active interpretation of the traditional ethnography by the communication design research mindset; b) the definition of design knowledge space, as extended boundaries for the physical place of design activities. In the paper we introduce the interpretation of ethnographic plan {{as a tool for}} communication epistemology and as a relevant research tool for the understanding and interaction with high complexity knowledge contexts. Ethnography has been practiced within design organizations aiming to provide remarks and insights about knowledge management systems within knowledge intensive organizations. We describe ethnography structure, tools, data analysis and interpretation techniques. For communication design practice, the field research is not considered merely as a techniques toolbox that have been borrowed from social sciences; design rhetoric refers to the major <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> design <b>thinking</b> to act transformations in the observed contexts; ethnography is a way to face problem setting through research tools that consider observation and dialogue as the necessary design premise...|$|R
