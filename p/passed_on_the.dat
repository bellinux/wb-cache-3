5|$|The Czech revolutionary {{network in}} Europe {{also had a}} role in the {{uncovering}} of Bagha Jatin's plans. The network was in touch with the members in the United States, and may have also been aware of and involved in the uncovering of the earlier plots. The American network, headed by E. V. Voska, was a counter-espionage network of nearly 80 members who, as Habsburg subjects, were presumed to be German supporters but were involved in spying on German and Austrian diplomats. Voska had begun working with Guy Gaunt, who headed Courtenay Bennett's intelligence network, at the outbreak of the war and on learning of the plot from the Czech European network, <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> information to Gaunt and to Tomáš Masaryk who further <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> information the American authorities.|$|E

5|$|By April 2015, Marvel was {{developing}} a spin-off series of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. The series, which was {{being developed by}} Bell and writer Paul Zbyszewski, {{would be based on}} storylines occurring {{at the end of the}} second season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and would receive its own pilot rather than a backdoor pilot. Though Palicki and Blood were reportedly in final discussions to headline the potential new series, ABC <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> project by May 7, 2015, when they announced their series renewals and cancellations, and new series pickups.|$|E

The character of Sir Lawrence Wildman, meanwhile, was modeled on the prominent British financier and corporate raider Sir James Goldsmith. Originally, the studio wanted Warren Beatty to play Gekko, but he was not interested; Stone, meanwhile, wanted Richard Gere, but Gere <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> role.|$|E

5|$|Waters pitched Tipping the Velvet to ten British publishers, {{but after}} they all {{rejected}} it, she began considering American publishing houses.

5|$|While racing opponents, {{the player}} must {{successfully}} manoeuvre the Jet Ski around various buoys. There {{are two types}} of buoys: red colored, which must be <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right side, and yellow buoys, which must be <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left side. Each time a buoy is correctly passed, a power arrow in the game's HUD will light, allowing the player's Jet Ski to gain speed. Up to five power arrows can be lit in order to obtain maximum power. Therefore, maintaining this process will allow the player to maintain a high speed. Failure to correctly pass a single buoy will result in the loss of all the player's accumulated power (though the power arrows can be lit again one by one) and missing five buoys {{over the course of a}} race will result in disqualification. Leaving the course area limited by pink buoys for more than five seconds will also result in disqualification.|$|E

5|$|William was {{promptly}} excommunicated and Henry {{moved quickly to}} suppress the revolt. The barons in the north were ordered to besiege William's castles, including Skipsea, and William shortly surrendered himself to the King and was ultimately pardoned. Following the rebellion, Henry ordered Skipsea Castle to be destroyed, although it is uncertain to what extent this order was actually carried out. William <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> castle to his own son, another William, but {{on the death of}} his son's widow, Isabella, it passed to the Crown in 1293.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2010, Rosenberg {{had been}} {{developing}} a Jessica Jones TV series for ABC, {{which would be}} based on Alias comic book series by Brian Michael Bendis. However, later in 2012, it was revealed that ABC had <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> series. In October 2013, following a deal made by Netflix and Marvel, the series was revived as a part of four series and one mini-series commitment in which Rosenberg was brought on to be the showrunner. In December 2014, the series had cast Krysten Ritter as Jones and revealed the official title of the series as Marvel's A.K.A. Jessica Jones. In June 2015, Marvel revealed that the title for the series would be shortened to Marvel's Jessica Jones.|$|E
5|$|Braham {{writes that}} several appeals {{were made to}} Horthy, {{including}} by the Swiss government, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Gustaf V of Sweden and, on 25 June, Pope Pius XII, possibly after Martilotti <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> report. On 26 June Richard Lichtheim of the Jewish Agency in Geneva sent a telegram to England calling on the Allies to hold members of the Hungarian government personally responsible for the killings. The cable was intercepted by the Hungarian government and shown to Prime Minister Döme Sztójay, who passed it to Horthy. Horthy ordered {{an end to the}} deportations on 7 July and they stopped two days later.|$|E

5|$|During {{the offseason}} that followed, the new Red Sox {{ownership}} (led by John W. Henry) and management tried to rid themselves of Ramirez's massive contract, despite his {{high level of}} production to date. Believed to be necessary {{in pursuit of a}} trade for Texas Rangers shortstop Alex Rodriguez, the team put Ramirez on irrevocable waivers, thus making him available to any team willing to assume the remainder of his contract. However, all 29 other teams <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to claim Ramirez due to the high cost, and Rodriguez was acquired by the Yankees instead, rather ironically as a replacement for Boone after the latter had blown out his knee playing offseason basketball.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood favors jazz (especially bebop), blues, classic {{rhythm and}} blues, classical, and country-and-western music; his {{favorite}} musicians include saxophonists Charlie Parker and Lester Young, pianists Thelonious Monk, Oscar Peterson, Dave Brubeck, and Fats Waller, and Delta bluesman Robert Johnson. He {{is also a}} pianist and composer. Jazz has {{played an important role}} in Eastwood's life from a young age and, although he never made it as a professional musician, he <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> influence to his son Kyle Eastwood, a successful jazz bassist and composer. Eastwood developed as a boogie-woogie pianist early on and had originally intended to pursue a career in music by studying for a music theory degree after graduating from high school. In late 1959 he produced the album Cowboy Favorites, released on the Cameo label.|$|E
5|$|Edmund Crouchback <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> castle to {{his eldest}} son, Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, in 1298. Lancaster married Alice de Lacy, {{which made him}} the richest nobleman in England. Kenilworth became the primary castle of the Lancaster estates, {{replacing}} Bolingbroke, and acted as both a social and a financial centre for Thomas. Thomas built the first great hall at the castle from 1314 to 1317 and constructed the Water Tower along the outer bailey, as well as increasing {{the size of the}} chase. Lancaster, with support from many of the other English barons, found himself in increasing opposition to Edward II. War broke out in 1322, and Lancaster was captured at the Battle of Boroughbridge and executed. His estates, including Kenilworth, were confiscated by the crown. Edward and his wife, Isabella of France, spent Christmas 1323 at Kenilworth, amidst major celebrations.|$|E
