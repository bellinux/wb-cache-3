50|$|<b>Penile</b> <b>plethysmography</b> (PPG) or phallometry is {{measurement}} of bloodflow to the penis, typically {{used as a}} proxy for {{measurement of}} sexual arousal. The most commonly reported methods of conducting <b>penile</b> <b>plethysmography</b> involve the measurement of the circumference of the penis with a mercury-in-rubber or electromechanical strain gauge, or the volume of the penis with an airtight cylinder and inflatable cuff {{at the base of the}} penis. Corpora cavernosa nerve penile plethysmographs measure changes in response to inter-operative electric stimulation during surgery. The volumetric procedure was invented by Kurt Freund and is considered to be particularly sensitive at low arousal levels.

50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{response}} involved with sexual behaviour in males is penile erection. The {{use of the}} volume (or circumference) change during penile erection as a convenient measure of sexual arousal was first developed by Kurt Freund. This measurement of {{blood flow to the}} male genitals is known as <b>penile</b> <b>plethysmography.</b> This is commonly measured using a strain gauge, a simple mercury strain gauge encompassed in a ring of rubber. The ring surrounds the penis, but does not constrict or cause discomfort. The measure has been found by some to be a reliable and valid measurement of male arousal. More recently, thermography has been developed to measure the physiological measurements of sexual arousal. Studies have found temperature change specific to the genitals during sexual arousal, which supports the validity of this measure.|$|E

5000|$|Several <b>penile</b> <b>plethysmography</b> {{studies have}} shown high levels of arousal in {{heterosexual}} men to pornography showing sexual activity between women. One study found heterosexual men to have the highest genital and subjective arousals to pornography depicting heterosexual activity, rather than lesbian activity, while another study reported that on average heterosexual men are more aroused by pornography showing sexual activity between women than they are by depictions of heterosexual activity. These findings correspond with reports in several earlier studies (summarized in Whitley et al. (1999); see also anecdotal reports in Loftus (2002)).Male perception of lesbianism as erotic {{has been shown to}} correspond with recent exposure to lesbian pornography; however, men who have recently viewed lesbian pornography are no more likely than others to perceive lesbians as hypersexual and/or bisexual. Bernard E. Whitley, Jr., et al. hypothesized, upon reaching this conclusion, that [...] "pornography may ... lead heterosexual men to view lesbianism as erotic by means of a generalized association of female-female sexual activity with sexual arousal", but noted that [...] "more research is needed to clarify the relationship between exposure to pornography and the perceived erotic value of lesbianism." ...|$|E

His larger research program, however, focused on detection and diagnosis of sex offenders, particularly preference pedophiles, {{with a view to}} more appropriate treatment guidelines. Freund was also involved in administering conversion therapy: [...] "Freund made a large-scale attempt in Czechoslovakia in the 1950s to change the sexual orientation of homosexuals to a heterosexual orientation through the use of behavioral aversive therapy." [...] His empirical data also showed some of the first evidence that sexual orientation conversion therapy was generally futile. He demonstrated that even homosexually oriented men who appeared to have given up sexual relations with other men and established heterosexual marriages were still aroused by images of men rather than women. Freund also challenged contemporary psychoanalytic theories of male homosexuality that suggested it was due to a fear or aversion to women. Freund concluded that homosexual men simply lacked erotic interest in females. Based on these studies, he advocated the decriminalization of homosexuality in Czechoslovakia (which took place in 1961) and the end of conversion therapy. These opinions also put him out of favor with the psychoanalytically dominated psychiatric establishment in Toronto, as he continued to argue that homosexuals needed understanding and acceptance rather than treatment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{output of}} the VPG can be {{filtered}} into two types of signals, which have different properties. The direct current signal, {{is a measure of}} vaginal blood volume (VBV) and reflects the total blood volume in the vaginal tissues. The alternating current signal is a measure vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA) and reflects the pressure change within the blood vessels of the vaginal wall associated with each heartbeat [...] While changes in VBV occur in response to sexual and anxiety-inducing stimuli, changes in VPA only occur in response to sexual stimuli. Since VPA is a more sensitive and specific measure of sexual arousal, many researchers use it instead of VBV. VPA is defined as the peak-to-trough amplitude of the vaginal pulse wave. It is calculated by subtracting the means of all troughs from the means of all peaks experienced during stimulus presentation.VPA lacks an absolute scale of measurement; each unit of change (mV) does not correspond directly with a physiological change (cf. <b>penile</b> <b>plethysmography).</b> Since VPA does not have a standard unit of measurement it is difficult for researchers to make between-participant comparisons. Being said that, in 2009, a group of engineers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute developed a real-time wavelet-based algorithm that can create a relatively accurate data analysis system using VPA signals. They claimed that their method has made it possible to perform between-participant comparisons.|$|E

The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the degree of control men have over their sexual arousal while receiving both cognitive and vibrotactile stimulation. More specifically,this study examined the ability of males to suppress penile tumescence to preferred sexual stimuli as well as their ability to enhance tumuscence to nonpreferred and neutral stimuli. Participants were randomly assigned to view one of three 4 -minute video clips(heterosexual scene,homosexual scene,or neutral scene) while also receiving low-level penile vibrotactile stimulation. A 3 X 2 X 2 mixed model MANOVA was used to analyse the data. The results indicated that while receiving low-level vibrotactile stimulation,participants were able to "enhance" sexual arousal when instructed to do so regardless of video type but had much greater difficulty "suppressing" sexual arousal to the preferred video. Furthermore, under "enhance" instructions,mean and peak tumescence measures were not significantly difficult when comparing men who viewed a heterosexual VS homosexual video.

40|$|This is {{the first}} of two papers which briefly outline the {{development}} of behavioral and cognitive behavioral treatment of sexual offenders from the mid- 1800 s to 1969. We first consider the historic role of Sigmund Freud and note that a broad scientific interest in deviant sexual behavior was well established by 1900. In the early to mid- 20 th century, two psychologies were prominent in the development of behavioral approaches, those of John B. Watson and Alfred Kinsey. Behavior therapy for a variety of problems emerged in the 1950 s and soon found application to deviant sexuality. The development of <b>penile</b> <b>plethysmography</b> helped to focus interest on deviant sexual preference and behavior. While nonbehavioral approaches to sexual offenders paralleled these developments, a combination of behavioral and cognitive behavioral treatments began to emerge in the late 1960 s which ultimately developed into the approaches more commonly seen today.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the cerebral correlates of the early phase, and of low to moderate levels, of penile tumescence using for the first time a volumetric measure of the penile response. We hypothesized that (i) regions whose response had been found correlated with circumferential penile responses in previous studies would be identified with volumetric plethysmography and (ii) that other brain regions, including the amygdalae, would be found using the more sensitive volumetric measurement. In ten healthy males, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to study brain responses to sexually stimulating photographs and to various categories of control photographs. Both ratings of perceived erection and <b>penile</b> <b>plethysmography</b> demonstrated an erectile response to the presentation of sexually stimulating photographs. Regions where the BOLD signal was correlated with penile volumetric responses included the right medial prefrontal cortex, the right and left orbitofrontal cortices, the insulae, the paracentral lobules, the right ventral lateral thalamic nucleus, the right anterior cingulate cortex and regions involved in motor imagery and motor preparation (supplementary motor areas, left ventral premotor area). This study suggests that the development of low levels of penile tumescence in response to static sexual stimuli is controlled by a network of frontal, parietal, insular and cingulate cortical areas and that penile tumescence reciprocally induces activation in somatosensory regions of the brain...|$|E
