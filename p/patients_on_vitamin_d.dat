40|$|Falls {{represent}} {{a significant contribution}} to the morbidity and mortality of the elderly population. Because vitamin D is important in bone physiology, the use of vitamin D to restore deficient bone and ameliorate the effects of bone fractures due to falls has become a common practice in recent years. Following introduction of widespread use, reports began to emerge that vitamin D not only aided in repair of fall-induced bone fractures, but that it also reduced the occurrence of falls. Vitamin D now has become a routine intervention as a fall-prevention measure. Early analyses found evidence of prevention efficacy (reduced falls), but recent analyses are more equivocal. We retrospectively examined the records of 350 patients in a long-term care facility in which vitamin D administration and the number of falls were recorded as part of a comprehensive database of care. We found a dramatic rise in vitamin D use over the period covered (2006 – 2011) and a corresponding dramatic {{decrease in the number of}} falls. However, the number of falls continued to decline after 2008, despite a plateau in number of <b>patients</b> <b>on</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D,</b> particularly females. It appears that other factors contribute to the overall decline...|$|E
40|$|Background: There is high {{prevalence}} of vitamin-D deficiency and abnormal bone mineral density (BMD) in HIV patients. Our {{aim is to}} find out the effect of replacement of low dose oral vitamin-D (800 International unit) with calcium (500 mg) as a once daily regimen along with antiretroviral (ARV) on serum vitamin-D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) level and bone mineral density (BMD) changes on patients with HIV infection who have vitamin- D deficiency. Methods: This is a non-randomised, open label study. We collected information about demography, viral load, CD- 4 count, fracture risk factors. We measured serum 25 (OH) D, parathyroid hormone (intact PTH), inorganic phosphate, corrected calcium, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and BMD of hip and spine at baseline and after 12 months of routine follow up. Patients were treatment experienced and were divided into tenofovir containing, efavirenz containing, and protease Inhibitor (PI) containing regimens. Results: The study included 87 treatment experienced HIV patients with mean age 42. 8 (+/- 7. 8) years, 55 (63 %) females, 73 (84 %) black African ethnicity, CD 4 count 451. 7 (+/- 184. 6) cells/dL, plasma VL 1. 6 log (+/- 0. 03) copies/mL, exposure to antiretroviral therapy 43. 2 (+/- 30. 2) months and duration of illness 58. 4 (+/- 24. 1) months. Forty four patients agreed to take vitamin-D with calcium replacement and 43 patients did not agree to take the replacement. After 12 months of follow up <b>patients</b> <b>on</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> and calcium replacement (n= 44) had significant increase in vitamin-D level (15. 4 +/- 6. 2 vs. 55. 9 +/- 22. 6, p= 0. 0001), reduction in PTH (8. 04 +/- 7. 5, vs. 4. 7 +/- 1. 8, p= 0. 005), alkaline phosphatase (111. 1 +/- 79. 1 vs. 90. 2 +/- 42. 2, p= 0. 038) and increase in corrected calcium (2. 18 +/- 0. 09 vs. 2. 19 +/- 0. 09 p= 0. 001). In patients not on vitamin-D replacement (n= 43), there was increase in vitamin-D (16. 9 +/- 12. 1 vs. 49. 4 +/- 29. 2, p= 0. 001) and corrected calcium (2. 12 +/- 0. 09 vs. 2. 16 +/- 0. 08 p= 0. 0001) level, but PTH and ALP did not change. BMD of hip and spine did not show any significant change in either of the two groups. In multivariate analysis that included all significant variables, vitamin-D and calcium replacement independently was associated with increase in vitamin-D level (OR 1. 07, CI 1. 02, 1. 12, p= 0. 005), decrease in PTH level (OR 0. 53, CI 0. 35, 0. 82, p= 0. 004), but not with change in corrected calcium, alkaline phosphatase, BMD of hip or spine. Conclusion: After 12 months of follow up, replacement of low dose once daily oral vitamin-D with calcium in treatment experienced HIV patients with vitamin-D deficiency can increase vitamin-D level, reduce PTH level without any change in BMD of hip and spine...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE), ANCA-assiociated vasculitides (AAV) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) are autoimmune systemic small and medium vessels vasculitides. In these diseases {{a shift from}} immune tolerance to autoimmunity has occurred. <b>Vitamin</b> <b>d,</b> an immunomodulatory secosteroid hormone, {{may play a role}} in this shift to autoimmune response. This review aims to study the relation of <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> level to SLE, AAV and SSc disease activity. Methods: Articles were located on pubmed using searches for <b>vitamin</b> <b>d,</b> SLE, AAV, SSc and associated terminology. Only for <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> and disease activity in SLE sufficient articles were found for a systematic review. For adequate structuring of this part of the review the PRISMA guidelines for reporting of systematic reviews were used. Results: <b>Vitamin</b> <b>d</b> has multiple immunomodulatory effects capable of positively influencing SLE, AAV and SSc. Monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, T-cells and B-cells are affected in such a way that infections and auto-immunity may be prevented. Based on current literature, multiple changes in the immune system of the illnesses occur that can be explained by <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> deficiency. Studies <b>on</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> in SLE and SSc indicate that deficiency may be more prevalent than in healthy controls.

This study aimed {{to assess the}} rate of thrombotic events and major bleedings in adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) and atrial arrhythmias, {{as well as to}} determine the predictive value of specific clinical features and two risk scores for thromboembolism and bleeding. In this retrospective study, a total of 229 adult CHD patients with atrial arrhythmias, were included. Incidence and risk factors of thromboembolism were assessed in patients without a mechanical valve (n = 191), whereas bleeding incidence and risk factors were studied in patients receiving vitamin K antagonists (n = 164). In 13 patients without a mechanical valve thrombotic events occurred, the first thrombotic event rate per year being 1. 4 %. A total of 29 <b>patients</b> <b>on</b> <b>vitamin</b> K antagonists suffered from major bleedings, at an annual first event rate of 4. 4 %. CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score and HAS-BLED score predicted thromboembolic and bleeding risk best in a dichotomized form. At a cut-off of ≥ 2 for high risk the rate of thrombotic events was 3. 0 % per year compared to 0. 7 % for a score of < 2 (HR 3. 7; 95 %-CI 1. 2 - 11. 5; p = 0. 021).

40|$|International audienceObjective: Little {{is known}} about {{practice}} patterns regarding shoulder glucocorticoid injections in patients taking antiplatelet drugs or vitamin K antagonists. The objective {{of this study was}} to collect relevant data among rheumatologists in France. Methods: We conducted a postal questionnaire survey among 2015 rheumatologists. Results: We received 1018 completed questionnaires (response rate, 1018 / 2015, 50. 5 %). The proportion of rheumatologists who discontinued drugs with antithrombotic effects prior to shoulder injections varied across drugs, as follows: nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 2. 6 %; dipyridamole, 7. 5 %; aspirin, 9 %; ticlopidine, 25 %; clopidogrel, 28 %; and vitamin K antagonists, 74 %. Among rheumatologists who discontinued vitamin K antagonist therapy, 82 % prescribed replacement therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin. Time from discontinuation to injection was not consistently appropriate to the duration of drug effects. Prior to the injection, hemostasis tests were obtained by 1 % of rheumatologists for <b>patients</b> <b>on</b> NSAIDs, 6 % for those on clopidogrel, and 65 % for those <b>on</b> <b>vitamin</b> K antagonists. Only 1 % of rheumatologists had observed bleeding events in <b>patients</b> <b>on</b> aspirin, compared to 10 % in <b>patients</b> <b>on</b> <b>vitamin</b> K antagonists. The mean number of shoulder glucocorticoid injections per rheumatologist per month was 19. 6; 4 % of rheumatologists routinely obtained hemostasis tests before shoulder injections. Conclusion: Considerable variations were found among rheumatologists regarding practice patterns for performing shoulder glucocorticoid injections.

We performed an international registry to describe current treatment strategies and factors associated with therapeutic decisions in a large prospective cohort of unselected SVT patients. A total of 613 patients were enrolled (mean age 53. 1 years, standard deviation ± 14. 8); 62. 6 % males; the majority (468 patients) had portal {{vein thrombosis}}. Most common risk factors included cirrhosis (27. 8 %), solid cancer (22. 3 %), and intra-abdominal inflammation/infection (11. 7 %); in 27. 4 % of patients, SVT was idiopathic.

40|$|Objective: Emergency {{physicians}} frequently {{deal with}} <b>patients</b> <b>on</b> <b>vitamin</b> K antagonists (VKAs) suffering major bleeding events, and rapid reversal of anticoagulation {{in this setting}} is of paramount importance. In Italy, given the absence of specific national guidelines, local policies are likely to differ, possibly impacting on clinical outcomes. We decided to perform a telephone survey among Italian emergency physicians to evaluate management strategies for VKAs reversal in patients with major bleeding. Methods: We conducted a computer-assisted, 10 -minute telephone survey of 15 questions, focusing on the local prevalence, assessment, and management strategies of major and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) occurring in <b>patients</b> <b>on</b> VKAs. We planned to interview a sample of 320 Italian emergency physicians. Institutions from all geographic areas of Italy were {{to participate in the}} survey. Results: Of the 320 physicians contacted, 150 (47 %) completed the survey, 95 % being employed in public hospitals. Focusing on ICH, only 29 % of the responders stated they would reverse anticoagulation irrespective of the international nor-malized ratio value, and only 27 % would use prothrombin-complex concentrate as first-line agent. In patients needing urgent neurosurgical operation, less than 50 % would administer prothrombin-complex concentrate before surgery. Conclusion: The average knowledge of management strategies for reversal of anticoagulation displayed by Italian emergency physicians appears to be unsatisfactory.

The Study to Evaluate Carotid Ultrasound changes in patients treated with Ramipril and vitamin E (SECURE), a substudy of the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial, was a prospective, double-blind, 332 factorial design trial that evaluated the effects of long-term treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril and <b>vitamin</b> E <b>on</b> atherosclerosis progression in high-risk patients. Methods and Results—A total of 732 patients $ 55 years of age who had vascular disease or diabetes {{and at least one}} other risk factor and who did not have heart failure or a low left ventricular ejection fraction were randomly assigned to receive ramipril 2. 5 mg/d or 10 mg/d and vitamin E (RRR-a-tocopheryl acetate) 400 IU/d or their matching placebos. Average follow-up was 4. 5 years. Atherosclerosis progression was evaluated by B-mode carotid ultrasound. The progression slope of the mean maximum carotid intimal medial thickness was 0. 0217 mm/year in the placebo group, 0. 0180 mm/year in the ramipril 2. 5 mg/d group, and 0. 0137 mm/year in the ramipril 10 mg/d group (P 50. 033).

Methods:The Cerebral Haemorrhage in patients Restarting Oral Anticoagulant Therapy (CHIRONE) Study collected data of patients eligible for the study from the database of 27 centers affiliated with the Italian Federation of Anticoagulation Clinics. Results:We enrolled 267 patients (163 male, median age 73. 9 years) who had received VKA anticoagulation after an ICH event. During the total period of follow-up (778 patient-years), ICH recurred in 20 patients (7. 5 %; rate 2. 56 x 100 patient-years) at a median time of 16. 5 months, and was fatal in 5 patients (25 %; rate 0. 4 x 100 patient-years). Male sex, hypertension, prosthetic valves, previous ischemic stroke, renal failure, cancer, and spontaneous events {{were associated with the}} risk of recurrence, though none of them in isolation reached statistical significance. More than one-third of spontaneous recurrences occurred in patients with a posttraumatic index event. Conclusions:Our results show that patients with a history of ICH carry a significant risk of recurrent ICH when treated with VKA anticoagulation. The risk is also present, though to a lower degree, in patients with previous posttraumatic events.

During a mean follow-up of 8. 82 (± 3. 59) months, 50 bleeding events occurred (13 MB and 37 CRNMB), for an overall bleeding incidence of 9. 99 / 100 patient-years. The rate of bleeding was higher in the first three months of treatment (15. 86 / 100 patient-years) than afterwards (7. 13 / 100 patient-years). The HAS-BLED showed the best predictive value for bleeding complications during the first three months of treatment (area under the curve [AUC] 0. 68, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 59 – 0. 78), while only the ACCP score showed a modest predictive value after the initial three months (AUC 0. 61, 95 %CI 0. 51 – 0. 72).

Vitamin D {{is an important}} hormone for mineral homeostasis and the proper formation and maintenance of bone. In addition, vitamin D has broader functions in the body that expand its traditionally known role in mineral balance. In chronic renal failure, calcitriol deficiency contributes to the development and progression of secondary hyperparathyroidism, bone disorders, and altered mineral metabolism. Recent revelations of the broader role of vitamin D also suggest calcitriol deficiency may contribute to decreased cardiac and immune function in chronic renal failure <b>patients.</b> Research <b>on</b> <b>vitamin</b> D {{has led to a}} more complete understanding of the actions of vitamin D at the transcriptional level and with respect to the clinical use of vitamin D and its analogs to control parathyroid hormone overactivity and to replace the other D hormone-dependent actions in patients with renal failure.

Compared to pre-hospitalization values, the levels of hemoglobin, albumin, phosphorus, calcium, and parathyroid hormone and weight were significantly decreased after hospitalization. Using covariate-adjusted models, those patients whose hemoglobin was monitored within the first 7 days after discharge, followed by modification of their erythropoietin dose had a significantly reduced risk for repeat-hospitalization when compared to the patients whose hemoglobin was not checked, nor was the dose of erythropoietin changed.

Given his oxalate-rich diet, chronic diarrhea, and daily 680 mg vitamin C and furosemide, we postulated Ca oxalate-induced nephropathy, a diagnosis confirmed by documenting hyperoxaluria, and finding of diffuse intraluminal crystals and extensive interstitial fibrosis on biopsy. He was hemodialysed 6 times to remove excess oxalate. Two weeks off vitamin C, his creatinine spontaneously fell to 3. 1 mg/dL. Three months later, on low oxalate diet and 100 mg vitamin B 6, urine oxalate to creatinine ratio decreased from 0. 084 to 0. 02 (normal Conclusion 1) High-dose vitamin C can induce hyperoxaluric nephropathy and progressive renal failure, especially if aggravated by diarrhea, oxalate-rich diet, metabolic acidosis, and dehydration. 2) The diagnosis should be suspected in unexplained renal insufficiency when {{associated with these}} risk factors. 3) Since prompt treatment could avert end-stage renal disease, we recommend monitoring urinary oxalate in <b>patients</b> <b>on</b> high-dose <b>vitamin</b> C and renal biopsy if necessary. </p...|$|R

Single daily dose of folate was as effective as a combination of folate and cobalamin in reducing plasma homocysteine concentrations. Low levels of B 12 contribute to the higher incidence of cerebrovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease, and low folate levels account for higher prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease. Moreover, irrespective of the cause of hyperhomocysteinemia, folate is known to ameliorate it. Hence, large-scale corrective measures like food fortification or dietary supplementation with folate might benefit the Indian population and reduce the incidence and morbidity of vascular disease...|$|R

DESIGN: Observational prospective multicentre cohort study. SETTING: Atherothrombosis Center of I Clinica Medica of 'Sapienza' University of Rome; Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences of University Magna Græcia of Catanzaro; Atrial Fibrillation Registry for Ankle-Brachial Index Prevalence Assessment-Collaborative Italian Study. PARTICIPANTS: 897 AF <b>patients</b> <b>on</b> treatment with <b>vitamin</b> K antagonists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The relationship between basal ABI and renal function progression, assessed by the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) calculated with the CKD-EPI formula at baseline and after 2  years of follow-up. The rapid decline in eGFR, defined as a decline in eGFR > 5  mL/min/ 1. 73  m(2) /year, and incident eGFR< 60  mL/min/ 1. 73  m(2) were primary and secondary end points, respectively.

40|$|The {{effects of}} vitamin D and calcium {{deficiency}} {{are evident in}} several patients suffering from various diseases including osteoporosis and rickets. Other hormones such as glucocorticoids {{also play a role}} in bone homeostasis leading to bone growth promotion or retardation. Consequently, hormone imbalances in patients should be considered with suspected vitamin D and calcium deficiency. The deficiency of vitamin D and calcium lead to non-bone related abnormalities for instance promotion of prostate cancer and retardation of blood clotting, respectively. However, this study will be focusing on the detrimental effects of osteoporosis and rickets <b>on</b> <b>patients.</b> <b>Vitamin</b> D and calcium deficiency may be prevented by adequate sun exposure as well as diet supplementation. Vitamin D and calcium deficiency result in lack of intracellular mechanisms, loss of bone matrix and density hence, weaker bones. This leads to an increased probability of bone fractures. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Background Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is {{a potent}} {{calcification}} inhibitor of the arterial wall. Its activity depends <b>on</b> <b>vitamin</b> K-dependent γ-carboxyglutamate. Aim We aimed to investigate the effect of <b>vitamin</b> K 1 <b>on</b> MGP levels after 3 months’ supplementation {{and the relationship between}} MGP level and vascular calcification. Patients and methods A prospective case–control pilot study was conducted over a period of 3 months. The study included 57 long-term hemodialysis patients in stable conditions who were divided into two groups and were compared with 27 healthy age-matched controls. Group I consisted of 28 hemodialysis patients who received vitamin K 1 at 10 [*]mg three times per week for a successive period of 3 months. Group II consisted of 29 hemodialysis patients who did not receive vitamin K. Group III consisted of 27 healthy participants as controls. The serum level of MGP was measured by radioimmunoassay; in addition, hemoglobin%, parathyroid hormone, calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, alkaline phosphatase, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and carotid intima–media thickness were also measured. Plain radiograph of the abdomen in lateral view was acquired to determine the abdominal aortic calcification score {{at the start of the}} study, which was reassessed after 3 months in groups I and II. Results We found a significant increase in blood pressure, body mass index (BMI) with elevation in the serum level of MGP in patient groups than control from the start. A significant elevation in MGP level was observed in group I accompanied by a decrease in serum cholesterol level, compared with group II. We did not find any significant change in carotid intima–media thickness or abdominal aortic calcification score in either group after 3 months. There was no significant correlation between elevated MGP level and vascular calcification either. No significant difference was found in other parameters. Conclusion Vitamin K supplementation may be essential for End Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD) <b>patients</b> <b>on</b> hemodialysis. <b>Vitamin</b> K can increase the level of MGP and decrease cholesterol level, but its beneficial effect on the vascular bed needs a long-term study...|$|R
