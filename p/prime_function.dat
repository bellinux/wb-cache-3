25|$|The {{governing}} {{body of a}} district is the twice-yearly synod. Each district is presided over by a chair, except the large London District which has three chairs. A chair was, at first, a superintendent of a circuit within the district, but now ministers are appointed exclusively to the role. The <b>prime</b> <b>function</b> of the chair is pastoral—the care of ministers, and lay workers, and their families, within the district; the appointment of ministers to circuits; candidates for the ministry and the oversight of probationer (trainee) ministers. The district chair will also be the person to whom churches of other denominations relate ecumenically at regional or national level.|$|E
25|$|The royal council or witan {{played a}} central but limited role in the Anglo-Saxon period. The main feature of the system was its high degree of decentralisation. The {{interference}} by the king through his granting of charters and the activity of his witan in litigation are exceptions {{rather than the rule}} in Anglo-Saxon times. The most important court in the later Anglo-Saxon period was the Shire Court. It is of interest that many shires (such as Kent and Sussex) were {{in the early days of}} the Anglo-Saxon settlement the centre of small independent kingdoms. As the kings first of Mercia and then of Wessex slowly extended their authority over the whole of England they left the Shire Courts with overall responsibility for the administration of law. The Shire met in one or more traditional places, earlier in the open air and then later in a Moot or meeting hall. The meeting of the Shire Court was presided over by an officer, the shire reeve or sheriff, whose appointment came in later Anglo-Saxon times into the hands of the king but had in earlier times been elective. The sheriff was not the judge of the court, merely its president. The judges of the court were all those who had the right and duty of attending the court, the suitors. These were originally all free male inhabitants of the neighbourhood but, over time, suit of court became an obligation attached to particular holdings of land. The sessions of a Shire Court resembled more closely those of a modern local administrative body than a modern court. It could and did act judicially but this was not its <b>prime</b> <b>function.</b> In the Shire Court, charters and writs would be read out for all to hear.|$|E

60|$|But imagination, the {{function}} of the historian, cannot let so great an element alone. By the cheap revolutionary it is commonly supposed that imagination is a merely rebellious thing, that it has its chief function in devising new and fantastic republics. But imagination has its highest use in a retrospective realization. The trumpet of imagination, like the trumpet of the Resurrection, calls the dead out of their graves. Imagination sees Delphi with the eyes of a Greek, Jerusalem with the eyes of a Crusader, Paris with the eyes of a Jacobin, and Arcadia with the eyes of a Euphuist. The <b>prime</b> <b>function</b> of imagination is to see our whole orderly system of life as a pile of stratified revolutions. In spite of all revolutionaries it must be said that {{the function}} of imagination is not to make strange things settled, so much as to make settled things strange; not so much to make wonders facts as to make facts wonders. To the imaginative the truisms are all paradoxes, since they were paradoxes in the Stone Age; to them the ordinary copy-book blazes with blasphemy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Sums over inverse s-th {{powers of}} semiprimes and k-almost primes are {{transformed}} into sums over products of powers of ordinary <b>prime</b> zeta <b>functions.</b> Multinomial coefficients {{known from the}} cycle decomposition of permutation groups {{play the role of}} expansion coefficients. Founded on a known convergence acceleration for the ordinary <b>prime</b> zeta <b>functions,</b> the sums and first derivatives are tabulated with high precision for indices k = 2, [...] ., 6 and integer powers s = 2, [...] ., 8. 1. Overview Series over rational polynomials evaluated at integer arguments contain subseries summing over integers classified by the count of their prime factors. The core example is the Riemann zeta function ζ which accumulates the <b>prime</b> zeta <b>function</b> P 1 plus what we shall define the almost-prime zeta functions Pk (Section 2). The central observation of this manuscript is that the almost-prime zeta functions are combinatorial sums over the <b>prime</b> zeta <b>function</b> (Section 3). Since earlier work by Cohen, Sebah and Gourdon has pointed at efficient numerical algorithms to compute P 1, series over reciprocal almost-primes—which may suffer from slow convergence in their defining format—may be computed efficiently by reference to the P 1. In consequence, any converging series over the positive integers which has a Taylor expansion in reciprocal powers of these integers splits into k-almost prime components. Section 4 illustrates this for the most basic formats. Number theory as such will not be advanced. The meromorphic landscape of the <b>prime</b> zeta <b>functions</b> as a function of their main variable appears to be more complicated than what is known for their host, the Riemann zeta function; so only some remarks on the calculation of first derivatives are dropped. 2. <b>Prime</b> Zeta <b>Function</b> Definition 1.

40|$|SummaryPriming of {{secretory}} vesicles is {{a prerequisite}} for their Ca 2 +-dependent fusion with the plasma membrane. The key vesicle priming proteins, Munc 13 s and CAPSs, are thought to mediate vesicle priming by regulating the conformation of the t-SNARE syntaxin, thereby facilitating SNARE complex assembly. Munc 13 s execute their <b>priming</b> <b>function</b> through their MUN domain. Given that the MUN domain of Ca 2 +-dependent activator protein for secretion (CAPS) also binds syntaxin, it was assumed that CAPSs prime vesicles through the same mechanism as Munc 13 s. We studied naturally occurring splice variants of CAPS 2 in CAPS 1 /CAPS 2 -deficient cells and found that CAPS 2 primes vesicles independently of its MUN domain. Instead, the pleckstrin homology domain of CAPS 2 seemingly is essential for its <b>priming</b> <b>function.</b> Our findings indicate a priming mode for secretory vesicles. This process apparently requires membrane phospholipids, does not involve the binding or direct conformational regulation of syntaxin by MUN domains of CAPSs, and is therefore not redundant with Munc 13 action...|$|R
