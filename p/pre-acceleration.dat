Pre-Safe with {{pedestrian}} {{detection and}} City Brake function {{is a combination}} of stereo camera and radar sensors to detect pedestrians in front of the vehicle. Visual and acoustic warnings are triggered when a hazard is spotted. If the driver then reacts by braking, the braking power will be boosted as the situation requires, up to a full brake application. Should the driver fail to react, Pre-Safe Brake triggers autonomous vehicle braking. Pedestrian detection is active up to about 72 km/h , and is able to reduce collisions with pedestrians autonomously from an initial speed of up to 50 km/h. A radar sensor in the rear bumper monitors the traffic behind the vehicle. If the risk of an impact from the rear is detected, the rear hazard warning lights are activated to alert the driver of the vehicle behind (not on vehicles with USA/Canada coding). Anticipatory occupant protection measures, such as the reversible belt tensioners, are deployed. If the vehicle is stopped and the driver indicates a wish to remain stationary - by depressing the brake pedal, activating the hold function, or moving the selector lever to [...] "P" [...] - the system increases the brake pressure to keep the vehicle firmly braked during a possible rear-end collision.

Our high-resolution large-scale numerical experiments sample a representative portion of the shock surface and demonstrate that the efficiency of electron injection is strongly modulated with the phase of the shock reformation. For plasmas with low and moderate temperature (plasma beta β_ p= 5 · 10 ^- 4 and β_ p= 0. 5), we explore the nonlinear shock structure and electron <b>pre-acceleration</b> for various orientations of the large-scale magnetic field {{with respect to the}} simulation plane while keeping it at 90 ^∘ to the shock normal.

In all cases under study, the latter provides first-stage electron energization through the shock-surfing acceleration (SSA) mechanism. The subsequent energization strongly depends on the field orientation and proceeds through adiabatic or second-order Fermi acceleration processes for configurations with the out-of-plane and in-plane field components, respectively.

The widely-accepted theory of the particle acceleration, so-called diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) or Fermi mechanism, requires seed electrons with modest energy with gamma ~ 1 - 100, and little is known about this <b>pre-acceleration</b> mechanism: We derive the energy distribution of relativistic electrons in this pre-accelerated energy regime. We find that the efficiency of the electron acceleration must be low, i. e., epsilon_e <~ 0. 01 as compared to the conventionally assumed value of epsilon_e ~ 0. 1. Furthermore, independently from the low value of epsilon_e, we find that the X-ray luminosity cannot be attributed to any emission mechanisms suggested so far as long as these electrons follow the conventionally-assumed single power-law distribution. A consistent view between the radio and X-ray can only be obtained if the <b>pre-acceleration</b> injection spectrum peaks at gamma ~ 20 - 30 and then only a fraction of these electrons eventually experience the DSA-like acceleration toward the higher energy [...] then the radio and X-ray properties are explained through the synchrotron and inverse Compton mechanisms, respectively. Our findings support the idea that the <b>pre-acceleration</b> of the electrons is coupled with the generation/amplification of the magnetic field.

However, while the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac equation has pathological solutions of <b>pre-acceleration</b> and runaway, the Landau-Lifshitz equation and its finite higher order extensions are free of these problems. So it seems mysterious that the property of solutions of these two equations is so different.

3000|$|Let us {{discuss the}} {{plausible}} scenario of the energetic ion acceleration up to 1 MeV {{is from the}} result of our observation. Our observations show that the energetic ions (∼ 1 MeV) and electrons (> 38 keV) seem to be accelerated at the same place. The standard energetic electron acceleration mechanism is that the unmagnetized electrons {{in the vicinity of}} the X-type diffusion region can be accelerated by strong inductive electric field during the meandering/Speiser motion. The polarization electric field in a thin current sheet can also contribute to electron <b>pre-acceleration.</b> Furthermore, accelerated electrons, which have a large gyroradius, are then transported outward from the diffusion region and are further accelerated around the piled-up magnetic field region because of ∇B drift and/or curvature drift under the nonadiabatic motion (Hoshino 2005). The reconnection electric field is important for energetic ion and electron acceleration, because ions and electrons get energy from it. For energetic electron acceleration, the pre-acceleration/heating is crucial to get large gyroradius for second-step acceleration. The electron <b>pre-acceleration</b> and/or heating are generally defined by the small-scale plasma condition. This is the reason why the energetic electron acceleration efficiency is well correlated with small-scale parameter of magnetic reconnection. On the other hand, for energetic ion acceleration, the gyroradius is large enough for second-step acceleration. Hot ions at the piled-up magnetic field region can be accelerated without any <b>pre-acceleration.</b> However, the spatial scale size of the acceleration region is conclusive for energetic ion acceleration up to 1 MeV. In the case of reconnection electric field of 10 mV m − 1, the spatial scale needs to be at least 10 5 km (∼magnetosphere width) to accelerate ions up to 1 MeV.

40|$|Observations of {{synchrotron}} radiation {{across a wide}} range of wavelengths provide clear evidence that electrons are accelerated to relativistic energies in supernova remnants (SNRs). However, a viable mechanism for the <b>pre-acceleration</b> of such electrons to mildly relativistic energies has not yet been established. In this paper an electromagnetic particle-in-cell (PIC) code is used to simulate acceleration of electrons from background energies to tens of keV at perpendicular collisionless shocks associated with SNRs. Free energy for electron energization is provided by ions reflected from the shock front, with speeds greater than the upstream electron thermal speed. The PIC simulation results contain several new features, including: the acceleration, rather than heating, of electrons via the Buneman instability; the acceleration of electrons to speeds exceeding those of the shock-reflected ions producing the instability; and strong acceleration of electrons perpendicular to the magnetic field. Electron energization takes place through a variety of resonant and non-resonant processes, of which the strongest involves stochastic wave-particle interactions. In SNRs the diffusive shock process could then supply the final step required for the production of fully relativistic electrons. The mechanisms identified in this paper thus provide a possible solution to the electron <b>pre-acceleration</b> problem. Comment: 36 pages, 13 figure...|$|E

40|$|Explorations of new {{technologies}} and dance often focus on the difficulty of locating gesture-as-such. For the practitioners of dance and technology the exploration of movement is intrinsically related to how to locate where a movement begins and ends in order to map its coordinates within a sensitive system. Yet, the question "What is a gesture? (and how can the computer recognize one?) " may direct the techno-dance process toward establishing a kind of grammar of movement that would — paradoxically — {{be more likely to}} tie the body to some pre-established understanding of how it actualizes. "Mapping" gesture risks breaking movement into bits of assimilable data, of replicating the very conformity the computer software is seeking to get beyond. Instead of mapping gesture-as-such, this paper therefore begins somewhere else. It seeks to explore the technogenetic potential of the wholeness of movement, including its "unmappable" virtuality. The unmappable — within a computer software program — is the aspect of movement I call <b>pre-acceleration,</b> a virtual becoming — a tendency toward movement — through which a displacement takes form.
