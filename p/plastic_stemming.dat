After embryogenesis, however, the fate of neuronal progenitors becomes more restricted, and they generate only a subset of neurons. Here, we review studies of postnatal and adult neurogenesis, challenging the notion that fixed genetic programs restrict neuronal fate. We hypothesize that the adult brain maintains <b>plastic</b> neural <b>stem</b> cells {{that are capable of}} responding to changes in environmental cues and generating diverse neuronal types.

40|$|<b>Plastic</b> {{increases}} in <b>stem</b> elongation in dense vegetation are generally {{believed to be}} induced by canopy shading, but because plants protect each other from wind, shielding (reduced mechanical stress) could also play a role. To address this issue, tobacco Nicotiana tabacum plants were subjected to two levels of mechanical stress, 0 (control) or 40 (flexed) daily flexures, and grown solitarily, in a dense monostand (with plants of only one mechanical treatment), or in a mixed stand (flexed and control plants grown together). Flexed plants produced shorter and thicker stems with a lower Young's modulus than control plants, while dense-stand plants had relatively taller and thinner stems than solitary ones. Flexing effects on stem characteristics were independent of stand density. Growth, reproduction, and survival of solitary plants were not affected by flexing, while in the monostand growth was slightly reduced. But in the mixed stand, flexed plants were readily shaded by controls and had considerably lower growth, survival, and reproduction rates. These results suggest that wind shielding indeed {{plays a role in}} the <b>plastic</b> increase in <b>stem</b> elongation of plants in dense vegetation and that this response can have important consequences for competitive ability and lifetime seed production...|$|R

40|$|Designing a {{standardised}} {{sampling method}} for invertebrate monitoring: a pilot experiment in a motorway retention pond The {{implementation of the}} European Water Framework Directive revealed the necessity to develop new tools designed for freshwater ecosystems monitoring. As a new assessment approach employing invertebrate monitoring, three articial substra-tes (two benthic and one pelagic) were tested for 7, 14, 21 and 35 days of exposure in a motorway retention pond located in Southern France. Two of these articial substrates appeared to sample too narrow a range of taxa, which was conrmed by two-way ANOVA tests and diversity and evenness indices. Samples taken by the remaining articial substrate, composed of six <b>plastic</b> plant <b>stems</b> xed on a 15 × 15 cm square tile, were representative of the species assemblage found in the stormwa-ter retention ponds.

The transistor is the fundamental building block of all these applications. A key challenge in patterning transistors on flexible <b>plastic</b> substrates <b>stems</b> from the in-plane nonlinear deformations as a consequence of foil expansion/shrinkage, moisture uptake, baking etc. during various processing steps. Optical maskless lithography is one of the potential candidates for compensating for these foil distortions by in-situ adjustment prior to exposure of the new layer image with respect to the already patterned layers. Maskless lithography also brings the added value of reducing the cost-of-ownership related to traditional mask-based tools by eliminating the need for expensive masks. For the purpose of this paper, single-layer maskless exposures at 355 nm were performed on gold-coated poly(ethylenenaphthalate) (PEN) flexible substrates temporarily attached to rigid carriers to ensure dimensional stability during processing. Two positive photoresists were employed for this study and the results on plastic foils were benchmarked against maskless as well as mask-based (ASML PAS 5500 / 100 D stepper) exposures on silicon wafers. © 2009 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{orthopaedic}} {{research has}} focused upon the assessment of individual components in an implanted construct. A great deal of research has investigated the durability of the metallic stem, {{even though this is}} the most robust component in the implanted system. Standards have been developed for the structural assessment of the implant and even the bone cement which holds the implant in place in the bone. However, the construct as a whole, and its short- and long-term structural integrity, are rarely assessed, and few methods have been established to monitor and predict the mechanisms leading to failure. These are necessary to ensure that any new implants entering the market will perform satisfactorily and prevent premature revision surgery. The acoustic emission (AE) technique offers the capability of monitoring structural degradation passively and in real time, and can distinguish failure mechanisms and their location through the analysis of AE parameters. In the present paper, the use of acoustic emission in orthopaedics, in particular for the evaluation of hip replacement constructs, is reviewed. Following this, three case studies undertaken at the University of Southampton are presented, in which acoustic emission on-line monitoring has been used to evaluate the performance of simulated artificial hip replacement constructs and their constituents during static and fatigue testing. In Case Study 1, the fatigue behaviour of bone cement is characterized; in Case Study 2, the residual stresses induced in the construct as a result of bone cement cure are investigated; in Case Study 3, the mechanisms leading to failure of a carbon fibre reinforced <b>plastic</b> hip <b>stem</b> during fatigue testing are characterized...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundBone marrow–derived {{cells are}} {{recruited}} into the thrombus during resolution. This study explored whether mobilization of bone marrow cells with recombinant human {{granulocyte colony-stimulating factor}} (rhG-CSF) could enhance the resolution of venous thrombi and the accumulation of macrophages in thrombi and explored the effect of rhG-CSF on cysteine-cysteine chemokine receptor 2 (CCR 2) expression. MethodsThe Sprague-Dawley adult rats were randomly divided into four groups: control, sham-operated, thrombus, and treatment groups. Thrombi were induced in the thrombus and treatment group, which received a subcutaneous injection of rhG-CSF once daily for 6 days postoperatively. The thrombus, sham-operated, and control groups received equal volumes of 0. 9 % saline. The mononuclear cells in peripheral blood were analyzed by an automated hematology analyzer and counted under microscope. The cell marker CD 68 {{was used to determine}} the number of macrophages in thrombi tissue sections. Levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) and macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 α (MIP 1 α) in the peripheral blood were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were used to analyze, respectively, the expression of CCR 2 messenger RNA in the peripheral blood and CCR 2 protein of THP- 1 monocyte. ResultsAt postoperative days 3 (P <. 05) and 7 (P <. 01), mononuclear cells significantly increased in treatment group (2. 1 ± 0. 3, 4. 4 ± 0. 3 × 106 /L) vs the thrombus group (1. 7 ± 0. 2, 1. 3 ± 0. 4 × 106 /L). The organization and recanalization of thrombi in treatment group progressed more quickly compared with the thrombus group (P <. 01). The macrophage number of the thrombus in the treatment group (338 ± 26 cells/ 15 high-power fields) increased significantly vs the thrombus group (125 ± 11 cells/ 15 high-power fields, P <. 01). No statistical difference was observed between the thrombus and treatment group in the MCP- 1 and MIP- 1 α level in peripheral blood. Expressions of the CCR 2 gene in the peripheral blood of the treatment group significantly increased compared with the thrombus group (P <. 05). Recombinant human G-CSF induced higher expression of CCR 2 protein of human monocytic cell line THP- 1. ConclusionsBone marrow mobilization enhanced the resolution and recanalization of venous thrombi. This process was associated with increased macrophage accumulation in thrombi, which might be the result of higher CCR 2 expression of monocytes. Clinical RelevanceThe classic treatment of venous thrombi is anticoagulation. Anticoagulant therapy and thrombolysis both have limited effects on existing thrombi and have a small but significant risk of severe hemorrhage. In clinical practice, we lack specific treatment for patients with venous thrombosis combined with brain hemorrhage or a gastrointestinal activated ulcer, which are contraindicated for anticoagulation and thrombolytic therapy. Enhancing the resolution of venous thrombi would contribute to its therapy. Bone marrow–derived cells are recruited into the thrombus during resolution. Many of these cells express a macrophage phenotype and may represent a population of <b>plastic</b> <b>stem</b> cells that orchestrate thrombus recanalization. Recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) can mobilize monocytic lineage cells into peripheral blood and may contribute to this cell in the thrombi. If rhG-CSF enhances the resolution of venous thrombi and recanalization, it might be used to treat patients with venous thrombi, especially those who have contraindication for anticoagulation and thrombolytic therapy...|$|R
40|$|Peripheral nerve {{injury is}} a life-changing problem, which {{presents}} significant therapeutic challenges to clinicians and patients. A {{number of different}} approaches {{to dealing with the}} issue exist but to date there is no consensus on the most effective method of treatment. With large gap nerve transection or central to peripheral nervous system intersection injury, spontaneous meaningful axonal recovery seldom occurs. Despite surgical intervention with autografts, the functional outcomes are often unfavorable. Tissue engineered strategies utilising scaffolds which mimic the properties of nerve grafts, but which prevent the need for the secondary injury associated with harvesting autografts, are currently being investigated. Considerable interest has been given to the combined use of biologically active scaffolds with progenitor cells which function synergistically to enable functional tissue growth. Combining the purely surgical approach with contemporary developments in tissue engineering offers a challenging but potentially rewarding way forward. In this thesis, the possibilities and the challenges of a fusion between surgery and tissue engineering is examined. While much of the analysis is determined by the surgical background and training of the author, the outcome of the research points to potentially very exciting prospects for further joint research. This dual purpose, prospective in vitro and in vivo research project has critically evaluated the capacity of stem cells derived from the olfactory neuroepithelium (ONS cells) to act with a purpose designed collagen-hyaluronic acid based biological nerve guidance conduit, as an efficient graft material in the repair of surgically ablated peripheral nerve tissue. The approach incorporated (i) an evaluation of the effect of biomaterials and growth factors on the neurogenic and gliogenic capacity of ONS cells, (ii) an evaluation of the in vitro behavior of ONS cells cultured within a purpose designed collagen-hyaluronic acid biological nerve guidance conduit, and (iii) an in vivo evaluation of the capacity of ONS cells combined with the nerve guidance conduit to mediate functional healing following critical defect injury in a rat sciatic nerve model. The two-dimensional in vitro analysis described in Chapter 2, demonstrated that multipotent highly <b>plastic</b> <b>stem</b> cells with the potential to differentiate along neural and glial lineage could be harvested from explants taken from the rat nasal cavity. Interestingly, ONS cells derived from young donor animals were found to have increased multipotentiality in comparison to ONS cells derived from older animals. In addition, the work demonstrated that ONS cells proliferation and differentiation potential is dependent on biomaterials to varying degrees. Nerve growth factor was also found to have similar effects to biomaterials on the differentiation capacity of ONS cells. The three-dimensional in vitro analysis described in Chapter 3 demonstrated that an ergonomic and robust biphasic nerve guidance conduit, produced by the combination of a tubular collagen conduit with a biologically active, laminin functionalised hyaluronic acid hydrogel luminal filler, supported ONS cell viability and differentiation whilst the addition of nerve growth factor promoted both differentiation and morphological extension of ONS cells. The in vivo study described in Chapter 4 demonstrated that the biphasic nerve guidance conduit promoted anisotropic peripheral nerve regeneration following critical sciatic nerve injury, and that functional and morphological repair was enhanced with the addition of ONS cells. Moreover the addition of nerve growth factor was found to mediate functional healing. Collectively, this thesis points {{to the development of a}} novel biomimetic biphasic nerve guidance conduit with an optimised composition and suitable mechanical properties with which to deliver multipotent ONS cells for use in peripheral nerve defects. This research work highlights the importance of biomaterials and growth factor selection in the design of cell specific delivery systems for peripheral nerve regeneration with potential for use in future clinical trials...|$|R

Chromatin within stem cells is dynamic and relaxed, allowing transcription and thus lineage specification to occur rapidly. To determine how this property {{can be used}} to enhance the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), I examined whether the expression of histone variants or peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (Ppiases) could increase the hyperdynamic, <b>plastic</b> nature of <b>stem</b> cell chromatin and thereby increase the efficiency and speed of reprogramming. I used molecular cloning to generate expression vectors containing the histone variants H 3 T and H 2 A. B. I used line-scanning microscopy to measure chromatin dynamics, with initial results suggesting that stem cells are more hyperdynamic in nature than differentiated cells. Although the research on the effect of histone variants and Ppiases on chromatin dynamics and reprogramming was not completed, another study showed that the expression of other histone variants does enhance reprogramming and may also induce an open chromatin structure. If this holds true for the histone variants studied here or Ppiase B (PpiB), this could further enhance the generation of iPSC and make future autologous engraftments of iPSC more feasible...|$|R

'Accent Deep Pink' with plants grown under a control polythene film (standard UVI/EVA film). Half of the plants under the control film were treated with a chemical plant growth regulator (PGR; diaminozide, B-Nine) and half were sprayed with water alone. Possible negative effects of such film plastics on flowering, and on fresh and dry weight accumulation, were also quantified. Plants were harvested destructively when all plants in each treatment had reached the first open flower stage. In Petunia, plant height was reduced by all three FR-filtering films and by PGR-treatment. The FR-filtering films giving the highest R:FR ratios also reduced plant height in Impatiens. Leaf number, leaf area and total dry Weight in both species. were greatest in the controls and smallest under films with the lowest PAR transmission.

40|$|Cellular {{plasticity}} {{refers to}} the ability of a cell to change its fate or identity in response to external or intrinsic factors. Regeneration of the intestinal epithelium after injury is driven mainly by plasticity of crypt stem cells that can rapidly divide to replace all the lost cells. Stem cell plasticity also occurs in cancer where mutations transform them into cancer stem cells that drive tumor formation. Emerging evidence suggests that non-stem cells also play a role in regeneration and cancer. This thesis research describes the generation of novel mouse models, the Alpi-CreER model, to examine the plasticity of enterocytes in small intestine regeneration and cancer, and the Car 1 -CreER model, to study tumor formation from differentiated cells in the colon. Results from experiments with the Alpi-CreER mouse shows that after intestinal damage enterocytes progenitors are <b>plastic,</b> behaving like <b>stem</b> cells that can replace lost Lgr 5 + stem cells both in mice or in cultured organoids in the lab. Enterocytes with mutations of both Apc and K-ras genes form tumors in organoid culture but do not form tumors in mice. Interestingly, Apc/-K-ras mutated tumors form tumors in mice when they gain access to the stem cell microenvironment. Experiments with the Car 1 -CreER model showed that Apc/K-ras mutations in differentiated epithelial cells leads to tumor formation in the colon. These results suggest that stem cell identity in crypts is not fixed; rather the stem cell microenvironment can change the fate of crypt cells including enterocyte progenitors to become stem cells.

40|$|This study {{presents}} mesoFON, an individual-based mangrove forest dynamics {{model that}} advances beyond current models by describing crown plasticity of mangrove trees. The crown plasticity routines {{take advantage of}} the fields-of-neighborhood (FON) approach and account for the trunk bending and the differential side branch growth mechanism. Competition for above-/below-ground resources is dealt with separately in this model. Offspring production depends on tree growth and rises with tree ontogeny. An extensive sensitivity analysis revealed that mesoFON resembles the behavior of known mangrove forest dynamics and is ready for application. In this study we exposed two plant functional types (PFTs) of the red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle L.) either in monoculture or as a community to two disturbance regimes, namely (1) without disturbances and (2) with hurricane impacts returning every 5 years. While one functional type possesses plastic crowns, the other PFT has rigid crowns. For the first time, long-term interaction of lateral crown displacement and disturbance was examined using a comprehensive comparative analysis including point patterns and canopy coverage. In the monoculture experiments disturbance strongly promoted the beneficial effects of crown plasticity. Without disturbance crown movements merely increased stand-based stem volume by 6. 7 % despite considerable displacement distances. We attribute this to the overall high competitive strength that constrained the effects of plasticity in the dense stands. Yet, in disturbed stands the <b>plastic</b> behavior raised <b>stem</b> volume and tree density by 12. 5 % and 7. 5 %, respectively, as a result of substantially reduced local competition (by 20. 1 %). In this treatment crown shifts are particularly advantageous because of their contribution to gap closure. Generally, the Clark Evans aggregation index of crown centers tended to be higher than that of stem bases indicating a more regular distribution of crown centers. The same was true for the canopy coverage of crowns located at their centers implying better space usage by shifted crowns. Pair-correlation functions revealed a plasticity-induced trend toward more regular distribution at low tree-to-tree distances and less aggregation at intermediate distances. The trend was stronger in disturbed communities. The plastic PFT was finally able to out-compete the rigid PFT in all community experiments. Hurricane impacts, however, accelerated the time to the extinction of the rigid PFT by a factor of 2. 4. © 2014 Elsevier B. V. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{is the first}} deliverable of PLASTIC Work Package 4 (WP 4) : Service Validation Methodology and Tools. It provides the high-level specifications of the "Test framework specification and architecture" aimed at validating the PLASTIC applications. Generally speaking, the validation of B 3 G applications requires novel advanced technologies to face the high complexity of the systems considered, in terms of distribution, mobility, heterogeneity, dynamism, context-awareness, and the stringent requirements for quality of service and dependability. Given the blend of functional and extra-functional properties {{that need to be}} validated, in WP 4 we aim at a holistic approach which includes analytical and empirical techniques to be employed both during development and at runtime. The framework has been organized around three main stages that we have identified as suitable for the validation of B 3 G services. A first main distinction concerns whether the services are tested in a fake/simulated environment before deployment, or rather after deployment, by validating their behaviour while they execute in the real environment. We name the two kinds of testing as off-line and on-line, respectively, and we claim that the validation of <b>PLASTIC</b> applications should <b>stem</b> from a suitable combination of both these kinds of testing. In particular, in addition to off-line testing, we adopt on-line testing because the high run-time dynamism of service-based systems makes it impossible to foresee all possible contexts in which the services will be used. Both off-line and on-line validation should consider the functional properties and the extra-functional properties. With regard to off-line validation, we propose advanced techniques such as simulation-based testing and model-based testing on symbolic state machine, and introduce support for distributed experimentation and automated test harness generation. In relation to on-line validation, we introduce a further distinction between i) on-line testing before publication, by which a service undergoes a sort of qualification exam, called Audition, before it can be "officially" recognized as having adequate quality for being included in the PLASTIC environment, and ii) monitoring of the service behaviour during real usage, in which case we provide for an aspect-oriented approach to monitoring service compositions, {{as well as for the}} verification that the contractually agreed extra-functional specifications are fulfilled. As a result of the rich variety of challenges, in WP 4 we introduce a set of technologies. The proposed techniques used altogether provide a powerful multilateral approach to the validation of B 3 G applications. As their usage however requires some effort and implies the provision of adequate basic technology, they have been conceived so that each can be used independently from the others, and also they can be variously combined to obtain a more comprehensive approach. An integrated overview of the resulting architecture, in terms of a unified process, is given in the concluding part of this document...|$|R
