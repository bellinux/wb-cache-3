(December 11, 1847 - January 9, 1925)Except for one year in Atlanta, John Higgins was schooled in Worcester. He was poor in {{spelling}} and languages but shared his father's natural talent and interest in mathematics and mechanics. He also possessed a fascination with metalworking and spent many hours observing blacksmiths, farmers and factory workers at work. Like many of his contemporaries, he was also enchanted by the chivalric tales of knights, a common literary theme at the time. After graduating from Worcester Polytechnic Institute he joined the <b>Plunger</b> <b>Elevator</b> Company with his father. When the company was sold, the two men purchased the Worcester Ferrule and Manufacturing Company, reorganizing it in 1905 as Worcester Pressed Steel Company. When his father died in 1912, John Higgins became president and treasurer, positions he held until 1949 when his oldest son took over.|$|E
