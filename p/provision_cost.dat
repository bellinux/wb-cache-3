40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{mechanism}} that a profit-making principal should adopt {{to provide a}} discrete public good when {{the values of the}} consumers are their private information and their participation is voluntary. The free-riding issue is resolved through threatened nonprovision of the good by the provider. Every bidder is asked to announce his or her virtual value as defined in Myerson (1981). The public good is provided if and only if the sum of the bidders' announced virtual values exceeds the <b>provision</b> <b>cost.</b> When a provision decision results, each bidder pays an amount that is determined by the announcement of other consumers. No one pays when a nonprovision decision results. We find that this mechanism is implementable through an all-pay auction. A restricted profit-maximizing mechanism that implements efficient allocation is also characterized. As in Gradstein (1994), when provision is always efficient, that is, the sum of consumers' values always exceeds the <b>provision</b> <b>cost,</b> efficient allocation is achievable through a profit-maximizer.

In the forwarding service, requests of end users from different regions arrive in real-time to gain live video streams of IP cameras from inter-connected video data centers. A fundamental scheduling problem is how to assign resources with the global optimal resource cost and forwarding delay to forward live video streams. We introduce the resource <b>provisioning</b> <b>cost</b> as the combination of media server cost, connection bandwidth cost, and forwarding delay cost. In this paper, a multi-objective resource provisioning (MORP) approach is proposed {{to deal with the}} online inter-datacenter resource provisioning problem. The approach aims at minimizing the resource <b>provisioning</b> <b>cost</b> during live video forwarding. It adaptively allocates media servers in appropriate video data centers and connects the chosen media servers together to provide system scalability and connectivity.

40|$|For {{at least}} fifty years economists have argued that vertically-aggregated {{marginal}} willingness to pay, when set equal to marginal <b>provision</b> <b>cost,</b> will result in optimal public good provision levels. This methodological approach {{would be expected to}} yield an exact analog, in terms of optimal levels of public good provision, to efficient provision of private goods in a perfect market setting. There is, however, a potentially serious flaw in the approach as actually practiced, since initial incomes are implicitlyand wronglytaken to be optimal. From a given income, the output demand revelation problem has long been recognizedthat there will be difficulty inferring true demands for public goods at that income (the traditional `free rider' problem). But what has failed to receive widespread recognition among theoreticians, and especially among practitioners, is that there will also be a concomitant `input demand revelation' problem. In any situation where workers cannot individually increment a class of goods by increasing their income (e. g. public goods), they will have no incentive to generate the income that would have been devoted to that class of goods. They will only generate income that is optimal to pay the higher taxes or prices associated with whatever initial public goods levels are provided. As a consequence, the benefit-cost practitioner will, even if somehow able to accurately guess marginal willingness-to-pay out of current income, observe only one apparent optima. There are an infinite number of such optima, one for each level of free riding in input markets, where aggregated marginal willingness-to-pay will appear to equal marginal <b>provision</b> <b>cost.</b> The one true Samuelson `optimum optimorum' occurs when there is free riding in neither output nor input markets (that is, when the `full' demand revelation problem is solved). As a consequence, pure public goods, as well as other `non-incrementable' goods and goods for which non-use values are of importance will be undervalued, hence under-provided. Evidence is presented that the problem raised here might be of importance, undermining the practical significance of the Coase theorem vis-à-vis Pigouvian taxation. ...|$|E

40|$|Pricing water {{properly}} is {{a common}} rubric for water scarcity problems. The problem is to determine what constitutes a proper price. One foundation is pricing based on trade in a market. However, development of markets for water has been limited by issues of property rights and externalities. An alternative paradigm for pricing that may prove more available is pricing water to cover its <b>provision</b> <b>cost.</b> To develop pricing rules, this paper frames water provision as a local collective action problem: a group of water users in a given geographic area seeks to determine water supply and pricing to maximize net benefits of water use subject to cost recovery. Here, the method of pricing is combined with issues of economic organization and privatization. The proposed economic organization is co-management by private and public water agencies to achieve efficiency and cost recovery. The approach extends to cost recovery with conservation concerns and also to cost recovery with service quality aspects. Pricing parameters that cover costs can be directly determined when demand and cost functions are known.

40|$|In {{deregulated}} electricity markets, {{reactive power}} provision {{is one of}} the most important ancillary services which is vital for reliable and secure operation of the system. In all electricity markets, economic issues play an important role in market scheduling. This paper presents an algorithm to find optimal reactive power market schedule. The proposed algorithm seeks to minimize a novel three-component payment function which precisely considers economic issues in the market. Two first parts of this function are reactive power <b>provision</b> <b>cost</b> and transmission loss payment. Moreover, another important part of this payment function, which has not considered in the time of reactive power market clearing in literature, is transmission charge payment. As it is shown in simulation results, this term of the function can importantly impact on final reactive power market schedule and consequently on total market payment and final market schedule. Furthermore, due to significant impact of reactive power on system voltage stability, the algorithm tries to schedule reactive power market with an adequate voltage security margin.
