5|$|Aside {{from the}} <b>prosperity</b> <b>and</b> {{modernization}} PedroII {{left to the}} nation, {{there was also a}} heritage of political and personal values. Many of his reforms and achievements had become {{so much a part of}} the national consciousness that they were accommodated by successor regimes. These formed the foundation for Brazilian democratic ideals. Historians have also largely agreed that PedroII's reign was not merely benign, but rather, exceptionally constructive and progressive. He has also consistently been ranked by scholars as the greatest Brazilian.|$|E
5|$|Between 1386 and 1572, the Polish-Lithuanian {{union was}} {{ruled by a}} {{succession}} of constitutional monarchs of the Jagiellonian dynasty. The political influence of the Jagiellonian kings gradually diminished during this period, while the landed nobility took over an ever-increasing role in central government and national affairs. The royal dynasty, however, had a stabilizing effect on Poland's politics. The Jagiellonian Era is often regarded as a period of maximum political power, great <b>prosperity,</b> <b>and</b> in its later stage, a Golden Age of Polish culture.|$|E

Byzantine art and literature held a pre-eminent place in Europe, and the cultural impact of Byzantine art on the west during this period was enormous and of long lasting significance.|$|E
5|$|Pedro II may be {{considered}} a rare instance of a head of state who, despite being overwhelmingly beloved by his people, despite international admiration and acclamation, despite having been instrumental in driving forward major liberal social and economic reforms, despite overseeing a period of outstanding <b>prosperity</b> <b>and</b> influence during a reign covering nearly six decades, and despite being considered a highly successful ruler to the end, was ultimately subjected to overthrow and exile.

Moreover, Sviatoslav's campaigns led to increased Slavic settlement in the region of the Saltovo-Mayaki culture, greatly changing the demographics and culture of the transitional area between the forest and the steppe.|$|E

5|$|The Han dynasty (206 BC– 220 AD) {{of ancient}} China {{experienced}} contrasting periods of economic <b>prosperity</b> <b>and</b> decline. It is normally {{divided into three}} periods: Western Han (206 BC– 9 AD), the Xin dynasty (9–23 AD), and Eastern Han (25–220 AD). The Xin regime, established by the former regent Wang Mang, formed a brief interregnum between lengthy periods of Han rule. Following the fall of Wang Mang, the Han capital was moved eastward from Chang'an to Luoyang. In consequence, historians have named the succeeding eras Western Han and Eastern Han respectively.|$|E
