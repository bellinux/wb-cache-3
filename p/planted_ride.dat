2500|$|To produce Atlas Shrugged, Rand {{conducted}} {{research on the}} American railroad industry. Her previous work on a proposed (but never realized) screenplay based {{on the development of}} the atomic bomb, including her interviews of J. Robert Oppenheimer, was used in the portrait of the character Robert Stadler and the novel's depiction of the development of [...] "Project X". To do further background research, Rand toured and inspected a number of industrial facilities, such as the Kaiser Steel <b>plant,</b> <b>rode</b> the locomotives of the New York Central Railroad, and even learned to operate the locomotive of the Twentieth Century Limited (and proudly reported that when operating it, [...] "nobody touched a lever except me").|$|R

50|$|Stinson {{became a}} school trustee {{in the early}} 1950s and soon {{afterwards}} was appointed chairman of the North York board of education. In the 1957 federal election, {{at the age of}} 34, he ran for federal office in the riding of York Centre for the Progressive Conservative Party, defeating the incumbent, Al Hollingworth, by over 10,000 votes. He was re-elected in the 1958 federal election, but his lack of support for Prime Minister John Diefenbaker in the 1956 Tory leadership convention meant that he had little support from party leadership. In addition, the scuttling of the Avro Arrow project and the closure of the <b>plant</b> near his <b>riding</b> made him unpopular in his riding; he blamed the Arrow decision for his loss in the 1962 federal election to James Edgar Walker, a Liberal.|$|R

5000|$|Tuura {{tries to}} find out ways to stop the road {{construction}} and Uuno figures out an idea to make the mansion into a vacation resort. His in-laws and Elisabeth {{do a lot of}} repair and clean-up work to make the mansion into a vacation resort. Meanwhile, Uuno receives the first customer, who is Kreetta, a [...] "spy" [...] hired by Tuura. Because of a mistake, Kreetta follows Uuno's actions and not the real target given by Tuura. Uuno entertains Kreetta by riding a bicycle on the wheat fields, <b>planting</b> wheat, <b>riding</b> water-skis and going to the sauna. The Council of Traffic plans to move the road around Tuura's mansion. This suggestion is greatly opposed. The matter is put aside until a [...] "summer event" [...] organised by Uuno has been held, where Uuno's father secretly makes people drink moonshine. Uuno receives two million markka from Tuura to turn around the heads of the Council of Traffic. After a successful summer event, the Council of Traffic meets, to vote for the road to pass through Tuura's lands at the direction of the school teacher. The minister draws a line on the map. Tuura is disappointed about the issue, until Uuno's father arrives and is ready to buy the mansion. Tuura laughs, but Hugo has enough money for the mansion and so they go to sign a deed. Uuno arrives to tell that he held a ruler and his thumb so that the road made a bend around Tuura's mansion. Tuura goes to follow Uuno's father, who has gone to the farmhand's home.|$|R
50|$|Napier's 1902 win {{brought the}} Gordon Bennett hosting duties to the United Kingdom, and the 1903 event was held south of Dublin, with three shaft-driven Napiers {{defending}} the British and Irish honour, {{all in the}} (later famous) racing green: two 470 cubic inch (7708 cc) 45 horsepower (33.5 kW) fours for Charles Jarrott and J. W. Stocks, with McDonald, the Genoa <b>plant</b> manager, his <b>riding</b> mechanic, and an 80 horsepower (838 cubic inch, 13,726 cc), the Type K5, for Edge. Jarrott and Stocks crashed, and Edge was disqualified. It was a bad year for Napier's racing program; a 35 hp {{in the hands of}} Colonel Mark Mayhew in the Paris-Madrid rally lost its steering and hit a tree. Edge, again with McDonald, fared no better with the K5 in the 1904 Gordon Bennett in Germany, but a new 920 cubic inch (15-litre; 158.7×127 mm, 6.25×5 inch) six, the L48, with an external radiator reminiscent of the Cord 810, set the fastest time at the Velvet Strand speed trials at Portmarnock, Ireland, in September, piloted by McDonald.|$|R
40|$|Hunting foxes with hounds {{has been}} a {{countryside}} pursuit in Britain since the 17 th Century, but its effect nationally on habitat management is little understood by the general public. A survey questionnaire was distributed to 163 mounted fox hunts of England and Wales to quantify their management practices in woodland and other habitat. Ninety-two hunts (56 %), covering 75, 514 km(2), returned details on woodland management motivated by the improvement of their sport. The management details were verified via on-site visits for a sample of 200 woodlands. Following verification, the area of woodlands containing the management was conservatively estimated at 24, 053 (+/- 2241) ha, comprising 5. 9 % of woodland area within {{the whole of the}} area hunted by the 92 hunts. Management techniques included: tree <b>planting,</b> coppicing, felling, <b>ride</b> and perimeter management. A case study in five hunt countries in southern England examined, through the use of botanical survey and butterfly counts, the consequences of the hunt management on woodland ground flora and butterflies. Managed areas had, within the last 5 years, been coppiced and rides had been cleared. Vegetation cover in managed and unmanaged sites averaged 86 % and 64 %, respectively, and managed areas held on average 4 more plant species and a higher plant diversity than unmanaged areas (Shannon index of diversity: 2. 25 vs. 1. 95). Both the average number of butterfly species (2. 2 vs. 0. 3) and individuals counted (4. 6 vs. 0. 3) were higher in the managed than unmanaged sites...|$|R
5000|$|In the fresco cycle Lorenzetti {{expresses the}} idea that the cause of peace lays not only from the effects of good government, but also from the {{citizens}} acting in “accordance with the temporal and astral force that governs” them. [...] Lorenzetti expresses this idea in part with the border along the three frescos, which display medallions featuring the personifications of the planets as well as the seasons. [...] Above the mural depicting The Effects of Good Government, these medallions follow the natural order of the seasons and alignment of the planets. In The Effects of Good Government, Lorenzetti shows the citizens completing the different labors for each of these months. The labors belonging to spring and summer are very clear; “fishing and tending to the vines (March), cultivation of the soil and <b>planting</b> (April), <b>riding</b> (May), ploughing and stock rising (June), cereal harvesting (July), threshing (August), and hunting (September)”. The labors of winter and fall are also found, but they do not follow the normal conventions of the time for depicting these labors. With these depictions of the labors following with the seasons and planets, Lorenzetti creates {{the idea that}} peace is in part possible due to the citizens following in accordance to the planets and seasons. It is also hypothesized that with the depictions of citizens in different labors, Lorenzetti shows the allegorical manifestations of the children of the different planets. On analysis it is clear that Lorenzetti depicted the children that would help ensure peace, versus those that would be disruptive of it. This can be seen with the emphasis of mercantile activities which were believed to be Mercury’s children. For the children of Venus, Lorenzetti chose to show a bride, weavers, and dancers, instead of depicting her more carnal children. The children of Mars, which all depend on the use of weapons, are represented by knights and guards. Saturn’s children are represented by ploughmen, diggers and threshers, and excludes his other children, such as cripples. Jupiter’s children are represented as hunters. With Lorenzetti emphasizing the children who would ensure peace, he drove home the importance of following activities to foster peace and not disrupt it. With both the depiction of the monthly labors and the planets' children, Lorenzetti shows the importance of performing the appropriate tasks in accordance to nature to ensure peace. This point is made stronger by the fact that half the seasons and plants are shown depicted over the scene of war, reminding the viewer the faulty error of not acting in accordance.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the turn}} of the century, as West Point {{approached}} its centennial, it became apparent that the campus was in need of a facilities overhaul and was lacking a clear design plan and architectural style. A major competition was held to design a major renovation of the campus, to include building a new cadet barracks (North Barracks, since demolished), chapel (the Cadet Chapel), academic building (Bartlett Hall), post headquarters (Taylor Hall), bachelor's officer quarters (Lincoln Hall), riding hall (Thayer Hall), and hotel (later the Thayer Hotel). In addition to all the construction, the winning bid had to cost less than $5,000,000. [...] After a lengthy competition, the firm of Cram, Goodhue, & Furgeson (CGF) was selected to overhaul the academy's facilities. Nearly all of their works still stand, and their designs have influenced all other works in the cadet area since.The first buildings completed by CGF was the heating <b>plant</b> and <b>riding</b> hall, completed along the cliffs of the Hudson in 1909. The massive riding hall rises from the cliffs along the river {{to the level of the}} Plain. This structure served as the home of equestrian instruction until riding was removed from the curriculum during World War II. In 1958, the hall's interior was completely renovated and converted into an academic hall, renamed Thayer Hall in honor of Sylvanus Thayer. Now containing four interior floors and a large auditorium, it is considered the main academic hall on campus. In 1910, CGF completed construction of the new Headquarters building, later named Taylor Hall in honor of Maxwell Taylor. Hayes Gymnasium was also constructed by CGF and completed in 1910, replacing the Richard Morris Hunt-designed gymnasium that would be demolished to make way for the new mess hall in 1920. The [...] "crown jewel" [...] of CGF's project was unquestionably the new West Point Cadet Chapel, set high on the hillside above the cadet area, and completed in 1910. Upon completion of the Cadet Chapel, the Old Cadet Chapel was deconstructed and moved to the cemetery in 1911. The granite used for the construction of the Cadet Chapel was quarried from the hillside behind Hayes gymnasium, practically at the construction site. [...] In 1913, CGF completed Bartlett Hall as one of the main academic buildings. The dirt and debris from the construction of Bartlett Hall was used to fill in [...] "execution hollow", a large depression located on the Plain near Trophy Point. Two of CGF's buildings that have not stood the test of time were the North Barracks, which were later demolished to make way for the current MacArthur Barracks, and the cadet guardhouse, located in North Area and later demolished to make way for Scott Barracks.|$|R
