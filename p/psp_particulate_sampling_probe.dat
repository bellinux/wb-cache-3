40|$|Two {{aspects of}} {{continuous}} flow electrophoresis were studied: (1) {{the structure of}} the flow field in continuous flow devices; and (2) the electrokinetic properties of suspended particles relevant to electrophoretic separations. Mathematical models were developed to describe flow structure and stability, with particular emphasis on effects due to buoyancy. To describe the fractionation of an arbitrary <b>particulate</b> <b>sample</b> by continuous flow electrophoresis, a general mathematical model was constructed. In this model, chamber dimensions, field strength, buffer composition, and other design variables can be altered at will to study their effects on resolution and throughput. All these mathematical models were implemented on a digital computer and the codes are available for general use. Experimental and theoretical work with <b>particulate</b> <b>samples</b> <b>probed</b> how particle mobility is related to buffer composition. It was found that ions on the surface of small particles are mobile, contrary to the widely accepted view. This influences particle mobility and suspension conductivity.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> {{insertion}} on plasma excitation conditions in direct sample insertion-inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (DSI-ICP-AES) were investigated. Graphite <b>sample</b> <b>probes</b> {{in the form}} of a cup and a rod (with or without undercut) were used. Molybdenum rods were also used for comparison. A dark central channel is created in the plasma when a <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> is inserted. The diameter of the central channel correlates with the diameter of the <b>sample</b> <b>probe.</b> In addition, the plasma excitation conditions were monitored using repetitive laser sampling to introduce a steady flow of Zn or Fe particles into the ICP. Changes in the relative excitation temperature and electron number density of the plasma were deduced from the ratios of the emission intensities of Fe line pair and Zn line pair, respectively. The temperature and electron number density of the plasma decreased when a <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> was inserted. The degree of changes in the plasma conditions depends on the diameter of the <b>sample</b> <b>probes,</b> regardless of the form and material of the probe. The diameter of the <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> instead of its mass plays a significant role in perturbing the plasma excitation conditions. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|This {{document}} {{reports on}} a series of tests to determine whether the location of the air <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> in the Hot Fuels Examination Facility (HFEF) heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) exhaust duct meets the applicable regulatory criteria regarding the placement of an air <b>sampling</b> <b>probe.</b> Federal regulations require that a <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> be located in the exhaust stack according to the criteria of the ANSI/HPS N 13. 1 - 1999, Sampling and Monitoring Releases of Airborne Radioactive Substances from the Stacks and Ducts of Nuclear Facilities. These criteria address the capability of the <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> to extract a sample that is representative of the effluent stream. The tests conducted by PNNL during July 2010 on the HFEF system are described in this report. The <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> location is approximately 20 feet {{from the base of the}} stack. The stack base is in the second floor of the HFEF, and has a building ventilation stream (limited potential radioactive effluent) as well as a process stream (potential radioactive effluent, but HEPA-filtered) that feeds into it. The tests conducted on the duct indicate that the process stream is insufficiently mixed with the building ventilation stream. As a result, the air <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> location does not meet the criteria of the N 13. 1 - 1999 standard. The series of tests consists of various measurements taken over a grid of points in the duct cross section at the proposed sampling-probe location.

40|$|Cement kilns {{can be used}} to co-process fly ash from {{municipal}} solid waste incinerators. However, this might increase emission of organic pollutants like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Knowledge of PCB concentrations and homolog and congener patterns at different stages in this process could be used to assess the possibility of simultaneously controlling emissions of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and "dioxin-like" compounds. To date, emissions from cement kilns co-processing fly ash from {{municipal solid}} waste incinerators have not been analyzed for PCBs. In this study, stack gas and <b>particulate</b> <b>samples</b> from two cement kilns co-processing waste incinerator fly ash were analyzed for PCBs. The average total tri- to deca-chlorinated biphenyl (Sigma 3 - 10 PCB) concentration in the stack gas samples was 10. 15 ng m(- 3). The Sigma 3 - 10 PCB concentration ranges in <b>particulate</b> <b>samples</b> from different stages were 0. 83 - 41. 79 ng g(- 1) for cement kiln 1 and 0. 13 - 1. 69 ng g(- 1) for cement kiln 2. The Sigma 3 - 10 PCB concentrations were much higher in <b>particulate</b> <b>samples</b> from the suspension pre-heater boiler, humidifier tower, and kiln back-end bag filters than in <b>particulate</b> <b>samples</b> from other stages. For these three stages, PCBs contributed to 15 - 18 % of the total PCB, PCDD/F, and polychlorinated naphthalene toxic equivalents in stack gases and particulate matter. The PCB distributions were similar to those found in other studies for PCDD/Fs and polychlorinated naphthalenes, which suggest that {{it may be possible to}} simultaneously control emissions of multiple organic pollutants from cement kilns. Homolog patterns in the <b>particulate</b> <b>samples</b> were dominated by the pentachlorobiphenyls. CB- 105, CB- 118, and CB- 123 were the dominant dioxin-like PCB congeners that formed at the back-end of the cement kiln. A mass balance of PCBs in the cement kilns indicated that the total mass of PCBs in the stack gases and clinker was about half the mass of PCBs in the raw materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Considerable {{attention}} has been recently received {{on the impact of}} aircraft-produced aerosols upon the global climate. Sampling particles directly from jet engines has been performed by different research groups in the U. S. and Europe. However, a large variation has been observed among published data on the conversion efficiency and emission indexes of jet engines. The variation results surely from the differences in test engine types, engine operation conditions, and environmental conditions. The other factor that could result in the observed variation is the performance of <b>sampling</b> <b>probes</b> used. Unfortunately, it is often neglected in the jet engine community. Particle losses during the sampling, transport, and dilution processes are often not discussed/considered in literatures. To address this issue, we evaluated the performance of one <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> by challenging it with monodisperse particles. A significant performance difference was observed on the <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> evaluated under different temperature conditions. Thermophoretic effect, nonisokinetic sampling and turbulence loss contribute to the loss of particles in <b>sampling</b> <b>probes.</b> The results of this study show that particle loss can be dramatic if the <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> is not well designed.

25|$|How {{the sample}} and matrix is {{deposited}} {{on the surface}} of the <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> needs to be a consideration in sample preparation as well. The dried drop method is the simplest of deposition methods. The matrix and sample solution are mixed together and then a small drop of the mixture is placed on the <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> surface and allowed to dry, thus crystallizing. The sandwich method involves depositing a layer of matrix onto the surface of the probe and allowing it to dry. A drop of the sample followed by a drop of additional matrix is then applied to the layer of dried matrix and allowed to dry as well. Variations on the sandwich technique involve depositing the matrix on the surface and then depositing the sample directly on top of the matrix. A particularly useful method involves depositing the matrix solution {{on the surface of}} the <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> in a solvent that will evaporate very rapidly, thus forming a very thin fine layer of matrix. The sample solution is then placed on top of the matrix layer and allowed to evaporate slowly, thus integrating the sample into the top layer of matrix as the sample solution evaporates. An addition concern when depositing the sample {{on the surface of the}} probe is the solubility of the sample in the matrix. If the sample is insoluble in the matrix, additional methods must be employed. A method used in this case involves mechanical grinding and mixing of solid sample and solid matrix crystals. Once blended well, this powder can be deposited on the surface of the <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> in free powder form or as a pill. Another possible method is placing the sample on the surface of the probe and applying vaporized matrix to the <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> to allow the matrix to condense around the sample.|$|R
