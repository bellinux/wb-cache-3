40|$|The {{feasibility}} of producing stainless steel clad carbon steel tubing by a gas <b>pressure</b> <b>bonding</b> process was evaluated. Such a tube product could provide substantial chromium savings over monolithic stainless tubing {{in the event}} of a serious chromium shortage. The process consists of the initial assembly of three component tubesets from conventionally produced tubing, the formation of a strong metallurgical bond between the three components by gas <b>pressure</b> <b>bonding,</b> and conventional cold draw and anneal processing to final size. The quality of the tubes produced was excellent from the standpoint of bond strength, mechanical, and forming properties. The only significant quality problem encountered was carburization of the stainless clad by the carbon steel core which can be overcome by further refinement through at least three different approaches. The estimated cost of clad tubing produced by this process is greater than that for monolithic stainless tubing, but not so high as to make the process impractical as a chromium conservation method...|$|E

40|$|A 20 MW Lower Hybrid Current Drive system {{using an}} antenna {{based on the}} Passive Active Multijunction (PAM) concept is envisaged on ITER for steady state operation, {{including}} the current ramp-up phase. In the frame of an EFDA task, a conceptual design of such a system has been performed. This paper gives an insight of the mechanical analysis, modeling and design carried out on two elements of the antenna: the front face, and the RF windows which constitute the first tritium barrier. The front face of the antenna will have to withstand high heat and fast neutrons fluxes directly from the plasma. It will be actively cooled and present a beryllium coating upon ITER requirement. The main issues were to ensure a reasonable margin versus a maximum temperature fixed by safety concerns (650 °C for plasma facing beryllium), and to understand and assess resistance of the assembly while in operation. Analyses were conducted on some variants of this PAM. Manufacturing scenarios considering ITER requirements and involving various techniques (brazing, high isostatic <b>pressure</b> <b>bonding,</b> explosion bonding) were explored, and simulations over subsequent residual stresses were conducted.

Initially the elements were assembled into a stainless steel or Ti-Namel envelope which was evacuated and sealed prior to bonding.
