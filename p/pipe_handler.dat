The file server's kernel was also extended with a mating component that received the remote requests {{and handed them to}} a pool of kernel processes for service, though a standard handler could have been written to do this. (Later in its product lifecycle, ISC deployed standard SVR4-based Unix servers in place of the DNIX servers. These used X.25 STREAMS and a custom-written file server program. In spite of the less efficient structuring, the raw horsepower of the platforms used made for a much faster server. It is unfortunate that this file server program did not support all of the functionality of the native DNIX server. Tricky things, like named pipes, never worked at all. This was another justification for the named <b>pipe</b> <b>handler</b> process.) ...|$|E

The hope of upgrading 1 such turbines, {{over and above}} their currently estimated energy transfer efficiency of 95 %, depends on extracting additional energy from the intermolecular hydrogen bonds and somehow adding this energy to the gravitational energy stored in the water behind the dam. This seems a tall order, {{but it is not}} impossible. An early indication of bond energy liberation was the electrocution/shock of a steam <b>pipe</b> <b>handler.</b> The accident occurred around 1840 in the north of England, apparently at Cramlington Colliery. The unfortunate man, who held the nozzle in one hand and rested the other hand on a water pipe, formed a link between the charged nozzle and the ground. A loud arc discharge at the steam nozzle seemed to hav...|$|E
5000|$|From {{the colonial}} eras {{travelers}} often emphasized the backward, uneducated, uncouth, dirty or unhygienic, impoverished, and violent aspects of Southern life. A favorite theme especially regarding Appalachia and the Ozarks portrayed [...] "hicks" [...] isolated from modern culture as shiftless male hunters, violently feuding clans like the Hatfields and McCoys, degraded women smoking corncob <b>pipes,</b> religious snake <b>handlers,</b> and compulsive banjo players.|$|R
50|$|DMTCP (Distributed MultiThreaded Checkpointing) is a {{tool for}} transparently {{checkpointing}} the state of an arbitrary group of programs spread across many machines and connected by sockets. It does not modify the user's program or the operating system. Among the applications supported by DMTCP are Open MPI, Python, Perl, and many programming languages and shell scripting languages. With the use of TightVNC, it can also checkpoint and restart X Window applications, {{as long as they}} do not use extensions (e.g. no OpenGL or video). Among the Linux features supported by DMTCP are open file descriptors, <b>pipes,</b> sockets, signal <b>handlers,</b> process id and thread id virtualization (ensure old pids and tids continue to work upon restart), ptys, fifos, process group ids, session ids, terminal attributes, and mmap/mprotect (including mmap-based shared memory). DMTCP supports the OFED API for InfiniBand on an experimental basis.|$|R
40|$|The Nickel Cadmium Battery Expert System- 2 (NICBES 2) is a {{prototype}} diagnostic expert system for Nickel Cadmium Battery Health Management. NICBES 2 {{is intended to}} support evaluation {{of the performance of}} Hubble Space Telescope spacecraft batteries, and to alert personnel to possible malfunctions. To achieve this, NICBES 2 provides a reasoning system supported by appropriate battery domain knowledge. NICBES 2 oversees the status of the batteries by evaluating data gathered in orbit packets, and when the status so merits, raises an alarm and provides fault diagnosis as well as advice on the actions to be taken to remedy the particular alarm. In addition to diagnosis and advice, it provides status history of the batteries' health, and a graphical display capability to help in assimilation of the information by the operator. NICBES 2 is composed of three cooperating processes driven by a program written in SunOS C. A serial port process gathers incoming data from an RS- 232 connection and places it into a raw data <b>pipe.</b> The data <b>handler</b> processes read this information from the raw data pipe and perform statistical data reduction to generate a set of reduced data files per orbit. The expert system process starts the Quintus Prolog interpreter and the expert system and then uses the reduced data files for the generation of status and advice information. The expert system presents the user with an interface window composed of six subwindows: Battery Status, Advice Selection, Support, Battery Selection, Graphics, and Actions. The Battery status subwindow can provide a display of the current status of a battery. Similarly, advice on battery reconditioning, charging, and workload can be obtained from the Advice Selection subwindow. A display of trends for the last orbit and over a sequence of the last twelve orbits is available in the Graph subwindow. A WHY button is available to give the user an explanation of the rules that the expert system used in determining the current information. The Support subwindow contains an editor for altering the knowledge base. NICBES 2 is written in C-language and Quintus Prolog for Sun series computers running SunOS. It requires 8 Mb of RAM for execution. The Quintus ProWindows graphics system is required for graphical display, and a Postscript printer is required to print graphics. A DEC LSI- 11 is required to send telemetry via a RS- 232 connection. The program is available on a. 25 inch streaming magnetic tape cartridge in UNIX tar format. NICBES 2 was developed in 1989.
