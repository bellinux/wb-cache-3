5000|$|In {{the case}} of <b>phase</b> <b>interference</b> fading, the time {{distribution}} of the instantaneous field strength usually approximates a Rayleigh distribution when several signal components of equal amplitude are present.|$|E
50|$|Detectors {{are only}} able to {{directly}} measure the amplitude, not the phase. However, with the correct microscope parameters, the <b>phase</b> <b>interference</b> can be indirectly measured via the intensity in the image plane. Electrons interact very strongly with crystalline solids. As a result, the phase changes due to very small features, down to the atomic scale, can be recorded via HRTEM.|$|E
50|$|The total phase {{difference}} {{is derived from}} the sum of both the path difference and the initial {{phase difference}} (if the X-ray waves are generated from two or more different sources).

40|$|We have {{observed}} high-contrast matter wave interference between 30 Bose-Einstein condensates with uncorrelated <b>phases.</b> <b>Interference</b> patterns were observed after independent condensates were {{released from a}} one-dimensional optical lattice and allowed to expand and overlap.

50|$|Alvin Lucier (born May 14, 1931) is an American {{composer}} {{of experimental}} music and sound installations that explore acoustic phenomena and auditory perception. A long-time music professor at Wesleyan University, Lucier {{was a member}} of the influential Sonic Arts Union, which included Robert Ashley, David Behrman, and Gordon Mumma. Much of his work is influenced by science and explores the physical properties of sound itself: resonance of spaces, <b>phase</b> <b>interference</b> between closely tuned pitches, and the transmission of sound through physical media.|$|E
50|$|The {{boundary}} microphone {{can be used}} as a piano mic or on hockey {{boards for}} body check sound effects. It is also commonly used to record full room sound by being mounted on a wall. When used to record a soloist or small musical ensemble along with the room acoustics, a boundary microphone prevents <b>phase</b> <b>interference</b> between direct and reflected sound, resulting in a natural sound with a flatter frequency response than can be obtained with a stand-mounted microphone at the same distance (explanation below).|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} analysis and experimental measurements of broadband optical wavelength conversion by four-wave mixing in semiconductor traveling-wave amplifiers. In the theoretical analysis, we obtain an analytical expression for the conversion efficiency. In the experiments, both up and down-conversion efficiencies are measured {{as a function}} of wavelength shift for shifts up to 27 nm. The experimental data are well explained by the theoretical calculation. The observed higher conversion efficiency for wavelength down-conversion is believed to be caused by <b>phase</b> <b>interferences</b> that exist between various mechanisms contributing to the four-wave mixing process...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the interplay between}} long-range and direct photon-assisted transport in a triple quantum dot chain where local ac voltages are applied to the outer dots. We propose the phase {{difference between the two}} ac voltages as an external parameter, which can be easily tuned to manipulate the current characteristics. For gate voltages in phase opposition we find quantum destructive interferences analogous to the interferences in closed-loop undriven triple dots. As the voltages oscillate in <b>phase,</b> <b>interferences</b> between multiple paths give rise to dark states. Those totally cancel the current, and could be experimentally resolved.

50|$|Another {{method to}} create a {{directional}} boundary mic {{is to use a}} small-diameter (1 cm or less) directional mic capsule mounted on a boundary surface, with the axis of the microphone parallel with the surface. As shown on manufacturers' datasheets, the mic capsule retains its directionality (cardioid or supercardioid polar pattern) and prevents comb filtering by keeping <b>phase</b> <b>interference</b> above the audible range. Examples include the Crown PCC-160 introduced in January 1985, and the Shure SM-91, which is also commonly used inside a kick drum for sound reinforcement.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The point-{{particle}}-like Hamiltonian of a biaxial spin particle {{with external}} magnetic field along the hard axis is obtained {{in terms of the}} potential field description of spin systems with exact spin-coordinate correspondence.

40|$|Many models {{beyond the}} SM predict new {{particles}} {{and the possibility}} for (approximate) degeneracies. In case of nearby resonances, interference effects between several unstable BSM particles may be relevant. However, the interference term is neglected by the standard narrow-width approximation (NWA). We have developed {{an extension of the}} usual NWA which allows for a consistent treatment of the interference term between nearly mass-degenerate states, including higher-order corrections. Phenomenological consequences of interference effects between neutral MSSM Higgs bosons will be presented. The two heavier states are quasi degenerate in a wide part of the parameter space. Therefore, especially in the MSSM with CP-violating complex <b>phases,</b> <b>interference</b> effects can {{have a significant impact on}} the interpretation of searches for additional Higgs bosons...|$|R
