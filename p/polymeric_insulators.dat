Environmental and electrical stresses have got deteriorating effects on <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulators.</b> Thus, knowing about behaviour {{of these types of}} insulators under various stresses is necessary. Till now, various electrical tests have been performed on <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulators</b> to investigate their performance in different situations and to provide a solution for predicting their effective lifetime. Also some standards for testing <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulators</b> have been proposed e. g. IEC 62217. In this paper, three pairs of similar 63 kV and three pairs of similar 132 kV <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulators</b> have been selected for studying the relation between leakage current of <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulators</b> and their specific creepage distance based on IEC 62217 standard. The specimens have been tested in three different creepage distances which are proportion of overall creepage distance. The Fast Fourier Transform analysis has been used to find the harmonic spectrum of the leakage current. The results showed that the amplitude of harmonic components for 63 kV insulators in all three cases is mostly equal to each other and similarly for 132 kV insulators...|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{insulators}} made {{of glass}} and porcelain (ceramic insulators) used in power transmission and distribution systems ruled the market till the introduction of <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulators</b> which have potential to replace the ceramic insulators because of lightweight, aesthetic, hydrophobic properties, and superior anti-contamination performance. However, the field experience of <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulators</b> is relatively short which demands that further studies {{on the performance of}} these insulators under actual and simulated environmental conditions be carried out before their full scale application on real power systems. This study contains the pioneer work carried out on <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulators</b> in Pakistan. The prime objective of this investigation is to determine how feasible <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulators</b> are for use in Pakistani environment so as to offer suitable recommendation to the national electric utility company (WAPDA) about the possible use of <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulators</b> on real system. Towards that end, <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulators</b> were exposed to lab and field aging representing Pakistani environmental conditions. The laboratory study addressed aging under environmental parameters individually as well as collectively. Moreover, weather cycles, simulating Pakistani conditions were designed and corresponding aging performance was investigated. The environmental stresses used in the study included UV radiation, temperature, electric stress, low pressure and humidity. For field aging the samples were installed at two typical locations representing a clean environment as well as a heavily polluted industrial area of Hatta Industrial Estate. The aged samples were periodically analyzed using advance techniques such as FTIR and SEM. Hydrophobicity characteristics were also studied and samples were critically checked for any obvious surface degradation. The investigation revealed that the <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulators</b> follow a periodic degradation and self-restoration cycle and no irreversible degradation such as tracking or erosion was observed. In multi-stress aging, the samples were exposed to accelerated aging to represent an actual exposure of 12. 67 years in the field. The insulators retained their characteristics throughout this period. Based on very promising I results of this pioneering investigation which simulated environmental conditions prevalent in Pakistan, it appears that <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulators</b> made of silicone rubber have 1 bright future for application on real transmission and distribution systems of Pakistan W APDA.

40|$|Pollution {{flashover}} {{constitutes the}} predominant parameter for the design,specification and dimensioning of high voltage outdoor insulation [1 - 2]. For {{over a quarter}} of a century, <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulators</b> have been used for overhead lines and substations due to their enhanced performance in highly polluted environments. This is mainly attributed to the hydrophobic properties of polymeric surfaces thatlead to a reduction of surface wetting and, thus, to a reduction of leakage current and discharge activity that could result to a flashover. However, under severe ambient conditions, discharge activity is not totally eliminated. The present investigations have demonstrated the development of dry bands and partial arcs on <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulators</b> (Chapter 3). While ‘cap and pin’ ceramic insulators - e. g. porcelain and glass - employ special anti-fog designs of increased leakage path introduced by the presence of deeper ribs, such profiles cannot be used for <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulators</b> due to moulding restrictions [1 - 1]. Yet, these moulding properties allow the fine texturing of the polymeric surface [1 - 7]. Textured insulators are a novel approach for the improvement of <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulators</b> using a surface design consisting of an array of hemispherical protuberances of various configurations and range of diameters. The objective is to reduce power dissipation (P = EJ) on the insulator surface by reducing the electric field gradient E and current density J (Chapter 2). Moreover, an increase of the longitudinal creepage path can be achieved without the need of increasing the overall length of the insulator. Where discharges do occur, the formation of parallel current paths could lead to less harmful discharges hence mitigating damage due to thermal stresses. An initial theoretical classification of the textured designs resulted to a shortlist of textured patterns that could be employed {{for the development of a}} full insulator prototype. At the next stage, these patterns were experimentally evaluated in a series of material tests in accordance to IEC- 60587 inclined-plane test procedure [Chapter 5]. Rectangular silicone rubber samples with a plane surface were tested along with samples with a textured finish to assess the performance against erosion and tracking. The improvement introduced by these textured patterns in comparison with conventional non-textured samples was outstanding [2 - 48, 49]. The intersecting square pattern showed the best performance, hence it was chosen for the development of a full textured insulator. Conventional 11 kV silicone rubber insulators and textured insulators with the same shed profile were cast in-house using vacuum injection casting techniques. There are no international standards for the artificial testing of <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulators.</b> In this work, a proposed test procedure for non-ceramic insulators is described (Chapter 3).

40|$|There {{are many}} HVDC schemes {{around the world}} {{operating}} at various voltage levels ranging from ± 200 kV to ± 800 kV dc. The choice of insulator types and level of insulation varies with voltage levels and environmental conditions through which the substations and transmission lines traverse. As in the case for ac lines, <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulators</b> were introduced on dc lines {{with a view to}} improved pollution performance and reduction of damage from vandalism. Another possible reason is that, generally, the price for a full dc glass string is higher than that of a similar voltage polymeric insulator unit. <b>Polymeric</b> <b>insulators,</b> comprising of silicone rubber (SiR) material filled with alumina trihydrate (ATH), have the ability of maintaining and transferring their hydrophobic property to the pollution layer that may collect on the surface, which gives them their superior pollution performance. A concern regarding the use of <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulators</b> is the ageing of the SiR material, which when stressed under certain ambient conditions may temporarily lose its hydrophobic property. During this period local discharge activity (corona discharges or surface leakage current flow) may lead to tracking on the surface and even erosion of the material. With sustained activity this may eventually lead to permanent degradation of the material and allow moisture ingress to the fiber glass core of the insulator. The combination of moisture ingress and the high electric fields may ultimately lead to failure of the insulator by mechanisms such as brittle fracture, flash-under, etc. as seen in various cases reported on ac lines. The performance, and in particular the ageing of <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulators</b> under HVDC stress, is an area that has not been researched as extensively as for HVAC stress. Factors such as pollution catch and accumulation, material composition, space charge effects and line polarity have yet to be explicitly evaluated. This research focuses on the accelerated ageing of silicon rubber when subjected to dc stress, taking polarity into account. The results of inclined plane tests, as per IEC 60587 : 2007, and the materials analyses on the silicone rubber are presented. The tests indicate that by using the standard ac guidelines, samples subjected to equivalent dc stress fail quicker than ac samples.

Commonly used suspension type of composite EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) insulator was subjected to accelerated stress aging as per modified IEC standard simulating the inland arid desert’s atmospheric condition and also as per IEC- 61109 standard. The hydrophobic characteristics were studied by measuring the contact angle along the insulator surface before and after the accelerated aging of the samples. It was found that EPDM insulator loses it hydrophobic properties proportional to the intensity of UV irradiations and its rate of recovery is also very low as compared to Silicone Rubber insulator.

40|$|An {{approach}} to high field control, {{particularly in the}} areas near the high voltage (HV) and ground terminals of an outdoor insulator, is proposed using a nonlinear grading material; Zinc Oxide (ZnO) microvaristors compounded with other polymeric materials to obtain the required properties and allow easy application. The electrical properties of the microvaristor compounds are characterised by a nonlinear field-dependent conductivity. This paper describes {{the principles of the}} proposed field-control solution and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in controlling the electric field along insulator profiles. A case study is carried out for a typical 11 kV <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulator</b> design to highlight the merits of the grading approach. Analysis of electric potential and field distributions on the insulator surface is described under dry clean and uniformly contaminated surface conditions for both standard and microvaristor-graded insulators. The grading and optimisation principles to allow better performance are investigated to improve the performance of the insulator both under steady state operation and under surge conditions. Furthermore, the dissipated power and associated heat are derived to examine surface heating and losses in the grading regions and for the complete insulator. Preliminary tests on in-house prototype insulators have confirmed better flashover performance of the proposed graded insulator with a 21 % increase in flashover voltage...|$|R
40|$|Electric field {{strength}} and leakage current density in the shank region of a polluted <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulator</b> may cause local dry-banding, with {{a risk of}} long-term degradation from partial-arc discharges. In a novel approach to dry-band control, the characteristics of silicone rubber surfaces with a textured finish are investigated and, depending on the geometry chosen for the texture, two useful objectives can be achieved. First, the increase of surface area can both reduce the leakage current density in the vulnerable shank region, and also increase the longitudinal creepage distance. Secondly, the damage arising from surface discharges can be mitigated. The principles of the proposed anti-fog design are described in detail. While complete prototype insulators are now being specified for fabrication, this paper reports preliminary results from tests using rectangular samples, which show an improvement in performance. The tests are of two kinds: a) inclined-plane, to assess erosion and tracking on rectangular samples of insulation materials. Such samples have been prepared both with a conventional plane surface and with a textured surface for comparative tests; b) clean-fog tests that use an initially dry pollution layer of known salinity. Here, plane and textured samples {{have been used for}} comparative tests, where leakage current and discharge activity are monitored during the generation of the fog...|$|R
40|$|Field grading {{material}} based microvaristors {{are widely used}} to minimise the localised field enhancement which could trigger corona and partial discharges in high voltage equipment. In this research, two different microvaristor powders, A and B are composed of silicone rubber matrix at certain filler concentration. The fabrication process of this composite is done by mixing the insulating matrix with filler using high shear mixer, follow by degassing and curing. The additional procedure, heat treatment, is introduced to avoid the agglomeration risk. Such challenges during running this process are well discussed. The composites are subjected to three high voltage tests, alternating current (AC), direct current (DC) and impulse. The non-linearity behaviour of these composite is characterised as dependent on the microvaristor loading, material properties and voltage application. The microscopic evaluations are conducted to {{examine the effect of}} material properties toward the electrical properties of composites. An 11 kV <b>polymeric</b> <b>insulator</b> has been modelled and simulated in COMSOL® platform. The performance of this insulator is assessed under a number of simulation scenarios. The potential voltage and field profile of this insulator are identified. Such improvement of field distribution along the insulator is required, therefore the electrical properties of field {{grading material}} is adopted into numerical simulation. The introduction of microvaristor material with an appropriate switching characteristic has led to a substantial improvement in the electric field and heat distributions along the insulator profile...|$|R
