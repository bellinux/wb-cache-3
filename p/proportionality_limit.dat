40|$|Cases are won {{and lost}} in {{discovery}}, yet discovery draws little academic attention. Most scholarship focuses on how much discovery to allow, not on how courts decide discovery disputes [...] which, unlike trials, occur in most cases. The growth of computer data [...] e-mails, lingering deleted files, and so forth [...] increased discovery cost, but the new e-discovery rules just reiterate existing cost-benefit <b>proportionality</b> <b>limits</b> that draw broad consensus among litigation scholars and economists. But proportionality rules are impossible to apply effectively; they fail to curb discovery excess yet disallow discovery that meritorious cases need. This Article notes proportionality 2 ̆ 7 s flaws but rejects the consensus blaming bad rulemaking or judging. Rather, proportionality requires impossible comparisons between discovery value and cost before parties gather the evidence. Like other arguments that procedural rulings should depend on case merits, this Article notes how discovery has more probative value in close cases [...] yet a case 2 ̆ 7 s merits are unclear during discovery because the court cannot yet examine all the evidence. In game theory terms, parties with discovery disputes cannot convey case merit credibly; courts have too little information, so low-merit parties can claim high merit, and courts are compelled {{to act as if}} all cases of a similar type warrant similar discovery. In this 2 ̆ 2 pooling equilibrium, 2 ̆ 2 ruling the same on all cases in the 2 ̆ 2 pool, 2 ̆ 2 regardless of merit, is courts 2 ̆ 7 best strategy but a suboptimal one, yielding too much discovery in low-merit cases, too little in higher-merit ones. Thus, the quest for better discovery has disappointed not because of bad rules or decisions, but because courts and parties are stuck in a pooling equilibrium with information-timing circularity: optimal evidence gathering requires merits analysis, which in turn requires evidence gathering. As a solution, courts could defer close decisions on possibly useful but costly evidence until meritorious cases separate from the pool, turning pooling into separating equilibria. Summary judgment can be this separation: cases going to trial after summary judgment not only have higher average merit than the pool of all filed cases, but are disproportionately likely to be the sort of close calls in which juries struggle to reach verdicts. No one yet has proposed post-summary judgment discovery to redress the costly discovery dilemma because summary judgment typically occurs only after all discovery, but high-cost evidence can be an exception to that usual sequence: cases surviving summary judgment are close calls warranting more fact gathering, so some costly discovery regularly denied should be allowed after summary judgment. Thus, the existing debate is too focused on limiting the amount of discovery; it should instead focus more on timing costly discovery optimally, to try to limit discovery to cases in which it is truly needed. Existing rules give courts discretion to use this proposal, but a new rule could minimize the risk of misusing the proposal to deny more discovery. This Article concludes by briefly noting how economic analyses must consider the details and information timing of the litigation process...|$|R

40|$|Understanding how {{communities}} of living organisms assemble {{has been a}} central question in ecology {{since the early days}} of the discipline. Disentangling the different processes involved in community assembly is not only interesting in itself but also crucial for an understanding of how communities will behave under future environmental scenarios. The traditional concept of assembly rules reflects the notion that species do not co-occur randomly but are restricted in their co-occurrence by interspecific competition. This concept can be redefined in a more general framework where the co-occurrence of species is a product of chance, historical patterns of speciation and migration, dispersal, abiotic environmental factors, and biotic interactions, with none of these processes being mutually exclusive. Here we present a survey and meta-analyses of 59 papers that compare observed patterns in plant communities with null models simulating random patterns of species assembly. According to the type of data under study and the different methods that are applied to detect community assembly, we distinguish four main types of approach in the published literature: species co-occurrence, niche limitation, guild <b>proportionality</b> and <b>limiting</b> similarity. Results from our meta-analyses suggest that non-random co-occurrence of plant species is not a widespread phenomenon. However, whether this finding reflects the individualistic nature of plant communities or is caused by methodological shortcomings associated with the studies considered cannot be discerned from the available metadata. We advocate that more thorough surveys be conducted using a set of standardized methods to test for the existence of assembly rules in data sets spanning larger biological and geographical scales than have been considered until now. We underpin this general advice with guidelines that should be considered in future assembly rules research.

Proportionality limitations on the penal power arise not from the purposes of punishment, but from the fact that punishing is not the only purpose that the state must pursue.

40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{contains}} {{a statement of}} basic provisions of the estimation method for the energy capacity of parts of mechanical transmissions of mining machinery. A method was substantiated {{for the assessment of}} the residual operation life period of large-pitch gears by means of regular hardness measurement of the superficial metal layer of the interaction gear surface. Patterns of gear hardness mutations of large-pitch gear transmissions were discovered. In order to investigate the influence of value and type of load upon the reduction of the operation life of the mechanical transmissions of mining machinery, an experimental fixture was built, and laboratory experimental work was done to study the destruction of non-standard elements. The strain parameters of the samples were determined, as well as local metal hardness changes in the areas adjoining the destruction spots. Crucial strain corresponds to the increased hardness with the limit value for the material given in the destruction area. In accordance with the experimental data, it was determined that the observed local hardness changes take place in areas where the stress is increased over the <b>proportionality</b> <b>limit,</b> and the work of the destruction forces assigned to the density of dislocations immediately adjoining the destruction plane is expressed as hardness increment, the latter being a constant value...|$|E
40|$|Because of the {{scarcity}} {{of information about the}} comparison of training to sedentarism beforehand immobilization and rehabilitation through muscle mechanical properties, the present work investigates this theme. Seventy rats were divided into 7 groups: 1 -control (C); 2 -trained (T); 3 -sedentary (S); 4 -trained and immobilized (TI); 5 -sedentary and immobilized (SI); 6 -trained, immobilized and rehabilitated (TIR); 7 -sedentary, immobilized and rehabilitated (SIR). Interventions: Swimming training; Sedentarism (reduced size cages); Cast immobilization (pelvic limb) and water rehabilitation. Load at the <b>limit</b> of <b>proportionality</b> (LLP), maximum <b>limit</b> load (MLL) and stiffness (St) were the mechanical properties determined after a mechanical test of traction of the gastrocnemius. The training improved all mechanical properties when compared to sedentarism. After immobilization, LLP and MLL were reduced in TI and SI. However, {{there was no difference in}} St between C and TI. Additionally, TI showed improved MLL when compared to SI. The comparison of TI and TIR showed significant melioration in all properties after remobilization. SIR showed an improvement only in MLL when compared to SI. Significant melioration in LLP and St was observed in TIR compared to SIR. We demonstrated that the training before immobilization and rehabilitation had a positive effect on the muscle mechanical behavior compared to sedentarism. This analysis is of fundamental importance because it helps characterize the muscle tissue under different functional demands...|$|R
40|$|Although {{a century}} {{has passed since}} the Supreme Court started {{reviewing}} criminal punishments for excessiveness under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, this area of doctrine remains highly problematic. The Court has never answered the claim that proportionality review is illegitimate {{in light of the}} Eighth Amendment’s original meaning. The Court has also adopted an ever-shifting definition of excessiveness, making the very concept of proportionality incoherent. Finally, the Court’s method of measuring proportionality is unreliable and self contradictory. As a result, a controlling plurality of the Court has insisted that <b>proportionality</b> review be <b>limited</b> to a narrow class of cases. This area of doctrine needs rethinking. This Article is the first to establish that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause was originally meant to prohibit excessive punishments as well as barbaric ones, and that proportionality review is therefore unquestionably legitimate. This Article also demonstrates that proportionality is a retributive concept, not a utilitarian one. Punishments are unconstitutionally excessive if they are harsher than the defendant deserves as a retributive matter. Finally, this Article shows that proportionality should be measured primarily in relation to prior punishment practice. The proposed approach will align the Court’s proportionality jurisprudence more closely with the core purpose of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause and will enable the Court to expand proportionality review to a much larger class of cases...|$|R
40|$|Assembly {{rules are}} {{measures}} of community structure that link observed patterns with ecological processes, {{and as such}} may help to elucidate the mechanisms by which species coexist. We apply two approaches to a lawn community - limiting similarity and guild proportionality - hoping that agreement between them might give robust conclusions. We tested for agreement between these two assembly rules using functional characters {{that are related to}} two aspects of species function - light capture and response to defoliation. We combined point quadrat data and a null model approach to test for limiting similarity - a tendency for species differing in functional characters to co-occur more often than expected at random - in turves extracted from the lawn community. Examining the variance in the characters of the species co-occuring at each point, evidence for limiting similarity was found for mowing removal (the proportion of leaf area removed in mowing events). There was greater variation between the species co-occurring at a point than expected at random (i. e., under an appropriate null model). However, no such evidence was found for characters related uniquely to light capture, such as specific leaf area and pigment concentrations. In a previous study in the same community, “intrinsic” guilds had been determined from co-occurrences within the lawn community and from a competition experiment, as those effective in determining species assembly and co-existence. These intrinsic guilds are shown by t-test to differ in the proportion of their biomass removed in mowing (MRI), which is of course related to the height at which their leaf area is held. However, again no differences were seen in characters related uniquely to light capture. Thus, the two different approaches to assembly rules - guild <b>proportionality</b> and <b>limiting</b> similarity - agree that differences in response to mowing are responsible for species co-existence in the lawn community. The agreement between these two approaches, tested on independent datasets of quite different type from the same community, gives possibly the strongest evidence so far that niche differentiation may be responsible for local co-existence in plant communities. However, although MRI is related to this co-existence the lack of correlation with light-capture characters leads to speculation that the effects might be via the below-ground behaviour of the species...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{method for}} deducing the stress–strain {{uniaxial}} properties of metallic materials from instrumented spherical indentation is presented {{along with an}} experimental verification. An extensive finite element parametric analysis of the spherical indentation was performed in order to generate a database of load vs. depth of penetration curves for classes of materials selected in order to represent the metals commonly employed in structural applications. The stress–strain curves of the materials were represented with three parameters: the Young modulus for the elastic regime, the stress of <b>proportionality</b> <b>limit</b> and the strain-hardening coefficient for the elastic–plastic regime. The indentation curves simulated by the finite element analyses were fitted {{in order to obtain}} a continuous function which can produce accurate load vs. depth curves for any combination of the constitutive elastic–plastic parameters. On the basis of this continuous function, an optimization algorithm was then employed to deduce the material elastic–plastic parameters and the related stress–strain curve when the measured load vs. depth curve is available by an instrumented spherical indentation test. The proposed method was verified by comparing the predicted stress–strain curves with those directly measured for several metallic alloys having different mechanical properties. This result confirms the possibility to deduce the complete stress–strain curve of a metal alloy with good accuracy by a properly conducted instrumented spherical indentation test and a suitable interpretation technique of the measured quantities...|$|E

40|$|Should the Eighth Amendment {{prohibit}} all undeserved criminal {{convictions and}} punishments? There are grounds {{to argue that}} it must. Correlation between the level of deserts of the accused and {{the severity of the}} sanction imposed represents the very idea of justice to most of us. We want to believe that those branded as criminals deserve blame for their conduct and that they deserve all of the punishment they receive. A deserts limitation is also key to explaining the decisions in which the Supreme Court has rejected convictions or punishments as disproportional, including several major rulings in the new millennium. Yet, this view of the Eighth Amendment challenges many current criminal-law doctrines and sentencing practices that favor crime prevention over retributive limits. Mistake-of-law doctrine, felony-murder rules, and mandatoryminimum sentencing laws are only a few examples. Why have these laws and practices survived? One answer is that the Supreme Court has <b>limited</b> <b>proportionality</b> relief to a few narrow problems involving the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole, and it has avoided openly endorsing the deserts limitation even in cases in which defendants have prevailed. This Article presents a deeper explanation. I point to four reasons why the doctrine must remain severely stunted in relation to its animating principle. I aim to clarify both what the Eighth Amendment reveals about the kind of people we would like to be and why the Supreme Court is not able to force us to live up to that aspiration...|$|R
40|$|Background: Survival {{analysis}} {{is sometimes called}} “time-to-event analysis”. The Cox model is used widely in survival analysis, where the covariates act multiplicatively on unknown baseline hazards. However, the Cox model requires the <b>proportionality</b> assumption, which <b>limits</b> its applications. The additive hazards model {{has been used as}} an alternative to the Cox model, where the covariates act additively on unknown baseline hazards. Objectives and methods: In this thesis, performance of the Cox multiplicative hazards model and the additive hazards model have been demonstrated and applied to the transfer, lifting and repositioning (TLR) injury prevention study. The TLR injury prevention study was a retrospective, pre-post intervention study that utilized a non-randomized control group. There were 1, 467 healthcare workers from six hospitals in Saskatchewan, Canada who were injured from January 1, 1999 to December 1, 2006. De-identified data sets were received from the Saskatoon Health Region and Regina Qu’appelle Health Region. Time to repeated TLR injury was considered as the outcome variable. The models’ goodness of fit was also assessed. Results: Of a total of 1, 467 individuals, 149 (56. 7 %) in the control group and 114 (43. 3 %) in the intervention group had repeated injuries during the study period. Nurses and nursing aides had the highest repeated TLR injuries (84. 8 %) among occupations. Back, neck and shoulders were the most common body parts injured (74. 9 %). These covariates were significant in both Cox multiplicative and additive hazards models. The intervention group had 27 % fewer repeated injuries than the control group in the multiplicative hazards model (HR= 0. 63; 95 % CI= 0. 48 - 0. 82; p-value= 0. 0002). In the additive model, the hazard difference between the intervention and the control groups was 0. 002. Conclusion: Both multiplicative and additive hazards models showed similar results, indicating that the TLR injury prevention intervention was effective in reducing repeated injuries. The additive hazards model is not widely used, but the coefficient of the covariates is easy to interpret in an additive manner. The additive hazards model should be considered when the proportionality assumption of the Cox model is doubtful...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: There is {{a strong}} {{evidence}} base that the stigma, discrimination and criminalization affecting adolescent key populations (KPs) aged 10 – 17 is intensified due to domestic and international legal constructs that rely on law-enforcement-based interventions dependent upon arrest, pre-trial detention, incarceration and compulsory “rehabilitation” in institutional placement. While there exists evidence and rights-based technical guidelines for interventions among older cohorts, these guidelines {{have not yet been}} embraced by international public health actors for fear that international law applies different standards to adolescents aged 10 – 17 who engage in behaviours such as selling sex or injecting drugs. Discussion: As a matter of international human rights, health, juvenile justice and child protection law, interventions among adolescent KPs aged 10 – 17 must not involve arrest, prosecution or detention of any kind. It is imperative that interventions not rely on law enforcement, but instead low-threshold, voluntary services, shelter and support, utilizing peer-based outreach as much as possible. These services must be mobile and accessible, and permit alternatives to parental consent for the provision of life-saving support, including HIV testing, treatment and care, needle and syringe programmes, opioid substitution therapy, safe abortions, antiretroviral therapy and gender-affirming care and hormone treatment for transgender adolescents. To ensure enrolment in services, international guidance indicates that informed consent and confidentiality must be ensured, including by waiver of parental consent requirements. To remove the disincentive to health practitioners and researchers to engaging with adolescent KPs aged 10 – 17 government agencies and ethical review boards are advised to exempt or grant waivers for mandatory reporting. In the event that, in violation of international law and guidance, authorities seek to involuntarily place adolescent KPs in institutions, they are entitled to judicial process. Legal guidelines also provide that these adolescents have influence over their placement, access to legal counsel to challenge the conditions of their detention and regular visitation from peers, friends and family, and that all facilities be subject to frequent and periodic review by independent agencies, including community-based groups led by KPs. Conclusions: Controlling international law specifies that protective interventions among KPs aged 10 – 17 must not only include low-threshold, voluntary services but also “protect” adolescent KPs from the harms attendant to law-enforcement-based interventions. Going forward, health practitioners must honour the right to health by adjusting programmes according to principles of minimum intervention, due process and <b>proportionality,</b> and duly <b>limit</b> juvenile justice and child protection involvement as a measure of last resort, if any...|$|R
