5|$|For two years, Bahá'u'lláh {{lived alone}} in the {{mountains}} of Kurdistan. He originally lived as a hermit, dressed like a dervish and used the name Darvish Muhammad-i-Irani. At one point someone noticed his <b>penmanship,</b> which brought the curiosity of the instructors of the local Sufi orders. As he began to take guests, he became noted for his learning and wisdom. Shaykh `Uthmán, Shaykh `Abdu'r-Rahmán, and Shaykh Ismá'íl, leaders of the Naqshbandíyyih, Qádiríyyih, and Khálidíyyih Orders respectively, began to seek his advice. It was to the second of these that the Four Valleys was written. Bahá'u'lláh wrote several other notable books during this time.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with her}} classmates, she {{was chosen by}} Kamehameha III to be {{eligible}} for the throne of the Kingdom of Hawaii. She was taught in English by American missionaries Amos Starr Cooke and his wife, Juliette Montague Cooke, alongside her royal cousins. She was taught reading, spelling, <b>penmanship,</b> arithmetic, geometry, algebra, physics, geography, history, bookkeeping, singing and English composition by the missionary couple. In the classroom students were divided by their age and/or length of time at the school. The older group consisted of Moses Kekūāiwa, Lot Kapuāiwa, Alexander Liholiho, William Charles Lunalilo, Jane Loeau, Bernice Pauahi, Abigail Maheha and Elizabeth Kekaʻaniau who had attended the school since 1839. The next class consisted of Emma Rooke, James Kaliokalani, Peter Kaʻeo and David Kalākaua. Due to her late attendance, Mary Paʻaʻāina was placed in the youngest class together with Victoria Kamāmalu, Lydia Kamakaʻeha (Liliʻuokalani), and John William Pitt Kīnaʻu. During their Sunday procession to church it was customary for boys and girls to walk side by side, Paʻaʻāina would walk beside her first cousin Peter Kaʻeo.|$|E
25|$|He {{was known}} for his {{determination}} to achieve goals that were seemingly beyond his reach. As a child, he wanted to join the baseball team that would win the Utah territorial championship, but others believed him to be too physically awkward to be successful. In response, he purchased a baseball and practiced throwing the ball for hours against his barn to improve. The team he joined later won the championship. In similar fashion, Grant expressed a desire to be a successful bookkeeper although many of his associates criticized his <b>penmanship.</b> He practiced his writing to the point that he was invited to teach <b>penmanship</b> at one of the local academies.|$|E
25|$|Boys {{and girls}} had {{separate}} classes until about 1870. Boys learned useful {{skills such as}} woodshop, surveying, and bookkeeping, and girls had classes like sewing. However, Westtown eventually recognized that students of both genders should know basic academic subjects such as reading, <b>penmanship,</b> grammar, mathematics, geography, and science.|$|E
25|$|Under Dermott's influence, <b>penmanship,</b> and oratory, the new Grand Lodge grew to be {{a serious}} {{challenge}} to the original. The Antient's lodges were warranted from 1752, a practice not taken up by the Moderns for another two decades. As the unaffiliated lodges increasingly saw the sense of belonging to a larger organisation, they usually found that the Antients practice was closer to their own, although it was known for lodges to change allegiance from the Antients to the Moderns. The fact that the practices eventually adopted by the United Grand Lodge largely reflect those of the Antients is attributable to Dermott's industry.|$|E
25|$|When copies are not {{sufficient}} for accurate transcription, PJM staff may travel to the repositories to view the originals of Madison's papers. Many originals are held by the Library of Congress and the National Archives of the United States. The Library of Congress makes digital images of their collection available free for online public viewing via American Memory. This resource allows interested scholars {{to become familiar with}} the evolution of Madison's style over his lifetime, and also gives them the opportunity to see the varieties of <b>penmanship</b> and languages Madison had to decipher. Interpreting some of these more complex documents, particularly those from non-native English speakers and from correspondents with limited formal education, {{is one of the more}} interesting challenges the PJM staff deals with on a regular basis.|$|E
25|$|On April 10, 1854 Bahá'u'lláh left Baghdad {{in order}} to {{distance}} himself from Subh-i-Azal and as to avoid becoming the source of disagreement within the Babi community; he left with one companion to the mountains of Kurdistan, north-east of Baghdad, near the city Sulaymaniyah. For two years Bahá'u'lláh lived alone in the mountains of Kurdistan living the life of a Sufi dervish. At one point someone noticed his remarkable <b>penmanship,</b> which brought the curiosity of the instructors of the local Sufi orders. During his time in Kurdistan he wrote many notable books including the Four Valleys. In Baghdad, given the lack of firm and public leadership by Subh-i-Azal, the Babi community had fallen into disarray. Some Babis, including Bahá'u'lláh's family, thus searched for Bahá'u'lláh, and pleaded with him to come back to Baghdad, which he did in 1856.|$|E
25|$|Early {{symptoms}} {{may include}} loss of precision muscle coordination (sometimes first manifested in declining <b>penmanship,</b> frequent small injuries to the hands, and dropped items), cramping pain with sustained use, and trembling. Significant muscle pain and cramping {{may result from}} very minor exertions like holding a book and turning pages. It may become {{difficult to find a}} comfortable position for arms and legs with even the minor exertions associated with holding arms crossed causing significant pain similar to restless leg syndrome. Affected persons may notice trembling in the diaphragm while breathing, or the need to place hands in pockets, under legs while sitting or under pillows while sleeping to keep them still and to reduce pain. Trembling in the jaw may be felt and heard while lying down, and the constant movement to avoid pain may result in the grinding and wearing down of teeth, or symptoms similar to temporomandibular joint disorder. The voice may crack frequently or become harsh, triggering frequent throat clearing. Swallowing can become difficult and accompanied by painful cramping.|$|E
25|$|Mandy, Whitworth's step-mother, {{reported}} the Police knocking {{on her door}} to inform her they had found Daniel's body. She says she was led to believe Daniel had overdosed on drugs, despite no investigation having taken place. Police didn't treat the death as suspicious, despite bruising found under Daniel's arms, {{which led to a}} coroner reporting that third-party involvement could not be ruled out. The Police took the fake suicide note left by Port with Daniel's body at face-value. They sent a small fragment of the letter to Mandy and Daniel's father, Adam, asking them to verify if it was Daniel's <b>penmanship.</b> They looked at the writing on the note and compared it with Daniel's writing from Birthday cards and other mementos. They reported back to the Police saying they were unsure if it was Daniel's writing, as they didn't often see his handwriting and they couldn't say for certain. Mandy reported that Dagenham Police had told her they had experts who can analyse the writing and determine whether it is Daniel's or not, and Mandy assumed this is what the Police would do. It is later shown at trial that Dagenham Police documented that Mandy and Adam had confirmed the handwriting was Daniel's, despite them telling the Police they were unsure. It came to light that handwriting professionals had not investigated the note, but that untrained Police Officers had 'taken a look' at the note themselves. Mandy maintains that if specialists had looked further into this note, they could have found Port earlier.|$|E
500|$|During the war, Hamilton became {{close friends}} with several fellow officers. His {{letters to the}} Marquis de Lafayette and to John Laurens, {{employing}} the sentimental literary conventions of {{the late eighteenth century}} and alluding to Greek history and mythology, have been read by Jonathan Ned Katz, as revealing a homosocial or perhaps homosexual relationship. [...] On the other hand, biographer Gregory D. Massey dismisses all speculations on a Laurens-Hamilton relationship as unsubstantiated, describing their friendship as purely platonic camaraderie and placing their correspondence {{in the context of the}} flowery <b>penmanship</b> of the time.|$|E
500|$|Referred to as Kali by his teachers, he {{was taught}} in English by the Cookes {{alongside}} his royal cousins. They were taught reading, spelling, <b>penmanship,</b> arithmetic, geometry, algebra, physics, geography, history, bookkeeping, singing and English composition by the missionary couple. In the classroom students were divided by their age {{and length of}} time at the school. Kaliokalani {{was a member of}} the second level class with Emma Rooke, Peter Kaʻeo and his brother David Kalākaua. During their Sunday procession to church it was customary for boys and girls to walk side by side, Kali would walk beside his cousin Elizabeth Kekaʻaniau.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of the commissioners accepted the casket letters as genuine after a study of their contents and comparison of the <b>penmanship</b> with examples of Mary's handwriting. Elizabeth, as she had wished, concluded the inquiry with a verdict that nothing was proven, either against the confederate lords or Mary. For overriding political reasons, Elizabeth wished neither to convict nor acquit Mary of murder, and {{there was never any}} intention to proceed judicially; the conference was intended as a political exercise. In the end, Moray returned to Scotland as its regent, and Mary remained in custody in England. Elizabeth had succeeded in maintaining a Protestant government in Scotland, without either condemning or releasing her fellow sovereign. In Fraser's opinion, {{it was one of the}} strangest [...] "trials" [...] in legal history, ending with no finding of guilt against either party with one let home to Scotland while the other remained in custody.|$|E
500|$|In 1757, Jones was {{appointed}} by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, to serve as Clerk of Court for Hampshire County. Jones was on close terms with Lord Fairfax, and George Rockingham Gilmer described Jones as a [...] "kinsman, friend and executor of Lord Fairfax". Despite the county's establishment in 1754, {{it was not until}} 1757 that formal record-keeping was actualized in Hampshire County, {{due in part to the}} French and Indian War. While Archibald Wager was likely the first appointed Clerk of Court for Hampshire County, Jones was the first operational appointee to serve in the position. According to historian Wilmer L. Kerns in Hampshire County, West Virginia, 1754–2004 (2004), Jones was [...] "well-organized" [...] and had the [...] "best <b>penmanship</b> of any clerk in the history of the county, in spite of being totally blind in his right eye". Historians Hu Maxwell and Howard Llewellyn Swisher described Jones's handwriting as [...] "unmistakable" [...] in their History of Hampshire County, West Virginia (1897).|$|E
500|$|After graduating, Arthur {{returned}} to Schaghticoke {{and became a}} full-time teacher, and soon began to pursue an education in law. While studying law, he continued teaching, moving closer to home by taking {{a job at a}} school in North Pownal, Vermont. Coincidentally, future president James A. Garfield taught <b>penmanship</b> at the same school three years later, but the two did not cross paths during their teaching careers. In 1852, Arthur moved again, to Cohoes, New York, to become the principal of a school at which his sister, Malvina, was a teacher. In 1853, after studying at State and National Law School in Ballston Spa, New York, and then saving enough money to relocate, Arthur moved to New York City to read law at the law office of Erastus D. Culver, an abolitionist lawyer and family friend. [...] When Arthur was admitted to the New York bar in 1854, he joined Culver's firm, which was subsequently renamed Culver, Parker, and Arthur.|$|E
500|$|After {{studying}} <b>penmanship,</b> bookkeeping {{and business}} law in North Central College (by then Northwestern College), he failed as {{an owner of}} a local hardware store. Gates became interested in barbed wire and became a salesman for the Washburn-Moen Company. [...] When {{he was assigned to}} the Texas sales territory, he learned that ranchers were adamant about not buying his product. Gates staged a demonstration of the wire in San Antonio's Military Plaza with charging cattle failing to break the barbed wire fences he had set up. [...] He then proved very successful in selling the company's product, and went on to start his own barbed wire manufacturing business, which eventually led to the production of steel. In the process, his company was purchased by J. P. Morgan's U. S. Steel. Gates was not invited {{to become part of the}} company, and he fought back at Morgan for many years through a series of business acquisitions and sales; both men were key figures in the Panic of 1907.|$|E
500|$|Alfred {{intended}} to give his son the same education he himself had received. At age nine, Edward {{was sent to a}} day school in Philadelphia and in 1853 at the age of 12, Edward was sent to the Friends' Boarding School at Westtown, near West Chester, Pennsylvania. The school was founded in 1799 with fundraising by members of the Society of Friends (Quakers), and provided much of the Cope family's education. The prestigious school was expensive, costing Alfred $500 in tuition each year, and in his first year, Edward studied algebra, chemistry, scripture, physiology, grammar, astronomy, and Latin. Edward's letters home requesting a larger allowance show he was able to manipulate his father, and he was, according to author and Cope biographer Jane Davidson, [...] "a bit of a spoiled brat". His letters suggest he was lonely at the school—it {{was the first time he}} had been away from his home for an extended period. Otherwise, Edward's studies progressed much like a typical boy—he consistently had [...] "less than perfect" [...] or [...] "not quite satisfactory" [...] marks for conduct from his teachers, and did not work hard on his <b>penmanship</b> lessons, which may have contributed to his often illegible handwriting as an adult.|$|E
500|$|In 1842, {{at the age}} of four, {{she began}} her {{education}} at the Chiefs' Children's School (later known as the Royal School). She, along with her classmates, had been formally proclaimed by Kamehameha III as eligible for the throne of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Liliʻuokalani later noted that these [...] "pupils were exclusively persons whose claims to the throne were acknowledged." [...] She, along with her two older brothers James Kaliokalani and David Kalākaua, and her thirteen royal cousins, was taught in English by American missionaries Amos Starr Cooke and his wife, Juliette Montague Cooke. The children were taught reading, spelling, <b>penmanship,</b> arithmetic, geometry, algebra, physics, geography, history, bookkeeping, singing and English composition by the missionary couple who had to control the moral and sexual development of their charges. Liliʻuokalani was placed in the youngest section of the class with Princess Victoria Kamāmalu, Mary Polly Paʻaʻāina, and John William Pitt Kīnaʻu. In later life, Liliʻuokalani would look back unfavorably on her early education remembering being [...] "sent hungry to bed" [...] and the 1848 measles epidemic that claimed the life of a classmate Moses Kekūāiwa and her younger sister Kaʻiminaʻauao. The boarding school run by the Cookes was discontinued around 1850, so she, along with her former classmate Victoria Kamāmalu, was sent to the relocated day school (also called Royal School) run by Reverend Edward G. Beckwith.|$|E
500|$|In October 1861, Foraker {{left his}} parents' home {{to go to}} the county seat of Hillsboro where he was to live with his uncle, James Reece, auditor of Highland County, and work as a clerk in his office. [...] He was sent to replace his older brother, Burch, by then enlisted in the Union Army as the American Civil War was raging. [...] Foraker noted in his memoirs that while his time as auditor's clerk greatly {{improved}} his <b>penmanship,</b> it also brought him into contact with many county officials, teaching him how a government worked. [...] The young clerk was impressed by his brother's letters home, and was anxious to join the army despite his youth. [...] Soon after his 16th birthday, Joseph Foraker learned that a family friend was organizing a volunteer company, and sought to enlist. [...] His uncle gave reluctant consent, and on July 14, 1862, Foraker was mustered in Company [...] "A", 89th Ohio Volunteer Infantry; in late August, after training, he became second sergeant. [...] With Confederate forces moving through Kentucky and threatening Cincinnati, the 89th was hurried into defenses set up across the Ohio River in Newport, Kentucky. [...] The Confederates did not reach the Ohio, having been forced back well to the south, and the 89th moved to Fort Shaler, near Newport. [...] While Foraker was at Fort Shaler, President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation; Foraker recounted in his memoirs that he and his comrades felt that the proclamation meant that they were fighting for the end of slavery, not just to preserve the Union.|$|E
500|$|After leaving Geauga, Garfield {{worked for}} a year at various jobs, {{including}} teaching. Finding that some New Englanders worked their way through college, Garfield determined to do the same, and first sought a school that could prepare him for the entrance examinations. From 1851 to 1854, he attended the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute (later named Hiram College) in Hiram, Ohio, a school run by the Disciples. While there, he was most interested {{in the study of}} Greek and Latin, but was inclined to learn about and discuss any new thing he encountered. Securing a position on entry as janitor, he was hired to teach while still a student. Lucretia Rudolph had also enrolled at the Institute, and Garfield wooed her while teaching her Greek. He developed a regular preaching circuit at neighboring churches, in some cases earning a gold dollar per service. By 1854, Garfield had learned all the Institute could teach him and was a full-time teacher. Garfield then enrolled at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, as a third-year student, given credit for two years' study at the Institute after passing a cursory examination. Garfield was impressed with the college president, Mark Hopkins, who had responded warmly to Garfield's letter inquiring about admission. He said of Hopkins, [...] "The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of a log with a student on the other." [...] Hopkins later stated about Garfield in his student days, [...] "There was a large general capacity applicable to any subject. There was no pretense of genius, or alternation of spasmodic effort, but a satisfactory accomplishment in all directions." [...] After his first term, Garfield was hired to teach <b>penmanship</b> to the students of nearby Pownal, Vermont, a post whose previous incumbent was Chester A. Arthur.|$|E

2500|$|Among her {{possessions}} was {{a letter}} written in pencil with the name [...] "Gloria" [...] on it. The letter {{said that she was}} [...] "on break," [...] which led to speculation that she may have had a job at the time. It also made references to people whom she had met in the states of North Carolina and Virginia. The <b>penmanship</b> was said to be poor, and no address was on the envelope.|$|E
2500|$|Further extrasensory {{communication}} ensued. The automatic writing {{gradually became}} easier and the handwriting became {{that of her}} mother's. According to Vera and her father, Vera's handwriting [...] "had always been rounded, loopy and backward-sloping." [...] Vera had struggled to correct this having been repeatedly told at school that such <b>penmanship</b> was [...] "a sign of bad character". But {{no matter how often}} school masters implored her, she could not remedy matters. But whilst transmitting messages from her mother, her own handwriting became sharp, pointed and italic, sloping [...] "steeply forwards" [...] like her mother's.|$|E
2500|$|Turning to {{nationalism}} {{during the}} Second Balkan War, Diamandy gave morale-supporting lectures to infantrymen of the Land Forces, having already prefaced a textbook of military pedagogy, by Colonel Gheorghe Șuer. In June 1913, {{he also wrote}} the foreword to a social geography tract by Major G. A. Dabija. The work {{as a whole was}} probably the first in history to justify Romania's colonization of Southern Dobruja, formerly in the Kingdom of Bulgaria. As later noted by Dabija, Diamandy's [...] "unofficial" [...] <b>penmanship</b> was required to divert attention from this being the expansionist policy of a Conservative government.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design of}} White House invitations {{has evolved over}} time. Dinner invitations {{going back to the}} {{administration}} of John Adams, the first president to live in the White House, are archived and have inspired the current invitations.

[...] Space allowed for the hand penned insertion of [...] "& Mrs. Adams" [...] if the First Lady were to attend, as well as individual guests' names, and the date and time. A flowing round hand type of <b>penmanship</b> was used. This style of writing was found in writing manuals in the 18th century.|$|E
2500|$|Tobey's {{arrival in}} Seattle in 1921 {{was in part}} an effort for a new start {{following}} a marriage and quick divorce. [...] When his ex-wife found Tobey's address, she sent him a box of his clothes topped {{with a copy of}} Rudyard Kipling's The Light That Failed. In the following year, Tobey met Teng Kuei, a Chinese painter and student at the University of Washington, who introduced Tobey to Eastern <b>penmanship,</b> beginning Tobey’s exploration of Chinese calligraphy. The beginning of his lifelong travels occurred in 1925 when he left for Europe, settling in Paris where Tobey met Gertrude Stein. He spent a winter at Châteaudun, and also traveled to Barcelona and Greece. In Constantinople, Beirut and Haifa, he studied Arab and Persian writing.|$|E
