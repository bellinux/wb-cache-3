40|$|A {{theoretical}} model of intra-axonal transport is proposed that presupposes a carrier system {{moving down the}} axon in a distal direction. Protein and particle transport is achieved by their reversible association with the distally moving carriers. Mathematical equations representing the concentrations of moving carriers and proteins and/or particles within the axon at any position and time are proposed. Analysis of the equations demonstrates that a traveling wave solution for the particle concentration (an experimental fact) is possible provided the chemical interaction between particles and carriers exhibits positive cooperativity. The phase velocity of the wave solution is interpreted as the observed velocity of the intra-axonal transport, known to be independent <b>of</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation.</b> In addition, the theory predicts a spectrum of transport velocities for different proteins, in agreement with <b>observations.</b> The velocity <b>of</b> a given protein is dependent on its affinity to the carrier...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} uses a model <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> {{derived from}} Michel Foucault 2 ̆ 7 s Discipline and Punish {{to examine the}} relationship between writing and seeing in each of the writers discussed. The disciplinary model of the Panopticon, as Foucault outlines it, constructs a neutral observer, a figure supposedly 2 ̆ 2 without qualities 2 ̆ 2 but nevertheless implicitly male, in part because Western tradition has always constructed men as observers and women as objects <b>of</b> <b>observation.</b> But what happens when a woman takes up this observational position and attemps to become the subject of her own gaze? In Prisons We Choose to Live Inside, Doris Lessing explicitly develops a theory of the writer as observer. Close reading <b>of</b> moments <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> in Particularly Cats, Going Home, African Laughter, and The Fifth Child shows that Lessing 2 ̆ 7 s model <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> assumes she can freely take up a 2 ̆ 2 neutral 2 ̆ 2 <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> without addressing the history <b>of</b> that <b>position,</b> whether in general philosophical terms or in terms of the particular experiences which allowed her to assume that position. In contrast, Christa Wolf is quite conscious of the structures of observational power in which she would construct herself as an observer. If the figure of a woman observing a woman observing which appears in Kindheitsmuster, Kassandra, and Was bleibt allows her to depict how the gendering of power controls and contains alternative perspectives, it does not allow her to overcome the structures of that power. Finally, Marguerite Duras 2 ̆ 7 active manipulation of women 2 ̆ 7 s passive position in 2 ̆ 2 Le boa 2 ̆ 2 and L 2 ̆ 7 Amant breaks the structures <b>of</b> disciplinary <b>observation</b> and allows her to construct a nondisciplinary woman observer.

This one position, which appears in Hiroshima mon amour and La Douleur, is not susceptible to the transformation from passivity to activity with which Duras 2 ̆ 7 figures otherwise construct themselves as observing women. ...|$|R
40|$|We have {{measured}} {{the velocity of}} actin filaments in in vitro motility assay by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. In this method, one measures fluctuations {{in the number of}} filaments in an open sample volume. The number of filaments was calculated from measurements of fluorescence of rhodamine-phalloidin bound to F-actin. Sample volume was defined by a diaphragm placed in front of the photomultiplier. Fluctuations arise when actin filaments enter and leave the sample volume due to translations driven by mechanochemical interactions with myosin heads which are immobilized on a glass surface. The average velocity of the translation of filaments determined by the correlation method, (Vc), was equal to the diameter of the diaphragm divided by the half-time of the relaxation of fluctuations. The average number of moving filaments determined by correlation method, (Nc), was inversely proportional to the relative fluctuations. By the fluctuation method it was possible to determine the average velocity of over 800 moving filaments in less than 4 min. There was good agreement between (Vc) and (Nc) and the average velocity and the average number of moving filaments determined manually. To be able to apply correlation measurements to an experimental problem, neither (Vc) nor (Nc) must depend on the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> <b>of</b> filaments. We first confirmed that this was indeed the case. We then applied the method to investigate the dependence of motility on the ATPase activity of myosin heads. ATPase activity was varied by mixing intact heads with heads which were labeled with different thiol reagents. It was found that the motion was drastically influenced by the reagent used for modification. When the reagent was N-ethyl-maleimide, 1. 5 % modification was sufficient to completely inhibit the motion. When the reagent was 5 -iodoacetamidofluorescein, motion declined hyperbolically with the fraction of modified heads...|$|R

40|$|In {{a series}} of {{experiments}} with different osmotic potentials in the root environment, various vegetables, and ornamentals were grown in a substrate system. The osmotic potential was varied by addition of nutrients. Yield characteristics of the crop {{were related to the}} osmotic potential of the nutrient solution. Experimental results were fitted to a discontinuous piecewise linear response model introduced by Maas and Hoffman in 1977 and this study extended the investigation by introducing a polynomial and an exponential test model. The correlation coefficients for the polynomial and exponential model were generally higher than with the piecewise linear model. The polynomial model has the drawback that calculation of the salinity yield decrease (SYD) value is not possible. Salinity threshold values could be calculated with all models tested. The average values did not show great differences and the EC values found were 2. 4, 2. 1, and 2. 2 dS m- 1 for the polynomial, exponential, and peace wise linear model, respectively. It is argued that the exponential equations showed the closest relationships between the EC in the root environment and the yield characteristics of the crops. Fifth order polynomial equations yielded at least equal or even higher correlation coefficients, but these equations are very responsive to accidental <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>observations.</b> The traditional discontinuous linear fitting gave reasonable results, but only when experimental observations below the threshold value were selected and discarded. This undermines the power of this model, because exclusion <b>of</b> <b>observations</b> is always arbitrary. Furthermore, a discontinuous relationship between crop yield and EC in the root environment is not likely, because yield response is of biological nature. Nevertheless, when the number <b>of</b> <b>observations</b> is not sufficient for the quantification of the exponential equation, mostly reasonable estimations of the salinity parameters can be obtained with the Maas and Hoffman model...|$|R

We have been developing an observation system for seafloor crustal deformation. This system consists of two main components; (1) kinematic GPS <b>positioning</b> <b>of</b> an <b>observation</b> vessel and (2) accurate acoustic measurements of distances between a transponder attached {{on the side of the}} vessel (onboard station) and one located on the ocean bottom (seafloor station). In this study, we performed numerical simulations to estimate measurement errors with acoustic positioning assuming acoustic velocities in the sea water and the distribution <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> points around the single seafloor station. We found that the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the seafloor station which we can obtain by analyzing travel-time data might have around 18 -cm discrepancy with respect to its “true” position. Colombo et al. (2001) reported that the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the vessel can be determined with about 10 -cm error by kinematic GPS positioning. These results indicate that the system should be able to detect seafloor crustal deformation much larger than 28 cm, including pre-, co-, and post-seismic slips due to the large earthquakes at subduction zones, slow and silent earthquakes, etc. Therefore, we emphasize the importance <b>of</b> continuous <b>observations</b> with a nationwide geodetic observational network for seafloor crustal deformation.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the effect of}} planar dielectric interfaces (e. g., solid/liquid) on the fluorescence emission of nearby probes. First, we derive an integral expression for the electric field radiated by an oscillating electric dipole when it is close to a dielectric interface. The electric field depends on the refractive indices of the interface, {{the orientation of the}} dipole, the distance from the dipole to the interface, and the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation.</b> We numerically calculate the electric field intensity for a dipole on an interface, as a function <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> <b>position.</b> These results are applicable to fluorescent molecules excited by the evanescent field of a totally internally reflected laser beam and thus very close to a solid/liquid interface. Next, we derive an integral expression for the electric field radiated when a second dielectric interface is also close to the fluorescent molecule. We numerically calculate this intensity as observed through the second interface. These results are useful when the fluorescence is collected by a high-aperture microscope objective. Finally, we define and calculate a "dichroic factor," which describes the efficiency of collection, in the two-interface system, of polarized fluorescence. The limit when the first interface is removed is applicable for any high-aperture collection of polarized or unpolarized fluorescence. The limit when the second interface is removed has application in the collection of fluorescence with any aperture from molecules close to a dielectric interface. The results of this paper are required for the interpretation of order parameter measurements on fluorescent probes in supported phospholipid monolayers (Thompson, N. L., H. M. McConnell, and T. P.
