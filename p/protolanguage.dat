5000|$|According to the {{traditional}} binary tree model, Proto-Uralic diverged into Proto-Samoyedic and Proto-Finno-Ugric. However, reconstructed Proto-Finno-Ugric differs little from Proto-Uralic, and many apparent differences follow from the methods used. Thus Proto-Finno-Ugric may not be separate from Proto-Uralic. Another reconstruction of the split of Proto-Uralic has three branches (Finno-Permic, Ugric and Samoyedic) from the start. Recently these tree-like models have been challenged by the hypothesis of larger number of <b>protolanguages</b> giving a [...] "comb" [...] rather than a tree. The <b>protolanguages</b> would be Sami, (Baltic&#8209;)Finnic, Mordva, Mari, Permic, Magyar, Khanti, Mansi, and Samoyedic. This order is both the order of geographical positions as well as linguistic similarity, with neighboring languages being more similar than distant ones.|$|R
2500|$|Little {{explicit}} {{evidence has}} however been presented {{in favor of}} Donner's model since his original proposal, and numerous alternate schemes have been proposed.

40|$|Abstract. There is {{an ongoing}} debate about whether {{the words in the}} first {{languages}} spoken by humans expressed single concepts or complex holophrases. A computer model was used to investigate the nature of the <b>protolanguages</b> that would arise if speakers could associate words and meanings, but lacked any productive ability beyond saying the word whose past uses most closely matched the meaning that they wished to express. It was found that both words expressing single concepts, and holophrastic words could arise, depending on the conceptual and articulatory abilities of the agents. However, most words were of an intermediate type, as they expressed more than a single concept but less than a holophrase. The model therefore demonstrates that <b>protolanguages</b> may have been of types that are not usually considered in the debate over the nature of the first human languages...|$|R
50|$|Proto-Uralic is the reconstructed {{language}} ancestral to the Uralic language family.

5000|$|Eurasiatic {{and another}} {{proposed}} macrofamily Nostratic often include {{many of the}} same language families. Vladislav Illich-Svitych's Nostratic dictionary did not include the smaller Siberian language families listed in Eurasiatic, but this was only because <b>protolanguages</b> had not been reconstructed for them; Nostraticists have not attempted to exclude these languages from Nostratic. Many Nostratic theorists have accepted Eurasiatic as a subgroup within Nostratic alongside Afroasiatic, Kartvelian, and Dravidian. [...] LWED likewise views Eurasiatic as a subfamily of Nostratic. [...] The Nostratic family is not endorsed by the mainstream of comparative linguistics.|$|R

40|$|At {{least seven}} {{terms with the}} meaning 'to swallow' can be reconstructed for Proto-Oceanic, and four more for lower-level <b>protolanguages.</b> All of these bear some phonological {{resemblance}} to each other, and also to forms reconstructed for Proto-Austronesian and Proto-Malayo-Polynesian (some of which have the meaning 'to sink, drown, disappear under water'). Only two, however, directly continue earlier terms.

50|$|In the 19th century, Robert Latham {{suggested}} that the Siouan languages {{are related to the}} Caddoan and Iroquoian languages.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Wallace Chafe further explored the link between Siouan and Caddoan languages. In the 1990s, Marianne Mithun compared the morphology and syntax of all the three families. At present, this Macro-Siouan hypothesis is not considered proved, and the similarities between the three families may instead be due to their <b>protolanguages</b> having been part of a sprachbund.|$|R

Recent research within Oceanic, however, suggests that patterns of regular penultimate-syllable stress are not as widespread throughout the family as was initially thought, and that certain interstage <b>protolanguages</b> need to be reconstructed with something other than regular penultimate-syllable stress and something other than the pattern exhibited by their daughter languages. By investigating stress patterns {{in a wide range of}} Oceanic languages, I show (i) that POc stress was probably assigned on the basis of moraic rather than syllabic trochees, with word-²nal closed syllables being treated as “heavy” and thus receiving primary stress, and (ii) that other modern patterns developed quite independently in a number of languages...|$|R
