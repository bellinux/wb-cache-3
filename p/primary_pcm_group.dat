The main objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the possible role of Langerhans' cells (LC) in the pathogenesis of the disease in tissue samples from skin lesions, using immunohistochemical technique. Thirty-three medical records were selected with their respective paraffin blocks of skin biopsies from patients with DJL (group 1) registered in the dermatology service at the Federal University of Para in the period from 1955 to 2005. The control group consisted of 10 paraffin blocks from normal skin (group 2) and 42 blocks from patients with paracoccidioidomycosis (<b>PCM)</b> (<b>Group</b> 3). In the analysis of patient medical records data were collected regarding age, sex, origin, profession, location and clinical type of the lesions.

This study evaluated {{the impact of}} a streamlined PCM delivered through a Medicaid managed care organization (MMCO), an infrastructure with the potential to sustain this program for the long term. METHODS This randomized trial was conducted within an MMCO serving New York City between May 2005 and December 2005. A total of 1, 316 women aged 40 to 69 years and not up to date for at least 1 targeted cancer-screening test were randomized to either PCM or a comparison group. Women in the <b>PCM</b> <b>group</b> received up to 3 scripted telephone calls to identify barriers and provide support to obtain any needed breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer-screen-ing tests. Women in the comparison group received a modifi ed version of the MMCO’s established mammography telephone outreach program, also in up to 3 calls. Women in both groups received a fi nancial incentive on confi rmation that they had received a mammogram. Screening status was assessed through MMCO administrative data. Groups were compared using odds ratios. RESULTS In an intent-to-treat comparison adjusted for baseline screening status, PCM women were 1. 69 {{times more likely to be}} up-to-date for colorectal cancer-screening tests at follow-up than women in the comparison group (95 % confi-dence interval, 1. 03 - 2. 77). Follow-up screening rates for cervical and breast can-cer did not differ signifi cantly between study groups on an intent-to-treat basis. CONCLUSIONS The abbreviated PCM telephone intervention was feasible to deliver through an MMCO and improved screening for 1 cancer. This approach has the potential to improve cancer-screening rates signifi cantly in settings that can provide telephone support to women known to be overdue. Ann Fam Med 2007; 5 : 320 - 327.

40|$|Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a {{systemic}} granulomatous disease, endemic in Latin America, {{caused by the}} thermal dimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Although some fungal antigens have already been characterized and used for serological diagnosis, cross-reactions have been frequently observed. Thus, the examination of fungal forms in clinical specimens or isolation of P. brasiliensis by culture {{is still the most}} frequent method for the diagnosis of this mycosis. in this study, a random peptide phage display library was used to select mimotopes of P. brasiliensis, which were employed as antigens in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the protective monoclonal antibody against experimental PCM (anti-gp 75) was used as molecular target to screen a phage display library. That approach led to a synthetic peptide named P 2, which was synthesized and tested against PCM patients' sera to check whether it was recognized. There was significant recognition of P 2 by sera of untreated PCM patients when compared with normal human sera. Sera from treated <b>PCM</b> <b>group,</b> patients with other mycosis or co-infected with HIV had much lower recognition of P 2 than untreated patient group. the test showed a sensitivity of 100 and 94. 59 % of specificity in relation to human sera control. These data indicate a potential use of P 2 as diagnostic tool in PCM. Its application for serological diagnosis of PCM may contribute to the development and standardization of simpler, faster and highly reproducible immunodiagnostic tests at low cost.

40|$|Phase change {{materials}} (PCM) used in {{thermal energy}} storage (TES) systems have been presented, over recent years, {{as one of the}} most effective options in energy storage. Paraffin and fatty acids are some of the most used PCM in TES systems, as they have high phase change enthalpy and in addition they do not present subcooling nor hysteresis and have proper cycling stability. The simulations and design of TES systems require the knowledge of the thermophysical properties of PCM. Thermal conductivity, viscosity, specific heat capacity (Cp) can be experimentally determined, but these are material and time consuming tasks. To avoid or to reduce them, and to have reliable data without the need of experimentation, thermal properties can be calculated by empirical equations. In this study, five different equations are given to calculate the viscosity and specific heat capacity of fatty acid PCM and paraffin PCM. Two of these equations concern, respectively, the empirical calculation of the viscosity and liquid Cp of the whole paraffin PCM family, while the other three equations presented are for the corresponding calculation of viscosity, solid Cp, liquid Cp of the whole fatty acid family of PCM. Therefore, this study summarize the work performed to obtain the main empirical equations to measure the above mentioned properties for whole fatty acid PCM family and whole paraffin PCM family. Moreover, empirical equations have been obtained to calculate these properties for other materials of these <b>PCM</b> <b>groups</b> and these empirical equations can be extrapolated for PCM with higher or lower phase change temperatures within a lower relative error 4 %.

However, functional integration of SCMs requires similar electrophysiological properties as <b>primary</b> cardiomyocytes (<b>PCMs)</b> and the ability to establish intercellular connections with host myocytes in order to contribute to the electrical and mechanical activity of the heart. The aim of this project was to investigate the properties of cardiac conduction in a co-culture approach using SCMs and PCMs in cultured cell strands. Murine embryonic SCMs were pooled with fetal ventricular cells and seeded in predefined proportions on microelectrode arrays to form patterned strands of mixed cells. Conduction velocity (CV) was measured during steady state pacing. SCM excitability was estimated from action potentials measured in single cells using the patch clamp technique. Experiments were complemented with computer simulations of conduction using a detailed model of cellular architecture in mixed cell strands. CV was significantly lower in strands composed purely of SCMs (5. 5 ± 1. 5 cm/s, n = 11) as compared to PCMs (34. 9 ± 2. 9 cm/s, n = 21) at similar refractoriness (100 % SCMs: 122 ± 25 ms, n = 9; 100 % PCMs: 139 ± 67 ms, n = 14). In mixed strands combining both cell types, CV was higher than in pure SCMs strands, but always lower than in 100 % PCM strands. Computer simulations demonstrated that both intercellular coupling and electrical excitability limit CV. These data provide evidence that in cultures of murine ventricular cardiomyocytes, SCMs cannot restore CV to control levels resulting in slow conduction, which may lead to reentry circuits and arrhythmias...|$|R

Extending previous results in the literature, we also obtain an explicit realisation of the Virasoro-like symmetry of the PCM, generated by Kn = Ln+ 1 −Ln− 1 for both positive and negative n. We show that these generators obey Sugarawara-type commutation relations String theory is probably the most successful approach to quantum gravity now available, yet there remains much that is not understood about it. In perturbative string theory, one starts by investigating how the string propagates in flat Minkowski spacetime.

40|$|Background: Overdose of {{paracetamol}} (PCM) {{is reported}} to cause hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, or nephrotoxicity in absence of hepatotoxicity. This study was planned to investigate hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity induced by <b>PCM.</b> Methods: Two <b>groups</b> of rabbits, six rabbits in each were used; control group were treated with normal saline, the second group was treated with PCM 1 g/kg/day orally for 9 days. Results: PCM lead to a significant rise in serum liver enzymes, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin {{with an increase in}} serum level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduction in serum glutathione (GSH). MDA level in liver homogenate was also significantly increased. These findings were further confirmed by histopathological changes suggestive of severe liver damage. On the contrary, PCM slightly increased serum creatinine, without changing MDA and GSH in kidney homogenate. Lack of PCM nephrotoxicity was further confirmed by histopathological examination. Conclusion: PCM overdose produced severe hepatotoxicity without affecting the kidneys of the rabbits. [Int J Basic Clin Pharmacol 2014; 3 (6. 000) : 1043 - 1047...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on Mexican manufacturing price cost margins (PCMs) for the period 1994 - 2003. Taking into account the sensitivity of each industry to the speed of the tariff reductions under NAFTA, the results show that PCMs immediately decreased once the second round of trade liberalization in Mexico had commenced in 1994. However, in subsequent years, no clear pattern emerges for these PCMs. Additionally, the paper accounts for the sensitivity of each industry to the initial level of its tariff and presents evidence showing that while NAFTA had an effect on the <b>PCMs</b> of the <b>group</b> of industries that liberalized in 10 years, no robust effect was found for the group of industries that liberalized in 5 years. The results on the group of industries that liberalized in 10 years suggest that NAFTA sharpened competition and exerted market discipline by forcing firms with market power to set prices closer to marginal costs. The findings on the group of industries that liberalized in 5 years suggest that additional factors may be also playing a role in the containment of their market power...|$|R
40|$|A paracoccidioidomicose (PCM) é uma micose sistêmica causada pelo fungo dimórfico Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Está entre as infecções fúngicas mais frequentes da América Latina, sendo o Brasil o país de maior endemicidade, com maior prevalência na região Sudeste. O diagnóstico considerado por muitos autores padrão-ouro para a PCM é o encontro de células fúngicas sugestivas de Paracoccidioides brasiliensis no Exame Microscópico Direto (EMD) de escarro ou outros espécimes clínicos, como raspado de lesão, aspirado de linfonodos, biopsia, etc. As provas sorológicas têm grande importância, complementando ou substituindo o exame micológico no diagnóstico/prognóstico da doença. O objetivo do presente estudo foi comparar dois desses testes sorológicos para PCM: a imunodifusão dupla (IDD) e o ensaio imunoenzimático ELISA. A metodologia foi estabelecida comparando-se títulos de anticorpos obtidos de três grupos de pacientes: 145 amostras de soros de 83 pacientes com PCM (Grupo I), 49 doadores saudáveis (Grupo II) e 13 pacientes com IDD positiva para outras micoses pulmonares: 11 com histoplasmose e 2 com aspergilose (Grupo III). Nossos resultados mostraram que 8 (9, 6 %) e 5 (6, 0 %) dos pacientes com PCM foram falso-negativos ao teste de IDD e ELISA, respectivamente. Dentro do grupo de pacientes saudáveis, não houve casos de falso positivo na IDD, porém, 5 (10, 2 %) amostras foram positivas com títulos baixos no ELISA. Entre os 13 pacientes com outras micoses, o ELISA mostrou que 10 (77, 0 %) foram positivos enquanto a IDD não apresentou qualquer caso de reação cruzada. A sensibilidade do ELISA (93, 9 %) foi um pouco {{superior}} ao da IDD (90, 3 %). A especificidade do ELISA calculada como base o controle saudável e os pacientes com outras micoses foi 89, 7 % e 23, 1 %, respectivamente. A IDD mostrou uma especificidade de 100 % para ambos os casos. Os valores preditivos positivos e negativos foram de 100 % e 83, 8 % para IDD e de 88, 5 % e 90, 3 % para ELISA, respectivamente. A acurácia dos testes também foi calculada: a IDD teve 94, 4 % e o ELISA 86, 2 % de acurácia. Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is {{a systemic}} mycosis {{caused by the}} dimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. It {{is among the most}} common fungal infections in Latin America, with Brazil being the country of highest endemicity, mainly in the Southeast part. The diagnosis considered by many authors as gold standard for the PCM is the finding of suggestive yeast cells of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis in the Direct Microscopic Examination of sputum or other clinical specimens, such as scraping the lesion, lymph node aspirate, biopsy, etc. The serological tests are of great importance, since they complement or replace the mycological examination in the diagnosis / prognosis of the disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare two serological tests for PCM: a double immunodiffusion (IDD) and Enzyme-Linked Immunoabsorbent Assay (ELISA). The methodology was established by comparing antibody titers obtained from three groups of patients: 145 serum samples from 83 patients with <b>PCM</b> (<b>Group</b> I), 49 healthy blood donors (Group II) and 13 patients with IDD positive for other pulmonary mycoses: 11 with histoplasmosis and 2 with aspergillosis (Group III). Our results showed that eight (9. 6 %) and 5 (6. 0 %) of patients with PCM were false negative to the IDD and ELISA tests, respectively. In the group of healthy patients, no cases of false positive in IDD were observed; however, 5 (10. 2 %) of samples were positive with low titers in ELISA. Among the 13 patients with other mycoses, the ELISA showed that 10 (77. 0 %) were positive while the IDD tests did not show any case of cross-reaction. The sensitivity of the ELISA (93. 9 %) was slightly higher than the IDD (90. 3 %). The specificity of the ELISA calculated basing on the healthy control and patients with other mycoses was 89. 7 % and 23. 1 %, respectively. IDD showed 100 % of specificity for both cases. The positive predictive and negative predictive values were 100 % and 83. 8 % for IDD and 88. 5 % and 90. 3 % for ELISA, respectively.

40|$|Although {{tumor-infiltrating}} lymphocytes (TILs) of <b>primary</b> cutaneous melanoma (<b>PCM)</b> include cytolytic T cells able to exert anti-PCM immunity, progression of PCM most frequently occurs, raising {{the hypothesis that}} the PCM microenvironment may also exert suppressive forces, for example, possibly developed by regulatory T (TREG) lymphocytes. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether TILs of PCMs include lymphocytes bearing the transcription factor forkhead box protein P 3 (FOXP 3), which is the TREG lineage specification molecule in mice, and is debated to have a similar role in humans. Fourteen patients with PCM were selected, of which four had radial growth phase (RGP) stage I melanoma, five had vertical growth phase (VGP) stage I melanoma, and five had VGP stage III–IV melanoma. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were utilized for immunohistochemical single and double stainings. TILs of PCMs included FOXP 3 -bearing lymphocytes, which predominantly were CD 20 - and CD 8 -negative, but CD 3 -, CD 4 -, and CD 25 -positive, thus consistent with the standard immunophenotypical characteristics of “natural” TREG cells. Further, the proportions of FOXP 3 -bearing lymphocytes were higher in vertical than in RGP (P= 0. 001), as well as in late than in early melanoma stages (P< 0. 001). Should these FOXP 3 -bearing lymphocytes actually exert regulatory capabilities within the PCM microenvironment, they may suppress “in vivo” the local anti-PCM immune response, thus favoring melanoma progression...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, risk-aware {{cooperative}} spectrum ac-cess {{schemes for}} cognitive radio networks (CRNs) with multiple channels are proposed, whereby multiple primary users (PUs) operating over different channels choose trustworthy secondary users (SUs) as relays to improve throughput, {{and in return}} SUs gain transmission opportunities. To study the multi-channel cooperative spectrum access, cooperation over single channel is investigated first, which involves a PU selecting the suitable SU and granting a period of access time to the selected SU as a reward, considering trustworthiness of SUs. The above procedure is modeled as a Stackelberg game, through which access time allocation and power allocation are obtained. Based on the above results, cooperation over multiple channels is studied {{from the perspectives of}} the primary network and secondary network, respectively. Two schemes are proposed accordingly: the <b>primary</b> network-centric matching (<b>PCM)</b> scheme and the secondary network-centric cluster-based (SCC) scheme. In PCM scheme, cooperating SU for each channel is determined to maximize the total utility of the primary network, which is formulated as a maximum weight matching problem. In SCC scheme, SUs first form a cluster to share the channel state information (CSI), and the best SUs are selected for cooperation with PUs over different channels to obtain the maximum aggregate access time for the secondary network. Then, SUs share the obtained resource using congestion game and quadrature signalling. Numerical results demonstrate that, with the proposed schemes, PUs can achieve higher throughput, while SUs can obtain longer average access time, compared with the random channel access approach.

40|$|The Fuel Retrieval System (FRS) Process Validation Procedure (Shen 1999) {{requires}} that a specified quantity of fuel processed through the <b>Primary</b> Cleaning Machine (<b>PCM)</b> be inspected for cleanliness during initial operational and process validation testing. Specifically, these inspections are performed {{to confirm that}} the PCM adequately cleans the fuel elements of canister sludge. The results of these inspections will be used to demonstrate that residual quantities of canister particulate on fuel elements loaded into Multi-Canister Overpacks (MCOs) are within projected levels used to establish safety basis limits (Sloughter 1998). The fuel inspections performed as part of the validation process will be conducted during the Hot Operations portion of the Phased Startup Initiative (PSI) of the Fuel Retrieval and Integrated Water Treatment Systems (Pajunen 1999). Hot Operations testing constitutes Phases 3 and 4 of the PSI. The fuel assemblies in all candidate canisters will be thoroughly inspected during these test phases (highly degraded fuel assemblies are exempt from inspection). During subsequent production operation of the FRS, only periodic (every tenth canister) inspections for cleanliness will be performed and documented. This document describes the specific processes and techniques that will be applied in performing the cleanliness inspections, and the methodology used to verify that the documented inspection results conform to Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) requirements.

40|$|ABSTRACT Sentinel {{lymph node}} biopsy (SLNB) is an {{established}} method {{for the assessment of}} tumor aggressiveness in patients with <b>primary</b> cutaneous melanoma (<b>PCM).</b> To improve the criteria for the selection of SLNB candidates, the aim of our study was to determine clinico-pathohistological parameters that can serve as predictors of metastatic progression. We retrospectively evaluated all available clinico-pathohistological parameters in 844 patients with PCM diagnosed between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2010. SLNB was conducted in 484 (57. 3 %) patients, 122 (14. 5 %) of whom had a positive node. The association between predictors and SLNB outcomes (positive SLNB and metastatic development) was tested using logistic regression analysis. The main predictors of positive SLNB were Breslow thickness (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1. 22; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 11 - 1. 33), Clark levels (AOR= 1. 78; 95 % CI= 1. 31 - 2. 40), ulceration (AOR= 3. 1; 95 % CI= 1. 65 - 5. 81), microsatellitosis, gender, and tumor localization. The predictors of metastatic spread were Breslow thickness (AOR= 1, 69; 95 % CI= 1. 51 - 1. 89), Clark level (AOR= 3. 59; 95 % CI= 2. 79 - 4. 62), nodular type of melanoma (AOR= 8. 21; 95 % CI= 1. 70 - 39. 53), ulceration, mitotic rate, microsatellitosis, gender, and tumor localization. It seems that these parameters should be taken into consideration when selecting patients for SLNB since tumor thickness is not a sufficient predictor of SLNB outcome, particularly in case of very thin lesions.   KEY WORDS: primary cutaneous melanoma (PCM); sentinel {{lymph node biopsy}} (SLNB); metastases...|$|R

Background: Overweight {{and obesity}} contributed {{approximately}} $ 147 billion to national medical expenses in the United States in 2008. There are many overweight and obese active duty service members (ADSMs) or airmen in United States Air Force (USAF). The USAF leadership’s goal at Robins Air Force Base (RAFB) {{is to have}} <b>primary</b> care managers (<b>PCM)</b> to routinely screen airmen for their body mass index (BMI) and refer them to the Health and Wellness Center (HAWC). The objective of this initiative {{is to improve the}} percentage rate of screening and referrals documented with a statistically significant improvement after three months. Methods: The Iowa Model guided the implementation of evidence-based practice (EBP) practice. Data was collected from 1 May to 31 July 2013 and 1 May to 31 July 2014. The posters in the patient care rooms served as reminders. Six providers worked with twelve medical technicians (MTs) in the family health clinic (FHC) who measured heights and weights of ADSMs at every patient visit. The electronic medical record (EMR) automatically calculated the BMIs. The providers diagnosed airmen with overweight or obesity and they ordered referrals in the EMR. Outcomes: Statistically significant changes were found in 2014 compared to 2013 for the older obese ADSMs in the age 30 to 64 year group for males and females; 48. 3 % vs 21. 4 %, p< 0. 5 and 66. 7 % vs 36 %, p< 0. 5, respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} socioeconomic status (SES) on Breslow thickness, disease-free survival, and overall survival in patients with stage I-II <b>primary</b> cutaneous melanoma (<b>PCM).</b> PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study consists of all consecutive patients who were diagnosed as having PCM and were treated and followed up at our hospital between November 1, 1998, and July 31, 2009. Pathologic and sociodemographic characteristics of the patients were obtained. We categorized SES into 3 levels: low (manual employees and skilled/unskilled workers, including farmers, with primary education level), middle (nonmanual employees and clerks with middle education level), and high (professionals, executives, administrators, and entrepreneurs with tertiary education). RESULTS: A total of 1443 consecutive patients were evaluated. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, sex (female vs male: odds ratio [OR], 1. 37; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 08 - 1. 75), SES (high vs middle: OR, 1. 27; 95 % CI, 0. 96 - 1. 69; high vs low: OR, 1. 73; 95 % CI, 1. 26 - 2. 38), age (< 60 vs ≥ 60 years: OR, 1. 35; 95 % CI, 1. 03 - 1. 78), and family context (single vs living with relatives: OR, 1. 37; 95 % CI, 0. 97 - 1. 94) were the strongest correlates of Breslow thickness. Compared with high SES, the risk of melanoma-related death, adjusted for age and sex, was 7 times higher (hazard ratio, 7. 44; 95 % CI, 3. 27 - 16. 93) and almost 2 times higher (hazard ratio, 1. 88; 95 % CI, 1. 04 - 3. 39) in patients with low SES living alone or living with relatives, respectively.
