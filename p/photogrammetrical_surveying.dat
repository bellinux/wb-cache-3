40|$|The {{main room}} of the Valentino Castle in Torino, the "Salone delle Feste", was {{conceived}} and realised in the XVIIth century {{under the guidance of}} Carlo di Castellamonte. The beautiful frescos and stuccoes of the domical vault are sus- tained by a typical Delorne carpentry, whose span is among the largest of their kind. The dome suffered from degradation dur- ing the years, and a series of interventions were put into place. Nowadays, a survey revealed that the suspender cables above the vault in the region close to the abutments have lost their tension. This may indicate an increase of the vault deformation; therefore a structural assessment of the dome is mandatory. In order to reinforce the structural hypothesis of damages and to reveal the deformation effects, a high detailed metric survey have been carried out with integrated laser scanning and digital close range photogrammetry. The <b>photogrammetrical</b> <b>survey</b> of frescos, with the re-projection of images on vault surface model (texture mapping), is purposed to exactly local- ize formers restoration and their signs on frescos continuity. The present paper illustrates the generation of the 3 D high-resolution model and its relations with the results of the structural survey; both of them support the Finite Element numerical simulation of the dome. Finally, possible intervention techniques are mentioned, accounting for the restoration criteria of reversibility, mini- mum intervention, sustainability and compatibility...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} explores the {{relationship}} between the new frontiers of architectural survey and architectural restoration. The result is a project for the reassembly of the Altar of the Holy Heart of Mary in the Cathedral of Gerace, in the province of Reggio Calabria. It was dismantled in the last century with the purpose to restore the “solemn and sober aspect” of the church during the medieval age. The idea was born in the sphere of a multidisciplinary didactic experience, which involved history, conservation, digital modelling, design and enhancement of cultural heritage. The process, from analyses to project, followed four steps: realization of a systematic <b>photogrammetrical</b> <b>survey</b> of each architectural element of the 18 th century altars of the cathedral, which were dismantled in the last century, with high precision photomodelling techniques; early identification of the single objects, positioning structured QR-CODE with metadata and short description directly in the shooting phase; pre-cataloguing phase, implemented by the compilation of single cards regarding each piece, using a redrafted version of the ICCD OA card (artwork 3. 00 version); a proposal for the reassembly of the altar of the Holy Heart of Mary. The reassembly is conceived {{as an alternative to the}} reconstruction of the altar “as it was”, using a steel structure that is partially visible, which was studied to support and “exhibit” the marble pieces. The availability of numerical models for each piece facilitated, on one side, weight distribution analysis and, consequently, correct dimensioning of the support structure and, on the other side, interactive simulation processes for design optimisation and aesthetic evaluation...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} some reflexions concerning {{an interdisciplinary}} project between Medieval Archaeologists from the University of Florence (Italy) and ICT researchers from CNRS LSIS of Marseille (France), aiming towards {{a connection between}} 3 D spatial representation and archaeological knowledge. It {{is well known that}} Laser Scanner, Photogrammetry and Computer Vision are very attractive tools for archaeologists, although the integration of representation of space and representation of archaeological time has not yet found a methodological standard of reference. We try to develop an integrated system for archaeological 3 D survey and all other types of archaeological data and knowledge through integrating observable (material) and non-graphic (interpretive) data. Survey plays a central role, since it is both a metric representation of the archaeological site and, to a wider extent, an interpretation of it (being also a common basis for communication between the 2 teams). More specifically 3 D survey is crucial, allowing archaeologists to connect actual spatial assets to the stratigraphic formation processes (i. e. to the archaeological time) and to translate spatial observations into historical interpretation of the site. We propose a common formalism for describing <b>photogrammetrical</b> <b>survey</b> and archaeological knowledge stemming from ontologies: Indeed, ontologies are fully used to model and store 3 D data and archaeological knowledge. Xe equip this formalism with a qualitative representation of time. Stratigraphic analyses (both of excavated deposits and of upstanding structures) are closely related to E. C. Harris theory of “Stratigraphic Unit” (“US” from now on). Every US is connected to the others by geometric, topological and, eventually, temporal links, and are recorded by the 3 D photogrammetric survey. However, the limitations of the Harris Matrix approach lead to use another representation formalism for stratigraphic relationships, namely Qualitative Constraints Networks (QCN) successfully used in the domain of knowledge representation and reasoning in artificial intelligence for representing temporal relations...|$|R

40|$|ARPENTEUR is a web {{application}} for digital photogrammetry mainly dedicated to architecture (Architectural PhotogrammEtry Network Tool for EdUcation and Research) available at http ://www. arpenteur. net. ARPENTEUR {{has been developed}} by two complementary research teams: the “Photogrammetry and Geomatics” group of ENSAIS- LERGEC's laboratory (Strasbourg, France) and the Gamsau-MAP CNRS laboratory located {{in the school of}} Architecture of Marseilles (France). This paper focuses on a new approach of stone-by-stone surveying in which formalised architectural knowledge is used as a prerequisite to the photogrammetric measurement process. In addition to this morphological definition, the structure point of view is implemented in the model in order to consider some architectural elements as containing a set of ashlar blocks. In our approach of stone-by-stone surveying, which has been conceived for the study of historical ashlar masonry but can be applied to other types of investigation, the measurement is performed directly on each individual stone in its built context. A previous edifice analysis, conducted by an archaeologist, is necessary to define the construction characteristics and chronology, and the properties of all the measured architectural entities. This results in the definition of an approximate depth for each type of stone, allowing a limited survey to the blocks visible part. An extrusion vector is computed in order to inform lacking geometrical description of the block. Once the instanced block is measured a polyhedron representation of its morphology is generated. The instance is also added to a data structure in which it is positioned according to topological or geometrical order. The result is therefore a collection of ordered blocks that includes, for instance, for each block data on its neighbours (adjacent blocks). When completed, the tool will create a direct link between the architectural object and the database, enabling to locate and thus identify the properties of each block registered in the database. The possibilities of this new type of approach to architecture extend from archaeology to restoration and maintenance to any type of structure treated by <b>photogrammetrical</b> <b>survey.</b> Retrieving architectural information (for example the intrados radius of an arch) is the approach we have developed in architectural surveying. We are currently working on giving this possibility in the stone-by-stone surveying process on which this paper focuses...|$|R
