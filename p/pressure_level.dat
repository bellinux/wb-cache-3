5|$|The Mac Pro's Xeon {{processors}} generated {{much less}} heat {{than the previous}} dual-core G5s, so {{the size of the}} internal cooling devices were reduced significantly. This allowed the interior to be re-arranged, leaving more room {{at the top of the}} case and doubling the number of internal drive bays. This also allowed the elimination of the large clear plastic air deflector used as part of the cooling system in the Power Mac G5. Less heat also meant less air to move out of the case for cooling during normal operations; the Mac Pro was very quiet in normal operation, quieter than the much noisier Power Mac G5, and proved difficult to measure using common sound <b>pressure</b> <b>level</b> meters.|$|E
5|$|Subwoofers use speaker drivers (woofers) {{typically}} between 8-inch (20cm) and 21-inch (53cm) in diameter. Some uncommon subwoofers use larger drivers, {{and single}} prototype subwoofers {{as large as}} 60-inch (152cm) have been fabricated. On the smaller end of the spectrum, subwoofer drivers as small as 4-inch (10cm) may be used. Small subwoofer drivers in the 4-inch range are typically used in small computer speaker systems and compact home theatre subwoofer cabinets. The size of the driver and number of drivers in a cabinet depends {{on the design of}} the loudspeaker enclosure, the size of the cabinet, the desired sound <b>pressure</b> <b>level,</b> the lowest frequency targeted and the level of permitted distortion. The most common subwoofer driver sizes used for sound reinforcement in nightclubs, raves and pop/rock concerts are 10-, 12-, 15- and 18-inch models (25cm, 30cm, 38cm, and 45cm respectively). The largest available sound reinforcement subwoofers, 21-inch (53cm) drivers, are less commonly seen.|$|E

Most of these measurements require sophisticated and often expensive equipment to perform, and also good judgment by the operator, but the raw sound <b>pressure</b> <b>level</b> output is rather easier to report and so is often the only specified value—sometimes in misleadingly exact terms.

40|$|Background: Although {{numerous}} genetic {{studies have}} been performed, only 0. 9 % of blood pressure phenotypic variance has been elucidated. This phenomenon could be partially due to epistatic interactions. Our aim was to identify epistatic interaction(s) associated with blood <b>pressure</b> <b>levels</b> in a pre-planned two-phase approach. Methods and Results: In a discovery cohort composed of 3, 600 French individuals, we found rs 6046 A allele in F 7 associated with decreased blood <b>pressure</b> <b>levels</b> (P# 3. 761023) and rs 5355 T allele in SELE associated with decreased diastolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>levels</b> (P = 561023). Both variants interacted in order to influence blood <b>pressure</b> <b>levels</b> (P# 0. 048). This interaction was replicated with systolic blood pressure in 4, 620 additional European individuals (P = 0. 03). Similarly, in this replication cohort, rs 6046 A was associated with decreased blood <b>pressure</b> <b>levels</b> (P# 8. 561024). Furthermore, in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} of a subsample of 90 supposed healthy individuals, we found rs 6046 A positively associated with NAMPT mRNA levels (P# 9. 161025), suggesting an eventual involvement of NAMPT expression in blood pressure regulation. Confirming this hypothesis, further transcriptomic analyses showed that increased NAMPT mRNA levels were positively correlated with ICAM 1, SELL, FPR 1, DEFA 1 - 3, and LL- 37 genes expression (P# 561023). The last two mRNA levels were positively associated with systolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>levels</b> (P# 0. 01) and explained 4 % of its phenotypic variation.

25|$|It {{has been}} shown that a cuff with a wider bladder occludes blood flow at a lower <b>pressure</b> <b>level</b> than a cuff with a {{narrower}} bladder. This may be related to more efficient pressure transmission to the deeper tissues with a wider cuff. Lower pressures, and associated lower pressure gradients, may reduce the risk of pressure-related injuries to the patient. Furthermore, Estebe et. al demonstrated that a wide tourniquet cuff is less painful than a narrow cuff if inflated at lower pressures and at these lower pressures it is still effective at occluding blood flow.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, baroreceptors are stretch receptors {{located in}} the aortic sinus, carotid bodies, the venae cavae, and other locations, {{including}} pulmonary vessels and {{the right side of}} the heart itself. Rates of firing from the baroreceptors represent blood <b>pressure,</b> <b>level</b> of physical activity, and the relative distribution of blood. The cardiac centers monitor baroreceptor firing to maintain cardiac homeostasis, a mechanism called the baroreceptor reflex. With increased pressure and stretch, the rate of baroreceptor firing increases, and the cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation and increase parasympathetic stimulation. As pressure and stretch decrease, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases, and the cardiac centers increase sympathetic stimulation and decrease parasympathetic stimulation.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Obesity {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an independent risk factor for arterial hypertension. DESIGN: This study was addressed to identify parameters predictive of 24 -h mean systolic and/or diastolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>levels</b> in obesity. METHODS: A cohort of 180 euthyroid overweight and obese patients, 79 women and 101 men, aged 20 - 63 years, normotensive (n[*]=[*] 62) or with recently developed hypertension (n[*]=[*] 118), and never treated with antihypertensive drugs, was examined. Waist circumference, fasting insulin, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT) FT(3), FT(4), glucose, and lipid (cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride) serum concentrations, and 24 -h urinary aldosterone and catecholamines were measured. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed and hypertension was confirmed when 24 -h mean systolic blood pressure was ≥ 125 [*]mmHg and/or 24 -h mean diastolic blood pressure was ≥ 80 [*]mmHg, according to the 2007 European Society of Hypertension and European Society of Cardiology Practice Guidelines for the Management of Arterial Hypertension. RESULTS: 24 -h noradrenaline (p[*]<[*] 0. 01) and adrenaline (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) levels were higher in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects. The odds ratio (OR) was determined by several univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to evaluate the predictive factors of high 24 -h blood pressure mean values. When subjects with high systolic and/or high diastolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>levels</b> (n[*]=[*] 118) were compared to individuals with normal systolic and diastolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>levels</b> (n[*]=[*] 62), multivariate analysis showed an independent association of hypertension with male gender and 24 -h noradrenaline levels. When subjects with high systolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>levels</b> (n[*]=[*] 108) were compared with those with normal systolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>levels</b> (n[*]=[*] 72), multivariate analysis showed an independent association of high systolic blood <b>pressure</b> with noradrenaline <b>levels.</b> Lastly, when subjects with high diastolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>levels</b> (n[*]=[*] 87) were compared with those with normal diastolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>levels</b> (n[*]=[*] 93), multivariate analysis showed an independent negative association between high diastolic blood pressure and body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: the present study shows that diastolic blood pressure is independently and negatively associated with body mass index in normotensive or with recently discovered hypertension overweight and obese subjects, and never treated with antihypertensive drugs. These results suggest that obesity per se is responsible for a decrease in diastolic blood pressure before hypertensive state becomes stable.
