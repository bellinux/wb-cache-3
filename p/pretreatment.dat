Three different types of <b>pretreatments</b> were performed: heat treatment, heat treatment after high-pressure treatment and high-pressure treatment after heat treatment.

40|$|Purpose– The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the effect of heat adaptation, pH adjustment, and the {{combination}} <b>pretreatments</b> to the resistance ofLactobacillus paracaseiSNP 2 in heat shock and spray drying. Design/methodology/approach– Sub-lethal and lethal temperature range of L. paracasei SNP 2 was determined by enumeration of cell survival after incubation at 37 - 55 °C for 30 min. A certain temperature from sub-lethal range was selected for heat adaptation. Heat adaptation (H), pH adjustment (pH), and combination of <b>pretreatments</b> (pH-H) were applied prior to heat shock and spray drying. Findings– The selected condition for heat adaptation and heat shock is 44 °C, 30 min and 55 °C, 15 min, respectively, based on the sub-lethal and lethal temperature range. By heat shock, cells in the whey-sucrose medium showed cell death of 2. 05 log cycles, lower than cell death in the MRS medium of 4. 84 log cycles. The <b>pretreatments</b> showed slight increase of heat resistance in cell grown in whey sucrose. The effect of H, pH, and pH-H <b>pretreatments</b> highly increase heat resistance of cell grown in MRS indicated by cell death of 4. 27, 3. 79, and 2. 43 log cycles, respectively, which is much lower than control. The <b>pretreatments</b> showed no significant effect toL. paracaseiSNP 2 survival to spray drying.
