5|$|Epstein asked {{chartered}} accountant James Trevor Isherwood {{to set up}} a company to collect Lennon and McCartney's PRS payments—called Lenmac—which he did on 12 May 1964. When he first visited Epstein's office, Isherwood was surprised to learn that Epstein took 25 per cent of the gross income, and not the 10 per cent that he believed most other managers received at that time. All of Epstein's expenses were deducted from his artists' gross income, including office rental, staff wages, travel, telephone costs, and entertaining expenses. Before his death, Epstein knew that the renegotiation of his management contract (up for renewal on 30 September 1967), would lower his management fee from 25 to 10 per cent, and that NEMS would no longer receive a share of the Beatles' <b>performance</b> <b>fees,</b> reducing its revenues still further.|$|E
25|$|The {{performance}} fee is typically 20% of the fund's profits during any year, though they range between 10% and 50%. <b>Performance</b> <b>fees</b> {{are intended to}} provide an incentive for a manager to generate profits. <b>Performance</b> <b>fees</b> have been criticized by Warren Buffett, who believes that because hedge funds share only the profits and not the losses, such fees create an incentive for high-risk investment management. Performance fee rates have fallen {{since the start of}} the credit crunch.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that hedge funds are sufficiently diversifying to merit inclusion in investor portfolios, but this is disputed for example by Mark Kritzman who performed a mean-variance optimization calculation on an opportunity set that consisted of a stock index fund, a bond index fund, and ten hypothetical hedge funds. The optimizer found that a mean-variance efficient portfolio did not contain any allocation to hedge funds, largely because of the impact of <b>performance</b> <b>fees.</b> To demonstrate this, Kritzman repeated the optimization using an assumption that the hedge funds incurred no <b>performance</b> <b>fees.</b> The result from this second optimization was an allocation of 74% to hedge funds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to give the}} investors a better {{understanding}} on how to interpret the costs of funds with <b>performance</b> <b>fee</b> with high-water mark and give some guidelines when comparing funds with different fee structures, i. e. mutual funds and hedge funds. Mathematical approaches – Two mathematical approaches are used in the study. The first approach is to describe the high-water mark contract as a partial differential equation, which has the characteristics of Black-Scholes equation. The second approach is to numerically simulate the evolution of a fund’s value. During the development of the fund’s value the cost of the fees are calculated and discounted. Findings – It is found that the expected cost of the <b>performance</b> <b>fee</b> with high-water mark, vary a lot. An example is when the volatility increases the expected cost of <b>performance</b> <b>fee</b> drastically raises while the management fee is unchanged. Another interesting finding is that the order of when the fees’ are charged affects the expected cost of the <b>performance</b> <b>fee.</b> Conclusion – The guidelines for the investor is to invest in a fund with a <b>performance</b> <b>fee</b> in low volatile markets and a fund with just the management fee in high volatile markets. Another impact is the time step which the high-water mark level is controlled. The investor wants these controls as infrequently as possible. If the controls are done at a daily basis the expected cost of the <b>performance</b> <b>fee</b> is higher than in a monthly control. It is also concluded that the Normanbelopp of a fund with a <b>performance</b> <b>fee</b> should not be trusted. Key-words:...|$|R

25|$|World Class (formerly Division I) corps are {{the groups}} that have chosen to compete {{at the highest level}} and have proven to DCI {{leadership}} they have the ability to survive at this level both competitively and financially. The higher a corps is ranked at the DCI Championships, the higher the <b>performance</b> <b>fees</b> they will earn for the following season's performances.|$|E
25|$|It {{was later}} renamed as the Quantum Fund, {{named after the}} {{physical}} theory of quantum mechanics. By that time {{the value of the}} fund had grown to $12m, only a small proportion of which was Soros's own money. He and Jim Rogers reinvested their returns from the fund, and also a large part of their 20% <b>performance</b> <b>fees,</b> thereby expanding their stake.|$|E
25|$|Some {{hedge funds}} charge a {{redemption}} fee (or withdrawal fee) for early withdrawals during a specified {{period of time}} (typically a year) or when withdrawals exceed a predetermined percentage of the original investment. The purpose of the fee is to discourage short-term investing, reduce turnover and deter withdrawals after periods of poor performance. Unlike management fees and <b>performance</b> <b>fees,</b> redemption fees are usually kept by the fund.|$|E
5000|$|The highest NAV of a fund to date {{is known}} as the [...] "high water mark". If the NAV of a fund declines during a year, no <b>performance</b> <b>fee</b> will be payable to the {{investment}} manager. If the NAV subsequently increases over the following year back to the high-water mark (but no higher), it would be objectionable for the investor to be charged a <b>performance</b> <b>fee</b> on that increase because the investor has not yet made any return on its investment. Therefore, to address this concern, hedge funds will typically only charge a <b>performance</b> <b>fee</b> on increases in NAV over the high-water mark. This also applies to mutual funds though variably.|$|R

25|$|Herbert led a {{group of}} composers and {{publishers}} in founding the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) on February 13, 1914, becoming its vice-president and director {{until his death in}} 1924. The organization has historically worked {{to protect the rights of}} songwriters and music publishers and continues to do this work today. In 1917, Herbert won a landmark lawsuit before the United States Supreme Court that gave composers, through ASCAP, a right to charge <b>performance</b> <b>fees</b> for the public performance of their music. ASCAP commissioned a statue in Herbert's honor in New York City's Central Park, erected in 1927.|$|E
25|$|Hedge fund {{management}} {{firms are}} usually owned by their portfolio managers, who are therefore entitled to any profits {{that the business}} makes. As management fees are intended to cover the firm's operating costs, <b>performance</b> <b>fees</b> (and any excess management fees) are generally distributed to the firm's owners as profits. Funds do not tend to report compensation and so published lists of the amounts earned by top managers tend to be estimates based on {{factors such as the}} fees charged by their funds and the capital they are thought to have invested in them. Many managers have accumulated large stakes in their own funds and so top hedge fund managers can earn extraordinary amounts of money, perhaps up to $4 billion in a good year.|$|E
500|$|In March 2010, Yoshiki filed {{a lawsuit}} against Nexstar Corporation, for 375 million yen in damages. The band's {{contract}} with the company included the use of recordings, the initial deal was for 600 million yen in advance royalties and contract money, which the band claims not to have received. Between 2008 and 2009, the company also sponsored several concerts around Asia and Japan, not having paid <b>performance</b> <b>fees</b> and merchandise sales to X Japan. In all, the total unpaid amount is more than 900 million yen. The lawsuit sought only 375 million yen for the revenue earned from the concerts, with an additional claim of 600 million yen in case the trial proceeded. Yoshiki's side eventually won the lawsuit in 2014, where the Tokyo District Court ordered Nexstar to pay 660 million yen in damages.|$|E
5000|$|While {{this article}} {{uses the term}} [...] "NAV" [...] for simplicity, in reality a <b>performance</b> <b>fee</b> would be charged by {{reference}} to the NAV per share (being the net asset value divided {{by the number of}} shares in issue). The NAV will fluctuate as investors subscribe for and redeem shares, whereas the NAV per share will only fluctuate as the underlying investments increase or decrease in value, making the latter the appropriate measure for calculating a <b>performance</b> <b>fee.</b>|$|R
50|$|A hurdle, in {{the context}} of a <b>performance</b> <b>fee,</b> is a level of return that the fund must beat before it can charge a <b>performance</b> <b>fee.</b> It may be a set {{percentage}} or it may be referenced to an index. The index would typically be either LIBOR (or an equivalent) or an index reflecting the underlying market in which the fund is investing. The purpose of the latter is to reward the fund for generating returns that are better than the market (alpha) rather than for returns generated simply by movement in the market as a whole.|$|R

500|$|Performances in Florida, {{which has}} a large Cuban exile and Cuban American community, were rare {{after the release of}} the film due to the {{political}} climate. In the late 1990s, a concert by Cuban jazz pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba turned into a near riot when concert goers were attacked and spat at by protesters opposed to the Cuban government. When [...] "Buena Vista" [...] musicians played for a music industry conference at Miami Beach in 1998, hundreds of protesters chanted outside and the convention center hall was cleared briefly because of a bomb threat. In 1999, Ferrer and Ruben González were forced to cancel Miami shows citing fears for their safety after fellow-Cubans Los Van Van drew 4,000 protesters at a previous show, and Compay Segundo was forced to cut short a 1999 Miami performance due to another bomb threat. When touring the U.S., the Cubans are only entitled to their per diem (transportation and lodging) and are not permitted <b>performance</b> <b>fees</b> due to the U.S. embargo. [...] In 2001 a Buena Vista Social Club (with Ibrahim Ferrer) performance was recorded in Austin for PBS and broadcast on Austin City Limits in 2002.|$|E
2500|$|Earnings at {{the very}} top are higher than in any other sector of the {{financial}} industry [...] and collectively the top 25 hedge fund managers regularly earn more than all 500 of the chief executives in the S 500. Most hedge fund managers are remunerated much less, however, and if <b>performance</b> <b>fees</b> are not earned then small managers at least are unlikely to be paid significant amounts.|$|E
2500|$|Almost all {{hedge fund}} <b>{{performance}}</b> <b>fees</b> include a [...] "high water mark" [...] (or [...] "loss carryforward provision"), {{which means that}} the performance fee only applies to net profits (i.e., profits after losses in previous years have been recovered). This prevents managers from receiving fees for volatile performance, though a manager will sometimes close a fund that has suffered serious losses and start a new fund, rather than attempting to recover the losses {{over a number of years}} without performance fee.|$|E

40|$|Under the principal-agent framework, {{we study}} and compare {{different}} compensation schemes commonly adopted by hedge fund and mutual fund managers. We {{find that the}} option-like <b>performance</b> <b>fee</b> structure prevalent among hedge funds is suboptimal to the symmetric <b>performance</b> <b>fee</b> struc-ture. However, the use of high water mark (HWM) mitigates the subop-timality, though to a very limited extent. Both our theoretical models and simulation results show that HWM will induce more managerial efforts only when a fund is slightly under the water but it will unfavorably dampen incen-tives when a fund is too deep under the water and when the manager’s skill is poor. Allowing managers to invest personal wealth in their own funds, how-ever, helps align interests and provides positive managerial incentives...|$|R

2500|$|The 1981 season {{opened with}} NYGASP's {{celebration of the}} Patience centenary in April 1981 (hosted by Asimov). [...] In the fall of 1981, NYGASP began touring its {{productions}} along the U.S. East Coast {{in addition to its}} short New York seasons. [...] By the early 1980s, NYGASP paid <b>performance</b> <b>fees</b> not only to principal singers, but also to choristers. [...] The company was able to attract an increased level of contributions, including annual grants from the New York State Council on the Arts. [...] By the mid-1980s, NYGASP had attracted an independent Board of Directors to assist with fund raising and risk management.|$|E
2500|$|Some <b>{{performance}}</b> <b>fees</b> {{include a}} [...] "hurdle", {{so that a}} fee is only paid on the fund's performance in excess of a benchmark rate (e.g. LIBOR) or a fixed percentage. A [...] "soft" [...] hurdle means the performance fee is calculated on all the fund's returns if the hurdle rate is cleared. A [...] "hard" [...] hurdle is calculated only on returns above the hurdle rate. A hurdle is intended {{to ensure that a}} manager is only rewarded if the fund generates returns in excess of the returns that the investor would have received if they had invested their money elsewhere.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{hedge fund}} {{investment}} strategies aim {{to achieve a}} positive return on investment regardless of whether markets are rising or falling ("absolute return"). Hedge fund managers often invest money of their own in the fund they manage. A hedge fund typically pays its investment manager an annual management fee (for example 2% of {{the assets of the}} fund), and a performance fee (for example 20% of the increase in the fund's net asset value during the year). Both co-investment and <b>performance</b> <b>fees</b> serve to align the interests of managers with those of the investors in the fund.

2500|$|Bergeret was ambitious, and {{he wanted}} his company to grow and become fully professional. [...] In May 1979, NYGASP hired its first 25-piece {{orchestra}} and began to pay <b>performance</b> <b>fees</b> to principal singers {{as the level of}} professionalism of its cast continued to increase. [...] NYGASP scored a publicity coup on October 28, 1979, when pictures of the cast performing excerpts from Pinafore on the Staten Island Ferry were displayed in the Sunday New York Times and the New York Daily News. [...] The company expanded its audience further at Symphony Space as it celebrated the centennials of the G operas there, beginning with The Pirates of Penzance in 1979, eventually performing all of the extant Savoy operas. [...] NYGASP attracted such loyal fans and supporters as writer Isaac Asimov and began to gain favorable and frequent reviews in the New York Times and the Daily News, among others.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1895, to {{help improve}} his {{depleting}} finances, Rachmaninoff agreed to a three-month concert tour across Russia with a program shared by Teresina Tua, an Italian violinist. He did not enjoy the experience, and quit the tour early while sacrificing his <b>performance</b> <b>fees</b> which caused him to pawn his watch {{given to him by}} Zverev. In September 1895, before the tour started, Rachmaninoff completed his Symphony No. 1 (Op.13), a work conceived in January based on chants heard in Russian Orthodox church services. He worked so hard on the piece, he could not settle himself into composing again until he heard the piece performed. However, Rachmaninoff had to resume work in October 1896 in order to recoup his losses after [...] "a rather large sum of money" [...] that was not his, was stolen during a train journey. Among these were included Six Choruses for Women's or Children's Voices (Op. 15) and Moments Musicaux (Op. 16), his final completed composition for several months.|$|E
2500|$|Cartoonist Al Capp, {{creator of}} the comic strip Li'l Abner, satirized Baez as [...] "Joanie Phoanie" [...] during the 1960s.
