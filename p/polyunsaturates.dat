Aim: To explore <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids balance and its interplay with platelet oxidative stress in liver cirrhosis. Methods: A cross-sectional study in 51 cirrhotic patients and sex- and age-matched controls was performed. Serum <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids and oxidative stress markers (urinary isoprostanes and serum soluble NADPH-oxidase- 2 -derived peptide) were measured. The effect on platelet oxidative stress of n- 6 /n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids ratio in vitro and in vivo (1 -week supplementation with 3 g/daily n- 3 -polyunsaturated fatty acids) was tested. Results: Compared to controls, cirrhotic patients had significantly higher n- 6 /n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids ratio. n- 6 /n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids ratio correlated significantly with disease severity and oxidative stress markers. In vitro experiments showed that in Child-Pugh C patients' platelets incubation with low n- 6 /n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids ratio resulted in dose-dependent decrease of radical oxigen species (- 39 %), isoprostanes (- 25 %) and NADPH-oxidase- 2 regulation (- 51 %). n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids supplemented patients showed significant oxidative stress indexes reduction. Conclusions: In cirrhosis, n- 6 /n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids imbalance up-regulates platelet NADPH-oxidase- 2 with ensuing oxidative stress.

40|$|The {{physiological}} {{bases for}} roles of adipose tissue and fatty acids in the symptoms and dietary treatments of Crohn's disease are poorly understood. The hypothesis developed from experiments on rodents that perinodal adipocytes are specialized to provision adjacent lymphoid tissues was tested {{by comparing the}} composition of triacylglycerol fatty acids in homologous samples of mesenteric adipose tissue and lymph nodes from patients with or without Crohn's disease. Mesenteric perinodal and other adipose tissue, and lymph nodes, were collected during elective surgery for Crohn's disease and other conditions. Fatty acids were extracted, identified, and quantified by thin-layer and gas-liquid chromatography. Perinodal adipose tissue contained more unsaturated fatty acids than other adipose tissue in controls, as reported for other mammals, but site-specific differences were absent in Crohn's disease. Lipids from adipose and lymphoid tissues had more saturated fatty acids, but fewer <b>polyunsaturates</b> in Crohn's disease patients than controls. In adipose tissue samples, depletion of n- 3 <b>polyunsaturates</b> was greatest, but n- 6 <b>polyunsaturates,</b> particularly arachidonic acid, were preferentially reduced in lymphoid cells. Ratios of n- 6 /n- 3 <b>polyunsaturates</b> were higher in adipose tissue but lower in lymphoid cells in Crohn's disease patients than in controls.

Limousin cows had more palmitate, vaccenate, arachidonate, and less gamma-linolenate and eicosapentanoate than Jersey cows. Age differences were significant: proportions of palmitate, stearate, and oleate decreased and linoleate, arachidonate, and total <b>polyunsaturates</b> increased with age. Most of the breed x age interactions were not significant. Also, phospholipids of Jersey and Limousin cows {{did not differ in}} total saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Currently, however, evaluation of the effectiveness of this approach requires invasive blood sampling or post mortem tissue sampling of the birds.

Male and female meat chickens (Cobb 500) were fed a diet supplemented with 4 % (w/w) flaxseed oil (high n- 3 <b>polyunsaturates)</b> or beef tallow (mostly monounsaturates and saturates) for 6 weeks. Preen oil and whole blood samples (n = 9 birds per sex/diet treatment group) were collected freshly post mortem for fatty acid analysis. Preen oil analysis showed that ~ 97 % of fatty acids were saturates, with a small percentage of n- 6 <b>polyunsaturates</b> and traces of other types. There were negligible n- 3 <b>polyunsaturates</b> in preen oil. Proportions of some saturated fatty acids were slightly, but significantly, affected by diet (C 16 : 0 (P < 0. 05) and C 17 : 0 (P < 0. 01)) or by gender (C 10 : 0 and C 18 : 0) (P < 0. 05). Some fatty acids with odd numbers of carbon atoms (e. g. C 17 : 0 and C 19 : 0) were found in relatively high concentrations in preen oil, despite not being detectable in either the diet or blood. In conclusion, the fatty acid composition of preen oil does not accurately reflect the fatty acid profile of the blood; it is not, therefore, a suitable alternative for determining fatty acid status of meat chickens.

40|$|The acyl {{composition}} of membrane phospholipids in kidney and brain of mammals of different body mass was examined.

The {{results of this study}} supported both hypotheses. Differences in membrane phospholipid acyl composition (i. e. decreased omega- 3 fats, increased monounsaturated fats and decreased unsaturation index with increasing body size) were not restricted to any specific phospholipid molecule or to any specific phospholipid class but were observed in all phospholipid classes. With increase in body mass of mammals both monounsaturates and use of less unsaturated <b>polyunsaturates</b> increases {{at the expense of the}} long-chain highly unsaturated omega- 3 and omega- 6 <b>polyunsaturates,</b> producing decreases in membrane unsaturation.

Of these, 52 % provided information on dietary habits by a food frequency questionnaire. Associations were assessed using partial correlation (Spearman’s rho). In the total population, the concentrations of most circulating B-vitamins were positive-ly associated with serum n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids, but negatively with serum n- 6 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids. However, the associations between B-vitamins and polyunsat-urated fatty acids tended to be weaker in smokers. This could not be solely explained by differences in dietary intake. Furthermore, plasma cotinine, a marker of recent nicotine ex-posure, showed a negative relationship with serum n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids, but a positive relationship with serum n- 6 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids. In conclusion, circulatin...|$|R
40|$|Background and {{objectives}} Several {{studies have reported}} beneficial cardiovascular effects of marine n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids. To date, no large studies have investigated {{the potential benefits of}} marine n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids in recipients of renal transplants. Design, setting, participants, & measurements In this observational cohort study of 1990 Norwegian recipients of renal transplants transplanted between 1999 and 2011, associations between marine n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acid levels and mortality were investigated by stratified analysis and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis adjusting for traditional and transplant-specific mortality risk factors. Marine n- 3 poly-unsaturated fatty acid levels in plasmaphospholipidsweremeasured bygas chromatography in a stable phase 10 weeks after transplantation. Results There were 406 deaths (20. 4 %) during a median follow-up period of 6. 8 years. Mortality rates were lower in patients with high marine n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acid levels ($ 7. 95 weight percentage) compared with low levels (, 7. 95 weightpercentage) for all age categories (pooledmortality rate ratio estimate, 0. 69; 95 %confidence interval, 0. 57 to 0. 85). Whendivided intoquartiles according tomarinen- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fattyacid levels, patients in theupperquartile comparedwith the lowerquartile hada 56 % lower riskofdeath (adjustedhazard ratio, 0. 44; 95 %confidence interval, 0. 26 to 0. 75) usingmultivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. Therewas a lower hazard ratio for death from cardiovascular diseasewith high levels ofmarine n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acid and a lower hazard ratio for death from infectious diseasewith high levels of themarine n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid,whereas therewas no association between total or individual marine n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acid levels and cancer mortality. Conclusions Higher plasma phospholipid marine n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acid levels were independently associated with better patient survival...|$|R
