The Design and Development research methodology introduced by Richey dan Klein (2014) {{was used in this}} study involving three phases. Data from the first phase of needs analysis were collected through a questionnaire distributed to 63 trainee teachers in the Learning Difficulties Special Education Program(PKMP) using purposive sampling. Findings from the closed questions were analyzed by percentage while the open-ended responses were subjected to thematic analysis. The data from the second phase were obtained through the Fuzzy Delphi technique by 20 experts in Health Education, Special Education and also Information and Communications Technology. Analysis relied on the experts’ responses to the questionnaire based on a five-point Likert linguistic scale. The threshold(d) value was calculated to determine the expert consensus on all questionnaire items. The phase two of development involved reviewing the lesson plan; “Healthy Lifestyle” according to the WebQuest procedure using elements like eating habits of learning disabled students, medicine, drugs and nicotine, exercise and recreation, rest,recuperation and leisure as subtopic. The guided <b>projects</b> <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving,</b> task-analysis, and graphic organizer were used as learning techniques. Internet information search, face to face discussion, and simulations as learning activities while role playing and creating powerpoint as an exercise. The phase three or module usability evaluation was done through retrospective on 10 PKMP trainee teachers who had used the WQPKes learning module with two lecturers as facilitators. Semi structured interview responses were analyzed thematically. The findings show that there was a need to develop a WQPKes learning module for trainee teachers in the PKMP program. The majority of trainee teachers agree that Health Education was important to be learned by learning difficulties pupils in primary schools and be taught during teacher training. The majority of trainee teachers also agree that the WQPKes module be developed with cleanliness, food and diet as health education issues and module contents. Findings in the need analysis phase support the development of a WQPKes learning module for trainee teachers. The findings in phase two of design study show that the experts achieved unanimous consensus that the threshold value (d) ≤ 0. 2 exceeded 75 % for the suitability of items in the learning module. The findings of the development phase suggested the need of improvement. The results of module usability evaluation show that the WQPKes learning module is appropriate for trainee teachers of pupils with learning difficulties. They were satisfied with the learning technique, learning activities and exercises prepared in the WQPKes learning module. This learning module strength lies in its ability to enhance knowledge and skills, assist the education of trainee teachers, suitable, easy to follow and interesting, therefore it is potential for the Ministry of Education Malaysia, Teacher Education Institutes in Malaysia (IPGM), lecturers in IPG and student teachers in the PKMP program to use...|$|E

40|$|Project {{management}} is entering into {{every aspect of}} our work with high speed but a relatively low success rate. Based on research into the current project management literature, this thesis concludes that three elements - a competent project manager, right <b>project</b> definition <b>and</b> right <b>project</b> organization are the key factors that determine the project success. This study focuses on the first of these three factors: selection of a competent project manager. The research process uses a web formed questionnaire based on the 102 Project Management Institute competency elements designed to measure Project Manager Knowledge, Performance and Personal competency. This questionnaire was used to gather data concerning real-world experience of critical project management skills from 16 people who have professional project experiences. Based on this data, a new project management tool was developed to highlight effective project manager selection considerations and effective organizational use of <b>project</b> management analysis <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> processes. This new tool attempts to assist the combination of <b>project</b> manager capabilities <b>and</b> organizational capabilities to achieve more effective project success. As a pilot survey, 16 respondents who have project experiences using a project-management approach were invited to complete the study project management questionnaire. The responses concerning the importance of the various elements named in the questionnaire were analyzed. The analysis resulted in a profile representing the critical skills associated with project management from the view of the expert respondents. This thesis proposes this profile as a project manager selection method. It also analyzes organizational project management problems in light of the selection model proposed as a way of helping the <b>project</b> manager, <b>project,</b> <b>and</b> organization move toward more sustainable development.

40|$|This thesis {{involved}} {{an investigation of}} some social aspects of scientific knowledge development. In particular, it focused on the "work patterns" of <b>problem</b> solvers <b>and</b> the "effects" research organisations have on them. The proposed theories were tested in one government research organisation. The "work patterns" of problem solvers were {{defined in terms of}} three stages of work (the Work Programme Development, the Idea Generation of specific <b>projects,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>Problem</b> <b>Solving</b> of these specific projects). It was hypothesised and substantiated, using the log-linear modelling technique, that each stage of work is associated with a distinctive pattern of communication, conceptualised in terms of six dimensions (sources of information, types of information, circumstances and modes of information transfer, and the effects of the information). It was shown that the Work Programme Development occurs in response to information, passively received, from external sources during formal circumstances. Ideas for specific projects are generated on the basis of scientific information acquired from journals. In <b>solving</b> specific projects, <b>problem</b> solvers actively consult internal sources, in informal circumstances. The "effects" of organisations on the work patterns of problem solvers were considered by investigating the effects of (a) three organisational properties (analytic, structural, and global) on internal flows of communication, and (b) those environmental properties on external patterns of communication which could have been investigated in a case study situation. Hypotheses were derived from the resource dependence theory of organisations which was proposed by Pfeffer and Salancik (1978). The investigation {{of the effects of the}} research organisation on the internal flows of communication used locally optimal tests and showed that all three properties of organisations influence the formation of these communications. Internal communications occurred mainly within structural and global constraints, and among people who had similar attributes (analytic properties). Some evidence was found that close physical proximity, which had a strong influence on internal communication, could be overcome by colleague networks, which formed among people with similar analytic properties (autonomy, work related orientations and socially recognised work competence). Informal networks also played an important role in the formation of colleague networks. The investigations of the effects of the research organisation on the patterns of external communication indicated that the vast majority of information which was received from external sources came from other research organisations, and the amount declined with increasing distance from the focal organisation. The very limited communication with the client communities was not geographically constrained. Implications for research administrators were discussed. Consistent with attitudes of the respondents toward the roles of research administrators, the findings of this study suggest that the most important role of research administrators should be in facilitating communication, contacts, and the provision of resources...|$|R
40|$|This <b>project</b> {{describes}} development <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> {{efforts to}} realise a viable portable sensor for arsenic, applicable to drinking water. The {{work is the}} first dedicated effort towards this goal, after the preliminary investigations previously conducted at Cranfield University (Cooper, 2004 and Noh, 2005). Using polymeric gold ink BQ 331 (DuPont Microcircuit Materials, Bristol, UK) as working electrode on screen printed strips, the electrochemical procedure was studied. Due to the wealth of research on electrochemical and non electrochemical methods for arsenic determination, this project attempts to capitalise on the unique advantages of the screen-printed gold surface. In particular, the issues surrounding {{the performance of the}} sensor were evaluated by electrochemical and spectroscopic means (including infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy). A number of custom screen printed electrodes were prepared in house comparing sensor performance on compositional factors. An interference coming from silver interaction with chloride in the reference electrode was identified. As such, the design of the sensor needs to change to include either an immobilising layer, such as Nafion, over the silver, or to omit screen-printed silver altogether. The Nafion was presumed to work by excluding (or at least much reducing) the passage of negatively charged chloride ions to the silver surface preventing formation of soluble silver chloride complexes. The design of the sensor was considered in light of performance and sensitivity. The screen-printed electrodes were cut to facilitate a microband design lending favourable diffusive to capacitive current characteristics. With this design, As(III) detection was demonstrated comfortably at 5 ppb (in a copper tolerant 4 M HCl electrolyte) without electrode need for additional preparation procedures. This is below the World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline and United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) regulation level of 10 ppb in drinking water. The electrode materials are already mass manufacturable at an estimated cost less than £ 0. 5 per electrode. Themicroband design could, in principle, be applied to mercury and other metal ions. The procedure for As(V) either with chemical or electrochemical reduction and determination still needs to be assessed. However, the presented electrode system offers a viable alternative to the colorimetric test kits presently employed around the world for arsenic in drinking water. Also, the Nicholson Method (Nicholson, 1965 a), used for characterising electron transfer kinetics at electrode surfaces, was extended for application to rough surfaces using a fractal parameter introduced by Nyikos and Pajkossy (1988). This work includes mathematical derivation and numerical evaluation and gives a number of predictions for electrochemical behaviour. These predictions could not be tested experimentally, as yet, since the physical conditions must be carefully controlled. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Besides that, the thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> skills of female pupils are significantly higher compared to their male counter parts. This study concludes that de Bono's thinking tools can be used as an alternative to enhance pupils' thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> skills...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} based on a {{descriptive}} study using survey method and focus group interviews. Thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> skills are vital for pupils in their daily lives and facing their future challenges. Therefore, parents and teachers {{play an important role in}} nurturing these skills among pupils. The objective of the study is to explore parents’ and teachers’ views of pupils’ thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> skills according to locations of the school (urban and rural). This study also explores parents’ and teachers’ suggestions to enhance pupils’ thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> skills. The sample consists of 302 parents of the pupils and 104 teachers who are teaching Year 4, Year 5 and Year 6. The quantitative data for the research was collected using questionnaires which were developed by the researchers. Each set of questionnaire consists of 23 items. While the qualitative data was collected through the focus group interview method among parents and teachers to get their suggestions on how to enhance pupils’ thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> skills. The findings show that the urban parents’ views of children’s thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> skills is significantly higher than those from the rural. The results also indicate that there is no significant difference between the urban school teachers’ and the rural school teachers’ views of pupils’ thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> skills. Findings from the focus group interviews show that most parents engage their children in hands on activities at home to enhance their thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> skills. On the other hand, teachers encourage active participation of pupils in co-curricular activities to enhance pupils’ thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> skills...|$|R

Potential ability is always greater than actual ability: the zone of proximal development refers to the range of possibilities that exist between the actual and the potential. Structured interaction (scaffolding) and internalization are the processes that gradually allow potential (for understanding <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving)</b> to become actual (concepts and skills).|$|R

Five instruments, i. e., a problem posing test, a <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> test, a <b>problem</b> posing questionnaire, a <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> questionnaire, <b>and</b> a standard achievement test, were administered to 69 Chinese fifth-grade pupils to assess these five variables and analyze their mutual relationships.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} the relationship of self- efficacy <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> with mental health in adolescents. 914 students (428 boys and 486 girls) completed the General Self-efficacy Scale (GSE; Schwarzer & Jerusalem, 1995), the <b>Problem</b> <b>Solving</b> Inventory (PSI; Heppner & Petersen, 1982), the Coping Scale (CS; Moos & Billings, 1982) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 28; Goldberg, 1972). Results revealed that self- efficacy <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> were the powerful direct predictors of mental health, and efficient coping and inefficient coping were mediated {{on the relationship between}} self- efficacy <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> with mental health. Ineffective coping was mediated on the relationship between <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> <b>and</b> mental health. The findings of this study provided evidence for the mediating mechanisms through which effective coping and ineffective coping mediated the relationships between self- efficacy <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> with mental health in adolescents...|$|R
