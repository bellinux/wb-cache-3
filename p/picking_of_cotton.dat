40|$|Rural {{women in}} Pakistan, under a small holding system offarming, play {{a pivotal role}} in farming. They {{actively}} participatein a range of activities related to crop production and livestockmanagement. Rural women remain busy from dawn to dusk invarious agricultural activities, including pre-harvest, post-harvestand livestock management. Their participation is well dispersedbut less perceived because of insufficient data to show their activeinvolvement in various agricultural activities. Keeping these pointsin mind, {{this study was designed to}} explore the extent of women’sparticipation in various agricultural activities in district Bahawalpur(Southern Punjab, Pakistan). A total of 125 rural women wereselected through multistage random sampling technique and interviewed with a well-designed, pre-tested interview schedule,and the data was analyzed using SPSS. The results of the dataanalysis revealed that rural women’s participation level was at thetop (M = 2. 87 and SD = 0. 42) in <b>picking</b> <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> while their participation level was found low (M = 1. 78 and SD = 0. 88) inbroadcasting of seed/fertilizer among different crop productionand management related activities. While on the other hand theirextent of participation was found at the top (M = 2. 90 and SD = 0. 30) in cleaning of animal’s sheds and found low (M = 2. 02 andSD = 0. 83) in calf rearing among different livestock productionand management which were being performed by rural women. Regarding daily time given by rural women to perform variouscrop production, livestock production and household activitiesmajority of rural women they devote > than 8 hours in a day toperform these activities as reported by 27. 2 %, 32. 8 % and 76. 8 %of the respondents, respectively. It is recommended that nationalcommission should be established to recognize and documentedthe participation of rural women at various national and internationalforums. It is also recommended that women training wing shouldbe established at national level under the supervision of districtadministration to train rural women in different areas of crop andlivestock production so that they can contribute in a better way inthe national economy...|$|E

This paper studied the spontaneous combustion <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> from the aspect of thermal decomposition temperature (TDT) and critical ambient temperature (CAT). From Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis and chromatographic and mass spectrometric analysis, significant thermal decomposition was detected at the temperature of 210 ° C, which indicated that the TDT <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> was around 210 ° C. From TG analysis and small-scale CAT test, activation energy <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> and CAT <b>of</b> small <b>cotton</b> stack were obtained.

Using the appropriate raw material and optimised fibre blends we can influence the mechanical properties and regularity of a yarn as well as significantly {{reduce the number of}} yarn faults. The contribution presents a study of the influence of quality characteristics <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> fibres and constructional parameters of a yarn on the most important properties <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> yarn. The achieved results have been used for determination <b>of</b> optimised <b>cotton</b> fibre blends regarding the quality and price <b>of</b> a <b>cotton</b> yarn. A complex procedure <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> fibre blend determination significantly depends on suitable models for prediction of properties <b>of</b> resulting <b>cotton</b> yarns, in-depth knowledge <b>of</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> fibres and consideration of parameters of a production process.
