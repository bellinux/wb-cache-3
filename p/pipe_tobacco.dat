Odd goes {{to visit his}} mother at the retirement home, which only makes him more unhappy: his mother is senile and spends her days staring emptily out the window, and the visit reminds him of his own impending old age. While Odd is at a restaurant, police come in and arrest the cook. At the shop where he normally buys his <b>pipe</b> <b>tobacco,</b> he learns that the owner has died. He decides to sell his boat, leading to misadventures when the buyer, who works at an airport, asks Odd to meet him there inside the secure zone. Odd goes to the local swimming pool, but his shoes were removed when the facility closed; as he is leaving, he finds a pair of red high-heeled boots and walks away in them.|$|E

25|$|Fire-cured {{tobacco is}} hung in large barns where fires of {{hardwoods}} are kept on continuous or intermittent low smoulder, and takes between three days and ten weeks, depending on {{the process and the}} tobacco.

At one time, the freshly moist Perique was also chewed, but none is now sold for this purpose. It is typically blended with pure Virginia to lend spice, strength, and coolness to the blend.|$|R

25|$|Aromatic {{fire-cured}} is {{cured by}} smoke from open fires. In the United States, it is grown in northern middle Tennessee, central Kentucky, and Virginia. Fire-cured tobacco grown in Kentucky and Tennessee {{is used in}} some chewing tobaccos, moist snuff, some cigarettes, and as a condiment in <b>pipe</b> <b>tobacco</b> blends. Another fire-cured tobacco is Latakia, which is produced from oriental varieties of N. tabacum. The leaves are cured and smoked over smoldering fires of local hardwoods and aromatic shrubs in Cyprus and Syria.|$|E
25|$|The American Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation {{freed the}} entire slave {{workforce}} of the American South. Although some slaves stayed on for pay with their prior slave owners, many left entirely {{to make their}} own lives {{in other parts of the}} country. Tobacco farmers needed to adapt. Not only had they lost their workforce, but also a shift in demand had occurred. In Europe, there was a desire for not only snuff, pipes and cigars, but cigarettes appeared as well. Cigar rolling and even the creation of <b>pipe</b> <b>tobacco</b> at the time was labor-intensive and, without slave labor, innovation needed to occur.|$|E
25|$|Following this {{check to}} {{its attempt to}} create a {{workforce}} that would enable it to exploit its estates directly, Blantyre and East Africa Ltd explored alternative methods of utilising its land. The company did continue to grow tea and some tobacco using the direct labour of tenants under the thangata system or by wage labour. The tobacco produced by direct labour was Flue-cured tobacco, which was cured in brick barns by hot air conducted through metal flues, without smoke coming into contact with the leaf. Its final colour was yellowish brown and it was normally used for cigarettes or as <b>pipe</b> <b>tobacco.</b> This became a significant export for the company from 1907. Although in 1901 it had owned 157,000 acres, the company’s first alternative strategy was to sell or lease some of its land, particularly after the First World War to small planters, which reduced this to 119,500 acres by 1925. Most of the sales and leases were in Blantyre District, the most developed part of the protectorate. Secondly, on its smaller remaining estates in the Shire Highlands and beyond, it ceased to provide supervision but sought to obtain cash rents from African tenants, as it had no need for their labour. Finally, on its largest remaining estate in Zomba District, Blantyre and East Africa Ltd pioneered African tobacco production from 1901. This was of fire-cured tobacco, also known also as dark-fired tobacco, which is cured over open fires, so the leaf absorbs various flavours from the smoke, and substantial acreages were set aside for tobacco growing by African tenants. At first, success was limited, but from 1916, the company increased African production by allocating land, supplying seed, giving instruction and providing suitable storage barns for its tenants. The tobacco they produced is described as of good saleable quality.|$|E

50|$|Often {{considered}} the truffle of <b>pipe</b> <b>tobaccos,</b> perique {{is used as}} a component of various blended <b>pipe</b> <b>tobaccos,</b> as many people consider it too strong to be smoked pure. At one time, the fresh and moist perique was also chewed, but none is now sold for this purpose. Fewer than 16 acres (65,000 m²) of this crop remain in cultivation. Most Louisiana perique is cultivated by farmers Percy and Grant Martin in Grande Pointe, Louisiana. Although at its peak Saint James Parish was producing around 20 tons of perique a year, output is now merely a few barrels. The perique used in <b>pipe</b> <b>tobaccos</b> now is the less expensive Acadian Perique, consisting of Kentucky Green River Burley (from various states) that is processed {{in the same manner as}} perique and blended with St. James grown tobacco. The Acadian perique is made by L.A. Poche. Although the process produces a strong, spicy tobacco, it is a different product from the original straight St. James perique grown on the Martin and Poche family farms.|$|R
500|$|The Tobacco Fund, {{set up in}} September 1914, was {{particularly}} successful. Public donors bought Southern Rhodesian tobacco, cigarettes and <b>pipe</b> <b>tobacco</b> to send to the British forces. This was intended not only to comfort the troops, but also to advertise the prospect of post-war emigration to Rhodesia. The labels on the tobacco tins depicted a map of Africa with the sun shining on Rhodesia, accompanied by the slogan [...] "The World's Great Sunspot". In a similar vein, [...] "Sunspot" [...] was the name given to the Rhodesian cigarettes that British soldiers received. During the war, British and colonial soldiery collectively chewed and smoked 59,955 two-ounce (57g) tins of donated Southern Rhodesian tobacco, 80,584 two-ounce tins of equivalent <b>pipe</b> <b>tobacco,</b> and 4,004,000 Sunspot cigarettes (in packs of 10).

M Worldwide sold approximately 73% of its liquorice products to the tobacco industry in 2005.

Results with reference cigarettes were consistent with published values, providing support for the methodology employed. The emissions of benzene and BaP, expressed as mass emitted per gram of tobacco consumed, were similar for all products evaluated; for benzene, the mean values for cigars, RYO cigarette and <b>pipe</b> <b>tobaccos</b> were 156 +/- 52, 68 +/- 11, and 242 +/- 126 micrograms/g, respectively. Mean values for BaP were 42 +/- 7 and 48 +/- 4 ng/g for cigars and RYO cigarette tobacco, respectively. Lead values were below the limit of reliable quantitation in all cases. The mean benzene concentrations in a puff ranged from 1 to 2 x 10 (5) micrograms/m 3 for cigars, RYO cigarette and <b>pipe</b> <b>tobaccos.</b> For BaP, the puff concentration averaged about 60 micrograms/m 3 for cigars and RYO cigarette tobacco. The results suggest that smoking cigars, pipes or RYO cigarettes leads to potential exposures which exceed the No Significant Risk levels of benzene and BaP set pursuant to California's Proposition 65. These tobacco products are now required to bear a health hazard warning when sold in California. We recommend that this be adopted as national policy...|$|R
