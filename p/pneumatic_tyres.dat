25|$|Gustave Adolphe Clément from 1909 Clément-Bayard (22 September 1855 – 10 March 1928) was a French entrepreneur. An orphan {{who became}} a {{blacksmith}} and a Compagnon du Tour de France, {{he went on to}} race and manufacture bicycles, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres,</b> motorcycles, automobiles, aeroplanes and airships.|$|E
25|$|Some of Baird's early inventions {{were not}} fully successful. In his twenties {{he tried to}} create {{diamonds}} by heating graphite and shorted out Glasgow's electricity supply. Later Baird invented a glass razor, which was rust-resistant, but shattered. Inspired by <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> he attempted to make pneumatic shoes, but his prototype contained semi-inflated balloons, which burst. He also invented a thermal undersock (the Baird undersock), which was moderately successful. Baird suffered from cold feet, and {{after a number of}} trials, he found that an extra layer of cotton inside the sock provided warmth.|$|E
25|$|Having nearly reached 20m in 1923/4, {{the number}} of bus {{passengers}} carried in 1924/5 dropped back to 15.5m after The Mound and Hanover Street route was converted from bus operation to electric trams. By May 1925, the Corporation had 88 buses in regular use. Despite the size, and after a total capital expenditure of nearly £200,000 on buses and garages (of which around three-quarters had already been paid off), they now returned an annual loss of £8,174 on revenues of £109,400, although the loss included the cost of converting half the fleet to <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> (without which, the loss would have been £1,357).|$|E
25|$|J B Dunlop {{resigned}} in 1895, and sold {{most of his}} interest in <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre.</b> In 1896 Harvey Du Cros persuaded his board to sell <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> to financier Ernest Terah Hooley for £3million. Hooley drummed up support by offering financial journalists cheap shares and appointing aristocrats to the board, and quickly sold the business again {{this time as the}} Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> Company for £5million providing a gross profit to Hooley's syndicate including du Cros of £1.7million.|$|R
50|$|Pacific Dunlop has {{its roots}} in the Irish Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> Company, which {{established}} the Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> Company of Australasia in 1893, which included a local finishing factory and office in Melbourne to supply the market with bicycle tyres. In 1899 downturn in cycling's popularity and speculation from the parent company led to the sell-off of Dunlop's Australasian and North American operations, and the Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> Company of Australasia was floated with 80,000 shares, costing £1 per share. The company was listed on Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide stock exchanges.|$|R

25|$|During 1924 {{nearly half}} the fleet were {{converted}} to use <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> (Dunlop & Michelin) instead of the earlier solid rubber or later Supercushion designs; by 1925 the Corporation had already determined based on both direct (price, life) and indirect (vibration damage, fuel consumption) cost comparisons, {{as well as the}} increased passenger comfort, to use them on the entire fleet. The issue of vibration was particularly serious in Edinburgh to the prevalence of granite paved streets. Conversion presented difficulty on the rear twin tyres on the AEC Model 507 double-deckers due to the maximum legal width (7' 6), but this was overcome with in-house modifications.|$|E
25|$|His {{first win}} was in 1893, in Namur-Dinant-Givet in Belgium. He had sold his first bike {{and bought a}} lighter one — still 16kg but with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> — for 850 old French francs (approx €3,000 at 2008 values). The race was over 102km. He was leading by Dinant when he punctured. Spotting a soigneur waiting with a spare bike for a rival, Garin rested his own {{against the wall of}} a bridge, grabbed the soigneur's spare bike and rode off. At the finish, winning with ten minutes over the field, he gave back the bike and {{recovered}} his own the next day where he had left it.|$|E
25|$|First {{production}} run of Birmingham and Midland Motor Omnibus Company (Midland Red) buses takes {{place during the}} 1920s—one of the first British buses to have <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres.</b> BMMO later develop petrol and diesel engines during the 1930s, with experimental rear-engined buses being built. By the 1940s experiments with, and production of under-floor engined single-deck buses take place. Experiments and developments of independent front suspension, air suspension, rubber suspension, glass fibre construction and disc brakes take place during the 1950s. 1959 sees {{the introduction of a}} turbocharged coach capable of almost 100mph, for non-stop motorway services. High speed (motorway) buses are developed with passenger toilets. During the 1960s BMMO becomes the first British bus company to make wide-scale use of computers in compiling bus schedules and staff rosters.|$|E

2500|$|From {{the late}} 1890s, Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> began to acquire its own rubber mills, {{and began to}} process rubber, whereas {{previously}} it had assembled tyres using components from other manufacturers. In 1901 Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> used its majority holding to rename Rubber Tyre Manufacturing – Dunlop Rubber. [...] Arthur Du Cros replaced E J Byrne.|$|R
50|$|The company's origins {{go back to}} 1893, when Ireland's Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> Company {{opened a}} branch office and factory in Melbourne. The branch was sold in 1899 and became a {{separate}} company, Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> Company of Australasia Ltd, independent of the original Dunlop company. After several name changes, the Australian company became Pacific Dunlop.|$|R
25|$|The Leyland Titan TD1 was {{unveiled}} at the Commercial Motor show at London's Olympia exhibition hall in November 1927, {{it was then}} unique amongst double deckers in having a light enough frame to run two-axled on <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> (two at the front and four at the back) yet carry 52 passengers in a bus of 25ft overall length, with such refinements as a six-cylinder overhead-camshaft petrol engine and an unprecedentedly-low frame. The Tiger TS1 was its single–deck counterpart. The wheelbase was slightly longer at 17ft 6in allowing bodywork up to 27ft 6in long, with up to 35 seats. The first Tiger TS1 (chassis 60001A), bodied by Leyland was loaned in March 1927 to H.M.S. Catherwood Ltd of Belfast, it was purchased by them and, sold to other firms, it worked in Ireland until 1940.|$|E
25|$|In 1888, John Boyd Dunlop, a Scottish {{veterinary}} surgeon living in Ireland discovered the pneumatic tyre principle. Willie Hume created publicity for J B Dunlop's discovery by winning {{seven out of}} eight races with his <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres.</b> To own the rights and exploit the discovery, the Pneumatic Tyre and Booth's Cycle Agency Co. Ltd was incorporated in 1889 and floated by Harvey du Cros who was, amongst other things, president of the Irish Cyclists' Association. The invitation to du Cros to participate was made by William Bowden, a Dublin cycle agent. J B Dunlop who could see no prosperous future in his discovery, had informally made over his rights to Bowden. Initially J B Dunlop held a 20 {{percent stake in the}} venture. The company and manufactory was first founded in Stephens Street in Dublin.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{introduction}} of mass-produced <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> by the Dunlop Tyre Company, the use of spoon brakes began to decline, as they tended to quickly wear through the thin casing of the new tyres. [...] This problem led to demands for alternative braking systems. On November 23, 1897, Abram W. Duck of Duck's Cyclery in Oakland, California was granted a patent for his Duck Roller Brake (U.S. Patent 594,234). The duck brake used a rod operated by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin rubber rollers against the front tyre, braking the front wheel.|$|E
2500|$|Peugeot was {{an early}} pioneer in motor racing, with Albert Lemaître winning the world's first motor race, the Paris–Rouen, in a 3hp Peugeot. [...] Five Peugeots {{qualified}} for the main event, and all finished. Lemaître finished 3 min 30 sec behind the Comte de Dion whose steam-powered car was ineligible for the official competition. Three Peugeots were entered in the Paris–Bordeaux–Paris, where they were beaten by Panhard's car (despite an average speed of [...] and taking the 31,500 franc prize. This also marked the debut of Michelin <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> in racing, also on a Peugeot; they proved insufficiently durable. Nevertheless, the vehicles were still very much horseless carriages in appearance and were steered by a tiller.|$|E
2500|$|From the 1920s the {{carriage}} was upgraded; first to Mk 1R (solid rubber tyres) then to Mks 1P or 1PA (new wheels, axles, brakes and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres)</b> for vehicle towing. [...] The Mk 1P was a British conversion which involved {{cutting off the}} ends of the axle and fitting a new axle beneath {{the carriage}} which utilized 9.00 X 16 tyres. The Mk 1PA was the American Martin-Parry (Buquor) conversion in which 'drop down' stub axles were fitted, secured by means of sleeves fitted over {{the ends of the}} original axles. These had larger 7.50 X 24 tyres. [...] The No. 26 artillery trailer was similarly converted. Unlike most other guns and howitzers in British service, calibrating Probert sights were not fitted to the 4.5-inch howitzer.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the period}} of 1920-5, the {{experience}} of running buses at high frequency (every 3 mins) on busy city routes to temporarily replace cable trams exposed the early designs' weaknesses - the vibration issues (particularly bad due to Edinburgh's paved streets), the low capacity and narrow doors in comparison to trams, and the fact that, despite their speed advantage between stops, longer load/unload times often meant they were slower overall. In some cases, the buses were so unpopular they were removed and replaced with electric trams. On the other hand, they were showing their usefulness in other areas. Because of this, by 1925 the department's manager was {{of the opinion that}} trams should still be used for the heaviest and busiest loadings, but never for new routes with a frequency less than 6 per hour, while buses would still remain employed on routes either complementing or connecting existing tram lines, or on routes that were unsuitable or uneconomic for trams. He nonetheless advocated for the bus as a necessary part of new housing developments such as Lochend, where revenue growth over time was evident, and considered the vibration issue solved since the introduction of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres.</b> He concluded that as both modes are so inter-dependent, they [...] "should be considered as a single transport organization for the city." ...|$|E

It was the change of a nightmare, and that all should fit, fifty yards ahead of us a babbling brook barred our way. On the far side a velvet green ride, sprinkled with rabbits and fern, gently sloped upwards and away, but behind us was no hope. Forty horse-power would never have rolled wet <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> up that verdurous cliff we had descended.|$|E

60|$|The {{weather was}} fine, {{and though they}} were on their way southward before nine o'clock, there was already a great {{multitude}} of holiday people abroad upon the roads. There were quantities of young men and women on bicycles and motor-bicycles, and a majority of gyroscopic motor-cars running bicycle-fashion on two wheels, mingled with old-fashioned four-wheeled traffic. Bank Holiday times always bring out old stored-away vehicles and odd people; one saw tricars and electric broughams and dilapidated old racing motors with huge <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres.</b> Once our holiday-makers saw a horse and cart, and once a youth riding a black horse amidst the badinage of the passersby. And there were several navigable gas air-ships, not to mention balloons, in the air. It was all immensely interesting and refreshing after the dark anxieties of the shop. Edna wore a brown straw hat with poppies, that suited her admirably, and sat in the trailer like a queen, and the eight-year-old motor-bicycle ran like a thing of yesterday.|$|E
