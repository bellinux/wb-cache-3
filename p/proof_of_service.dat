[...] Her work is still used {{by some as a}} benchmark, although skepticism has been voiced. Lindley's 2003 Alamo Traces: New Evidence and New Conclusions is the result of his 15-year study of the battle, and upended much of what was previously accepted as fact. He devoted a chapter to deconstructing Williams' research as [...] "misrepresentation, alteration, and fabrication of data", criticizing her sole reliance on the military land grants without checking through the muster lists to identify the combatants. In lieu of service pay, the cash-poor Republic of Texas adopted the system of military land grants. Issuance was dependent upon the military muster lists and either the veterans or their heirs filing a claim, a process that required an upfront fee to complete. Lacking a completed claim, <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> would appear only on a muster list.|$|E

40|$|Non-repudiation allows an {{exchange}} of data between two principals {{in such a manner}} that the principals cannot subsequently deny their participation in the exchange. Current non-repudiation schemes, while providing a mandatory <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> origin <b>service,</b> generally provide only discretionary <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> receipt since it is difficult to enforce the return <b>of</b> the <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> receipt by the recipient. In this paper a new scheme for achieving mandatory mutual non-repudiation is proposed, encompassing both mandatory <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> origin and mandatory <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> receipt. The fundamental feature of the scheme is that the <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> origin and receipt are not exchanged until both principals have submitted their digitally signed evidence to a trusted third party intermediary. This ensures that if the non-repudiation protocol is not completed, neither principal can gain from the exchange. An added advantage is that the process of dispute arbitration is considerably simplified since a small number of rules are required to decide whether an alleged data exchange took place...|$|R
