2500|$|Milling {{had been}} {{performed}} at Arborfield {{since at least}} 1500, as foundations dating to that time were discovered in 1953. The mill was originally a grist mill, used for grinding corn or flour, but George Dawson converted it to a paper mill. A Mr. Hodgson was the <b>paper</b> <b>maker</b> in 1787, and in 1794 the business was auctioned as a going concern. In 1826, the large water wheel powered a [...] paper making machine. Three years later {{there was a fire}} at the mill, and another in 1861. Output from the mill included fine brown paper. Mrs Hargreaves, the owner of Arborfield Hall, is thought to have demolished part of the mill some time after 1861, but it was offered for sale again in 1919, and at the time included a [...] water wheel and a [...] turbine. Pumps and a dynamo supplied water and electricity to the hall, and powered the machinery on the farm. In the 1840s or 1850s, an engine house was built near the mill, which housed a Barrett, Exall & Andrews steam engine, which was manufactured in Reading. Two steam engines later powered the paper mill. The mill was owned by Guthrie Allsebrook from the 1920s, who hoped to supply water to the local authority, because he also owned the water rights. The ground floor of the building still exists, and was in use by Thames Water in 2004.|$|E
