40|$|This study {{presents}} the results from a survey of landowner interest in a propositional <b>payment</b> <b>modality</b> for Costa Rica's Pagos por Servicios Ambientales (PSA) program {{that is based on}} a sliding-scale payment scheme. This payment scheme would transition from higher monetary payments per hectare per year for the first units of land invested, to lower payments per hectare per year for additional units of land invested; however, as payments per hectare decrease, monetary payments would be supplemented with non-financial rewards. This program structure is designed to 1) offer higher per-hectare financial incentives to smaller-scale landowners, who would otherwise face steep trade-off costs by transitioning to conservation-based land-use, and 2) offer greater non-financial incentives to larger-scale landowners, who face less sharp trade-off costs, and who might be more interested in prestige- and status-based non-financial incentives than the currently meager PSA payments. I found support for the proposed program modality across all classes of landowners. Interest in PSA participation by small- and medium-scale landowners showed sensitivity to proposed payments, with landowners indicating a strong desire to participate in conservation land-use as soon as the proposed financial incentives were sufficient to cover their opportunity costs. Large-scale landowners showed little sensitivity to payment size, and in general—with mode= 10 and median= 7 responses on a 10 point Likert-scale—indicated strong willingness to participate in the PSA program under the proposed structure, even if financial incentives per hectare were decreased significantly for large investments of land, but prestige- and status-based awards were introduced. These results are discussed {{in the context of an}} emerging literature on signaling theory, conspicuous conservation, and the interaction of financial incentives and social norms...|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{concern that the}} indigent health care burden in the southwestern United States may be caused partly by Mexican {{residents}} who cross the border to use U. S. health services. This article describes the first attempt to measure the extent of this use by border residents. It also compares factors associated with their use of health care services in both the United States and Mexico. Data were obtained from a household survey conducted in Tijuana, Mexico, near the California border, using a random, stratified analytic sample of 660 households that included a total of 2, 954 persons. The dependent variables [...] extent and volume of contacts with health professionals [...] were examined according to sociodemographic characteristics, insurance coverage, <b>payment</b> <b>modality,</b> type of visit, and health care setting. The results indicate that 40. 3 percent of the Tijuana population used health services exclusively in Mexico during a 6 -month period, compared with only 2. 5 percent who used services in the United States. Of the Mexican users of U. S. services, the largest proportion appeared to be older people, lawful permanent residents or citizens of the United States who are living in Mexico, and persons from high- or middle-income sectors. In addition to {{the low level of}} use of U. S. health services, the findings show that more than 84 percent of the visits were to providers in the private sector and, for 59 percent of the visits, a fee for services was implied. Overall, this border population {{does not seem to be}} a drain on the U. S. public health system. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach based on mobile agents {{for the implementation}} of a platform for an Internet service provider. The aim of the approach is to implement a service provider that can provide services that are reliable, low-cost and flexible. One of the main features is to make it possible to serve clients who do not have particular hardware characteristics and do not need special software to access the service they require, but are only equipped with an engine for network access. 1 Introduction A problem that has emerged {{in the last few years}} is the need to access network services available, in Internet, in such a way as to exploit the resources provided by servers. There are two requirements in this scenario: one the one hand, it is necessary to have something which is able to provide these services, i. e. a service provider, and on the other it is necessary to define the features a client has to possess in order to request certain services and the <b>modality</b> (<b>payment,</b> authen [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Market {{gardening}} {{has been}} increasing fast in Senegal. But farmers face high marketing risks: daily price fluctuations exceed an average 20 % for some products, seasonality is strong, anticipation based on prices leads to cyclic movements. Farmers and market operators have found various forms of coordination to manage uncertainty. “Coxers” are specifically dedicated to information gathering, either in rural or wholesale urban markets or to transport negotiation. Paid per unit handled, they limit their own risk, whereas they reduce uncertainty for their partners. In other cases, interlinked transactions permit to provide inputs to producers despite the deficient credit market; meanwhile, it secures merchants access to product. As {{it is the case}} in many other countries, information provided by MIS is of little help to Senegalese market gardeners. The updated and more targeted access to information through MANOBI services allows producers to improve their negotiation capacity. But it does not modify the existing coordination features, given that they are not only determined by needs in information (but also by social links, access to credit, <b>payment</b> <b>modalities,</b> transport facilities…).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the role participatory design {{can play in}} developing and implementing an information and communication technology for development project in a rural area. It shows how the process of co-designing an artifact can reflect and shape social development. A case {{study was conducted in}} the Mankosi Community in the Eastern Cape with the aim of designing and implementing a billing system for an existing community-owned telephony system, by accommodating the community’s requirements. Relevant criteria had to be considered for this telephony system based on voice over Internet Protocol with the possibility of ‘break-out’ calls to external networks. Different <b>payment</b> <b>modalities</b> were explored that would allow for a transparent method of both collecting money and applying the collected funds to achieve the project’s sustainability. A participative methodology with future users and operators of the network—using scenarios and prototypes to illustrate the implementation—informed the design of the billing system. Data was collected by means of unstructured interviews and focus group discussions. Qualitative data was analyzed using a qualitative content analysis tool. The community indicated that a billing system, based on both vouchers and prepaid service, would satisfy their needs.

40|$|Two of {{the seven}} major {{development}} challenges of the Royal Government of Bhutan identified for the Donors Development Forum, held in Thimpu in November 2000, were private sector development and employment generation. Given {{the fact that the}} public sector is unlikely to expand further in the forseeable future, these issues become {{two sides of the same}} coin. Future employment generation in Bhutan can only come from the further growth of the private sector. The prinicpal objectives of this report and associated survey work is to assist the Government in developing an improved information base on the private sector and to thereby assist it in formulating its strategy for private sector support over the period of the Ninth Five-Year Development Plan. The main recommendations put forth for private sector development include: Establishment of a transparent system of tax relief and possibly a system of industry levies to support radically increased worker and management training. Development of a transparent, time-bound, policy for recruiting non-national workers. Encouragement of the development of innovative financial instruments and <b>payment</b> <b>modalities.</b> Support of technology transfer mechanisms and provide incentives through tax breaks.

40|$|Hawala networks, or Informal Funds Transfer Systems (IFTS), are age-old {{means of}} {{conducting}} cross-border financial transactions. They thrive in regions {{where there is}} inadequate or nonexistent financial infrastructure due to poverty, daunting geography, or endemic conflict. Such regions are home to poor and underserved communities hungry for and {{in desperate need of}} financial services. IFTS provide access to these relatively ignored markets through the use of specific transactional mechanisms, <b>payment</b> <b>modalities,</b> and clearing and settlement options. With these innovative and flexible techniques, IFTS have successfully tapped into the exponentially growing global remittance market. Hawala networks are also used by NGOs and humanitarian aid organizations operating in post-conflict regions, and by diaspora communities looking to provide vital services for family members in their country of origin. IFTS, however, can also be illegitimately used for smuggling, capital flight, or terrorist activities. Formal financial institutions can learn how to better access the remittance market and serve remote or poor communities by learning from the key operational characteristics that make IFTS so successful: speed and efficiency, accessibility and adaptability, affordability, anonymity, cultural sensitivity, and relational contracts. Understanding these operational characteristics can allow for innovative, Hawala-inspired inclusion techniques to be incorporated into the formal infrastructure. Mobile banking, adaptive financial procedures and services, broad integration, and a shift in the banking culture would not only allow for formal financial institutions {{to gain access to the}} lucrative remittance market, but would also improve access to financial services for the poor and underserved...|$|E
40|$|Background: National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) {{is one of}} {{the health}} {{financing}} options adopted by Nigeria for improved healthcare access especially to the low income earners. One of the key operators of the scheme is the health care providers, thus their uptake of the scheme is fundamental to the survival of the scheme. The study reviewed the uptake of the NHIS by private health care providers in a Local Government Area in Lagos State. Objective: To assess the uptake of the NHIS by private healthcare practitioners. Materials and Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study recruited 180 private healthcare providers selected by multistage sampling technique with a response rate of 88. 9 %. Result: Awareness, knowledge and uptake of NHIS were 156 (97. 5 %), 110 (66. 8 %) and 97 (60. 6 %), respectively. Half of the respondents 82 (51. 3 %) were dissatisfied with the operations of the scheme. Major reasons were failure of entitlement payment by Health Maintenance Organisations 13 (81. 3 %) and their incurring losses in participating in the scheme 8 (50 %). There was a significant association between awareness, level of education, knowledge of NHIS and registration into scheme by the respondents P-value < 0. 05. Conclusions: Awareness and knowledge of NHIS were commendable among the private health care providers. Six out of 10 had registered with the NHIS but half of the respondents 82 (51. 3 %) were dissatisfied with the scheme and 83 (57. 2 %) regretted participating in the scheme.

40|$|Payments for {{environmental}} services (PES) represent a new, more direct way to promote conservation. They explicitly {{recognize the need}} to address difficult trade-offs by bridging the interests of landowners and external actors through compensations. Theoretical assessments praise the advantages of PES over indirect approaches, but in the tropics PES application has remained incipient. Here I aim to demystify PES and clarify its scope for application {{as a tool for}} tropical conservation. I focus on the supply side of PES (i. e., how to convert PES funding into effective conservation on the ground), which until now has been widely neglected. I reviewed the PES literature for developing countries and combined these findings with observations from my own field studies in Latin America and Asia. A PES scheme, simply stated, is a voluntary, conditional agreement between at least one “seller” and one “buyer” over a well-defined environmental service—or a land use presumed to produce that service. Major obstacles to effective PES include demand-side limitations and a lack of supply-side know-how regarding implementation. The design of PES programs can be improved by explicitly outlining baselines, calculating conservation opportunity costs, customizing <b>payment</b> <b>modalities,</b> and targeting agents with credible land claims and threats to conservation. Expansion of PES can occur if schemes can demonstrate clear additionality (i. e., incremental conservation effects vis-`a-vis predefined baselines), if PES recipients’ livelihood dynamics are better understood, and if efficiency goals are balanced with considerations of fairness. PES are arguably best suited to scenarios of moderate conservation opportunity costs on marginal lands and in settings with emerging, not-yet realized threats. Actors who represent credible threats to the environment will more likely receive PES than those already living in harmony with nature. A PES scheme can thus benefit both buyers and sellers while improving the resource base, but it is unlikely to fully replace other conservation instrumen...|$|E
40|$|A gap in {{knowledge}} exists regarding the economic burden on households of subsidized anti-retroviral treatment (ART) programs in Nigeria. This is because patients also incur non-ART drug costs, which may constrain the delivery and utilisation of subsidized services. An exit survey of adults (18 +years) attending health facilities for HIV/AIDS treatment {{was conducted in}} three states in Nigeria (Adamawa, Akwa Ibom and Anambra). In the states, ART was fully subsidized but there were different <b>payment</b> <b>modalities</b> for other costs of treatment. Data was collected and analysed for direct and indirect costs of treatment of HIV/AIDS and co-morbidities' during out-and in-patient visits. The levels of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) were computed and disaggregated by state, socio-economic status (SES) and urban-rural location of the respondents. Catastrophic Health Expenditure (CHE) in this study measures the number of respondents whose monthly ART-related household expenditure (for in-patient and out-patient visits) {{as a proportion of}} monthly non-food expenditure was greater than 40 % and 10 % respectively. The average out-patient and in-patient direct costs were $ 5. 49 and $ 122. 10 respectively. Transportation cost was the highest non-medical cost and it was higher than most medical costs. The presence of co-morbidities contributed to household costs. All the costs were catastrophic to households at 10 % and 40 % thresholds in the three states, to varying degrees. The poorest SES quintile had the highest incidence of CHE for out-patient costs (p< 0. 0001). Rural dwellers incurred more CHE for all categories of costs compared to urban dwellers, but the costs were statistically significant for only outpatient costs. ART subsidization is not enough to eliminate economic burden of treatment on HIV patients. Service decentralization to reduce travel costs, and subsidy on other components of HIV treatment services should be introduced to eliminate the persisting inequitable and high cost burden of ART services. Full inclusion of ART services within the benefit package of the National Health Insurance Scheme should be considered...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to reveal patterns in the treatment of health conditions in a Quechua-speaking community in the Bolivian Andes based on plant use data from traditional healers and patient data from a primary health care (PHC) service, and to demonstrate similarities and differences between the type of illnesses treated with traditional and biomedical health care, respectively. Methods A secondary analysis of plant use data from semi-structured interviews with eight healers was conducted and diagnostic data was collected from 324 patients in the community PHC service. Health conditions were ranked according to: (A) the percentage of patients in the PHC service diagnosed with these conditions; and (B) the citation frequency of plant use reports to treat these conditions by healers. Healers were also queried about the <b>payment</b> <b>modalities</b> they offer to their patients. Results Plant use reports from healers yielded 1166 responses about 181 medicinal plant species, which are used to treat 67 different health conditions, ranging from general symptoms (e. g. fever and body pain), to more specific ailments, such as arthritis, biliary colic and pneumonia. The results show that treatment offered by traditional medicine overlaps with biomedical health care in the case of respiratory infections, wounds and bruises, fever and biliary colic/cholecystitis. Furthermore, traditional health care appears to be complementary to biomedical health care for chronic illnesses, especially arthritis, and for folk illnesses that are particularly relevant within the local cultural context. Payment from patients to healers included flexible, outcome contingent and non-monetary options. Conclusion Traditional medicine in the study area is adaptive because it corresponds well with local patterns of morbidity, health care needs in relation to chronic illnesses, cultural perceptions of health conditions and socio-economic aspects of health care. The quantitative analysis of plant use reports and patient data represents a novel approach to compare the contribution of traditional and biomedical health care to treatment of particular health conditions. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Global carbon {{stocks in}} forest biomass are {{decreasing}} by 1. 1 Gt of carbon annually, owing to continued deforestation and forest degradation. Deforestation emissions are partly offset by forest expansion {{and increases in}} growing stock primarily in the extra-tropical north. Innovative financial mechanisms {{would be required to}} help reducing deforestation. Using a spatially explicit integrated biophysical and socio-economic land use model we estimated the impact of carbon price incentive schemes and <b>payment</b> <b>modalities</b> on deforestation. One payment modality is adding costs for carbon emission, the other is to pay incentives for keeping the forest carbon stock intact. Results Baseline scenario calculations show that close to 200 mil ha or around 5 % of todays forest area will be lost between 2006 and 2025, resulting in a release of additional 17. 5 GtC. Today's forest cover will shrink by around 500 million hectares, which is 1 / 8 of the current forest cover, within the next 100 years. The accumulated carbon release during the next 100 years amounts to 45 GtC, which is 15 % of the total carbon stored in forests today. Incentives of 6 US$/tC for vulnerable standing biomass payed every 5 year will bring deforestation down by 50 %. This will cause costs of 34 billion US$/year. On the other hand a carbon tax of 12 $/tC harvested forest biomass will also cut deforestation by half. The tax income will, if enforced, decrease from 6 billion US$ in 2005 to 4. 3 billion US$ in 2025 and 0. 7 billion US$ in 2100 due to decreasing deforestation speed. Conclusion Avoiding deforestation requires financial mechanisms that make retention of forests economically competitive with the currently often preferred option to seek profits from other land uses. Incentive payments need to be at a very high level to be effective against deforestation. Taxes on the other hand will extract budgetary revenues from the regions which are already poor. A combination of incentives and taxes {{could turn out to be}} a viable solution for this problem. Increasing the value of forest land and thereby make it less easily prone to deforestation would act as a strong incentive to increase productivity of agricultural and fuelwood production, which could be supported by revenues generated by the deforestation tax. </p...|$|E
