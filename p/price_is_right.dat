5|$|In the episode's opening scene, the Griffins are {{traveling}} to Quagmire's {{cabin in the}} woods; Peter notes {{that it will be}} a better vacation than when they appeared in the American game show The <b>Price</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> pricing game Cliff Hangers. Cleveland is also shown playing the pricing game Plinko. As Stewie and Brian decide to go berry-picking in the forest, actor Don Most slowly rises from the fog nearby as a chorus sings about his role as Ralph on the ABC sitcom Happy Days to the melody of the title song from Brigadoon.|$|E

A truncated version of the [...] "losing horns" [...] from <b>Price</b> <b>was</b> also used for bonus round losses.|$|R

The syndicated version was directed by Matthew Cohen from 2002 to 2010, by Rob George from 2010 to 2013, and by Brian McAloon in the 2013–14 season. Former <b>Price</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> director Rich DiPirro became Millionaires director in 2014.|$|E
5|$|In his eighties, Nielsen {{performed}} serious roles {{on screen}} and stage (such as his one-man theatre show Darrow, {{in which he}} played Clarence Darrow), {{as well as providing}} voice-overs and appearances for commercials; cartoons like Zeroman where he had the leading role/voice; children's shows, such as Pumper Pups, which he narrated, in addition to comedic film roles. The sibling relationship with his elder brother, the Honourable Erik Nielsen, a former Deputy Prime Minister of Canada, served as the premise of an HBO mockumentary entitled The Canadian Conspiracy in which Leslie Nielsen appeared, along with other prominent Canadian-born media personalities. He was a celebrity contestant on CBS's Gameshow Marathon, where he played The <b>Price</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Right,</b> Let's Make a Deal, Beat the Clock, and Press Your Luck for charity.|$|E
50|$|Holding church {{services}} in the school house or in the town hall, the founding families of St. Paul’s discussed the next step of building a church. A convenient Walnut Creek location was found on School Street (now Locust Street) and the <b>price</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> On December 19, 1887 a gold coin {{in the amount of}} $175 was exchanged for a deed for the land on School Street.|$|R
50|$|After a {{shortage}} of goals {{in the second half}} of the previous season had cost United the league title, Alex Ferguson began the hunt to sign a new striker. A name which had been strongly linked with United for months was Alan Shearer, the 21-year-old Southampton and England striker. United's hopes of signing Shearer were given a boost on 7 July when Southampton manager Ian Branfoot announced that Shearer could leave the Hampshire club if the <b>price</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Cohen {{wanted to}} hire Vincent Price {{for the lead}} and also {{considered}} Orson Welles, but Anglo-Amalgamated pushed for a British actor in the lead, {{as it would be}} cheaper, so they decided to use Michael Gough. Arthur Crabtree was hired {{on the basis of his}} work on Fiend Without a Face."The <b>price</b> <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> and the old guy needed a job and I hired him," [...] recalled Cohen. [...] "And he was exactly what I wanted and needed as a good craftsman." ...|$|R
5|$|After his {{retirement}} {{as a player}} in 1994, Simms first joined ESPN {{then went on to}} join NBC's lead broadcast crew, teaming with Dick Enberg and Paul Maguire on that network's coverage of Super Bowl XXX and Super Bowl XXXII. Simms also announced Weightlifting at the 1996 Summer Olympics and served as a sideline reporter on the NBA on NBC for NBC Sports.

5|$|The daily {{syndicated}} {{version of}} Wheel premiered on September 19, 1983, {{preceded by a}} series of episodes taped on location at the Ohio State Fair and aired on WBNS-TV in Columbus, Ohio. From its debut, the syndicated version offered a larger prize budget than its network counterpart. The show came from humble beginnings: King World chairmen Roger, Michael, and Robert King could initially find only 50 stations that were willing to carry the show, and since they could not find affiliates for the syndicated Wheel in New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago, Philadelphia was the largest market in which the show could succeed in its early days. Only nine stations carried the show from its beginning, but by midseason it was airing on all 50 of the stations that were initially willing to carry it, and by the beginning of 1984 the show was available to 99 percent of television households. Soon,Wheel succeeded Family Feud as the highest-rated syndicated show, and {{at the beginning of the}} 1984–85 season, Griffin followed up on the show's success by launching a syndicated revival of Jeopardy!, hosted by Alex Trebek. The syndicated success of Wheel and Jeopardy! siphoned ratings from the period's three longest-running and most popular game shows, Tic-Tac-Dough, The Joker's Wild, and Family Feud, to the point that all three series came to an end by the fall of 1986. At this point, Wheel had the highest ratings of any syndicated television series in history, and at the peak of the show's popularity, over 40 million people were watching five nights per week. The series, along with companion series Jeopardy!, remained the most-watched syndicated program in the United States until dethroned by Judge Judy in 2011. The program has become America's longest-running syndicated game show and its second-longest in either network or syndication, second to the version of The <b>Price</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> which began airing in 1972. The syndicated Wheel has become part of the consciousness of over 90 million Americans, and awarded a total of over $200 million in cash and prizes to contestants.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the filmmakers}} needed an 18th-century French setting, {{shooting}} {{the film in}} its original setting of Paris was unlikely due to the extensive modernization {{of the city in}} the 19th century. Croatia was initially considered as an alternative because of its earthy scenery and pristine old-world towns, but even though the <b>price</b> <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> the distance between locations proved to be disadvantageous. In the end, the filmmakers opted to shoot most of the film in Catalonia, Spain which, although more expensive than Croatia, offered locations which were closer to each other.|$|R
50|$|In 1980, {{he saw a}} {{building}} {{on the corner of}} Gansevoort and 9th Avenue in the Meat Packing District with a rental sign on the door. The <b>price</b> <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> and the dilapidated old duplex was soon the center of a unique, revolving universe of friends and scene-makers. It also became a hotel, way-station, and halfway house for people either visiting or moving to the city. Artists, musicians, and performers dropped by at all hours to hang out, and it was this feeling of an ongoing 24-hour salon that gave Sullivan the idea to begin videotaping his life. His best friend and constant companion was a black Labrador Retriever named Blackout.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the initial}} and ongoing controversy, The Spin Doctor's Diary was shortlisted for Political Book of the Year in the Channel 4 News Awards of 2006. In 2008 {{it was named}} by GQ Magazine {{as one of the}} top 50 {{political}} books of all time. Matthew Parris of The Times called the book [...] "sensational". It was criticised by Rafael Behr in The Observer for not taking us [...] "close enough to the personalities or even the underlying motives of Campbell or Blair" [...] On the other hand, Sir Stephen Wall, former advisor to Prime Minister Tony Blair said that [...] "Lance <b>Price</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> to publish, and should not be damnned". Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London reacted in his diary within the New Statesman: [...] "Lance <b>Price</b> <b>is</b> a turd".|$|R

25|$|On March 26, 2008, Ludia (in {{connection}} with Ubisoft) launched The <b>Price</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> video game for PC. A version for the Wii and Nintendo DS platforms {{was released in}} September 2008, while a version for the iOS was released in November 2008. The show's announcer, Fields, was {{the host of the}} computer version. The virtual set in the game resembles the set used in seasons 31 to 34. Ludia announced that all three platforms will receive {{a new version of the}} video game that was previewed at the Target Bullseye Lounge during the Electronic Entertainment Expo trade show on June 2–4, 2009. The <b>Price</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> 2010 Edition was released on September 22, 2009. In the fall of 2010, Ludia developed a multi-player version for Facebook. A third Ludia adaptation, The <b>Price</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> Decades, featuring set designs, pricing games and prizes taken from the 1970s through 2000s; was initially released for the Wii in October 2011, with an Xbox 360 and iOS release following in November and December. The <b>Price</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> 2010 Edition and The <b>Price</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> Decades have also been released as downloads within the PlayStation Store for the PlayStation 3 in May 2010 and April 2012, respectively. Irwin Toys released an electronic tabletop version in 2008 featuring Contestant's Row, the Big Wheel, a physical Plinko board with chips, Showcases and seven pricing games. Jakks Pacific released a Plug It in and Play version of The <b>Price</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> in 2009, featuring Carey and Fields.|$|E

2500|$|Behind the scenes, Carpenter {{worked with}} cinematographer Douglas Knapp (a fellow USC student), art {{director}} Tommy Lee Wallace, sound mixer Bill Varney and property master Craig Stearns. [...] "I hardly {{knew what the}} job required," [...] said Wallace, [...] "but he believed in me, and, of course my <b>price</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> It <b>was</b> typical of John during those lean days. He made {{the very best of}} whatever talent and facilities he had around him." [...] Carpenter drew storyboards for key sequences, including the [...] "ice cream truck" [...] sequence, the death of the white warlord, Napoleon Wilson struggling to get the keys of the guard after the siege starts, and the failed escape by prisoner Wells.|$|R
5000|$|Matson {{supported}} himself {{playing football}} during {{an era when}} the game was supposedly an amateur sport. He was a [...] "gun for hire", and moved clubs frequently, playing outside the main leagues if the <b>price</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> Thus, he played for South Bunbury in 1904-05, Boulder City in 1906-08, Sturt (in Adelaide) in 1909-10, North Fremantle in 1911, Subiaco in 1912-17 and East Perth in 1918-23. A fast, vigorous and versatile utility with an ability to take the big mark (despite being only 179 cm), he played at half-back and half-forward and took turns in the ruck. He played for both South Australia (1909-10) and Western Australia (1908, 1911, 1914) and captained the Sandgropers at the 1914 interstate carnival.|$|R
50|$|The Betamax and VHS home {{videocassette}} formats {{were introduced}} in 1975 and 1976 respectively, taking several years and reducing in cost before they started to become a widespread household fixture. Film studios and video distributors assumed that consumers {{would not want to}} buy prerecorded videocassettes, just rent them. They also felt that virtually all of the sales would be to video rental stores, setting prices appropriate to this as a business model. Eventually it was realized that many people did want to build their own video libraries as well as rent if the <b>price</b> <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> and found that a title which had sold a few hundred copies at $99 might sell tens or even hundreds of thousands of copies at $19.99 or $9.99.|$|R
25|$|Road to Price is a six episode reality {{documentary}} show {{aired on}} the now-defunct CBS Innertube from September 20 to 27 in 2006.

25|$|Meanwhile, Match Game {{kept its}} high {{standing}} in the ratings despite a short-lived move ahead one half-hour from August to December 1975. In November 1977, however, CBS made a fatal mistake regarding the show's time slot. Noting a ratings boon resulted when The <b>Price</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> and Match Game were paired in afternoons, a major hole in the schedule had developed in the morning slot that The <b>Price</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> had left behind. In an attempt to resolve the crisis, CBS moved Match Game to 11:00 a.m., immediately following The <b>Price</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> at 10:00 a.m. However, because much of Match Games audience was composed of students who were in school {{at that time of}} day, ratings began to sag and eventually free fall; many of these students did not return. As a result, Family Feud quickly supplanted Match Game as television's highest-rated game show.|$|E

5000|$|The {{series was}} {{released}} piecemeal {{over a period}} of about two years, during which period Microsoft was able to dominate the market with Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. While the Claris packages were arguably much more [...] "approachable" [...] than the Microsoft applications, the Claris software applications lacked some features of the now-mature Microsoft suite, leaving them lacking in [...] "checkbox features." [...] Their value was further eroded by aggressive bundling deals from Microsoft that could allow Word, Excel, and PowerPoint to be purchased for a cost not much higher than MacWrite alone—a bundle that Claris did not match. Claris did offer ClarisWorks, an all-in-one package; and, while the <b>price</b> <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> ClarisWorks <b>was</b> very limited and could not compete in the business market. Microsoft also released a Works package.|$|R
5000|$|San Diego {{seemed an}} ideal spot, and the <b>price</b> <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> but {{a series of}} {{windmills}} would have to be set up to pump water. The Company rejected the idea. Of San Bernardino he said, too hot. Of Anaheim he didn't care for the superabundance of fleas nor the number of [...] "musketers" [...] (gun toters). Of San Fernando he said, the price at $2 per acre was acceptable, but the area was only good for growing grain. There was too little access to water for citrus growing. The Indianans had their hearts set on orchards. Rancho Santa Anita was the collective lands of today's Arcadia, Monrovia, Duarte, El Monte, and Baldwin Park. The property had absolutely everything required for citrus growing, but at $20 per acre the place was too expensive.|$|R

The {{problems}} that he helps her range from her metaphysical issues to defending her from Olaf. Edward acts a little like a boyfriend to her to keep Olaf at bay, since no one else that Anita dates or loves is dominant enough. Yet Anita says she could never feed off Edward in any way because it would be like doing a family member. Edward admits to have been contacted as Death to take out the Mother of Darkness and he turned down the contract.

5000|$|One {{night in}} 1932, Jones {{and his wife}} were guests at an {{informal}} dinner party aboard Charles W. Bidwill's luxurious power-cruising yacht. Bidwell, a lawyer and {{the vice president of the}} Chicago Bears, spoke with Jones that night. Inevitably, the conversation turned to pro football, with Jones complaining of the poor state of his team. Half jokingly, Charles wife, Violet, asked Jones, [...] "Why don't you sell the Cardinals to Charley?" [...] Jones replied that he would sell anything he owned if the <b>price</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> Bidwell soon turned to Jones and the two began to discuss an offer. Bidwell would go on to buy the Cardinals from Jones for $50,000. Bidwill handed Jones a down payment of $2,000 to seal the deal and the two men shook hands. The sale was not announced until 1933 to allow Bidwill time to dispose of his stock in the Chicago Bears.|$|R
