40|$|Using {{a simple}} network model with two <b>parallel</b> <b>links</b> <b>connecting</b> a diverge and a merge, this paper studies under what {{conditions}} traffic oscillations may be initiated and propagated in a traffic stream, specially at freeway bottlenecks. Drivers are assumed to minimize either the experienced or instantaneous travel times, and in doing so, they settle at a Wardrop (day-to-day) equilibrium or a Boston (within-day) traffic equilibrium, respectively. We prove that the path travel time function in our model is not monotone, and show that this property leads to multiple Wardrop equilibria, of which only one is both stable and efficient. The paper shows that periodic traffic oscillations do not arise from Wardrop equilibria. Trivial oscillations exist at Boston equilibria, which are caused by drivers' overreaction to traffic conditions. However, periodic oscillations are likely to emerge when (1) transitions between stable and unstable equilibria take place, and more importantly, (2) drivers {{make decisions based on}} out-of-date information of traffic conditions. The latter finding is useful in guiding control practice at freeway bottlenecks and work zones to prevent traffic oscillations.

40|$|Differences in {{the thermal}} and {{electrical}} switching time constants between <b>parallel</b> <b>connected</b> devices cause imbalances {{in the power}} and temperature distribution thereby reducing module robustness. In this paper, the impact of electro-thermal variations (gate and thermal resistance) between <b>parallel</b> <b>connected</b> devices on module robustness is investigated for 900 V-CoolMOS and 1. 2 kV-SiC MOSFETs under clamped inductive switching (CIS) and unclamped inductive switching (UIS). Under CIS, {{the difference in the}} steady-state junction temperature (ΔTJ) and switching energy (ΔESW) between the <b>parallel</b> <b>connected</b> devices for a given difference in the gate and thermal resistance (ΔRG & ΔRTH) is used as the metric for determining robustness to electrothermal variations i. e. how well the devices maintain uniform temperature in-spite of switching with different rates and thermal resistances. Under UIS conditions, the change in the maximum avalanche current/energy prior to device failure {{as a function of the}} ΔTJ and ΔRG between the <b>parallel</b> <b>connected</b> devices is used as the metric. Under both CIS and UIS, SiC devices show better performance with minimal negative response to electrothermal variations between the <b>parallel</b> <b>connected</b> devices. Finite element models have also been performed showing the dynamics of BJT latch-up during UIS for the different technologies...|$|R
