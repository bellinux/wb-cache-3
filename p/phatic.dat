The paper aims to study theoretical and pragmatic aspects of emotions and {{to propose a}} semantic representation of emotions for oral dialogues, based on an analysis of real-life conversations, telephone messages and recorded TV programmes, focusing on a relationship between prosody and lexeme {{for the purposes of}} a speech to speech machine translation. The semantic representation is made, by using the Universal Networking Language (UNL) formalism, in a way where lexeme, <b>phatics,</b> gestures, prosody and voice tone are taken into account at the same time. ...|$|R

The observed limited set of users' grammatical and ungrammatical forms demonstrates the sufficiency of a very restricted grammar of English for a natural language interface to an advisory system. The users' language shares many features of spoken face-to-face language or of language generated under real- time production constraints (i. e., very simple forms of utterances). Yet, users also appeared to believe that the natural language interface could not handle fragmentary or informal language and users planned or edited their language to be more like formal written language (i. e., very infrequent fragments and <b>phatics).</b> Finally, users also appeared to believe in poor shared context between users and computerized advisers and referred to objects and events using complex nominals instead of faster-to-type pronouns...|$|R

40|$|In {{patients}} with {{carcinoma of the}} breast for whom radiation therapy is indicated, radionuclide lymphoscintigraphy {{has been used as}} a noninvasive tracer technique for the location of the in ternal mammary lymph nodes (I). The rationale for this diagnostic test is to disclose the medial drainage pathway of the breast lym <b>phatics</b> to the internal mammary nodes,whichare said to lie in the intercostal spaces, deep to the sternum and 3 cm lateral to it (2, 3). Recent information accumulated from our lymphoscinti scans suggests that node position can be quite variable, and many are located at a considerable distance from this anticipated location (4). Preciseknowledgeof node location, particularly the depth, is essential if tangential-beam irradiation is to ensureadequate treatment. This study describes an imaging technique that allows for the location oflymph-node position; the information is directly applicable to the planning of radiation therapy portals. MATERIALS AND METHODS Injection technique. The site of injection is important, to provide adequate lymphatic uptake ofactivity and subsequent visualization of the nodes. The technique as described by Ege indicates the need for a subcostal injection approximately 3 cm inferior to the xiphoid process and 1 - 2 cm medial to the midclavicular line (1). With the patient in the supine position, 0. 5 - 1. 0 mCi of technetium- 99 m antimony trisulfide (Tc- 99 m Sb 2 S 3) * in a volume of approximately 0. 25 ml is deposited anterior to the posterior rectus sheath.

40|$|Interaction with {{computers}} in natural language requires {{a language that}} is flexible and suited to the task. This study of natural dialogue was undertaken to reveal those characteristics which can make computer English more natural. Experiments were made in three modes of communication: face-to-face, terminal-to-terminal and human-to-computer, involving over 80 subjects, over 80, 000 words and over 50 hours. They showed some striking similarities, especially in sentence length and proportion of words in sentences. The three modes also share the use of fragments, typical of dialogue. Detailed statistical analysis and comparisons are given. The nature and relative frequency of fragments, which have been classified into twelve categories, is shown in all modes. Special characteristics of the face-to-face mode are due largely to these fragments (which include <b>phatics</b> employed to keep the channel of communication open). Special characteristics of the computational mode include other fragments, namely definitions, which are absent from other modes. Inclusion of fragments in computational grammar is considered {{a major factor in}} improving computer naturalness. The majority of experiments involved a real life task of loading Navy cargo ships. The peculiarities of face-to-face mode were similar in this task to results of earlier experiments involving another task. It was found that in task oriented situations the syntax of interactions is influenced in all modes by this context in the direction of simplification, resulting in short sentences (about 7 words long). Users seek to maximize efficiency In solving the problem. When given a chance, in the computational mode, to utilize special devices facilitating the solution of the problem, they all resort to them. Analyses of the special characteristics of the computational mode, including the analysis of the subjects" errors, provide guidance for the improvement of the habitability of such systems. The availability of the REL System, a high performance natural language system, made the experiments possible and meaningful. The indicated improvements in habitability are now being embodied in the POL (Problem Oriented Language) System, a successor to REL...|$|R

5000|$|In {{linguistics}} and {{the philosophy}} of mind, a locutionary act is the performance of an utterance, and hence of a speech act. The term equally refers to the surface meaning of an utterance because, according to J. L. Austin's posthumous [...] "How To Do Things With Words", a speech act should be analysed as a locutionary act (i.e. the actual utterance and its ostensible meaning, comprising phonetic, <b>phatic</b> and rhetic acts corresponding to the verbal, syntactic and semantic aspects of any meaningful utterance), {{as well as an}} illocutionary act (the semantic 'illocutionary force' of the utterance, thus its real, intended meaning), and in certain cases a further perlocutionary act (i.e. its actual effect, whether intended or not).|$|E
50|$|With his formulaic {{approach}} to the ars dictaminis, Lawrence introduced a pragmatic form in his Practica that “took the chartistic view to its ultimate point” (Murphy 1974). Furthermore, the Practica marks a shift from content- to form-based writing and emphasizes a “phatic rhetoric of personal and official relations” (Perelman 1991). Unlike the classical rhetorical style concerned with persuasion, Lawrence’s works concern writing for social purposes, as is clear from his extensive treatment of the salutation in his treatises on letter writing (Jensen 1973). Medieval rhetoric scholar, James J. Murphy, stresses the <b>phatic</b> approach characterized by Lawrence’s writing, noting “It is the addressee’s level which determines {{the nature of the}} letter, not the subject matter or the level of the writer, or the intentions of the writer” (1974).|$|E
50|$|Turn-taking is {{developed}} and socialized from {{very early on}} - the first instances being the interactions between parent and child - but it can still {{be thought of as}} a learned skill, rather than an innate attribute. Conversational turn-taking is greatly affected by culture. For instance, in Japanese culture social structure and norms of interaction are reflected in the negotiation of turns in Japanese discourse, specifically with the use of backchannel, or reactive tokens (aizuchi). Backchannel refers to listener responses, mostly <b>phatic</b> expressions, that are made to support both the speaker's flow of speech and their right to maintain the floor in conversation. Aizuchi is simply the Japanese term for backchannel, but some linguists make a distinction since the importance of aizuchi in Japanese conversation can be considered higher than in English conversation.|$|E
50|$|For example: John Smith {{turns to}} Sue Snub and says ‘Is Jeff’s shirt red?’, to which Sue replies ‘Yes’. John has {{produced}} a series of bodily movements which result {{in the production of}} a certain sound. Austin called such a performance a phonetic act, and called the act a phone. John’s utterance also conforms to the lexical and grammatical conventions of English—that is, John {{has produced a}}n English sentence. Austin called this a <b>phatic</b> act, and labels such utterances phemes. John also referred to Jeff’s shirt, and to the colour red. To use a pheme with a more or less definite sense and reference is to utter a rheme, and to perform a rhetic act. Note that rhemes are a sub-class of phemes, which in turn are a sub-class of phones. One cannot perform a rheme without also performing a pheme and a phone. The performance of these three acts is the performance of a locution—it is the act of saying something.|$|E

5000|$|Over {{the past}} half century, there have been efforts by psychoanalysts and {{cognitive}} psychologists {{to bridge the gap}} between their two respective disciplines. Rizzuto (2002) has discussed the nature of the verbal exchange between analyst and patient in the context of Roman Jakobson's (1976, 1990) typology of the six functions of [...] "the speech event": (1) referential, involving contextual information; (2) poetic, referring to the construction of the form of the message; (3) emotive, or the speaker's emotional influence vis-a-vis the receiver; (4) conative, or the speaker's orientation toward the receiver; (5) <b>phatic,</b> or the attempt to establish and maintain contact between speaker and receiver (e.g., [...] "Can you hear me?"); and (6) metalingual, or the application of language to itself (e.g.,"What do you mean with that word?"). Rizzuto (2002) suggests that by paying an equal amount of attention to each of the six functions of the speech act, the analyst can obtain a more comprehensive picture of the patient's affective life. Conversely, by focusing on one function at a time, the analyst can ascertain the patient's different ways of mitigating anxiety or coping with stress.|$|E
5000|$|The idea of defamiliarisation {{was further}} {{explored}} by the Prague School Theory {{with one of}} the main scholars, Jan Mukarovsky, and by later developments in the theory of Roman Jakobson. Jan Mukarovsky postulates the idea that linguistic deviation, such as foregrounding, is the hallmark of poetic texts (Pilkington 2000, p. 16). He claimed that the use of linguistic devices such as tone, metaphor, ambiguity, patterning and parallelism distinguish ordinary language from poetic language. In the 1960s, Jacobson introduced the poetic function of literary texts and further developed the idea that the use of certain linguistic choices draw attention to the language of texts. He placed poetic language at the centre of his inquiry and emphasized that phonetically and syntactically repeated linguistic elements distinguish literary from non-literary texts. He tried to define literariness by distinguishing between six functions of language: the emotive, referential, <b>phatic,</b> metalingual, conative and poetic function (Zwaan 1993, p. 7) [...] To Jacobson, the poetic function is the most important function as it mainly focuses on the message itself (Zwaan 1993, p. 7). The different linguistic devices in a piece of literary text initiate the reader to have {{a closer look at the}} happenings in the text which without linguistic distortion, might have been left unnoticed. Thus, Roman Jakobson emphasised that what makes a literary text is merely associated with the language as self-sufficient entity while reference to social life, history, or anything outside the language is irrelevant.|$|E
