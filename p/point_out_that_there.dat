5|$|Opponents of this {{proposed}} location <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{is very little}} archaeological or historical evidence supporting {{the establishment of a}} Hellenistic polis within Jerusalem, let alone sited on the western hill which appears to have been only sparsely populated during the Hellenistic period. Excavations in today's Jewish Quarter display evidence of habitation from the First Temple Period, as well as renewed Hasmonean and Herodian settlement, but scant evidence of Hellenistic occupation. Research into the dispersal of stamped Rhodian amphorae handles has revealed that over 95% of these handles found in Jerusalem were excavated from the City of David, indicating the city had not yet expanded to the western hill during Seleucid rule. Furthermore, the western hill is separated from the Temple Mount and the City of David by the steep Tyropoeon Valley—a distinct tactical disadvantage for any force that may have been required to intervene in events within the temple precincts or heavily populated eastern sectors of Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} {{opinions on the}} significance of these principles. Some note that the osteopathic medical philosophy is akin to the tenets of holistic medicine, suggestive of a kind of social movement within the field of medicine, one that promotes a more patient-centered, holistic approach to medicine, and emphasizes the role of the primary care physician within the health care system. Others <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is nothing in the principles that would distinguish D.O. from M.D. training in any fundamental way. One study, published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association found a majority of M.D. medical school administrators and faculty saw nothing objectionable in the core principles listed above, and some endorse them generally as broad medical principles.|$|E

25|$|Most Mussorgsky biographers {{claim that}} the {{directorate}} of the Imperial Theatres also rejected the revised version of Boris Godunov, even providing a date: 6 May 1872 (Calvocoressi), or 29 October 1872 (Lloyd-Jones). Recent researchers <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is insufficient evidence to support this claim, emphasizing that in his revision Mussorgsky had rectified the only objection the directorate {{is known to have}} made.|$|E

25|$|Opponents {{of the dam}} <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{are three}} {{different}} kinds of floods on the Yangtze River: floods which originate in the upper reaches, floods which originate in the lower reaches, and floods along {{the entire length of}} the river. They argue that the Three Gorges dam will actually make flooding in the upper reaches worse and have little or no impact on floods which originate in the lower reaches. Twelve hundred years of low water marks on the river were recorded in the inscriptions and the carvings of carp at Baiheliang, now submerged.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 {{computer}} {{analysis of the}} Book of Mormon text supports this theory, although the study does not include Joseph Smith in the author sample {{on the ground that}} few pure examples of Smith's writings are extant. Several other significant problems are apparent in the methodology of this {{computer analysis}}, specifically the use of closed set methodology instead of open set methodology. For example, the original methodology, when replicated, also assigns Rigdon as the probable author of The Federalist Papers, which were written five years before his birth. Critics of the Spalding–Rigdon theory <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no record of any meeting between Rigdon and Smith until December 1830, nearly a year after the Book of Mormon was published.|$|E

25|$|Norman and Bennett {{note that}} some studies that {{compared}} alcoholics with non-alcoholics suggest alcoholism {{is linked to}} increased externality for health locus of control; however, other studies have linked alcoholism with increased internality. Similar ambiguity {{has been found in}} studies of alcohol consumption in the general, non-alcoholic population. They are more optimistic in reviewing the literature on the relationship between internal health locus of control and smoking cessation, although they also <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are grounds for supposing that powerful-others and internal-health loci of control may be linked with this behavior. It is thought that, rather than being caused by one or the other, that alcoholism {{is directly related to the}} strength of the locus, regardless of type, internal or external.|$|E
25|$|Bor-Komorowski′s {{description}} is disputed by Russian historian Oleg Vishlyov, who claims, {{based on the}} original Soviet documents, that the conference was not between NKVD and Gestapo, but between Soviet and German commissions dealing with refugees in both occupied territories and that the topic of discussion was allegedly the 'refugee exchange'. According to that author the conference {{had nothing to do}} with repressions against Poles or with the Katyn massacre. Meanwhile, some historians (including Wojciech Materski) <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is evidence of clandestine murder operations conducted by both Soviet and German forces in 1939–1940 across occupied Poland, however, there is no evidence of direct connection between the NKVD prisoner massacres and the German AB-Aktion in Poland leading to massacre of several thousand prominent Poles in the same time-frame.|$|E
25|$|German historians Hans Henning Hahn and Eva Hahn have {{published}} a {{detailed study of}} the flight and expulsions. They maintain that figures related to flight and expulsion have been manipulated by the German government due to political pressure. The Hahn's believe the official German figure of 2 million deaths is an historical myth, lacking foundation. They place the ultimate blame for the mass flight and expulsion on the wartime policy of the Nazis in Eastern Europe. The Hahn's maintain that the 473,013 confirmed deaths is a correct accounting of the losses. Most of these losses occurred during the Nazi organized flight and evacuation during the war, and the forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union; they <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are 80,522 confirmed deaths in the postwar internment camps.|$|E

25|$|Margaret Rossiter, an American {{historian}} of science, offered three concepts {{to explain the}} reasons behind the data in statistics and how these reasons disadvantaged women in the science industry. The first concept is hierarchical segregation. This is a well-known phenomenon in society, that the higher the level and rank of power and prestige, the smaller the population of females participating. The hierarchical differences <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are fewer women participating at higher levels of both academia and industry. Based on data collected in 1982, women earn 54 percent of all bachelor's degrees in the United States, with 50 percent of these in science. The source also indicated that this number increased almost every year. There are fewer women at the graduate level; they earn 40 percent of all doctorates, with 31 percent of these in science and engineering.|$|E
25|$|Psychological {{formalism}} {{is defined}} as the science of mind and corresponds to the behavior of animal objects. Human psychology {{is considered to be a}} unique subset of psychological formalism that deals with human behavior at the level of the individual. Because human behavior is immersed in the larger socio-cultural context (level four in the ToK System), human psychology is considered a hybrid discipline that merges the pure science of psychology with the social sciences. It is important to <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are other disciplines the ToK System would classify as “hybrids.” Molecular genetics, for example, is a hybrid between chemistry and biology and neuroscience is a hybrid between biology and psychology. As with Henriques' proposed conception of human psychology, both of these disciplines adopt an object level perspective (molecular and cellular, respectively) on phenomena that simultaneously exist as part of meta-level system processes (life and mind, respectively).|$|E

2500|$|Just as {{different}} types of evolutionary explanations have evolved, so there are {{different types of}} theistic evolution. Creationists Henry M. Morris and John D.
