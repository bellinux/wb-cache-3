5|$|Chānakya (c. 350–283 BC), {{also known}} as Kautilya, was adviser and prime {{minister}} to the first Maurya Emperor Chandragupta (c. 340–293 BC). Kautilya suggested employing means such as seduction, secret use of weapons, and poison for <b>political</b> <b>gain.</b> He also urged detailed precautions against assassination—tasters for food and elaborate ways to detect poison. In addition, {{the death penalty for}} violations of royal decrees was frequently administered through the use of poison.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Versailles {{stipulated that}} Germany must {{relinquish}} {{several of its}} territories and demilitarise the Rhineland. The treaty imposed economic sanctions and levied heavy reparations on the country. Many Germans saw the treaty as an unjust humiliation—they especially objected to Article 231, which they interpreted as declaring Germany responsible for the war. The Versailles Treaty and the economic, social, and political conditions in Germany after the war were later exploited by Hitler for <b>political</b> <b>gain.</b>|$|E
5|$|These {{terms were}} {{initially}} applied to British people perceived as prejudiced against the Boers, {{in the context}} of political conflict between the British and the Boers in southern Africa which culminated in the British defeat of the Boers in the Second Boer War. Accusations of Boerehaat have subsequently been made by Afrikaner nationalists to exploit historical British prejudice against the Boers for <b>political</b> <b>gain.</b> They have applied the term Boerehater to anyone who criticised them or opposed their interests in the Cape Colony, including English-speaking white South Africans, dissident Afrikaners and black South Africans.|$|E

5|$|Charuseela {{returns to}} Devarakota and assumes that Harsha {{is trying to}} impress her family with the {{intention}} of marrying her. Initially livid, Charuseela is impressed when Harsha succeeds in persuading her uncle's family not to migrate to the city to live with their employed son and instead makes their son agree to visit them every possible weekend. Later, Harsha and Charuseela learn that Ratnam is going to take over all the agricultural land around the village for <b>political</b> <b>gain</b> since the value of the land will appreciate following the official declaration of a new coastal industrial corridor. Harsha confronts them and warns them not to interfere in his work of developing the village.|$|E
5|$|Cosades inducts {{the player}} into the Blades on the Emperor's orders, {{and sets the}} player on various quests to uncover the mysterious disappearances and revelations that the {{citizens}} of Vvardenfell have experienced, particularly the Sixth House and the Ashlander prophecies of the Nerevarine. It is later revealed that the induction under Cosades, and the player's release from prison, {{was due to the}} Emperor's suspicion that the player might be the Nerevarine – a reincarnation of the legendary Dunmer hero Indoril Nerevar – or at least someone would make a convincing imposter to use for <b>political</b> <b>gain.</b> The PC is tasked with uncovering the prophecies regarding the Nerevarine, and to fulfil them in order to finally defeat Dagoth Ur and his Sixth House cult.|$|E
5|$|Combs {{created a}} merit system for state {{government}} workers, ensuring that officials {{could not be}} hired or fired for political reasons. This provision attracted more well-qualified people to public service careers. Such careers were made even more attractive when, in 1962, the state courts declared that the salaries of state employees, the amounts of which were specified in the state constitution, could be adjusted for inflation. Combs demanded that state employees stick strictly to the rules governing their offices. In one instance, Combs ordered a state audit of Carter County superintendent Heman McGuire, who was known to use his office for <b>political</b> <b>gain.</b> While Combs {{did not have the}} authority to remove McGuire directly, the audit showed McGuire's misappropriation of funds and abuse of power. The state school board investigated these findings and removed the county school board members from office; the replacement board members then ousted McGuire.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the deaths}} of two further partners, Backhouse in 1879 and Turnbull in 1880, Storey bought their shares to become the Echos chief proprietor. A year later, in 1881, he met Scottish-born millionaire Andrew Carnegie, and formed a {{syndicate}} with him to set up new newspapers and buy up others. Among those purchased were the Wolverhampton Express and Star, the Northern Daily Mail in Hartlepool and the Portsmouth Evening News. An attempt to buy the Shields Gazette, the country's oldest daily newspaper, failed. The syndicate finally broke up in 1885, with Storey retaining control of the Echo, Hampshire Telegraph, Portsmouth News and the Northern Daily Mail. These papers {{formed the basis of}} a new company, Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers Ltd, formed in the 1930s. The 19th century ended with the rivalry between the Echo and the Sunderland Daily Post intensifying. The Silksworth Colliery strike of 1891 pitted the two papers against each other, with the Post attacking Storey for having exploited the strike for <b>political</b> <b>gain.</b> Storey successfully sued for libel.|$|E
5|$|In 1095 Pope Urban II {{called for}} the First Crusade in a sermon at the Council of Clermont. He {{encouraged}} military support for the Byzantine Empire and its Emperor, AlexiosI, who needed reinforcements for his conflict with westward migrating Turks colonising Anatolia. One of Urban's aims was to guarantee pilgrims access to the Eastern Mediterranean holy sites that were under Muslim control but scholars disagree as to whether this was the primary motive for Urban or those who heeded his call. Urban's strategy may have been to unite the Eastern and Western branches of Christendom, which had been divided since the East–West Schism of 1054 and to establish himself {{as head of the}} unified Church. The initial success of the Crusade established the first four Crusader states in the Eastern Mediterranean: the County of Edessa, the Principality of Antioch, the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the County of Tripoli. The enthusiastic response to Urban's preaching from all classes in Western Europe established a precedent for other Crusades. Volunteers became Crusaders by taking a public vow and receiving plenary indulgences from the Church. Some were hoping for a mass ascension into heaven at Jerusalem or God's forgiveness for all their sins. Others participated to satisfy feudal obligations, obtain glory and honour or to seek economic and <b>political</b> <b>gain.</b>|$|E

50|$|Some analysts {{suggest that}} Nasser took actions aimed at reaping <b>political</b> <b>gains,</b> which he knew carried {{a high risk}} of precipitating {{military}} hostilities. On this view, Nasser's willingness to take such risks was based on his fundamental underestimation of Israel's capacity for independent and effective military action.|$|R
25|$|Anti-Armenian sentiment, {{also known}} as Anti-Armenianism and Armenophobia, is a diverse {{spectrum}} of negative feelings, dislikes, fears, aversion, derision and/or prejudice towards Armenians, Armenia, and Armenian culture. Modern anti-Armenianism is usually expressed by opposition to the actions or existence of Armenia, aggressive denial of the Armenian Genocide or belief in an Armenian conspiracy to fabricate history and manipulate public and political opinion for <b>political</b> <b>gain.</b>|$|E
25|$|It becomes pseudoscientific when science {{cannot be}} {{separated}} from ideology, scientists misrepresent scientific findings to promote or draw attention for publicity, when politicians, journalists and a nation's intellectual elite distort the facts of science for short-term <b>political</b> <b>gain,</b> or when powerful individuals of the public conflate causation and cofactors by clever wordplay. These ideas reduce the authority, value, integrity and independence of science in society.|$|E
25|$|A major coastal cyclone struck East Pakistan on 12 November 1970, leaving {{hundreds}} of thousands dead and millions displaced. Bengalis were outraged and unrest began because of what was considered the weak and ineffective response {{of the central government}} to the disaster. Public opinion and political parties in East Pakistan blamed the governing authorities as intentionally negligent. The West Pakistani politicians attacked the Awami League for allegedly using the crisis for <b>political</b> <b>gain.</b> The dissatisfaction led to divisions within the civil services, police and Pakistani Armed Forces.|$|E

30|$|This study uses several {{facts about}} the DI program {{administrative}} procedure to deter-mine the role political gaming by governors may play in expanding disability rolls: the inherent principal-agent tension from the federal-funding, state-administration structure; the <b>political</b> <b>gains</b> for governors from lower unemployment rates; and, the lack of oversight in program administration.|$|R
25|$|Philip IV {{had three}} sons, Louis, Philip and Charles. As was {{customary}} for the period, {{all three were}} married with an eye for <b>political</b> <b>gain.</b> Initially Philip had intended for Louis to marry Joan, the eldest daughter of Otto IV, Count of Burgundy, {{but in the end}} chose Margaret, the daughter of the Robert II, Duke of Burgundy, in 1305, and arranged for his middle son Philip to marry Joan in 1307. His youngest son Charles married Blanche, another of Otto's daughters, in 1308.|$|E
25|$|According to {{a protest}} organisation, formed {{in part by}} Joan Laporta, L'Elephant Blau, the former {{president}} Núñez promoted the emergence of skinheads among the Boixos and gave them permission to roam freely around the stadium, using them for his own <b>political</b> <b>gain.</b> When Núñez resigned in 2000, his vice-president Gaspart took over as president. Gaspart publicly expressed his sympathies for Boixos Nois, claiming that he would join the group {{as soon as he}} resigned as chairman. The comment caused the Boixos Nois members to occasionally be referred to as 'the chairman's boys'.|$|E
25|$|Tamil cinema {{has played}} {{a vital role in}} Dravidian {{politics}} in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Films have been influential in Indian politics {{since the days of the}} British Raj, when movies were used for anti-British propaganda. Nevertheless, the leaders of the Indian National Congress viewed movie media with contempt. It was the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a Dravidian party, that made extensive use of this media for propaganda purposes. Adversaries of Dravidian parties despised the use of films and screen popularity for <b>political</b> <b>gain,</b> and Congress leaders like K.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to try to}} explain if risk {{assessments}} are important at political leaders´ foreign policy decisions. Different qualitative methods are used, and texts and documents are analysed. Prospect theory focuses on decision making under uncertainty, and its applicability is tested on Prime Ministers Göran Persson´s and Fredrik Reinfeldt´s foreign policy decisions on the peace-generating operations in Afghanistan and Libya. Judging from the empirical material risk assessments were important during all phases of Persson´s foreign policy decisions, but only during some phases of Reinfeldt´s foreign policy decisions. A plausible explanation of this difference is the Prime Ministers´ different assessments of <b>political</b> <b>gains</b> and losses. Persson assessed that he could achieve <b>political</b> <b>gains</b> in the international arena by his foreign policy decisions, while Reinfeldt assessed that he could incur political losses in the national arena by his foreign policy decisions. Being in the gains domain Persson´s risk assessments were important during the whole decision process, being in the losses domain Reinfeldt´s risk assessments were only important during some phases of the decision process. The findings of this thesis indicate that the importance of risk assessments at political leaders´ foreign policy decisions depends on their assessments of <b>political</b> <b>gains</b> and losses. The findings also indicate that prospect theory´s applicability can be successfully tested on small states not directly affected by a conflict...|$|R

25|$|Ney, {{as chair}} of the House Administration Committee, {{approved}} a 2002 license for an Israeli telecommunications company to install equipment to improve cell phone reception in the Capitol and adjacent House office buildings, equipment that would generate significant revenue for the firm. The company, then Foxcom Wireless, an Israeli start-up telecommunications firm, (which has since moved headquarters from Jerusalem to Vienna, Va., and been renamed MobileAccess Networks) later paid Abramoff $280,000 for lobbying. It also donated $50,000 to Abramoff's Capital Athletic Foundation, a non-profit organization that Abramoff used to redistribute money for personal and <b>political</b> <b>gain.</b>|$|E
25|$|Great {{instability}} {{was mainly}} {{the result of}} marginalization of ethnic groups, and graft under these leaders. For <b>political</b> <b>gain,</b> many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts, some {{of which had been}} exacerbated, or even created, by colonial rule. In many countries, the military was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order, and it ruled many nations in Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s. During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential assassinations. Border and territorial disputes were also common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.|$|E
25|$|The Spartacus revolt had {{originated}} in a gladiator school privately owned by Lentulus Batiatus, {{and had been}} suppressed only after a protracted series of costly, sometimes disastrous campaigns by regular Roman troops. In the late Republican era, a fear of similar uprisings, the usefulness of gladiator schools in creating private armies, and the exploitation of munera for <b>political</b> <b>gain</b> led to increased restrictions on gladiator school ownership, siting and organisation. By Domitian's time, many had been more or less absorbed by the State, including those at Pergamum, Alexandria, Praeneste and Capua. The city of Rome itself had four; the Ludus Magnus (the largest and most important, housing up to about 2,000 gladiators), Ludus Dacicus, Ludus Gallicus, and the Ludus Matutinus, which trained bestiarii.|$|E
