The <b>Palau</b> <b>Arrangement,</b> through the <b>Palau</b> <b>Arrangement</b> Purse-seine Vessel Days Management Scheme, now limits the amount of effort (in terms of number of fishing days) that can be exercised by purse-seine vessels in PNA waters during any one calendar year. A Longline Vessel Days Management Scheme is currently under trial and is planned to be introduced on 1 January 2013.|$|E

In particular, clarifying that any calendar day in which any fishing activity takes place will be counted as a full fishing day, with limited exemptions for days in which the only activities during that day are bona-fide emergencies, breakdowns, refuelling, repairs, or expeditious transit with fully stowed fishing gear.|$|E

This article discusses the most recent arrangement [...] the <b>Palau</b> <b>Arrangement.</b> It traces its history and identifies its strengths and weaknesses.

40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s, island States of the South Pacific, {{confronted with the}} need to develop {{appropriate}} arrangements to enable them to manage highly migratory fish stocks in the western central Pacific ocean, developed the <b>Palau</b> <b>Arrangement</b> for the Management of the Western Pacific Purse Seine Fishery. This paper traces the development of the <b>Palau</b> <b>Arrangement</b> from a legal and political perspective. The implementation of the Arrangement has led to tension between coastal States and States fishing in the region which will need to be resolved if both sides are to fulfil the duty to cooperate in the management of highly migratory fish stocks under LOSC and the 1995 Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. fisheries conservation management regional cooperation economics...|$|E
40|$|The Vessel Day Scheme (VDS) {{under the}} <b>Palau</b> <b>Arrangement</b> {{is the largest}} and most complexfishery {{management}} arrangement ever to be put in place, {{at least in terms of}} the value of thefishery, the area covered and the multi-national nature of the fishery. Its significance to theconservation of the worldÃÂ¿s last remaining healthy tuna stocks cannot be underestimated. It also represents a paradigm shift in the way in which Pacific Island States have oftenviewed their tuna resources. For a long time, the major beneficiaries from their tuna stockshave been vessels from distant-water fishing nations (DWFNs). The change from capacitylimits to effort controls was not without resistance. DWFNs did not want to see effort controlsreplace capacity limits, which they believed rightfully belonged to them. This article discussesthe VDS, highlights its key features and explores a number of options which may be applied by the Pacific Island States in its implementation. The article also examines some of the issuesthat could potentially have an impact on the implementation of the scheme. The article concludesthat the VDS puts power firmly in the hands of Pacific Island States. The onus howeveris on the Pacific Island States to ensure that they achieve the efficacy desired by the planners ofthe VDS...|$|E
40|$|Tuna {{fisheries}} {{provides an}} important source of income, foreign exchange and employment for many Pacific Island States. It is also seen as a major avenue for industrial development by most Pacific Island States. The Law of the Sea Convention, while recognising the rights of coastal States to manage and develop tuna resources within their EEZs also obligates these States to co-operate with other States in the management and development of the resources. The Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) and its sub-regional group, the PNA (Parties to the Nauru Agreement) provide an interesting case study of regional co-operation on tuna. Through the <b>Palau</b> <b>Arrangement</b> and the FSM Arrangement, the PNA group illustrate attempts to manage and develop their purse seine fisheries. This paper provides a brief background to these arrangements and their implementation. It shows the Group’s motivation to cooperate to develop uniform strategies to help each other and also points out the hurdles the Island States encounter when participating in a highly sophisticated industrial fishery. The paper states that the Arrangements if modified in light of the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Convention have the potential to strengthen these States position to better negotiate with Fishing Nations to achieve their objectives. The case study highlights three important and interrelated components of sustainable regional fisheries development: management objectives to be based on sound scientific principles using a precautionary approach, the need for institutional mechanisms for co-operation within the core group and the wider group, and a more defined rights-based fisheries management framework...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the experience of}} a group of eight Pacific Island coastal States in exercising their sovereign rights for the EEZ {{to take control of the}} tuna fishery and reduce dominance of the distant water fishing fleets. The group is established under the Nauru Agreement Concerning Cooperation in the Management of Fisheries Common Interest, with the membership including the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. Known widely as the Parties to the Nauru Agreement, the group has adopted a cooperative framework and work together to establish a number of instruments to facilitate the co-ordination and harmonisation the management of the common fish stocks within their EEZs. In doing this, the Parties to the Nauru Agreement were asserting and protecting their sovereign rights, creating economic opportunities for their people, and conserving and managing the tuna fish stock. The thesis argues that the Parties to the Nauru Agreement has taken control of their tuna fishery through the introduction of the instruments such as the minimum terms and conditions for access under the First, Second and Third Implement Arrangements of the Nauru Agreement, the <b>Palau</b> <b>Arrangement</b> for the Management of the Western Pacific Purse Seine Fishery to limit fishing effort and the establishment of the Federated States of Micronesia Arrangement for Regional Access which provide preferential treatment for the domestic and/or locally-based vessels. The thesis concludes that in order to maintain and/or strengthen the control the Parties to the Nauru Agreement have attained, the group needs to redefine its cooperative framework to cater for the different interests they have acquired...|$|E
