500|$|As the U.S. vice president, Coolidge and his vivacious wife Grace {{were invited}} to quite a few parties, where the legend of [...] "Silent Cal" [...] was born. It is from this time {{that most of the}} jokes and anecdotes {{involving}} Coolidge originate. Although Coolidge was known to be a skilled and effective public speaker, in private {{he was a man of}} few words and was commonly referred to as [...] "Silent Cal". A possibly apocryphal story has it that a matron, seated next to him at a dinner, said to him, [...] "I made a bet today that I could get more than two words out of you." [...] He replied, [...] "You lose." [...] Dorothy Parker, upon learning that Coolidge had died, reportedly remarked, [...] "How can they tell?" [...] Coolidge often seemed uncomfortable among fashionable Washington society; when asked why he continued to attend so many of their dinner parties, he replied, [...] "Got to eat somewhere." [...] Alice Roosevelt Longworth, a leading Republican wit, underscored Coolidge's silence and his dour personality: [...] "When he wished he were elsewhere, he <b>pursed</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> folded his arms, and said nothing. He looked then precisely as though he had been weaned on a pickle." ...|$|E

60|$|BLUNTSCHLI (<b>pursing</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> and {{rounding}} <b>his</b> eyes). Oh-o-oh! I {{never found}} it. It must be there still.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] {{said the}} photographer, <b>pursing</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> in a pleased smile, [...] "that I caught the {{features}} {{just in a}} moment of animation." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Pursing</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> tightly, {{and looking}} at each of us {{for a few moments}} in silence, he finally crossed his arms on his chest, and turning eagerly to Jack, said with extreme volubility-- ...|$|R

6000|$|Mackay <b>pursed</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> up, and, with {{overdone}} gravity, {{shook his}} head. [...] "I'm fearing we cannot spare ye {{with the new}} mounts to train." ...|$|E
60|$|The negro {{threw back}} his head and began one of his silent laughs, but {{suddenly}} stopped, opened his eyes wide, <b>pursed</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> and moved his broad shoulders uneasily.|$|E
6000|$|... (In alarm, rising, as Knox <b>purses</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> to bid them enter.) Don't {{let anybody}} in. I don't {{want to be}} seen here--with you. Besides, my {{presence}} will not put you in a good light.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{the man for}} the ladies," [...] said Mr. Browne, <b>pursing</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> until <b>his</b> {{moustache}} bristled {{and smiling}} in all his wrinkles. [...] "You know, Miss Morkan, the reason they are so fond of me is----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I say,' {{began the}} money-lender, <b>pursing</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> 'that {{there is not}} one rule of right living which these te-rains do not cause us to break. We sit, for example, side by side with all castes and peoples.' ...|$|R
60|$|The Vicar <b>pursed</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b> It {{was just}} like Bismarck to try and settle {{everything}} himself. He did not like that text; it seemed to cast an aspersion on himself.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Didn't {{you ever}} wonder who had put it there?' said Dan, {{stealing}} a glance at Puck's calm, dark face under the hood of his gown. Puck {{shook his head and}} <b>pursed</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|The cook {{leaned forward}} and {{regarded}} his col-league favourably; then he <b>pursed</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> and nodded significantly at an upper bunk from which the face of Tommy, pale and scared, looked anxiously down.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Stillwell {{was evidently}} much disturbed. He <b>pursed</b> up <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> savagely.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Fairlie arched <b>his</b> {{eyebrows and}} <b>pursed</b> up <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> in sarcastic surprise.|$|R

60|$|Feversham <b>pursed</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> and {{considered}} the speaker. Wentworth reentered, followed by the Earl's valet carrying an armful of garments. His lordship threw off his dressing-gown and stood forth in shirt and breeches.|$|E
6000|$|Bounce {{looked at}} his {{companion}} {{in silence for a}} few seconds; then he removed his pipe, <b>pursed</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> frowned heavily, looked at the ground, and repeated slowly, [...] "How does we make a capital foreground?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Cosimo {{shrugged and}} <b>pursed</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b> [...] "I {{will not go}} so far, since the matter of Ettore Cavalcanti's death does not {{immediately}} concern me. Besides, there is enough contained in the indictment as it stands." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her quizzically, then he <b>pursed</b> up <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> like Zephyrus, blowing across the snow.|$|R
60|$|At this direct {{question}} {{the oldest of}} the three brothers <b>pursed</b> up <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> in concentrated thought.|$|R
60|$|No {{words were}} spoken by the way. Orlando was {{too full of}} anxious {{anticipation}} to speak.

6000|$|The Parisian {{raised his}} eyebrows, and <b>pursed</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b> [...] "Then I deplore it," [...] said he. And {{now he had}} to endure the hardest trial of all. The stranger's {{expression}} changed to one of wondering scorn.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] Andre-Louis {{raised his}} eyebrows and <b>pursed</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> a man considering. He {{delivered}} himself slowly.

60|$|He winced; he <b>pursed</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> {{and shot}} {{a glance at}} La Fosse, who was deep in the mysteries of his volume. Then he drew towards him a sheet of paper, and, taking a quill, he sat toying with it.|$|E
60|$|His partner {{looked at}} him, <b>pursed</b> up <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> to whistle, then remembered {{and shook his}} head instead.|$|R

60|$|Little John and the Tanner {{had been}} {{watching}} all that passed, but {{when they saw the}} stranger drag the sapling up from the earth, and heard the rending and snapping of its roots, the Tanner <b>pursed</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> together, drawing his breath between them in a long inward whistle.|$|E
6000|$|The Seneschal <b>pursed</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> arched his brows, {{and slowly}} waved his podgy hands, a {{combination}} of grimace and gesture that said much or nothing.

60|$|Stephen glanced {{quickly at}} the door, and, <b>pursing</b> up <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> frowned. He threw the window open, and inhaled the night air.|$|R
