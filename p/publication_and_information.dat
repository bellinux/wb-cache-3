The approach of the Integrated <b>Publication</b> <b>and</b> <b>Information</b> Systems Institute (IPSI) to support electronic publishing is to build an integrated publication environment. The publi- cation of electronic documents demands enhanced support from publishing tools and imposes new challenges on database technology. Taking a hypermedia reference publication as an example, requirements on database technology for the production of electronic publications are discussed. Those can be met by using an object-oriented database management system like VODAK.

40|$|INTRODUCTION In the {{electronic}} publishing field today work {{concentrates on the}} production of longterm publications, which can be spread by distribution of data media like CD ROMs. This distribution path is relatively slow and expensive for short-term publications,whichmust be updated at short intervals. For these publications online access via networks is a more adequate way of distribution. At IPSI (Integrated <b>Publication</b> <b>and</b> <b>Information</b> Systems Institute) a publication system was built [...] - the MultiMedia Forum (MMF) [...] - which {{can be characterized as}} follows:. Editing and reading of issues is taking place via online access to a central database.. The issues consist of structured documents conforming to the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) [1, 2].. Documents can contain audio, video, text, images, and hypermedia links to other documents. Buildinga publishingsystem poses the q...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new technique}} for source-to-source code generation based on pattern matching and dynamic programming. This technique {{can be applied to}} all source and target languages which satisfy some requirements. The main differences to conventional approaches are the complexity of the target language, the handling of side effects caused by function calls and the introduction of temporaries. Code optimization is achieved by introducing a new cost-model. The technique allows an incremental development based on improvements of the target-library. These require only a modification of the rewriting rules since those are separated from the pattern matching algorithm. Experience of an successful application of our technique is given.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of the Internet and {{the ease with which}} {{information}} can be provided via such services as the World Wide Web has created a <b>publication</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> dissemination network with a highly chaotic component. It is questionable whether the current practices, services and tools will be sufficiently scalable to provide effective and efficient search and retrieval capabilities. This paper proposes the concept of the Network Information Broker (NIB) as a highly adaptable organisational unit, through which some order, quality assurance and scalability can be introduced into the Internet. The development of an NIB {{is part of a larger}} research project which will also consider the implementation and impact of the NIB. 1.

40|$|Google {{has become}} the {{embodiment}} of a search engine. But information professionals are aware that full text search engines like Google reveal evident deficiencies and are often not the best solution for efficient information search in technical information portals, intranets and enterprise content management systems. Pull text search engines are glued to the exact wording of a search phrase. On the one hand, they don't find information with different wording but same content because they don't recognize alternative denominations, phrasing or foreign-language translations to be synonym to the original wording. On the other hand, search results are not precise because full text search engines don't make a difference between homonymic but semantically different words. The semantic search engine Con-Weaver has been developed by the Fraunhofer Integrated <b>Publication</b> <b>and</b> <b>Information</b> Institute (Fraunhofer IPSI) at Darmstadt to address this problem. Con Weaver search solutions use a semantic network as search index instead of a full text index. Unlike most other ontology-based software products Con Weaver generates this semantic network in an automated information extraction process...|$|E

40|$|Information {{technology}} is rapidly evolving unmistakable characteristics. It {{is becoming more}} advanced, more popular, more standardized, simpler to develop and to deploy, and more empowering. The latter characteristic {{is perhaps the most}} important. Similar to the desktop publishing revolution triggered by the popularization of software and personal laser printers, the world-wide web has empowered the individual to easily share information. However, the web has gone beyond being an instant <b>publication</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> sharing tool. Publishers and users of that information quickly realized that they needed to be able to organize and find the information in a predictable manner. Thus, several large companies, such as Yahoo and Google, started developing technologies and web sites that provide tools to search the world-wide web and organize the information they find. Soon after, these database-linked technologies became available to individuals allowing them to store their own information in organized databases and offer dynamic web sites that search and fetch that information on the fly. The &quot;net effect &quot; is that the individual became empowered not only to publish information, but to do so in a searchable and dynamic manner that responds to the needs and queries of the user browsing that information. Researchers then started questioning this phenomenon: How can one ensure that online information is easily accessible, accurate, dependable, current, organized, standardized, searchable, secure, efficient, relevant, and connected? These issues would not have been open for investigation if it was not for the maturity an...|$|E

40|$|FEDERAL LIBRARIES {{are moved}} to {{cooperate}} {{by the same}} forces that influence other types of libraries. They face a dearth of resources, a heavy demand in {{a broad array of}} subjects from a vigorous and growing constituenty, and wide dispersion of resources. As all libraries do, they face the still-increasing volume of <b>publication</b> <b>and</b> <b>information,</b> and the seemingly inexorable inflation of the costs of all resources required for library service. Federal libraries are being pressed from another direction toward cooperative programs. Just as many segments of society look to the federal government and its agencies for planning, leadership, program support, and subsidy to solve social problems, a strong segment of the American library community anticipates federal library involvement in national library systems. To date, almost all but the national libraries have been shielded from this pressure by the bureaucracy of agency missions which do not yet recognize national library support as an essential activity. But the pressure to change is present and growing, particularly with the strength of new federal planning efforts, as in the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science. There are more than 2, 000 libraries in the federal government, ranging over a broad spectrum of types and purposes. Among them are the Library of Congress which is in fact, if not in law, a national library; the National Agricultural Library and the National Library of Medicine; six presidential libraries; general libraries which serve the cultural, informational, educational and recreational needs of the military agencies; academic libraries; libraries in elementary an...|$|E
40|$|Recent media {{interest}} has prompted much concern about community associated (CA) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections – particularly multidrug-resistant (MDR) CA-MRSA infections – in San Francisco (SF). A recent journal article and subsequent media attention {{have raised the}} issue of whether CA-MRSA infection is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) among gay men and other {{men who have sex with}} men (G/MSM). CA-MRSA infections are common, increasing in the community in general, and not limited to G/MSM. There is no evidence that CA-MRSA is transmitted by sex itself. Disease transmission can occur as a result of skin-to-skin contact or as a result of contact with a contaminated surface, with or without sex. This Health Advisory provides background on CA-MRSA infections, a summary of the recent <b>publication,</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> on clinical features, laboratory testing, treatment, infection control, and prevention of CA-MRSA infections. It also includes steps that the SF Department of Public Health (SFDPH) are taking to address CA-MRSA infections and references to additional resources, including FAQs, for the public. This Health Advisory is posted on the SFDPH website at www. sfdph. org/healthalert ACTIONS REQUESTED OF ALL CLINICIANS: 1. Consider CA-MRSA infection in all patients presenting with skin and soft-tissue infections. 2. Use antibiotics appropriately. Many purulent CA-MRSA infections can be treated with incision and draining (I&D) alone, without antibiotics. 3. If wound drainage is present or obtained, send specimen(s) for bacterial culture and sensitivity. 4. Follow treatment and infection control recommendations provided below. 5. Educate patients regarding ways to reduce risk of contracting or transmitting S. aureus infections. 6. Report outbreaks to the Communicable Disease Control Unit (CDCU) at (415) 554 - 2830...|$|E
