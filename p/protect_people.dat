5|$|In 2007, the USFWS {{concluded}} that hatchery-based reproduction {{efforts should be}} continued, along with monitoring of any population changes, to determine the effectiveness of human intervention. The 2007 findings also emphasized the need to determine the most likely areas of spawning, to identify any parasite or disease that may be impacting the reproductive capabilities of pallid sturgeon, and to examine engineering possibilities that may permit recreation of suitable habitats without reducing the USFWS's ability to <b>protect</b> <b>people</b> from harmful and destructive flooding, and to maintain its ability to provide adequate water impoundment for irrigation and recreation purposes.|$|E
5|$|International trade usually {{results in}} a high {{mortality}} rate during transit, between 30% and 90%. Slow lorises also experience many health problems {{as a result of}} both local and international trade. To give the impression that the primates are tame and appropriate pets for children, to <b>protect</b> <b>people</b> from their potentially toxic bite, or to deceive buyers into thinking the animal is a baby, animal dealers either pull the front teeth with pliers or wire cutters or they cut them off with nail cutters. This results in severe bleeding, which sometimes causes shock or death, and frequently leads to dental infection, which is fatal in 90% of all cases. Without their teeth, the animals are no longer able to fend for themselves in the wild, and must remain in captivity for life. The slow lorises found in animal markets are usually underweight and malnourished, and have had their fur dyed, which complicates species identification at rescue centers. As many as 95% of the slow lorises rescued from the markets die of dental infection or improper care.|$|E

25|$|There are a {{few simple}} {{measures}} to <b>protect</b> <b>people</b> in the OR from scatter radiation, thus lower their dose. Awareness is one critical issue, otherwise the available protection tools might be neglected.

The later may be replaced by a ceiling-suspended lead glass panel. Additional lead curtains can be installed at the table side to protect the lower body region. Even more restrictive rules apply to pregnant staff members.|$|E
25|$|Generally speaking, {{avalanches}} follow drainages down-slope, frequently sharing drainage features with summertime watersheds. At {{and below}} tree line, avalanche paths through drainages are well defined by vegetation boundaries called trim lines, which occur where avalanches have removed trees and prevented regrowth of large vegetation. Engineered drainages, {{such as the}} avalanche dam on Mount Stephen in Kicking Horse Pass, have been constructed to <b>protect</b> <b>people</b> and property by redirecting the flow of avalanches. Deep debris deposits from avalanches will collect in catchments at the terminus of a run out, such as gullies and river beds.|$|E

25|$|Network Rail {{had planned}} to {{demolish}} the arched section to the north-east of Paddington station, known as Span 4.

Span 4 was {{to be replaced by}} an office block over the rails but it was later decided that the structure would be restored.
