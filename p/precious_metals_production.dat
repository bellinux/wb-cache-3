40|$|Currently, {{investigations}} undertaken {{on different}} types of gold bearing ore deposits show {{that the type of}} deposit plays an important role for the selection of mineral processing technologies in gold and other <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> <b>production.</b> During recent years, studies on the discovery and growth of new gold deposits have been gradually progressing in many provinces of Turkey and this will undoubtedly contribute to development of new technologies in other metal mining industries. Recently, it has been established that approximately 15 - 20 % of gold recovery is realised by physical and 80 - 85 % of that is carried out by chemical and biological processes. Chemical and sometimes biological processes are prefered due to low cost and simplicity.

Existing players provide the main body and the interface separately. Typically the interface material is profitable as opposed to the main body. In order to get in this business, Yamamoto Precious Company is developing unified material to integrate two parts.
