40|$|AbstractWe study {{operators}} {{acting on}} a tensor product Hilbert space and investigate their <b>product</b> numerical <b>range,</b> <b>product</b> numerical radius and separable numerical range. Concrete bounds for the <b>product</b> numerical <b>range</b> for Hermitian operators are derived. <b>Product</b> numerical <b>range</b> of a non-Hermitian operator forms {{a subset of the}} standard numerical range containing the barycenter of the spectrum. While the latter set is convex, the <b>product</b> <b>range</b> needs not to be convex nor simply connected. The <b>product</b> numerical <b>range</b> of a tensor product is equal to the Minkowski <b>product</b> of numerical <b>ranges</b> of individual factors...|$|R

25|$|Forestry is an {{important}} economic resource for Papua New Guinea but the industry uses low and semi-intensive technological inputs. As a result, <b>product</b> <b>ranges</b> are limited to sawed timber, veneer, plywood, block board, moulding, poles and posts and wood chips. Only a few limited finished products are exported. Lack of automated machinery, coupled with inadequately trained local technical personnel, {{are some of the}} obstacles to introducing automated machinery and design.

25|$|Occasionally {{confusion}} {{has arisen}} due to Marshall's method of naming each amp model, especially {{during its first}} few decades, when it was distributed under Rose-Morris. Early Amplifier models were simply named after their catalogue number, so for example the 1962 blues breaker was item one thousand nine hundred and sixty two in the Rose-Morris catalogue. Later amplifiers were given range designations as well as model numbers, which often indicated information about the amplifier itself, for example the JCM2000 range of amplifiers had models such as the TSL100 (Triple Super Lead 100W) and combo amplifiers like the TSL122 (Triple Super Lead with 2×12-inch Celestion speakers) other <b>product</b> <b>ranges</b> use similar descriptive model numbers. Often Speaker cabinets designed to suit a particular range will give a prefix before the speaker description such as JVMC212 (JVM cabinet 2×12-inch Celestion speakers) or a suffix C to denote a combo variant of an amplifier such as the Vintage Modern 2266C (Vintage Modern 2 channel 2× KT66 valves Combo).|$|E
