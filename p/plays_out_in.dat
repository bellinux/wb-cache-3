5|$|The {{version for}} {{personal}} computers (PC) is an action role-playing game which plays from a top-down perspective. Controlling Nakajima, the player explores the labyrinthine levels of a dungeon populated by enemies. Combat <b>plays</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> real time, with Nakajima fighting demons using both short-range melee attacks and ranged magic attacks. Each {{section of the}} dungeon ends in a powerful boss character.|$|E
5|$|The Adventure of Link <b>plays</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a two-mode dynamic. The overworld, {{the area}} where the {{majority}} of the action occurs in other The Legend of Zelda games, is still from a top-down perspective, but it now serves as a hub to the other areas. Whenever Link enters a new area such as a town, the game switches to a side-scrolling view. This mode is where most of the action takes place, and, with the exception of traveling across lava and water, it is the only mode in which Link can take damage and be killed.|$|E
5|$|Battles use a turn-based battle system, with {{a limited}} number of player units and enemy units each taking turns and moving across a grid-based battlefield: battles are won by the player {{defeating}} key enemy units such as commanders and other boss characters. In battle, the game transitions to a dedicated battle arena, where the battle <b>plays</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> real-time. Each action yields experience points (EXP), and when the character earns 100 EXP, they level up, their health increases, and their class-specified statistics are randomly raised. During missions, towns and secret vendors can be visited, where new items such as healing potions, weapons and armor can be purchased. Weapons and armor are specific to different characters, and each weapon has a limited lifespan before breaking when it reaches its limit. Currency is limited to certain scripted or player-driven events, or wagering on arena battles. If a character falls in battle, they are subjected to permanent death, removing them from subsequent missions {{and the rest of the}} storyline. The game ends if Marth falls in battle.|$|E

25|$|Pullman portrays {{life after}} death very {{differently}} from the Christian concept of heaven: In the third book, the afterlife <b>plays</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a bleak underworld, similar to the Greek vision of the afterlife, wherein harpies torment people until Lyra and Will descend into {{the land of the}} dead. At their intercession, the harpies agree to stop tormenting the dead souls, and instead receive the true stories of the dead in exchange for leading them again to the upper world. When the dead souls emerge, they dissolve into atoms and merge with the environment.|$|E
25|$|There are {{distinct}} and notably large differences between Borderline and C-PTSD {{and while there}} are some similarities – predominantly in terms of issues with attachment (though this <b>plays</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> completely different ways) and trouble regulating strong emotional effect (often feel pain vividly), the disorders are completely different in nature – especially considering that C-PTSD is always a response to trauma rather than a personality disorder. In addition, C-PTSD is not a personality disorder – rather it is often a case of survival reactions to trauma becoming a fundamental aspect of the personality, in response to living with a personality disordered individual.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the series}} focuses on {{attempts}} by Naar's minions to use remnants {{of the power of}} Agarash the Damned, Naar's greatest champion and predecessor to the Darklords. The series is set in Southern Magnamund, center of Agarash's empire, which was not featured in the earlier series. In Voyage of the Moonstone, the new protagonist is sent to the Isle of Lorn to return the Moonstone to its creators, the Shianti. However, this book ends midway during the trip, in Elzian. The second part of this adventure <b>plays</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> The Buccaneers of Shadaki. After completing this quest, the Grand Master is sent to the Isle of Sheasu to persuade Prince Karvas, heir of the King of Siyen, to return to his homeland to claim the throne before the evil Baron Sadanzo takes it in Mydnight's Hero.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of [...] "Silvia" [...] was generally positive; many critics deemed it the album's centerpiece and criticized its early placement {{as the third}} track on Miike Snow. The single achieved minor chart success in the United Kingdom; it became the band's second entry on the UK Dance Chart, peaking at number 16. However, it missed the top 100 of the UK Singles Chart as it only reached number 154. The accompanying music video was directed by Marcus Söderlund and <b>plays</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a post-apocalyptic setting.|$|E
500|$|Marcus Söderlund {{directed}} the accompanying music video for [...] "Silvia". It premiered exclusively on NME website in December 2009. A writer for Complex commented, [...] "The vid {{is kind of}} dramatic and hard to make sense of, {{but what do you}} expect from a band like this?" [...] The video <b>plays</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a post-apocalyptic world. It begins with the band's three members waking up from sleeping {{in the middle of a}} street, appearing to be homeless. The men then walk way in the woods while shots of homeless people are interspersed. Several people are seen carrying torches in the woods and are soon joined by the band. They then set fire to a large wooden version of a jackalope and the video ends as it bursts into flames.|$|E
500|$|The game's story <b>plays</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> episodes, {{similar to}} a {{television}} series, with many events told out of sequence. On Christmas Eve of 2012, monstrous creatures dubbed as [...] "Babels" [...] appear in New York City. Along with lifeforms spawned by them called the Twisted, they lay waste {{to the city and}} consume any human in their path. By the following year, an investigatory team known as the CTI (Counter Twisted Investigation) has been formed. One of the CTI members is Aya Brea, who was found outside St. Thomson's Cathedral in 2010, just before the Babels and Twisted began appearing. Dr. Hyde Bohr, Chief of the CTI, finds that Aya is suffering from amnesia, and that her personality has changed. After taking Aya in, the CTI discovered that she was capable of transferring her soul from body to body independent of time, an ability dubbed [...] "Overdive", which enables her to fight the Twisted.|$|E

500|$|Vesperia uses a {{variation}} on the series' trademark action-oriented Linear Motion Battle System (LMBS), which <b>plays</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a similar way to a fighting game. The variation used in Vesperia is called the [...] "Evolved Flex-Range LMBS". Battles take place in an isolated battle arena within the environment, with the battle party being made up of one player-controlled character and three characters controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). The AI commands can be customized from a set of skills, with their assigned tasks affecting their actions and placement on the battlefield. Vesperia also features a local four-player multiplayer option: up to four players can connect to a single Xbox 360 console through both wired and wireless controllers. While no online multiplayer is available, players can use Xbox Live to post their respective scores, including damage chains and consecutive hit numbers, on online leaderboards. The boards can be updated by players while saving the game.|$|E
500|$|In battle, {{the player}} {{controls}} Zael alone, {{with the rest}} of the party being controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI) and directed by player commands. Parties are composed of up to six characters, each with five [...] "lives", with them automatically reviving after a certain time if Zael cannot revive them manually. The attack directions of both party characters and enemies are represented by lines connecting the different characters. Combat <b>plays</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> real-time, with attacks either happening automatically when a character is within range or manually. Actions such as dodging and movement are done manually. Blocking and actions such as vaulting over low obstacles are performed by holding the B button. Zael can also move to take cover behind objects, which allows them to break an enemy's line of sight on them or creep along walls. During combat, a character's Tension gauge will fill, enabling the performance of special moves: these can vary from dealing damage to enemies across a wide area to reviving unconscious allies.|$|E
500|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Imagine is a free-to-play massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing game (MMORPG) set in post-apocalyptic Tokyo. Players {{take control}} of a [...] "Demon Buster", an avatar whose gender and appearance are selected by the player. Using the tower city Shinjuku Babel as a base, players explore various locations including the surface and underground areas. In Shinjuku Babel, players accept quests from non-player characters (NPCs); switch out their equipment and weapons, and buy new items from shops run by NPCs. While most of the items can be bought using in-game currency, higher-status items can be bought for real money. Players can explore on their own, or team up in groups to take on more difficult parts of the game. The game is delivered in [...] "chapters" [...] that advance the story, along with various optional sidequests that grant experience points and in-game currency upon completion. Combat in Imagine <b>plays</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> real-time in the game's environments, with attack options varying from short-range melee to long-range physical and magical attacks. As with other MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft, various abilities are mapped to face buttons and each ability has a cooldown timer. Real-time commands given by the player enables their avatar to block, dodge and counterattack. Different enemies are resistant or weak to different weapons and abilities.|$|E

2500|$|A {{variety of}} Romantic {{interests}} were again synthesized in The Murder of the Bishop of Liège (1829). It also borrowed from a literary source, this time Scott, and depicts {{a scene from}} the Middle Ages, that of the murder of Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Liège amidst an orgy sponsored by his captor, William de la Marck. Set in an immense vaulted interior which Delacroix based on sketches of the Palais de Justice in Rouen and Westminster Hall, the drama <b>plays</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> chiaroscuro, organized around a brilliantly lit stretch of tablecloth. In 1855, a critic described the painting's vibrant handling as [...] "Less finished than a painting, more finished than a sketch, The Murder of the Bishop of Liège was left by the painter at that supreme moment when one more stroke of the brush would have ruined everything".|$|E

2500|$|Several episodes, {{including}} the pilot, {{begin with a}} cold open, finding MacGyver already on a mission.

In many episodes, the opening sequence occurs after the opening credits and often does not involve MacGyver on a mission but rather in a situation used for character development.
