The majority of assets located was expected be the international equivalent of standard checking and savings accounts, where the applicable interest was less than 0.5% during 2015. The majority of that income is already (by tax treaty) attributable to the country where it resides. (IRS Form 1116 is normally used to credit foreign taxes upon <b>passive</b> <b>income.)</b> Another source from which FATCA intends to raise revenue is {{in the identification of}} a wider population of US persons. However, the majority (82%) of overseas US persons filing owe no tax to the US (due to tax treaties). At the congressional hearing on 26 April 2017, Congressman Mark Meadows stated that according to FATCA's drafters themselves, FATCA would, at most, reduce tax evasion by less than 1% (i.e. recoup less than $1billion out of an estimated $100billion in lost revenue). In contrast, he said, normal enforcement activities create a return of $20 for every $1 spent. Because $200million is being spent to implement FATCA in FY2017, the IRS commissioner’s own estimates show that just shifting the money from FATCA to general enforcement would increase tax revenues by over $1billion.|$|E
2500|$|Under U.S. tax law, U.S. persons (regardless {{of country}} of residence) are {{generally}} {{required to report}} and pay U.S. federal income tax on income from all sources. The U.S. is unique in taxing not only non-resident citizens but also non-resident [...] "U.S. Persons for tax purposes". The law requires U.S. citizens living abroad to pay U.S. taxes on foreign income if the foreign tax should be less than U.S. tax ("taxing up"), independently within each category of earned income and <b>passive</b> <b>income.</b> For this reason, the increased reporting requirements of FATCA have had extensive implications for U.S. citizens living abroad. Taxpayer identification numbers and source withholding are also now used to enforce asset reporting requirements upon non-resident U.S. citizens. For example, mandatory withholding can be required via FATCA when a U.S. payor cannot confirm the non-U.S. status of a foreign payee.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the impact of tax sparing provisions on the location choices of multinational enterprises. Special attention is paid to the economic in°uence of tax sparing because the OECD proposal to reconsider the inclusion of this provision in bilateral tax treaties is highly controversial. An empirical analysis is proposed in order to apprehend the effects of tax sparing on both credit and exempt investors, since they do not benefit from the same advantages provided by tax sparing. Using data from 54 developing countries over the 1990 - 2000, and distinguishing Japanese credit investors from French exempt investors, we first find that the asymmetrical sensitivity between exempt and credit investors relative to foreign corporate taxes is considerably reduced with tax measures accounting for tax sparing. Second, we find that tax sparing provisions have a favorable impact on the location choices of credit investors and have no influence on the location choices of exempt investors. Third, the non-robust significance of both a tax sparing adjusted effective interest tax rate and effective royalties tax rate tends to suggest that tax incentives on <b>passive</b> <b>incomes</b> are not really considered by both credit and exempt investors when making the decision of where to invest. foreign direct investment, tax sparing, credit and exempt tax systems, corporate taxes, interest and royalty taxes...|$|R

40|$|The key {{topic of}} the paper is {{determined}} by the crisis situation of the nowadays economic model. Capitalism is the dominant economic form in the global economy. Varieties of capitalism exist ranging from state capitalism to neo liberalism but all are pervaded by a dominant theme, an egocentric economy model or ego-economics. This model is underlain by postulates of the need for a continued growth spurred by end-use. The realisation of this model is provided by monetary approaches and stimulation of consumer demand as the main driver of economic growth. The key tools for stimulating demand in this model of economy are competition, information impact on the consumer consciousness and choices, the massive accessibility of credit, the massive accessibility of financial markets and financial instruments, the actualisation of <b>passive</b> <b>incomes</b> as opposed to creative labour, and other degradation triggering factors. The crowning part of this model is the debt economy of consumption of societies of individualists who do not share traditional systems of values but are guided by illusory, temporary, short-term objectives. Thus, the egocentric economy model established dominance in relation to the ecological economy model, exposing a bulk of contradictions in principles underlying the system and promotes unsustainability. The future turned out to be in jeopardy [...] . The paper contrasts ego-economics and ecoeconomics, traces of the emergence of the first one and the need for the second one as a necessary condition for long-term sustainability...|$|R
50|$|The goal {{of social}} {{ownership}} {{is to eliminate}} {{the distinction between the}} class of private owners who are the recipients of <b>passive</b> property <b>income</b> and workers who are the recipients of labor income (wages, salaries and commissions), so that the surplus product (or economic profits in the case of market socialism) belong either to society as a whole or to the members of a given enterprise. Social ownership would enable productivity gains from labor automation to progressively reduce the average length of the working day instead of creating job insecurity and unemployment. Reduction of necessary work time is central to the Marxist concept of human freedom and overcoming alienation, a concept widely shared by Marxist and non-Marxist socialists alike.|$|R

The practical implication is that countries are not free to adopt any international tax rules they please, but rather operate {{in the context of the}} regime, which changes in the same ways international law changes over time. Thus, unilateral action is possible, but is also restricted, and countries are generally reluctant to take unilateral actions that violate the basic norms that underlie the regime. Those norms are the single tax principle (i. e., that income should be taxed once- not more and not less) and the benefits principle (i. e., that active business income should be taxed primarily at source, and <b>passive</b> investment <b>income</b> primarily at residence) ...|$|R
