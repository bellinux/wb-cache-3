50|$|Cold traps also {{refer to}} the {{application}} of cooled surfaces or baffles to prevent oil vapours from flowing from a pump and into a chamber. In such a case, a baffle or a section of pipe containing a number of cooled vanes, will {{be attached to the}} inlet of an existing pumping system. By cooling the baffle, either with a cryogen such as liquid nitrogen, or by use of an electrically driven <b>Peltier</b> <b>element,</b> oil vapour molecules that strike the baffle vanes will condense and thus be removed from the pumped cavity.|$|E
50|$|Cooling the PbS elements, {{for example}} using liquid {{nitrogen}} or a <b>Peltier</b> <b>element</b> system, shifts its sensitivity range to between approximately 2 and 4 μm. Objects that emit radiation in these wavelengths {{still have to}} be quite hot—several hundred degrees Celsius—but not as hot as those detectable by uncooled sensors. (Other compounds used for this purpose include indium antimonide (InSb) and mercury-cadmium telluride (HgCdTe), which have somewhat better properties for detecting the longer IR wavelengths.) The high dielectric constant of PbS leads to relatively slow detectors (compared to silicon, germanium, InSb, or HgCdTe).|$|E
50|$|<b>Peltier</b> <b>elements</b> are {{commonly}} used in consumer products. For example, <b>Peltier</b> <b>elements</b> are used in camping, portable coolers, cooling electronic components and small instruments.

A camping/car type electric cooler can typically reduce the temperature by up to 20 °C (36 °F) below the ambient temperature.

50|$|When a gas flows over a chilled surface, or chilled mirror, if {{the surface}} is cold enough, the {{available}} moisture will start to condense on it. The exact temperature at which this condensation first occurs {{is known as the}} dew point. All chilled-mirror devices are based on the same basic method: the temperature of the mirror is reduced from high to low, and the temperature at which condensation is observed is reported as the dew point. By obtaining the dew point temperature, one can calculate moisture content in the gas. The mirror temperature can be regulated by either the flow of a refrigerant over the mirror or by a thermoelectric cooler also known as a <b>peltier</b> <b>element.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} used in {{a typical}} (active) liquid cooling system for computers is identical to that {{used in a}}n automobile's internal combustion engine, with the water being circulated by a water pump through a waterblock mounted on the CPU (and sometimes additional components as GPU and northbridge) and out to a heat exchanger, typically a radiator. The radiator is itself sometimes cooled additionally {{by means of a}} fan. Besides a fan, it could possibly also be cooled by other means, such as a Peltier cooler (although Peltier elements are most commonly placed directly on top of the hardware to be cooled, and the coolant is used to conduct the heat away from the hot side of the <b>Peltier</b> <b>element).</b> A coolant reservoir is often also connected to the system.|$|E
5000|$|Different {{types of}} devices {{can be used}} to produce the {{physiological}} changes. Of the bodily organs, the heart plays a particularly important role in our emotional experience. The heart imitator HaptiHeart produces special heartbeat patterns according to emotion to be conveyed or elicited (sadness is associated with slightly intense heartbeat, anger with quick and violent heartbeat, fear with intense heart rate). False heart beat feedback can be directly interpreted as a real heart beat, so it can change the emotional perception. HaptiButterfly reproduces “butterflies in your stomach” (the fluttery or tickling feeling felt by people experiencing love) through arrays of vibration motors attached to the user’s abdomen. HaptiShiver sends “shivers up and down your spine” through a row of vibration motors. HaptiTemper sends “chills up and down your spine” through both cold airflow from a fan and the cold side of a <b>Peltier</b> <b>element.</b> HaptiTemper is also intended for simulation of warmth on the human skin to evoke either pleasant feeling or aggression ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} thermal cyclers {{were designed}} for use with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Since this enzyme is destroyed during each heating step of the amplification process, new enzyme had to be added every cycle. This led to a cumbersome machine based on an automated pipettor, with open reaction tubes. Later, the PCR process was adapted {{to the use of}} thermostable DNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus, which greatly simplified the design of the thermal cycler. While in some old machines the block is submerged in an oil bath to control temperature, in modern PCR machines a <b>Peltier</b> <b>element</b> is commonly used. Quality thermal cyclers often contain silver blocks to achieve fast temperature changes and uniform temperature throughout the block. Other cyclers have multiple blocks with high heat capacity, each of which is kept at a constant temperature, and the reaction tubes are moved between them by means of an automated process. Miniaturized thermal cyclers have been created in which the reaction mixture moves via channel through hot and cold zones on a microfluidic chip. Thermal cyclers designed for quantitative PCR have optical systems which enable fluorescence to be monitored during reaction cycling.|$|E
