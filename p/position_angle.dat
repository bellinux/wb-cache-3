This source was confirmed to be M87 by 1953, and the linear relativistic jet emerging from {{the core of the}} galaxy was suggested as the cause. This jet extended from the core at a <b>position</b> <b>angle</b> of 260° to an angular distance of 20″ with an angular width of 2″. In 1969–70, a strong component of the radio emission was found to closely align with the optical source of the jet.|$|E
25|$|As {{the stars}} of Alpha Centauri {{approach}} the Solar System, the measured proper motion and trigonometric parallax slowly increase. Changes are also observed {{in the size of}} the semi-major axis of the orbital ellipse, increasing by 0.03arcsec per century. This small effect is gradually decreasing until the star system is at its closest to Earth, and is then reversed as the distance increases again. Consequently, the observed position angles of the stars are subject to changes in the orbital elements over time, as first determined by W. H. van den Bos in 1926.=μα×sinα×(t−to), where; α= right ascension (in degrees), μα is the common proper motion (cpm.) expressed in degrees, and θ and θo are the current <b>position</b> <b>angle</b> and calculated <b>position</b> <b>angle</b> at the different epochs. Some slight differences of about 0.5 percent in the measured proper motions are caused by Alpha Centauri AB's orbital motion.|$|E
25|$|Viewed from Earth, the {{apparent}} orbit of this binary star means that its separation and <b>position</b> <b>angle</b> (PA) are in continuous change throughout its projected orbit. Observed stellar positions in 2010 {{are separated by}} 6.74arcsec through the PA of 245.7°, reducing to 6.04arcsec through 251.8° in 2011. The closest recent approach was in February 2016, at 4.0arcsec through 300°. The observed maximum separation of these stars is about 22arcsec, while the minimum distance is 1.7arcsec. The widest separation occurred during February 1976 and the next will be in January 2056.|$|E

25|$|The <b>position</b> <b>angle</b> of the {{secondary}} {{with respect to the}} primary is measured, together with the angular distance between the two stars. The time of observation is also recorded. After a sufficient number of observations are recorded over a period of time, they are plotted in polar coordinates with the primary star at the origin, and the most probable ellipse is drawn through these points such that the Keplerian law of areas is satisfied. This ellipse is known as the apparent ellipse, and is the projection of the actual elliptical orbit of {{the secondary}} with respect to the primary on the plane of the sky. From this projected ellipse the complete elements of the orbit may be computed, where the semi-major axis can only be expressed in angular units unless the stellar parallax, and hence the distance, of the system is known.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, the Hubble Space Telescope's Faint Object Camera {{captured}} an ultraviolet {{image with}} a resolution superior to that obtained by ground-based interferometers—the first conventional-telescope image (or [...] "direct-image" [...] in NASA terminology) {{of the disk}} of another star. Because ultraviolet light is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, observations at these wavelengths are best performed by space telescopes. Like earlier pictures, this image contained a bright patch indicating a region in the southwestern quadrant [...] hotter than the stellar surface. Subsequent ultraviolet spectra taken with the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph suggested that the hot spot was one of Betelgeuse's poles of rotation.

The line {{intensity}} of the green coronal line and the continuum intensity are derived from the filter and white light photographs of the solar corona obtained during the 1980 total solar eclipse. Ratio of the line to continuum intensity is plotted against the radial distance r(=R/R 0, R 0 is the solar radius), in various <b>position</b> <b>angles.</b> A simple model assuming an electron density dependence {{of the line and}} continuum intensities suggests a dominant collisional mechanism for the excitation of the line in the innermost regions (~ 1. 4 R 0).

The outer atmosphere has a temperature of approximately 6,220K, which is relatively cool for a white dwarf. As all white dwarfs steadily radiate away their heat over time, this temperature can be used to estimate its age, thought to be around 3billion years.|$|E
2500|$|Regardless {{of whether}} {{polarization}} state is represented using geometric parameters or Jones vectors, {{implicit in the}} parameterization is {{the orientation of the}} coordinate frame.
