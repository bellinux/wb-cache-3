50|$|There are {{two primary}} ways to perform fault {{management}} - these are active and passive. <b>Passive</b> <b>fault</b> management {{is done by}} collecting alarms from devices (normally via SNMP traps) when something happens in the devices. In this mode, the fault management system only knows if a device it is monitoring is intelligent enough to generate an error and report it to the management tool. However, if the device being monitored fails completely or locks up, it won't throw an alarm and the problem will not be detected. Active fault management addresses this issue by actively monitoring devices via tools such as ping {{to determine if the}} device is active and responding. If the device stops responding, active monitoring will throw an alarm showing the device as unavailable and allows for the proactive correction of the problem.|$|E

This thesis focuses on <b>passive</b> <b>fault</b> detection for SUTs whose specifications are given in finite state machine (FSM) and extended finite state machine (EFSM) models, and proposes {{a new approach to}} FSM and EFSM-based <b>passive</b> <b>fault</b> detection. Compared with previous approaches for FSM-based <b>passive</b> <b>fault</b> detection based on the approach in [Lee 97], this proposed approach for FSM-based <b>passive</b> <b>fault</b> detection has better performance with respect to computational complexity and provides more information about possible starting state and possible trace during the <b>passive</b> <b>fault</b> detection without the need for additional post-processing. We analyzed the worst case time complexity of the algorithms and gave results of experiments to estimate the average case time complexity of these algorithms. This proposed approach for EFSM-based <b>passive</b> <b>fault</b> detection is derived from the proposed approach for FSM-based <b>passive</b> <b>fault</b> detection. It also provides information about possible starting state and possible trace at the end of <b>passive</b> <b>fault</b> detection; and utilizes a Hybrid method which combines the use of both Interval Refinement and Simplex methods for performance improvement during <b>passive</b> <b>fault</b> detection. Through experiments, we show that, compared with using only the Interval Refinement method or only the Simplex method, the Hybrid method guarantees the correctness of results with a reasonable time cost...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{focus on}} the problem of <b>passive</b> robust <b>fault</b> {{detection}} using non-linear models that include parameter uncertainty. The non-linear model considered here is described by a Group Method of Data Handling Neural Network (GMDHNN). The problem of <b>passive</b> robust <b>fault</b> detection using models including parameter uncertainty has been mainly addressed checking if the measured behaviour is inside the region of possible behaviours following what will be called in the following a forward test. In this paper, a backward test based on checking if there exists a parameter in the uncertain parameter set that is consistent with the measured behaviour is introduced. This test is implemented using interval constraint satisfaction algorithms which can perform efficiently in deciding if the measured state is consistent with the GMDHNN model and its associated uncertainty. Finally, this approach is tested on the servoactuator proposed as a FDI benchmark in the European Project DAMADICS. Copyright © 2005 IFA...|$|R

The AD {{separates}} kyanite and sillimanite grade gneisses and tremolite + clinopyroxene ± hornblendebearing marble-calc-silicates of the Greater Himalayan Sequence (GHS) below from unmetamorphosed Palaeozoic-Mesozoic sedimentary rocks of the Tethyan sedimentary zone above. It was active at ca. 22 - 18 Ma during south-vergent ductile extrusion (channel fl ow) and exhumation of the Himalayan midcrust footwall. Restoration of the STD system suggests around 80 - 100 km of southward extrusion of the footwall gneisses relative to the Tethyan hanging-wall rocks. Folds in the hanging wall of the AD were formed prior to normal faulting, but axial planes are curved into alignment with the shear zone suggesting extrusion of the metamorphic footwall rocks beneath a <b>passive</b> roof <b>fault.</b> North-vergent recumbent backfolds in the Nilgiri-Tukuche peaks were enhanced by backsliding during footwall extrusion, although this does not indicate "orogenic collapse," lowering of surface elevation, or decreasing crustal thickness because new material was continually being underthrust from the south. Axial planes of backfolds are curved and progressively rotate from subvertical in the north to subhorizontal immediately above the AD. Low-angle normal faults in the Himalaya were active during the Early Miocene, concomitantly with thrusting at deeper structural levels along the Main Central Thrust (MCT) zone. The <b>passive</b> normal <b>faults</b> and ductile shear zone were initiated at low angles aided by partial melting and ductile fl ow within the GHS.

40|$|In recent years, fault {{tolerant}} flight control systems have gained an increased interest for high performance military aircraft {{as well as}} civil aircraft. Fault tolerant control systems {{can be described as}} either active or passive. An active {{fault tolerant}} control system has to either reconfigure or adapt the controller in response to a failure. One approach is to reconfigure the controller based upon detection and identification of the failure. Another approach is to use direct adaptive control to adjust the controller without explicitly identifying the failure. In contrast, a <b>passive</b> <b>fault</b> tolerant control system uses a fixed controller which achieves acceptable performance for a presumed set of failures.

Secondly, a systematic FTC strategy which can coordinate various FTC methods is designed to compensate for failures depending on the fault types and severity levels. Unlike former stand-alone passive FTC or active FTC, our proposed FTC scheme can compensate for faults in a way of condition-based maintenance (CBM), and especially consider the fatal failures that traditional FTC techniques cannot accommodate to avoid the crashing of UAVs.

The algorithms are mainly based on voltage or current information. With large CCVT error correct direction estimation is a challenging task for many relaying algorithm.

Distance relay algorithms are implemented with CCVT transient detection logic [24]. With such facility, new solutions can be provided to avoid relay malfunction. To obtain subsidence transient at the secondary side of CCVT, a new CCVT model is developed in EMTDC/PSCAD environment considering the nonlinear elements. Next, a current based approach is proposed which computes the phase angle difference between positive sequence post fault and prefault current.
