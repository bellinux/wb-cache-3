40|$|In the U. S., transfer-pricing regulations, {{which are}} {{designed}} to limit multinationals' <b>profit</b> <b>shift</b> activities, have been tightened in recent years. The new regulations have been enacted in response to concerns that foreign companies are not contributing adequate tax revenues. Against this background, the paper examines the implications of competing governments who maximize tax revenues from multinational firms and use transfer-pricing regulations as strategic variables. The result is a non-cooperative equilibrium that implies a double taxation of corporate profits and a depressed level of international trade. Cooperation between governments could potentially increase both tax revenues and trade. ...|$|R

40|$|The OECD Guidelines {{stipulates}} that a business restructuring resulting in <b>shifted</b> <b>profit</b> potential not automatically implies that compensation {{should be paid}} between the restructuring parties. This thesis examines when <b>shifted</b> <b>profit</b> potential should be remunerated {{from the perspective of}} the fictive Swedish distributor Enterprise A which is facing a business restructuring. The arm’s length principle does not require any remuneration for the mere <b>shift</b> of <b>profit</b> potential when applying the principle on business restructurings. Instead, the questions are whether there has been a transfer of something of value; or a termination or significant renegotiation of the current agreement. In the context of remuneration for <b>shifted</b> <b>profit</b> potential the questions can be rephrased to whether considerable assets and/or rights have been transferred which carry considerable profit potential that should be remunerated. And, whether the arm’s length principle requires remuneration to be paid by reference to the concept of “options realistically available”. Enterprise A’s <b>shifted</b> <b>profit</b> potential could be remunerated and thus have tax consequences if there are other options realistically available for the entity apart from entering into the business restructuring. Enterprise A’s bargain power would then have been greater and consequently the chances of being remunerated as well. Further, Enterprise A could be remunerated as a result of the <b>shifted</b> <b>profit</b> potential if the entity takes title to transferred marketing intangibles that can be identified and assessed valuable. The <b>shifted</b> <b>profit</b> potential should as well be remunerated and thus have tax consequences if the parties in Corporate Group C have included a compensation clause in their contract, and the clause can be assessed as at arm’s length when considering what independent parties would have agreed upon. ...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This study {{examines}} transfer pricing behaviour {{for the purpose}} of <b>shifting</b> <b>profits</b> between national tax jurisdictions with different rates of profit tax {{in the context of the}} Saudi oil and gas sector as well as that of several other countries (i. e., Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Korea, Japan, Kuwait, Norway, Poland, Sweden, UK and US).

40|$|Globalisation and the {{transition}} from national to international markets raise many questions, and one important question is whether one should support national champions. In this talk {{it is argued that}} such a policy – for example through a lax competition policy – will quite often be misguided. It can be detrimental to national welfare, because it results in a <b>profit</b> <b>shift</b> out of the country. A lack of competitive pressure in the domestic market caused by a national champion policy may slow down technological change and result in higher prices. It is argued that in an open economy it is less scope for a lax competition policy which permits national champions than in a closed economy. The experience in the Norwegian farmed salmon industry the last 25 years illustrates the success when not pursuing a national champion policy, while the experience in the Norwegian cement market since the 20 s illustrates the loss associated with a lax competition policy. 1 This talk was held at the 25 th anniversary for the CISEP- Research Centre on the Portuguese Economy – o...|$|R
5000|$|In {{recognition}} {{of the fact that}} corporate business is increasingly conducted on a national and international basis, it is the intent of the general assembly to adopt a unitary combined system of income tax reporting for corporations, and {{as an integral part of}} this proposal, to lower the corporate income tax rates. Vermont's separate accounting system is inadequate to measure accurately the income of a corporation with non-Vermont affiliates and creates tax disadvantages for Vermont corporations which compete with multistate and multinational corporations doing business in Vermont. It is the intent of the general assembly, in adopting a unitary combined reporting system, to put all corporations doing business in Vermont on an equal income tax footing, and with the revenue from the expanded and more accurate tax base, to lower Vermont's corporate income tax rates.The enabling statute, however, excludes [...] "overseas business organizations" [...] from the taxable combined group so water's edge instead of worldwide combined reporting is adopted. Therefore, purely domestic businesses (i.e. national multi-state corporations) are subject to tax on 100% of their taxable profits, U.S. based multinational corporations are subject to tax on 100% of their reported U.S. profits plus foreign profits via repatriated dividends from foreign subsidiaries (if and when repatriated), and foreign based multinational corporations are subject to tax on 100% of their U.S. subsidiaries' reported U.S.profits. As a result, under water's edge combined reporting, separate accounting is only ignored for purely domestic businesses but retained for multinational corporations. Per the 2003-2004 Biennial Report of the Vermont Commissioner of Taxes, the adoption of unitary combined reporting [...] "will diminish opportunities for certain aggressive tax management strategies that were available to multi-state corporations and will help create a level playing field with respect to Vermont-based corporations." [...] Therefore, under water's edge, U.S. based and foreign-based multinationals have the ability to <b>shift</b> U.S. <b>profits</b> to foreign subsidiaries and avoid federal and state income taxes. <b>Profits</b> <b>shifted</b> out of the U.S. would be taxed only if and when they are repatriated as foreign dividends to a U.S. based multinational. Most foreign countries do not tax foreign dividends received by multinationals based in their countries so <b>profits</b> <b>shifted</b> out of the U.S. by U.S. subsidiaries owned by foreign based multinationals and later repatriated to the foreign parent are usually not taxed.|$|R

In fact, the strategy adopted by multinational firms for determining the transfer price (TP) of goods and services, as well as the shared amount of revenues and expenses have a major impact upon group profit and may contribute to divergent results. In order to get more profit, a coherent decision of delocalization should be based on an evaluation of all the operational and financial characteristics associated with such movement. Therefore, it is interesting to model these new constraints and integrate them in a more global decision model. The established model will enable to measure how much these financial constraints impact the decision of delocalization and will give new helpful directives for enterprise managers...|$|R
5000|$|When Thomas Jefferson, {{the third}} {{president}} of the United States, completed the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 he opened {{a great deal of}} free land for American fur traders. Forts quickly sprung up along rivers and overland trails to act as parts of the nationally run factory system. The factory system was a nationally funded and operated system, in which Native Americans would meet at certain forts and exchange furs for finished goods. The American government had hoped that nationalizing the fur trade would prevent the debauchery caused by the trading of alcohol with the Natives. The Factory System eventually failed for many reasons. First, the men working the factories were ex-military men and not experienced fur traders. These men often mishandled the furs resulting in major <b>profit</b> <b>shifts.</b> Second, the government failed to stop all private traders who bribed Natives with alcohol. Eager to get access to liquor, the Natives would break treaties with the government to get it. Lastly, the factories were not permitted to give presents to Natives or assimilate into Native culture as many private fur traders could. Miscegeny, or intermarriage between two cultures, was a major uniting force between private fur traders and natives that strengthened their relationship.|$|R
