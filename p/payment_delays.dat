50|$|The reverse {{factoring}} {{permits to}} gather all the suppliers in one financier, {{and that way}} to pay one company instead of many, which eases the invoicing management. The relation with the suppliers benefiting of the reverse factoring is improved because they benefit from a better financing solution, and their <b>payment</b> <b>delays</b> are reduced; for its part, the ordering party will gain some extra money reversed by the factor and pay his invoices to the due date. Making suppliers benefit from such advantages {{can be a powerful}} leverage in negotiation, and also ensure a more durable relation with the suppliers. Moreover, it ensures that the suppliers will be able to find advantaging financing in case of cash flow problem: using reverse factoring assures that the suppliers will still be in business, and are reliable.With the reverse factoring, instead of paying numerous suppliers, most of the invoices are centralized with the same factor; it is always better for the accounts department to deal with one company to pay than several. This can also be simplified and speeded by using a reverse factoring platform combined with digitalization of business transactions (i.e. EDI).|$|E

40|$|In {{developed}} countries in everyday business, <b>payment</b> <b>delays</b> often present a problem. <b>Payment</b> <b>delays</b> {{have already been}} a matter of discussion in Slovenia for several years. Irrespective of some positive movements in the past years, the state of payment discipline in Slovenia is not at a satisfactory level.

The findings are important not only for Slovenia, but also for other EU candidate countries faced with similar problems of transition. The paper has led to the following conclusions. Firstly, the more indebted companies have longer <b>payment</b> <b>delays.</b> Secondly, the longer the contractual payment period, the shorter the payment delay. Longer payment periods are mostly received by larger companies. And thirdly, the longer the <b>payment</b> <b>delays</b> on the side of companies. buyers, the higher the incidence of late payments by the company. We can therefore conclude, based on our research, that <b>payment</b> <b>delays</b> in Slovenia depend mostly on risks involved with doing business with firms in financial distress, in particular with small businesses...|$|E

40|$|Although {{significant}} {{research work}} has been conducted on cash flow forecast, planning, and management, the objective is constantly the maximization of profit/final cash balance, or minimization of total project cost. This paper presents a multi-objective fuzzy linear programming model (FLP) for resolving the optimization problem of three conflicting objectives: final cash balance, cost of money, and initial cash balance. The proposed model depends on Jiang et al. (2011) Model. In the new formulation, both the advanced <b>payment</b> and <b>delay</b> of owner's progress payment one period were considered. Literature concerned with cash flow studies and models for construction projects was reviewed. Fuzzy linear programming applications in literature was presented and it's concept was then described.

40|$|Abstract. We {{conduct a}} series of {{laboratory}} experiments designed to test if individual discount rates vary with the time horizon for which the rate is elicited. We conclude that preferences are not continuously hyperbolic, although observations generated in many prior experiments have appeared to reflect hyperbolic preferences. Such observations {{are consistent with the}} intrinsically confounded notions of a “passion for the present ” and other “subjective costs of any <b>delayed</b> <b>payment.</b> ” These result in a fixed premium being attached to <b>payment</b> options <b>delayed</b> beyond the present. We demonstrate the existence of this premium in choices involving an immediate payment option vs. a <b>delayed</b> <b>payment</b> option. When both <b>payment</b> options are <b>delayed,</b> the premium does not vary between the options, and thus does not enter into the choice between them. The revealed rates then do not vary with the choice horizon. To the extent that many significant field choices or policy decisions do not involve choices with immediate payoffs, the use of constant discount rates remains appropriate...|$|R
40|$|Financial {{supply chain}} {{management}} and working capital management are increasingly receiving attention as important avenues to increase profitability in supply chains. By actively managing payment terms and working capital requirements, managers can influence financial performance and achieve significant cost savings.

In our research we elaborate {{on the benefits of}} equally considering both operational and financial aspects in decision-making for the physical and financial supply chain.

Our results demonstrate the significance of payment delays: Increases/decreases in the upstream/downstream <b>payment</b> <b>delays</b> favor the system's operations by decreasing operational costs.

40|$|<b>Payment</b> <b>delays</b> {{and losses}} {{persist in the}} {{construction}} industry and continue to be a key concern to industry practitioners. Therefore an exploration of the key causes of <b>payment</b> <b>delays</b> and losses is undertaken in this study with the ultimate objective of seeking mitigating solutions. The study adopted a survey approach using an online questionnaire, administered to practitioners from the New Zealand construction industry, comprising consultants, head contractors and subcontractors. The data obtained was analysed using inferential statistical techniques, including comparing means and factor analysis. Factor analysis enabled clustering of the inter-related causes of <b>payment</b> <b>delays</b> and losses in order to find reduced number of causes. Accordingly, the study found that payment problems mainly relate to contractual issues, financial strength of industry players, disputes, short-comings of payment processes and ‘domino effects’. Among them, the financial strength of critical industry players was considered central to payment problems. The study concludes that any solution to these problems must address these primary causes, as a rational starting point. Thus procuring a feasible form of financial security at the outset of a project, and the pre-qualification of the financial status of critical project participants, were found to be significant in the mitigation of construction payment risks.

40|$|In this paper, {{we first}} {{document}} some stylized facts about very short-term and long-term corporate yield spreads. We find that short-term spreads are sizable, and {{the correlations between}} many firms' short-term and long-term yield spreads are at times negative. We then develop a structural model that generates levels and correlations of short-term and long-term spreads that are more consistent with what we observe. The model allows {{for the possibility of}} <b>payment</b> <b>delays</b> when a firm's liquid asset position deteriorates. <b>Payment</b> <b>delays</b> generate sizable short-term debt spreads because the realized returns on short-term investments are very sensitive to an increase in the holding period. The presence of liquidity risk can also explain negative correlations between short- and long-term spreads because liquidity risk is imperfectly correlated with insolvency risk. Using firm-level data, we provide empirical evidence that liquid assets holdings help predict short-term spreads, but not long-term spreads. Corporations; Payment systems; Econometric models...|$|E
