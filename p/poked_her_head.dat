500|$|McCay {{originally}} used {{a version}} of the film as part of his vaudeville act. [...] The first performance was on February8, 1914, in Chicago at the Palace Theater. [...] McCay began the show making his customary live sketches, which he followed with How a Mosquito Operates. [...] He then appeared on stage with a whip and lectured the audience on the making of animation. [...] Standing {{to the right of the}} film screen, he introduced [...] "the only dinosaur in captivity". [...] As the film started Gertie <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> out of a cave, and McCay encouraged her to come forward. [...] He reinforced the illusion with tricks such as tossing a cardboard apple at the screen, at which point he turned his back to the audience and pocketed the apple as it appeared in the film for Gertie to eat. [...] For the finale, McCay walked offstage from where he [...] "reappeared" [...] in the film; Gertie lifted up the animated McCay, placed him on her back, and walked away as McCay bowed to the audience.|$|E

6000|$|There {{followed}} a long moment. On {{the one side}} was that vinegary woman <b>poking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> forward like an angry hen, on the other, Daphne Wing, her eyes rounder and rounder, her cheeks redder and redder, her lips opening, her hands clasped to her perfect breast, and, in the centre, that broad, grey-bearded figure, with reddening face and angry eyes and hoarsening voice: ...|$|R
60|$|For {{some time}} after this, Mrs. Cluck kept her three {{remaining}} little ones close to her side, watching over them with maternal care, till they were heartily tired of her anxious cluckings. Peep and Peck were always together, being very fond of one another. Peep was a most inquisitive chicken, <b>poking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> into every nook and corner, and never satisfied till she had seen {{all there was to}} see. Peck was a glutton, eating everything she could find, and often making herself ill by gobbling too fast, and forgetting to eat a little gravel to help digest her food.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} it was ten o'clock and going on eleven, and all the town was as still as death, except the dogs. Pony's father kept on until he got down to the river-bank, where Jim Leonard's mother lived, and he had to knock and knock before he could make anybody hear. At last Jim Leonard's mother <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> out of the window and asked who was there, and Pony's father told her.|$|E
6000|$|The lamp went quite out, and the q-b gave a cry. The brown woman <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{through a}} hole in the wall. Beyond her we saw the flames of the cooking, and two devil-figures {{stirring}} the pots. The brown woman came and shook the lamp--it was like a stodgy porcelain mantelpiece vase--shook it well and stirred up its innards, and started it going once more. Then she appeared with a bowl of smoking cabbage soup, in which were bits of macaroni: and would we have wine? I shuddered at the thought of death-cold red wine of the country, so asked what else there was. There was malvagia--malvoisie, the same old malmsey that did for the Duke of Clarence. So we had a pint of malvagia, and were comforted. At least we were being so, when the lamp went out again. The brown woman came and shook and smacked it, and started it off again. But as if to say [...] "Shan't for you", it whipped out again.|$|E
6000|$|Early in {{the morning}} Grettel {{had to go out}} and hang up the kettle full of water, and light the fire. [...] "First we'll bake," [...] said the old dame; [...] "I've heated the oven already and kneaded the dough." [...] She pushed Grettel out to the oven, from which fiery flames were already issuing. [...] "Creep in," [...] said the witch, [...] "and see if it's {{properly}} heated, so that we can shove in the bread." [...] For when she had got Grettel in she meant to close the oven and let the girl bake, that she might eat her up too. But Grettel perceived her intention, and said: [...] "I don't know how I'm to do it; how do I get in?" [...] "You silly goose!" [...] said the hag, [...] "the opening is big enough; see, I could get in myself," [...] and she crawled toward it, and <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> into the oven. Then Grettel gave her a shove that sent her right in, shut the iron door, and drew the bolt. Gracious! how she yelled, it was quite horrible; but Grettel fled, and the wretched old woman was left to perish miserably.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are pretty}} and convenient, but I'm afraid {{they will be}} a trial to some of us. Maud and Nelly look the best, {{but they have to}} keep stiff and still, or the {{wrinkles}} come. Kit has no peace in hers, and poor Cordy looks more like a meal bag than ever, while I am a perfect spectacle, with my round shoulders and long thin arms. 'A jersey on a bean-pole' describes me; but let us be in the fashion or die," [...] laughed Sally, exaggerating her own defects by <b>poking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> forward and blinking through her glasses in a funny way.|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Trey Fanjoy. It features a model, (a then unknown Alana De La Garza of Law & Order fame) who is the central character of the video. It was shot in an abandoned warehouse, and shot in green. It was also the only video by the duo to be directed by Fanjoy. Throughout the video, the model is seen in different layouts. The duo are performing, with a full band, on a high platform, {{in front of a}} screen, projecting the model's scenes. The model is also seen <b>poking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> through thin blinds, seen as both the first, and last image of the video. The video was released in March 2001.|$|R
5000|$|Once there a {{passenger}} train speeds {{right past the}} station and Porky has to change the signal to stop the second train. Porky and Lulu get on board, but the conductor kicks them off, on account of a [...] "no pets" [...] rule. Porky then tells Lulu {{to go down to}} the tracks so he can pick her up when the train passes by. Porky gets on board and the train departs. When it passes by Lulu, Porky grabs her and pulls her in. Realizing what will happen if the conductor finds out, Porky shoves Lulu under his seat, but Lulu insists on <b>poking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> out. She then squeezes out and swallows passengers' personal belongings.|$|R

40|$|In lieu of an abstract, a short excerpt is provided: 2 ̆ 2 I was {{teaching}} high-school English on September 11, 2001. As my seniors finished their essay exams {{on the novel}} Siddhartha, a colleague <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> into my room to whisper to me, “There’s something going on at The World Trade Center. A plane flew {{into one of the}} buildings… and it might not have been an accident. ” As students finished their tests, I passed on this breaking news, which prompted one of my self-proclaimed globally aware students to ask, “The World Trade Center…that’s in D. C., right?” In subsequent days, students’ everyday lexicons grew to include places, phrases, and names like “Al-Qaeda,” “Osama bin Laden,” “twin towers,” and “global terrorist networks” as these attacks on the United States spawned a new awareness of the political struggles in and with countries of the modern Middle East. Yet it’s unsettling to me that, for my students as for many U. S. citizens, the narrative of “The War on Terror” begins with that cataclysmic event. The high school where I {{was teaching}} prides itself on nurturing globally informed, politically aware students, and developing students as “global citizens” is explicitly named as a school-wide core value. Perhaps it’s presumptuous to say that if my students entered the 9 / 11 / 01 era with little related global context, then the majority of U. S. high school students were similarly naïve. However, studies of both mainstream rhetoric and U. S. secondary schools suggest that the dominant American narrative begins on September 11 with a declaration that “they” (terrorists) attacked “us” (innocents) because they are evil and we stand for good. This bowdlerized version of the 9 / 11 / 01 story isn’t just a layman’s perspective; when articulated by the country’s leader and repeated endlessly on the airwaves, it saturates youth’s malleable sense of national identity. 2 ̆...|$|E
5000|$|Lastly, in his 1996 memoir The Attic, artist Guanlong Cao recalls an {{incidental}} {{benefit of}} kaidangku to his parents: When sister Chuen {{was three years}} old, she still wore open-crotch pants that revealed two banana-shaped slices of her bottom. She liked to climb the wooden ladder that leaned against the south window. The slanted roof outside the window was a constant temptation to her. But she was only allowed to climb three steps, <b>poke</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> outside, and sneak {{a peek at the}} world. As soon as her little foot moved toward the fourth rung of the ladder, a slap on the bottom was guaranteed. In addition to the hygienic convenience, I presume this was another technical advantage of the classic open-crotch pants.|$|R
50|$|As Pettis {{describes}} {{developments in}} the streamroom to Mancini, the scene is shown of three men and three women meeting in the steamroom of a luxury hotel {{as part of an}} online dating promotion, then being locked in together. When they discover that they have been locked in, they react badly: Frank (Quinn Duffy) becomes abusive to Jessie (Eve Mauro), and is killed in her defense by openly neurotic Margaret (Cordelia Reynolds). Jessie is killed with a nail gun by an unseen assailant when she <b>pokes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> through the small window in the steamroom door; Christopher (Patrick Muldoon) is injured in the hand with a nail as the window is boarded over from outside. Margaret becomes agitated and commits suicide. Grant (Eric Roberts) is bludgeoned by Catherine (Megan Brown) after he accuses her and Christopher of being allies of the perpetrators and repeatedly holds <b>her</b> <b>head</b> underwater.|$|R
5000|$|Tom, now {{deciding}} to meet force head-on, grabs a shotgun and chases Jerry, while Jumbo hides. Jumbo's mother then <b>pokes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{through the window}} and hugs him before scooping him up as Tom continues to shoot at Jerry. Jerry runs outside as Jumbo calls to him from the garage with a paintbrush, with Tom following. Jerry jumps out, followed by Jumbo and his mother, decked out in mouse colors too. The sight of this utterly terrifying display finally seems to break the poor cat completely. Tom leaps a foot back, and as his gun droops down like limp spaghetti, he lets out a nervous chuckle. Turning to face the camera, Tom grins insanely while mimicking the sizes of the [...] "mice" [...] before he runs off cackling maniacally (having gone insane) while breaking through a wall and a fence.|$|R
6000|$|The old Arab {{met them}} at the {{entrance}} to his tent. His eyes narrowed wickedly when they had appraised the newcomers. They stopped before him, exchanging greetings. They had come to trade for ivory they said. The Sheik grunted. He had no ivory. Meriem gasped. She knew that in a near-by hut the great tusks were piled almost to the roof. She <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> little <b>head</b> further forward {{to get a better view}} of the strangers. How white their skins! How yellow their great beards! ...|$|R
5000|$|Homer {{is shown}} leaving {{the power plant}} and, as in the {{previous}} opening sequences, the green uranium bar falls into his clothing as he leaves. This time, in the background of this scene, Lenny Leonard is standing on a ladder trying to change the [...] "days without an accident sign" [...] from 2 to 3 days but then falls off the ladder onto Carl Carlson who is standing {{at the bottom of the}} ladder. The scene changes to Marge at the supermarket check out. Among the products Marge is buying is Tomacco juice and Mr. Sparkle detergent. Maggie is scanned, and the price doubles from $243.26 to $486.52, before she is put in the shopping cart. When Maggie pops <b>her</b> <b>head</b> out of the paper bag, Marge looks relatively calm and does not panic, unlike in the previous sequences. Maggie shakes her fist at Baby Gerald, who is beside her in another shopping cart. In band practice, Mr. Largo dismisses Lisa, who plays a solo as she leaves and then <b>pokes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> back in the door to finish it. One notable difference from the previous opening sequence is Sherri and Terri, who are texting messages instead of playing their flutes.|$|R
60|$|Ducks, too, {{have been}} known to exhibit sociable and {{friendly}} traits. There is a story told of a drake who once came into a room where a young lady was sitting, and approaching her, caught hold of her dress with his bill and commenced to pull vigorously at it. The lady was very much surprised at this performance, and tried to drive the drake away. But he would neither depart or stop tugging at her dress, and she soon perceived that he wanted her to do something for him. So she rose from her chair, and the drake immediately began to lead her towards the door. When he had conducted her out on to the lawn, he led her to a little lake near the house, and there she saw what it was that troubled Mr. Drake. A duck, very probably his wife, had been swimming in the lake, and in <b>poking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> about, she had caught her neck in the narrow opening of a sluice-gate and there she was, fast and tight. The lady lifted the gate, Mrs. Duck drew out <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and went quacking away, while Mr. Drake testified his delight and gratitude by flapping his wings and quacking {{at the top of his}} voice.|$|R
5000|$|Aparicio {{was born}} in A Gudiña, Ourense, in the Galician region of Spain. He was the third child and only son of Juan de Aparicio and Teresa del Prado, who were poor, but pious peasants, and spent his {{childhood}} tending sheep and cattle and in service to those of means. He learned his prayers from his parents, but had no schooling, and {{was not able to}} read or write. Despite his illiteracy, he had absorbed the discourse on how to lead a pious and holy life that he could emulate models in hagiographic texts. [...] According to his own account, his life was saved in a seemingly-miraculous way during an outbreak of the bubonic plague in his town in 1514. Forced to isolate him from the community in quarantine, his parents built a hidden shelter for him in the woods, where they left him. While lying there helpless, due to his illness, a she-wolf found the hiding spot and, <b>poking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> into his hiding spot, sniffed and then bit and licked an infected site on his body, before running off. He began to heal from that moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Law? What's the use o' {{law when}} a man's once such a fool as {{to let a}} woman into his house?" [...] said Bartle, {{turning away from the}} hamper with some bitterness. He always called Vixen a woman, and seemed to have lost all {{consciousness}} that he was using a figure of speech. [...] "If I'd known Vixen was a woman, I'd never have held the boys from drowning her; but when I'd got her into my hand, I was forced to take to her. And now you see what she's brought me to--the sly, hypocritical wench"--Bartle spoke these last words in a rasping tone of reproach, and looked at Vixen, who <b>poked</b> down <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and turned up her eyes towards him with a keen sense of opprobrium--"and contrived to be brought to bed on a Sunday at church-time. I've wished again and again I'd been a bloody minded man, that I could have strangled the mother and the brats with one cord." ...|$|R
60|$|On the whole, then, {{the coming}} of the kid, {{who turned out to be}} called Elspeth, did not ostracize Tommy, but he wished that he had let the other girl in, for he never doubted that her {{admittance}} would have kept this one out. He told neither his mother nor his friend of the other girl, fearing that his mother would be angry with him when she learned what she had missed, and that Shovel would crow over his blundering, but occasionally he took a side glance at the victorious infant, and a poorer affair, he thought, he had never set eyes on. Sometimes it was she who looked at him, and then her chuckle of triumph was hard to bear. As long as his mother was there, however, he endured in silence, but the first day she went out in a vain search for work (it is about as difficult to get washing as to get into the Cabinet), he gave the infant a piece of his mind, <b>poking</b> up <b>her</b> <b>head</b> with a stick so that she was bound to listen.|$|R
40|$|This Fragile Land, though {{written for}} a popular audience, is not {{intended}} for children or for light bedtime reading. In language midway between academic discourse and good literary prose, Paul Johnsgard characterizes the plant and animal communities of the Sandhills thoroughly- and with humor and imagination. Part One describes the 2 ̆ 2 geology and historical geography 2 ̆ 2 of the Sandhills region and its borders; {{it is the only}} part that might be tedious for some. In his preface, Johnsgard advises readers to begin with Part Two and skip-and-sample backward. In five chapters, he details the geographic relationships of species 2 ̆ 7 habitats to one another and to the geologic features of the Sandhills themselves and the lands to the immediate north, west, south, and east. Part One is dry as blowsand, and readers who plod rather than skip may want the aid of one or two drinks. In Part Two, Johnsgard displays his gifts as a gossip and storyteller; here we get the lowdown on the neighbors, things like the mating rituals of grebes and the surprising viciousness of the grasshopper mouse. We learn that after the male brook stickleback 2 ̆ 7 s troubles in building a home, the first thing the female does is <b>poke</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> through the back wall; we learn that cliff swallows lay eggs in one another 2 ̆ 7 s nests, and that their oldest colonies are so infested with bedbugs that survival chances are better out in the burbs. Even the plant world is made fascinating as the author describes the struggle of plants on the higher slopes to avoid being either buried or excavated as the wind moves sand. Part Three consists of two cautiously worded chapters that plead for better management of the soil and groundwater. Johnsgard remarks on Nebraska state government 2 ̆ 7 s delays in implementing federal environmental law, and he tabulates the dangerously rising levels of nitrate and atrazine. But the author 2 ̆ 7 s wails are muffled, and the book ends with a conciliatory paragraph in which one can almost hear the professor 2 ̆ 7 s apologetic cough. The text proper is followed by a valuable reference section that includes a substantial compilation of appendices, a fourteen page bibliography, and two indexes. Taken together, these references amount to a hundred pages or a good two-fifths of the book, and it is here that those who wish to fight environmental battles will find ammunition...|$|R
60|$|The bride-maiden's glory was theirs by right, though Ethel was an {{unsatisfactory}} {{chief for}} such as desired splendour. She protested against anything incongruous with January, or {{that could not}} be useful afterwards, and Meta took her part, laughing at the cruel stroke they were preparing for Bellairs. Ethel begged for dark silks and straw bonnets, and Flora said that she had expected to hear of brown stuff and gray duffle, but owned that they had better omit the ordinary muslin garb in the heart of winter. The baby bride's-maid was, at last, the chief consideration. Margaret suggested how pretty she and Blanche would look in sky-blue merino, trimmed with swan's-down. Meta was charmed with the idea, and though Ethel stuck out <b>her</b> shoulder-blades and <b>poked</b> out <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> and said she should look like the ugly duckling, she was clamorously reminded that the ugly duckling ended by being a swan, and promised that she should be allowed a bonnet of a reasonable size, trimmed with white, for Mr. Rivers's good taste could endure, as little as Dr. May's sense of propriety, the sight of a daughter without shade to her face, Ethel, finally, gave in, on being put in mind that her papa had a penchant for swan's-down, and on Margaret's promising to wear a dress of the same as theirs.|$|R
6000|$|At {{last one}} day he found a caddis, and wanted it to peep out of its house: but its house-door was shut. He {{had never seen a}} caddis with a house-door before: so what must he do, the meddlesome little fellow, but pull it open, to see what the poor lady was doing inside. What a shame! How should you like to have any one {{breaking}} your bedroom-door in, to see how you looked when you where in bed? So Tom broke to pieces the door, which was the prettiest little grating of silk, stuck all over with shining bits of crystal; and when he looked in, the caddis <b>poked</b> out <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> and it had turned into just the shape of a bird's. But when Tom spoke to her she could not answer; for her mouth and face were tight tied up in a new night-cap of neat pink skin. However, if she didn't answer, all the other caddises did; for they held up their hands and shrieked like the cats in Struwelpeter: [...] "Oh, you nasty horrid boy; there you are at it again! And she had just laid herself up for a fortnight's sleep, and then she would have come out with such beautiful wings, and flown about, and laid such lots of eggs: and now you have broken her door, and she can't mend it because her mouth is tied up for a fortnight, and she will die. Who sent you here to worry us out of our lives?" ...|$|R
