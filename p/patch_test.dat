40|$|Epicutaneous <b>patch</b> <b>testing</b> is {{the gold}} {{standard}} method for the diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis. Despite this knowledge, many clinical dermatologists do not offer <b>patch</b> <b>testing</b> in their offices or offer testing with {{only a limited number}} of allergens. Introduced in 1995, the Thin-Layer Rapid Use Epicutaneous Test originally contained 23 allergens and one control. In 2007, five additional allergens were added. This United States Food and Drug Administration-approved <b>patch</b> <b>testing</b> system made <b>patch</b> <b>testing</b> more convenient, and after its introduction, more dermatologists offered <b>patch</b> <b>testing</b> services. However, the number of allergens in the Thin-Layer Rapid Use Epicutaneous Test remains relatively low. Every two years, the North American Contact Dermatitis Group collects and reports the data from <b>patch</b> <b>testing</b> among its members to a standardized series of allergens. In 2005 - 2006, the Group used a series of 65 allergens. Of the top 30 allergens reported in 2005 - 2006, 10 were not included in the Thin-Layer Rapid Use Epicutaneous Test. Knowledge of and testing for additional allergens such as these may increase <b>patch</b> <b>testing</b> yield...|$|R

The irritant anionic surfactant sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) may alter the stratum corneum and increase antigen penetration. Pre-treatment of the skin with SLS 0. 5 % for 24 h was performed in the sites of <b>patch</b> <b>tests</b> with patients' own products in 15 selected patients. In patients previously negative to their own products <b>tested</b> with conventional <b>patch</b> <b>tests,</b> SLS pre-treatment showed 6 new relevant positive reactions and induced a stronger positive reaction in 1 patient.

40|$|There {{are limited}} {{reports of the}} {{prevalence}} of positive reactions in healthy adults to <b>patch</b> <b>tests</b> with standard allergens; there are no recent comprehensive studies from Australia.

Seventy-seven (35 %) reacted {{to at least one}} allergen, positive <b>patch</b> <b>tests</b> being most prevalent to nickel sulfate (20 %), potassium dichromate (9 %), cobalt chloride (6 %) and fragrance mix (4 %). Prevalence of positive <b>patch</b> <b>tests</b> to nickel and chromate was higher than that reported for another healthy population, which may stem from self-selection of volunteers or geographical differences, including extent of exposure to allergens...|$|R
40|$|To {{find out}} the {{incidence}} of contact hypersensitivity due to various antibacterial agents, <b>patch</b> <b>tests</b> were performed with these medications in 101 patients suspected to havek developed contact dermatitis due to some such agent. Positive <b>patch</b> <b>tests</b> were obtained with nitrofurazone, (furacin) in 56 cases, neomycin in 28 cases penicillin in 12 cases, tyrothricin (tyroderm), gentamicin (genticyn), framycitin (soframycin) and oxytetracycline (terramycin) in 13 cases each, triple sulfa, and mercurochrome in 9 cases each and acriflavine in 4 cases. Two cases showed <b>patch</b> <b>tests</b> with brilliant green, but none with gentian violet. Twenty eight patients were negative with all drugs tested. Many patients showed positive <b>patch</b> <b>tests</b> {{with more than one}} antibacterial agent. Neomycin 20 % in petrolatum gave more frequent positive <b>patch</b> <b>tests</b> compared to the commericial 0. 35 % neomycin ointment or 20 % aqueous neomycin, but {{there was no significant difference}} between the commercial 0. 2 % nitrofurazone ointment, 2 % nitrofurazone in petrolatum of 22 controls, 6 patients showed positive <b>patch</b> <b>tests</b> with the commercial neomycin ointment as well as 20 % neomycin in petrolatum, 1 patient with 0. 2 % nitrofurazone ointment and 5 patients with 200 % nitrofurzone in petrolatum...|$|R

2500|$|Thiomersal {{is used in}} patch {{testing for}} people who have dermatitis, conjunctivitis, and other {{potentially}} allergic reactions. A 2007 study in Norway found that 1.9% of adults had a positive <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> reaction to thiomersal; a higher prevalence of contact allergy (up to 6.6%) was observed in German populations. Thiomersal-sensitive individuals can receive intramuscular rather than subcutaneous immunization, though there have been no large sample sized studies regarding this matter to date. [...] In real-world practice on vaccination of adult populations, contact allergy does not seem to elicit clinical reaction. Thiomersal allergy has decreased in Denmark, probably because of its exclusion from vaccines there. In a recent study of Polish children and adolescents with chronic/recurrent eczema, positive reactions to thiomersal were found in 11.7% of children (7–8 y.o.) and 37.6% of adolescents (16–17 y.o.). This difference in the sensitization rates can be explained by changing exposure patterns: The adolescents have received six thiomersal-preserved vaccines during their life course, with the last immunization taking place 2–3 years before the mentioned study, younger children received only four thiomersal-preserved vaccines, with the last one applied 5 years before the study, while further immunizations were performed with new thiomersal-free vaccines.|$|E
2500|$|For most people, {{irritation}} from formaldehyde {{is temporary}} and reversible, though formaldehyde can cause allergies and {{is part of}} the standard <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> series. In 2005–06, it was the seventh-most-prevalent allergen in patch tests (9.0%). [...] People with formaldehyde allergy are advised to avoid formaldehyde releasers as well (e.g., Quaternium-15, imidazolidinyl urea, and diazolidinyl urea). People who suffer allergic reactions to formaldehyde tend to display lesions on the skin in the areas that have had direct contact with the substance, such as the neck or thighs (often due to formaldehyde released from permanent press finished clothing) or dermatitis on the face (typically from cosmetics). Formaldehyde has been banned in cosmetics in both Sweden and Japan. The eyes are most sensitive to formaldehyde exposure: The lowest level at which many people can begin to smell formaldehyde is about 0.05 ppm and the highest level is 1 ppm. The maximum concentration value at the workplace is 0.3 ppm. In controlled chamber studies, individuals begin to sense eye irritation at about 0.5 ppm; 5 to 20 percent report eye irritation at 0.5 to 1 ppm; and greater certainty for sensory irritation occurred at 1 ppm and above. While some agencies have used a level as low as 0.1 ppm as a threshold for irritation, the expert panel found that a level of 0.3 ppm would protect against nearly all irritation. In fact, the expert panel found that a level of 1.0 ppm would avoid eye irritation—the most sensitive endpoint—in 75–95% of all people exposed.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} eventual {{contact sensitization}} in 7 patients with plasma cell vulvitis (PCV). STUDY DESIGN: Seven women with PCV underwent <b>patch</b> <b>tests</b> with the Italian standard series and with additional batteries of allergens (perfumes, preservatives, emulsifiers, medicaments and corticosteroid series). RESULTS: One patient experienced a positive reaction t o balsam of Peru and wool alcohol. CONCLUSION: <b>Patch</b> <b>testing</b> is not normally {{necessary in the}} management of PCV. However, when a patient with PCV complains of burning or pruritus after application of topical products, <b>patch</b> <b>tests</b> could prove useful...|$|R
40|$|Background: So far {{the issue}} of <b>patch</b> <b>tests</b> with mite allergens in {{subjects}} not affected by atopic dermatitis (AD) has been poorly investigated. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the frequency and intensity of responses to atopy <b>patch</b> <b>tests</b> with Dermatophagoides in non-AD subjects, and to compare them to the ones observed in AD patients. Methods: <b>Patch</b> <b>tests</b> were performed, employing a mixture of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and farinae at two different concentrations (20 and 40 % pet.), on 75 non-AD subjects, including 33 patients with allergic rhinitis and 42 healthy volunteers, and on 210 AD patients, as controls. Results: Positive responses to 20 % mite <b>patch</b> <b>tests</b> were observed in 17 non-AD subjects (23 %) and in 102 AD ones (49 %). The former showed a lower intensity of the responses, with a mean score of 1. 4 compared with 2. 1 in atopics. Conclusions: Although positive responses to mite <b>patch</b> <b>tests</b> are also observable in subjects without AD, their frequency and intensity are significantly lower compared with AD patients...|$|R

50|$|The <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> in {{the finite}} element method is a simple {{indicator}} {{of the quality of}} a finite element, developed by Bruce Irons.The <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> uses a partial differential equation on a domain consisting from several elements set up so that the exact solution is known. Typically, in mechanics, the prescribed exact solution consists of displacements that vary as linear functions in space (called a constant strain solution). The elements pass the <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> if the finite element solution {{is the same as the}} exact solution.|$|E

In this sense, a positive <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> to nickel establishes that the subject has been previously exposed and is therefore sensitized to nickel. It does not necessarily indicate that the patch reaction {{is the cause of}} the current clinical disease. A negative test demonstrates that the patient is sub-threshold, either minimally or not sensitized. Cumulatively, clinical reasoning and a <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> help determine if nickel could be the cause of a current dermatitis reaction.|$|E
