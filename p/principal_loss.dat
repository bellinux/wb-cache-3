The latter we call the monitor, whose type is initially unknown. Through repeated interaction the agent might learn his type. We show that this process damages the principal's payoffs. Compensation is assumed exogenous, limiting {{to a great extent}} the provision of incentives. We go around this difficulty by introducing costly replacement strategies, i. e. the principal replaces the monitor, thus disrupting the agent's learning. We found that even when replacement costs are null, if the revealed monitor is strictly preferred by both parties, there is a loss in efficiency due to the impossibility of beneâ€¦tting from it. Nonetheless, these strategies can partially recover the <b>principal's</b> <b>losses.</b> Additionally, we establish upper and lower bounds on the payoffs that the principal and the agent can achieve.

Clean cultivation, especially the complete elimination of wild sedges and rushes, suitable crop rotations, summer or early fall breaking of cultivated or infested wild sods, early planting of crops menaced by billbugs, and the protection of birds, especially ground feeders, including the bobwhite and the shore birds, are efficient methods for preventing crop losses by billbugs.

40|$|A <b>principal</b> <b>loss</b> {{mechanism}} for solar receivers in solar-thermal systems is {{radiation from the}} absorbing surface. This loss can be reduced by using the concept of directional selectivity in which radiation is suppressed at angles larger than the incident angle of the sunlight striking the absorber. Directional selectivity can achieve efficiencies similar to high solar concentration, without the drawbacks associated with large heat fluxes. A specularly reflective hemispherical cavity placed over the absorber can reflect emitted radiation back to the absorber, effectively suppressing emission losses. An aperture in the cavity will still allow sunlight to reach the absorber surface when used with point focus concentrating systems. In this paper the reduction in radiative losses {{through the use of}} a hemispherical cavity is predicted using ray tracing simulations, and the effects of cavity size and absorber alignment are investigated. Simulated results are validated with proof of concept experiments that show reductions in radiative losses of more than 75 % from a near blackbody absorber surface.
