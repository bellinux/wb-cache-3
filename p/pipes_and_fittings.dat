5|$|When {{the plant}} was started up for testing on {{schedule}} in November, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment because {{of the power of}} the magnets and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December, Groves ordered a magnet broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Groves then ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned. A pickling plant was established on-site to clean the <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings.</b> The second Alpha I was not operational until the end of January 1944; the first Beta and first and third Alpha I's came online in March, and the fourth Alpha I became operational in April. The four Alpha II racetracks were completed between July and October 1944.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for {{the design}} and {{construction}} of the electromagnetic separation plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which {{came to be called}} Y-12, was assigned to Stone & Webster. The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II.

5|$|The first submarine, , {{was laid}} down in February 1990. Collins launch was {{originally}} planned for 1994, but was later set for 28 August 1993. Although launched on schedule, she was not complete: {{the design of the}} submarine had not been finalised, important internal <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings</b> were not installed, the components of the combat system had yet to be delivered, and some hull sections were actually sheets of timber painted black so the submarine would appear complete in photographs of the launching ceremony. Within weeks of the launch, Collins was removed from the water, and it was not until June 1994 that the submarine was completed. Progress on the other five submarines was delayed by the extra effort required to meet Collins launching date and the subsequent work to complete her. Collins was not commissioned into the RAN until 27 July 1996; eighteen months behind schedule, because of several delays and problems, most relating to the provision and installation of the combat data system software. Collins was not approved for operational deployments until 2000.|$|E

25|$|MDPE {{is defined}} by a density range of 0.926–0.940nbsp&g/cm3. MDPE can be {{produced}} by chromium/silica catalysts, Ziegler-Natta catalysts, or metallocene catalysts. MDPE has good shock and drop resistance properties. It also is less notch-sensitive than HDPE; stress-cracking resistance is better than HDPE. MDPE is typically used in gas <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings,</b> sacks, shrink film, packaging film, carrier bags, and screw closures.|$|E
25|$|The pipe wrench, or Stillson wrench, is an {{adjustable}} wrench used for turning soft iron <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings</b> with a rounded surface. The {{design of the}} adjustable jaw allows it to rock in the frame, such that any forward pressure on the handle tends to pull the jaws tighter together. Teeth angled {{in the direction of}} turn dig into the soft pipe. The pipe wrench was invented by Daniel C. Stillson in 1869.|$|E
25|$|The {{launch of}} Collins was {{originally}} planned for 1994, but was later set for August 1993. The submarine was launched by shiplift on 28 August 1993. Although launched on schedule, {{she was not}} complete: {{the design of the}} submarine had not been finalised, important internal <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings</b> had not been installed, the components of the combat system had not been delivered, and some sections of 'hull' were sheets of timber painted black so the submarine would appear complete in photographs of the launching ceremony. Within weeks of the launch, the boat was removed from the water, and it was not until June 1994 that she was completed. Work on the other submarines in the class was delayed by the extra effort put in for Collins to meet her launching date, and by the subsequent work to complete her. The submarines are covered in a skin of anechoic tiles to minimise detection by sonar: Collins was retrofitted with the tiles after the standard sonar signature of the submarine had been established, while the other five boats were covered during construction.|$|E

500|$|The highly {{corrosive}} {{nature of}} uranium hexafluoride threw up several technological challenges. <b>Pipes</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings</b> {{that it came}} into contact with had to be made of, or clad with nickel. This was fine for small objects, but impractical for the large diffusers, the tank-like containers that had to hold the gas under pressure. Nickel was a vital war material, and although the Manhattan Project could use its overriding priority to acquire it, making the diffusers out of solid nickel would deplete the national supply. The director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr., gave the contract to build the diffusers to Chrysler. In turn, its president, K. T. Keller assigned [...] Carl Heussner, an expert in electroplating, the task of developing a process for electroplating such a large object. Senior Chrysler executives called this [...] "Project X-100".|$|E

From this final project analysis a solution to prevent the company from continuous losses shall be found. After the analysis is made, the most probable cause of the decrease beside the macro economic crisis happening in Indonesia is the wrong strategy stated by the company.
