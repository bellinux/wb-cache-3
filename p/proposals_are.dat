5|$|Redevelopment <b>proposals</b> <b>are</b> ongoing as of 2014.|$|E
5|$|At present, only Deutsche Bahn {{has applied}} {{for use of the}} line and in 2009 {{regulations}} were relaxed to allow its trains to use the Channel Tunnel. Other <b>proposals</b> <b>are</b> yet to be formalised.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the more}} unusual <b>proposals</b> <b>are</b> that the Eskaya people are a Semitic proto-Christian tribe; that they possess the lost book of Enoch; that they are descended from the {{builders}} of King Solomon's temple; that their existence proves the imminence of a second Messiah in Bohol; or that they guard esoteric secrets.|$|E
50|$|Two <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> made. The first project <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> not {{approved}} (2005) and the second, modified <b>proposal,</b> <b>was</b> approved (2006).|$|R
5000|$|... 4. Promisor and {{promisee}} 2(c) :- When the <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> accepted, {{the person}} making the <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> called as promisor {{and the person}} accepting the <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> called as promisee.|$|R
50|$|A similar <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> {{made in the}} Constitution Alteration (Local Government) 2013, {{but that}} <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> not {{submitted}} to a referendum.|$|R
5|$|Although the {{original}} plan for Regional Eurostar services to destinations north of London was abandoned, the significantly improved journey times available since the opening of High Speed 1 — which is physically connected to both the East Coast Main Line and the North London Line (for the West Coast Main Line) at St Pancras — and the recently increased maximum speeds on the West Coast Main Line may make potential Regional Eurostar services more commercially viable. This {{would be even more}} likely if <b>proposals</b> <b>are</b> adopted for a new high-speed line from London to the north of Britain.|$|E
5|$|For example, in March 2009, as {{a result}} of the late-2000s {{financial}} crisis, the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation pressed for urgent consideration of a new international reserve currency and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development proposed greatly expanding the I.M.F.'s special drawing rights. Conspiracy theorists fear these <b>proposals</b> <b>are</b> a call for the U.S. to adopt a single global currency for a New World Order.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{the federal}} {{constitutional}} initiative allows citizens {{to put a}} constitutional amendment to a national vote, if 100,000 voters sign the proposed amendment within 18 months. The Federal Council and the Federal Assembly can supplement the proposed amendment with a counter-proposal, and then voters must indicate a preference on the ballot in case both <b>proposals</b> <b>are</b> accepted. Constitutional amendments, whether introduced by initiative or in parliament, must be accepted by a double majority of the national popular vote and the cantonal popular votes.|$|E
50|$|Under the Commonwealth, <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> {{advanced}} for {{the establishment}} of an expanded, Polish-Lithuanian-Muscovite or Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian, Commonwealth. These <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> never implemented.|$|R
5000|$|... 2. Acceptance 2(b):- When {{the person}} to whom the <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> made, signifies his assent there to, the <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> said to be accepted.|$|R
5000|$|Twenty <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> submitted. On 27 May 2008, {{the anniversary}} of the Operation Anthropoid, a <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> chosen. The authors of the winning <b>proposal</b> <b>were</b> artists David Moješčík and Michal Šmeral, and architects Miroslava Tůmová and Jiří Gulbis. Moješčík and Šmeral had {{previously}} collaborated on various projects in connection with [...] "public art".|$|R
5|$|After {{the first}} solo flights glider pilots are {{required}} to stay within gliding range of their home airfield. In addition to solo flying, further flights are made with an instructor until the student is capable of taking a glider cross-country and of handling more difficult weather. Cross-country flights are allowed when they have sufficient experience to find sources of lift away from their home airfield, to navigate, and to select and land in a field if necessary. In most countries pilots must take a written examination on the regulations, navigation, use of the radio, weather, principles of flight and human factors. <b>Proposals</b> <b>are</b> being made to standardise the training requirements across European countries.|$|E
5|$|As Master of the Rolls he {{selected}} cases he {{felt to be}} particularly important to hear and, rather than having an American system (where judges had a rota for taking cases), assigned cases to those judges who had expertise in that particular area of law. In 1963 he chaired a committee investigating {{ways to reduce the}} archive of legal documents kept by the Public Record Office; by that point the files for civil cases of the High Court alone occupied four miles of shelving. The final report was presented to the Lord Chancellor on 16 May 1966, with the conclusion being that 'if our <b>proposals</b> <b>are</b> implemented the Public Record Office alone will be relieved of two hundred tons of records (occupying 15,000 feet of shelving)'. The Lord Chancellor took Denning's report to heart, and had the changes he recommended implemented immediately.|$|E
5|$|To {{the north}} of the Bath Road is Prospect Park, a large urban park {{surrounding}} the Mansion House. Development to the south of Southcote is restricted by the Holy Brook and the Great Western Main Line, and although the land is used for recreation, <b>proposals</b> <b>are</b> occasionally put forward to build housing on the floodplains. The land south of the railway line is subject to a Tree Preservation Order (TPO). This land is defined by Reading Borough Council as Southcote Meadows, and stretches from the Burghfield Road (near to the western boundary of Southcote) to Milkmaid's Bridge at the foot of Southcote Lock. Other parts of Southcote are subject to similar restrictions, including areas adjacent to (but north of) the railway embankment, trees lining the Kennet and Avon Canal west of Southcote Lock, and various individual sites.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second round}} of awards covered the Implementation and Interoperability Tracks for which full <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> due on August 30, 2012. Four more <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> awarded: ...|$|R
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1887, no {{alternative}} site had become available and the original <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> renewed. There were slight amendments made to the proposals, but again the <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> rejected.|$|R
5000|$|These <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> greatly {{controversial}} (especially in Rutland, {{which put}} forth a counter-suggestions to add surrounding areas to Rutland instead from surrounding counties) and the final <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> watered down somewhat ...|$|R
25|$|Unsolicited <b>proposals</b> <b>are</b> made {{regularly}} by citizens, {{agencies and}} corporations of Toronto.|$|E
25|$|The Butter Market is also due for {{refurbishment}} and <b>proposals</b> <b>are</b> being examined.|$|E
25|$|These are {{countries}} where concrete flat tax <b>proposals</b> <b>are</b> being considered by influential politicians or political parties.|$|E
50|$|Republic P-44 Rocket (1941) {{single-engine}} single-seat propeller fighter aircraft. The <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> for a P-43-based fighter {{with larger}} engine. The <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> rejected (no prototype built) {{in favor of}} the P-47 Thunderbolt.|$|R
5000|$|According to Section 2(b), [...] "When {{the person}} to whom the <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> made, signifies his assent thereto, the <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> said to <b>be</b> accepted. A <b>proposal,</b> when accepted, becomes a promise." ...|$|R
5000|$|Awards {{were given}} in two rounds. In {{the first round}} which dealt only with the Conceptualization track, for which full <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> due on July 26, 2012, three DIBBs <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> awarded: ...|$|R
25|$|Though not a full reconstruction, Pulleyblank's {{work has}} been very influential, {{and many of his}} <b>proposals</b> <b>are</b> now widely accepted.|$|E
25|$|The Uralic family {{comprises}} nine undisputed {{groups with}} no consensus classification between them. (Some of the <b>proposals</b> <b>are</b> {{listed in the}} next section.) An agnostic approach treats them as separate branches.|$|E
25|$|An east-west bypass for the A570 at Ormskirk {{is planned}} to relieve {{congestion}} on Southport's main access route to the motorway network, although {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>proposals</b> <b>are</b> still under debate.|$|E
50|$|Another <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> {{known as}} the Birch Spur Incline. This would have {{involved}} the line continuing from Summit to Birch Spur from where a rope-worked incline would convey traffic to the valley floor where the railway would continue through a narrow valley to the Wairarapa plains. The Public Works Department engineers investigating this <b>proposal</b> <b>were</b> unable to locate a suitable incline, so this <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> also abandoned.|$|R
50|$|While this <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> {{approved}} by Pershing, it met some resistance when {{it reached the}} Secretary of War. With an initial price tag of almost $800,000 just to open the field, the <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> rejected by the Secretary of War on 19 May 1917. That same day the <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> resubmitted with the additional argument that a facility such as the 3d AIC was critical {{to the development of}} the air forces that would accompany the A.E.F. to Europe. This time the <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> accepted and by July 1917 the first Aero Construction Squadrons began to arrive in France.|$|R
50|$|<b>Proposals</b> <b>were</b> later {{made for}} {{additional}} {{members of the}} class WU to be built. However, the class lacked the ability to cope with post-World War II traffic, and therefore the <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> never realised.|$|R
25|$|This {{category}} of whaling {{is separated from}} IWC-regulated whaling by international law. Special permit research <b>proposals</b> <b>are</b> to be submitted by countries to the IWC for scientific scrutiny. The role of the IWC is advisory only.|$|E
25|$|In January 2017, the governor's office {{announced}} closure by 2020-21. The closure, {{along with}} pollution control, challenges New York's {{ability to be}} supplied. Among the solution <b>proposals</b> <b>are</b> storage, renewables (solar and wind) and new transmission cables from Canada.|$|E
25|$|Each year, Ikeda {{publishes a}} peace {{proposal}} which examines global {{challenges in the}} light of Buddhist teachings and suggests specific actions to further peace and human security. The <b>proposals</b> <b>are</b> specific and wide-ranging, covering topics as constructing a culture of peace, promoting the development of the United Nations, nuclear disarmament, the prohibition of child soldiers, the empowerment of women, the promotion of educational initiatives in schools such as human rights and sustainable development education, and calls to reawaken the human spirit and individual empowerment. The complete texts of recent <b>proposals</b> <b>are</b> available at the SGI website. Olivier Urbain, Director of the Toda Institute for Global Peace and Policy Research, has published a compilation of topical excerpts from past proposals, with a focus {{on the role of the}} United Nations.|$|E
2500|$|Another <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> {{known as}} the Birch Spur Incline. [...] This would have {{involved}} the line continuing from Summit to Birch Spur from where a rope-worked incline would convey traffic to the valley floor where the railway would continue through a narrow valley to the Wairarapa plains. [...] The Public Works Department engineers investigating this <b>proposal</b> <b>were</b> unable to locate a suitable incline, so this <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> also abandoned.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, a <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> {{brought to}} the South Kingstown Planning Board to convert the Miller property, along with other {{adjacent}} properties, to a 48-unit multi-household development. The redevelopment <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> denied in October 2014.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, {{a number}} of <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> raised to {{complete}} the development. None proceeded. In 1998, these <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> revised {{to reduce the number}} of lots from 88 to 40 and more than halve the occupancy from 1328 to 638. With some minor alterations, this <b>was</b> the <b>proposal</b> which <b>was</b> finally agreed.|$|R
