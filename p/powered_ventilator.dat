50|$|A {{whole house}} fan {{is a type}} of fan, or exhaust system {{commonly}} venting into a building's attic, designed to circulate air in a home or building. It is sometimes confused with a <b>powered</b> attic <b>ventilator,</b> which exhausts hot air from the attic to the outside through an opening in the roof or gable at a low velocity.|$|R
50|$|<b>Powered</b> attic <b>ventilators,</b> by comparison, {{only serve}} to remove some hot air from the attic. Intake air comes {{directly}} from outside, instead of from the house interior. Attic ventilators are used when air intake from the house is not desirable, such as when the interior is air-conditioned. Typical diameter is 24 in, having motors of power , and using 120 to 600 watts of electric power.|$|R
50|$|Older {{machines}} {{may lack}} {{some of the}} safety features and refinements present on newer machines.

50|$|To win the prize, Alberto Santos-Dumont {{decided to}} build {{dirigible}} No. 5, a larger craft than his earlier designs. On August 8, 1901 {{during one of his}} attempts, the airship began to lose gas, causing the envelope to lose shape and making it necessary to shut down the engine, which also <b>powered</b> the <b>ventilator</b> which inflated the internal ballonet. It started to descend and was unable to clear the roof of the Trocadero Hotel. Santos-Dumont was left hanging in a basket {{from the side of the}} hotel. With the help of firemen he escaped without injury, but the airship was a write-off, only the engine being salvaged.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>powered</b> attic <b>ventilator,</b> or attic fan, is a {{ventilation}} fan which regulates the heat {{level of a}} building's attic by exhausting hot air. A thermostat is used to automatically turn the fan off and on, while sometimes a manual switch is used. An attic fan can be gable mounted or roof mounted. Additional vents are required to draw in fresh air as the hot air is exhausted. Attic fans are typically used in warmer months, when temperatures in an attic can exceed [...] A fan may be installed in an attic for the different purpose of cooling a whole house, venting hot air out via the attic; such fans are often called whole-house fans.|$|R
30|$|In 1991, Fleur T. Tehrani {{patented}} a targeting scheme {{based on}} Eq. 13. The system was designed to “…reduce the load on the respiratory muscles, mimic natural breathing, stimulate spontaneous breathing, and reduce weaning time” [20]. Interestingly, the initial implementation of this targeting scheme was not to minimize <b>power</b> delivery from <b>ventilator</b> to patient [21], but rather to select initial settings and “…choose a breathing pattern that encourages the patients to breathe on their own as early as possible” [22]. Note {{that the development of}} this targeting scheme was almost a decade before intensive research on the role of tidal volume dosage on mortality. At that time, the concern was to avoid an excessively large tidal volume, not to minimize it. Nevertheless, over the years, ASV has proven to be effective and results in relatively protective tidal volume delivery in the range of 8.1 [*]±[*] 1.4  mL/kg ideal body weight [23].|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on design {{simulations}} by the means of commercial software for a low speed circuit wind tunnel with an open test section, recently built at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Mechatronics and Materials Technology at THM University of Applied Sciences in Friedberg. The proposed wind tunnel has a test section with cross sectional area of 1 X 1 m 2 and a length of 1. 6 m. The maximum achievable speed is about 50 m/s with empty test section. The simulation had the target to propose and to verify various geometries - test chamber, tunnel contraction, diffuser etc. as well the tunnel corner including the vanes. In addition, {{the influence of the}} vanes number and their shape on the <b>ventilator</b> <b>power</b> needed and the flow velocity uniformity as well, have been subjects of the investigation.

40|$|A {{paediatric}} ventilator {{has been}} designed basically as a fluidic-logic controlled T-piece occluder. lnspiratory and expiratory time, inflation pressure limit, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and inspiratory flow-rate are controlled independently and intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) is available. Warning systems are provided for failure of the driving gas, low airway pressure and inspiratory pressure limit. The breathing circuit is isolated from the control and warning systems for ease of sterilization. Recently, the design of ventilators for use in paedi-atric anaesthesia has been based commonly on the intermittent occlusion of the expiratory limb of an Ayre's T-piece circuit. Ward (1975) suggested that, in this situation, fluidic control systems would have certain advantages, {{not the least of}} which would be the high degree of reliability conferred by the use of very few moving parts and by the use of the same gas source both as supply to the patient and as <b>power</b> for the <b>ventilator.</b> Accounts of suitable fluidic circuits have been published previously by Meye...|$|R
30|$|The ICU {{physicians}} had {{to complete}} 11 specific tasks for each ventilator, four mainly dedicated to monitoring and seven to setting: (a) alarm control (users must shut down alarms, identify the reason and modify setting to stop alarms); (b) mode recognition (exact {{reading of the}} ventilator mode set by investigator); (c) identify humidification system {{on the screen and}} modify it; (d) ventilator setting reading (VT, ventilation rate, PEEP and trigger value); (e) power on the ventilator; (f) start ventilation; (g) set inspiratory flow to a value defined by the investigator (40 – 80  L min− 1); (h) ventilator mode modification; (i) set cycling to 60 %; (j) non-invasive ventilation mode activation; and (k) ventilator extinction (complete <b>ventilator</b> <b>powering</b> down). In each group of tests (i.e. monitoring or setting), tasks were to be performed in a randomized order. The test was a priori considered as a failure if the correct response was given after more than 120  s, or if the physicians did not provide a correct response or abandoned the task. Due to technical constraints, we chose not to use a high-fidelity environment with a manikin, but to perform measurements with the ventilators connected solely to the test lung. Besides a task failure rate evaluation, these scenarios were also dedicated to enable usability and mental workload scoring using psycho-cognitive scales.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE:: Selected optimal {{respiratory}} cycles {{should allow}} calculation of respiratory mechanic parameters focusing on patient-ventilator interaction. New computer software automatically selecting optimal breaths and respiratory mechanic derived from those cycles are evaluated. DESIGN:: Retrospective study. SETTING:: University level III {{neonatal intensive care}} unit. SUBJECTS:: Ten mins synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation and assist/control ventilation recordings from ten newborns. INTERVENTION:: The ventilator provided respiratory mechanic data (ventilator respiratory cycles) every 10 secs. Pressure, flow, and volume waves and pressure volume, pressure flow, and ventilator volume flow loops were reconstructed from continuous pressure/volume recordings. Visual assessment determined assisted leak-free optimal respiratory cycles (selected respiratory cycles). New software graded the quality of cycles (automated respiratory cycles). Respiratory mechanic values were derived from both sets of optimal cycles. We evaluated quality selection and compared mean values and their variability according to ventilatory mode and respiratory mechanic provenance. To assess discriminating power, all 45 "t" values obtained from interpatient comparisons were compared for each respiratory mechanic parameter. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: A total of 11, 724 breaths are evaluated. automated respiratory cycle/selected respiratory cycle selections agreement is high: 88 % of maximal kappa with linear weighting. Specificity and positive predictive values are 0. 98 and 0. 96, respectively. Averaged values are similar between automated respiratory cycle and ventilator respiratory cycle. C 20 /C alone is markedly decreased in automated respiratory cycle (1. 27 +/- 0. 37 vs. 1. 81 +/- 0. 67). Tidal volume apparent similarity disappears in assist/control: automated respiratory cycle tidal volume (4. 8 +/- 1. 0 mL/kg) is significantly lower than for ventilator respiratory cycle (5. 6 +/- 1. 8 mL/kg). Coefficients of variation decrease for all automated respiratory cycle parameters in all infants. "t" values from ventilator respiratory cycle data are {{two to three times}} higher than ventilator respiratory cycles. CONCLUSIONS:: Automated selection is highly specific. Automated respiratory cycle reflects most the interaction of both ventilator and patient. Improving discriminating <b>power</b> of <b>ventilator</b> monitoring will likely help in assessing disease status and following trends. Averaged parameters derived from automated respiratory cycles are more precise and could be displayed by ventilators to improve real-time fine tuning of ventilator settings. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Mist eliminators (also called droplet eliminators, droplet {{separators}} or demisters) are {{devices that}} can remove liquid droplets from a gas flow. The gas flow laden with droplets {{is forced to}} pass through different channels, changing direction in a repetitive manner. Wave-plate (or vane type) eliminator are widely employed in chemical and industrial processes involving gas and vapour flows where mist removal is necessary for several reasons. For instance, {{one of the most}} important objectives is to restrict pollutant emission into the environment, as in cooling towers applications. Wave-plate mist eliminators can operate in vertical and horizontal situations, but in both cases, the removal of liquid droplets occurs mainly by inertial impaction. In cooling towers, spraying water is distributed over a heat transfer surface across or through which a stream of air is passing. Thus, water droplets can be captured by the stream of air and they will be carried out of the system. This phenomenon is known as drift. In countries with warm climate, inside the cooling towers the conditions of high temperature and humidity can strongly induce the spreading of pathogens agents, especially the Legionella pneumophila. The main disadvantage of installing mist (i. e., drift) eliminators is an increased pressure loss of the airflow. High-pressure loss contributes to lower flow rate of air or higher engine <b>power</b> of the <b>ventilators.</b> This fact leads to obtain lower overall efficiency values for the air-conditioning systems. Since a lack of systematic studies on comparative evaluation of morphologically similar separators has been detected, the behaviour of four wave-type eliminators having a similar geometry is studied. Both droplet collection efficiency and the pressure drop coefficient are calculated. Special emphasis is made on the validation of the numerical model with results taken from the literature, the study of the effects of relevant parameters, and the achievement of a procedure to evaluate the overall efficiency of each regarded type of eliminator. The obtained results may contribute to improve the passive droplets restraint systems in mechanical cooling towers, increasing the overall operation of the cooling tower on one side, and lowering their environmental impact on the other...|$|R
