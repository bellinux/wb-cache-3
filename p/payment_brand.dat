40|$|Striking {{the right}} balance between the {{protection}} of competition law and intellectual property rights is of utmost importance, especially in the pharmaceutical sector; affordable generic drugs {{are as important as}} new innovative drugs. Pay-for-delay settlements take place at exactly this intersection. They end patent infringement litigation but, at the same time, delay entry of generic drugs by means of a substantial <b>payment</b> from the <b>brand</b> company to the generic. Whereas the US Supreme Court opted for a rule of reason approach that requires an analysis of the potential anticompetitive effects, the European Commission regarded such settlements as restriction by object, finding an infringement without the need for an effects-based analysis. This approach is criticised and a novel ‘structured effects-based’ approach is proposed allowing the authority to effectively scrutinise such settlements while striking {{the right balance}} {{in order to protect the}} innovative process and the exercise of intellectual property rights...|$|R
50|$|Clancy {{served only}} one term as a TD. He was not re-selected as the Sinn Féin {{candidate}} for Sligo {{for the general}} election of May 1921. The RIC County Inspector {{thought that this was}} because his 'views were not extreme enough - he did not approve of police murders etc.'; Sinn Féin headquarters queried his deselection but received no response from Sligo. Clancy had fallen out with the local IRA over finance. On the instructions of the Dáil, Sligo County Council refused to submit its accounts for audit to the British authorities, who then withdrew all grants and loans, causing a financial crisis and a large increase in the rates. The County Council called on the IRA for assistance with rate collection, but they raided rate collectors and tendered to the Council money which had already been collected. They also demanded £1,000 as poundage or commission but this was refused on the basis that they had not collected the money. Clancy on his own responsibility offered them £500; they refused and ordered him to have £1,000 ready 'or take the consequences'. Clancy handed over the money. The <b>payment</b> was <b>branded</b> 'entirely irregular' by Richard Mulcahy, IRA Chief of Staff, and after an investigation, Sligo IRA was ordered to repay the money but apparently never did. Farry comments that 'Clancy's initial refusal of the IRA's demand for payment for collecting the rates was not forgiven by that body. This may also explain why he, the sitting TD for North Sligo, was not selected for the 1921 election'.|$|R
40|$|Rising traffic {{congestion}} {{and the need}} to improve operational efficiency prompted the Illinois Tollway Authority to unveil plans to reconfigure its road network for “stop-free” electronic toll collection. Committing to an extensive construction program would have required the Tollway to ensure that enough drivers had electronic <b>payment</b> devices (<b>branded</b> as I- PASS). Conversely, without reconfigured toll gates the drivers would have had less reason to own an I-PASS. To resolve this potentially thorny chicken-and-egg problem, the Tollway put in place a new I-PASS distribution network and then dramatically raised the price for cash toll payments. This paper focuses on consumer response to the change in relative prices. Using tollway traffic data, we document a substantial aggregate increase in electronic toll payments. The propensity to pay electronically rose uniformly throughout the day, reflecting the effectiveness of the Tollway’s actions in modifying behavior of both commuters and leisure drivers.; However, not all drivers appear to have responded to the price change per se. To analyze the relative importance of price, income, and fixed participation costs we use the Census tract level data on employment and residential location to construct a ZIP-code measure of the likelihood of commuting to work via the tollway. Conditional on this measure, we show that the adoption of electronic payments among lower-income households was indeed influenced by the price change. In contrast, high- and medium-income households responded to lower fixed costs of obtaining I-PASS at conveniently located supermarkets. Finally, we document the role of social network relationships, as changes in I-PASS ownership for all income groups were strongly affected by I-PASS use among neighbors and co- workers.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{a study on}} important attributes which should be considered by the supplier in buying situations in the electronic manufacturing services (EMS) market. Hence, the importance level of attributes is investigated to see which attributes {{are more or less}} important when business-to-business (B 2 B) customers place an order. This can be interpreted as the relationship between the created value and the accompanying cost. For the success of this research work, both the qualitative and quantitative methods need to be applied. The importance of nine aspects is examined including: <b>payment</b> term, warranty, <b>brand,</b> product quality, delivery, packaging, certificates, supporting service and after-sales service. To identify which one is significant, a classification of the twenty-three attributes covering the nine aspects is conducted using Kano’s evaluation table. The findings through this research indicate that delivery, product quality and supporting service are the three most important aspects. A focus on these aspects is supposed to help the company to get value for the customers and also bring significant benefits for that company...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} legal questions in the pharmaceutical industry today concerns settlements of patent infringement suits between branded and generic drug companies. These settlements, which are by-products of the Hatch-Waxman Act, involve <b>payments</b> from the <b>branded</b> manufacturer to the generic drug company in exchange for the generic company staying off the market for a period of time. For nearly a decade, courts considering this issue applied a scope of the patent test to determine the validity of these settlements. Over time, increasing deference was given to a presumption of patent validity, and almost all challenged settlements were deemed valid. In June 2012, the Third Circuit applied a quick look rule of reason test and found the settlement in question invalid. The Third Circuit’s departure from the prevailing approach taken by its sister circuits marked a shift towards stricter scrutiny and created a circuit split. After almost a decade of effort by the Federal Trade Commission to get this issue before the Supreme Court, certiorari was granted to a patent settlement case out of the Eleventh Circuit, Actavis. It was the Third Circuit’s decision in favor of the FTC’s position that clinched the effort this time. Following Actavis, reverse-payment settlements are not categorically immune from the antitrust laws even when within the scope of the patent. Lower courts must now weigh the settlement’s possible pro-competitive benefits against its potential anticompetitive effects. As a result, the doors have been reopened for pharmaceutical competition...|$|R
