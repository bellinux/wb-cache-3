This study was done to assess the accuracy and reliability of an oximetrically confirmed <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> in measuring the transvalvular pressure gradient and valve area in patients with mitral stenosis. In 10 patients with mitral stenosis (1 man and 9 women; mean age ± SD 47 ± 7 years), <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> was measured through an 8 F Goodale-Lubin catheter with its wedge position confirmed by oximetry (oxygen saturation ≥ 95 %). In addition, a transseptal left atrial pressure was measured through a Brockenbrough catheter and left ventricular pressure was measured through a pigtail catheter. The mean and phasic left atrial and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressures</b> were similar (mean left atrial pressure 18 ± 6 mm Hg; mean <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> 18 ± 8 mm Hg; p = NS). When the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> was used without adjustment for time delay, the transvalvular pressure gradient (9. 8 ± 3. 3 mm Hg) and valve area (1. 5 ± 0. 5 cm 2) were significantly different (p < 0. 05) from the values obtained with use of left atrial pressure (7. 2 ± 2. 9 mm Hg and 1. 7 ± 0. 6 cm 2, respectively). In contrast, when the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> was adjusted for the time delay through the pulmonary vasculature, the difference in gradients averaged only 1. 7 mm Hg and the mitral valve areas were similar.

The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the correlations between Doppler-derlved transmitral flow velocity variables and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> in patients with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Background. Abnormal relaxation and increased chamber stiffness have opposing effects on the left ventricular filling pattern. When both abnormalities are present at the same time, as often occurs in patients with systolic dysfunction, the ability of Doppler recording to assess diastolic function and predict left ventricular fillng pressure may be significantly compromised. Method. <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> and Doppler transmitral flow velocity profile were simultaneously recorded in 140 postinfarction patients with ejection fraction ≤ 35 %. Results. Correlation between the ratio of mitral peak low velocity in early diastole to peak low velocity in late diastole (E/A ratio) and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> was weak (r = 0. 65). Although the specificity of E/A ≥ 2 in predicting ≥ 29 mm Hg in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> was high (99 %), its sensitivity was low (43 %). Conversely, a very close negative correlation was found between mitral deceleration time of early filling and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> (r = − 0. 91).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{identify}} the hemodynamic determinants of ground-glass opacification on thin-section computed tomographic (CT) scans of hydrostatic pulmonary edema and to compare attenuation and subjective assessments of ground-glass opacification with extravascular lung water. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Left atrial pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, effective <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> <b>pressure,</b> and extravascular lung water were measured in six dogs {{before and during}} progressive increase of effective <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> <b>pressure.</b> A thin-section CT scan was obtained at each step.

RESULTS: Ground-glass opacification was identified when effective <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> <b>pressure</b> equaled critical <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> <b>pressure.</b> Extravascular lung water increased, and the distribution curve of lung attenuation coefficients shifted to higher attenuation from the second measurement at an effective <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> <b>pressure</b> greater than the critical <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> <b>pressure.</b> Attenuation was highly correlated (r = 0. 98, P <. 001) with extravascular lung water; ground-glass opacification was detected before a significant (P =. 615, analysis of variance) increase in extravascular lung water.

Using first pass radionuclide angiography, curves for left ventricular systolic function (stroke work versus end-diastolic volume) and a measure of diastolic compliance (<b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> versus end-diastolic volume) were generated by changing body position to alter venous return. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume ranged from 41 to 111 ml/m 2 and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> from 0 to 24 mm Hg. No significant changes were found in blood pressure (150 / 83 to 148 / 82 mm Hg), heart rate (66. 7 to 67. 1 beats/min), cardiac index (2. 38 to 2. 41 liters/min per m 2), ejection fraction (0. 56 to 0. 54), end-systolic volume index (31. 4 to 32. 2 ml/m 2), end-diastolic volume index (65. 9 to 69. 5 ml/m 2) or <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> (7. 5 to 7. 3 mm Hg).

We estimated the tissue blood volume using 51 Cr-labeled red cells, the extracellular space using 99 mTc-DTPA (diethylene triamine pentacetic acid), and the albumin space using 125 I-labeled human serum albumin. An afferent lymphatic to the left tracheobron-chial node was cannulated for measurement of lymph flow, total protein and albumin concentration. Total extravascular water (Qw), extravascular "Tc-DTPA space, extravascular albumin content, and albumin space were calculated in lung tissue samples taken during a baseline period and during steady states, following increases in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> <b>pressure.</b> Lymph flow increased by 0. 20 -fold, and Qw by 0. 05 g/g blood free dry weight for each cm H 2 O increase in capillary pressure over the range of capillary pressures used in this study.

This excluded volume fraction decreased to approximatley 10 % of the extravascular 99 Tc-DTPA space at capillary pressures above 30 cm H 2 O.

40|$|AbstractPulmonary {{hypertension}} {{in chronic}} mitral valve disease has been related most commonly to {{left ventricular dysfunction}} or mitral stenosis; its association with chronic, isolated mitral regurgitation and preserved left ventricular systolic function is unclear. In 41 catheterized patients with chronic mitral regurgitation (known history of mitral regurgitation for > 18 months) and preserved left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction > 0. 55), historic, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic and hemodynamic variables were analyzed. Ten patients (Group 1) had normal pulmonary artery systolic pressure (> 30 mm Hg), whereas 31 patients had pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was mildly increased (30 to 49 mm Hg) in 13 patients (Group II) and was > 50 mm Hg in 18 patients (Group III). Univariate analysis showed the more frequent occurrence of male gender and ruptured chordae tendineae in the groups with pulmonary hypertension. Mean <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure,</b> size of the V wave in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> and <b>pulmonary</b> arteriole resistance were higher, whereas cardiac index was lower in the hypertension groups.

40|$|Although chronic normobaric hypoxia (CH) alters lung function, its {{potential}} to induce bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) is still controversial. Thus the effects of CH on airway and tissue mechanics separately and changes in lung responsiveness to methacholine (MCh) were investigated. To clarify the mechanisms, mechanical changes were related to end-expiratory lung volume (EELV), in vivo results were compared with those in vitro, and lung histology was assessed. EELV was measured plethysmographically in two groups of rats exposed to 21 days of CH (11 % O(2)) or to normoxia. Total respiratory impedance was measured under baseline conditions and following intravenous MCh challenges (2 - 18 microg x kg(- 1) x min(- 1)). The lungs were then excised and perfused, and the pulmonary input impedance was measured, while MCh provocations were repeated under a <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> <b>pressure</b> of 5, 10, and 15 mmHg. Airway resistance, tissue damping, and elastance were extracted from the respiratory impedance and pulmonary input impedance spectra. The increases in EELV following CH were associated with decreases in airway resistance, whereas tissue damping and elastance remained unaffected. CH {{led to the development}} of severe BHR to MCh (206 +/- 30 vs. 95 +/- 24 %, P < 0. 001), which was not detectable when the same lungs were studied in vitro at any <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> <b>pressure</b> levels maintained.

A higher plasma concentration of this peptide with a given <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> was found after 24 hours of treatment with 2. 5 mg and 5 mg of ramipril. Plasma concentration of the active metabolite, change in arginine vasopressin concentration or degree of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition did not significantly predict change in plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide or in the ratio of atrial natriuretic peptide concentration to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure.</b> CONCLUSIONS [...] A gradual increase in plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide with a given <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure,</b> occurs during short term high degree inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme. The causative mechanisms are yet to be identified. Such a change in {{the relation between}} central haemodynamics and atrial natriuretic peptide concentration may contribute to the beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in patients with congestive heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease...|$|R
40|$|A {{retrospective}} study {{of our experience}} in the placement of 19 consecutive balloon-tipped catheters in the pulmonary artery of 18 children disclosed that the procedure can be performed with relative ease {{in the intensive care}} unit without the aid of fluoroscopy. Insertion of the catheters was not associated with any serious complications. Catheter malfunction, however, occurred in 9 of 18 patients: balloon rupture in 6 and clot formation in 3. Comparison of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> <b>pressure</b> through a balloon-tipped catheter and venous pressure through a central venous line indicates that, in the absence of significant pulmonary disease requiring high positive end expiratory pressure, or significant left heart dysfunction, a central venous pressure line is frequently adequate for monitoring right heart pressures and as a guidance to fluid therapy...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{mechanisms}} of brain death (BD) -induced lung injury remain incompletely understood, as uncertainties persist about time-course and {{relative importance of}} mechanical and humoral perturbations. Methods: Brain death was induced by slow intracranial blood infusion in anesthetized pigs after randomization to placebo (n = 11) or to methylprednisolone (n = 8) to inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), wedged PAP (PAWP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and effective <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> <b>pressure</b> (PCP) were measured 1 and 5 hours after Cushing reflex. Lung tissue was sampled to determine gene expressions of cytokines and oxidative stress molecules, and pathologically score lung injury. Results: Intracranial hypertension caused a transient increase in blood pressure followed, after brain death was diagnosed, by persistent increases in PAP, PCP and the venous component of PVR, while PAWP did not change. Arterial PO 2 /fraction of inspired O 2 (PaO 2 /FiO 2) decreased. Brain death {{was associated with a}}n accumulation of neutrophils and an increased apoptotic rate in lung tissue together with increased pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL) - 6 /IL- 10 ratio and increased heme oxygenase(HO) - 1 and hypoxia inducible factor(HIF) - 1 alpha expression. Blood expressions of IL- 6 and IL- 1 β were also increased. Methylprednisolone pre-treatment was associated with a blunting of increased PCP and PVR venous component, which returned to baseline 5 hours after BD, and partially corrected lung tissue biological perturbations. PaO 2 / FiO 2 was inversely correlated to PCP and lung injury score. Conclusions: Brain death-induced lung injury may be best explained by an initial excessive increase in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> <b>pressure</b> with increased pulmonary venous resistance, and was associated with lung activation of inflammatory apoptotic processes which were partially prevented by methylprednisolone.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to measure the cardiac constraining effect of the lungs during positive end-expiratory pressure and relate extracardiac pleural pressure (radial stress) to airway pressure, right atrial pressure and left ventricular filling. Background. During positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation, the extracardiac pressure is elevated, and therefore intracavitary filling pressure does not reflect ventricular preload. Estimates of this pressure might be useful clinically to assess left ventricular preload. Methods. In eight patients who had undergone coronary or valvular surgery and whose pericardium was left widely open, a flat pleural balloon transducer was placed over the anterolateral left ventricular wall. We recorded <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure,</b> right atrial pressure and left ventricular short-axis end-diastolic area by transesophageal echocardiography. Incremental positive end-expiratory pressure was applied. Results. Extracardiac pleural pressure increased (p < 0. 01) from 0. 6 ± 1. 8 (±SD) to 2. 4 ± 1. 8, 5. 3 ± 1. 5 and 8. 2 ± 1. 5 mm Hg at a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5, 10 and 15 cm H 2 O, respectively. The slope relating extracardiac pleural pressure to positive end-expiratory pressure (in mm Hg) was 0. 70 ± 0. 10, and the intercept was zero. Increasing extracardiac pleural pressure was associated with a progressive increase in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> and a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic area. Consequently, although <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> and left ventricular area changed in opposite directions, the value of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> minus extracardiac pleural pressure correlated positively with left ventricular area (r = 0. 95, p < 0. 001). Changes in right atrial pressure (Pra) correlated with changes in extracardiac pleural pressure (Ppleural) : ΔPra = − 0. 3 + 0. 56 · ΔPpleural (r = 0. 89, p < 0. 001). Conclusions. In postoperative patients with open pericardium, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> minus extracardiac pleural pressure predicts left ventricular end-diastolic area during positive end-expiratory pressure. Further studies should be done to determine whether the observed relations between airway pressure and extracardiac pleural pressure and between right atrial pressure and extracardiac pleural pressure may give clinically useful estimates of left ventricular preload during positive end-expiratory pressure...|$|R
40|$|Background—Cinaciguat (BAY 58 – 2667) is {{the first}} of a new class of soluble {{guanylate}} cyclase activators in clinical development for acute decompensated heart failure. We aimed to assess the hemodynamic effects, safety, and tolerability of intravenous cinaciguat in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (<b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> 18 mm Hg). Methods and Results—After initial dose finding (part A; n 27), cinaciguat was evaluated in the nonrandomized, uncontrolled proof-of-concept part of the study (part B; n 33) using a starting dose of 100 g/h, which could be titrated depending on hemodynamic response. Patients were categorized as responders if their <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> decreased by 4 mm Hg compared with baseline. Final doses of cinaciguat after 6 hours of infusion in part B were 50 g/h (n 2), 200 g/h (n 12), and 400 g/h (n 16). Compared with baseline, a 6 -hour infusion of cinaciguat led to significant reductions in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> (7. 9 mm Hg), mean right atrial pressure (2. 9 mm Hg), mean pulmonary artery pressure (6. 5 mm Hg), pulmonary vascular resistance (43. 4 dynes · s · cm 5), and systemic vascular resistance (597 dynes · s · cm 5), while increasing heart rate by 4. 4 bpm and cardia...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{characterize}} the circulatory changes which may lead to pulmonary edema following the surgical placement of a LeVeen peritoneovenous shunt, intraoperative hemodynamic studies were performed on five consecutive patients without clinical evidence of cardiac disease undergoing shunt insertion. Within 30 minutes after opening the peritoneovenous shunt, there was a marked increase in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure,</b> cardiac output, and stroke work index, and {{a sharp decline in}} both pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances. In three patients, pulmonary edema did not occur; in one patient, pulmonary edema occurred transiently but responded to furosemide administration. In these four patients, systemic vascular resistance continued to drop over the ensuing hours and the elevated <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> also decreased appropriately with furosemide. The fifth patient developed persistent pulmonary edema. In this subject, systemic vascular resistance continued to rise and the elevated <b>pulmonary</b> <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> did not respond to intravenous furosemide. This study suggests that uncomplicated LeVeen peritoneovenous shunt insertion may result in a drop in systemic vascular resistance which lowers left ventricular afterload, and, thus, may protect most patients from pulmonary edema. In contrast, a continued rise in systemic vascular resistance and afterload may contribute to pulmonary edema refractory to diuretic therapy and should probably be treated with a parenteral afterload-reducing agent...|$|R
